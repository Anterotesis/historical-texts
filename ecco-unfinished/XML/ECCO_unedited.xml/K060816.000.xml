<HEAD>THE
PUBLISHER
TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>CVstom having made a Preface or Epistle to the Reader almost necessa∣ry,
I shall so far comply as to give some short Account of the follow∣ing
Treatises. The Reputation of the Author is so well establish'd,
that I shall wave all that might be said upon that Head, and only desire the
Reader to observe, that soon after his Decease, his Papers were, by his Re∣lations,
committed to my care to Publish what I thought might prove ac∣ceptable
to the Learned, which I have endeavour'd in this Volume.</P>
<P>The Tracts here Publish'd are for the most part Lectures, made and read
by him at several distant times upon different Subjects, which the Reader
is here presented with as the Author left them; for I was unwilling to Mo∣del
or Methodize them a new, by reducing the Subjects and Discourses of
many Lectures into one continu'd Discourse, as his method has been in
the Treatises formerly Publish'd by him in Quarto; much less have I ven∣tur'd
upon any Epitome, Abridgments too often distorting and curtailing
the Author's true Sense, and disguising it so, that his own Sentiments are
hard to be distinguish'd and always dubious, which Errors I have desir'd as
much as possible to shun. I am sensible, by publishing his Discourses thus at
large, some Recapitulations have been unavoidable, especially in Discourses
of this Nature, which it is possible may disgust some nice Criticks; never∣theless
I hope the Canded Reader will not find these Repetitions so many or
large, as to be dissatisfy'd thereat, most, if not all of them, containing some
new Matter added to what was said before.</P>
<P>The Subjects here handl'd are some of the most difficult in <HI>Natural Phi∣losophy,</HI>
and the Discourses were all well accepted and approv'd of when
read before competent Judges of the <HI>ROYAL SOCIETY,</HI> at their usual
Meetings.</P>
<P>The first contains a general Scheme or Draught of a method of advanc∣ing
and promoting <HI>Natural Philosophy,</HI> shewing its present deficiency,
with the several Queries to be made, and how they may be answer'd to ren∣der
it more instructive and beneficial. It must be granted the last and chief
Part of this <HI>Physical Algebra,</HI> or <HI>New Organ,</HI> viz. The method of
ranging the Experiments and Observations in order, so as to frame and
raise <HI>Axioms</HI> from them is wanting (which I believe was never wrote by the
Author) however I make no doubt but what is here offer'd will prove accep∣table
for the many curious Informations and Experiments therein contain'd.</P>
<P>What follows is a Collection of several Lectures concerning the Nature
of <HI>Light,</HI> in which its Cause, Motion, Action, Velocity and Properties
are largely treated of, with many new, useful and entertaining Subjects, ei∣ther
more copiously handled or hinted <HI>in Transitu.</HI> Tho' the Author has
not in these Discourses treated of the several alterations and affections of
the Rays of <HI>Light</HI> from <HI>Reflection, Inflection,</HI> and <HI>Refraction,</HI> &amp;c.
<PB REF="6"/>
as his intention was to do (which is evident from several Passages in his
Writings) yet the Learned will here meet with several no less difficult than
curious Matters explain'd, among the rest that great Problem of <HI>Memory,</HI>
which is here at least intelligibly explicated with the Organs, necessary to
perform that action of the Mind, or <HI>Reflection,</HI> which Organs possibly are
not immaterial or incorporeal</P>
<P>From this Contemplation he comes to treat of Time and Duration, shew∣ing
whence we gain the Notion of it, which he supposes from the formation
of, and impressions upon sensible and coporeal <HI>Ideas,</HI> or Images stored up in
the Repository of the Brain, tho' he positively asserts the recipient and di∣recting
Power or <HI>Soul to be a self-moving immaterial Being.</HI></P>
<P>Next to this is a <HI>Physical Treatise of Comets,</HI> proving from many
Observations, that they are actually burning Bodies, with an account of the
unconceivable Velocity of the motion of the Flashes or Accension of the
Steames in the Blaze or Taile far surpassing those of Light'ning: To
this is join'd the Author's <HI>Hypothesis</HI> of the cause of <HI>Gravity,</HI> a
Subject that has hitherto puzzl'd, as well as exercis'd the most ingenious
Heads. This <HI>Hypothesis</HI> is deduc'd from Mechanick Principles, and
back'd with Experiments; to which is added a short Account of his <HI>Hypo∣thesis
of Magnetism.</HI></P>
<P>After these are many Lectures concerning the external Shell or <HI>Super∣fices
of the Earth,</HI> of the Cause and Original of Mountains, Vallies and
Lakes. Of Fossile Shells, and other marine Remains found on the highest
Hills over most part of the known World, with Historical Accounts of
<HI>Earthquakes,</HI> fiery Eruptions, Deluges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and a Physical Interpreta∣tion
of the most antient <HI>Mythologick Representations of Natural Hi∣story.</HI>
In these Lectures the figure of the Terraqueous Globe and encom∣passing
Air is prov'd from the diurnal Motion and Gravitation.</P>
<P>Lastly, I have Added some Lectures relating to the <HI>Improvement of
Astronomy</HI> and <HI>Navigation,</HI> wherein, tho' I cannot promise the Reader
the Invention of the <HI>Longitude,</HI> or the like great Matters, yet I hope they
will prove agreeable for the several new and useful Suggestions and Instru∣ments
therein mention'd and describ'd, with some new methods of making
Observations at Land and Sea, to determine the true Meridian La∣titude
of the Place, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In all these Discourses I have fairly and truly given the Author's own
Opinions and Reasonings in his own words, with the several times when
they were read before the <HI>ROYAL SOCIETY,</HI> when I could any way
discover them.</P>
<P>I could wish the Author had himself fitted these Papers for the Press in
his Life time, or at least stich'd the several agreeing Subjects together,
which would have prevented some Errors that possibly have happen'd in the
Order and Disposition of them, for which I desire the Reader to accept this
Excuse, that several of his Papers came to my Sight and Hands, when
others that might better have follow'd them, were Printed off.</P>

<HEAD>THE
LIFE
OF
Dr. Robert Hooke.</HEAD>
<P>UNnderstanding that it would be acceptable to several Lear∣ned
and Ingenious Persons to have some publick Account
given of the Life, Studies and Employments of so know∣ing
and diligent an Inquirer into Nature, as Dr. <HI>Robert
Hooke</HI> is generally allow'd to have been, and who was one of the
greatest Promoters of Experimental Natural Knowledge, as well
as Ornaments of the last Century (so fruitful of great <HI>Genii</HI>) I could
not well refuse that Task, which (knowing my own insufficiency
for such an Attempt) I could hardly undertake, being conscious it
requir'd a Person much better qualify'd with natural and acquir'd
Abilities to perform it with Satisfaction; especially in so judicious
and nice an Age, more ready to find Faults than pardon Mistakes:
Besides my desire has always been not to expose my self to Censure,
when I might live quietly, <HI>Studiis ignobilis otii.</HI> But the following
Papers of Dr. <HI>Hooke</HI> having been put into my Hands to be Publish'd,
I was, in some manner, oblig'd to appear in print. What Mistakes
the Candid Reader may observe, in the following Relation of his
Life, I hope he will obligingly pardon. In which I profess the ut∣most
Sincerity, the greatest part of my Vouchers being either ta∣ken
out his own Memorials, or from the Journals of the Royal So∣ciety.</P>
<P>Had Dr. <HI>Hooke</HI> prosecuted a Design which I find he once pro∣posed
to himself, my present Undertaking had been as vain as need∣less,
for in a small Pocket-Diary of his I found these Words written.</P>
<P>“<HI>Saturday April</HI> the 10<HI>th</HI> 1697. I began this Day to write the
History of my own Life, wherein I will comprize as many re∣markable
Passages, as I can now remember or collect out of such
Memorials as I have kept in Writing, or are in the Registers of
the ROYAL SOCIETY; together with all my Inventions, Ex∣periments,
Discoveries, Discourses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which I have made, the
time when, the manner how, and means by which, with the suc∣cess
and effect of them, together with the state of my Health,
my Employments and Studies, my good or bad Fortune, my
Friends and Enemies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all which shall be the truth of Matter
of Fact, so far as I can be inform'd by my Memorials or my own
Memory, which Rule I resolve not to transgress.”</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="8"/>
Accordingly I found a beginning of his Life, which tho' it af∣fords
but little satisfaction, being only concerning his Childhood,
yet I have here given an Abstract of what is contained in it.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Robert Hooke</HI> was Born at <HI>Freshwater,</HI> a Peninsula on the West
side of the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> on the eighteenth of <HI>July,</HI> being <HI>Saturday,</HI>
1635, at twelve a Clock at Noon, and Christened the twenty sixth
following by his own Father Minister of that Parish.</P>
<P>He was very infirm and weakly, and therefore Nurst at Home,
tho' his Brothers and Sisters were Nurst Abroad; and for at least
seven Years his Parents had very little hopes of his Life, being of∣ten
sick; all which time his chief Food was Milk, or things made
thereof, and Fruits, no Flesh in the least agreeing with his weak
Constitution.</P>
<P>For his Age he was very sprightly and active in Running, Leap∣ing,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> tho' very weak as to any robust Exercise: Was very apt
to learn any thing, and after his English soon learnt his Grammar
by Heart; but, as he says, with but little understanding, till his
Father designing him for the Ministry, took some pains to instruct him. But he still being often subject to the Head-ach which hinder∣ed
his Learning, his Father laid aside all Thoughts of breeding
him a Scholar, and finding himself also grow very infirm through
Age and Sickness, wholly neglected his farther Education, who be∣ing
thus left to himself spent his time in making little mechanical
“Toys, (as he says) in which he was very intent, and for the Tools
he had successful; so that there was nothing he saw done by any
Mechanick, but he endeavoured to imitate, and in some parti∣culars
could exceed (which are his own words.”) His Father ob∣serving
by these Indications, his great inclination to Mechanicks,
thought to put him Apprentice to some easy Trade (as a Watch∣makers
or Limners) he shewing most inclinations to those or the
like curious Mechanical Performances; for making use of such
Tools as he could procure, “seeing an old Brass Clock taken to pieces,
he attemted to imitate it, and made a wooden one that would go:
Much about the same time he made a small Ship about a Yard
long, fitly shaping it, adding its Rigging of Ropes, Pullies, Masts,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> with a contrivance to make it fire off some small Guns, as it
was Sailing cross a Haven of a pretty breadth: He had also a
great fancy for drawing, having much about the same Age Cop∣pied
several Prints with a Pen, that Mr. <HI>Hoskins</HI> (Son to the fa∣mous
<HI>Hoskins Cowpers</HI> Master) much admired one not instructed
could so well imitate them.”</P>
<P>These Indications of a Mechanick Genius appeared in him when
very young; for by the same Paper I find that his Father died in
<HI>October</HI> 1648, having for three or four Years before his Death been
much afflicted with a Cough, a Palsy, Jaundice and Dropsy.</P>
<P>This is the sum of what he has left of his own Writing, by which
we find him at the time of his Fathers Death, to be thirteen Years
and about three Months Old.</P>
<P>This early Propensity of his to Mechanicks was a sign of his fu∣ture
Excellency in such Contrivances, and admirable Facility he
afterwards manifested in applying Mechanical Principles to the ex∣plication
of the most difficult <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Nature, and I remem∣ber
it has been often observed by several Persons, that whatever <HI>ap∣paratus</HI>
he contrived for the exhibiting any Experiment before the
<PB N="iii" REF="9"/>
ROYAL SOCIETY, it was performed with the least Embarrass∣ment
clearly and evidently, to explain the present Subject, which
was a sufficient proof of his true knowledge of the Mechanical
Powers, and of a method of applying them to the Explication of Nature.</P>
<P>How he spent the next six or seven Years of his Life I have
not been particularly informed; but I understand he was for some time
with Sir <HI>Peter Lely,</HI> how long I am not certain: I suppose but a
short time; for I have heard that the smell of the Oil Colours did not
agree with his Constitution, increasing his Head-ach, to which he
was ever too much subject.</P>
<P>It was after this that he lived with Dr. <HI>Busby,</HI> the late famous
Master of <HI>Westminster-School,</HI> as a Scholar in his own House, where
with more diligence he apply'd himself to <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek,</HI> in which
he made a sufficient proficiency for the time, and had a competent
Knowledge, and at the same time got some insight into the <HI>Hebrew</HI>
and some other Oriental Languages. While he liv'd with Dr. <HI>Bus∣by</HI>
he fell seriously upon the study of the Mathematicks, the Dr.
encouraging him therein, and allowing him particular times for
that purpose. In this he took the most regular Method, and first
made himself Master of <HI>Euclide</HI>'s Elements, and thence proceeded
orderly from that sure Basis to the other parts of the Mathematicks,
and after to the application thereof to Mechanicks, his first and last
Mistress.</P>
<P>From <HI>Westminster-School</HI> he went to the University of <HI>Oxford,</HI> in
1653. but as 'tis often the Fate of Persons great in Learning to
be small in other Circumstances, his were but mean. I find that he
was a Student of <HI>Christ-Church,</HI> tho' not of the Foundation, but
was, as I have heard, a Servitor to one Mr. <HI>Goodman,</HI> and took his
Degree of <HI>Master of Arts</HI> several Years after, about 1662, or 1663.</P>
<P>About the Year 1655, he began to shew himself to the World,
and that he had not spent his Juvenile Years in vain; for there be∣ing
a Concourse at that time of extraordinary Persons at <HI>Oxford,</HI>
each of which afterwards were particularly distinguish'd for the
great Light they gave the Learned World by their justly admired
Labours; he was soon taken notice of, and for his Facility in Me∣chanick
Inventions much priz'd by them.</P>
<P>For the proof of his being at this time brought into the acquain∣tance
of these great Men, I shall transcribe some Passages which I
met with among his Manuscripts; and first speaking of their Phi∣losophical
Meetings at <HI>Oxford,</HI> he says,</P>
<P>“At these Meetings, which were about the Year 1655 (before
which time I knew little of them) divers Experiments were sug∣gested,
discours'd and try'd with various successes, tho' no other
account was taken of them but what particular Persons perhaps
did for the help of their own Memories; so that many excellent
things have been lost, some few only by the kindness of the Au∣thors
have been since made publick; among these may be reckon'd
the Honourable Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI>'s <HI>Pneumatick Engine</HI> and Experiments,
first Printed in the Year 1660. for in 1658, or 9, I contriv'd and
perfected the Air-pump for Mr <HI>Boyle,</HI> having first seen a Contri∣vance
for that purpose made for the same honourable Person by
Mr. <HI>Gratorix,</HI> which was too gross to perform any great matter.”</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="10"/>
The Draught of this Air-pump and all its parts, as it was after
Publish'd by Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> I have now by me design'd by Mr. <HI>Hooke,</HI>
and I have heard him say, he was then sent to <HI>London</HI> by Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI>
to get the Barrel and other parts for that Engine which could not
be made at <HI>Oxford.</HI> But to return to some other Notes.</P>
<P>“The same Year I contriv'd and made many trials about the Art
of flying in the Air, and moving very swift on the Land and Wa∣ter', of which I shew'd several Designs to Dr. <HI>Wilkins</HI> then <HI>War∣den</HI>
of <HI>Wadham College,</HI> and at the same time made a Module,
which, by the help of Springs and Wings, rais'd and sustain'd it
self in the Air; but finding by my own trials, and afterwards by
Calculation, that the Muscles of a Mans Body were not suffici∣ent
to do any thing considerable of that kind, I apply'd my Mind
to contrive a way to make artificial Muscles; divers designs where∣of
I shew'd also at the same time to Dr. <HI>Wilkins,</HI> but was in ma∣ny
of my Trials frustrated of my expectations.”</P>
<P>What is mention'd here of his attempts about flying, is con∣firm'd
by several Draughts and Schemes upon Paper, of the Me∣thods
that might be attempted for that purpose, and of some con∣trivances
for fastening succedaneous Wings, not unlike those of
Bats, to the Arms and Legs of a Man, as likewise of a Contri∣vance
to raise him up by means of Horizontal Vanes plac'd a little
aslope to the Wind, which being blown round, turn'd an endless
Screw in the Center, which help'd to move the Wings, to be ma∣nag'd
by the Person by this means rais'd aloft: These Schemes I
have now by me, with some few Fragments relating thereto, but
so imperfect, that I do not judge them fit for the Publick. But to
return to his own Notes.</P>
<P>“About this time having an opportunity of acquainting my self
with Astronomy by the kindness of Dr. <HI>Ward,</HI> I apply'd my self
to the improving of the <HI>Pendulum</HI> for such Observations, and in the
Year 1656, or 57, I contriv'd a way to continue the motion of
the <HI>Pendulum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tom. 1. Lib. 2. Cap. 20. &amp; 21.</NOTE> so much commended by <HI>Ricciolus</HI> in his <HI>Almagestum,</HI>
which Dr. <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard</HI> had recommended to me to peruse; I made some
trials for this end, which I found to succed to my wish.”</P>
<P>“The success of these made me farther think of improving it for
finding the Longitude, and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">I never could meet with what is menti∣oned here, and in several o∣ther places of his Tracts al∣ready Printed, and of those contained in this Volume, <HI>of a method for Mechanick Inventions,</HI> which he somewhere calls a <HI>Mechanick Algebra</HI> for solving any Probleme in Mechanicks, as easily and cer∣tainly as any Geometrickhly <HI>Algebra,</HI> and says, that by this his method he could readily determine whether any suc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Probleme was possible, and if so, which was the nearest and easiest way of solving it.</NOTE> <HI>the Method I had made for my self for
Mechanick Inventions,</HI> quickly led me to the use of Springs instead
of Gravity for the making a Body vibrate in any Posture, where∣upon
I did first in great, and afterwards in smaller Modules, satis∣fy
my self of the Practicableness of such an Invention, and hop∣ing
to have made great advantage thereby, I acquainted divers
of my Friends, and particularly Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> that I was possest of
such an Invention, and crav'd their Assistance for improving the
use of it to my advantage.”</P>
<P>“Immediately after his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Restoration, Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> was plea∣sed
to acquaint the Lord <HI>Brouncher</HI> and Sir <HI>Robert Moray</HI> with it,
who advis'd me to get a Patent for the Invention, and propoun∣ded
very probable ways of making considerable advantage by it.
To induce them to a belief of my performance, I shew'd a Pocket-watch,
<PB N="v" REF="11"/>
accommodated with a Spring, apply'd to the Arbor of
the Ballance to regulate the motion thereof; concealing the way
I had for finding the Longitude; this was so well approv'd of,
that Sir <HI>Robert Moray</HI> drew me up the form of a Patent, the prin∣cipal
part whereof, <HI>viz.</HI> the description of the Watch, so regulat∣ed,
is his own hand Writing, which I have yet by me, the dis∣couragement
I met with in the management of this Affair, made
me desist for that time.”</P>
<P>So far this Paper. In confirmation of what is abovesaid, I met with
a Draught of an Agreement between the Lord <HI>Brouncher,</HI> Mr.
<HI>Boyle,</HI> and Sir <HI>Robert Moray,</HI> with <HI>Robert Hooke</HI> Master of Arts to
this purpose, that <HI>Robert Hooke</HI> should discover to them the whole
of his Invention to measure the parts of Time at Sea as exactly and
truly as they are at Land by the <HI>Pendulum</HI> Clocks invented by Mon∣sieur
<HI>Huygens;</HI> That of the Profits to be made thereby not exceed∣ing
6000 <HI>l. Robert Hooke</HI> was to have ¾ of whatever was made more
of it, not exceeding 4000 <HI>l. Robert Hooke</HI> was to have ⅔ of the rest,
if more could be made of it, he was to have the ½, and <HI>Robert Hooke</HI>
to be publickly owned the Author and Inventor thereof. This is
the sum of one Draught; there are indeed some others which differ
only in the division of the Profits, which it is needless here to trou∣ble
the Reader with. In pursuance of this Design there were se∣veral
Papers drawn up, <HI>viz.</HI> The Draught of an Act of Parliament to
oblige all Masters of Ships to pay so much <HI>per</HI> Tun for the use of
this Invention, as also of a Warrant to be granted by the <HI>King</HI> to
<HI>Robert Hooke, M. A.</HI> &amp;c. for a Patent for the sole use of the said In∣vention
for fourteen Years, and sign'd by His Majesty's Command,
<HI>William Morrice.</HI> I have some other Papers which are unnecessary to
be here mention'd.</P>
<P>Thus far the Matter then proceeded, and how it came to stop
here may be justly wondred; but to give the Reader the best satis∣faction
I can in this matter, I shall transcribe a Paragraph out of
the Postcript to <HI>Hooke</HI>'s Treatise of <HI>Helioscopes</HI> Printed 1676.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 27.</NOTE></P>
<P>“This Treaty with me had been finally concluded for several
Thousand Pounds, had not the inserting of one Clause broke it
off, which was, <HI>That if after I had discover'd my Invention about
the finding the Longitude by Watches (tho' in themselves sufficient) they,
or any other Person should find a way of improving my Principles he or
they should have the benefit thereof during the term of the Patent, and
not I.</HI> To which Clause I could no ways agree, knowing 'twas
easy to vary my Principles an hundred ways; and 'twas not im∣probable,
but there might be some addition of conveniency to
what I should at first discover, it being <HI>facile inventis addere;</HI> and
judging it unreasonable to be depriv'd of the benefit of my In∣ventions,
in themselves sufficient, because others might vary
them, or any other ways improve them, of which it was very
probable they would have no thought if they had not the advan∣tage
of being instructed by my Discovery, it having been hid
some Thousands of Years already; as indeed the effect hath made
evident and certain, there having been nothing done by any Bo∣dy
else upon that matter ever since.”</P>
<P>There is more in the same place worth the perusal, which, for
brevity, I omit.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="12"/>
Dr. <HI>Hooke</HI> suffering this Invention to lie undiscover'd to the last,
gave some Persons cause to question whether he was ever Possessor of
it, and to doubt whether what in Theory seem'd very promising,
wou'd answer when put to the Test of Practice; others indeed
more severely judged, that it was only a kind of boasting in him,
to assert he knew that which had not yet been perform'd, tho' at∣tempted
by many. However the matter is, it is certain he per∣sisted
in the affirmation to the last, and not many Weeks before
his Death, told me and other Persons, that he knew a certain and
infallible method to descover the true place of a Vessel at Sea, as to
its East and West distance from the Port departed from: Whether
by Watches, or other Time-keepers, or by any other ways, I know
not, tho' indeed by what is before mention'd, it should seem to be
by Watches, for the improvement of which he made many Trials,
and read several Discourses.</P>
<P>However this matter produc'd the discovery of that most useful
and practicable method of regulating Pocket-watches by a spiral
Spring, apply'd to the Arbor of the Ballance as they are now made
without any considerable addition since; the History of which, as
I have heard it from himself and find publish'd, is thus.</P>
<P>In Discourse once he told me, that about the Year 1660. he ha∣ving
shewn a Movement so regulated to the Lord <HI>Brouncher,</HI> &amp;c.
as is above related, Monsieur <HI>Huygens</HI> having for some time apply'd
himself to invent several ways to regulate Time-keepers by the cor∣respondence
he held with Mr. <HI>Oldenburgh,</HI> among other matters had
notice of this, for which there was afterwards an application made
to procure a Patent. This indeed is possible, but whether it were
so or not I cannot determine. That Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> had many Years be∣fore
(<HI>Huygens</HI> mention'd it) discover'd the Invention is certain, by
what is related in the History of the ROYAL SOCIETY among se∣veral
new Inventions, in these words, <HI>There have been invented several kinds of Pendulum Watches for the Pocket,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 247.</NOTE> <HI>wherein the motion is regulat∣ed
by Springs,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now tho' this does not mention the Springs being spiral or fa∣stened
to the Arbor of the Ballance, yet it appears it was so by
what is related above, and a Passage I have seen in a Leter from Sir
<HI>Robert Moray</HI> to Mr. <HI>Oldenburgh,</HI> dated <HI>Oxon Sept.</HI> 30. 1665. clears it,
in which are these words. “You (meaning <HI>Oldenburg</HI>) will be
the first that knows when his (that is <HI>Hugyens</HI>'s) Watches will be
ready, and I will therefore expect from you an account of them,
and if he imparts to you what he does, let me know it; to that
purpose you may ask him if he doth not <HI>apply a Spring to the Arbor
of the Ballance,</HI> and that will give him occasion to say somewhat
to you; if it be that, you may tell him what <HI>Hooke has done in
that matter, and what he intends more.</HI>” Altho' I cannot be assur'd
what <HI>Oldenburgh</HI> wrote to Monsieur <HI>Huygens,</HI> yet it is probable their
intimacy procur'd what he knew; and it is evident that <HI>Huygens</HI>'s
discovery of this was first publish'd in the <HI>Journal des Scavans,</HI> and
from thence in the Philos. Transact. for <HI>March</HI> 25th. 1675, about
ten Years after that Letter of Sir <HI>Robert Morays,</HI> and near fifteen af∣ter
<HI>Hooke</HI>'s first discovery of it.</P>
<P>To this I shall add what Mr. <HI>Oldenburgh</HI> has Printed, <HI>Philos-Transact.</HI>
N<SUP>o</SUP>. 118. “'Tis certain the describer of Helioscopes (mean∣ing
<HI>Hooke</HI>) some Years ago caus'd to be actually made some
<PB N="vii" REF="13"/>
Watches of this kind;” which (indeed he there says) were unsuccess∣ful.
Which whether so or not, I cannot learn, so many Years after,
tho' I am inclin'd to think that Expression proceeded from Passion▪
the Invention and Principle of <HI>Hooke</HI>'s and <HI>Huygens</HI>'s being both
the very same as are now us'd.</P>
<P>To this of Mr. <HI>Oldenburgh,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> made his Reply in a Post∣script
to his <HI>Lampas:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philos. Trans. N<SUP>o</SUP>. 129. p. 749.</NOTE> In rejoinder to which <HI>Oldenburg</HI> Printed a
Declaration of the Council of the ROYAL SOCIETY, to testify
his faithfulness in managing the Correspondence of the Society;
but it is observable that in this place there is no contradiction to
<HI>Hooke</HI>'s being the first in that Invention.</P>
<P>It cannot be deny'd but that Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> was frequently desir'd to
perfect his Inventions about Watches and Time-keepers, which,
when urg'd, he as often promis'd, and when any new Contrivance
was by any Person produc'd, he then shew'd something of his own,
either the same, or excelling it, a Proof he had try'd the same
before. “Particularly when on the 9<HI>th</HI> of <HI>August</HI> 1666. Mr. <HI>Mer∣cator</HI>
shew'd to the Society a Watch of his Invention, represent∣ing
the Aequation of Time to the approbation of the Company.
Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> at the same time produc'd a new piece of Watch-work
of his own Contrivance to measure Time exactly both at
Sea and Land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Journal <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> of which he was desir'd to bring in the Descrip∣tion,
which, tho' promis'd, was, as I think, never done.”</P>
<P>It must be confess'd that very many of his Inventions were ne∣ver
brought to the perfection they were capable of, nor put in
practice till some other Person either Foreigner or of our own Na∣tion
cultivated the Invention, which, when <HI>Hooke</HI> found, it put
him upon the finishing that which otherwise possibly might have
lain 'till this time in its first Defects: Whether this mistake arose
from the multiplicity of his Business which did not allow him a suf∣ficient
time, or from the fertility of his Invention which hurry'd
him on, in the quest of new Entertainments, neglecting the former
Discoveries when he was once satisfied of the feazableness and cer∣tainty
of them, tho' there wanted some small matter to render
their use more practicable and general, I know not, and whether
this was the Case in the present Subject: But this I suppose
may be an undoubted Truth, the spiral Springs were not ap∣ply'd
generally to regulate Watches, 'till after this Dispute with
<HI>Huygens.</HI></P>
<P>I have been the more particular in this matter, that I Might, as
far as I was able, assert the Invention to the true Author, and sup∣pose
I have wrong'd no Person. They that require more of this
Subject may consult the Philosophical Transactions, and <HI>Hooke</HI>'s
Tracts in the places before quoted: I have in this brought all that
relates to this Question together, that the Reader may the better
understand the whole matter, tho' thereby I have disorder'd the
series of his Life, and order of Time.</P>
<P>But to return (from this Digression, which, to make it more plain,
I have enlarg'd upon) to <HI>Oxford,</HI> I find that 1655, or 6 there were
many curious Experiments, Observations and Inquiries made, and
Instruments for those purposes contriv'd, as particularly the <HI>Barome∣ter,</HI>
of which he says, the first occasion of the Invention was a Sug∣gestion
of Sir <HI>Ch. Wren</HI> in order to find whether the Hypothesis of
<HI>Des Cartes</HI> for giving Reason of the Tides from the pressure of
<PB N="viii" REF="14"/>
the Moon upon the Air in its passage by the Meridian, were true or not.
At this time I have heard Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> say, it was first observ'd,
that the height of the <HI>Mercury</HI> in the <HI>Barometer</HI> did not conform itself
to the Moon's motion, but to that of the different Gravitation of
the Air, as has been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ince sufficiently verified. Yet in a <HI>French</HI>
Treatise Printed at <HI>Paris,</HI> several Years after this Observation at
<HI>Oxford,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Traitez de l'Equilibre de∣liquëurs,</HI> &amp;c. 1664.</NOTE> the discovery of the Gravitation of the Air is attributed to
Monsieur <HI>Pascal</HI> deduced from several Experiments, made about
the Year 1650. at <HI>Clermont</HI> in <HI>Auvergne</HI> by Monsieur <HI>Perier,</HI> at <HI>Paris</HI>
by others: And at <HI>Stockholm</HI> by Messeures <HI>Des Cartes</HI> and <HI>Chanute;</HI>
which if it be, as is there related, and the Inferences from that Ex∣periment
such as are in the same Tract mentioned, 'tis strange they
should not have been apply'd to the use of so beneficial an Instru∣ment
sooner, which I do not find it was till after this Observation
at <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>By the persuasion of Dr. <HI>Seth Ward,</HI> afterwards Bishop of <HI>Salisbu∣ry,</HI>
about 1656, he apply'd himself more particularly to the Study
of Astronomy, and about 58, or 59, he says thus, “I contriv'd se∣veral
Astronomical Instruments for making Observations both at
Sea and Land, which I afterwards produc'd before the ROYAL
SOCIETY.”</P>
<P>Some of these, I suppose, are the Instruments hereafter menti∣on'd
in his Astronomical Lectures, where I have endeavour'd to re∣trieve
as many as I could,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide p.</HI> 500. &amp;c. <HI>infra.</HI></NOTE>
partly from some rough Draughts,
partly from old Modules, and some from the verbal Descriptions
where both those helps were wanting; in which how I have suc∣ceeded,
is left to the candid Readers Judgment.</P>
<P>“Much about this time (as he says) he contriv'd the <HI>Circular Pen∣dulum,</HI>”
and the use of it for continuing the motion of another <HI>Pen∣dulum,</HI>
which he afterwards shew'd to the ROYAL SOCIETY
in 1663; about which time, and afterwards, there are several par∣ticulars
relating to the <HI>Circular Pendulum</HI> enter'd in the Journals as
his: A Movement to this purpose; is describ'd in his <HI>Animadversions</HI>
on <HI>Machina Caelestis,</HI> pag. 68. Printed 1674.</P>
<P>In the Year 1660. the most Illustrious ROYAL SOCIETY was
founded, for a full account of which, and its Institution, the Rea∣der
is referred to the Right Reverend and Learned, Dr. <HI>Sprat</HI>'s Hi∣story
thereof, Publish'd 1667. I shall only observe the Occasion
and Time when Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> was introduc'd into their Service as <HI>Cu∣rator.</HI>
Soon after the beginning of the ROYAL SOCIETY, <HI>viz.</HI>
about <HI>April</HI> 1661. a Debate arose in the Society, occasion'd by a
small Tract Printed in 1660. about the cause of the rising of Water
in slender Glass Pipes, higher than in larger, and that in a certain
proportion to their Bores; this Discourse was wrote and Publish'd
by <HI>Hooke;</HI> the Explication of which diffcult <HI>Phaenomenon</HI> made him
the more regarded. The sum of his Reasonings upon this Subject
he Publish'd afterward, <HI>Micrography Observ.</HI> the 6th. in which there
are several very curious and then new Remarks and Hints; as to
the Nature of Fluidity and Gravity, which last is farther prosecut∣ed
in his Treatise of Springs, with other excellent Subjects, to which
the Inquisitive are referr'd for a more ample satisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="15"/>
This, together with his former Performances, made him much
respected by the <HI>R. Society,</HI> and on the fifth of <HI>November 1662. “</HI> Sir
<HI>Robert Moray</HI> propos'd a Person that was willing to be entertain'd
as a <HI>Curator</HI> by the <HI>Society,</HI> offering to furnish them every day
when they met, with three or four considerable Experiments;
which Proposition was unanimously receiv'd, Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> being
nam'd to be the Person; and accordingly the next Day of their
meeting on the twelfth of <HI>November</HI> he was unanimously accep∣ted
and taken as <HI>Curator,</HI> with the Thanks of the <HI>Society</HI> order'd
to Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> for dispensing with him for their use, and order'd
that Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> should come and sit among them, and both bring
in every Day three or four of his own Experiments, and take care
of such others as should be recommended to him by the <HI>So∣ciety.</HI>”</P>
<P>From this time the <HI>Societies</HI> Journals gave sufficient Testimoni∣als
of his Performances, all which would be too many to particu∣larize
here, therefore I shall only touch upon some of the chief, as
the Experiment of breaking Glass-Bubbles inward, the Air con∣tain'd
in them being rarify'd by heat in their blowing, and so her∣metically
sealing them whilst hot; which Bubbles were observ'd at
a certain degree of Tension, both in the distending them whilst
blowing, and in their contracting as they cool'd, to yield a smart
sound, several of these in cooling would break inwards with a
brisk noise, tho' others broak without any noise, upon which the
Experimenter made several Remarks.</P>
<P>Many Experiments were made to explicate the Nature and Qua∣lity
of the Air, <HI>viz.</HI> as to its Gravitation, its different Effects when
Rarify'd, Condens'd and Natural, with its use as to the Life of A∣nimals,
and maintaining a lucid Flame, or cause the Dissolution of
Bodies by Fire, a live Animal and Lamp being inclosed together in
a Receiver, shew'd the <HI>Pabulum vitae</HI> and <HI>slammae</HI> to be much the same:
At which time also he try'd how long the same Air would serve
for breathing. This leads me to remember that noble Experiment
made by him of keeping a Dog alive, his <HI>Thorax</HI> being laid open,
by blowing fresh Air into his Lungs, of which a particular Account
is given in the History of the ROYAL SOCIETY, pag. 232. which plainly
shews the use of the Air, and difference between ve∣nal
and arterial Blood.</P>
<P>He shew'd what addition of weight is given to Fluids, by a∣scending
and descending Bodies in them. The different Specifick
weight of Hot and Cold Water, with the uses to be made thereof
in heating large quantities of Water. Of the difference of Ice and
Water, with the Refraction of other Fluids, by an Instrument de∣scrib'd
in the Preface to his Micrography.</P>
<P>Experiments and a Contrivance to shew the Force and Velocity
of Bodies falling from several heights, weighing Bodies at several
heights. <HI>Pendulums</HI> of two hundred Foot long. The difference of
the <HI>Barometer</HI> at several heights. Experiments to improve Land
Carriage. Methods of conveying secret and quick Intelligence.</P>
<P>Instruments to measure time exactly. To observe a second Mi∣nute
by the Sun or Stars. To try the strength of Gun-power, and
several others, particularly an Engine to cut down the Teeth of
Watch Wheels more exactly than can be done by the most expert
Hand, an Invention now of constant use.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="16"/>
About this time he fix'd the Standard for the <HI>Thermometer</HI> from the
Point of Freezing; and contriv'd a way to make the motions of the
<HI>Barometer</HI> more sensible, which is since with farther Improvements,
Publish'd in the <HI>Philosoph. Transact.</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP>. 185. p. 241.</P>
<P>In <HI>Feb.</HI> 1663-64. he contriv'd a way to supply fresh Air to the U∣rinator
under the Diving Bell by a Chain of Buckets and a Leaden
Box for his Head, when he went out of the Bell to be supply'd with
fresh Air from the Bell, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>At this time he shew'd Experiments of the dilating of Glass and
other Bodies by Heat.</P>
<P>In <HI>July</HI> 1664. he produc'd an Experement to shew the number of
Vibrations of an extended String, made in a determinate time, re∣quisite
to give a certain Tone or Note, by which it was found that
a Wire making two hundred seventy two vibrations in one Second
of Time, sounded <HI>G Sol Re Vt</HI> in the Scale of all Musick. Other
Experiments were made of the division of a Monochord, which I omit.</P>
<P>About this time many Experiments were made of the Velocity
of Bodies sinking and rising in Water,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Philos. Trans. N<SUP>o</SUP>.</HI> 9. <HI>p.</HI> 147. <HI>&amp; N<SUP>o</SUP>. 24. p.</HI> 439.</NOTE> in order to ascertain that
Contrivance, which was after made publick, of sounding the Seas
depth with the sounding Ball, which is too well known to insist
on it.</P>
<P>At several Meetings of the <HI>Society</HI> in 1663, and 4. he produc'd his
Microscopial Observations, and read the Explications and Discourses
made upon them, which were after publish'd in his <HI>Micrographia,</HI>
at the beginning of the Year 1665. In which Book, I suppose, it
will hardly be deny'd, that there are more excellent Philosophical
Discoveries and Hints, that in most extant of its bulk: The Book
itself being well known, I shall only observe that there are describ'd in it
several sorts of Microscopes, with the ways of using them.
The Baroscope, Hygroscope, an Instrument to graduate Thermo∣meters,
an Engine to grind Optick-glasses, an Instrument to mea∣sure
the Refraction of Liquors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I remember Mr. <HI>Marshal</HI> when he
desir'd the <HI>Societies</HI> Approbation of his new Method of grinding
Spectacles and other Optick-glasses, own'd he had the first intima∣tion
of it from a hint of Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI>'s in this Book about the Polish∣ing
many very small Microscope Object-glasses at once.</P>
<P>A more particular Account of this Book is extant in the <HI>Philosoph.
Transact.</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 2. p. 29. and to shew the Esteem Foreigners had of
it, I shall refer the Reader to the account given of it in the <HI>Journal
des Scavans</HI> for the Month of <HI>December</HI> 1666. In this the Journalist
speaks with great Respect of the Author, and Esteem for the Work
itself, observing the vast number of curious Remarks made there∣in
concerning the improvement of the other Senses, as well as that
of seeing: Observations of Colours and Light, the Moon, Stars, Re∣flexion,
Inflection, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> concluding after (having mention'd several)
that the Book contains more than can be taken notice of in an Ex∣tract.</P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>June</HI> 1664. Sir <HI>John Cutler</HI> having intimated
his Design to some Members of the <HI>Society</HI> of founding a Mecha∣nick
Lecture, with a Yearly Gratuity of fifty Pounds, on the twenty
second of the same Month several Members met to confer about
the manner of setling that Lecture, and on the ninth of <HI>Novem∣ber</HI>
following, it is enter'd in the Journals to this purpose; “Sir
<PB N="xi" REF="17"/>
<HI>John Cutler</HI> having founded a Lecture, and settl'd an Annual Sti∣pend
upon <HI>Robert Hooke,</HI> M. A. of fifty Pounds during Life (en∣trusting'
the President, Council and Fellows of the said <HI>Society</HI> to
direct and appoint the said Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> as to the Subject and Number
of his Lectures) the <HI>Society</HI> order'd several of their Members to
wait upon Sir <HI>John Cutler,</HI> with their Thanks for his particular
Favour to a worthy Member, and for that Respect and Confidence
he hath hereby exprest towards their whole Body, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>”</P>
<P>“On the twenty seventh of <HI>June</HI> 1664. it was voted that at the
first Opportunity Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> should be put to the Scrutiny for
the <HI>Curators</HI> place by Office; on the twenty third of <HI>November</HI>
following he was propos'd as a <HI>Setled Curator</HI> of Experiments;
and on the eleventh of <HI>Jan.</HI> 1664. elected and made <HI>Curator by Of∣fice</HI>
for Life, with an additional Salary to Sir <HI>John Cutler</HI>'s Annu∣ity.”</P>
<P>At this time he read several Astronomical Lectures, some of
which are publish'd in this Volume, and invented many Instru∣ments,
particularly his Quadrant with a Roler on the Limb; an
Instrument to measure the Velocity of the Wind, and repeated
the Experiment of the Vibrations of a Pendule two hundred
Foot long. The first proposal for the Weather-Clock was then of∣fer'd
upon the Description of one made by Sir <HI>Christopher Wren.</HI>
The Experiment was made and account given of the suspension of
the Mercury to seventy five Inches in the Tube, which, with some
additions, is Printed in this Volume. From this time he brought
in almost at every Meeting Experiments, Observations, Schemes of new Instruments and Inventions, or something considerable to
the advancement of Knowledge, and very frequently read his <HI>Cut∣lerian</HI>
Lectures, of many whereof he publish'd, the most material
parts in his Tracts Printed at different times, in Quarto, call'd
<HI>Lectures and Collections,</HI> &amp;c. comprizing compendiously in one con∣tinu'd
Discourse, the chief Matters and Subjects handled in several Lectures.</P>
<P>Thus the generous Ardor with which the ROYAL SOCIETY
was inspir'd, continu'd 'till the Year 1665. when, by reason of the
great Mortaity then reigning, they were oblig'd to desist and break
up their Weekly Meetings till the fourteenth of <HI>March</HI> 1665-66. when, upon
Summons, they met again. In this Interim the Members retir'd to several Places in the Country, and Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> attend∣ed
Dr. <HI>Wilkins,</HI> and some other ingenious Gentlemen into <HI>Sur∣ry,</HI>
near <HI>Banstead Downs,</HI> where several Experiments were made
during this Recess, an account of which was after brought into
the <HI>Society.</HI></P>
<P>At some of the first Meetings, after they came together again,
“Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> produc'd a very small Quadrant for observing accu∣rately
to Minutes and Seconds, it had an Arm moving on it by
means of a Screw lying on the Limb of the Quadrant;” this is
all the account I find of it. Possibly this was the first ever made
after that manner, tho' it is now sufficiently known and practis'd:
A large one of this sort, and of all its parts, with the rest of the
<HI>apparatus</HI> and manner of using it, is at large publish'd by the In∣ventor,
<HI>Anno</HI> 1674. in his Animadversions on <HI>Hevelius</HI>'s <HI>Machina
Caelestis,</HI> pag. 54. in which Book also several other ingenious Con∣trivances,
Instruments and Inventions are mention'd.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="18"/>
“<HI>May</HI> 23d. 1666.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Journal R. S.</NOTE> There was read a Paper of Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI>'s ex∣plicating
the Inflexion of a direct motion into a Curve, by a su∣pervening,
attractive Principle, which was order'd to be Regi∣ster'd.
The Discourse contain'd therein is an Introduction to an
Experiment to shew that Circular Motion, is compounded of an
indeavour by a direct motion by the Tangent, and of another in∣deavour
tending to the Center: To which purpose there was a
<HI>Pendulum</HI> fastended to the Roof of the Room with a large wooden
Ball of <HI>Lignum Vitae</HI> on the end of it; and it was found, that if
the <HI>Impetus</HI> of the indeavour by the Tangent, at the first setting
out, was stronger than the indeavour to the Center, there was
generated such an Elliptical Motion, whose longest Diameter was
parallel to the direct indeavour of the Body at the first Impulse:
But if that <HI>Impetus</HI> were weaker than that indeavour to the Cen∣ter,
there was generated such an Elliptical Motion, whose shor∣ter
Diameter was parallel to the direct indeavour of the Body in
the first point of the Impulse; if both were equal there was made
a perfect Circular Motion. There was also made another Expe∣riment,
by fastening another Pendulous Body by a short String
on the lower part of the Wire, by which the greater weight was
suspended, that it might freely make a Circular or Elliptical Mo∣tion
round the bigger, whilst the bigger mov'd Circularly of El∣liptically
about the first Center. The intention whereof was to
explicate the manner of the Moons motion about the Earth, it
appearing evidently thereby, that neither the bigger Ball, which
represented the Earth, nor the less which represented the Moon,
were mov'd in so perfect a Circle of Ellipsis, as otherwise they
would have been, if either of them had been suspended and
mov'd singly: But that a certain Point which seem'd to be the
Center of Gravity of the two Bodies (howsoever posited and
consider'd as one) seem'd to be regularly mov'd, in such a Circle
or Ellipsis, the two Balls having other perculiar motions in small
Epicicles about the said Point.”</P>
<P>“<HI>Aug.</HI> 1st. 1666. he read his Observations of the Comet in 1664.
after Printed among his Tracts, and call'd <HI>Cometa.</HI> The same
produc'd a certain Contrivance to shew that the Circular Pendu∣lum
was made of two strait Lines crossing each other, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>” and
about the same time his Instrument to take the distance of the
Stars from the Moon, the one Object seen direct, the other by
Reflexion, this is publish'd in his Book, pag. 503.</P>
<P>The dreadful Conflagration of a great part of the City of <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
happening in the beginning of <HI>September</HI> 1666. brought an∣other
great hindrance to the <HI>Societies</HI> Proceeding; so that they
were oblig'd to remove their usual place of Meeting from <HI>Gresham
College</HI> to <HI>Arundel</HI> House in the <HI>Strand,</HI> where, by the favour of the
then Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> they prosecuted their former Inquiries, their
first Meeting at <HI>Arundel</HI> House being on the ninth of <HI>Jan.</HI> 1666-67.</P>
<P>“On the nineteenth of <HI>Sep.</HI> 1666. he pruduc'd a Module he had
design'd for the Rebuilding of the City, with which the <HI>Society</HI> were very well pleas'd, and Sir <HI>John Laurence</HI> the then late <HI>Lord
Major,</HI> address'd himself to the <HI>Society,</HI> expressing the present <HI>Lord
Majors and Aldermens</HI> liking thereof, as also their desire that it might
be shewn to this <HI>Majesty,</HI> they preferring it far before the Model drawn up by the City Surveyor.”</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="19"/>
What this Model was, I cannot so well determine, but I have
heard that it was defign'd in it to have all the chief Streets as
from <HI>Leaden-Hall</HI> corner to <HI>Newgate,</HI> and the like, to lie in an exact
strait Line, and all the other cross Streets turning out of them at
right Angles, all the Churches, publick Buildings, Market-places,
and the like, in proper and convenient places, which, no doubt,
would have added much to the Beauty and Symmetry of the whole.
How this came not to be accepted of I know not, but it is proba∣ble
this might contribute not a little to his being taken notice off
by the Magistrates of the City, and soon after made Surveyor.</P>
<P>The Rebuilding of the City, according to the Act of Parlia∣ment,

Proprietors, Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> was pitch'd upon, and appointed <HI>City-Surveyor</HI>
for that difficult Work, which being very great, took up
a large proportion of his Time, to the no small hindrance of his
Philosophical Disquisitions.</P>
<P>In this Employment he got the most part of that Estate he died
possessed of, as was evident by a large Iron Chest of Money found
after his Death, which had been lock'd down with the Key in it,
with a date of the Time, by which it appear'd to have been so
shut up for above thirty Years: In this was contain'd the greatest
part of what he left behind him, which was to the value of ma∣ny
thousands in Gold and Silver. That he might by this place
justly acquire a considerable Estate, I think cannot be deny'd, eve∣ry
particular Person after the Fire being in haste to have his con∣cerns
expedited; so that as I have been inform'd he had no Rest
early and late from Persons soliciting to have their Grounds set out,
which, without any Fraud or Injustice, deserv'd a due recompence
in so fatiguing an Employ.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 31. 1666. He shew'd his inclineing <HI>Pendulum,</HI> with the u∣ses
thereof, to regulate the motions of a Clock as exactly as a long
one.</P>
<P>On the 9th of <HI>Jan.</HI> 1666/7. he was order'd to prosecute his Obser∣vations
of the Earth's <HI>Paralax</HI> formerly by him propos'd: A large
Account of the Result of his Observations therein were after Printed
in his <HI>Attempt to prove the motion of the Earth</HI> 1674, being the first
of his <HI>Cutlerian</HI> Lectures Publish'd.</P>
<P>On the 6th of <HI>Feb.</HI> following, he produc'd his new <HI>Lamp</HI> con∣triv'd
so as to supply the Oil in equal quantity as it wastes, that it
may never rise too much or too little, the farther Description and
Explication of which, with many curious Remarks, were Publish<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
1677. and intitl'd <HI>Lampas,</HI> or <HI>Descriptions of some Improvements of
Lamps and Water-poises,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Feb.</HI> the 28th. He first produc'd his <HI>Reflecting Telescope,</HI> which is
describ'd with the Reason of the Principle, with some other In∣struments
in his Treatise of <HI>Helioscopes,</HI> Printed 1676.</P>
<P>On the 17th of <HI>June</HI> 1667. and afterwards he read large Dis∣courses
of the Causes, Powers and Effects of <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> affirm∣ing
the great Hills and Mountains in the World to have been raised
by them, of which Subject he at several times afterwards made
very many Discourses and Lectures, the most part of which are col∣lected
together in this Volume, beginning at Page 279.</P>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="20"/>
In <HI>July</HI> 1667. he try'd several Experiments upon himself in an
<HI>exhausted Receiver,</HI> big enough to contain a Man, I think the only
Experiment of that kind ever try'd.</P>
<P>At this time he contriv'd a <HI>Micrometer</HI> of less Charge and Diffi∣culy
than that invented by Mr. <HI>Gascoin</HI> with Screws; this, I sup∣pose,
is Publish'd in this Volume, Page 498.</P>
<P><HI>Dec.</HI> 26. 1667. He brought in a farther Description of a <HI>Sea Ba∣rometer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jan.</HI> the 16th 1667-68. he produc'd “his new Contrivance of promot∣ing
the Vibrations of Pendules, so as to prevent all Checks, which
he affirmed had not been provided against by any Contrivance to
that time.”</P>
<P><HI>Apr.</HI> 9. 1668. He produc'd two Instruments to promote the sense
of Hearing.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> the 14th He shew'd an Experiment of the penetration of Li∣quors
in Oil of Vitriol and fair Water.</P>
<P>About this time he produc'd many other Experiments and In∣ventions,
which I omit, and shall only observe, that there being
several Discourses about the measuring a of Degree <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Earth,
he propos'd divers Methods of performing it, and invented
several Instruments; and as is enter'd in the Journal, <HI>Oct.</HI> 28. 1669.
Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> was of Opinion, <HI>That one of the exactest ways of
measuring, was by making accurate Observations of the Heavens to a se∣cond,
by a Perpendicular Tube, and then to take exact distances by Angels to
a second also,</HI> which I take to be the Method observ'd by the <HI>French</HI>
not long after, as may be seen by a particular Treatise of it Pub∣lish'd
by Monsieur <HI>Picart,</HI> as likewise by what <HI>Du hamel</HI> says in his
History of that Society, p. 98. to which the curious are refer'd. I
find also by some Notices and loose Papers of our Curator, that he
invented a sort of travelling Calesh for this purpose, which should
describe upon a Paper, not only the Mensuration of the way gone
over, but the several Ascents and Descents, together with the turn∣ings
and windings of the Calesh, or the Points of the Compass
upon which the Person travell'd with other Contrivances, which I
know not by what misfortune, were never put in practise. There
were also other Methods for measuring a Degree propos'd to be
made in St. <HI>James</HI>'s Park on the Canal, which also had the like fate
of not being prosecuted.</P>
<P>In <HI>Jan</HI> 1669-70. He first propos'd a drop of Mercury <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an univer∣sal
Standard, which is more at large describ'd, Page 472. of the fol∣lowing
Volume. And in <HI>April</HI> shew'd an Experiment with a so∣lution
of Copper to represent the appearance of Clouds and other
aerial Meteors, by dropping into it several Salts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and at the
same time shew'd the use of introducing the Species into a dark
Room for Painting, and contriv'd a Box for that purpose, which is
here Printed.</P>
<P>In <HI>March</HI> 1671. “he shew'd several Experiments to explain the
Nature and Cause of <HI>Gravity:</HI> Particularly on the 9th an Ex∣periment
was made, in which some Flower put into a void shal∣low
Glass with a large sloping brim, and a pretty tall Foot was
made to rise and run over like a fluid, by the knocking on the
edge of the Glass, and also by the forceably moving of ones Fin∣ger
round the edge to the same. Leaden Bullets also being put
into this Glass, did, by knocking, move it like a fluid.—This
<PB N="xv" REF="21"/>
was propos'd to consider what might be the cause of Gravity,
and suggest an Hypothesis to explicate the motion of Gravity
by, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>”</P>
<P>These, and several other Experiments, he shew'd to explain Na∣tural
Bodies and Actions, in some of which I have been the more
particular out of a hope these hints may excite some inquisitive Per∣son
to proceed farther in such Inquiries.</P>
<P>This same Year several Discourses and Papers past between the
Learned Mr.<HI>Newton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> concerning a new Theory of
Light and Colours, which being now so generally known, I shall
not farther insist on.</P>
<P>About this time he made a Proposition for perfecting all sorts of
Optick-glasses, the secret of which was deliver'd in an Anagram to
the President my Lord <HI>Brouncher.</HI></P>
<P>Not long after this time began that unhappy Dispute between
Monsieur <HI>Hevelius</HI> and <HI>Hooke</HI> concerning the preference of Plain and
Telescopical Sights for Astronomical Instruments,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Dispute with</HI> Hevelius.</NOTE> which, as I can
collect, was thus occasion'd. Mr. <HI>Hooke,</HI> by means of Mr. <HI>Olden∣burgh,</HI>
had recommended to Monsieur <HI>Hevelius</HI> the Application of
Telescopick Sights to his exquisitely contriv'd and elobrated Instru∣ments,
affirming that by them an Angle might be taken to a much greater
niceness than with plain Sights, and gave them a short, but
as he thought a sufficient information of the manner of applying
them to the Instrument, and intimated that if any thing requir'd a
farther Explication, he was ready to give it. Nevertheless <HI>Heve∣lius</HI>
could not be prevail'd with to make use of them, whether he
thought himself too experienc'd to be inform'd by a young Astro∣nomer,
as he reckon'd <HI>Hooke,</HI> or whether having made so many Ob∣servations
with plain Sights, he was unwilling to alter his Method
least he might bring their exactness into Question, or whether being
by long practice accustom'd to the use of them, and not thoroughly
apprehending the use of the other, nor well understanding the dif∣ference,
as Mr. <HI>Molineux</HI> has observ'd in his Opticks, is indeed un∣certain.</P>
<P>Not long after came out his curious and pompous Book of the
first part of his <HI>Machina Caelestis;</HI> and <HI>Hooke</HI> took occasion in his <HI>Cut∣lerian
Lectures,</HI> to read several Discourses upon that Book, and the
Instruments therein describ'd, which were Printed <HI>Anno</HI> 1674. un∣der
the Title of <HI>Animadversions upon Hevelius</HI>'s <HI>Machina Caelestis.</HI></P>
<P>In which Treatise vindicating somewhat warmely the benefit of
Telescopick Sights and their preference, he chanc'd to let slip some
Expressions, which, tho' possibly strictly true, could yet never
be digested by <HI>Hevelim.</HI></P>
<P>Several Years after <HI>Hevelius</HI> Publish'd his <HI>Annus Climactericus,</HI>
which again reviv'd the Dispute, and caus'd several Learned Men
to interest themselves in the Controversy. This, I think, is the
true History of the Matter. I shall here subjoin what <HI>Hooke</HI> wrote
himself in Answer to what some Persons thought fit to write upon
this Subject, as I found them drawn up by himself in a Paper or
two among his Manuscripts; for the better understanding of which,
I shall observe, First, That <HI>Hevelius</HI> having sent his <HI>Annus Climacteri∣cus</HI>
to the ROYAL SOCIETY, Dr. <HI>Wallis</HI> was desir'd to give an
account of it, which is Printed in the <HI>Philosophical Transactions</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP>.
175. p. 1162, in which the Dr. having used some Expressions which
<PB N="xvi" REF="22"/>
<HI>Hooke,</HI> thought reflected too severely upon him; and Mr. <HI>Moli∣neux</HI>
not long after sending a Letter to the same purpose, he wrote
his own Vindication almost verbatim, as I have here Printed it, at
least nothing material is omitted or added.</P>
<P>“There having been lately read in a Meeting of this Honour∣able
<HI>Society</HI> a Letter from Mr. <HI>Molineux</HI> containing several Re∣flections
that concern'd me, which, without some satisfactory an∣swer;
must needs make me suffer in the Opinion of those who
have not truly understood the Matter in Controversy, and the
high Esteem I have of the Justice and Judgment of this Illustri∣ous
Company, persuades me the rather to make my Defence here.”</P>
<Q>“The Objections in the Letter were these.”</Q>
<P>“That if it be true which has been asserted, not only by some
celebrated Astronomers, but chiefly by Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> in his <HI>Animad∣versions,</HI>
&amp;c. the Indeavours of <HI>Hevelius</HI> will be frustrated and his
vast Charges to no more purpose than <HI>Ticho</HI>'s and all his splendid
<HI>apparatus</HI> but meer Lumber; for upon this Question as to plain
Sights, the price of his Astronomical Labours of his whole Life
depends; but surely this were an Event highly deplorable, not
only to the party himself immediately concern'd, but the whole
<HI>Respublica Literaria.</HI>”</P>
<P>Secondly, Mention is made of the slightness and smallness of
“what I had publish'd, which was only a Pamphlet, that asserted,
that notwithstanding all this, yet meerly for want of Telescopick
Sights and some new kind of invented Divisions on Mr. <HI>Hevelius</HI>'s
Instruments, I went so far as to doubt whether his Observations
could be true, and always the same to two or three Minutes, and
that the whole import of it besides this, was nothing but the De∣scription
of an Instrument which he never heard was put in practice.”</P>
<P>“The Third Objection against me is that, tho' Monsieur <HI>Heve∣lius</HI>
had earnestly requested from me, or any one else that had Te∣lescopick
Instruments, to send him some distances of fixt Stars
observ'd by them, yet he could never be so happy as to obtain a∣ny
from me, tho' afterwards he did from some others, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>”</P>
<P>“These, and some other Discourses, spread abroad tacitely insi∣nuate,
that the Publishing those <HI>Animadversions</HI> was a very ill
Action, and that the Learned in general have receiv'd a great pre∣judice
thereby, it concerns me therefore to clear my self of this
Imputation: For Answer then I say,”</P>
<P>“First, If what I have Publish'd in those <HI>Animadversions</HI> be true
and certain, then I desire to know whether it were better for the
<HI>Respublica Literaria</HI> to be acquainted with it, or to remain possest
with the belief of some Assertions of Monsieur <HI>Hevelius,</HI> which
are really Mistakes (not to say worse) tho' possibly till that time,
wherein I publish'd them, they were generally believ'd to be Truths,
as he has taken a great deal of pains to induce a belief of, in the first
part of his <HI>Machina Caelestis,</HI> from Page 293, to Page 300, which I
<PB N="xvii" REF="23"/>
the rather mention, because some Persons have thought and as∣serted,
that I was the first Aggressor in Print, the contrary of
which those six Pages evince.”</P>
<P>Secondly, “Whether those deplorable Events of lessening the
price of Monsieur <HI>Hevelius</HI>'s Works, if that were true, when
put into the Ballance, will out-weigh the detecting a Mistake, or
discovery of a Truth in a matter of so great Moment in Natu∣ral
Philosophy, as concerns the most considerable parts of Know∣ledge
in the Theory of the Universe, especially of Celestial Bo∣dies;
for if Truth be that which is most prevalent with all Phi∣losophical
Spirits against any particular Interest, then I hope I shall
prove I have not offended in that particular in my publication of
those <HI>Animadversions.</HI> And <HI>Hevelius</HI> himself was of the same
Mind, when at the sixty first Page of his Preface he writes
(speaking of his disparaging some things of <HI>Ticho Brahe) in hoc ne∣gotio
semper in cujusuis animo haerere debet. Amicus Plato, Amicus
Aristoteles, sed magis tamen amica veritas.</HI> Nor do I find him so
shy in proclaiming the Mistakes of <HI>Ticho</HI>'s Observations, when it
made for his own Reputation; for in the thirty fourth Page of his
Preface he says, that the greatest part of <HI>Ticho</HI>'s Observations dif∣fer'd
from his own four, five, six, and even ten Min. At the
thirty ninth Page he says, That of 780 in <HI>Ticho</HI>'s Catalogue there
are but 260 which differ, not less than two Minutes; but all the
rest differ 3#. 5#. 10#. 20#. 30#. 40#. 45#. 50#. nay a whole Degree from
the truth, and that fifteen differ above a Degree, and some many
more, even to eight Degrees in Longitude, and in Latitude to
thirteen whole Degrees, sometimes in defect, sometimes in ex∣cess,
yet for all this <HI>Hevelius</HI> would be thought highly to value
<HI>Ticho Brahe,</HI> and not to have made any Reflections upon him.”</P>
<P>“Nor has the detecting Mistakes even in Persons of as great
Fame been look'd upon so ill a thing, but rather a meritorious
Action, as might be instanc'd in Dr. <HI>Pell</HI>'s short Answer in a ¼ of
a Sheet of Paper to <HI>Longomontanus</HI> his Work, which had been the
business of thirty Years. Another instance may be of <HI>Phocilides</HI>
upon <HI>Lansbergius,</HI> the learned <HI>Savilian Astronomick Professor</HI> against
<HI>Bulialdus,</HI> &amp;c. all which Authors were well esteem'd for their de∣tecting
Mistakes, and discovering Truth. And as for any disre∣spectful
or undervaluing Sentiments I had of <HI>Hevelius</HI> or his Per∣formances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 43, &amp; 44.</NOTE>
I hope what I have printed in my <HI>Admadversions</HI> will
prevail with the unprejudiced to believe the contrary; where I
say, <HI>That I would not be understood by these Animadversions to under∣value
the Works and Performances of a Person so highly meriting the
Thanks of the Learned World for his great Expence and vast Pains, in
performing a Work so highly useful to Astronomy and Navigation, that
I did not in the least doubt but that it would be a Work of perpetual
Esteem, and much preferrable to any thing of the like kind yet done in the
World; and that he had gone as far as was possible for humane Industry
to go with Instruments of that kind, which were as compleat and exact
as Instruments with plain Sights could be made; and that he had calcu∣lated
with all imaginable care and skill, and deliver'd them with the like
Candor and Integrity: But yet that it was my Opinion, that this ought
not to discourage others from making use of Telescope-sights, and to make
better Observations with Instruments by that means more exact.</HI>”</P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="24"/>
“This I hope may Apologize for my writing those <HI>Animadversions.</HI>”
“But in the next place I must make some defence for what is
said in them. This Gentleman says I went so far as to doubt
whether <HI>Hevelius</HI>'s Observations could be made true and always
the same to two or three Minutes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Animadversi∣ons,</HI> Pag. 7.</NOTE> I wish the place had been quo∣ted
where I said so, since I only said that I believ'd it impossible
for any one to distinguish with common Sights any distance in
the Heavens to less than half a Minute, and very few to a Mi∣nute,
and I am apt to believe there may be some instances even
in <HI>Hevelius</HI>'s Catalogue that will verify this Assertion.”</P>
<P>“And for any other Assertion, which is <HI>really mine</HI> in that Trea∣tise,
I do not doubt of satisfying any unprejudiced Person by ex∣periment,
if desir'd, which I say, is <HI>really my Assertion;</HI> for by
mistake or otherwise, some things have been fathered upon me
I never said, <HI>viz.</HI> that I should assert, <HI>That an Instrument of a span
Radius might be made, that should perform Observations sixty times more
accurate than could be done with his best Instruments:</HI> Which Asser∣tion
is none of mine, and whoever have spread these Falsities,
might have found better Employment. I say indeed, that a very
small Instrument, curiously made, exactly divided and instructed
with Telescope-Sights will perform much better in all Observa∣tions
(except of the Sun) than the largest Instrument without
such Sights, for the reason before alledged from the defect in our
Eyes which cannot distinguish an Angle less than half a Minute,
nor is this a defect in my own Eyes only (as <HI>Hevelius</HI> somewhere seems
to hint) for the Experiment may easily be try'd with the best Eyes.”</P>
<P>“Nor is it any disparagement to <HI>Hevelius</HI>'s Observations to com∣pare
them with <HI>Ticho Brahe</HI>'s, tho' I should have suppos'd them
but of equal value, since the mere repeating of his Observations
would be of great use in Astronomy, these being almost one hun∣dred
Years after his; for we must by such comparisons judge
of many considerable inquiries concerning Celestial Bodies, which
cannot by other means be so well detected, for which I refer to
the seventy sixth Page of my <HI>Animadversions,</HI> viz. to know whe∣ther
those Celestial Bodies which are suppos'd so fixt, do not vary
their Positions to each other, and also their Magnitudes, which I
had good grounds to believe.”</P>
<P>“As to the Objection that my Pamphlet contain'd <HI>little besides the
Description of an Instrument never put in practice.</HI> I conceive there
may be several Mistakes; for I am of Opinion, upon perusal there
will be somewhat else in that Treatise worth consideration. Next
that there has been Instruments made, perfected and used after
that way, by Sir <HI>Jonas More,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Gregory</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by Mr.
<HI>Halley,</HI> and many others, and I believe very few Astronomical In∣struments
since have been made with plain Sights; and if the multiude of Authorities were necessary, I could produce <HI>Auzout,
Picart, Mariot, Romer, De la Hire, Montanari, Gotignies,</HI> and o∣thers,
not to name those of our own Nation.”</P>
<P>“As to my not returning the Observations of certain distances
of Stars, which <HI>Hevelius</HI> desir'd, 'tis sufficiently known what in∣conveniences
we lay under in this place after the Fire of <HI>London,</HI>
and had I found conveniences, yet the unkind Reception those
things found, which I sent him, was enough to deter me from
such a Compliance; tho' he was sensible how I had often been rea∣dy
<PB N="xix" REF="25"/>
to gratify his Curiosity in many other particulars. But when
his <HI>Machina Caelestis</HI> was publish'd, I was oblig'd to write those <HI>A∣nimadversions,</HI>
in which I hope all unprejudic'd Readers will justify
my proceedure, at least I am ready to prove any thing I have
therein asserted.”</P>
<P>I have been the larger in the Account of this Controversy that
the intelligent Reader may make the better judgment thereof, it being
the most considerable he ever had with any Person, and shall
wave the giving my Opinion of it.</P>
<P>In 1674. he shew'd an Engine or Instrument to perform any A∣rithmetical
Operation, but the more particular account of this and
other Instruments not describ'd in this Volume, I shall reserve for
another opportunity.</P>
<P>About the latter end of the same Year the ROYAL SOCIETY
kept their Weekly Meeting at <HI>Gresham College</HI> again, and on the fif∣teenth
of <HI>Jan.</HI> following he shew'd a way to determine how small
an Angle the unassisted Eye is able to discern, by which it was found,
that none of the Persons Eyes present could observe a much less An∣gle
than of a Minute; for a more ample account of which the Rea∣der
is referr'd to the eighth Page of his <HI>Animadversions.</HI></P>
<P>From this time many Magnetical Experiments were made by
him, and on the nineteenth of <HI>March</HI> he propos'd a Theory of the
variation, the substance of which was this, “That the Magnet hath its peculiar Poles distant ten Degrees from the Poles of the
Earth, about which they move so as to make a Revolution in
three hundred and seventy Years, whence the variation hath al∣tered
of late about ten or eleven Minutes every Year, and will
probably continue so to do for some time, till it begins to grow
slower and slower, and will at length be Stationary and Retro∣grade,
and in probability may return; but whether it will be so or
not Time must shew. At the same time he propos'd the making
of a very easy and nice Instrument to observe the variation of the
variations of the Needle in different parts of the World.”</P>
<P>What this Instrument was is not easy now to be determin'd, but
the Reader will find the Figure of an Instrument something to this
purpose at Page 486.</P>
<P>On the 4th of <HI>Feb.</HI> 1674-75. several Observations and Discourses
having been made about the Structure of the Muscles of Animals,
Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> said, “That his Observation was, that the fleshy part of
a Muscle consisted of an infinite number of exceeding small round
Pipes, extended between the two tendons of the Muscles, and
seem'd to end in them. Which Tendons, in the Muscles of Beef
boyl'd would be easily stript off from those Pipes, and so leave the
round ends of those Pipes very distinct and visible: He said that
the reason of the moving of a Muscle might be from the filling
or emptying of those Pipes, whose sides seem'd to be flexible like
those of a Gut. He intimated also, that he knew a way of mak∣ing
succedaneous Muscles for a Man to supply the defect of his
Muscles for flying, and give one Man the strength of ten or
twenty, if required.”</P>
<P>“<HI>March</HI> the 18th 1674-75. he made an Experiment of a new proper∣ty
of Light, having before read some Discourses upon that Sub∣ject.”
This Experiment is to be seen Page 186 of this Book, to
which the Reader is referr'd for a more full account.</P>

Mr. <HI>Oldenburgh,</HI> the then Secretary, dying in the time of the So∣cieties
Recess, 1677. Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> was desir'd to take his place, and
take the Minutes of what considerable Matters past, which he did
on the twenty fifth of <HI>October</HI> 1677. and the same day produc'd his
Water-poise and shew'd the nicety thereof. The Description of this
is in the <HI>Philos. Transact.</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP>. 197. p. 623. There were afterwards
some other Hydrostatical Instruments produc'd, as likewise many
Improvements of the double and single Microscopes, with the use
of small glass Canes and other Contrivances, by which he verify'd
Monsieur <HI>Leuenhook</HI>'s Observations; these, with several others, I
omit, they not being so intelligible without Schemes.</P>
<P>From that time he officiated in that Place, as well as his Curator∣ship,
shewing several Experiments and Instruments in order to ex∣plain
the Gravitation and Alterations in the Air by Vapours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
Contriving an Air-poise to shew the different specifick Gravity of
the Air by a large thin ball of Glass counter-poised.</P>
<P>In <HI>Feb.</HI> 1677-78. upon an account of Monsieur <HI>Gallet</HI>'s Observation
of the Oval Figure of <HI>Mercury</HI> in the Sun, he gave several reasons
for the prolated Oval Figure of the Planets, some of which are
Printed in this Volume, Page 355. with a Demonstrat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on thereof,
and said, “That all Fluids on the Surface would run into that
Shape, and that 'twas not improbable but that the Water here
about the Earth might do so by the influence of the diurnal Mo∣tion
of the Earth, which compounded with that of the Moon, he
conceiv'd was the cause of the Tides.”</P>
<P>From this time he made Microscopal Observations on <HI>Animalcu∣les</HI>
in Peper-water, and other Seeds steeped in Water, confirming
Monsieur <HI>Leuenhook</HI>'s Assertions, and propos'd some improvements
of Microscopes.</P>
<P>Some proposals were made by him of Instruments more accurate
than those formerly invented for sounding the Seas depth, bringing
up Water, or other Substances from the bottom, or any assigned
depth which were some Years after more perfected.</P>
<P><HI>Apr.</HI> 25. 1678. he shew'd an Experiment farther to explain the
action of a Muscle, “which was by a Chain of small Bladders fa∣stened
together, so as by blowing into one Pipe, the whole might
be successively fill'd, and by that means contracted, supposing the
Fibres of the Muscles which seem'd like a Necklace of Pearl in
the Microscope, might be fill'd with a very agill Matter, which
he thought most likely to be Air, which being included in so thin
Skins, was easily wrought upon by Heat, Cold, or the acting
Properties of the Liquors that pass between them, and so perform
the lengthening and contracting of the Muscles.”</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 1678. he read several Discourses, and shew'd Experiments
in order to confirm his Theory of Springs and springy Bodies,
which are publish'd in his Treatise <HI>de Potentia restitutiva</HI> the same Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 31.</NOTE> the sum of which Hypothesis is comprized in a Cypher at
the end of his Description of Helioscopes, being the third of a Deci∣mate
of Inventions which he there mentions he was Master of,
some of which he discover'd himself, affirming he had a Centry of
the like useful Inventions: Others of them I have had the luck to
find out, which I shall take this opportunity of mentioning. I
shall first transcribe what he says of them, and then add the deci∣phering
of them.</P>
<P><PB N="xxi" REF="27"/>
The second Invention, which is the first Cypher, is thus wor∣ded.</P>
<P>“The true Mathematical and Mechanical Form of all manner of
Arches for building with the true butment necessary to each of
them, a Problem which no Architectonick Writer hath ever yet

the Principles upon which Mr. <HI>Savery</HI>'s late invented Engine for
raising Water is founded. See <HI>Lexicon Technicum</HI> under Engine.</P>
<P>On the 29th of <HI>Aug.</HI> 1678. his Grace the Duke of <HI>Norfolke</HI> having
given the <HI>Arundelian</HI> Library to the ROYAL SOCIETY, Mr.
<HI>Hooke</HI> was order'd to be Assistant in making a Catalogue thereof, and
removing it to <HI>Gresham College.</HI></P>
<P>In the beginning of the Year 1679. and afterwards, several Ex∣periments
were repeated to examine the use of the Air in Respira∣tion
by including Animals in common rarify'd and condensed Air,
as likewise concerning the necessity of the Air to maintain Fire, to
illustrate his Theory of Fire farther, <HI>viz.</HI> “That Air is a <HI>Menstruum</HI>
that dissolves all Sulphureous Bodies by burning, and that without
Air no such dissolution will follow, tho' the heat apply'd be ne∣ver
so great, which was try'd particularly by a Charcoal enclos∣ed
in an Iron Case with a Screw-stopper, which tho' violently
heated yet the Cole was not burnt nor wasted when taken out.”</P>
<P>Some Experiments were made to explain the different Gravitati∣on
of the Air, and to shew that Vapours press only according to
their own Gravity, and not according to the space they take up in
the Atmosphere.</P>
<P>Some Contrivances were shewn by him to be added to the Wea∣ther-Clock,
as a Hygroscope, a contrivance to measure the quan∣tity
of Rain, Snow, or Hail fallen in a certain time; which En∣gine
was soon alter perfected in all its parts, and set up in the Re∣pository.</P>
<P>In <HI>July</HI> 1679. he read a Discourse concerning a way to help shor∣ted
Sighted Persons, which he call'd <HI>Myopibus Invamen;</HI> this is Prin∣ted
in his third Collection, p. 59. “At the same time he gave his
Thoughts of the reason of the different apparent Magnitude of
the Sun and Moon in the Meridian and near the Horizon, which
he suppos'd to be a deception of the Eye as judging them when near
the Horizon, to be farther off than when nearer the Zenith, for
that he said the Diameters measur'd were really the same in both
places, or rather something less in the Horizon than in the Zenith,
being remov'd a Semidiameter of the Earth farther off.”</P>
<P><PB N="xxii" REF="28"/>
Experiments were made by him of the mixtures of Metals, par∣ticularly
of Copper and Tin, in which there was observ'd a real
Penetration, the <HI>Compositum</HI> being specifically heavier than either
of the Metals before mixture; for whereas Copper is to Water as 8
½ to 1. and Tin to Water as 7 17/30 to 1. the compositum was to Water
as 8 ¾ to 1.</P>
<P>“In <HI>December,</HI> the same Year, an Experiment being suggested to
try whether the Earth mov'd with a diurnal motion or not, by the
fall of a Body from a considerable height, alledging it would fall to
the East of true Perpendicular: Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> read a Discourse up∣on
that Subject, wherein he explain'd what the Line describ'd by
a falling Body must be, suppos'd to be mov'd circularly by the di∣urnal
motion of the Earth, and perpendicularly by the power of
Gravity, and shew'd it would not be a Spiral Line, but an Ex∣centrical-Elliptoeid,
supposing no resistance in the <HI>medium,</HI> but sup∣posing
a Resistance, it would be an Excentric-Ellipti-Spiral,
which after many Revolutions, would rest in the Center at last;
that the fall of the Body would not be directly East, but to the
South-East, and more to the South than the East. This was try'd,
in which the Ball was still found to fall to the South-East.”</P>
<P>The remainder of this Year was spent in making Experiments
of the mixture of several Metals, among the rest Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> took
notice in the mixture of Copper and Tin of several particulars, as First,
“That the colour of the Copper was quite destroy'd, it ap∣pearing
much of the colour of Iron Polish'd. Secondly, That
the Composition, tho' made of two very malleable Metals, was
yet very brittle and friable. Thirdly, That it bore a pretty good
Polish and Reflection. Fourthly, That tho' Copper is exceeding
hard to be melted, yet the mixture melted very easily. Fifthly,
That viewing the Polish'd Surface with a Microscope, he found
it very full of very small holes or blebs in the Metal.”</P>
<P>In <HI>April</HI> 1680. he produc'd a new invented Level.</P>
<P>In <HI>May</HI> he read a Paper of Observations upon an unusual sort of
Hail-stones that fell on the 18th. the sum of which was to this pur∣pose.
About ten a Clock in the Morning it grew very dark and
Thundered much, and near to the S. E. when soon after the Hail
fell from the size of Pistol-Bullets to the bigness of Pullets Eggs,
the smaller were white like Chalk, and pretty round, the larger
Conical or Oval, upon breaking them they were found to be
made of several Orbs, encompassing one another; several had a
white Center or Nucleus in the middle, which in others was more
toward one side; they that exceeded in bigness were made by an
additional accretion of transparent Icecles, radiating from the
white Ball in the middle; some of these stood in distinct transpa∣rent
Rays, in others the Interstices were fill'd up between the Rays
with a white opaque Concretion: The lower part of these Stones
were more flat and like a Turnip, the radiations appearing more
towards the upper side; the sides and top were more rough, and
the ends of the Stiriae were prominent. Before they fell a great
noise was heard in the Sky: From the manner of their Figure Mr.
<HI>Hooke</HI> conceiv'd their accretion was made by a congelation of Wa∣ter
as they fell; that the Globe in the middle about the bigness of
a Pea, was the first drop that concreted into Hail, the Coats being
added to it as it past through the watry Clouds▪ of which some
<PB N="xxiii" REF="29"/>
were white, some pellucid, according to the different coldness of
the Regions they past through.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 8th 1680. upon a Debate concerning the Experiment of my
Lord <HI>Bacon</HI>'s of the internal motion of Bodies, Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> related,
“That he had observ'd that the motion of the Glass, fill'd with
Water, was observ'd to be vibrative, perpendicular to the Sur∣face
of the Glass, and that the Circular Figure chang'd into an
Oval one way, and that the Reciprocation presently changed it
into an Oval the other way, which he discover'd by the motion
of the Undulation or rising of the Water in the Glass, which was
observ'd to be in four places of the Surface in a square posture,
the same Glass being struck on the edge with a Viol-bow, this square
Undulation was very plain, and there was also discover'd
another Undulation, by which the Water was observ'd to rise in
six places like an Hexagon, and upon farther trials also in eight
places like an Octagon; each of these gave their particular and
distinct Sounds or Notes, the 4 and 8 were Octaves, and the 6 and
4 were Fifths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>”</P>
<P>In <HI>November</HI> 1680. he read some Observations he had made of a
<HI>Comet</HI> then appearing, which, with other Observations and Dis∣courses
of other Comets are publish'd in this Volume under that
Title, beginning at Page 194.</P>
<P>And about this time Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> shew'd a Contrivance by a <HI>Statera</HI>
to examine the attractive power of the Magnet at several distances,
and made many Experiments therewith.</P>
<P>In <HI>April</HI> 1681. and afterwards, he read his Lectures of <HI>Light</HI> and
<HI>Luminous</HI> Bodies, which are here collected together, and begin at
Page 71.</P>
<P>In <HI>July</HI> the same Year he shew'd a way of making <HI>Musical and other Sounds,</HI>
by the striking of the Teeth of several Brass Wheels,
proportionally cut as to their numbers, and turned very fast round,
in which it was observable, that the equal or proportional stroaks
of the Teeth, that is, 2 to 1, 4 to 3, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> made the Musical Notes,
but the unequal stroaks of the Teeth more answer'd the sound of
the Voice in speaking.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> following he mention'd a new Sea-Quadrant for mak∣ing
Observations more accurate than could be done by any Instru∣ment
yet known; this is what the Reader will find towards the
end of this Volume: At the same time he first mention'd his new
Compasses for describing all sorts of Spirals, as likewise of the
Rumb-lines, which Instrument I also have indeavour'd to retrieve
from being lost.</P>
<P>Soon after this he shew'd and demonstrated a very expeditious
way of drawing the Rumb-lines exactly true upon a Globe, by an
Instrument grounded upon the same Principle with the other. He
show'd also a very easy way of finding all the possible <HI>foci</HI> of Rays
refracted by a <HI>Plano-Spherical Lens,</HI> whereof the Convex side was
turn'd toward the <HI>focus,</HI> as also the quantity of Rays that would
pass thro' such a Glass, whose Convexity was of the full bigness of
a Hemisphere.</P>
<P>“In <HI>Jan.</HI> 1681-82. he shew'd an Instrument to describe all sorts of
Helixes upon a Cone, by which he affirm'd to be able to divide any
given length, tho' very short, into almost any assignable number
of given parts, as suppose an Inch into 100000 equal parts; this
<PB N="xxiv" REF="30"/>
he conceiv'd very useful for perfecting Astronomical and Geogra∣phical
Instruments. And at the next Meeting he produc'd ano∣ther
Instrument, by which he describ'd a certain Curve Line,
which may be call'd an <HI>Invented Parabola,</HI> or <HI>Parabolical-Hyperbo∣la,</HI>
having these Proprieties, that it is infinite both ways, and
hath two <HI>Asymptotes</HI> as an <HI>Hyperbola,</HI> &amp;c. A third Instrument
was also shew'd for exactly describing the <HI>Spiral</HI> of <HI>Archimedes</HI> by
a new Propriety thereof, and that as easily and truly as a Circle,
whereby not only any given Arch might be divided into any
number of equal parts, but a strait Line given equal to the Cir∣cumference
of a Circle.”</P>
<P>“<HI>March</HI> the first, he shew'd a way, by the same Instrument, of
describing all varieties of Ellipses.”</P>
<P>In the same Year he read the remainder of his Discourses of <HI>Light,</HI>
which are in the following Volume Printed, and particularly that
Lecture explicating the Memory, and how we come by the notion
of Time.</P>
<P>From this time, or rather something before, he began to be more
reserv'd than he had been formerly, so that altho' he often made
Experiments, and shew'd new Instruments and Inventions, and
read his <HI>Cutlerian</HI> Lectures, yet he seldom left any full Account of
them to be enter'd, designing, as he said, to fit them himself for
the Press, and then make them publick, which he never perform'd.
This is the reason that I am oblig'd to be the shorter in the remain∣ing
part of his Life; and shall only touch upon some few of his Per∣formances,
since the bare nameing of them, or mentioning their
Titles, will but create an uneasy Curiosity in the Reader without
any satisfaction.</P>
<P>Several of these Lectures and Discourses I have indeavour'd to
preserve from being lost, by Publishing them in this Book, and some
Instruments are there describ'd.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the Year 1687. his Brothers Daughter, Mrs.
<HI>Grace Hooke</HI> dy'd, who had liv'd with him several Years, the con∣cern
for whose Death he hardly ever wore off, being observ'd from
that time to grow less active, more Melancholly and Cynical.</P>
<P>On the fifth of <HI>May</HI> he read a Lecture of the unequal <HI>diurnal</HI> mo∣tion
of the Earth, which the Reader may find in this Book</P>
<P>In <HI>July</HI> he shew'd an Experiment of the communication of Mo∣tion
by a Packthread extended a very considerable length, and, af∣ter
running over a Pulley, brought back to the place, near to which
the other end was fastened, and it was found that any addition of
Weight or Motion given to the one end, would be immediately
sensible at the other end of the String, tho' it must pass in going and
returning so great a length; there were other ways shewn of com∣municating
motion, as by a long Cane suspended by Strings, or by
Wires distended a great length; in which it was observable, that
the sound was propagated instantaneously, even as quick as the mo∣tion
of Light, the sound convey'd by the Air coming a considerable
time after that by the Wire.</P>
<P>A great part of the next Year he was very weak and ill, being
often troubl'd with Head-achs, Giddiness and Fainting, and with a
general decay all over, which hinder'd his Philosophical Studies,
yet still he read some Lectures whenever he was able. At the same
time a Chancery-Suit, which he was forc'd to have with Sir <HI>John
<PB N="xxv" REF="31"/>
Cutler</HI> for his yearly Salary, made him very uneasy, the trouble of
which increas'd his Illness.</P>
<P>But on the 20th of <HI>June</HI> he read a farther Description con∣cerning
several ways of making a portable <HI>Sea-Barometer,</HI> with the
great uses thereof in foretelling changes of the Weather and Storms.</P>
<P>From this time, for some Years, I find but little done by him, ex∣cept
his reading the Lectures founded by Sir <HI>John Cutler,</HI> several of
which are here Printed, to which the curious are referr'd: Of these
he read in <HI>Dec.</HI> 1691. several relating to improvements of sounding
Instruments which he call'd <HI>Nuntii inanimati ad fundum Abyssi emis∣sarii.</HI>
Having receiv'd a warrant from Dr. <HI>Tillotson</HI> the Arch-bishop
of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> for a <HI>Degree of Dr. of Physick,</HI> he went on the 7th of
<HI>Dec.</HI> the same Year, and took the Oaths before Sir <HI>Charles Hedges</HI> in
<HI>Doctors Commons.</HI></P>
<P>About this time he was employ'd about the contriving and survey∣ing
the Hospital standing near <HI>Hoxton,</HI> given by the Will of Alder∣man
<HI>Ask,</HI> a Building that few will judge any disreputation to the
Contriver, for the due proportion of its Parts, and Beauty of the
whole. I have heard indeed that Dr. <HI>Hooke</HI> has been blam'd for ex∣ceeding
the Sum at first propos'd to be expended thereon; and once
discoursing with him upon that Subject, he own'd to me that it had
far exceeded the first Estimate he had given in of the Charges, but
not by this Fault or Mistake, but partly by new additions and al∣terations
of the first Design, and chiefly by his not procuring and
agreeing with the Workmen himself, which if he had done, as he
said, he would have ingag'd it should have come to little or no more
than his first propos'd Sum. He also propos'd that there might be
instituted in that place, a <HI>Mathematical</HI>-School for Boys to be in∣structed
in the Principles of <HI>Astronomy</HI> and <HI>Navigation,</HI> which at first
was well approv'd of by the persons concern'd in the Management
of that Affair.</P>
<P>On <HI>Thursday</HI> the 8th of <HI>Sep.</HI> 1692. he sets down an Earthquake to
be observ'd by himself exactly 55 Min. past one a Clock p. m. he
notes that there was no Wind but Rain all Day. It was remark∣able
that this Earthquake was felt at the same time not only in most
parts of <HI>England,</HI> but also in several parts of <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>This Year he read a curious Discourse describing the Tower of
<HI>Babel</HI> or <HI>Belus.</HI> The Year following he read several Lectures about
Earthquakes, and an Explication of <HI>Ovid's Metamorphosis,</HI> of which
it is needless to mention the Contents, or the Times, the Dates of most
of them being affixed to them in the following Book, they be∣gin
at Page</P>
<P>On the 18th of <HI>July</HI> 1696. being his Birth Day, his Chancery-Suit
for Sir <HI>John Cutler</HI>'s Salary, was determined for him, to his great
satisfaction, which had made him very uneasy for several Years. In
his Diary he shews his sense of it in these Terms DOMSHLGISS:
A. which I read thus <HI>Deo Opt. Max. summus Honor, Gloria in secula se∣cularum,
Amen. I was Born on this Day of</HI> July 1635. <HI>and</HI> GOD <HI>has
given me a new Birth, may I never forget his Mercies to me; whilst he
gives me Breath may I praise him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>March</HI> the 5th 1697-98. he read a Lecture about the prolated Sphe∣roedical
Figure of the Sun, and other <HI>Phaenomena</HI> thereof, of the
<HI>Maculae</HI> and <HI>Faculae,</HI> &amp;c. of making a Helioscope by four reflex
Planes in a twenty four Foot Tube, or a Telescope for Planets and
<PB N="xxvi" REF="32"/>
fix'd Stars, by two Reflexions in a Tube of forty Foot with Mon∣sieur
<HI>Huygens</HI> 120 Foot Glass, which was well lik'd of.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 27. 1698. he read a Lecture upon <HI>Huygen's Cosmotheoros,</HI> and
shew'd a Module of <HI>Saturn</HI> and his Ring.</P>
<P>Thus I have mention'd some of his Performances, in the latter of
which I have been the more succinct, having exceeded the bounds I
at first intended in the Accounts of the former. It must be confes∣sed
that the later part of his Life was nothing near so fruitful of
Inventions as the former; tho' it is certain he had a design to repeat
the most part of his Experiments, and finish the Accounts, Ob∣servations
and Deductions from them, and had an Order for the So∣cieties
bearing the Charge thereof, in <HI>June</HI> 1696. when he propos'd
likewise to perfect the Description of all the Instruments he had at
any time contriv'd; but by reason of his increasing Weakness and
a general Decay, he was absolutely unable to perform it, had he
desir'd it never so much.</P>
<P>He had for several Years been often taken with a giddiness in his
Head, and sometimes great Pain, little Appetite, and great faint∣ness,
that he was soon very much tir'd with walking, or any Exer∣cise.
About <HI>July</HI> 1697. he began to complain of the swelling and
soreness of his Legs, and was much over-run with the Scurvy, and
about the same time being taken with a giddiness he fell down Stairs
and cut his Head, bruis'd his Shoulder, and hurt his Ribbs, of
which he complain'd often to the last. About <HI>September</HI> he thought
himself (as indeed all others did that saw him) that he could not last
out a Month. About which time his Legs swell'd more and more,
and not long after broke, and for want of due care Mortify'd a lit∣tle
before his Death. From this time he grew blinder and blinder,
that at last he could neither see to Read nor Write. Some of
the last he wrote, I believe was on the 17th of <HI>Dec.</HI> 1702. when he sets
down a Memorandum about an Instrument to take the Horizontal
Diameter of the Sun to the tenth of a second Minute, but disco∣vers
not the way.</P>
<P>Thus he liv'd a dying Life for a considerable time, being more
than a Year very infirm, and such as might be call'd Bed-rid for
the greatest part, tho' indeed he seldom all the time went to Bed
but kept in his Cloaths, and when over tir'd, lay down upon his
Bed in them, which doubtless brought several Inconveniences upon
him, so that at last his Distempers of shortness of Breath, Swelling,
partly of his Body, but mostly of his Legs, increasing, and at last
Mortifying, as was observ'd after his Death by their looking very
black, being emaciated to the utmost, his Strength wholly worn
out, he dy'd on the third of <HI>March</HI> 1702-03. being 67 Years, 7 Months,
and 13 Days Old.</P>
<P>His Corps was decently and handsomely interr'd in the Church
of St. <HI>Hellen</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> all the Members of the ROYAL SOCIETY
then in Town attending his Body to the Grave, paying the Respect
due to his extraordinary Merit.</P>
<P>As to his Person he was but despicable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Character.</NOTE> being very crooked, tho' I
have heard from himself, and others, that he was strait till about 16
Years of Age when he first grew awry, by frequent practicing,
turning with a Turn-Lath, and the like incurvating Exercises, being
but of a thin weak habit of Body, which increas'd as he grew older,
so as to be very remarkable at last: This made him but low of Sta∣ture,
<PB N="xxvii" REF="33"/>
tho' by his Limbs he shou'd have been moderately tall. He
was always very pale and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lean, and laterly nothing but Skin and
Bone, with a meagre Aspect, his Eyes grey and full, with a sharp
ingenious Look whilst younger; his Nose but thin, of a moderate
height and length; his Mouth meanly wide, and upper Lip thin;
his Chin sharp, and Forehead large; his Head of a middle size.
He wore his own Hair of a dark Brown colour, very long and hang∣ing
neglected over his Face uncut and lank, which about three Year
before his Death he cut off, and wore a Periwig. He went stoop∣ing
and very fast (till his weakness a few Years before his Death hin∣dred
him) having but a light Body to carry, and a great deal of Spirits and Activity, especially in his Youth.</P>
<P>He was of an active, restless, indefatigable Genius even almost
to the last, and always slept little to his Death, seldom going to
Sleep till two three, or four a Clock in the Morning, and seldomer
to Bed, oftener continuing his Studies all Night, and taking a short
Nap in the Day. His Temper was Melancholy, Mistrustful and Jea∣lous,
which more increas'd upon him with his Years. He was in the
beginning of his being made known to the Learned, very commu∣nicative
of his Philosophical Discoveries and Inventions, till some
Accidents made him to a Crime close and reserv'd. He laid the
cause upon some Persons, challenging his Discoveries for their own,
taking occasion from his Hints to perfect what he had not; which
made him say he would suggest nothing till he had time to perfect
it himself, which has been the Reason that many things are lost,
which he affirm'd he knew. He had a piercing Judgment into the
Dispositions of others, and would sometimes give shrewd Guesses
and smart Characters.</P>
<P>From his Youth he had been us'd to a Collegiate, or rather Mo∣nastick
Life, which might be some reason of his continuing to live
so like an Hermit or Cynick too penuriously, when his Circumstan∣ces,
as to Estate, were very considerable, scarcely affording him∣self
Necessaries.</P>
<P>I indeed, as well as others, have heard him declare sometimes
that he had a great Project in his Head as to the disposal of the most
part of his Estate for the advancement of Natural Knowledge, and
to promote the Ends and Designs for which the ROYAL SOCIETY
was instituted: To build an handsome Fabrick for the <HI>Societies</HI> use,
with a Library, Respositary, Laboratory, and other Conveniencies
for making Experiments, and to found and endow a perpetual <HI>Phy∣sico-Mechanick
Lecture</HI> of the Nature of what himself read. But tho'
he was often solicited by his Friends to put his Designs down in Writ∣ing,
and make his Will as to the disposal of his Estate to his own
liking in the time of his Health; and after when himself, and all
thought, his End drew near, yet he could never be prevail'd with
to perfect it, still procrastinating it, till at last this great Design
prov'd an airy Phantom and vanish'd into nothing. Thus he dy'd
at last without any Will and Testament that could be found. It is
ndeed but a melancholy Reflexion, that while so many rich and
great Men leave considerable Sums for founding Hospitals, and the
the like pious Uses, few since Sir <HI>Thomas Gresham</HI> should do any thing
of this kind for the promoting of Learning, which no doubt would
be as much for the Good of the Nation, and Glory of God, as the
other of releiving the Poor.</P>
<P><PB N="xxviii" REF="34"/>
He always exprest a great Veneration for the eternal and im∣mense
Cause of all Beings, as may be seen in very many Passages in
his Writings, and seldom receiv'd any remarkable Benefit from
God without thankfully ackowledging the Mercy; never made a∣ny
considerable discovery in Nature, invented any useful Contri∣vance,
or found out any difficult Problem, without setting down
his Acknowledgement to the Omnipotent Providence, as many places
in his Diary testify, frequently in these or the like words, abbrevia∣ted
thus, DOMGM. and was a frequent studier of the Holy Scri∣pture
in the Originals: If he was particular in some Matters, let
us leave him to the searcher of Hearts.</P>
<P>To conclude, all his Errors and Blemishes were more than made
amends for, by the Greatness and Extent of his natural and acqui∣red
Parts, and more than common, if not wonderful Sagacity, in
diving into the most hidden Secrets of Nature, and in contriving

the Phaenomena of Nature, and demonstrating his Asser∣tions;
his happy Talent in adapting Theories to the Phaenomena ob∣serv'd,
and contriving easy and plain, not pompous and amusing
Experiments to back and prove those Theories; proceeding from Ob∣servations
to Theories, and from Theories to farther trials, which
he often asserted to be the most proper method to succeed in the in∣terpretation

<HEAD>FIRST GENERAL.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Present State of Natural Philosophy,
and wherein it is deficient.</HEAD>
<P>THE Business of Philosophy is to find out a perfect Knowledge
of the Nature and Proprieties of Bodies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">First Generals</NOTE> and of the Causes of
Natural Productions, and this Knowledge is not barely acquir'd
for it self, but in order to the inabling a Man to understand how
by the joyning of fit Agents to Patients according to the Orders,
Laws, Times and Methods of Nature, he may be able to produce and bring to
pass such Effects, as may very much conduce to his well being in this World,
both for <HI>satisfying his Desires,</HI> and the relieving of his <HI>Necessities:</HI> And for ad∣vancing
his State above the common Condition of Men, and make him able to
excel them as much, almost, as they do Brutes or Ideots.</P>
<P>Now though there have been many Men, in divers Ages of the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Present State of</HI> Na∣tural Philoso∣phy.</NOTE> which
seem to have had some confus'd and imperfect Conception of this Idea of the
Business of Philosophy, and accordingly seem to have had some Aims and De∣signs
towards the attaining of their propos'd end; yet having not a right Un∣derstanding
of the chief end, and failing much more in the Knowledge of the
Means, or the manner of making use of them, they have generally left Philo∣sophical
Knowledge almost in the Condition they found it: Without making any
considerable Increase or Addition to it. Whence this kind of Knowledge
has been very little promoted ever since the very first times we have had any
History of it. And though is has always made a fair shew of flourishing; yet
upon Examination, it has been found to yield Leaves instead of solid Fruit, to
be a Knowledge very confus'd and imperfect, and very insignificant as to the
inabling a Man to practise or operate by it.</P>
<P>This seems to have proceeded from divers Causes, as</P>
<P>First, from the Unskilfulness of the Inventors and Founders of it, who seem
to have many ways contributed thereto.</P>
<P>1. First in that they had not a true Idea of the Design and thing it self,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Reasons of the Deficiency of</HI> Natural Phi∣losophy.</NOTE> their
Aims were low and mean, and reacht but at small things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. From the first Inv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 3 Way<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> such as the giving the
Explication of things in hard words, which might serve to amuse their Auditors,
and to raise some Esteem of themselves amongst them, scarce ever thinking,
much less indeavouring to find out the true Nature and Proprieties of Bodies;
what the inward Texture and Constitution of them is, and what the Internal
Motions, Powers and Energies are, and how they may be made use of for produ∣cing
such Changes and Transformations of Bodies from one thing to another as
is desired.</P>
<P>2. Next in that they were as ignorant of the true <HI>means</HI> of attaining it, as
they were of the Knowledge of the End. Some esteem indeed we find them to
have had of <HI>Natural History,</HI> and some Imagination they had that it was con∣ducive
to Natural Knowledge, but what History was requisite, they neither
had, or indeed so much as knew, for what we find in <HI>Aristotle, Pliny,</HI> and
others called by that Name, is so uncertain and superficial, taking notice only of
some slight and obvious things, and those so unaccurately, as makes them signify
but little; but as for the more subtile Examinations of Natural Bodies, by
Dissections, Experiments, or Mechanical Tryals, we find them not to mention
them as needful, much less to have practised them. Nor can I perceive that
they had any Affection or Industry for Experiments, much less for such as ought
to be vigorously prosecuted with Care and Judgment: Nor do they seem to
have had that Strictness and Accurateness as is requisite in setting down or re∣gistring
those things which their Writings contain, but good and indifferent
<PB N="4" REF="38"/>
and stark naught are without Distinction mixt together, true and probable and
false are all alike dignified, nor are they so accurate in their Descriptions, even
of not common things that they help us with; but a great part of them we find
to be a needless insisting upou the outward Shape and Figure, or Beauty, and
the like, or else of some Magical and Superstitious Effects Producible by it seem∣ing
to aim at creating Pleasure, and Divertisement or Admiration and Wonder,
and not of such a Knowledge of Bodies as might tend to Practice.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> In that, as they knew not the means, so neither did they the
<HI>manner</HI> of making use of them, in which Particular we may find them to be
much more to seek than in knowing what Materials were requisite. Their Me∣thod
herein indeed was most preposterous and very pernicious, for first we find
them much inclin'd to a Belief of implanted Notions, at least in their Practice,
though some of them affirm, <HI>Nihil esse in intellectu quod non fuit prius in sensu,</HI>
yet upon the whole, we may find that in their manner of proceeding they did
quite otherwise. From a very few uncertain Histories they usually rais'd the
most general Deductions, and from them though never so imperfect, would
needs prescribe Laws to the Universe and Nature it self. In this they were ve∣ry
supercilious, and very angry to be contradicted, and maintained their Opi∣nions
more because they had asserted them, than because they were true, they
studied more to gain Applause and make themselves admired, or the Head of
some Sect, or the Author of some strange Opinion, or the Opposer of some one
already famous Doctrine, or the like, than to perfect their Knowledge, or to
discern the Secrets of Nature, or advance the active Power of Man over the
Creatures. Nor was this all; but we may find them even to wrest those few
Experiments and Observations they had read, or collected, and to endeavour
rather to adapt them to their Hypothesis, than to regulate their Thoughts by
them, esteeming their own Understandings to be the Mine of all Science, and
that by pertinacious ruminating, they could thence produce the true Image and
Picture of the Universe.</P>
<P>Nor was this the only ill Fortune of true Science, but there is somewhat more
behind. A Second Reason therefore why Philosophy has not increased is to be
ascribed to the Sectators of these Theories,<NOTE PLACE="marg">II. From the Sectators from several Causes.</NOTE> who at best have not improv'd it to
a nearer Approach to Truth, but have rather made it worse than bettet, and
more obscure by Interpretation. The Reason of which seems to be from these
Particulars.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1"/>From their manner of Institution, being bred up with a Prejudice against the
search of Truth elsewhere, than in Books thereby chained up by the imbib'd
Principles and Dictates of their Teachers, and their Minds habituated to a loath∣ing
of any thing that offered it self as a Novelty or new Discovery, and upon
that account whether true or false rejected. This proceeded partly in the 2d.
Place.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"/>From an Imagination they have that Arts are already come to their highest
pitch of Perfection, and that therefore 'tis in vain to endeavour to find out that
by the most difficult way, which might be obtained more easily and fully
out of Books.</P>
<P>This Aversion also to Inquiries and New Discoveries proceeded partly also
in the 3d. Place.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3"/>From a too great Reverence and Esteem for the Writings of the Ancients, as
supposing those to be the greatest Men for Wisdom and Knowledge, and those
Ages wherein they liv'd to be the elder Times of the World; and therefore they
accounted it a great piece of Folly, and a kind of Impiety to contradict, or endea∣vour
to be wiser than their Fore-fathers.</P>
<P>Hence proceeded a <HI>Fourth</HI> Impediment, namely,</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="4"/>From their following the same Way and Method in illustrating or endea∣vouring
to understand their Writings, that the Authors themselves did in com∣posing
them: And therefore 'tis not to be expected that Water should rise high∣er
than the Fountain Head from whence it came; or that greater and more nota∣ble
Effects should be produced by any other than an extrarodinary Method. For
the Logick or way of Ratiocination they have made use of, hath been rather an
Hindrance than a Furtherance. For neither is the way of <HI>Syllogising</HI> as it ought
<PB N="5" REF="39"/>
nor are their first <HI>Notions</HI> stated aright, and
consequently their Axioms and Conclusions cannot be better than the Grounds and Principles from which they
were rais'd; so that it does not only not promote real Knowledge, but is inju∣rious
to it, by begetting an Opinion of Science where there is no such thing.</P>
<P>5<HI>ly,</HI> From their mistaken Aim or Scope, which is an indeavour by Nice Distin∣ctions<MILESTONE N="5"/>
to wrest over all the Observations they chance to stumble upon, and
make them correspondent with their already believ'd Theory; instead of an in∣deavour
to rectify and regulate those so receiv'd Theories by those Intimations,
which careful and accurate Observations would afford.</P>
<P>6<HI>ly,</HI> Such as have a little varied from the receiv'd Opinions, the Alteration has<MILESTONE N="6"/>
been rather for the bringing in some one New Hypothesis or Opinion of their
own instead of the Old, and not for the renewing or Amending the whole.</P>
<P>7<HI>ly,</HI> And some that have indeavoured to make use of Arguments rais'd from the<MILESTONE N="7"/>
Experiments, and Observations, have been so confounded with them, for want
of a Method of proceeding; that it has been to little purpose, save the putting of Men upon new Tryals, whereby perhaps some useful Experiment has been
light on, and thereby some latent Error in the former Theories detected. For
neither having a true Idea of making Observations and Experiments, nor a con∣venient
way of ordering, nor a right Method of using them, the greater num∣ber
of them they have, the more are they confounded; for 'tis not the Multi∣tude
of Experiments nor the Excellency of them, nor is it indeed the subtile
and curious Ratiocinations of an accomplisht Mind, nor the Endeavours of a
Multitude of such joyned together, that will be able to do any great matter in
this Design; for such Endeavours do at best but raise new Probabilities, and
consequently augment Disputes on the one hand, and new Tryals on the other,
and all to as little purpose as 'twould be to attempt to find some extreamly
difficult Geometrical Problem by the Ruler and Compass, without the Know∣ledge
or Help of Geometrical Algebra.</P>
<P>For where the Examination and Comparison of so great a Number of Parti∣culars
is requisite, and where the Process is long, and the Informations but thinly
scatter'd, and those also in the Dark, 'tis not to be expected from the most
subtile Wit, that the whole Operation should be only performed by the Strength
of its Memory, and the Activity of its Ratiocination, though each of them in the
greatest pitch of Perfection; much less can it be hoped from Endeavours, that
want either of these Accomplishments. And how usual 'tis for one of these to
be defective where▪ the other prevails, may be sufficiently evident from the al∣most
Proverbial Saying, that good Wits have ill Memories. Some things
indeed have been by lucky Inquirers light on by chance, but those so few and
seldom, that 'twas not absurd in <HI>Pythagoras</HI> to offer up a <HI>Hecatomb</HI> for a single
Invention in Geometry. I do not here with the Scepticks affirm, that nothing
is or can be known, my Design is quite another thing; their end only in deny∣ing
any thing to be knowable, seems to be Dispute, and tends to Ignorance and
Laziness, mine on the other side supposes all things as po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ible to be known,
and accordingly studies and considers of the Means that seem to tend to that end,
and rouses up the deceiv'd Faculties to seek a Means of recovering themselves
out of their Thraldom, and of improving, rectifying and inlarging their Powers.
They affirm positively nothing can be known any way, I only that many more
things may be discover'd by this Method I here propound, than are already
known.</P>
<P>Nor is the State of Philosophy as yet very much improved by our Modern
Writers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">III. Philosophy hitherto not much improved by the Mo∣derns, and the Reasons why.</NOTE> who have endeavour'd to illustrate or piece up the old, by adding
some Placits of their own: There are yet many Impediments to be removed,
and many Helps to be supplied before any very great Increase in Knowledge is
to be expected. It may be questioned whether piecing or mending will serve
the turn, or whether there must not be a new Foundation laid on the Informa∣tions
of our Senses, and more strictly examined and surveyed by accurate and
judicious Experiments and Observations. That which hath had the Cultivation
of many Hundreds of Years, and by divers very acute Men in all Ages, and
yet as to the Inquiry after the Causes of Natural Efficients, has made so little,
if any Progress at all, cannot with any Probability be imagined to afford a Me∣thod
sufficient for this Inquiry. I do not here altogether reject <HI>Logick,</HI> of the
<PB N="6" REF="40"/>
way of Ratiocination already known; as a thing of no use. It has its pecu∣liar
Excellencies and Uses, in ordinary Discourse and Conversation: And af∣fords
some Helps to some kinds of Invention, especially of Arguments▪ as well
as to the Memory, by its Method: It affords copious Matter for Disputes as
well for, as against the Truth, and teaches how to solve, as well as how to
make a fallacious Assertion. It shews how the Modes of speaking and argu∣ing
may be reduced to certain Rules, and how each compleat Sentence may be
trisected into its constituent Parts, and how those may be various ways shuffl'd
and chang'd, and likewise on occasion also how each of these bigger may be di∣vided
into three less. But as to the Inquiry into Natural Operations, what are
the Kinds of secret and subtile Actors, and what the abstruse and hidden Instru∣ments
and Engines there made use of, may be; It seems not, to me, as yet at
all adapted and wholly deficient. For 'tis not to be expected from the Accom∣plishments
the Creator has endowed Man withal, that he should be able to leap,
from a few particular Informations of his Senses, and those very super∣ficial
at best, and for the most part fallacious, to the general Knowledge of
Universals or abstracted Natures, and thence be able, as out of an inexhaustable
Fountain, to draw out a perfect Knowledge of all Particulars, to deduce the
Causes of all Effects and Actions from this or that Axiome or Sentence, and as
it were intuitively, to know what Nature does or is capable of effecting: And
after what manner and Method she works; and yet that Method supposes little
less: Man's Memory seems very shallow and infirm, and so is very prone to
forget many Circumstances, besides it cannot so well propound all it does re∣member,
to be examin'd at once by the Judgment; but prefers some things first
in order, before others, and some things with more Vehemence and greater con∣cern,
and accordingly the Understanding is more apt to be sway'd to this or
that hand, according as it is more affected or prest by this or that Instance,
and is very liable to oversee some considerable Passages, or to neglect them; and thence very apt to be seduc'd, in pronouncing positively for this or that
Opinion, especially being very prone to run into the affirmative way of judging,
and wanting Patience to follow and prosecute the negative way of Inquiry, by
Rejection of Disagreeing Natures.</P>
<P>Farther, a great Cause why Philosophy has not formerly or of late increased,
is because the greatest part of Learned Men have applied themselves to other
Studies, Divinity, Law, Physick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as being those standing Professions where∣by
Men of the most liberal and ingenuous Education and Spirit might provide
for themselves, and promote their Fortune in the World: Taking only a tran∣sient
View of Natural Philosophy, in their Passage to other things, thinking it
sufficient to be able to talk of it in the Phrase of the School. Nor is it only so
now, but it has been so almost in all Ages, so that for about two Thousand
Years, of which we have some accoun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in History, there is not above one quar∣ter
of that space wherein Men have been Philosophically given, and among
such as have been so, several of them have been so far disjoined by Time, Lan∣guage,
and Climate, by manner of Education, Manners, Opinions, and divers
other Prejudices, that it could not be expected it should make any considerable
Progress: For either because it seemed to promise little, Men for the most part
have neglected it, or in those short spaces of time in which it was somewhat
more minded and look'd after, what from the want of Dowry belonging to
other liberal Professions, what from the Contests of sevetal Theorists, and the
Defect of applying of it to such things as might be useful to Humane Life;
Men have been either discouraged from the Study, or tired our in it.</P>
<P>Some other Course therefore must be taken to promote the Search of Know∣ledge.
Some other kind of Art for Inquiry than what hath been hitherto made
use of, must be discovered; the Intellect is not to be suffer'd to act without its
Helps, but is continually to be assisted by some Method or Engine, which shall
be as a Guide to regulate its Actions, so as that it shall not be able to act amiss:
Of this Engine, no Man except the incomparable <HI>Verulam,</HI> hath had any
Thoughts, and he indeed hath promoted it to a very good pitch; but there is
yet somewhat more to be added, which he seem'd to want time to compleat.
By this, as by that Art of <HI>Algebra</HI> in Geometry, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>twill be very easy to pro∣ceed
in any Natural Inquiry, regularly and certainly: And indeed it may not
<PB N="7" REF="41"/>
improperly be call'd a Philosophical Algebra, or an Art of directing the Mind
in the search after Philosophical Truths, for as 'tis very hard for the most acute
Wit to find out any difficult Problem in Geometry, without the help of <HI>Algebra</HI>
to direct and regulate the Acts of the Reason in the Process from the Question
to the <HI>quaesitum,</HI> and altogether as easy for the meanest Capacity acting by that
Method to compleat and perfect it, so will it be in the Inquiry after Natural
Knowledge.</P>
<P>The greatest and most accomplisht Wits for these many Ages have labour'd
and sweat in these Inquiries, and yet they have not been able to bring forth any
greater Effects than Probabilities: Whereas I cannot doubt but that if this Art
be well prosecuted and made use of, an ordinary Capacity with Industry, will
be able to do very much more than has yet been done, and to shew that even
Physical and Natural Enquiries as well as Mathematical and Geometrical, will
be capable also of Demonstration so that henceforward the business of Inven∣tion
will not be so much the Effect of acute Wit, as of a serious and industrious
Prosecution: And therefore, I hope as I shall not seem to detract from the
Parts and Excellency of the Ancients, but rather to admire and magnify their
Wit and Industry that they were able to proceed so far as they did, without the
Help of this Method, so I hope I shall not be look'd on as vain or boasting, or
extolling of the present Abilities of this Age, if by the Prosecution of this Me∣thod
I expect and assert a much greater Proficiency. And this Art we owe first
and chiefly to that excellent Person I now mention'd, who was able to over∣come
all the Difficulties of Prejudice, with which Mens Minds are usually beset,
and to consider and weigh the Nature of things so far, as not only to discover the
Impediments of Learning, but to contrive a Method how to free the Mind from
them; and likewise to fortify and inrich it with such a Method, as shall be a
constant Guide and Assistant to regulate all its Motions, so that by the use of
it, it may be able to go through with its Undertaking, and as with an Engine
to perform incomparably much more than 'tis possible to do without that
Assistance.</P>

<DIV1>
<HEAD>SECOND GENERAL.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the True Method of Building a Solid Philosophy,
or of a Philosophical Algebra.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Method of a Philosophical Algebra,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philosophical Algebra con∣sists of two <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> I shall divide into two main
Branches.</P>
<P>The First shall contain the manner of Preparing the Mind, and Furnishing it

<P>The former therefore has these Three Parts considerable in it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The former <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> three Parts</NOTE> which shall be
treated of in three distinct Sections.</P>
<P>1st. An Examination of the Constitution and Powers of the Soul, or an At∣tempt
of Disclosing the Soul to its self, being an Endeavour of Discovering the
Perfections and Imperfections of Humane Nature, and finding out ways and
means for the attaining of the one, and of helping the other.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> A Method of making use of, or employing these Means and Assistances
of Humane Nature for collecting the Phenomena of Nature, and for compiling
of a Philosophical History. Consisting of an exact Description of all sorts of
<PB N="8" REF="42"/>
Natural and Artificial Operations, or a Method of making Experiments and
Observations for the Prosecution and Examination of any Philosophical in∣quiry.</P>
<P>3<HI>dly,</HI> A Method of describing, registring and ranging these Particulars so col∣lected,
as that they may become the most adapted Materials for the raising of
Axioms and the Perfecting of Natural Philosophy.</P>
<P>Part I.] There are two things considerable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Powers the Soul.</NOTE> the Imperfections of our Na∣tures
and the Perfections as to the first, the Imperfections: The Mind of Man
suffers under various Prejudices, which do either darken or clog its Faculties,
so as that it cannot exert and make use of them, and these we are subject to.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">§ 1. Of the Imperfections thereof, and how they may be helped.</NOTE> From our own Nature and Constitution, as we are Men, and indued
with such Organs as are capable of taking Information of the Operations of Na∣ture,
only by some few peculiar ways of Sensation: Man is not indued with an
intuitive Faculty, to see farther into the Nature of things at first, than the Su∣perficies
and out-sides, and so must go a long way about before he can be able
to behold the Internal Nature of things, and in this Progress there is very
great Danger of his miscarrying;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st. Cause of Prejudice from our own Na∣ture.</NOTE> for endeavouring to make use of the Informa∣tions
Sense, for that end, there are so many ways of mistaking, that most
have fallen into them: Some have fallen presently upon abstracted Notions, and
flown immediately from a very few particular Sensations to the most General
and Universal Conclusions and Theories, others on the other side have been so
amazed and confounded with Particulars, that they have only proceeded, gro∣ping
on after other Particulars, thinking at last they may by chance light upon
something that may afford them Information in what they look after: Some
others have endeavoured to intermix both these together, but with so very ill
Success, that they have left but little Fruit of their Endeavours.</P>
<P>The greatest Design indeed of the Organs of Sense, seems to have been for
some other Use than for the acquiring of this kind of Knowledge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The chief De∣sign of the Senses.</NOTE> and to have
a very great Affinity with the Senses of other Animals; which seem to have
been made purposely for the peculiar Use of each several Species: The Sight
for discovering Conveniences and Inconveniences at a greater Distance as well
as near at hand: The Ear, for receiving Warning or Information from Sound,
where the Eye could not assist: The Nose, for distinguishing by the Effluvia of
Bodies, of wholsome or unwholsome Nourishment: The Taste for the same
purpose, by the Dissolution of them in the Mouth, and for the determining of
the Quantity requisite to be taken at a time. The Feeling, for the Sensation of
External Textures or Motions. But yet the greater Perfection of Ratiocination
in Man, may make them capable of other kind of Informations: Though in∣deed
of themselves they afford little as to what we are looking after. The Ap∣prehension
also or common Sense is not of the Nature of the things so sensated,
but only with some peculiar Reference to our own Structure. Thus some Tastes
are sweet or sowre to us, which I make a great doubt whether they are so to
the Senses of other Creatures: And those things seem pleasant in the Smell to
other Creatures Senses, which to our Senses seem quite otherwise.</P>
<P>So that our Apprehensions of things seem to be appropriated to our Species:
And that if there were another Species of Intelligent Creatures in the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Apprehen∣sions appropri∣ated to our Species.</NOTE> they
might have quite another kind of Apprehension of the same thing, and neither
perhaps such as they ought to be, and each of them adapted to the peculiar
Structure of that Animal Body in which the Sensation is made. Thus we, by
having our Organ of Hearing moved by a certain Motion of the Air, caused by
a quick Vibration of some solid Body, have a peculiar Conception of Sound;
not to be exprest to a deaf Man, or one that has not the same kind of Organ or
manner of Apprehension. We do not so conceive of it as of a Notion in the
Sonorous Body, but as of a Quality which we know not how to express our
Conception of, but as of something that does pleasingly affect our Hearing, and
we call that Conception we have of it Sound. But if we observe that Propriety
in the sounding Body by the Eye, we have there quite another Idea of it imprest
on our Phantcy, and nothing at all of the Imagination of Sound, but only of a
<PB N="9" REF="43"/>
Body in a Vibrative Motion. And if we sensate that Propriety in the Vibra∣ting
Body by our Feeling, we have quite a differing Idea of the same Propriety,
and there we have an Imagination of it, which we call tingling or tickling, or
Heat: From which it seems evident, that those Imaginations we have of things,
are not according to the Nature of the things themselves; but only appropria∣ted
to the peculiar Organs, by which they are made sensible to the Understand∣ing.
So that had we other kinds of Organs, we should have other kinds of
Conceptions of those Effects. And those perhaps we have may be quite differ∣ing
from what other Creatures have of the same thing. Thus that Constitu∣tion
of Air, which we call dark, is not so to Cats and Owls, and the like;
nor is it so indeed to a Man if his Eyes are assisted by some peculiar kind of In∣struments,
as I have divers times found by Experiment, wherein I have been
able to see to read the Letters and Words distinct in such a Light, wherein,
without that help, I have hardly been able to see the Lines. Thus Heat and
Cold are only Relative to our Constitution, as is evident by the Weather Glass,
which feels many Degrees of Heat before it be sensible to us.</P>
<P>The best Remedy therefore that seems to be against this Prejudice is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remedy for these Preju∣dices from the Senses.</NOTE> to com∣pare
the several Informations we receive of the same thing, from the several Im∣pressions
it makes on the several Organs of Sense and (by a Rejection of what
is not consonant) by degrees to find out its Nature, and thereby to inform the
Intellect with a Notion of the thing; which is not according to this or that
Idea, rais'd from the Impression of this or that Sense, but by a comparative
Act of the Understanding from all the various Informations 'tis capable of re∣ceiving,
more immediately by any of the Senses, or more mediately by various
other Observations or Experiments.</P>
<P>We ought to conceive of things as they are part of, and Actors or Patients
in the Universe, and not only as they have this or that peculiar Relation or In∣fluence
on our own Senses or selves. And for this cause we ought to be very
careful in what Sense we understand Philosophical Words already in use, for
these having been for the most part made by such as had those Prejudices re∣maining
on them, and we also having first received in or imbibed the Senses of
those words, whilst under the like Prejudices: It cannot be expected but that
the Notions must be very confused and inconsistent with the things them∣selves.</P>
<P>Another Cause of Prejudice is from every Man's own peculiar Structure:
Every Man has born with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d. Cause of Prejudice from the peculiar Structure of every Man, or particular bent of his Studies.</NOTE> or contracted by some way or other, a Consti∣tution
of Body and Mind, that does more or less dispose him to this or that kind
of Imagination or Phant'sy of things, and every one has some kind of
Accident or other, that does more or less dispose him for this Opinion or
that Operation of the Mind as well as of the Body. Thus some kind of Con∣stitutions
of Body does more incline a Man to Contemplation, and Speculation, another to Operation,
Examination, and making Experiments, and look what
way the Constitution of a Man, or some other Accident has inclin'd him to, that
way almost are bent all his other Faculties and Powers. Thus one is for speak∣ing,
and another for Writing, and all things are look'd on, or disregarded by
such, as they are subservient to such an end: And not only many things, not
very instructive, are let pass; but sometimes also many things that have no
such Indication in them, are brought in as 'twere by the Head and Shoulders,
and wrested, to be made compliable to this or that Opinion. Just as a Man that
is troubled with the Jaundice, supposes all things to be Yellow, and all things
he eats, till otherwise prevented, serve to augment his Choler, by being chang'd
into it: Or a melancholy Person, that thinks he meets with nothing but fright∣ful
Apparitions, does convert all things he either sees or hears into dreadful
Representations, and makes use of them to strengthen his Phant'sy, and fill it
fuller of such uneasy Apprehensious, so is it in Constitutions of Mind as to
Philosophy. Thus <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s Physick is very much influenced by his Logick:
<HI>Des Cartes</HI> Philosophy savours much of his Opticks: <HI>Van Helmonts,</HI> and the
rest of the Chymists of their Chimical Operations: <HI>Gilberts</HI> of the Loadstone:
<HI>Pythagoras</HI>'s and <HI>Jordanus Brunus</HI>'s, <HI>Kepler</HI>'s, &amp;c. of Arithmetick and the Harmony
of Numbers. The Philosophy, of some Divines, is intermingled with Divinity;
of others, with Spirits and immaterial Agents: Astrologers endeavour to bring
<PB N="10" REF="44"/>
all things under the Power and Influence of Caelestial Bodies, and would have
them the chief Efficients of the World, and indeed every one according to the
things he most fancies naturally, or has accidentally studied, and is most con∣versant
in, endeavours to make all things he meets with, agreeable or subser∣vient
thereto. And he is much the more inclin'd to maintain and defend this or
that Opinion, if he has once any way publickly owned it, whether in Writing
or Discourse, so far too perhaps sometimes, that though at first he defended it
when he thought otherwise, yet by continuing to do so for the maintaining of
an Argument, or of his Credit, he at last comes to believe it, and the Fallacy,
which he endeavoured to put upon others, imposes most of all upon him∣self.</P>
<P>The best Remedy against this Inconvenience,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Remedies against this.</NOTE> is the finding out of what Con∣stitution
ones self is, and to what one is either naturally or accidentally most
inclin'd to believe, and accordingly by reasoning and comparing things together
to consider what the things themselves hint, and what Intimation proceeds from
ones own Constitution.</P>
<P>Next, to accustom ones self as much as can be for a while at least, to a quite
contrary Supposal or Practice: Or which is indeed more general, not to receive
any Notion for certain, till throughly confirm'd by very Cogent Arguments and
Ratiocinations, and always most to suspect that which seems most consonant
and pleasing to our Inclination: Thus one, that fancies Novelty, should be most
cautious of what he admits for Truth or Demonstration that is new; le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t his
Mind being prejudiced with a Love of Novelties, should otherwise impose up∣on
his Belief and Understanding: Thus one that is addicted to Chymical or
Mechanical Operations, should be very cautious of admitting of a Chymical
or Mechanical Solution, and so for the rest; for that may seem very probable
and rational to one, whose Mind is so inclin'd; which to one of another Con∣stitution
will seem most unlikely and absurd: So one, inclin'd to Speculation
and abstracting, should bridle his Nature and not fly too soon to the most ge∣ral
Conclusions, for as a Nature so inclin'd does willingly oftentimes impose
upon it self, and longs to be acting, and running in its proper and most known
Road, and avoids that Method it is not acquainted with, finding it very uncouth
and full of many new Difficulties. So though the reason should be satisfied,
and the Phant'sy full of the Truth of this or that Opinion, another Mind other∣wise
qualified, may find many Flaws and Errors in it, and perceive many things
to have proceeded from Prejudice.</P>
<P>A Third Cause of Prejudice is from Language,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A 3d. Cause of Prejudice from Education and the unaccurate use of words.</NOTE> Education, Breeding, Con∣versation,
Instruction, Study, from an Esteem of Authors, Tutors, Masters, An∣tiquity,
Novelty, Fashions, Customs, or the like. The Philosophical words,
of all Languages yet known in the World, seem to be for the most part very
improper Marks, set on confused and complicated Notions, together with the
Learning of which Language we have imbibed those confus'd Notions, which
are commonly understood by the mention of those Words, these Words there∣fore
being used in our Discourse, and those Notions in our Ratiocinations,
must needs very much perplex the Operations of the Mind, and much puzzle
and disturb the Ratiocination. The Notions of the Mind therefore ought to
be stated aright, and the Signification of many words ought to be more de∣fin'd
divers new Words also to be made and set upon more distinct Conceptions
and Notions, and many other words ought to be wholly blotted out and rejected,
as either signifying something imperfectly, which is otherwise better exprest, or
else a Phantasm, for which there is no ground in Nature: Education also, Breeding,
Conversation and Instruction, do all of them very much work upon the Affection,
and serve to sway it this way or that way according to the Will of the Teacher,
whereby the Understanding becomes inslaved to the Dictates of Education, and
the Ratiocination bound up or fettered by the <HI>Placits</HI> of a Tutor, so as not to
be able to lay hold of Truth though never so fairly offer'd: For most of those
things being instilled into our Minds when young and tender, and incapacitated
to distinguish between Assertions and Demonstrations, and between Opinions
and Realities, have taken so deep a Root, and so possest the Mind with Preju∣dice
against many Ways and Methods of Truth, that they are not freed with∣out
very much Trouble and Circumspetcion; and 'tis a kind of Soveraignty
<PB N="11" REF="45"/>
which Men do most of all affect, to captivate and inslave Mens Minds to a
Reverence or good Opinion of their Abilities, and Doctrines; so that we have
not only a great many Enemies to Knowledge and Freedom, lodg'd within our
Breasts and Fabricks, but are every way encompassed; and those which seem
our greatest Friends, do in this regard prove our greatest Enemies.</P>
<P>And this Bond is so much the more difficult to be shaken off, if together with
their Doctrines we have entertain'd an Admiration, Awe, Reverence, or Esteem
of the Persons themselves that instructed us, or were the Authors of the Books
or Opinions we have approv'd. Add to all these Multitudes of false Opinions,
which have been impos'd upon our Belief by fallacious Demonstrations in Dis∣course
and Conversation: For Words being ill set Marks on very confused No∣tions;
the Reason of a Man is very easily impos'd on by Discourse, unless the
Mind be extreamly attent, and watchful, not to take any thing for granted,
that is not evidently prov'd, and very perspicacious in finding out the distinct
Notion of the Word, in every such Sentence, wherein it is used, for the No∣tions
signified by, some words being very many and very perplex, unless that
Notion there meant be (by some Periphrasis or otherwise) determine'd to be al∣ways
signified when that word is pronounced; the Circumspection of the In∣tellect
is so slow in examining over Particulars, and running over all the parti∣cular
Siginifications some words may have, that it may very easily be impos'd
upon by a quick and cunning Disputant, and being once impos'd on without
being detected, the Admission of that Error is the occasion of bringing in Mul∣titudes
of others; Error being a kind of Ferment which tends to the turning or
conforming all things to its own Nature, and like an infected Person has Influ∣ence
on all things it comes near.</P>
<P>The best Remedy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Remedy for these.</NOTE> for which Inconvenience, is not to consider so much what
the Person is that instructs, as how true the things are he asserts, nor of what Au∣thority
those Authors are esteem'd we read; but what Arguments are by them
brought for that which they assert, and if we are so over-born with Love, or
Reverence, to this or that Author, as to esteem of whatever he says, whether
right or wrong, than to imagine what he says to be spoken by one <HI>against</HI> whose
Person or Doctrine we have a Prejudice; for that will somewhat incline the
Mind to a contrary Opinion, and thereby help to ballance the Inclination of it
the better, so that it shall not reject Truth when offer'd on the one hand, nor
embrace an Error when asserted by the other.</P>
<P>Another way is to consider with what Vehemence and Earnestness two con∣trary
Opinions are believed and asserted on both sides, and to consider what are
or have been the occasions to incline the Parties to those Opinions or Doctrines
they maintain, and as near as may be to distinguish what manner of Actings
there are which proceed from Reason, and what from Prejudice, and from
thence to endeavour to fortify the Mind with Arguments against Dogmatical∣ness
and Opinionativeuess upon too small Grounds, and to accustom the Mind
to an Equilibrium or Indifferency, so as to be sway'd and turn'd to the embra∣cing
of Truth from whence or whomsoever brought.</P>
<P>A third way of remedying or rooting out Prejudices already impos'd on us,
and of preventing the like Impositions for the future; is an Hypothetical
Scepticism, whereby to impose upon our selves a Disbelief of every thing
whatsoever, that we have already imbraced or taken in as a Truth: And in so
doing, to throw out not only those things we may a little doubt of, but even all
those things of which we are most confident, and those especially which out
particular Constitutions seem most of all to incline us to believe, rejecting them
all as Impostures and Fallacies, that have by some indirect means or other crept
into our Understandings, or have been impos'd upon our Minds by some or other
that either wilfully or purposely endeavoured to deceive us, which having so
done by leasure and degrees, not too many at a time, by much Caution and
Circumspection, not without weighing well all the Arguments and Circum∣stances
that can be alledg'd either for or against them by many Tryals and Ex∣periments
and Siftings, to take such of them in again, distinctly and deter∣min'd
as can produce sufficient Evidence of Truth: Others, whose Truth we
cannot make out, to reject them in all our Ratiocinations as uncertain and of
doubtful Credit, and not to be relied on; till by farther Tryals or Experience
<PB N="12" REF="46"/>
the Truth or Falshood of them be made evident, and then accordingly to deal
finally with them by a Reception of them into the number or Truths, or a final
Rejection of them as Falsities and Errors.</P>
<P>The Second thing to be done, is the finding out the Perfections of our Na∣ture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">§. II. Of the Perfections of humane Na∣ture, and how they may be improved.</NOTE>
and the particular Helps we have for Information, and with what means
of Discovery we are furnisht, and how those Means may be improved. Now
the Faculties of the Soul are Three; Sense, Memory and Reason, or Ratiocina∣tion
the particular Business, of each of which is to be examined how far their
Ability and Power, when in the greatest Perfection extends, and wherein each
of them are deficient, and by what means the may be assisted and perfected.</P>
<P>The first therefore that will be necessary to this end,<NOTE PLACE="marg">First, As to the Senses their Exami∣nation, and how assisted.</NOTE> will be the Examination
of the particular Constitution of our Senses, to see what Propriety of a Body
each of them takes notice of, and how far they are capable of assisting in the
finding out of the Propriety, and wherein that Propriety of a Body does con∣sist,
where the Help of the Senses fails or leaves us in this Inquiry, and then
what Instruments will farther assist the Senses in this Inquiry, and how far also
their Power will extend, and by what means we may be farther assisted in this
Search.</P>
<P>The differing ways of Sensation we find to be Five, which are provided with
as may distinct Organs; the 1st. and most Spiritual is plac'd in the Eye, a 2d.
in the Ear, a 3d. in the Nose, a 4th. in the Mouth, the 5th. over the whole
Body.</P>
<P>The Fabrick of the Eye is most admirably contrived for receiving in the Im∣pression
of the Rays of Light,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sense of Seeing.</NOTE> and for so disposing and ordering of them, that
those Rays that proceed from the several Points of any Object that either emits
or reflects Light, and fall on the Cornea of the Eye, shall be all of them collected
into so many distinct Points at the bottom of the Eye, and that in the same Or∣der,
that the Points were scituated in respect of the Eye, but in lesser Propor∣tion,
according as the Object is farther removed in distance from the Eye, and
in a greater Proportion as the Object is nearer; so that the Picture or Repre∣sentation
of the Object in the sensible part, or bottom of the Eye, may accord∣ing
to Posture of Distance of it from the Cornea, be either less equal or
bigger than the Object it self: Whence were the Sense of distinguishing the
Parts of the Picture at the bottom of the Eye, as nice and particular as the Bo∣dy
has distinct Parts, we might very easily by this Sense only find out the Tex∣ture
or Schematism of any Body within our reach; for 'tis very easy by one
single Lens of a small Sphere, or of a very Convex Figure, plac'd just before
the Eye, to make the Object distinctly visible, when much nearer to the Cornea
than the Cornea is to the bottom of the Eye, and consequently the Rays crossing
near the Cornea, the Picture or Representation at the bottom must be bigger
than the Object it self; but the discerning Power of the Sense is not capable of
making Distinction so Parts when they are smaller than such a Bulk, the Ter∣minus
of which, I find to my Eye, to be when the Representation is about the
Bigness of the smaller Pores to Wood: Which I find by this Expedient, by a
convenient single Lens I bring the Object I look on so near my Eye, that the
crossing of Rays in the Eye may be about the middle Space between the visible
side of the Object, and the bottom of my Eye; from whence it follows, that
the Picture of the visible part of the Object is as big as the thing represented:
But the Eye being then at most but capable of seeing or distinguishing those
Pores; it follows, that (if the Cause of that Distinction be from the ends of
the Filaments of Optick Nerve, as <HI>Des Cartes</HI> ingeniously supposes) the Fi∣laments
cannot be smaller than the Microscopical Pores of Wood, and that the
Eye is uncapable of distinguishing the Parts of any Picture that are smaller than
those: So that any Object being so far removed from the Eye as to make the
Picture of it on the Retira less than a Microscopical Pore, that Object becomes
invisible, if a least it be but of a dull Radiation; for if it be otherwise of a
very bright Radiation, the whole Filament is mov'd by having one part of it
powerfully acted on, and so we have a Sensation of the Object, the same as if
it were much bigger, and this seems to be the reason why the Stars appear to
<PB N="13" REF="47"/>
our naked Eye many Thousand times bigger in bulk than really they are, and
even as big as through a long Telescope, which would not be if our Sense were
sufficiently fine and nice. I could have instanc'd likewise in the other Senses,
but this may suffice for an Example.</P>
<P>Having considered therefore the Power and Property of the Sense, we may
be so much the better inabled to find out its Defeats, and by what means it
may be improv'd.</P>
<P>The Eye therefore presenting to the Sense a Picture of the Objects that are
plac'd before it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What this Sense informs us off, and how its Defects may be helped.</NOTE> is capable of Informing of the Sense of Four or Five Qualities
of Bodies, first of the Radiation, or the shining or not shining Properties of Bo∣dies,
next of the Peliucidity and Opacousness of Bodies. 3<HI>ly,</HI> Of the Reflex∣iveness
of Bodies. 4. Of the Figure, Magnitude and Position of Bodies. 5. Of
the Motion; when therefore these Proprieties of Bodies are inquir'd after, the
Information concerning the three first must be wholly fetcht from this Sense,
but the Information concerning the other two may be had partly from this and
partly also from some of the other Senses. In the discovering of each of these
Properties, the Sense may be various ways assisted, both by Engines, Observa∣tions
and Experiments.</P>
<P>As First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st. It informs of the Radia∣tion of Bodies.</NOTE> for the discovering of the shining Properties of many Bodies, there
are these two more immediate Assistances; the first is by placing the Eye and
Object in such a place where all other Radiations of Light may be wholly ex∣cluded,
for by this means, many weak Degrees of Radiation will become vi∣sible
to the Eye, which in a greater Light would be altogether insensible, and
this proceeds from a Twofold Cause; First, because there is no stronger Im∣pression
made on the Eye from the Radiation of any other Object, which is the
reason why the Stars disappear in the day time: Next the Eye thereby opens
its Apperture much wider, and so admits a much greater number of Rays,
whence 'tis that the Eye by a long stay in a somewhat dark Room begins to
see and distinguish things almost as well as in a much lighter, because
the Apperture is not opened in an instant but by degrees. Hence the Radiation
of Gloworms Tails, of the Juice of the Hundred Legged Worm, of rotten Wood,
of Salt Water, of Putrifying Fish, of a rubbed or warmed Diamond, and the
like, becomes visible to the naked Eye in a dark Room, which disappears and
vanishes in a bigger Light, but because we find that the more Rays the Eye is
capable of collecting, the better is it able to discover this Propriety where it is
very languid; therefore if the Eye can by any Contrivance of Glasses be made
capable of collecting a much greater quantity of Rays from a Point, and ma∣king
them meet on the Retina, 'tis not improbable but that a much greater
number of Bodies may be discover'd Radiant than are yet suppos'd to be such,
perhaps also it may discover to us the Properties of many other Motions; for
it seems not improbable, but that the Motions of Corrosion in many Bodies
may generate some faint Degree of Light; perhaps also, the Motion of Fer∣mentation,
and many Degrees of Heat, much less than what we now esteem
requisite, may produce the like effect. And that this help of this Sense in this
Inquiry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">With some such Glasses it were very desirable that Tryal should be made with several Bodies in a per∣fectly dark Room, such as an unrubb'd or cold Diamond, with corroding Bodies, with fermenting Bo∣dies, and such as are treated by various o∣ther ways.</NOTE> is not a Supposition without any ground from the Nature of the thing,
will appear first in that Cats and Owls, and Bats, and divers other Creatures, are
able to see in a much less degree of Light than is sufficient for a Man's Sight.
Next from this, that making Tryal upon this very Supposition with a convenient
Lens, I have divers times been able to read in the Night by the help of it,
when I could hardly with my naked Eye distinguish the Lines. Now this be∣ing
done with an ordinary double Convex Spherical Lens, 'tis not improbable
but that much more may be done by a double Hyperbolical one, if the way
of making it can be found (which seems not altogether improbable to be done
with Niceness enough as to this use of collecting the Rays of Light, though in
Glass it be very difficult to be done accurate enough for distinct Vision) or by
the help of an Elliptical Concave, by placing the Body to be examin'd in one
of its Focuses, and the Eye with a Concave Lens before it in the other, and for
this use 'tis easy enough to make a Concave sufficiently accurate of an Ellipti∣cal
Figure.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="48"/>
Farther, If our Eyes should not be capable of being brought up to such a
Degree of Niceness in Sensation as is requisite; 'tis not impossible but that by
some Observations and Tryals, one may come to the Knowledge of the Truth
as to this Inquiry. 'Tis possible perhaps to find a way to discover whether a
Cat or some such other Creature can see by such a Light, which I think might
be many ways done, were it not much easier and more certain to make a Dis∣covery
with ones own Eyes, and that perhaps to as great, if not much greater
Degree of Nicety than Cats can.</P>
<P>There may perhaps also be found, upon farther Inquiry into the Nature of
things, some Body that is acted on or mov'd by Light, which is much more sen∣sible
of the Degrees thereof than the Eye, which, if found, would be a huge
Assistance to a diligent Inquirer into this Property of Body; and for this we
may have some reason to hope, if we consider, how lately 'tis that the Beard
of an Oat was found out for the Sensation of the Moisture or Dryness of the
Air: And 'tis not yet above—Years since I first discover'd the like, but
somewhat more nice Property in the Seeds of <HI>Geranium Moschatum: Athanasius
Kircher</HI> tells us, that the Sun-Flower follows the Light of the Sun, but whe∣ther
true or not, I dispute not now: Sufficient it is to the present Design (which
is only to hint by what ways possibly the Sense may be assisted) to shew that
such an Help is not altogether improbable to be found. Perhaps also the aug∣menting
the Bulk of such a Body, may make that Propriety become sensble
which might otherwise lie hid.</P>
<P>Next as to the Pellucidity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2dly, Of their Pellucidity.</NOTE> Colours, or Opacousness of Bodies, the Eye may
be various ways assisted in the finding out that Propriety and reducing its De∣grees
to a Measure or Standard. One way is, by placing the examining Eye in
a Room perfectly darkened, without any Cranny to admit Light into it, save
only one or two Holes; against one of which whilst the other is quite stop the
Body to be examin'd may be plac'd, of various Thicknesses according to its di∣stinct
Nature: The more transparent it be, the thicker Mass of Body may be
seen through, and the more opacous, the thinner must the plated Body be:
And by this Contrivance a great Number of Bodies will be found <HI>aliquatenus</HI>
transparent, which are judg'd wholly opacous, and by the Thinness, requisite
to admit a sensible Degree of Light through, may the comparative Opacity of
Bodies be found and determin'd.</P>
<P>A second way whereby the Eye may be assisted in this Inquiry, is by the Mi∣croscope;
for the Body being, by beating or otherwise, reduced into small
parts, the Microscope does plainly distinguish those Particles <HI>aliquatenus</HI> tran∣sparent.
Thus the parts of most sorts of Stones when reduc'd to Sand, appear
manifestly transparent, the most Metalline and other Colours used by Painters,
appear to consist of somewhat transparent Parts, and very many of those Bodies
which the Eye is not able to discover such the other way, is by this means
very eassily manifested; and indeed, there seems to be scarce any Body in Na∣ture,
unless perhaps some of the white Metaline that are not in some Degree or
other transparent, and this is so much the more probable; since we find that the
most compacted, we know in the World, namely Gold, is manifestly transpa∣rent,
when beaten very thin and held up against the Light.</P>
<P>Next, the Transparency, Opacity, or Colours of Bodies may be farther in∣quired
into, by mixing and incorporating several of them with divers sorts of
appropriated Homogeneous Transparent Bodies; that is, with such as with
whom they will readily mix. Thus Cochineel, which looks like an opacous
dark Body, when mixt with Water that dissolves it, yields a transparent Crim∣son
Colour. Thus Iron melted with Glass yields a kind of Red. Thus Copper
mixt or dissolv'd by some Saline Liquors yields a Green, with others a Blew,
with others a Purple. Thus many sorts of Stones and Earths, which seemed
before perfectly opacous, by this means shew their Colour.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3dly, Of their Reflexiveness.</NOTE> The reflecting Property of Bodies may be partly discover'd and di∣stinguisht
by the above-mention'd Methods, and partly also by reducing the Bodies
into the Shape of a Burning-Glass of a determinate Bigness, and smoothing the
Superficies of it very well; for by the comparing of divers of those Instruments
<PB N="15" REF="49"/>
so made, by the Effects of burning they produce when expos'd o the Sun, 'twill
not be difficult to determine the comparative Power of reflecting the Rays of
Light.</P>
<P>Another way of judging of the comparative Reflection of Bodies, may be by
viewing them in a Microscope in several Lights, and with several Apertures;
and by pitching upon some one Body to the Strength of the Reflection of which
the proportionate Reflection of all the rest may be referr'd; for by knowing the
Smalness of the Aperture of the Glass requisite to make each of them disappear,
we know also their comparative Power of Reflection.</P>
<P>Tryal also of this Property may be made with the Eye, only assisted with
several Apertures, and only finding the Smalness of the Aperture requisite to
make the Reflection of Light from such a Body to disappear.</P>
<P>The Use of which Inquiry into this Property of Bodies may be of very great
Use, as to the Invention of the Nature and Texture of Bodies.</P>
<P>Fourthly, As to the Magnitude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4thly, Of their Magnitude, Fi∣gure, and Po∣sition.</NOTE> Figure, and Position of Bodies, though the
Eye can pretty well guess at them in Bodies pretty near, and within its reach
as 'twere, yet beyond that, and even in that too if Accurateness be required;
it is deficient, and does much need the Help of Instruments and Contrivances to
assist it.</P>
<P>As to the Magnitude and Position of Bodies; the Eye may be assisted by ma∣king
Experiments with divers sorts of Mathematical Instruments, especially by
the Use of some which I shall afterwards describe, by which means the Mag∣nitude,
Distance, and Position of the Celestial Bodies, that are so far out of our
reach, may be much more accurately measur'd, than by any other sort of In∣strument
yet made publick to the World.</P>
<P>As for the Figure and Magnitude of some Bodies; the Eye (being unable to
distinguish the Position of Parts, when the Appearance of them is less than such
an Angle) may be assisted by two sorts of Instruments, namely the Telescope for
the appearing Figure of small Bodies, absent, and out of our reach; and the
Miscroscope for such minute Bodies as we have access to; the Melioration of
both which Instruments would be a Matter of huge Concernment, as to the
Resolution of this Inquiry. And I cannot doubt, but that the Industry of some
of the many Ingenious Men, that are now imploy'd about it, will be so suc∣cessful
as to accomplish it.</P>
<P>The Figures also of some, inaccessible Bodies may be judg'd by the Observa∣tion
of divers Circumstances: Thus the ingenious Monsieur <HI>Hygens</HI> discover'd
the true Figure of the Body of <HI>Saturn,</HI> which had so much puzled Learned
Men before.</P>
<P>Fifthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5thly, Of their Motion.</NOTE> The Eye may be various ways assisted for the Discovery of the Mo∣tion
and Velocity of Bodies; as by measuring the time it has past such a
length or space by the help of a Pendulum, and whereas the Motion of some
Bodies is so slow that their Velocity does not make a sensible Angle the Eye,
therefore the Velocity of such Motions is best gathered by Consequents, such
as all the Motions of the Celestial Bodies, many of which cannot be otherwise
discern'd.</P>
<P>The Internal Motions also of Bodies may be discover'd by various Effects,
such as those of Fermentation, Heat, Corruption, Generation, Growth, Decay,
Dissolution, Coagulation, and the like, from the accurate Observation of di∣vers
of which compared with several other Circumstances, may be very well
collected the Degree, Nature and Manner of Internal Motions.</P>
<P>The Telescope also and Microscope may much assist the Eye in this Inquiry;
thus the Body of the Sun has been found to vertiginate on its Axis. I did also
by the Help of a good Telescope, about two Years; since, discover the Motion
of ♃ about its own Axis, by means of a somewhat darker spot in the Body of
it; the Moon, ♄, and ♃ have also been found to have a Motion of Libration,
the Satellites of ♃ and Moon of <HI>Saturn</HI> to make their Periodick Revolution in
such or such a time. The Microscope also can make the Motion of the Legs
of Mites, and many other small Creatures sensible, as also the Motion of the
Hand of a Watch, and perhaps also Miscroscopes may be made so accurate as
<PB N="16" REF="50"/>
to discover the vegetating Motion of Plants (though I confess I have not yet
found the Growth of any so fast as to be quickly sensible through a Micro∣scope)
and of corrosive and corroding Liquors, and the like; however in the
search after every of these the Eye is not left without many Assistances, where∣by
it may perfectly discover what it seeks after.</P>
<P>Thus for the finding the Velocity and Strength of falling Bodies, I made this
following Contrivance, which succeeded according to Expectation.</P>
<P>The Instrument was thus contrived. See the 1st.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Description of the Instru∣ment for fal∣ling Bodies. Vid. the Fig.</NOTE> Figure in which ABC is the
Pedestal or Bottom to sustain the Scales and other Parts. DE a double Beam,
or two Beams well fastened together by cross pieces of Steel at the Ends,
of other ways, between the two Cheeks of which the Steel Ball F falls
from any determinate Height upon the Steel Plate or Basin G; and if by that
Fall it moves the double Beam and the Counterpoise H, lying in the Scale
IK, it gives the small Spring L a free Passage to slip between the end of the
double Beam and the Stay M, by which means there is given a certain Sign
whether the falling Body has moved the Scale or Counterpoise so far, as to ad∣mit
the very thin Edge of the Spring L, the rest of the Contrivance is obvious
enough from the Scheme it self. <HI>“That the Reader may the better understand
the Use and Performance of this Instrument, I have added some of the Experi∣ments
made with it, as I find them entered in the Registers of the Royal Society,
which I thought might not be unacceptable to the Ingenious.</HI> R. W.”</P>
<Q>The Account is as follows,</Q>
<P>“The Instrument being thus prepared, I. <HI>(i. e.</HI> Dr. <HI>Hook)</HI> put into the oppo∣site
Scale <HI>IK,</HI> a 4 Ounce Weight <HI>H</HI> that is four times the Weight of the Steel
Ball <HI>F,</HI> and letting this Steel Ball or Bullet <HI>F</HI> fall from just the Height of an
Inch above the Steel Plate <HI>G</HI> (by cutting the Thread that held it) I found is
very sensibly to move it; I repeated the Tryal so long, till I found that letting
this Ball fall but 4/21 of an Inch above the Plate, it would move the Beam so as
to admit the Spring; but if I let it fall from a less Height it would not, then
I put in 8 Ounces, and by several repeated Tryals, I found ⅔ of an Inch to be
the Height requisite for the falling Bullet to pass, before it would move 8 times
its own Weight, I proceeded farther, and from the Experiments collected in the
first Table <HI>A.</HI>”</P>
<P>“Afterwards I took a small Ball of Clay that was very ronnd, and exceeding
hard, in Weight near a quarter of an Ounce, and proceeding with this as I had
done with the Steel, I collected from the several Tryals the Second Table <HI>B.</HI>”</P>

<P>“The first row of Numbers in both which Tables shew the perpendicular Height
from which the Balls were let fall, to move the several Counterpoises which
are noted by the second Row of Numbers in both Tables, 4, 8, 16, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> signifying
the Counterpoise to be 4, 8, 16, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> times the Weight of the Ball.”</P>
<P>“Which Tryals and Observations, though they do not absolutely answer our
Expectation as to the thing sought, that a Body moved with twice the Celerity
acquires twice the Force, yet they serve for several good Uses; for first, it shews
us the Difficulty of such Tryals, where though all things as to ones Sense appeared
the same, yet some small insensible Circumstances made the Effects so differing,
that we need not wonder, if oftentimes when we endeavour to repeat an Experi∣ment
<PB N="17" REF="51"/>
delivered upon good Credit, as done by another with such or such Mate∣rials,
thus or thus us'd, though we do all things just according to Prescriptions,
yet we miss of producing the promised Effects. And therefore I conceive it not
less instructive to any one that may attempt to make a farther Discovery of
this kind, to shew wherein our present Tryals were deficient, than to declare
what they did.”</P>
<P>“Now the first and greatest Defect in our Tryals seems to be, that there is a
yielding in the Materials which we make use of; first, that part of the Ball which
first touches the Plain is a little flatted by the Knock, and consequently a part
of the Force is returned into the Ball, and so lost. Secondly, The yielding of the
Plate; thirdly, the stretching the Ears of the Plate, every one of which yieldings
must necessarily take off from the Force of the falling Ball, that it cannot work
the expected Effect so accurately as it would were those remov'd.”</P>
<P>“Next in this Contrivance, there is besides the Counterpoise of Weights, a
great deal of a massy heavy Body, namely, the double Beam, and the Plate, and
Scale; all which, or at least the greatest part of it, must be moved, and that
with a very quick and sudden Motion before the Spring, though it be so very
thin can get between the End of the Beam and Stay, to make the Effect sensible.
Now this quick Motion it self does require a considerable Strength to effect it,
were the Counterpoise remov'd; for such a Bulk of Body cannot be put into such
a quick Degree of Motion, but by another Bulk of Body mov'd with a determinate
Degree of Celerity.”</P>
<P>“Thirdly, The Scales and Counterpoise may be all mov'd, and yet the small
Spring, though it be so thin as not to be above 1/40 or 1/50 part of an Inch in Thick∣ness,
yet is that a Space, and the Beam may perhaps be moved half that way,
and the forcible Resistance of Gravity may make it return back again before it
have mov'd the whole Space, so that it may be moved a little, and yet not so
much as to make it sensible by this Contrivance. Nor would the making that
Spring thiner much mend the matter, since there are other Inconveniences: And
that this is so, I try'd the following Experiment, when in my last Tryal I had
found that the Ball of a quarter of an Ounce required to be let fall from the
Height of 36 Inches, before it would move the end of the Beam so much as to
let in the Spring, when there was 128 times its Weight of Counterpoise, that I
might try whether the same Ball would not sensibly move the same Counterpoise,
though it were let fall from a much smaller Height. I placed the Spring so as that
it was between the Stay and the end of the Beam, but not so far in as it would
spring in if it were left free; then letting fall the Ball at 4 Inches Height, I
found that it had moved the end sufficiently to let the Spring slide in as far as
it would, I put the Spring in Order as before, and let it fall from 3½ Inches
Height, and found it there likewise to move the end of the Beam.”</P>
<P>“I repeated it again at 3 Inches Height, but though I try'd several times, I could
not find that it had at all moved or let slip the Spring. Now as exact Tryals
of this kind may be very useful in Mechanicks, so could they be made with Bo∣dies
perfectly solid, would they be for the Establishment of one of the chief Prin∣ciples
of Philosophy, namely, the Strength a Body moved has to move another.
And though <HI>Des Cartes</HI> puts it as a Principle, that <HI>Si Corpus C plane qui∣esceret
essetq; paulo majus quam B, quacum{que} cum celeritate B moveretur
versus C nunquam ipsum C moveret, sed ab eo repelleretur in contrariam
partem,</HI> and gives this Reason for it, <HI>Quia Corpus quiescens magis resistit
magnae celeritati quam parvae, id{que} pro ratione excessus unius supra alteram.
Et idcirco semper major esset vis in C ad resistendum, quam in B ad impel∣lendum:</HI>
Yet these Experiments do rather seem to hint, that the least Body by
any acquir'd Celerity, may be able to move the greatest, though how much of its
Motion is imparted to the bigger Body, and how much of it is recoil'd into the
smaller be not hereby determin'd.”</P>
<P>But to proceed, I could thus have gone over all the other Senses, by examin∣ing
their particular Construction, and what Proprieties of Bodies they each of
them take Notice of, what Information they can afford us alone, and where
they leave us, and by what Instruments and Methods they might be helpt and
assisted in the Prosecution of the Inquiry. But these being more proper to be
<PB N="18" REF="52"/>
instanced in hereafter, when I come to give Examples of this Method for the
finding out of particular Inquiries, and my Business at present being only to
give a Specimen for the Explication of my Design, and as it is preparatory to
the finding out such Helps for the Senses for making Discoveries as may assist
a Natural Historian in the collecting of Materials for a Philosophical Supellex,
to fill up the Repository of the Memory withal; for the Ratiocination to work
on, for finding out the Causes, Manner, and Method of Nature's proceeding
in all those Operations, we inquire into. I shall now pass on to consider of
those other Faculties of the Soul, namely, Memory and Ratiocination. The
Business of the former being nothing else but a faithful Preservation of the
things committed to it, and a ready recollecting them when necessary, will be
rectified and perfected by this Method of the Philosophick Algebra, and the
rectifying and perfecting of the Reason, we shall refer to another Oppor∣tunity.</P>
<P>The second thing therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Part II.</HI> Of collecting the Phenomena of Nature, for the compiling an Histroy.</NOTE> is a Method of collecting a Philosophical Hi∣story,
which shall be as the Repository of Materials, out of which a new and
sound Body of Philosophy may be raised. This is to comprize a brief and plain
the Account of a great Store of choice and significant Natural and Artificial Opera∣tions,
Actions and Effects, ranged in a convenient Order, and interwoven here
and there with some short Hints of Accidental Remarks or Theories, of corre∣sponding
or disagreeing received Opinions, of Doubts and Queries and the like,
and indeed until this Repository be pretty well stored with choice and found
Materials, the Work of raising new Axiomes or Theories is not to be attem∣pted,
lest beginning without Materials, the whole Design be given over in the
middle, for out of this are to be taken like Foundation Stones, on which the
whole Structure should be raised, and those ought to be proportioned according
to the rest of the Materials; for otherwise there may follow great Inconvenien∣ces,
in prosecuting of it, here therefore ought to be laid up the more substan∣tial
Parts: But as for the most curious and precious things which may serve
for the finishing or compleating this grand Structure, they are to be sought for
as occasion shall require and prompt. For as in any great building, none can be
so perspicacious as to foresee every particular thing he shall need, for the com∣pleating
of it, but leaves the Care of providing them till occasions call for
them, as being then best able to judge which of that kind of Material which
is wanting will be most fitting for his purpose, and so with that proceeds till
other occasions call for other Requisites and Helps: And so from time
to time furnishes himself with those more choice things, as the Occasions require; so
there is none but before he sets upon such a Design, will be sure to provide
himself of a sufficient Store of such Materials as he knows altogether necessary,
nor will he neglect to lay hold on such things, as offering themselves by chance, put
him in mind that he shall have occasion for them before he can finish his Design;
and certainly much better it were, if the Architect were so skilful as to foresee
to provide all kinds of Materials before he begins; for thereby his Work would
be carried on the more compleatly and uniformly, without Necessity of pulling
down, or altering, or piecing, or transforming any part, or staying or inter∣rupting.</P>
<P>The Case is much the same in providing a proper History for the perfecting
of a new Body of Philosophy, the Intellect should first like a skilful Architect,
understand what it designs to do, and then consider as near as can be, what
things are requisite to be provided in order to this Design, then those Materials
are to be carefully sought for and collected, and safely laid up in so convenient
an Order, that they may not be far to seek when they are wanting, nor hard
to be come by when they are found: In the choice of which, Care ought to be
taken that they are sound and good, and cleans'd and freed from all those things
which are superfluous and insignificant to the great Design; for those do nothing
else but help to fill the Repository, and to incumber and perplex the User, yet
notwithstanding, Brevity is not so much to be studied, as to omit many little
Circumstances which may be considerable in the use of it, for as in the laying
up of Timber, the keeping on a branching part does make it serviceable for
many Designs which it would be wholly unfit for, if it had been squared off,
so it will be in the fitting and preparing the Particulars for a Philosophical Hi∣story,
<PB N="19" REF="53"/>
there must be Judgment in the Historian to discern what will be material
and useful in general, and what will be more especially adapted for the In∣quiry
whatever he designs.</P>
<P>This Similitude therefore hints unto us the whole Method of making a Phi∣losophical
History, according to which, I shall enumerate the several things ne∣cessary
to this Design, and according to my Ability, endeavour to explain each
Particular in such Order, and so far forth as to me seems most natural and con∣sonant
to my present Purpose. But first I shall premise some of the Accom∣plishments
requisite for a Natural Historian.</P>
<P>There seem therefore these Requisites to accomplish one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">§ 1. Of the Requisites in a Natural Hi∣storian.</NOTE> that intends to
prosecute or do any thing considerable in this Work, without which the Col∣lections
may very much fail of the desirable Excellency in this or that Particu∣lar,
though perhaps as to the kind they may contain many good things.</P>
<P>The First is, That he ought to be very well skill'd in those several kinds of
Philosophy already known, to understand their several Hypotheses, Supposi∣tions,
Collections, Observations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> their various ways of Ratiocinations and
Proceedings, the several Failings and Defects both in their way of Raising, and
in their way of managing their several Theories: For by this Means the Mind
will be somewhat more ready at guessing at the Solution of many Phenomena
almost at first Sight, and thereby be much more prompt at making Queries, and
at tracing the Subtilty of Nature, and in discovering and searching into the true
Reason of things; and though perhaps none of those Methods of Philosophy
he has been accustomed to, may any way direct him in the Contrivance of this
New Fabrick, yet 'tis with the Exercises of the Mind as with the Operations of
the Body; one that has been bred up, and well skill'd in any Trade, shall go
much more readily and handily about it, and make a much better piece of Work
of a quite new Design in that Trade, than one that has not been at all us'd to
such kind of Operations; there must be a time to bring and fix the Mind to a
Regard and Heedfulness of this kind of Contemplation, and a time also to ac∣custom
it to Meditation and Contrivance, and a time to acquaint it with ratio∣nating
from material Observations before it can go about such a Design dexte∣roussly.
Besides this also, the Mind will, by being acquainted with various Con∣jectures
and Solutions of things, be much sooner and better freed from Preju∣dice;
for by discovering experimentally the Errors in this or that Hypothesis,
'twill be much easier taken off from adhering to any, and so enjoy a greater
Freedom of perceiving and imbracing Truth from what occasion soever it be
offered.</P>
<P>Next, As he ought to be knowing in Hypotheses, so ought he also to be ve∣ry
well furnished with those things, which will most assist the Mind in making,
examining, and ratiocinating from Experiments. And these are chiefly two,
Mathematicks and Mechanicks; the one somewhat more speculative, the other
more practical: The one qualifying the Mind with a most exact Idea and Pat∣tern
of Ratiocination, Demonstration, Invention, and Detection: The other ac∣quainting
and instructing it with the Processes of Action, and Operation. He
ought first of all, and chiefly to be very well skill'd in Geometry and Arithme∣tick,
the more demonstrative Parts, and Algebra the more inventive Part of it:
And this not only, as it furnishes the Mind as it were with Numbers, Weights,
and Measures to inquire into, examine and prove all things; but as it also in∣structs
and accustoms the Mind to a more strict way of Reasoning, to a more
nice and exact way of examining, and to a much more accurate way of inqui∣ring
into the Nature of things: The other more Physical Parts of Mathematicks are
also very useful in their kind, shewing a Way and Method of applying the for∣mer
to Physical Uses and Inquiries. Mechanicks also being partly Physical, and
partly Mathematical, do bring the Mind more closely to the Business it designs,
and shews it a Pattern of Demonstration, in Physical Operations, manifests the
possible Ways, how Powers may act in the moving resisting Bodies: Gives a
Scheme of the Laws and Rules of Motion, and as it were enters the Mind into
a Method of accurate and demonstrative Inquiry and Examination of Physical
Operations. For though the Operations of Nature are more secret and abstruse;
<PB N="20" REF="54"/>
and hid from our discerning, or discovering of them, than those more gross and
obvious ones of Engines, yet it seems most probable, by the Effects and Cir∣cumstances;
that most of them may be as capable of Demonstration and Re∣duction
to a certain Rule, as the Operations of Mechanicks or Art. And from
those, which are yet somewhat more speculative, he ought to proceed to ac∣quaint
himself with others more complicated Mechanical Operations: Such as
Chymical, and the Physical, yea even divers Mechanical Operations in many
other Trades: For by these Ways, he will be better acquainted and enabled how
to deal with Nature, for the procuring and getting more hidden Jewels and
greatest Mysteries. But this is not yet enough, for the way to acquire these
things certainly is not as yet fully discovered, much less has it been practised,
he cannot have a Pilot to direct him certainly, to shew the Course, and
describe all the Turnings and Windings, and Shoalds, and many other Diffi∣culties
that are to be met withal, in this Attempt: Most of these things must
be left to his own prudent and wary Management of his own Designs.</P>
<P>And, as <HI>Columbus</HI> did in the Discovery of the New World of <HI>America,</HI> he
ought to contrive his Design well; then to procure what Helps and Assistances
he is able, lastly, thoroughly to prosecute it, and not be discouraged by the
many Crosses and ill Successes he may at first chance to meet with in the At∣tempt,
and afterwards also in the Prosecution thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Therefore being thus well provided, he ought very thoroughly and
seriously to consider of his Design; and this he should do first by proposing to him∣self
the end of his Inquiry; then by considering from the Nature of the Inquiry,
what things seem most likely to be conducive thereunto, and accordingly to set
down those things as <HI>quaesita</HI> or Requisites; then further to consider well, and
contrive by what means each of these Properties may be attain'd, <HI>viz.</HI> By what
Experiments or Observations, what Engines, and Contrivances are necessary,
and how to be used: And for this end it is altogether necessary, that he be
able to design and draw very well, thereby to be able both to express his own
Ideas the better to himself, to enable him to examine them and ratiocinate up∣on
them himself, and also for the better informing and instructing of others;
for there are many things which cannot be made as plain to the Understand∣ing,
by a large Description in Words, as by the Delineation of them in a quar∣ter
of a Sheet of Paper. Drawing therefore is not only necessary in point of In∣vention
of Mechanick Contrivances and Demonstrations, but for the Registring
Particulars, and compiling a desirable History. Next, Having contrived his
Methods of Examination, he ought to prosecute them with great Diligence and
Judgment, in ordering, using, and deducing from them.</P>
<P>4<HI>thly,</HI> In the Prosecution of each of which, he ought to proceed with the
greatest Degree of Candor and Freedom from Prejudice, not to be by assed by
this or that Opinion in making of Deductions, nor by the Pleasantness or Gain∣fulness
of the Experiment, or any other by Consideration that does not imme∣diately
look at the present Discovery he is searching after; for though those
things are not to be wholly neglected, but rather mark'd by the by, and <HI>in tran∣situ,</HI>
yet the Mind is not to dwell upon them, or look otherwise after them,
than as they are conducive to the present Inquiry, as they manifest a Truth or
discover an Error, left like sweet singing Syrens they seduce their Followers
out of their right way to their utter Destruction. He ought also to proceed
with the greatest Circumspection and Diligence to find out such things, as are
Indications of what he seeks, and from those to take Incouragement to prose∣cute
his Intentions, as <HI>Columbus</HI> did from the decreasing Depth of the Sea, the
Drift of Weeds on the Surface of the Water, and the White Clouds that ap∣pear'd
near the Horizon, and the like to incourage and direct him in his
Course.</P>
<P>5. He ought to get what Help he can from others to assist him in this his Un∣dertaking;
for 'tis to be expected from the single Endeavours of any one
Man, though there most accomplisht, that any great Matter should be done,
Man's Life will be well near half spent, before he can be fit to undertake this
<PB N="21" REF="55"/>
Work, and 'twill be a long time afterwards, before a sufficient Supellex can be
gathered by his single Endeavours: Besides, there is much of Expence requisite,
which every one cannot so well bear, that may perhaps be otherwise fit for this
Employment; he must therefore here also imitate <HI>Columbus,</HI> endeavour to be
provided with Ships, and Men, and Money, and all those Assistances he finds
requisite for the thorough Prosecution of this Discovery.</P>
<P>6. <HI>Lastly,</HI> He ought, as <HI>Columbus</HI> did freely and impartially to discover
what he finds; but yet with particular and more especial Regard to the great
Promoters and Benefactors of this Design; and what Assistances he has receiv'd
he ought candidly to acknowledge: And whatsoever he registers, he ought to
do it in the plainest, shortest, and most significant Description, the Matter is
capable of, and in such a Method as may neither cause Repetition of History,
in more places than one, nor the Rejection of some others, because it fits not
punctually to his Method: He ought likewise to own what Information any
one has contributed toward the compiling of such a History; and to be as care∣ful
that he be not impos'd on, either by the Ignorance or Deceit of such as seem
to be assisting.</P>
<P>The next thing to be considered is, what the Subject of his Enquiry is; which
I shall endeavour to explain, by setting down the General Scheme of the whole
Matter, about which a Philosophical History is to treat.</P>
<P>And this is not of less extent than the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">§II. The Subject of Philoso∣phical History in general.</NOTE> there is no Body or Opera∣tion
in the Universe, at least if it can be way brought to our that Knowledge,
is not some way or other to be taken notice of in this Great Work, the
most precious are here not more considerable, nor perhaps so much as the most
trivial and vile. Every thing is here to be taken notice of only as it is lucriferous
or conducive to the Discovery of Truth, and for a while at least the Lucriferous∣ness
of any that occurs (unless for the Cause of encouraging others in the Search)
is to be omitted; lest thereby the Mind be diverted before it have gone through
with its first Undertaking. Nor though the Volumes requisite to be filled
with this kind of History be many, and so may seem to confound the Mind
with the very thought of making use, or examining over the Particulars there∣in,
and much more with the thought of compiling and collecting them; yet if
we consider but the Volumes that are already writ on Subjects that have much
less of Reality, and those perhaps by some one Man, and the Volumes he has been
fain to tumble and search over for the collecting of the Matter contain'd in them,
besides the Multitude of Thoughts and Perplexities of Mind in spinning out
Niceties and ranging them, we may find the Labour and Perplexities of these
Collections of real things, nothing comparable for Difficulty to those of Fiction,
and Imagination; for I have very good Reason to believe, that the whole Mass
of Natural History, may be contain'd in much fewer words than the Writings
of divers single Authors: And the Method of using them will be much more
easy, and the Labour of interpreting or understanding them, if done aright,
will be almost as easy as to unravel a Bottom when you begin at the right end.
The Method of distributing the Matter of Philosophical History, both for ma∣king
Heads of Inquiry, and consequently also of registring them, need not be
very nice or curious, they being in them laid up only in Heaps as it were, as
in a Granary or Store-House; from thence afterwards to be transcribed, fitted,
ordered and rang'd, and Tabled, as I shall afterward explain to be made fit
for Use; for (as I instanced before) a sufficient store of sound and good Mate∣rials,
ought to be collected before the Work of Superstructure can be begun.</P>
<P>We will divide the whole Business of Philosophical History into these parti∣cular
Heads of Inquiry, in which we have not so much proceeded according
to the Nature of the things themselves, as according to their Appearance or
Respect to us: For though the Earth, in Comparison of the Heavens, be as it
were a Point, yet in Relation to its Nearness and Sensibleness to us, it becomes
much more considerable, and the Consideration of it and its Parts will take up
the greatest Part of this History. We will divide the Subject of Philosophical
History into two Parts; to wit, into things Natural and things Artificial.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="56"/>
Natural things may according to their Respects to us, be distinguished into
containing or cotain'd Bodies; the great containing Body we call Aether, in this
may be consider'd either its Magnitude and Figure; or its Parts: Or its Mo∣tions:
Or its Mixtures: Or the things contain'd by it. These last are either
Comets, or Planets, or Stars, the Planets we yet know of are either Primary
or Secundary; the Primary are these ☿, ♀, the Earth, ♂, ♃, ♄, the Secun∣dary
are the Moon, the Satellites of ♃ the Lunal of <HI>Saturn.</HI> All these, saving
the Earth, being remov'd much out of reach, may be compriz'd under one only
Head; but of the Earth being nearer to us, we may consider its Parts. By the Earth
I understand, all the Bodies contain'd within the Compass of the Atmosphere:
In the Atmosphere therefore being that which contains the rest, we may consider
either its Figure Extent, its Parts its Mixtures, its Motions, the things it con∣tains:
These last are either greater or less, the greater are the two great Masses of
Body, of which the Earth is made up, Namely, Water and Earth; the lesser are
Animals. Animals are Insects, Birds, Beasts, Men: In the Water we may
consider either its Figure and Extent, its Parts, its Mixtures, its Motions. The
things contain'd, these, are either Vegetables or Animals; Vegetables softer,
and stony Animals, Insects, Fishes, Beasts. In the Earth we may consider its
Magnitude and Figure, its Parts, its Mixtures, its Motions, the things it con∣tains;
these may be Metals. Plants, Mushrooms, Mosses, Herbs, Shrubs,
Trees, from which Consideration of the Matters of which History is to be writ∣ten,
might be collected Tables or Heads for Inquiry; but because these might
seem Dogmatical, and thereby be offensive to some, and might seem to savour
of Prejudice, or favour to the <HI>Copernican</HI> Hypothesis, which I have been endea∣vouring
to provide against; I shall make choice of this following Distribution,
which is made only according to the Appearance of things.</P>

being exactly determin'd, will hugely facilitate all the other Inquiries

are here placed in the Second Place; yet they were primarily and chiefly to be
regarded; for the Knowledge of these, will extreamly rectify the Mind both in
propounding Queries, and also in making Examinations aright, for the Nature

<P>In the writing of all which Histories there may be two things design'd, either
a Description of the things themselves, whereby Inquisitive Persons that are
ignorant of them, may come to a more perfect Knowledge of them; in order to some other
Design as for Curiosity, or Discourse, or Profit, and Gain, or
the like: Or such a Description of them as is only in order to the Use of Philo∣sophical
Inquiry, for the Invention of Causes, and for the finding out the ways
and means Nature uses, and the Laws by which she is restrain'd in producing
divers Effects.</P>
<P>And this last is that which is chiefly aim'd at in this Design (though others
also whose Intensions are only of the former kind, may find much to satisfy
<PB N="27" REF="61"/>
their Desires) for these being known and applied, not only the Reasons of the
ways already made use of in several Trades might be easily known: But each
of them highly amended and improved, and by other ways performed with
much more Ease, Speed and Certainty.</P>
<P>In the History therefore of Trades, we are chiefly to look after the Physical
Proprieties of each, as what is hard or soft, what flexible or stiff, what sharp,
corrosive, what odoriferous, balsamick and preservative, what putrifactive and
corruptive, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> together with the manner of applying Agents to Patients, and
to observe the manner of Natures proceeding, where she is impos'd on by Art,
and limited to this or that Degree, and not suffer'd to act otherwise, by what
Ways she may be assisted, accelerated, regarded, stopt; and the like, in her
usual Proceedings; for these being known, most of the other things will be
very easy and follow of course. We ought also, to take notice of the various
sorts of Mechanical Engines, which serve to assist and direct the hand in per∣forming
may Operations together, with Ease and Speed and certainty: which
are not otherwise done without much Uncertainty, Time, and Difficulty; and
of the several Slights and Contrivances in Operations, and the order of them,
which precede and which follow, and the Efficaciousness of them in this or
that Method.</P>
<P>Besides these Trades I have been mentioning, there are many excellent Ex∣periments
and Secrets to be found scattered up and down in Mens Practises,
which have not come up to that Considerableness in the Commonwealth as to
be made a Trade, which yet contain in them divers Circumstances of very ex∣cellent
Use and Information, those also ought to be sought out and collected and
rang'd into their proper Places, if at least they can properly be referr'd to any of the
foregoing Heads, otherwise they are to make a particular Head of themselves:
Of this kind there are a multitude almost in all Estates and Conditions of Men,
which to this Design will be of huge Importance, and will afford very much
Information, even out of the most vile and seemingly most foolish and trivial
things, and of those which are most common, and therefore pass without regard,
because usual, may be collected things of most excellent Use; and therefore,
nothing in this Design is to be look'd on with the Eye of the Vulgar, and with
Prejudice, according to the Esteem it has obtain'd in the World with the Gene∣rality
of Men, who generally judge or esteem of things only for the immediate
Pleasure or Profit they afford, and look no further; therefore 'tis not equal to
make their Esteem who understand them, the Standard of the value of things
for this use. So that a diligent Naturalist can go no-where, but he may find a
Subject for him to contemplate and examine, but especially in such Places as
are most or least frequented, for the Obviousness in the one, and Difficulty in
the other, has made Multitudes of considerable Observations to be neg∣lected.</P>
<P>Having thus cursorily summ'd up the chief Heads of those things that are fit
to be the Subject of Natural History,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>§ III.</HI> The Mo∣thods of ma∣king the En∣quiries.</NOTE> I shall next adjoyn a Specimen of what
things are to be inquired after in them, that so any other that shall have an
Opportunity, and willing to promote this Design, may accordingly, whatever
the thing be he designs to write a History of, first propound to himself the
things, which upon a serious Consideration of the Matter, he shall judge to be
most likely to be instructive for the discovering of the true Nature of that
which he inquires into.</P>
<P>For it cannot be expected, that any one should be alike able to make Queries
of those things in which he has not been much, if at all conversant; as one that
has had an Opportunity of acquainting himself more particularly with the Na∣ture
of it, and has imbib'd in (though he knows not how) a great deal of im∣perfect
Knowledge of the Proprieties of it. He ought therefore to consider
with himself, what things there are in the Subject he would inquire into, which
being told him, he should be able to know the true Propriety, Nature and
Texture of it: And supposing he had met with some one that could resolve
him, what Questions he would ask him, by the Resolution of which he should
be able to find out what he seeks; and accordingly he ought to set down those
Questions in Writing, that so he may have a Scheme before his Eyes what are
the things he looks after, what his Scope and Aim is.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="62"/>
And having set down these Queries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of an∣swering the Queries.</NOTE> he ought in the next place to consider what
things seem requisite to attain those ends; what means he can imagine may be
conducive to the solving or answering those Questions, that is, what Observations,
Examinations, or Experiments would seem conducive thereunto, and accordingly
under every such Query or Question, he ought to set down the things requisite to
be known for the obtaining the full Knowledge of a compleat and full Answer to
it; afterwards with Care and Diligence he ought to make Examination and Try∣al
of what he has propounded, one thing after another, with much Circumspection,
for accordingly as these Queries are made with more or less Judgment, and as
the means conducive to the Resolution of them are more judiciously pitcht on,
and diligently try'd more or less considerable, so will the Particulars to be en∣tred
in the Diary be; and the more or less useful for a Philosophical Treasury.
In the making of which Experiments and Tryals, it were very desirable that the
Inquirer would first make Tryal of them once all over, and observe diligently
and enter into a Paper by themselves as many Particulars as he can discover
worth noting, and then a second time to make them over again. In the doing
of which, it would be very convenient to get some such Person to be present
as has not been acquainted with Experiments on that Subject, though ingenious
and inquisitive in other Physical Searches, because such a Person may take no∣tice
of many Particulars which are in themselves very observable, but were and
would still have been neglected because of their being obvious, and because the
Inquirer having been long accustomed to the seeing of them without thinking
them any ways considerable, will be now very prone to do as formerly, slight
and neglect them, and this will be instructive to him in shewing him in
what things he is most likely to be overseen in, as well as shewing him the
things themselves. The Tryal of these Experiments, 'tis very likely, will much
further his Knowledge, and shew him perhaps the Solution of some of his
Queries, as well as the Error and Insignificancy of others; and may perhaps
much better instruct him how to make his second Class of Queries, and how
to proceed in the solving and answering them, they will not only facilitate the
Labour of making and accustome his Mind to a greater Circumspection, but
will suggest also various ways of examining and experimenting, which without
this Method of inquiring would not have been thought of.</P>
<P>And though indeed the Multitude of Queries that may be made upon every
Subject, may seem to make this Work infinite and impossible to be completed,
yet if Men would but prosecute thoroughly, according to the ways I propound
in this Tract, such kind of Inquiries in order to the Discoveries of the Pro∣prieties
of some Bodies, or for finding out the Nature of some general Qualities.
I cannot doubt but that such Endeavours would produce so considerable Disco∣veries,
as would not only serve for the Explication of that one Body inquir'd
into, but of Multitudes of Bodies of the like Nature; and every such Inven∣tion
will ease the Inquiries in most other Bodies, half in half, after the same
Propriety. As to give an Instance propounding to my self to find out the Rea∣son
of the Lightness of Cork.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Example of the Method.</NOTE> I set down among other ways of Tryal to exa∣mine
the Texture of it with a good Microscope, hoping that possibly I might
thereby be able to discover its Texture, to this end I examin'd several Pieces of
Cork, whose sides I had cut very smooth with a Razor, but the glaring Refle∣ction
from the Multitude of sides that compose its Surface made me unable,
though I try'd it in several Lights to discern any kind of Pores, I bethought
me therefore of shaving off a very thin Sliver of Cork, and laying it on a black
Ground, I could with my Microscope then plainly perceive the Texture of its
Substance, that it was as porous as a Honey-comb; that is, all over full of
small long Pores, upon and down, through the length of which were inter∣spers'd
many cross Diaphragms, or Valves, by which means the Air is impri∣son'd
in very curious close Boxes. Finding these in Cork, I proceeded to find
the same in Wood, not doubting but the Lightness of that might proceed from
some such Cause, I made tryal with Wood both green and dry, shav'd after the
same way, but in green Wood it succeeded not at all, but I could perceive di∣vers
larger up and down the dry. I conceived therefore, that it might be the
Juice of the Plant which had fill'd those Holes, and therefore considering that in
<PB N="29" REF="63"/>
Charcole all that superfluous Juice is wasted, and evaporated, I made tryal of
viewing a Coal in a Microscope, and even beyond my Expectation, I could dis∣cover
such Multitudes of them and so small, that I could hardly at first believe
my own Eyes, till trying the Experiment over and over again, I found the same
Propriety was not only to be found in one or two other kinds of Wood, but
was common to all sorts of Vegetables that I was able to charr.</P>
<P>Thus the Experiment of <HI>Saccharum Saturni,</HI> by dissolving Lead in an acid Li∣quor,
and evaporating away the watery part, will hint to us a way of disco∣vering
the Tastes of all kinds of Bodies; that is, by dissolving those reserved
and tasteless Bodies, in some convenient <HI>Menstruum,</HI> for being once dissolv'd,
it becomes dissoluble also, by the Vehicle of that <HI>Menstruum,</HI> to the <HI>Saliva</HI> or
Juice in the Mouth, or Tongue which seems to be the Organ of Taste.</P>
<P>Thus the finding out the Cause of Fluidity, Heat, Gravity, Brittleness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in
one Body, will much facilitate the Inquiry after the like Properties in any other
Body, so that though indeed upon every specifick Body to be examin'd, there
may be a Multitude of Queries propounded, yet the more praeceeding Bodies
have been by this Method examin'd, the fewer of them will there remain to
be answer'd.</P>

the rising of new Vapours, or from, the flowing in of the Air from other Cli∣mates,
or from the Motion of the Earth, Moon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>What are the Motions of the upper Parts of the Air, whether in the same
way, and with the same Velocity with the lower part of the Atmosphere, why
the Clouds that are plac'd one higher than another in several Regions and Sta∣tions,
are sometimes observ'd to go various ways at the same time, and none of
them perhaps the same way with the Wind below.</P>
<P>Whence the Air is able to bear up the Clouds that seem denser Bodies, whe∣ther

of Opacousness.</P>
<P>Hence the Air is able to carry up Smoke, Dust and several bulky Bodies that
are manifestly heavier, and why most apt in Summer when 'tis most expanded,

<P>These few Instances, I hope, may serve for a Specimen of what I mean by
the Method of propounding Queries on any Subject, to be examined by accu∣rate
Observations and Tryals, before the Writing a Natural History of it.</P>
<P>After the Queries have been thus propounded and ranged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">§ 4th. The Me∣thod of answer∣ing the Enqui∣ries.</NOTE> the next thing will
be to consider what Materials are to be got for the solving of them, and an
swering our Doubts, what Histories and Observations from abroad, and what
Experiments, Observations and Tryals at home will be necessary to be obtained
and made: What Instruments, Engines, and Contrivances, will be assisting to
this End; how far the Senses themselves will help us, and where they leave us
to seek other Helps, and this a serious and unprejudiced Meditation, and consi∣dering
of the Nature of the thing will best hint. And accordingly we ought to
set down under each Queries, what means can be thought of for resolving and
answering of them, which Tryals and Ways ought to be prosecuted from begin∣ning
to end vigorously, with Diligence and Accurateness, and to be Registered
as fast as made, that no considerable Circumstance may be forgotten. And al∣ways
<PB N="34" REF="68"/>
upon tryal as things occur, that seem to be assisting towards the solving
of another Query, than they were intended for; they ought to be registered
under that, as an additional Help of solving that Doubt, for the Memory is
frail, and may quickly forget even those things that are of most Importance,
and does not without much Labour and Trouble at best, recal all Circum∣stances
that are considerable at the time when they are most requisite. By this
Method also the imperfections of History will be amended. And tho' indeed
this Process of Reasoning and Inquiry may seem nothing else but what every
Man would do, and does indeed continually practise in all kinds of Inquiry:
Yet has it this vast Advantage above the common way, where the bare Powers
of the Senses, Memory and Understanding are relied upon, that it perfects
these Faculties to the highest pitch they are capable of, and that is indeed as
much as can be hoped for from Art: Every thing being here reduced to Regu∣larity,
Certainty, Number, Weight, and Measure; for whereas in the com∣mon
ways of Ratiocination, Examination and Inquiry, all things are trusted to
the immediate Power of the Faculties of the Soul, <HI>viz.</HI> the bare Senses, Memo∣ry
and Reason; in this they are none of them left, without their Armour, En∣gines
and Assistants, the Senses are helped by Instruments, Experiments, and
comparative Collections, the Memory by writing and entering all things, rang∣ed
in the best and most Natural Order; so as not only to make them material
and sensible, but impossible to be lost, forgot, or omitted the Ratiocination
is helped first, by being left alone and undisturbed to it self, having all the
Intention of the Mind bent wholly to its Work, without being any other ways
at the same time imployed in the Drudgery and Slavery of the Memory, either
in calling particular things to Memory, or ranging them in Order, or remem∣bring
such things as belong to another Head, or in transposing, jumbling, rang∣ing,
methodizing, and the like; for first all things are set down in their Order,
the ultimate End, the intermediate and other Ends that are aimed at in order
to the great one, the Steps and Ways that lead to each of these, then Engines
and Helps are propounded; the Progress, that has been made and the Distance
to come, is plainly to be seen for all things are registred in their due Order, as
fast as made.</P>
<P>Next it is not troublesome to find what thing is to be done in the next place,
the way of proceeding is chalked out, nor will the Mind be much troubled to
run over all the particular Instances and Heads of Inquiry, they are all pre∣sented
at once to the View: Their Order, Congruity, Disagreement, Simili∣tude,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> are all manifest to the Eye, quickly to be examined, recollected, re∣viewed,
otherwise placed, blotted out, or the like, according to occasion, and
nothing need be forgotten or omitted, or put in a false Order, if but a small
parcel of Diligence be made use of.</P>
<P>The last thing therefore is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The means of Collecting Ob∣servations.</NOTE> to consider of the means of collecting Observa∣tions,
and making such Experiments as seem likely to determine the Inquiry,
either Negatively or Affirmatively, either in part or totally, from whence these
Materials are to be collected, and by what means? For according to the choice
of the Experiments, such most usually is the Information. Such Experiments
therefore wherein Nature is as 'twere put to Shifts and forc'd to confess, ei∣ther
directly or indirectly the Truth of what we inquire are the best if they
could be met with: But these being hard to find at the beginning, it will be
best to be first a little acquainted with the Method of Nature, in her most evi∣dent
Manifestations of her self, to follow her meerly upon the Light of com∣mon
Observations and Experiments, such as are very obvious upon that Subject,
till we are somewhat acquainted with the ways she seems most inclined to fol∣low,
and so by degrees can follow her closer and closer at the heels, for by this
means we may be able to guess where she begins to make a Deflexion out of
her common Road; which way her Paths lie, at least whereabouts we lost her,
and were able to follow her no longer with our bare Senses: And there we
ought to make use of the Helps of our Senses, of Microscopes and Telescopes,
for the discovering the minute Figure of divers kinds of Liquors and Menstruums;
for discovering latent Tastes: Of Thermometers and Hygroscopes for discover∣ing
Degrees of Heat and Cold, Dryness and Moisture, and other tangible Qua∣lities
which our Senses are unable to distinguish: Of exact Scales, weighing in
<PB N="35" REF="69"/>
Water, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for comparative Gravity, and Expansion of Bodies: Of Baroscopes,
for Gravitation and Pressure of the Parts of Fluids one upon another: And se∣veral
other Contrivances which a good Mechanist will easily invent upon
occasion, as the Subject suggests: By which the informations of the Senses may
be advanced and more certainly determined.</P>
<P>By these means are to be searched out the Properties of Bodies, whereof the
History is to be written, and where we can find no farther ways of proceeding
to deeper Searches, and Nature seems to leave us in the Lurch, or pass away by
unseen Paths, there ought to be set up as it were a Land-mark
to direct us where to begin again to search, if making Tryal in one way we find our selves
mistaken, and thus we may a second or third if possibly we can by any means
light upon such Experiments or Observations, as may inable us to guess which
way she was most likely to take; but if upon Tryal we find it to be a business
of much greater Difficulty, the Progress how far we have gone is to be regi∣stered,
and the <HI>non ultra</HI> together with it, and so that kind of Inquiry may be
laid by for a time, till somewhat more of the secret Workings of Nature are
learnt from some other Prosecutions of her, in other ways, for Nature is so ve∣ry
subtle and reserved, that there will need a very great Stock of Patience as
well as Skill to be able to discover her Paths and Methods.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An instance in the Cause of Expansion.</NOTE> As in inquiring
after the Adequate Cause of Expansion, we find that most Bodies as well
fluid as solid, Metals, Quick-silver, Stones, Glass, Water, Spirit of Wine,
Oyle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are expanded by Heat, but finding also that the contrary Quality to
Heat, Namely, intense Cold does produce the same Effect as that Water fro∣zen
into Ice is more rarified than the Water: We are here at a loss to find what
way Nature should take with two quite contrary Agents, to bring forth the
same Effect, here therefore we set up a Mark, and make an Attempt to find
what way Expansion is perform'd by Cold, we find that most Ice when exa∣min'd
is all over besprinkled with disseminated Bubbles; till we have traced
Nature a little farther, we inquire therefore, whether Nature has not taken
that way of rarifying that Body, but we may find that even those pieces of Ice
which through the best Microscope is perfectly clear and free from those small
Bubbles, has a greater Expansion than the Water out of which it was frozen,
because it will swim in it, and next because that the Refraction. of Ice is less
than the Refraction of Water. This last seems to hint that Nature has taken
this way of making Ice lighter than the common Water, by precipitating a
grosser or heavier part of the Water to the Bottom, and by collecting the ligh∣ter
and more rarify'd Parts and freezing them, as may be in part observed in
the freezing Salt Water; but that neither is this the way that Nature has at∣tempted,
this Experiment will satisfy us, that taking two clear pieces of Ice,
and suffering one of them to thaw and the other to remain frozen, the Ice will
still swim upon the Water, whence 'tis evident that the Water is the same as
to Weight. Besides we find that the whole Bulk is expanded, and not the
frozen part made lighter and the unfrozen heavier; for we find it to break the
containing Vessel if it be such as will not freely give it room to expand; so
that we must here set up a rest, till we may come to the Knowledge of it
some other way.</P>
<P>By these ways are we to proceed to collect all the most common and obvious
Experiments and Observations, that seem to have any thing of Information in
them as to the Nature inquir'd after, or are very significant to any other Na∣ture,
yea though we cannot presently foresee what use there may be of it, yet
as in collecting Timber for a building, hewing off all the Superfluities and trim∣ming
it to be fit for the Repository; we should lay it up in the place of things
of uncertain Use.</P>
<P>But to proceed, the ways of discovering the Properties and Powers requisite
to be well understood and made use of in the compiling of a Philosophical Hi∣story,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three ways of discovering the Nature of Bo∣dies.</NOTE>

</LIST></P>
<P>These are as 'twere the first Elements or Letters of Information, and there∣fore
ought first to be learn'd and understood, before we proceed further into the
deeper parts of Inquiry. But we are not here to stay; for this, like the Knowledge
of Letters, without knowing how to spell with them, or use them, is little worth;
for our Senses are of such a Constitution, that they are very apt to mislead us
in those things where their Power reaches, and in many things they leave us
without being able farther to assist us.</P>
<P>The Defects therefore being naturally two,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Article 2d. By the Senses hel∣ped and assist∣ed.</NOTE> we ought to provide against
them with two Artificial Helps; first, for the more certain determining and
defining the Sensations, and reducing them to a Standard, and next for the
Discovery of those sensible Properties in Bodies, which our Senses are not able
to reach, and defining them also.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st. Reducing Sensation to a Standard.</NOTE> For the exact determining and defining of the Quality or Degree of the
Proprieties, Powers, and Affections of Bodies, we ought to provide such In∣struments
or Standards, as may be capable of receiving all Degrees whereof
that Propriety is capable, after which Search is made: That so by making the
Standard receive the same Degree of the Propriety with that in the Body to be
measur'd, the Division of the Standard may give the determinate Quantity or
Degree, whether the Inquiry be after the Quantity of its Extension, Time, Mo∣tion,
Action, or Passion.</P>
<P>Secondly, For distinguishing the Quality of some of them in answer to what kind,
of this or that general Propriety they belong to; there ought to be peculiar Contri∣vances
that so every thing may bemore exactly defin'd, and nothing may be left to
the unaccurate and casual Information of the Senses, but that every thing that
is taken into Philosophical History, may be capable of being accurately determin'd
by Instruments. Now though it be very difficult to determine exactly in all; there
being some of them, such as the Smells and Tastes of Bodies, which never have
been brought to any kind of Theory, and of which therefore we have so very
Imperfect Notions that we have not words for many, and even those Names we
have are very ambiguous and determine little, yet 'tis not impossible but that
even these also may be reduc'd to a Theory and Standard; for the Variety of
Colours is not less than the Varieties of Tastes and Smells; and yet 'tis not
difficult to derive them all from two Heads, and the Degrees of them; name∣ly,
from the Degrees of Yellow, and the Degrees of Blew, and from the In∣terposure
of White or much Reflection, and Dark or little Reflection: For all
the Colours in the World are made up of the Mixtures of some of these De∣grees,
with the Intermixtures of White and Black, which make them only ap∣pear
more faint or foul. And it seems not improbable also, but that with Di∣ligence
there might be found out such a Theory of Tastes and Smells, as that
from the Mixture of some few with their Gradations, might be explain'd all
the Tastes and Smells in the World. The well determining of which Inquiry,
seems to be likely to afford us as great Assistance towards the Discovery of the
Nature and Constitutions of Bodies, as to their Medicinal Use, as any way
imaginable. Now though this nice distinguishing and defining the Degrees of
some things be very necessary, yet in other things it is often times needless and
<PB N="37" REF="71"/>
insignificant, for in such things wherein Nature does not observe such Nicety
in making use of this or that peculiar Degree or Mixture, but seems indifferent
to all; in such things the distinguishing that Propriety in any one particular
on which Experiment or Observation is made, will rather be prejudicial than
assistant in discovering the Nature in general, but in other things where Nature
seems to be bounded, and to act by a certain Method, and to keep within such
Limits, in those the Limits and Bounds are to be observed, as in observing the
Colour of any Terrestrial Animal: 'Tis not very material to define exactly
what Colour it is of, because we find Nature uses a Latitude; only this may be
noted, that though the Colours of Terrestrial Animals of the same Species are
often very various, intermixt with White and Black, and no one Colour per∣fectly
clear or bright is to be found amongst them, yet in the Colours of Birds
there are indeed to be found all Varieties of Mixtures, but generally the Colour
is somewhat more fixt to the Species, and the most of them more clear and
orient: Which last does discover somewhat of Distinction between the Parts
and Substance of Hair and those of Feathers, namely, that the Parts of Feathers
are far more clear and small, than those of Hair, and consequently 'tis not im∣probable,
but that the constituent Parts may be more porous, defecated and fine.
So likewise the Bounds of Heat, between which Nature has confin'd it self for
proportioning the Animal and Vegetable Life, and beyond either of which Life
cannot subsist, are to be as exactly observ'd as can be defin'd, but the peculiar
Warmth of this or that Animal is not so nice: So likewise for Gravity the
lightest and heaviest Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral Substance, and so for the
rest.</P>
<P>In other things where the exact Degree is very necessary and Fundamental to
the Constitution of the Body, in that case the greater Diligence and Skill is
used in the determining of it the better. Thus in determining the Specifick
Weight, Density, Colour, Malleableness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Gold, or any of the other
Metals: The more exact the Experiments are, the greater Information we re∣ceive
from them of the Nature of those Bodies.</P>
<P>For the making of these Standards and Measures, to determine the various
Degrees of several Proprieties, there may be divers Contrivances for each pe∣culiar
Property, and some of them more fit, convenient, and exact than others.
The Degrees of Light may be determin'd by Comparison to the Light of a Can∣dle,
of a determinate Bigness, plac'd in a long dark Room or Gallery, and by
examining the thining Body at several Distances from that Light; as suppose
the Light or Shining of a Gloworm be to be determin'd in such a dark. Vault,
I try at several Distances from the Candle whereabout the Light begins to be
visible; in departing from the Candle, and whereabout it begins to disappear
in approaching towards it, and that Place I mark for the Degree of the Light
of Gloworms; by the like Method I try the Light of rotten Wood, decaying
Fish, Diamonds, heated Metals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The ways of determining Colours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Observation 9th. and 10th.</NOTE> many skilful Painters and Dyers know
very well without Instruments, but by one not so skill'd, they may be defin'd
by a way I have mention'd in my Micography, which I therefore now omit
to repeat.</P>
<P>The Acuteness and Loudness of Sounds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Time of lasting, Velocity of Pro∣pagation, grea∣test Distance of Extension.</NOTE> and Sonorousness of Bodies, may be
easily enough measur'd by a sound Pipe of a determinate Bigness, and by the
Strength of the Blast that is given by poised Bellows to blow it, other more
loud Sounds may be determin'd also by shooting small Guns with various
Charges, or by the Distance they can be heard, and the like.</P>
<P>Smells and Tastes being not yet reduc'd cannot be so exactly measur'd and
defin'd, but they may be somewhat determin'd, by comparing them to the
Smells and Tastes of Bodies that are most common.</P>
<P>Heat and Cold may be many ways discover'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Distance and Velocity of Propagation, the Cold Air from Snowy Clouds.</NOTE> by Weather-Glasses and Ther∣mometers
of several kinds; the way of making and determining which, I have
shewn in my Micrography, or else by Burning-Glasses, together with the help
of the Thermometers: For if a Burning-Glass of a known Number of Inches
in Diameter be able to melt Gold, and Iron, and Copper, and Stones, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in such
a determinate Quantity of Time; and that the Reflection from a part of it be
able to raise the Standard to such a Degree, it follows, that thereby all De∣grees
<PB N="38" REF="72"/>
of Heat may be easily determin'd; as suppose, for instance, it be desired
to determine the Degree of the Heat of the Flame of a Lamp, intended by a
strong Blast, we find that such a blown Flame is capable of heating Glass Red
hot, and melting it in such a space of time.</P>
<P>To reduce it therefore to the Standard, 'tis easy to see what Aperture of the
Burning Glass will produce the same Effect in the same time, and what Aper∣ture
at the same time (for this is very necessary to be known) will raise the
Thermometer to such a Degree. The Degrees of Cold also may be easily deter∣min'd
by the Thermometer, as I have elsewhere shewn.</P>
<P>The Degrees of Dryness and Moisture in the Air, and sometimes also in
other Bodies, may be distinguished by the Hygroscope, of which I have ex∣plain'd
the way of making and using in my Micrography. Stiffness and Pliable∣ness,
Toughness and Brittleness, are sufficiently obvious, by comparing them
to the Pliableness or Stiffness of pieces of unhardned Iron of peculiar Bignesses
and Shapes, and to the Toughness of Wire of a determinate Bigness: Now
though in all these things we cannot come to a Mathematical Exactness, yet it
will be sufficient if we come as near to the Truth as the Matter is capable of;
fox we find that Nature it self does not so exactly determine its Operations, but
allows a Latitude almost to all its Workings, though as I said before, it seems
to be restrain'd within certain Limits, and beyond those is neither excessive on
the one hand or defective on the other.</P>
<P>The Specifick Gravity of Bodies may be determin'd by weighing in Water.</P>
<P>There are as many various ways also of determining all the other Proprieties,
and reducing them to a Certainty or Standard, but these may suffice for an In∣stance,
to shew what I mean by the determining the Degrees of the Proprieties
in several Objects.</P>
<P>As for the determining of the Figure, Number, Motion, Velocity, Power,
Time, and the like, the ways are sufficiently easy, and the ingenious Inquirer
will upon the occasion, find various Contrivances to determine them.</P>
<P>The second way of assisting the Senses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2dly, By help∣ing the Senses to discover what unassisted they could not, &amp;c.</NOTE> is either first by enlarging their Power,
or Sphere of Activity, and extending it much farther than that assign'd them
by Nature; or else secondly, by reducing other things to such a Constitution,
as to bring them within the Power of the Sense. For the Performance of each
of which there are various means to be used.</P>
<P>And first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st. By enlarge∣ing their Power.</NOTE> for the enlarging the Power of the Sense, and making it capable of
sensating many things, which without those Helps would not have been dis∣cerned
or fallen within the reach of those Senses; of these there may be many
for the assisting of every Sense, but some of them have been more cultivated
than others, and brought to a much greater Perfection, but yet not to the high∣est
pitch they seem capable of, but they are every day more and more improv'd,
and it may be hoped, that this Age may produce the perfecting of some of them.</P>
<P>Of this kind are Microscopes and Telescopes for the Sight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">As for the Sight Micro∣scopes and Te∣lescopes.</NOTE> the one for dis∣covering
the Figure and Magnitude of the small Parts of such Bodies as are
within our reach, the other for detecting the Figures and Magnitude of such
Bodies as are by the Greatness of their Distance, reduc'd to so small a visible
Appearance as that the naked Eye is unable to distinguish either their determi∣nate
Bigness or their Figure, these may be Helps both of Invention and defining:
And as they are indeed the greatest Instance that can be given of the Improve∣ment
of the Power of the Senses; So the perfecting of them is the most likely
way to afford us the greatest help for the Detection of the Nature of Bodies.
For the Eye is the most Spiritual and most capacious Sense we are endowed
with, it affords us the most sudden, most distinct and instructive Information of
all; with this we expatiate through the Universe, and pass from the one end to the
other in the twinkling of an Eye, by this we compare the Magnitude and Mea∣sure,
the Distances, Motions, and the Velocities of all those vast Bodies which
are disseminated up and down through it, and none of the other Senses tend so
much to perfect the Imagination as this. Now whereas the Power of the Sight
in Discovery was not able to distinguish of Objects that appear'd to the Eye
under a less Angle than about a Minute, by the help of these it is able to di∣stinguish
such as would not appear bigger than a third. So that according to
<PB N="39" REF="73"/>
this Calculation, the Power of the Eye is increased near 4000 times as much
more as it was before, and we are capable of discovering things 4000 times
further off, and 4000 times nearer the Eye than we were without them. And
it seems not improbable to me but that each of them may be improv'd so far
as to inlarge that Power 4000 times 4000 times the first Dimension, especially
in such Objects where the imperfect Transparency of the Medium, or the De∣fect
of Light does not hinder this Effect as in things very near the Eye, or in
Objects very near the Zenith.</P>
<P>The Sense of Hearing does not altogether so much instruct as to the Nature
of things as the Eye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hearing.</NOTE> though there are many Helps that this Sense would
afford by a greater Improvement, there may be a Possibility that by Otocousti∣cons
many Sounds very far distant (I had almost said as far off as some Pla∣nets)
may be made sensible, at least the Noises of Thunder might be disco∣ver'd
at a much greater Distance than it can be by the Ear without these
Helps, and hereby perhaps the Variations and Changes of the Weather might
be predicted much longer before-hand than now they are, and Ships at Sea might
perhaps discover an Enemy of Weather coming by the Hearing, as well as they
can now discern an Enemy's Ship by the Sight. As for the hearing of Noises
made as far off as the Planets, I cannot, I confess, my self so far throw off
Prejudice, as not to look on it as a very extravagant Conjecture, but yet me∣thinks
I should have had the same Thoughts of a Conjecture to find out a Help
for the Eye to see the smaller Parts and Rocks of the Moon, and to discover
their Height and Shadow, before I had seen or known the excellent Contri∣vance
of Telescopes. And though methinks from what Experience I have had
of Sounds, I am apt to imagine them not capable of being propagated to so
great a Distance; yet when I consider again, that by very ordinary and casual
Tryals as it were, I have been able to hear Persons discourse distinctly where
others in the same place have not heard any Noise or Whisper, I would fain
perswade my self against concluding or building on the Impossibility of such
things as I am not able demonstrably to prove not possible.</P>
<P>There may be also a Possibility of discovering the Internal Motions and A∣ctions
of Bodies by the sound they make,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Internal Motions of Bo∣dies may be discover'd by Sound.</NOTE> who knows but that as in a Watch
we may hear the beating of the Balance, and the running of the Wheels, and
the striking of the Hammers, and the grating of the Teeth, and Multitudes of
other Noises; who knows, I say, but that it may be possible to discover the
Motions of the Internal Parts of Bodies, whether Animal, Vegetable, or Mine∣ral,
by the sound they make, that one may discover the Works perform'd in
the severals Offices and Shops of a Man's Body, and thereby discover what In∣strument
or Engine is out of order, what Works are going on at several Times,
and lies still at others, and the like; that in Plants and Vegetables one might
discover by the Noise the Pumps for raising the Juice, the Valves for stopping it,
and the rushing of it out of one Passage into another, and the like. I could
proceed further, but methinks I can hardly forbear to blush, when I consider
how the most part of Men will look upon this: But yet again, I have this In∣couragement,
not to think all these things utterly impossible, though never so
much derided by the Generality of Men, and never so seemingly mad, foolish
and phantastick, that as the thinking them impossible cannot much improve my
Knowledge, so the believing them possible may perhaps be an occasion of ta∣king
notice of such things as another would pass by without regard as useless.
And somewhat more of Incouragement I have also from Experience, that I have
been able to hear very plainly the beating of a Man's Heart, and 'tis common
to hear the Motion of Wind to and fro in the Guts, and other small Vessels,
the stopping of the Lungs is easily discover'd by the Wheesing, the Stopping of
the Head, by the humming and whistling Noises, the fliping to and fro of
the Joynts in many cases, by crackling, and the like; as to the working, or
Motion of the Parts one amongst another, methinks I could receive Incourage∣ment
from hearing the hissing noise made by a corrosive Menstruum in its Ope∣ration,
the Noise of Fire in dissolving, of Water in boyling, of the Parts of a
Bell after that its Motion is grown quite invisible as to the Eye, for to me
these Motions and the other seem only to differ <HI>secundum magis &amp; minus,</HI> and
so to their becoming sensible they require either that their Motions be increased,
<PB N="40" REF="74"/>
or that the Organ be made more nice and powerful to sensate and distinguish
them [to try the Contrivance about an Artificial Timpanum] as they are, for
the doing of both which I think it not impossible but that in many cases there
may be Helps found, some of which I may as Opportunity is offer'd make Try∣al
of, which if successful and useful, I shall not conceal.</P>
<P>As for the Sense of Smelling,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Smelling.</NOTE> though it has been less cultivated than that of
Hearing, and seems to be of much less Extent, and to have much less Influence
upon our Knowledge than either of those I have already mentioned, it being
only for the distinguishing of the Effluvia and Fumes of Bodies, which are dis∣solv'd
by and fly upon and down the Air; yet if we consider the Nature of it
aright, we shall find that it is capable of a much greater Degree. We find
that a Hound by this Sense is able for a good while after to discover where his
Game has past, which possibly may arise from the Steams or Efflux of its Body,
which perspiring through the Pores of the Skin, and coming into the Air are
easily precipitated down upon the Track which the Creature has past over, and
so lie loose upon the upper Surface of if, and thereby they easily touch the
Nose of the Hound, which in following his Game he usually either rubs over
the Grass, or Ground, or at least lays it so very near, that with drawing in the
Breath at his Nose, by strongly sniffing; the Volatile Salt, which is in the Ef∣fluvia
of all Animals is easily rais'd and drawn in with the Air, and that Sense
being very acute in this Creature, it easily perceives the smallest Impression
on it.</P>
<P>There may be multitudes of ways of assisting this Sense, some of which I
have already hinted in the Preface of my Micrography, as I have also concerning
some Assistances that may be thought of for the helping of the Senses, of Tast∣ing
and Feeling, which may serve as a Specimen or Example to shew what my
meaning is in this Particular.</P>
<P>The Second way therefore of assisting the Senses in Discovery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2dly, By ma∣king the sensi∣ble Qualities in the Object more powerful.</NOTE> is by making
the sensible Qualities of the Object more powerful than naturally they are of
themselves for affecting the Sense, or more proportionate to the Power and Fa∣culties
of them. This may be various ways performed according to the parti∣cular
Nature of the Objects that are disproportion'd to the Sensory. For</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1"/>First, Some are quite obscur'd and buried in the matter, so as not at all to
affect the Sense, these therefore will need to be excited and made active and
vigorous by Art; thus the Tastes of Metals and divers other Bodies are disco∣ver'd,
by opening and loosing the Bodies of them with appropriate Menstru∣ums;
thus the Light of a Diamond is made visible by rubbing, The Inky Black
Colours of Galls, or the Juice of Oak is made visible by mixing Coperas, The
Sound of a Bell is discover'd by striking it, the Smell of Sal-Armoniack is freed
by mixing Quick Lime, the biting Smell of Mustard-Seed is freed by bruising
and grinding. The internal Heat of Corrosive Menstruums is made sensible by
mixing dissoluble Bodies with them, the Gravity of the Air is manifested by
being weighed in an evacuated Vessel, the Greeness of Gold is discover'd by be∣ing
beaten very thin, the Greeness and Blueness of Copper by Dissolution, the
Salt of Vegetables by calcining, and Multitudes of the like.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"/>Secondly, Some are very languid and weak, and so affect the Sense to which
they are appropriated so very little that they are hardly discernible, such as
these therefore will need to be assisted by Art, and to be made more vigorous
and powerful. Thus the Heat in the Air or Sun Beams, in the coldest time of
Winter, is hardly sensible to the touch; but if the Rays be united by a Burning-Glass,
they will not only be able to warm, but also to burn the Finger; thus
when the Air has very few Effluvia in it of an odorous Body, so that we can
hardly smell them, if drawing in the Breath through the Nostril we make a
great Quantity of that Air pass through it, those few that are collected and
united out of the Air by this means become sensible. Thus the Smells of many
other Bodies are so languid and faint, that they are hardly discernable without
being either heated or rubb'd, the Flexibility of Glass is manifested by drawing
it out into very small Threads. Thirdly, many things become insensible from
their Slowness, these ought either to be accelerated or to be sought after by
<PB N="41" REF="75"/>
other means which I shall shew in the third way of acquiring Information of
the Effects of Nature. If they are such things as are within our Power to pro∣mote,
their Motions are to be accelerated and promoted either really or in Ap∣pearance;
thus supposing the Experiment were true that some Authors have de∣livered
to us concerning the Acceleration of Sallets, we might possibly be able to
see the Motion of Vegetation, as we might also, if that Story be true which <HI>Clusius</HI>
tells us, of the strangely growing and rising Tree; thus the Motion of the Hand
of a Watch may be seen by making it go faster: As to the making them ap∣pear
so though they really are not accelerated, this is done by the Telescope
for the Caelestial Bodies, for by the help of long ones of that kind, the Mo∣tion
of the Sun and Stars is almost as plain as that of a Bowl, the like is done
also by viewing the Shadow of the Sun when cast on the Ground, or a Wall, by
a Body at a great Distance from the shadowing Body.</P>
<P>Thus also the Sound of a String very slackly strain'd is not to be heard, but
by being strain'd harder it yields a very brisk Sound. Iron heated to one De∣gree
of Heat has not acquired Motion enough to make it shine, but if farther
wrought on and agitated by Heat, it shines very bright and clear.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Some Objects are too strong, and so the Sense is not able to indure<MILESTONE N="3"/>
the examining of them: In this case, the vigorous Influence of them on the Sen∣sory
is to be abated; thus the Body of the Sun is so bright as to be able to de∣stroy
the Sight, but if it be veil'd with a Fog or Cloud, or the Sight be veil'd by
a deep colour'd Glass, or a small Aperture, or the Reflection of it be view'd in a
Bucket of Water, the Eye may without much Trouble behold and view it. Thus
the burning and corrosive Liquor of Oyl of Vitriol, or the like, which would
burn the Mouth and spoil the Sensory, when allay'd by the Mixture of much
fair Water, becomes a very pleasant Taste, and suited well enough to the Or∣gan.
Thus the Sound of Bells in a Steeple is so loud, that the Ear is hardly
able to distinguish the differing Tones, but if the Ear be placed at a convenient
Distance it does plainly perceive the Harmony, and easily distinguish each se∣veral
Note and Tone.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Other Objects there are, which, are so minutely dispers'd through<MILESTONE N="4"/>
other Bodies, that unless there may be many of them collected together, or
that that Matter through which they are disper'd be separated from them they
are not capable of affecting the Sense. Thus Salts may lie invisible in Water,
till by Evaporation the Water be separated, and Coral dissolv'd into Vinegar
becomes invisible, till collected by Praecipitation into a visible Powder, thus
Vapours dispers'd through the Air become small, and to the naked Eye invi∣sible,
till they are united closer together in a Cloud or Mist, the invisible Stars
which are dispersed through the Aether, become not visible without being many
of them united into a Galaxie, or cloudy Star, thus the Tinctures also of s∣everal
Liquors are hardly visible till much of the more Watery and Transparent
Parts are evaporated.</P>
<P>Fifthly, There are other Objects of the Sense, which though in themselves<MILESTONE N="5"/>
very active and powerful, yet by being mixt and united with Objects more
powerful, their Action on the Sense becomes imperceptible, because overpow∣er'd
by the stronger Influence of the associated Objects: Thus the Light of the
fixed Stars in the Day-time becomes invisible by reason of the greater Light of
the Sun which fills the Air. Now the way of making these Objects sensible, is
by removing the Influence of the more powerful Object, either by destroying,
weakning, abating, or if it be capable of it, by strengthning the Powers of the
weaker. Thus (if we may believe what is affirmed by many Authors) the
Stars may be made visible in the Day by placing the Eye at the bottom of a very
deep Well, they may be also made visible by a total Eclipse of the Sun in the
Day-time, and the like. Thus the Melody of a sweet Voice is not heard among
a noise of Trumpets or Drums; thus the Pallate cannot distinguish the Sweet∣ness
and Variety of such Tastes as are mingled with others more strong and
powerful; therefore even the best Drinks relish ill after eating sweet things,
thus 'tis commonly said, that the smelling of Hounds is spoil'd by suffer∣ing
<PB N="42" REF="76"/>
them to smell of strong scented Bodies, thus the Light of a Gloworm, or Diamond, or
the sparkling of a Cat's Back by rubbing is not to be seen but in
the dark, and the Gravity of the Air seems Lightness when encompassed with
Water, which is much heavier and more powerful, but if the Water and all
other incompassing heavy Fluids be remov'd, the Gravitation of it becomes ve∣ry
manifest.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="6"/>Sixthly, There are other sensible Qualities, which cannot be distinguish'd for
want of Opposites and contrary Qualities. Thus in a Full Moon the Irregu∣larities
of the Surface are not discover'd, for want of dark Shadows to be in∣termixt
with the brighter Reflections; thus the Taste of Bodies is better per∣ceiv'd
by being tasted after other Substances of a different Taste, the Bright∣ness
of any Colour is better discern'd by being interpos'd between Colours of a∣nother
kind. And 'tis a Maxim in Musick, that Harmonies become more plea∣sant
and grateful, that is, affect the Sensory better by having Discords inter∣mingled:
Thus Cold is better felt after Heat, Roughness after Softness, Dry∣ness
after Moisture, Sweetness is better tasted after Sowerness, and the like in
all the Senses. As for the Medicinal assisting of the Senses, I leave that to the
Physicians.</P>
<P>There remains a third way of inquiring into the Nature of Bodies and Opera∣tions,
by which we may be able to write a more accurate History of them, for
all these Ways I have already mention'd, though in themselves very requisite,
and as it were the Letters or Elements to what follows; yet if the Natural Hi∣storian
proceeds no further in his Examination, his Information will be very im∣perfect,
and he that shall afterwards come to make use of it will find himself
necessitated almost to begin the whole Inquiry anew, to make over again all
those Experiments and Observations that he finds Registred, and to intermingle
divers others to the end that he may find out that which ought to have been
ready prepared to his hands; and in Truth, without prosecuting this third way
'tis not possible to make Experiments with any Judgment, that is, to know
which Experiment is more or less significant, or of greater or less Concernment
as to the Discovery of the Proprieties sought, for most Experiments are like
single Letters which seldom signify but when they are joyn'd and compounded
in Syllables or Words; nor can the History be freed from infinite Repetitions
and Interpositions of Experiments and Observations, which are either very insig∣nificant
or at best indicate nothing else but what is much better manifested in
some of the other Entries and Remarks, and so serve only to fill Room need∣lesly
and perplex and weary the User or Student of it: For 'tis not fit that every
Experiment that is made should be registred, but of a Number of good Observa∣tions
and Experiments, such ought to be chosen and pick'd which are as it were
the Epitomy of the rest, and comprise in short and plainly all that is more
largely and widely diffus'd and obscur'd in others.</P>
<P>That therefore which will regulate and rectify both the former ways of pro-ceeding
is this Third,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 3d. or the Third Way of discovering Na∣ture by Indu∣ction.</NOTE> which is an Inquiry into the Nature of things by the
Effects produced at a greater Distance, and more remote from immediately af∣fecting
the Sense, and this is by putting of several Observations and Informations
together, and collecting from them, and by reasoning and deducing from them,
so as to proceed, to the culling and chusing of the Experiments and Observa∣tions
already made, and to the inventing of such farther Experiments and Ways
of searching, as shall be most significant to the Inquiry; for this will not only
make the History much shorter, and more compendious, but much plainer,
significant, and full.</P>
<P>The third way therefore of discovering Nature, is by the Observation of a
great Number of Effects and Circumstances; and these, tho' very many, may
be very well reduced under these two Heads.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> By observing the <HI>Effects</HI> themselves produced.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> By observing the <HI>manner of Proceeding,</HI> or means made use of.</P>
<P>Again, The <HI>Effects</HI> themselves may be <HI>Intermediate</HI> or <HI>Ultimate.</HI></P>
<P>1, 2, The <HI>Intermediate</HI> may be either, <HI>constant, necessary, and always inter∣pos'd</HI>
or <HI>accidental,</HI> and sometimes present sometimes absent.
<PB N="43" REF="77"/>
3, 4. The <HI>Ultimate</HI> also may be either <HI>necessary</HI> or <HI>accidental.</HI></P>
<P>In the second place, The <HI>Manner</HI> also of Natures proceeding may be either
more <HI>obvious</HI> or more <HI>secret,</HI> and both these may be observed either in several
Bodies, or else in several Operations.</P>
<P>The more <HI>secret</HI> are such wherein the manner of proceeding is more obscure
and difficult to be found, and not yet discoverable by the Senses, or any other
known way.</P>
<P>These more occult and secret Workings of Nature are diligently to be noted
and examined.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of the more secret workings of Nature.</NOTE></P>
<P>1. First, The Operations of Bodies are to be more especially noted which seem
to produce Effects, by means of which we have not the least Information im∣mediately
from our Senses, such as we call Sympathetical and Antipatheti∣cal,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>2. Next, Operations of Bodies at a much greater Distance, such as we use
to call Influences or Influxes.</P>
<P>3. Lastly, we must observe the yet more spiritual and more subtile Operations
of Phantsy and Imagination, Memory and Ratiocination: Both of sleeping and
waking living Creatures, how they work on their own Bodies, and whether they
work on others?</P>
<P>The more obvious are such wherein the Agents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of the more obvi∣ous workings of Nature.</NOTE> Patients, and Means are
more plainly to be discerned by the Senses, or other commonly known ways,
which may be such as these following.</P>
<P>1<HI>st.</HI> In general, how Nature proceeds in generating, increasing, weakning, and
destroying the same Proprieties in several States of the same Body.</P>
<P>2<HI>ly,</HI> How Nature proceeds in distributing the same Proprieties in several Bo∣dies,
in what Bodies it has placed a dawning or beginning of it, in what a
middle Constitution, in what the highest Perfection, in what a decaying, in
what it has quite extirpated it?</P>
<P>3<HI>ly,</HI> How Nature proceeds in Conjunctions or Combinations; that is with
what other kinds of Proprieties, the same Quality is joyned in divers Bodies?
With which it flourishes most, with which it withers, with which most usual,
with which most seldom?</P>
<P>4<HI>ly,</HI> How Nature proceeds in Separations or Disjunctions, that is, what Pro∣priety
it seldom or never joyns in the same Subject?</P>
<P>5<HI>ly,</HI> To observe the Transitions of Nature, how from the Destruction of one
Propriety it generates this, that, or another, whether that be the same in all
Bodies, or how it varies? as sweet into sowre, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>6<HI>ly,</HI> To observe the several ways Nature takes in several Bodies to produce
the same Effect.</P>
<P>7<HI>ly,</HI> To observe how, where, and when Nature makes use of the same Bo∣dy

<P>8<HI>ly,</HI> To distinguish as near as may be, when there seem to be more than one
Cause conducive to the producing of an Effect; which of them is most power∣ful,
which less, which least, and this by varying one and th' other of them, and
observing the Issue. And by observing the Effects of each, when mixt with other
Bodies in other ways.</P>
<P>9<HI>ly,</HI> To observe the Resemblance and Discrepancy of Natures producing the
like Parts in differing Kinds, Species, or Individuals?</P>

Creatures, how it passes from one to another, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>11<HI>ly,</HI> To observe where and how Nature seems sometimes to be frustrated;
and how and where it fails or misses in producing its usual Effects.</P>
<P>12<HI>ly,</HI> To observe the Deviations of Nature in framing Specifick Bodies, and
the several Circumstances that attend upon such Deviations.</P>
<P>13<HI>ly,</HI> To observe the Deviations of Nature in producing Individuals such as
Monsters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="78"/>
14<HI>ly,</HI> To observe the concomitant Proprieties of Individuals in their greatest
and lowest pitch of Perfection they seem capable of.</P>
<P>15<HI>ly,</HI> To observe the various workings of Nature in various Places, and Times,
how such Circumstances alter her Course, as Birds in the Air, and on Land,
Fish in fresh and salt Water, Men in <HI>Guiney</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>16<HI>ly,</HI> To observe what things seem most conducive to the Perfection or Im∣perfection
of Productions.</P>
<P>17<HI>ly,</HI> In particular we are to observe, especially and more attentively, the
workings of Nature where she seems to be peculiar in her manner, and seems
not any where else to follow the like Method.</P>
<P>18<HI>ly,</HI> To observe and enquire after what middle way, or somewhat resem∣bling
Method can be found, which is as 'twere interposited between this pecu∣liar
and the more common Method.</P>
<P>19<HI>ly,</HI> To observe how much, and by what Degrees Nature is made to alter
its Course by Art.</P>
<P>20<HI>ly,</HI> To observe where and by what means Art causes Nature to deviate
where it assists, promotes, perfects, impedes, diverts, destroys the usual Course
of Nature.</P>
<P>21<HI>ly,</HI> To observe the Natural and Artificial ways of producing the same
Effect, as distilling salt Water, hatching Eggs by Artificial Heat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

each other.</P>
<P>25<HI>ly,</HI> To enquire and try how many Mechanical Ways there may be of work∣ing
on, or altering the Proprieties of several Bodies; such as hammering, poun∣ding,
grinding, rowling, steeping, soaking, dissolving, heating, burning, free∣zing,
melting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>26<HI>ly,</HI> To enquire and try how many Mechanical Ways there may be of sepa∣rating
Bodies; as winnowing, sifting, washing, filtering, straining, wringing,
pressing, distilling, evaporating, precipitating, Chrystallizing, burning, copel∣ling,
freezing, shaking, knocking, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>27<HI>ly,</HI> To inquire and try how many Mechanical ways there may be of uni∣ting
and incorporating Bodies into one another; as by melting, Dissolution,
jumbling; charring, digesting, Insolation, by mixing a third, by taking away
a part, by Compression, by opening, by Time, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>28<HI>ly,</HI> To inquire and attempt by what means Bodies may be changed or
transmuted, from one thing to another by a real change of all their former
Proprieties and sensible Qualities, and by having acquired new ones, being al∣tered
in their Consistence, Colour, Bulk, Gravity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as the Mixture of Tin and
Copper, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>29<HI>ly,</HI> To observe, or rather contrive, by what Means or Supplements Na∣ture
may be more sensibly explained, that so the Nature of insensible Opera∣tions
may be more easily guessed at and imagined.</P>
<P>In the making of all which Observations, Tryals, and Inquiries, great Care
and Judgment must be used in exactly determining the Quantity, Quality,
Time, Place, Space, and several other Circumstances of the Ingredients, Effects,
Processes, Doubts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that all things may be reduced to some Certainty of
Number, Weight, and Measure, and that nothing may be left to doubting,
Hesitation, or Ghesses, that no part of these Materials which are for the Foun∣dation
may be defective or faulty, which may endanger the whole Super∣structure.</P>
<P>There are many other ways of makinguse of and deducing from Experiments
and Histories, for the raising of more general Axiomes, and for the building of
a Body of Philosophy, than these I have mentioned, which I must refer to some
other Opportunity; these seeming to me sufficient to inable a diligent Inquirer
to set his hands to promote significantly this great Work of compiling such a
Philosophical History, as shall be both sufficient and adapted for the perfecting
the Knowledge of the Works of Nature. And these being once well under∣stood
<PB N="45" REF="79"/>
and practised, all the other will easily follow: That therefore these may
be the more plain and easy to be understood, I shall endeavour farther to ex∣plicate
each of them, and to exemplify them with some easy and obvious In∣stances.</P>
<P>The first way therefore of discovering the Power and working of Nature
more mediately, is by the constant and more necessary Effect, which are pro∣duc'd
by the working Power, before it produces its final and ultimate Effects,
and these serve as a Torch, Drum, or Light, by which we may be guided in our
pursuit of Nature, and be inabled to distinguish by what Steps, and which way
Nature proceeds.</P>
<P>1. For instance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Instances in the Effects themselves.</NOTE> Suppose it be inquir'd to know whether the Sun be a fired
or burning Body, Here the Body to be examin'd is so far off, that we cannot
make any Tryals or Examinations of it, and 'tis of that Bigness that it cannot
be expected to be consum'd in many Ages, and so the ultimate Effect is not
to be look'd after; the Helps therefore of knowing may be some such as these,
what are the intermediate Effects of all Fire? Heating, shining, emitting some
kinds of Fumes and Vapours, wasting the Body it burns, and usually at last
consuming it: These therefore are the things to be look'd after, and diligently
examin'd; as first whether the warming of the Earth by the Sun Beams be not
in the same manner perform'd as a Body; suppose an Apple is warm'd by the
Fire, whether the Cause of Subterraneous Fires and Earthquakes may not pro∣ceed
from the Heat of the Sun, as Blisters and Eruptions on the side of an Ap∣ple
that is roasted by the Fire. Next, Whether the Colour of its Light be not
like that of Flame, especially that of Nitre and Sulphur. Thirdly, Whether
it yield any Smoke or Fumes, and especially whether such <HI>maculae</HI> and <HI>faculae</HI> as
have been discover'd in it, can be observ'd when at the Brink to be elevated
above the Surface of the Sun: These must be made with great Diligence and
very accurate Glasses, as must also this last, which could it be certainly known
would afford us the greatest Probability, and that is the discovering of the Bo∣dy
of the Sun to diminish and grow less, which perhaps to After Ages may not
be impossible, if with very accurate Telescopes this Age do exactly determine
the Diameter of the Sun. Thus the Scorbute, and many other Diseases, are a long
while discoverable by certain Symptoms almost insensible and scarce regarded,
before it comes to rage with its more direful Effects: By which means a diligent
Observer may detect the very Inclinations of Nature, and then surely much more
easily turn them. Thus the Observations of the Change of the <HI>Nuclei</HI> of Co∣mets
is an Argument of the wasting and Consumption; thus also, by the daily
Progresses of the Motion of the Comet, we may easily judge of the Distance
and Velocity and way of it.</P>
<P>2. Secondly, Nature may sometimes be discover'd by comparing accidental
intermediate Effects; these as they are for the most part not thought of, and
are a Product of Providence, so do they generally afford very singular and ex∣cellent
Information, and usually much more than the more constant and ne∣cessary
and expected Circumstances. Thus by an abortive Birth, much more
may be learnt of the manner of Formation in the Womb, than by only examin∣ing
a perfect Infant: Thus the passing of the Comet very near some Star, so
that the brightest part of the Tail seems to cover some Stars, and yet very little
eclipse their Light, is a help to judge that the Substance or Consistence of it is very
much rarify'd, and somewhat of the Nature of Smoke; Thus also by the Cur∣vity
of the Tail of the Comet, and by the Deflection of it many times a good
way out of the straight Line, which passes through the Body of the Comet,
we may find that it cannot be caused by Refraction, as many suppose, but is
rather a real Body.</P>
<P>3. Thirdly, Nature may be discovered by the constant ultimate End, or last
Effect of a Principle. Thus somewhat of the Nature of a Comet may be dis∣cover'd
by the end of it, and this we find always to be by degrees growing
smaller and smaller, and fainter and fainter, till it disappears; and as it daily
decreases in Bulk, so does it also in Motion, whence 'tis not improbable that
<PB N="46" REF="80"/>
the Cause of both is from the Increase of Distance, and the Obliquity of the
Line of its Motion to the Eye. Whereas, if it should accidentally happen,
that the Comet should dwindle away and vanish, or be suddenly extinct when
in its greatest Velocity and Brightness, 'twould be an Argument that its Consti∣tution
were of another Nature than what we shall hereafter indeavour to shew
it probably to be, which may serve as an Instance to explain what we mean
by our</P>
<P>Fourth Method of tracing Nature by the accidental ultimate Effects. An In∣stance
of this 4th way may be this; suppose the thing sought for be the Cause
of Earthquakes, Here if we inquire after the End or Events of them, we shall
find that they have sometimes ended in strange and monstrous Eruptions of
Fires, and Smokes, and Waters, and the like, casting forth great Quantities
of burnt and melted Sulphur, Sands, Stones, Earths and Minerals, together
with new Rivers and Streams of boyling Waters, sometimes raising, otherwhile
sinking Mountains, sometimes raising, sometimes sinking Islands, sometimes
digging, sometimes filling Caves. Hence 'tis not improbable, but that Subter∣raneous
Fires are the chief Cause of those direful Effects, and that those Fires
may be fed by Supplies of Nitrous and Sulphureous Substances, with which
those Places usually most abound, that are or have been subject to these Acci∣dents;
for 'tis not else imaginable without the Supply of Niter, how those
Fires should continue to burn, since I have not yet found any Substance what∣soever
that would burn without a Supply either of fresh Air or Niter (the Rea∣son
of which I hope I have given in my Micrography) and 'tis very hard to
imagine how such vast Fires should be supply'd with a sufficient Quantity of
fresh Air, unless there be many Ventiducts under Ground, whereas we have no
Knowledge of any: Or unless by the Influx of Springs and Rivers, the Vapours
of the Water may serve to supply the Defect of Air, which whether so or not
some further Inquiries and Experiments ought to be made; and though they
should not be found to be sufficient for this Effect, yet they seem very much to
contribute to the Violence of the Commotion and Eruption, which the break∣ing
of Aeolipiles, and small Dubbles of Glass seal'd up Hermetically half fill'd
with Water, seem further also to illustrate.</P>
<P>5. A Fifth way of discovering Nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2dly, Instances in the manner and means of Natures Ope∣rations, first the more secret.</NOTE> is by taking more especial Notice of
such Operations and Effects of Nature as seem to be more secret and reserv'd,
working on Bodies remov'd at some distance, such strange Effects as our Senses
are wholly unable to shew us any probable Cause thereof; for by discovering
the true Reason of such Effects, we give our selves a new or Sixth Sense,
which will open us a large new Prospect into Nature that we dreamt not of
before. An Instance of this may be the Verticity or Direction of the Load-stone
towards North and South; the Gravity and Attraction of the Earth towards
its Center, the Influence of the Moon on the Waters of the Sea, or on Vegetable
or Animal Bodies, the Attraction of Jet, Amber, Red wax, and the like:
we should very much labour to find out all the Assistances we are able for the
perfecting of such Discoveries, by collecting all such Experiments together, and
by comparing them one with another, that so the Mind may by some of those
ways hereafter to be mentioned, discover first the Similitudes and Diversities
of such Operations, and may the better be enabled to know what further Ob∣servations
and Experiments are necessary for the Discovery of their Nature.
Such Operations and Experiments therefore are to be sought after for from their
Discovery, the Causes of much greater Effects may appear. The Verticity of the
Loadstone may perhaps explain to us, why the Axis of the Earth keeps a Pa∣rallelism
whilst it moves about the Sun; and the Explication of Gravity may
shew us the true Cause of the Circular Motion of the Moon about the Earth,
the Satellites about <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Saturn,</HI> and the Primary Planets about the
Sun, and may also shew us the reason of the Currents, Ebbings and Flowings
of the Tide, and the like, which I may hereafter more fully explain.</P>
<P>6. A Sixth way of discovering Nature, is by taking particular notice of such
secret Proprieties of Bodies as cause them to unite or net unite with other Bodies,
<PB N="47" REF="81"/>
or as cause them to operate, or not to operate on contiguous Bodies, these are
Proprieties of Bodies of which the Sense can give us no other Information, but
of the Effects; and therefore the Discovery of the Causes of these will give us
another, or a 7th Sense, whereby to watch and follow Nature. Of this kind
is the Animation (as I may call it) of Iron by the touch of the Loadstone, the
Dissolution of hard Bodies by appropriate Menstruums, the Congruity or Incon∣gruity
of Fluids with Fluids, or of Fluids with consistent Bodies [that is, a
Propriety whereby Fluid Bodies will readily unite and intimately mingle them∣selves,
or adhere to some kind of Bodies, and will by no means unite and min∣gle
with or adhere to other] the raising Fermentation by Addition of Leaven
or Yeast, the firing a Heap of Powder by a spark of Fire, the destroying many
Thousands by the Infection of one Man, the Impregnation of a whole Cluster
of Eggs by one treading of the Cock; Experiments therefore and Observations
of this kind should be carefully sought after, and all the Circumstances and
Accidents diligently mark'd, measur'd and defin'd, for that these Proprieties
whatever they be, seem to be some of the most considerable Instruments which
Nature makes use of in all, or at least in some of the most considerable of its
Productions. I have, I hope, made it probable at least, that Fire is nothing
but the Dissolution or Corrosion of Sulphureous heated Bodies, by the Air as a
Menstruum, and had I here a proper place, I hope I could shew that Fermen∣tation
is somewhat Analogus, or of the same kind with Dissolutions or Corrosion:
If therefore we can by deducting from Observations and Tryals, find the true Na∣ture
of this Propriety, what a Multitude of things will there be explicable thereby,
for though at first-sight all these kinds of Experiments seem little instructive,
because their Operations for the most part are such as fall not under our Senses,
yet when their Nature is detected, that we know how to unlock those Myste∣ries,
then we shall find their great Usefulness.</P>
<P>7. Further, Another way of discovering Nature, is by taking more especial
notice of such of her Works, wherein she seems to act yet more secretly and
farther remov'd from the Detection of our Senses, such as in the Formation and
Configuration of Bodies: And here we are to observe all such things as vary
and change those usual Methods, for if herein her Workings also can be de∣tected
to be Mechanical, it will not then seem impossible but that some of the
most considerable Effects of Nature may be detected by Mens Industry, and to
this end all kind of Impressions on the Phantcy are to be observ'd what kind of
Alteration they make in the Body, as in the Formation of the Faetus, in causing
Miscarriages and Abortions, in curing or producing Diseases; for these kind of
Actions, we term more spiritual, because our Senses help us not at all
in discovering of them, and they stand up as an Opprobrium to Philosophical
Inquiry, as being generally believ'd impossible to be detected, and much less reduc'd
to such a Degree of Science as might tend to practise, yet if we more seriously
consider the Progress of Nature from the more simple and plain Operations to
the more complicated and abstruse, we may from them deduce a great Argument
of Incouragement. For we shall find it to make but very small Steps, and to
add but a little more in one thing than in another, to make it a degree higher
in Perfection; there is but a small difference between Earth and strong Concre∣tions,
between such Concretions and Salt, between the crystallizing and shooting
of Salt, and the Vegetation of Mould, and less between the Vegetation of
Mould and Mushrooms, and but a very little between the Vegetation of Mush∣rooms
and Moss, and as little between Moss and Grass, and between Grass and
the most bulky Vegetable, and no great matter between the Vegetation of
Plants and Zoophyts, and there is no great Difference between Maritime Zoo∣phyts
and Oysters, Blubbers and the like; between those and Periwinkles, and
other kinds of Shell-fish, between Shell-fish and crustaceous Creatures, between
those and Fishes, between Fishes and amphibious Creatures, such as Morses and
Sea-Calves, and the like, between those and Aerial Animals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All such
Operations and Experiments therefore as tend to the Illustration of one of these,
are more diligently to be remark'd.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="82"/>
1. To proceed to the more obvious workings of Nature;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The more obvi∣ous workings of Nature ex∣plained.</NOTE> <HI>the first way of
discovering them, is by observing the Method or Progress of Nature in genera∣ting,
increasing, weakning or destroying the same Propriety in divers States of
the same Bodies,</HI> for hereby may be discover'd what things and Circumstances
are adjuvant, and what destructive of this Propriety: As suppose Greenness be
the Propriety sought for, we may observe that that Propriety is most, and in
its greatest Perfection when the Plant is so, and that before the Plant is come
to Maturity and is too moist, waterish, and tender, it inclines or is ting'd too
much with Blew, and afterward, as it decreases in Moisture and grows more
dry, the Yellowness increases; and as it more and more dries and grows old,
so the Yellow is more and more heightned, till at last it ends almost in a Red.
So that Blew seems more appropriate to Liquidity and Moisture, and Yellow
to Dryness and Sulphurousness; unless by comparing it with other Effects of
the same kind in other Bodies, as in the Generation of Colours on melted Me∣tals,
where Yellow beginning first, then Red, and after Purple, according as
the vitrify'd Skin grows thicker and thicker, we may suppose that the Blewness
proceeds from the Thickness of those Parts which afford the Colour by their
plentiful Supply of Moisture, and that as that Moisture decreases and dries
away, and those Colour-making Bodies grow thinner and closer together, so
the Colour grows by degrees Yellower and Yellower, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Again, Suppose Liquidity be the thing to be observ'd, we shall find that Wa∣ter
for Instance, when cold beyond such a degree grows very consistent, solid,
and hard, when it only suffers a gentle degree of Heat or Warmth, it becomes
liquid and moist; but if Heated beyond that degree, it becomes Aerial, Fluid
and Rarify'd. Suppose Light be the Propriety to be trac'd, we may find that
Fish when fresh or newly dead shine not or afford no Light, when they begin
a little to taint and ferment as 'twere, they begin to shine and glare, but as
they grow more putrid and rot, so again the Light decreases and at last goes
quite out. So that it seems for the producing Light in such a Body there is
requisite a determinate Degree of Fermentation or Corruption: Suppose the
ebbing and flowing of the Sea be inquir'd after, we find that the new Moon
makes the ebbings and flowings very great; as the Moon goes further and fur∣ther
towards the first Quarters, so those Motions do more and more decay, and
are lowest or weakest at the Quarters again, as the Moon goes further from
that and nearer to its Opposition to the Sun, so the Tides again increase, and after
Decrease to the last Quarter, and after it again increase to the New
Moon: For this it remains yet farther to be observ'd whether <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI>
the Tides are greater at the Full or the New Moon, or whether less at the first
or last Quarter; for from the determining of these, there would be many helps
afforded for the discovering of the true cause and reason of them. Suppose
Specifick Gravity be inquir'd after, we are to inquire what Body there is which
in several States of it hath several Degrees of it: And for this we may find Air,
which according as it is more or less rarify'd, so has it more or less Gravita∣tion,
whence we may deduce the Rarefaction and Condensation of Bodies does
diminish or augment their Gravity, and 'tis not improbable as we shall add by
and by, but that this Propriety is general, that the comparative Gravity and
Levity of Bodies depends upon their comparative Condensation and Rare∣faction.</P>
<P>2. <HI>The Second way of discovering Nature may be, by observing how Nature
proceeds in distributing the same Propriety in several Bodies.</HI> As suppose Gra∣vity
be the Propriety inquired after, we may find among Fluid Bodies, that in
Flame 'tis very little or nothing at all, in Air but very faint, in condensed Air
somewhat more, in Oyl of Turpentine 'tis yet more prevalent, in ordinary re∣ctify'd
Spirit of Wine a little more, in Water greater, in several Saline and
Chymical Liquors, yet more prevalent, as Oyl of Vitriol, Oyl of Tartar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
in Quick-silver most of all, by which Progress we may learn that Gravity has
little to do with Fluidity; for that almost the heaviest Body in the World is
fluid as is also the lightest, and there are few intermediate Degrees of which
there may not be found some fluid Substance. And this will be farther mani∣fested
also, if we consider the Dispersion of it among consistent Bodies, for
<PB N="49" REF="83"/>
there are consistent Bodies almost of all Degrees of Gravities. But on the other
side, we shall find that Gravity has a great Dependence upon Rarefaction and
Condensation, for always the most rarify'd Bodies seem to be the most light,
and the most condens'd the most heavy, for as in Flame it seems to be least so
in Gold does it seem to be most prevalent.</P>
<P>3<HI>ly,</HI> Another way of discovering Nature, is by such Observations and Expe∣riments
as do manifest the Method of Nature in Combinations or Conjunctions,
that is, how and with what other; the Propriety sought for is combin'd in seve∣ral
Bodies. As suppose the Propriety of Heat be inquir'd for, we shall find
that in the Sun and in Fire it is joyn'd with Light, but in Corrosion of Metals
by Saline Liquors and in Fermentation, and in rubbing Motions, without it;
whence we may conclude Light or Darkness not necessary to Heat: Next Heat
being produc'd by Oyl of Vitriol and Oyl of Turpentine mixt, and by two solid
Bodies rubb'd together, shews that neither is Fluidity or Consistence essentail
in the Production of Heat; from the Heat in Flame, and boyling Water, we
may conclude Dryness and Moisture likewise not to be essential; from the be∣ing
able to make both Gold and Air hot, both Gravity and Levity, and Den∣sity
and Rarity, appear not to be essential, but from a constant Conjunction of an
internal Motion of the Parts, where there is Heat; may be concluded, that those two
have some Dependance one upon the other. From the almost constant Combi∣nation
of violent Heat and Light, we may conclude them to have some great
Affinity, as also because in most Bodies Fluidity is joyn'd with some degree of
Heat; we may conclude those also to have much Affinity, but how much, and
in what manner must be determin'd by some of the other ways of Inquiry.</P>
<P>4<HI>ly,</HI> Another way of discovering Nature, is by tracing her ways in disjoin∣ing
or separating Proprieties, that is, very seldom or never joining them toge∣ther
in the same Body; as Fluidity and Sonorousness, Shining and absolute
Cold, Malleability and Transparency, Sweetness to Smell and Taste, Hardness
and Toughness, Levity and Density. These and their Contraries are chiefly to
be observ'd, because such as these do still lead us nearer and nearer to the Mark
we aim at, and do as 'twere circumscribe Nature, and bound it so as that we
know it cannot go beyond such or such Limits.</P>
<P>5<HI>ly,</HI> Another way of tracing Nature, is by observing the Transitions it makes
from one Propriety to another; of this kind of Observations and Experiments
great Multitudes should be collected, that so the Affinity and Dependance of
one Propriety upon another may be the better understood: For by this means
the Circumstances also being well observed, the Nature of any one of those Pro∣prieties
being known, the other cognate Propriety will easily be discover'd. As
Sourness and Acidity does usually follow Sweetness in most kinds of fermen∣ting
Liquors, as in Wine, Beer, Ale, Metheglin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And in the making <HI>Sac∣carum
Saturni,</HI> Sweetness seems to return again from Sourness. Sweetness
by Combustion or Heat very often degenerates into Bitterness: And Bitterness
by long keeping seems to turn into Sweetness, as in Hopt Beer long kept, Bit∣terness,
Acerbity, and Sowrness in unripe Fruits, by Maturity turns into Sweet∣ness;
the Bluish Greeness of Buds of Plants by degrees turns perfectly Green,
and as they decay degenerates into Yellow, as I noted before; Plumbs, Grapes,
Mulberries, and the like, being of a palish Green at first, by degrees turn Red,
and at last Blue; the Colours on tempering Iron or Steel are first of a Straw Co∣lour,
then Yellow, then Red, then Purple, then Blue, and so onwards. To
this Head may be referred many of those excellent Experiments of the Trans∣mutation
of Colours, publisht by the Incomparable Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> Cabages by an
Inclination to Putrefaction do often produce a most fragrant and Musk-like
Odour, but suffer'd to putrify quite, their Stink is not to be indur'd; Apples
also by Putrefaction do oft produce very pleasing Smells, Musk also is said to be
the Corruption of the Flesh and Blood of a kind of Dear: But generally all kind
of putrify'd Substances, especially Animal, ingender very loath some Smells, which
seem to be caus'd by a very penetrant and volatile Salt, which by the Disso∣lution
of the Texture of those Substances is let loose, and being very Aerial
<PB N="50" REF="84"/>
readily mixes and joins it self with the Air, from whence at first it seems to
have been taken.</P>
<P>6<HI>ly,</HI> Another way of discovering Nature, is by endeavouring to find by what
ways Nature produces the same Effect in divers Bodies, whether always the
same ways, or for the most part by differing, or by some few; and among all
these Experiments and Observations, we are to make choice of such especially,
wherein the Propriety sought for is produced by some Cause that seems least
incumbred with perplexing Circumstances.</P>
<P>As for instance, Whether Nature produces Heat in the Sun, in Fire, in Mo∣tion,
in Fermentation, in Baths and hot Springs, in quick Lime slack'd with
Water, in the Operation of corrosive Menstruums, in Animals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all the same
way, or whether differing ways: That is, whether the Sun be not a Sulphu∣reous
and Nitrous Earth or Globule fir'd and consum'd, or dissolv'd either by
it own Nitrousness, or by the Circum-ambient Air, whether that and our com∣mon
Fire be not much the same kind of Operation (but with differing Men∣struums
and differing Dissolubles) with that of corrosive Menstruums; and
whether Fermentation be not a kind of Dissolution or Corrosion, whereby the
Parts work upon one another, and whether quick Lime slack'd by Water will
not prove the same kind of Operation, Namely, the working of the Alkali in
the quick Lime on the Body of the Water; whether Baths and hot Springs proceed
not from Subterraneous Fires, and those maintain'd by a nitrous
and sulphureous Fuel there plac'd; whether the Heat in Animals be not caus'd
by the continual working of the Liquors and Juices of the Body one upon ano∣ther,
and more especially by the uniting of the Volatile Salt of the Air with
the Blood in the Lungs, which is done by a kind of Corrosion or Fermentation,
which to me I confess seems somewhat more than probable; First, Because that
only those Animals that breath much are very hot, all other kinds of them are
even cold to a Man's touch, as Fishes, Snakes, Frogs, Cameleons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Next,
That all those Exercises which cause the Blood to circulate much, and conse∣quently
to make the Animal breath much, do make the Heat to increase, and
the expir'd Vapours, to be more copious. Thirdly, That such as stir little, and
consequently whose Blood does circulate but slowly, breath but little and
seldom, and are generally most cold in Constitution and grow Flegmatick, and
at last short breath'd, and are very apt to fall into Fevers or Excesses of Heat
and Inflamations as it were; because those Parts which should have been wrought
on by the Air, and thereby have been brought to another kind of Constitution
and concocted, are in great Quantity laid up in the Blood▪ So that at last the
Blood becomes over charg'd by them, and the Lungs become stuff'd and stopt,
Whence wanting the Preservative Salt of the Air, they upon all occasions are
apt to cause unnatural Fermentations and Putrefactions which inflame and de∣stroy
the natural Texture and Constitution of the Blood, Humours and Parts,
and so vitiate oftentimes and destroy the very Principles of Life. Further, the
Ebullition of Steams into the Lungs, which are carried out with the Breath by
Expiration, may probably be caused by the Ebullition of the Blood upon the
mixing of the Salt of the Air, somewhat after the Nature, as Oyl of Tartar
will bubble by the Affusion of Volatile and Acid Salts, now whether so or not,
deserves to be further inquir'd into. But this by the by; Another Instance, to illu∣strate
this Head, may be the Method Nature uses in generating Colours: That is,
whether the Colours in the Rain▪ bow, in Triangular Crystal and Gems, in Bub∣bles
and plated Bodies, in Flowers, Woods, Leaves, Stones, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In Liquors
and Flame be all of the same kind, and from one and the same Principle dis∣guised
under several Masks or Vests; or whether Nature has not almost in eve∣ry
of them taken a differing way. This will be found by reducing each of them
to the most simple Principles, and by endeavouring to find out whether
there be not some one Principle wherein they all agree; for if it can be found
that all of them do depend upon Transparency and Refraction, and that by de∣stroying
that Principle in any of them all the Colours will immediately va∣nish,
'tis a very great Argument that that is the chief Cause of all those Ap∣pearances,
and all the rest are but accidental and circumstantial, somewhat of
this kind I have endeavour'd to explain in my Micrography. A Third thing
<PB N="51" REF="85"/>
may be the Method of Nature, in producing Light, in some we find it to be
effected by a violent Dissolution of the Body, as in Fire, and perhaps in the
Sun, in others we find it to be an Effect of a very gentle and scarce sensible
Dissolution, as in Fish and rotten Wood, and perhaps the Gloworm; in others
the Effect of a gentle Heat or Motion, as in a Diamond and <HI>Bononian</HI> Stone, from
another Cause in the Scintillation of the Hair of a Cats Back when strok'd
much and quick in the dark, from another Cause in the shining of the Juice of
a 100 legg'd Worm when kill'd in the dark. From another, the shining of
<HI>Ignes Fatui,</HI> Dews, Sea-water, and the like. Now from the comparing of
these several ways Nature makes use of for the producing of these Effects,
it will not be difficult to find that there is one Principal Cause of all, which is
in almost each of them conceal'd under a differing covering. Now by casting
away all those Circumstances, which by comparing them one with another,
will be found needless and accidental as to the producing of Colour, we may
quickly come to that which is the only true and adequate Cause.</P>
<P>7<HI>ly,</HI> Another Method of Discovery may be by taking notice of all such Pro∣cesses
of Nature, wherein by the same effective Principle it causes quite differ∣ring
Products: For by distinguishing and defining carefully the considerable Cir∣cumstances
of such Operations, the Nature of both of them will be the more
easily found. As why Heat for instance, does in Bricks first by a gentle de∣gree
cause a Condensation, and shrinking, and hardning, and afterwards by a
more violent causes a Rarefaction, Liquefaction and softning, if we observe
well the Circumstances we may find that the first is caus'd only by the flying
away of the more watery and liquid Part that kept the other a little further
disjoin'd, whereby those more solid Parts slide and fall nearer together, where∣as
even then those more solid Parts were not condens'd but rarify'd, as all other
solid Bodies are by a sensible degree of Heat; and as for the other Effects they
are but a further Augmentation of the same Product. Another Instance may be
the Condensation and Rarefaction of Water by Cold; the Reasons of one of
which Operations seem a little more abstruse, and deserve to be farther in∣quir'd
into; Namely, why Water should continue to condense more and more,
till it comes to such a degree of Cold, and afterwards according as the Cold
increases, so does the Expansion of the Water into Ice. The Discovery of the true
Reason of which Experiment will very probably afford us a much larger Pro∣spect
into the ways of Nature than we have yet been Masters of, towards the
finding of which it will be requisite to take notice of and examine well all the
Proprieties of Ice and Snow, such as are the seeming Blebs or Bubbles generated,
the Figures of falling Snow and the Figures of frozen Snow, both which are
very strange and extreamly pretty; the Figures and manner of the freezing of
Ice, the Refraction of Ice, and the Lightness of it, and the like.</P>
<P>8<HI>ly,</HI> Another way of Discovery, is by indeavouring to find out such Experi∣ments
as may distinguish between two or more Principles, and shew what the
Influence or Power of each of them is towards the producing of that Effect
whereunto they seem both or all to concur: Of this kind there are Multitudes
in Natural Operations, which Operations are very seldom so single as to be
perform'd and perfected by one active Principle only, but to the producing of
almost all its Effects, Nature for the most part makes use of two, three, or
more co-operating Principles; the distinguishing the adequate Power of each of
which is one of the most difficult things in all Philosophical Inquiries, such
Methods and Rules therefore as assist us in this Performance, ought especially
to be look'd after. As for Instance, in the Fulmination of Gunpowder, what
the several Offices of the three Bodies of which it seems necessary to be com∣pounded
are, what Part the Nitre, what the Sulphur, and what the Cole acts▪
the like in the fulminating Powder, describ'd by <HI>Glauber,</HI> made of Salt of Tar∣tar,
Sulphur and Nitre, whose Operation seems to be quite differing from that
of Gunpowder, and nearer to approach to the Nature of <HI>Aurum Fulminans,</HI>
which is a third thing of this kind to be observ'd, made of the Powder of
Gold precipitated out of <HI>Aqua Regis,</HI> by Spirit of Urine, or Salt of Tar∣tar;
and seeming to want the Sulphur, which seems necessary to the other two,
<PB N="52" REF="86"/>
unless the Gold may be said to supply it; the like Inquiry may be made concer∣ning
the Cause of Dissolution: As for Instance, of Gold in <HI>Aqua Regis,</HI>
whether the Gold it self do not contribute as an active Principle; to the disper∣sing
of it self in the <HI>Aqua Regis,</HI> as well as the <HI>Aqua Regis</HI> doth to the Penetration
or corroding the Gold; and in the <HI>Aqua Regis,</HI> what the Sal Armoniack,
and what the Nitrous Spirit contributes towards that Action. And herein the
ways for Discovery must be by varying either the several Ingredients themselves
if it can be, and by observing in what the new substituted ones differ from the
other either in Quantity, Quality, Time, manner of operating, and the like,
or else by indeavouring to vary and alter the Quantities of the Ingredients them∣selves;
and by observing diligently all the Circumstances of the succeeding
Effects. Or else Thirdly, something may be learnt by mixing one or two other
Ingredients, and observing and comparing their Effects to consider in all of
them in what common Nature they all agree, and in what they most of them
differ, what Bodies seem to promote, and what to hinder those Operations.</P>
<P>9. Another way of tracing Nature is by observing the Resemblance or Dis∣crepancy
of Natures working in the producing the like parts in differing Kinds,
Species, or Individuals. This Method is very luciferous, and produces very co∣pious
Matter of Information, for by observing how Nature varies its Method
according to several Designs we may easily by comparing, and rejecting, quickly
arrive to some positive Information, what the Use and Business of each part is;
as for instance, by observing the Keys of Sicamores, Maples, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and finding in
them a tender, but perfect Plant wrap'd up and clos'd in a Box or Case, so as
to preserve it from taking Injury, which by being buried in the Ground in warm
Weather does by degrees swell and break the Shell, and grow up in a Plant:
And comparing this with the like Process of most other Seeds, though the Plant
or Web of them be not so visible, we may conclude that they also have the
same Principle in them though somewhat farther remov'd or hid from our Sense;
And by comparing these with the Eggs of Serpents, Crocodiles, Aestridges,
Tortoises, and Multitudes of other Oviparous Insects, who lay their Eggs in
convenient Receptacles, that the Heat of the Sun or Air may hatch, we shall
find it very probable that Nature takes the same course both in the one and the
other; but with some difference, that in some she seems to operate more open∣ly,
in others more secretly and reserved. And by comparing likewise the Me∣thod
of Nature in the Formation of the Faetus in the Womb, we may find rea∣son
to conclude, that all kinds of Vegetable and Animal Bodies are propagated
by much the same Ways and Methods, though somewhat varied in Circum∣stances,
the Observation and diligent Examination of which by Experiments
will hugely promote this Inquiry. Thus also by comparing the Contrivances
for Motion in the Leaves and Branches of the sensible Plant, with the Muscles
and Instruments of Motion in Insects, Birds, Beasts, Fishes, scaled, shell'd, and
crustaceous, each of them seeming in some particular or other to differ, and by
joyning to these several other self-moving Bodies, as the Beard of a wild Oat,
the wreathed Seeds of Muskgrass, the shrinking of Gut-strings, the Expansion
of fired Gunpowder, the Corrosion of acid Liquors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we shall find many
helps to judge of what is most likely to be the true cause of the Motive Power
of the Muscles: For every Discrepancy in these brings us a step nearer to the
thing sought for, by lesning the Bounds, or at least by fixing the Terms with∣in
which it must be found.</P>
<P>10. Another way of Discovery is by taking notice of the Transitions of Nature,
by what degrees and steps it passes from one thing to another in the Formation
of Species; for this will afford, very great Light, how to find out which Pro∣duct
of Nature is most simple, and which most complicated, which the most
perfect, and which is farthest from it, and wherein the Additions or Defects lie.
And accordingly from this we shall be the better inabled to find out the Signi∣ficancy
and Use of each part: As suppose from a Man Nature seems to descend
to an Ape, Monkey, or Baboon, which we may find in very many things to
imitate Man very exactly, as in its Figure, Gate, and Jesture, as is testified by
—in his Natural History of the <HI>East Indies,</HI> in frowning, grinning, and
<PB N="53" REF="87"/>
laughing, as divers Travellers assure us, but seem to want the Use of Reason
and Speech, the things wherein they differ in Figure from Men are chiefly
these; that the comparative Bulk of their Brain is much less in Proportion to
their Bodies than that of a Man, as has been excellently well observ'd by the
Learned Physician Dr. <HI>Willis,</HI> that they are all over cover'd with Hair, that
their Heads and Noses are flatted, and their Mouth thrust out, tending somewhat
towards the Shape of other Beasts; that their Legs and Arms are much
shorter in proportion to their Bodies than those of Men, and that their Spine,
and consequently the Spinal Marrow is yet spun out longer and smaller into a
long Tail: And which may be further taken notice of, that those which have
naturally the longest Tails are usually <HI>caeteris paribus</HI> the furthest remote from
imitating the Actions of a Man, and do seem nearest approaching to the Capa∣city
of other Brutes. And there is no doubt but that a diligent Observer may
by accurately anatomizing each, and comparing them together, find divers other
considerable Variations which are of a kind of middle Constitution, between
those of a Man and those of other the most brute Creatures; which may much
inable an Inquirer in finding what parts of a Man seem most to contribute to
the Perfection of his Natural Parts. Another Instance may be this, to observe
the Transition of Nature between the Figure of precious Stones, and the crystal∣lizing
of Salts, between the shooting of Salt, and the growing of Mould and
Mushrooms, and its Transition from Mushrooms to Moss, and from Moss to
Grass, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The accurate Observations of all which Transitions, together with
all the Circumstances that attend upon them, will with a Clew almost lead us
from the Explication of the most plain, single, and obvious Phaenomenon, to the
Understanding of the inmost and most secluded Process of Nature.</P>
<P>11. Another way of Discovery, is <HI>by taking Notice of all such Experiments
and Accidents as shew the Frustrations and Failings of Nature;</HI> for all such Ex∣periments
as these, the Circumstances being diligently noted, afford very essen∣tial
Distinctions, and do very much direct, circumscribe, and limit the Mind
in its search: and, by shewing what things are destructive to it and
over-rule and govern it, and what pervert it and turn it out of its Course, it very much fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
the Mind for positive and affirmative Knowledge of the Causes of those Effects.
For instance, Let the Nature of Fire be the thing sought for: Here, we are to
look chiefly after such Experiments as shew the failing of Nature in this Ope∣ration,
such as these; the falling of Water on the Fire makes it immediately
go out, query whether from the Coldness or Moisture; that 'tis not from
the Coldness is evident, because boyling Water will produce the same Effect, nor
is it from the Moisture, because then Spirit of Wine would do the same thing
which, yet it does not; query further therefore, whether it be by keeping off
the Menstruum of the Air, if so, then the keeping of that Body any ways from
coming to it will do the same Effect. To confirm this, we have many Instances
of the Frustration of Nature; as that a Candle will presently go out if inclos'd
in a Vessel, whereby the fresh Air is excluded: The like it will presently do,
if it be included in a larger Vessel, and the Air drawn out. Coles likewise
will do the same, if included in a close Vessel, nay though by a pair of Bel∣lows
included in the Box with them, they be all the time blown upon by them,
as I have several times shewn before very many illustrious Spectators.</P>
<P>12. Another way of Discovery, is <HI>by observing the Deviation of Nature in
framing Specifick Bodies,</HI> such kind of Operations wherein Nature seems to
step a little aside out of its usual Rode, and seems to take up a new Method
in forming: Now these though in themselves they seem at first to amaze and
perplex the Mind, yet when by diligent Examination and Inquiry the Vail that
Covers them is remov'd, and it be discover'd to which of the more common
Operations of Nature it belongs, and wherein it differs from them, then does it
as the former, highly assist the Judgment in determining the true Nature of
that Principle, by manifesting what great Influence these or those accidental
Concurrents had in altering or disguising it so as to make it appear somewhat
extraordinary and miraculous. As for instance, the Loadstone seems to be an
Instance of the Deviation of Nature out of its usual Method, and seems to con∣tain
<PB N="54" REF="88"/>
some Principles in it altogether extraordinary and very wonderful, but
when we have taken this excellent Composition to pieces, and found that it is
resembled in some of its Proprieties by the Motion of an Unison String, in others
by the Attraction of rubbed Jet, Amber, Wax, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that both its Axis may be
varied Mechanically into another Posture, and that its Poles may be turn'd end
for end, and that its Vertue may be quite destroyed as well as Mechanically
augmented; that it has a Dependence on the Earth, and is mov'd by it, as ha∣ving
the first and chief Magnetical Principle which moves all the rest; that the
Sun, Moon, and all other the Planets, have the same or alike Vertue with this
of the Earth, and that the Loadstone has given the occasion of the Discovery of
all these: When we consider this Instance, I say, we may plainly see of what
great Use Observations and Experiments of this kind are, for the finding out of
the Methods and Ways of Nature which are somewhat beyond the Discovery of
our Senses. Another Instance may be a Diamond, which for two or three Pro∣prieties
seems extraordinary, the first and chiefest is Radiation in the dark, after
it has been gently rubb'd or struck, which gives us a new manner of producing
Light seeming to depend on the other Property, namely, an extraordinary Hard∣ness,
and affords anew Difference or Help of Rejection: for since in this Experi∣ment
there is neither Combustion nor Flame as in Fire, nor Moisture and Putre∣faction
as in Fish and rotten Wood, nor a Motion of Animal Spirits, which
some pretend to be the Cause in Glow-worms and Cats Eyes; nor any previous
Light, which some have imagined to inhere and remain like a Liquor in the
Object till it be evaporated or dry'd, as in the Bononian Stone, by the help of
this one extravagant Instance all these Suppositions are rejected, as not at all ne∣cessary
to the Existence of Light, and only this one essential Propriety seems to
be set up in the stead of them; namely, a very quick Vibrative Motion, which
a Body of that extream Hardness seems only capable of from so small and sud∣den
a Percussion, as that has been observed to shine with. Another Instance of
this Rule may be the Apparition of Colours in the Triangular or Sexangular
Stiriae of Crystal, for therein Nature seems to generate a lovely Variety of Co∣lours
after quite another way, than it seems to do in other Bodies whether Ve∣getable,
as Flowers, Leaves, Woods, Fruits; or Animal, as Blood, Gall, Hair,
Feathers; or Mineral, as Metals, Marchasites, Scoria, Vitriols, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in all which, some Authors will needs have a various Temperament of Sulphur and
Mercury to be the chief and principal Cause. Now by this one Experiment or
Observation of Crystal, these and divers other phantastical Hypotheses about
Colour are overthrown, and by examining it thoroughly it may be found that
this does demonstrate only one thing necessary, namely, a considerable Refra∣ction
enough to obliquate the Puls of Light, as I have in my Micrography in∣deavoured
more fully to explain. Such Experiments as these do hugely streng∣then
the Discursive Faculty, and (at one Blow as it were) inables it to cut off
all those numerous Heads of Hydra, which when cut off one by one do a▪ fresh
spring up again, and create new and greater Difficulties, but by watching Nature
and taking hold of this opportunity of the Deviation of it, the Victory
becomes easy and speedy.</P>
<P>13. Another way of Discovery, is <HI>by taking notice of all such Productions of
Nature, as are differing from the rest of the same Species,</HI> and are therefore
truly esteem'd monstrous and wonderful by the Generality, but a Philosophical
Historian has somewhat else to do than admire them; for these are indeed the
most instructive and the richest Commodities he can meet with. His Business
therefore is diligently to set upon examining of it both as to the Causes of it;
and as to the particular Effects, and to indeavour to find out wherein lies the
Deviation in what considerable Circumstances they differ from the most usual
Effects, and wherein the Mysterie of Nature's proceeding after such a manner
lies, what Cause it was made it thus deviate. One therefore that is fit to
make Observation of this kind, must first be very well skill'd in the most usual
ways of Nature of that kind, so as that he may be able readily to detect all
the Aberrations of Nature: Nor is this Knowledge indeed sufficient, but he ought
to be somewhat knowing also in the Uses and Designs of the parts of that Spe∣cies
whereof the thing under Examination is an Aberration▪ for 'tis none of the
<PB N="55" REF="89"/>
least Helps, towards the finding out the Nature of the thing sought for, to be
able to know and judge what things are material and considerable enough to be
observed; for 'tis not the setting down of every little Variation, of which there
be Multitudes in every individual of the same Species, whereby they differ one
from another, most of those being to be past over as the Effects of a <HI>lusus na∣turae;</HI>
that is, of many little Circumstances which perhaps 'tis impossible ever
to be able to take notice of, or find out, there being continually such Multi∣tudes
of them and those so complicated: Nor again on the other side are small,
nay almost unperceivable Variations in some cases to be past by where the Cau∣ses
can be certainly found, or where those though never so small Variations,
become considerable toward the producing greater Effects; for sometimes those
Variations which seem greatest and most conspicuous are very inconsiderable,
and as to the promoting of Natural Knowledge scarce significant. So that 'tis
not every one that can be presently fit for this Undertaking, but it requires a
long and sedulous indeavour and accustoming ones self to observe the Methods
and Courses of Nature; without which endeavour'd 'tis much to he fear'd
that the History so written will be full stufft with Impertinencies, and con∣tain
very little of any thing solid, material and useful. Of this kind there
are Multitudes of Instances among Animals, Vegetables, and Minerals, all
kind of extravagant natural Actions, Generations, Vegetations or Accretions,
Diseases, Casualties, Conjugations, and Separations, and the like; being to
be numbred under this, and every one in their several Kinds, if accurately ex∣amin'd,
affording choice and rare Informations which assist us beyond any other
way, how to command and regulate Nature, by either promoting or further∣ing
it in its usual Method.</P>
<P>14. Another way of Discovery is, <HI>by observing the concomitant Proprieties
of Individuals in their greatest or highest, and in the lowest pitch of their Per∣fections
or Existences.</HI> As the former was of the extravagant and preter-natural
Concomitants in a preter-natural State, so this of a Natural: For though the
former be an excellent Method of Discovery, yet that alone, and of it self is
not sufficient; we ought as well to know what things and Circumstances ac∣company
the natural Progresses of Nature as well as the preter natural, that
by the comparing these two together the Differences between them may more
manifestly appear. As for instance, that in an Infant the parts are soft, moist
and tender, and as very unfit for Animal Motion so have they very little, till
after a certain time most of those parts begin to grow a little more dry and
stiff, but yet retaining Plenty of Natural Juice and Moisture, whereby all the
numerous Parts of the Automaton (like those of a new and clean Clock, that
has been a little us'd to take off the Roughness and is well oyl'd) easily and
glibly move and slip by one another and consonant hereunto, that Constitution
of Body is ever in Motion, eats much and acts much, is quickly wound up, and
whurr 'tis quickly down again, and a new supply of Aliment must be had.
And thus it continues to be wound up and run down, till by degrees the Oyl
begins to be a little spent, and to grow somewhat more stiff, and the Parts to
be well worn and adapted one to another when it arrives at its best going; the
Child being become a Man, his Parts by much Exercise become very prompt
and habituated, they move not so much, as at first but more steady and regular,
the parts become more firm and consistent, the <HI>Humidum Radicale</HI> seems to be
perfectly concocted and brought up to its just Consistence, being neither too
thin and watery, or too thick and clammy: But as he grows older the Parts
grow dryer and stiffer, and less fit for Motion; the Natural Moisture is grown
too thick and flug, and the parts begin to shrink and shrivel, and to be clogg'd
and worn, and all the Motions become <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lower and more heavy, and the parts
grow quickly weary, a little Food serves long, the Juice in many parts of the
Body become so charg'd with excrementitious parts thereof, that it turns
into a kind of hard or stony Consistence: and like an old decayed and foul
piece of Clock-work, here a Pivot is worn loose in his Socket, there the Oyl
is thickned with Dust and Filth, as almost to stop the Motion: Here a Wheel
is bent, and there a Tooth is worn out, and the like. Now as these things
which are the common Accidents of Watches, and do generally happen to all
<PB N="56" REF="90"/>
sooner or later, according as they are better or worse used, are very easy to be
found by a diligent Observer, though altogether ignorant of Watches; and
by comparing the several Accidents one with another, he may at last be
able to understand a Watch thoroughly, and know wherein the Goodness or Badness
of one consists, and what is good and bad for it, so may one that is wholly
ignorant of the Fabrick of any Natural Body be able to learn the Nature of
it, by observing the several Accidents that happen to it in the several States and
Conditions of it.</P>
<P>15. Now as the Observation of the various Accidents of Bodies in several
States is one way of Discovery, <HI>so another way may be of observing such Va∣riations
as happen to Bodies from their being produc'd at differing times, or in
differing Places, of the same Medium, or in differing Mediums, or with a
differing Quantity;</HI> for each of these kinds of Observations do further manifest
to us by what Rules Nature works, and by what things it becomes regulated
and circumscrib'd. Of this kind may be the observing of the difference be∣tween
the Shape and Nature of a wild <HI>Irish</HI> Man (or such a one as has nothing
of Education to biass him) and one of <HI>Saldania</HI> or the <HI>Cape of good Hope.</HI> The
Difference between the Stature, Age, Strength, Shape, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Men at the be∣ginning
of the World and now. The Difference between the Fins of the flying
Herring and the Wings of a Bird, between a Crab and a Spider, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the one
being an Insect of the Water, and the other of the Air. The Difference between
Beasts of the same Species under the Pole, and under the Line, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>16. Another way of Discovery is, <HI>by observing what things most conduce to
the Persection or Destruction of any Production:</HI> This is differing from the
next but one preceding, in this, that there we considered only such things as ac∣cidentally
were found Concomitants with the several Conditions not so much
considering them as Causes; but here out of many of those former, we segre∣gate
and collect such as seem very active and contribute either to the better
perfecting, or to the Destruction of Overthrow of such a Body. As suppose
that Fire be the Subject enquired into, we shall find Nitre or fresh Air, and
some Sulphureous Body, to be that which most powerfully makes that Opera∣tions,
and that nothing does destroy and hinder it so much, as the separating
of the intermediate Contract of those two Bodies, by the throwing on of Water
or any other incombustible and sluggish Liquor.</P>
<P>17. Another way of Discovery is, to find out and enumerate <HI>all such Opera∣tions
of Nature as wherein it seems to work after a peculiar manner, and very
differing from her more usual Methods;</HI> for by this means many Circumstances
are cut off, which being generally the Concomitants in her more usual Method,
are therefore more liable to be thought essential to the producing of the Pro∣priety
sought. For Instance, the Flying Herrings commonly observed flying in
great Sholes in the Torrid Zone, may seem as an excellent Instance to manifest
that to the Business of flying, there is no need of Feathers about the Body, nor
in the Wings, nor in the Tail, as most imagine; and the Poets seem to con∣firm
it by the Story <HI>Daedalus</HI> and <HI>Icarus,</HI> since this Fish has nothing but Fins
and Scales: Nor secondly, is there any need of a flat Tail, such as all kind of
Birds have and Bats; for the Tail of this Fish stands edge-ways: Nor thirdly,
is there any need of Joynts in the Arm, or Stems of the Wing, as in the Pin∣nions
of Birds, and in the Fingers of the Bat; nor is it so necessary that the
Stem of the Wing must needs grow in the Center of Gravity, since this is
not observ'd in this Creature, and divers other such Circumstances which were
generally believ'd to be necessary Circumstances to the Business of Flying by
the Peculiarity of Nature, in Shaping this Fish after this kind, and induing it
with the Power of Flying; they are all of them discovered to be only most pro∣per
for that peculiar Creature to which they were adapted, and where no such
Accomplishment is bestowed on a Creature by Nature, 'tis as proper if we
would supply that Defect artificially to make use of one way as well as the
other, and perhaps could there be made an Artificial Repository or Magazine of
Strength, which for Weight and Bulk would not be too cumbersome; 'tis not
<PB N="57" REF="91"/>
impossible to fit a Pair of Wings for a Man to fly with, which may be con∣triv'd
somewhat after the manner of the long Fins of these flying Fish. Sup∣pose
Congruity be the thing look'd after, the thorough considering of the
Nature of the peculiar Species of it between Iron and Magnets, will help to cut
off many Circumstances which divers Instances in other Bodies do seem to make
necessary.</P>
<P>18. Another way of Discovery is, <HI>by inquiring after and diligently observing
what middle way of Nature there can be found between those extravagant and
the more common ones.</HI> For such as these serve as a <HI>Vinculum,</HI> to conjoyn both
these together by some common Nature, which is to be found in the third,
and thereby hugely promote the Explication of both the other. As suppose,
Congruity be the Nature sought, the more common ways of Congruity are be∣tween
divers Homogeneous Fluids and Solids that are immediately contiguous;
the more <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are and singular is between two Load-stones or two Magnetick Irons,
or between a Loadstone and Iron contiguous and at a distance, between these
too may be interposed the Attraction of Amber, Jet, Wax, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which as they
sometimes act at a distance when they are rubb'd, and also on the Bodies con∣tiguous,
very much help to explain the Congruity both in the one and in the
other.</P>
<P>19. Another way of discovering the Methods of Nature's working is, <HI>by ob∣serving
and comparing the Productions of Art with those of Nature.</HI> And for
this purpose it would be very requisite to have a perfect Account of all the Pro∣ductions
of Art, such as are dispers'd up and down in several Trades and Occu∣pations
of Men, whether for Profit or Pleasure; and especially all those ex∣cellent
ways of working on Bodies by Chymical Operations, such as Menstrua,
Mistion, Digestion, Fermentation, Distillation, Calcination, Fusion, Freezing,
and the like; every of which as they admit of a vast Variety, so do each of
them serve as so many Torches to light us in the dark Passages of the Labyrinth
of Nature, where the Assistance of the common Works of Nature, like the Ra∣diation
of the Sun, cannot go along with us. For instance, suppose we com∣pare
an Automaton with an Animal, as I mentioned a little before by the by.
Or suppose we compare Paper or Hats with the Skin of an Animal, because the
Texture of those two seems of much Affinity with this, we shall find the Me∣thod
of Nature prettily explicated by them: For in both those Artificial Pro∣ducts
we find that the Artists endeavour first to cut, grind, or beat into small
parts the Materials they are to use, then to make them soft, light, and supple
with Water or other Liquor, then to dispose, place, or put it into such Forms
or Moulds as may shape it into what Form they design it, then they there so
work and order it, that the Moisture may by degrees waste, and the solid Parts
unite more closely together, adding to it such glutinous Matter as may make it
fit to stick, hold and grow stiff, firm, and strong together; and lastly, by se∣veral
ways they smooth and colour, or beautify the Surface: All which Par∣ticulars
may be understood more fully by my Descriptions of those Trades, and
the Explication of their several Operations, which I must reserve for another
Opportunity. Now Nature in preparing the Matter that does repair the Skin
or Flesh of the Body, seems to proceed much after the same Method, the Food
is chosen, then groun'd or chewed, then digested or brought into the Form of a
Milk or Froth, then dispers'd over the Body, by degrees thicked, and lastly
polished. Now though every Particular does not exactly hit, yet there are
many that seem to have a great Affinity, and serve to prompt the Intellect,
and very much to help the Fancy and Imagination to conceive of those things,
and of the Method of Nature, and they will serve greatly to instruct the
Mind what things are to be look'd after and examin'd in the Proceedings of
Nature: And the more Variety there are of these Artificial Instances, the more
will the Mind be quickned to Inquiry, and the more taken off from Prejudices,
or an Imagination, that because the Process of Nature in one part may agree
with one part of the Artificial Process; therefore that all the other parts of the
one most agree with the other parts of the other, for when we see that even
Art can use the same Beginning, but yet very differing intermediate Proceedings,
<PB N="58" REF="92"/>
and yet at last by both produce the same Effects, we shall find cause to think that
Nature may do so much more. And therefore I might have added to Paper
and Hats, Silks, and Cloths, and Linnen, and divers other such Artificial Con∣textures
which have every of them a differing way of proceeding to perfect the
End.</P>
<P>20. Another way of Discovery is, <HI>by observing where and by what means Art
causes Nature to deviate or alter its usual Course, where it assists, promotes and
perfects, and where it impedes, diverts, or destroys.</HI> Of this there are Multitudes
of Instances in all things, about which Art has been used, and therefore needs
not exemplifying; but certain it is, that this Method affords extraordinary Help
for Discovery of the true Nature of the efficient and material Causes of things: For
knowing what in Art is able to change, and divert the Proceedings of Nature,
and what to stay or promote them, it will not be difficult to find what they are
that are thus wrought upon, since it seems very probable that they must be somewhat
of the Nature of those in Art which promote them, and somewhat of a
contrary Nature to those that do alter and impede them. As because 'tis found
by experienced Gardiners, that Artificial Heats ripen Fruit, 'tis not improbable
but that 'tis a convenient Degree of Natural Heat that contributes most to that
Effect. Now as we should observe diligently the Causes or Ingredients which
do co operate with Nature, so should we also observe in what Quantity it is
most assistant, by what Steps and in what Degrees it assists the Circumstances of
Time, Place, manner of Application, Operation, and the like; for without the De∣termination
of these Particulars, the Informations will be lame and imperfect,
and nothing of Certainty can be built on them, for that which is assistant in one
degree, at one time, in one Place, or at such a Distance, is perhaps destructive
and pernicious in another: This will not only help the Mind to judge of what
the cause is, but the Degrees and Circumstances of Time, Place, Quantity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>21. Another way of discovering Nature is, <HI>by observing and comparing the Na∣tural
and Artificial ways of producing the same Effects.</HI> For having the Artificial
way in our own Power, and being able to alter and change, and vary it: We
have much greater Helps to find out the true Reasons and Causes of those Ope∣rations,
and having found them in Artificials 'twill be very easy to apply them to
Naturals, and this way of inquiring where the Subject is capable of it, is the most
easy of any I have yet mentioned, and the most instructive, and does more im∣mediately
inform the Sense and the Imagination with a true Idea of it, oblite∣rating
and dispelling dark and confus'd Notions. Thus, for instance, had we
not found an Artificial way of hatching Eggs by a gentle and equal Heat from
whatever cause it proceeds, we should have been very apt to have fancied
strange kind of irradiating and plastick Influences from the brooding Hen to the
hatching Eggs, but by the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Experiment of hatching them in Dung and
Ovens, or Stoves, which has been tried other ways very successfully in <HI>Den∣mark</HI>
(as <HI>Bartholine</HI> affirms) and in <HI>England,</HI> and elsewhere, with the gentle
Heat of Digesting, and Lamp Furnaces; and also by the hatching them oftentimes
in Womens Bosoms, and divers other ways, 'tis evident that such Phancies
will easily vanish. Thus many People are still very apt to fancy a certain at∣tractive
Vertue in the Sun, which by a kind of Magnetism does draw up the
fresh Water out of the Sea, leaving the salter part behind, and by that its Pow∣er
does keep it suspended in Clouds: Whereas if we consider that any other
Heat to that Degree will do the same thing, whether the Heat be placed above
or below, or on one side or t'other, we shall then find cause to think that 'tis not
an attractive Vertue of the Sun that performs this Effect, but that 'tis the Heat
of the Sun which working on the superficial and fresher parts of the Water
warms them, and by degrees rarifies them into the Form of Air, which having
much heat and Agitation in them, do so far expand themselves as to make them more
rarify'd in <HI>Specie</HI> than the Circumambient Air, which being therefore heavier
than them causes them to ascend in the same manner as Water makes Air, or
Oyl, or any other Liquor lighter than it self to ascend to the Top. This way
does very much discover the naked Truth and Simplicity of things, by taking
away the Vizour under which it lay disguised. Much in the same manner as
<PB N="59" REF="93"/>
Travellers judge of the Beauty of the <HI>Persian</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Ladies, whom they ne∣ver
saw, by observing and examining such as they have more Liberty to see and
converse with.</P>
<P>22. Another way of discovering Nature is, <HI>by observing the difference be∣tween
the Products of Nature and those of Art.</HI> And without this Head indeed
the former way cannot be compleat, and therefore this has an immediate De∣pendance
upon it: This way does farther assist the Mind to find out and fix
the essential Differences and Proprieties of Natural Actions; for by comparing
these kind of Observations with the former, we shall be able to judge better of
the differing Nature of those Operations, and what Propriety 'tis in the one that
makes the Work more perfect, and what 'tis makes the other miscarry. Thus the
Reason why Rain Water seems to be more pleasant than distill'd, seems to be
partly from the Saline or Nitrous part of the Air which does somewhat purify it,
and partly also from the gentle or moderate Heat of the Sun which acts upon
the Surface of the Water, and partly also from the greater Coldness of the outward
Air, which being therefore heavier does sooner carry up the Vapours, though
but a little rarify'd; the distilled Water on the other side contracts an Empyreume
from the greater Heat, which is apply'd at the bottom, and so the whole
is much heated, and from the Pentness of the Vessel, whereby all those Parts
that rise, though many of them are Saline and Terrestrial, are driven over with
the Vapours, and must necessarily fall and unite again with the Water in the
Recipient; whereas in the Air they serve to another purpose, for the Colle∣ction
of those Parts together at the top of the Clouds, and there kindling, seems
to be the cause of Lightning and Thunder.</P>
<P>23. Another way of Discovery is, <HI>by observing the differing Materials, and
ways of producing one and the same Effect by Art.</HI> For this does mightily
free the Mind from Prejudice, and from being too much imbued with any one
Experiment or Method of proceeding, and each of them does much contribute
to the Explication of the rest. Thus by observing that the spirituous part of
Urine may be extracted out of it, either after it has stood a considerable time
to putrify, or immediately after the Intermixture of quick Lime we may learn,
that Putrefaction is nothing but a kind of Corrosion or a working of some of
the parts of the Urine upon others, and thereby a setting others at Liberty.
Thus the being able to make a very Volatile Spirit, and Salt with Horns, Bloods,
Flesh, Hair, Hoofs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Animals, we may learn that all the parts of Ani∣mals
seem to be much of the same Nature, but only diversify'd and drest un∣der
several Textures and Schematisms; and by observing that Spirit of Soot
yields much the same kind of Spirit, we may thence perhaps with some Proba∣bility
argue, that the cause of these Effects may proceed from a Corrosion or
mixing of the Salt of the Air with the Materials that yield those Substances;
the Operation of the one being made in the Chimney, and of the other in the
Lungs or Heart, though indeed that which seems to be the Empyreume in all
Liquors may perhaps not improbably be suppos'd some such thing as this Vo∣latile
Salt, and may perchance be caus'd only by the exceeding Violence of
Heat.</P>
<P>24. Another way of Discovery is, <HI>by observing with what Circumstances Na∣ture
and Art doe sometimes exceed one another.</HI> For these kind of Observa∣tions
as they discover the Excellencies of the one, so do they also the Defects
of the other, and each of them contributes to the Explication of the other, and
do put the Mind upon Inquiry how to supply those Detects. For instance, that
Crystal and Diamonds are made by Nature of an Hexangular Prismarical Fi∣gure
perfectly transparent and exceeding hard. Art on the other side is able by
Decoctions and Evaporations, to make a Body somewhat transparent, and of
the same Figure, but very soft and brittle, and easily either fufil or dissoluble
again in Water, Namely, Salt Peter. This will prompt one to enquire what
may be the cause of the more perfect Transparency, and of the much greater
Hardness; that is, to find out by what means Niter may be so ordered as to be
made perfectly transparent hard, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ixt: Or else to inquire by what means Crystal
<PB N="60" REF="94"/>
may be made as easily liquefiable as Salt Peter, and by what Menstruum it
may be melted away, as that Salt is into warm Water. Somewhat like the
former of these Inquiries may perhaps have formerly raised in the first Inven∣tors
of Glass a Desire and Endeavour to find out such a way, whereby these
things might be performed, and those Tryals perhaps might produce Glass; as
I think 'tis not to be doubted but that by this means the tinging of Glass into
all kinds of Colours was sought after and found. Another Instance wherein
Art excels Nature, may be in Chymical Distillations and Separations which is
no where naturally done, and the Inquiry how and where this is or may be per∣form'd
by Nature, may prompt unto us perhaps somewhat of the strange Ope∣rations
perform'd in Animals, and stir us up to examine whether those may not
be Nature's Chymical Vessels; and to inquire also by what means those com∣bustible
Substances that cause Lightning and separated from other Vapours col∣lected
together, and afterwards kindled: A Collection therefore of all Expe∣riments
and Observations that seem to shew something of this Nature, will
greatly quicken and excite the Mind, and inform it of what things are mate∣rial
to be inquir'd, and what Circumstances are very significant and in∣structive.</P>
<P>25. Another way of Discovery will be, <HI>to enquire after, to try and enume∣rate
how many mechanical ways there may be of working on, or altering the Pro∣prieties
of several Bodies.</HI> For the being well instructed and knowing in these,
will exceedingly adapt and fit the Mind to trace the Method of Nature, and to
judge which or likeliest to which of those ways Nature performs her Opera∣tions
inquir'd after; it will much rectify the Imagination, and take it off from
an Inclination to unconceivable and confused Apprehensions of things. Thus,
methinks, the Operation of corrosive Menstruums on Metals, or dissoluble Bodies,
may hint to us a way how the Air may operate on combustible Bodies,
or such as are dissoluble by Air exceedingly heated. Thus the Observations
that by the cutting off a part of any Stone from one side of it, does alter the
Center of Gravity, of it: And that a Musical String, wherever it be stopp'd, if
it be struck does make the longest Vibrations in the middle, may prompt unto
us perhaps somewhat of the Reason of the changing of the Poles of the Mag∣net
upon the paring off one side. Were this way well practised, certainly Men
would not have such strange, wild and unconceivable Notions of the Works
and Effects of Nature: For as it seems to do nothing unintelligibly, so are
there very many things that it manifestly performs mechanically: For instance,
all Animal Motions and the Instruments thereto belonging. We should there∣fore
endeavour to be acquainted with all the various mechanical ways of Ham∣mering,
Pressing, Pounding, Grinding, Rowling, Cutting, Sawing, Filing,
Steeping, Soaking, Dissolving, Heating, Burning, Freezing, Melting, and the
like; of which there are various other Species, and each of these have Multi∣tudes
of Individual ways, very much differing from one another, as many of
which as can be attain'd unto, should be understood and examin'd to inform
and regulate the Conceptions of the Mind, and to remove those Puerile and
Childish Fancies that we suck'd with our Milk, and learnt with our Lan∣guage.</P>
<P>26. Another Help of Discovery will be, <HI>to inquire out, and try how many
various mechanical ways there may be of separating Bodies joyn'd and mixt.</HI> Such
as Winnowing, Straining, Wringing, and Pressing, Washing, Distilling, Eva∣porating,
Precipitating, Subliming, Crystallizing, Burning, Coppelling, Freez∣ing,
Shaking, Knocking, and the like; each of which will furnish the Mind
with their differing Circumstances and Proprieties, so as by comparing those
various kinds of Separations in the workings of Nature, with these it will be
the better inabled to judge to which of them they have most Resemblance,
and will be better fitted to detect in what Circumstances they vary, or are
differing from them; and the easier understand what Particulars are notable
and what are not.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="95"/>
27. Another Help of Discovery will be, <HI>to inquire and try how many various
mechanical ways there may be of uniting, and incorporating Bodies into one ano∣ther.</HI>
Such as Jointing, Binding, Screwing, Pinning, Hooking, Shaking, Tum∣bling,
Churming, Kneading, Melting, Dissolving (for the Dissolution of some
parts seem caus'd by the uniting of others) to which may be adjoyn'd Burning,
in which there seems to be several Unitings as well as Separations; Digesting,
Infusion, Freezing, Insolation, by mixing a third or fourth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by taking a∣way
an Impeding part by Compression, by opening and divers other ways and
Methods, some of which are more obvious and visible, others more secret and
obscure, and themselves will need further Explications: All which ways
should, if possible, be well understood and reduc'd to a certain Theory, that so
by that means other more subtile and curious workings of Nature, might by
the Help of them be more exactly detected and defin'd.</P>
<P>28. Another way of Discovery is, <HI>to seek after and attempt by tryal all such
ways, whereby Bodies are really chang'd from one thing to another.</HI> And for this
purpose it matters not whether it be from worse to better, or from better to
worse, or neither: For each, as to this Design, may be alike useful. Of this
kind may be such Bodies as are chang'd by all sorts of Corruptions, Vegeta∣tions,
Animations, Vitrifications, Incorporations, Combustions, Digestions, and
several other Chymical Operations; or any other Mechanical and Artificial
way whatsoever, whereby all or any of the former Proprieties or sensible Qua∣lities
are really changed and destroyed, and new ones generated in their Stead,
such as the Alteration of their Consistence, Colour, Bulk, Gravity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> An
Instance of this may be the Body produced by the melting together of Tin and
Copper, which make a third Body quite distinct in most of its Proprieties from
either of those other two; 'tas quite a distinct Colour from either; 'tis of a
Consistence abundantly harder than either; 'tis exceeding brittle; whereas the
others are both tuff, 'tis much heavier in Specie than either of them, and so for
divers other Proprieties, it seems wholly differing from either of the two Ingre∣dients
of which it is compounded.</P>
<P>And lastly, A most general Help of Discovery in all kind of Philosophical
Inquiry is, <HI>to attempt to compare the working of Nature in that particular that
is under Examination, to as many various, mechanical and intelligible ways of
Operations as the Mind is furnisht with.</HI> For this will not only make the Mind
very attent, and earnest, and circumspect, in observing, but will also hint
many considerable Circumstances to be inquir'd after, and Experiments for
examining and explicating of them: And which is much more than either, will
hugely assist the Ratiocination and Invention in detecting the true Causes of
things. As burning compar'd with Dissolution, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>These are some of the various ways by which Nature may be trac'd, by
which we may be able to find out the material Efficient and Instrumental Cau∣ses
of divers Effects, not too far removed beyond the reach of our Senses, and
which do not very much differ from such Effects as are more material and ob∣vious
to our Senses. But as for the Discovery of the more internal Texture
and Constitution, as also of the Motion, Energy, and operating Principle of
Concret Bodies, together with the Method and Course of Nature's proceeding
in them: These will require much deeper Researches and Ratiocinations, and
very many Vicissitudes of Proceedings from Axiomes to Experiments, and from
Experiments to Axiomes; and are indeed the Business of the Philosopher, and
not of the Historian, the Method of which I intend, God willing, to handle
in the second part of this Philsophical Algebra; which explains the way of
making use of the <HI>Penus Analytica,</HI> of raising Axiomes, and more general De∣ductions
from a sufficient Stock of Materials collected according to the Me∣thod
of this first part, with Integrity, Judgment, and Care.</P>
<P>Having thus past over cursorily the Methods and Means of Inquiry, we will
next consider the Manner and Order of entring what things are to be Registred,
and in what manner, and to be rejected as useless or noxious.</P>
<P>In the making of all kind of Observations or Experiments there ought to be
a huge deal of Circumspection, to take notice of every the least perceivable
<PB N="62" REF="96"/>
Circumstance that seems to be significant either in the promoting or hindering,
or any ways influencing the Effect. And to this end, as I mentioned before, it
were very desirable that both Observations and Experiments should be divers
times repeated, and that at several Seasons and with several Circumstances,
both of the Mind and of Persons, Time, Place, Instruments and Materials:
For all these do very much contribute to the Discovery of Circumstances. And
an Observer should endeavour to look upon such Experiments and Observations
that are more common, and to which he has been more accustom'd, as if they
were the greatest Rarity, and to imagine himself a Person of some other Coun∣try
or Calling, that he had never heard of, or seen any thing of the like before:
And to this end, to consider over those Phoenomena and Effects, which being
accustom'd to, he would be very apt to run over and flight, to see whether a
more serious considering of them will not discover a Significancy in those things
which because usual were neglected: For I am very apt to believe, that if this
Course were taken we should have much greater Discoveries of Nature made
than have been hitherto. For I find it very common for Tradesmen, or such as have been much versed about any thing, to give the worst kind of Description
of it for this purpose; and one that is altogether ignorant and a Stranger to it,
if he be curious and inquisitive, to make the most perfect and full Description
of it. And the like may be observed also in such as travel into other Countries,
that they will give a better Description of the Place than such as are Natives
of it; for those usually take notice of all the things which because of their
Newness seem strange, whereas a Native passes over those because accustom'd
to them. I grant that a Native, or one that has been more accustom'd and
vers'd in a thing or place, shall be able to answer Questions propounded much
better: But a Stranger shall be best able to make the Queries; every Experi∣menter
and Observator therefore should endeavour to be himself both the In∣quirer
and the Answerer, he should indeavour to make himself as knowing
and as much vers'd in any thing he is to describe, and to suppose himself as ig∣norant
and unacquainted as if wholly a Stranger: For as the one will make
him inquisitive, so the other will inable him to solve his Doubts. And that his
Attention may be the more weakned and rous'd, it will be necessary that he
should look upon every Circumstance as the most significant and essential to the
producing the Effect, and to continue so to do till he find sufficient Reason to
the contrary, by having thoroughly consider'd and examin'd it: For though II
confess that this his Supposal will be often frustrated, yet I dare assure him, that
it will divers times also prove much otherwise, as I have very often found.
And 'tis one considerable Step towards Science, to know the Negative Proper∣ties
of things, for by that means the Affirmative Properties are made somewhat
more defin'd and circumscrib'd.</P>
<P>Now what I have here spoken of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Registering Experiments.</NOTE> Attention and Diligence in making Obser∣vations
and Experiment, the same I would have also in registring; at first let
all Circumstances be entred as considerable, unless they are so very obviously
otherwise that they appear so at the first examining of them, but yet even in that
case also 'tis good to be a little doubtful that possibly something may be at first
overseen, which being discover'd would cause other Thoughts and Opinions of
it; they can be easily struck out, as soon as they are by further Observations
or Experiments prov'd insignificant, and if entred in few words they will not
take much room; besides there are very many things, which though perhaps
insignificant to the present End or Design, may yet be very notable to some
other. If it be found such, 'twill be very good when obliterated in one place,
to be inscrib'd in another, where at least it may keep its place till some other
thing much more significant to the same purpose, may give occasion to dis∣place
it.</P>
<P>Now Observations, Experiments, or Circumstances are not to be esteem'd ac∣cording
to the common Opinion of the World, nor are they to be look'd upon
as they are curious or not, or pleasant, or strange, or gainful, or sumptuous,
or esteem'd by the great, the grave, the otherwise Learned part of the World,
or any of those other kinds of Valuations which are put upon them for other
ends, and by Persons altogether unable to judge of their Significancy as to this
great and useful Design: But he that is a true Philosophical Historian, will
<PB N="63" REF="97"/>
find quite other Reasons to advance their Value and six his Esteem of them.
He may perhaps see Cause to account those the most precious and rich, which
are generally esteem'd the most vile and sordid; he may perhaps discover that
to be the richest Ambergrease, which another takes for Grease fit for naught
but to noint his Shoes: Those things which others count Childish and Foolish,
he may find Reasons to think them worthy his most attentive, grave and se∣rious
Thoughts; and those things which some are pleased to call Swingswangs
to please Children, have been found to discover Irregularities even in the Motion
of the Sun it self. Other things which the Generality would account an Em∣ployment
about Niceties and Trifles, he finds to be the shortest and easiest way to
his Journey's end, and from the missing of the Hundred part of a Grain, perhaps
in his Statical Experiment, finds the Mass of Metal to be many Hundred
Pounds worse for Allay: And from the turning of a Straw, is able to foresee a
Change in the great Ocean of the Air. He ought therefore to fortify himself
against these kinds of Prejudices, which are too to apt to obtrude into his Mind,
and preposses him against a clear View and Observation of Circumstances as
they are in their own Nature, or as they are significant to the Design of perfect∣ing
Philosophy, and not to neglect or pass by any of them as trivial, or child∣ish,
or filthy, or base and mean, and the like; but having always his main
End or Aim before his Eyes, to make that the Touchstone, whereby to find the
Value of all his Inventions.</P>
<P>And as these things are not to sway him in the things of his own Invention,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Influence Authority ought to have.</NOTE>
so neither should they have any Influence upon him, as to those things which
he receives from others, Authority therefore should have no other Argument
of Prevalency, but as it was affirmed by an inquisitive, judicious, and most strict∣ly
veracious Person; one that is not found to vent Affirmations rashly or neg∣ligently,
or for any other by Respect, but meerly for the sake of Truth, and
because he had by Observation or Tryal found it so, or for some very conside∣rable
reason believed it such; one that is very circumspect in chusing and pla∣cing
his Words, and that is not observ'd to use too much the Superlative De∣gree,
nor to be too confidently positive in his Assertion. Wheresoever therefore
any thing is registred upon the Authority of another, there ought to be put in
the Margin a C, a P, or a D, according as the Authority is Certain, Probable
or Doubtful: Nor needs there any other Naming since they are only to be re∣spected
according to one of these Considerations, or at most nothing but the
bare Name of the Person. For 'tis not Epithets taken from Antiquity or No∣velty,
or Honour, or Greatness, or Will, or Eloquence, or any other Learning
but Experimental, that will be significantly added upon this Account: And
therefore a Philosophical Historian should indeavour to look through all those
Visards, and to see only what Truth or Probability at least he can spy under∣neath;
beside, that such kind of Additions fill Space, and so expand the Hi∣story
into a wider Space, whereas it ought to be compris'd, as I shall after∣wards
shew in as little room as possible, so as to appear and come under View
all at once that the Eye may the more quickly pass over it from one Particular
to another, as I shall afterwards more fully explain.</P>
<P>The next thing to be taken care of is the manner of Registring:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third part of the manner of Registring Natural Histo∣ries.</NOTE> And this,
as it ought to be done as fast as the Experiment is made, and as soon as the Ob¦servations
or Circumstances occur, because of the Frailty of the Memory, and
the great Significancy there may be in some of the meanest and smallest Cir∣cumstances;
so ought they afterwards to be several times reviewed and exa∣min'd,
and rang'd into a better Method, and abbreviated in the manner of De∣scription;
so that as nothing be wanting in the History, so nothing also be su∣perfluous
in the words. In the Choice of which, there ought to be great Care
and Circumspection, that they be such as are shortest and express the Matter
with the least Ambiguity, and the greatest Plainness and Significancy, not aug∣menting
the Matter by Superlatives, nor abating it by Diminutives, not incli∣ning
it to this or that Hypothesis, or accommodating it to this or that Author's
Opinion; avoiding all kinds of Rhetorical Flourishes, or Oratorical Garnishes, and
all sorts of Periphrases or Circumlocutions, omitting the Citations of Au∣thors,
or the Recital of Opinions, and Sayings, or the like; in the second Re∣view
and Writing of which, 'twill not be amiss to write it in a very fine piece
<PB N="64" REF="98"/>
of Paper, and to enter it in the most compendious manner of writing that the
Historian is acquainted with, such as some very good Short-hand or Abbrevia∣tion,
whereby the whole History may be contracted into as little Space as is
possible; for this, as I shall more fully explain in my second part, is of huge
Use in the Prosecution of Ratiocination and Inquiry, and is a vast Help to
the Understanding and Memory, as in Geometrical Algebra, the expressing of
many and very perplex Quantities by a few obvious and plain Symbols: And
therefore 'twere to be wisht, that we could express the whole History in as
few Letters or Characters as it has considerable Circumstances, somewhat of
the manner of doing Which in my second Part.</P>
<P>Now these Histories being writ in brief, in a small piece of very fine Paper,
'twill be very convenient to have a large Book bound after the manner of those
that are very usual for keeping Prints, Pictures, Drawings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in, to preserve
them smooth and in order: On the sides of which, in the same manner as those
Pictures are kept, it would be convenient to stick on with Mouth Glew, or
some such Substance in the best Method that can be thought of for the pre∣sent:
the several small Schedules containing the abbreviated and complicated
Histories of Observations or Experiments, as they are last written on fine Paper,
for by the Contrivance of this Book, which for Brevity's sake I will call a Re∣pository,
not only all the Histories belonging to any one Inquiry may be placed
so as to appear all at one View, there being two large sides of Paper to be fill'd
with these Schedules: But they may at any time, upon occasion, be presently
remov'd or alter'd in their Position or Order, that which was plac'd first may be
plac'd middle-most, or last, or transpos'd to another Head, or a little remov'd
to suffer another to be interpos'd, the Convenience of which will quickly upon
Tryal be found to be very great, as also it has another Convenience that many
of those Schedules which seem to be of the same Significancy may for a time
be placed all one over another, and so at last the choicest and most excellent
of them may be preserv'd and plac'd in their room, and all the rest as supera∣bundant,
and in particular less significant of the same thing may be remov'd
elsewhere, of which an inquisitive and diligent Historian will very often find
great Use. On these large sides he may place them either according to the Me∣thod
of the Queries, which he has at first propounded to himself, or according
to their first appearing Plainness, or Difficulty, or after any other Method of
Inquiry, or Proceeding, which every one will be best able to adapt for himself,
according to the Subject whereon he makes his Inquiry, or according to his par∣ticular
Aim and Scope in examining it, or according to the Knowledge he has
already acquir'd in it.</P>
<P>As for the Queries which he at first propounds to himself to be examin'd on
that Subject, he intends the History of, those will be most conveniently written
either in some other small long Book, or else better in a single Sheet of Paper,
either of which may at the same time be expos'd to the View with the Schedules
on the sides of the larger Repository, and as 'twill be no great Labour to write
over the one anew according as further Information shall give occasion to add
or alter Queries, so 'twill be much less to transpose and range the Method and
Order of the Schedules in the Repository.</P>
<P>Now because oftentimes much more may be expressed in a small Picture of
the thing, than can be done by a Description of the same thing in as many
words as will fill a Sheet; it will be often necessary to add the Pictures of
those Observables that fill not otherwise be so fully and sensibly exprest by
Verbal Description: But in the doing of this, as a great Art and Circumspection
is to be used in the Delineation, so ought there to be very much Judgment and
Caution in the use of it. For the Pictures of things which only serve for Or∣nament
or Pleasure, or the Explication of such things as can be better describ'd
by words is rather noxious than useful, and serves to divert and disturb the
Mind, and sways it with a kind of Partiality or Respect: Besides that, it fills
up room, and occupies the Mind with the Ideas of things which are little
significant in the present Inquiry.</P>
<P>And therefore all those kind of Pictures of the outward Forms and Beauties,
and Varieties of the Species of Nature, are to be referred to another Head,
<PB N="65" REF="99"/>
where indeed they will prove very significant, but to a peculiar kind of Inquiry,
as I shall shew more at large in my second part. All things indeed ought to
be registred very exactly and defin'd and determin'd all according to their
Proportions in Number, Weight, Measure, Time, Place, and Circumstances;
but all in brief, and yet sufficiently significant.</P>
<P>Together with these Schedules of History, 'twill be convenient to interpose
small Schedules of particular Deductions, or Conjectures, or Queries, or Causes
of Doubt, or receiv'd Hypotheses, and the like; but these, as they should be
exprest in a very few words, so that they may be the more obvious, and may
thereby the less disturbe the Mind in its Inquiry: So 'twill be best to have them
written with an Ink of some other Colour, as Red or Green, or the like; for
this will much assist the Memory and Ratiocination, as I shall afterwards ma∣nifest
more at large.</P>
<P><HI>The Promise of our Author at the end of the foregoing Discourse of prosecuting,
and more particularly explaining the way of ranging Observations and Experiments,
so as to make them more convenient for Use, as occasion offers, was I believe never
performed: for I never heard or met with any of that Subject, and as to the
reasoning part of his Philosophick Algebra, that likewise was not wrote, only
there is something to that purpose in several of his Geometrick Lectures read</HI>
Anno 1680. <HI>wherein he shews the Excellency of the Method observed by</HI> Euclid
<HI>in his Elements, which he enlarges upon; shewing how from a few self-evident
Axiomes and Definitions, and</HI> Postulata easy to be granted, a vast Structure of
undeniable Truths have been raised, and that from the Method of not leaving
any thing undemonstrated behind, but still proceeding on, steadily and firmly a
Notioribus ad minus nota; <HI>which Method, if exactly observed in Philosophical
Inquiries, the whole Pile would be founded and built upon so sure a Foundation
as never to be shaken. And in order to this, he prefers generally the</HI> Synthetick
<HI>Method as the most instructive and perfective of the Understanding and Reason,
tho he sometimes proceeds by the</HI> Analytick, <HI>Specimens of each of which will be
seen in several of the following Lectures, wherefore I shall forbear to enlarge
upon them in this place, since the Prefaces to the particular Lectures will with
more Benefit inform the Reader what use he made of them: And likewise of what
Use, if not Necessity,</HI> Theories <HI>and pre-conceived Hypotheses are (contrary to the
Opinion of some Learned Persons) in order to the making more proper Observa∣tions,
contriving and ordering more convenient Experiments, and inventing more
fit Instruments for that purpose, the more accurately and nicely to determine whe∣ther
the suppos'd Theory be true or false; all which Observations without such a
preconceived Supposition, would either have been past by unheeded, and several
material Particulars unobserved, and Experiments wanderingly made; or as Chance
offered them, and not made with so much Care and Circumspection, and Instruments
and other necessary Apparatus not well contrived sord etermining the Enquiry; yet
he still asserts all should be done with great Candor, and without Fondness for any</HI>
Theory, <HI>which should be taken up only to discover Truth, and as easily laid down
again if found not agreeable to Truth. For a farther Account of his Opinion in
this Matter, I refer the inquisitive Reader to the several places where this Sub∣ject
happens to be discoursed of, and more particularly to a Lecture about determi∣ning
the Oval Figure of the Terraqueous Globe, and Encompassing Atmosphere,
whether it be an Oblong or a Prolated Spheroeid, and of determining the Question
whether the</HI> Axis <HI>of the Earth's Rotation has or does successively, tho' very slowly
alter, which Lectures were read the beginning of the Year 1687. and follow in their
proper place.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I shall only as a Specimen of these Geometrick Lectures above-mentioned, give
the Reader some few Abstracts of some of our Author's Explications: Since I judge▪
it needless to publish his Lectures on that Subject at large, the Elements of Geo∣metry
having been already illustrated and set forth by several eminent Persons
and that in different Methods, and the first I shall offer is what our Author has
delivered concerning the Definition of a Point, viz. R. W.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A Point is that which hath no part.</HI> This which some would deem the most
inconsiderable thing in the World, seems yet the most difficult to be under∣stood;
<PB N="66" REF="100"/>
no Sense, or Imagination, or Fant'cy, can reach it, nor words describe
it, but by a Negative, to tell you what it is not: For it is not to be taken in
the Sense, that the whole Earth is called a Point in respect of the Universe,
nor in the Sense that the End of a tapering thing is called a Point, as of a Pin
or Needle, tho' they seem to be the smallest things we know, because these la∣ter
may be said to have as many parts as the fore-mentioned; for since all Quan∣tity
is divisible <HI>in infinitum,</HI> the least (Quantity may be divided as often as the
greatest, and therefore whatever is divisible must have Parts, and therefore none
of these can be properly called a Point, in the Sense here named, unless this
Point be understood to be the <HI>Apex</HI> of a Mathematical Cone or Pyramid, where
the Superficies of it is determined, for that will be a Mathematical Point:
But it cannot be supposed of a Physical Point, or Material Cone, or Pyramid,
for that will have Extension and Bluntness. And we find that Microscopes
will make those Points divisible even to Sense, nay even almost to discover a
new World in a Point, nay there is one now that affirms he has seen more than
10000 Living Creatures in the Bigness of a very small Sand, which it self in∣deed
is but a visible Point to the naked Eye, and each of those 10000 may have Worlds
within them. We know not the Limits of Quantity, Matter, and
Body as to its Divisibility or Extension, no Imagination can comprehend the
<HI>Maximum</HI> or the <HI>Minimum Naturae,</HI> our Faculties are finite and limited, and
we must content our selves within the Orb and Sphere of their Activity. And
acquiesce in a Negative Definition, and understand if we can somewhat that is
smaller than the smallest, though that be also improper; for in that which is
not Quantity, there is neither smaller nor bigger, we must endeavour to under∣stand
somewhat infinitely little, less than which there cannot be, somewhat
that has no Bigness or Extension, or Quantity, but only Position and Respect
to Quantities circumjacent: From which, to this or that Body, there is a de∣terminate
Length and Distance; and upon this account, wherever we endea∣vour
to understand this Notion, our Imagination will represent to us the smal∣lest
visible Body, as an exceeding fine Sand, or a Mite, or the Point of a Nee∣dle,
or the smallest visible Body we have ever seen on Paper, or the like;
which we must be content with since the Fantcy forms nothing but what is
first in the Sense, though it be none of these. And in truth it can have no
true Definition that will reach its Essence. Analogous to this Point, Sign or
nothing in Quantity is the <HI>Nought</HI> Cifer, or <HI>Zero</HI> in Number, the never in
time. The Rest or Quiet in Motion: For as no Aggregate of Points will ever
produce a Line or a Quantity, so the Multiplication of Noughts or Cifers will
never produce a Number, and as the Addition of Nevers cannot make time,
so the Aggregate of Rests cannot produce a Motion. So that all these may not
improperly be called the <HI>Terminus</HI> or Bound, from which they all begin, so
Quantity may be said to begin from a Point or nothing. Number may be said
to beigin from Nought Cifer or Zero, Time may be said to begin from Never,
and Motion to begin from Rest: And as the <HI>Minimum Naturae</HI> may be said to
be the first Quantity, if at least there be a <HI>Minimum</HI> in Nature, so a Unite
may express it in Numbers, Instant in Time, and Moment in Velocity. It may
possibly be thought I have said too much of nothing, but yet it seems to be of
the greatest Consideration in Nature; for it seems to be the beginning of every
Creature, even the greatest Creatures having been traced to begin from an At∣tom
or Point, no Eye or Sense can reach it, nor any Understanding limit it,
that the beginning of a very large Animal hath been seen alive 10000 times
smaller than a Mite may be proved, and yet how much smaller it may have
been is not determined.</P>
<P>Now as these express Incomprehensibles one way, as to their Beginning or
Centrality, so the Incomprehensibles the other way which may be called Circum∣ferential,
may be expressed by Infinity, Abyss or Immensity for Quantity or Exten∣sion,
Innumerability for Number, Eternity for Time, and Instantaneous for Mo∣tion:
But those are beyond our Reach, and yet even of those there is a neces∣sary
Use in Geometry; and without which several of the most considerable De∣monstrations
both in that and Arithmetick cannot be performed, but of these
elsewhere. When I come to consider Infinity and Innumerability, when I shall
show that innumerable Points do make a Mathematical Line, innumerable Lines
<PB N="67" REF="101"/>
do make a Mathematical Superficies, innumerable Superficies do make a Ma∣thematical
Body, innumerable Moments make a Velocity, innumerable Instants
make Mathematical Time, by supposing Motion joyn'd to them: For a Point
moved makes a Line in a Mathematical Sense, a Line moved makes a Plain, a
Plain moved that makes a Body, and contrary Motion reduce them back again,
which is exprest or perform'd by Multiplication and Division.</P>
<P><HI>I shall beg the Candid Readers Patience to add one Remark more of the Doctors
on the Method of</HI> Euclid, <HI>and that is of his Method of Demonstration, and that
in two very easy Problems,</HI> viz. <HI>the Prop.</HI> 1. <HI>and</HI> 2. <HI>Lib. 1. which I hope for some
Observations and Hints, particularly as to the Analyticks of the Ancients will not
be altogether unacceptable.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Euclid</HI> having premis'd his Principles, he begins his Method of Demonstra∣tion,
in which he takes no more for granted than what he hath already laid
down as easy and self-evident. His first Proposition then is upon a right Line,
given to make an Equilateral Triangle. He hath defined in the 4th Definition
what he means by a right Line, namely, that which lieth straight between the
two Extremes of it which are Points, and what he means by an Equilateral
Triangle, namely, such a one which hath all its three Sides equal to one ano∣ther.</P>
<P>This first Proposition is a Problem, which explains a way how to do and
perform the thing required, as well as shews how to manifest the Truth and
Certainty of the thing done: It contains therefore and shews a double Inven∣tion,
without which, or some such other thing, the Proposition can neither be
done, nor demonstrated; which Inventions are called Mediums or Means by
which we attain to the end propounded or desired. The end here sought is how
from the ends of a Linen give to draw two other Lines each equal to the given
Line, which shall meet in one and the same Point: It is certain that these
Lines must begin from the ends of the first Line given, but which of these to
draw first, and which way, with what Inclination to the former Line, that is,
with what Angle, that is not yet known, and some Invention must be thought
of how to direct our Ruler to draw it. Well, how shall this be done, since
there may be infinite of Lines drawn from each of those Points which shall eve∣ry
one of them be equal to this Line given? How then shall we among those
Infinite or Indefinite Number chuse out the right? 'tis impossible, without some Invention.
Our Author therefore helps you to one, and one which you have
already granted to be feasable in the third Petition upon the Center a, and Di∣stance,
a b, draw a Circle, says he, b g c h f b,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plate 1st. Fig. 2 d.</NOTE> what then? To what purpose?
Why this Circle then will give you a Line in which are contain'd all the
Points or Ends of the infinite Lines, which may be drawn from the Point a any
ways that shall be equal to a b How so? Why by the 15th Definition you are
taught, that a Circle is a plain Figure bounded by or contain'd within one
Curve Line, which is called the Circumference, to which every right Line
drawn from a Point in the middle, which is called the Center, are equal to one
another: But what are we yet the wiser? How do we know which of these infi∣nite
Lines we are to draw? To which of these infinite Points that are in this
Circumference? To know this, you must do the same thing upon the Point b,
that is, upon the Point b and Distance b a. Draw or describe the Circle a d
c e f a, which will give you all the possible infinite Points in that Plain; to
which the from the Point b right Lines may be drawn equal to b a. Now then
since these Circles contain all the possible Points of the Lines equal to a b or
b a, that can be drawn from a or b. It follows, that where those Circles
intersect there only must be the Point to which those Lines may be drawn;
namely, at c and at f and no where else soever: Drawing therefore Lines
from a and from b to either of those Points c or f as a c, b c, or a f, b f,
you have done the thing that was propounded, namely, upon the Line a b,
given you have made an Equilateral Triangle a b c or a b f, which was de∣sired.
This is the first part of the Problem, and indeed the difficultest to
find out; namely, how to do the thing required, and in this part lie the
greatest Difficulties of Mathematical Knowledge, to wit, in the finding out the
proper and true Mediums or Means to perform the Problems requir'd to be
done, which for the most part are of the same Nature with this, and consist in
<PB N="68" REF="102"/>
the finding out the Position of a Point; for this Problem might have been thus
worded. A right Line being given as a b; to find a Point as c or f, to which
Lines being drawn from the Points a and b, they shall each of them be equal
to one another, and to the Line a b which is given; or two Points a and b be∣ing
given to find a third Point, as c or f, which shall have the same Distance
from a and from b that they have from one another. But our Author not ha∣ving
given any Definition of Distance or Equality, otherwise than may be col∣lected
from Equality of the sides of some Figure, or of the Rays or Lines
drawn from the Center to the Circumference of a Circle, he chuses rather to make
use of an Equilateral Triangle to find out that Propriety of a Point so posited.
What ways the Ancients had for finding out these Mediums or Means of per∣forming
or doing the thing required, we are much in the dark: Nor do any of
them shew the way, or so much as relate that they had such a one; yet 'tis be∣lieved
they were not ignorant of some kind of Algebra,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I do not any where find that this was ever done by Dr.</HI> Hooke, <HI>and leave the Vsefulness thereof to be considered by the Learned.</HI></NOTE> “by which they had a
certain way to help themselves in their Inquiries, though that we now use
be much confined and limited to a few Media. But I do rather conceive,
that they had another kind of Analyticks, which went backwards through
almost the same Steps by which their Demonstrations went forwards, though
of this we have no certain Account, their Writings being altogether silent
in that particular. However, that such a way is practicable, I may here∣after
upon some other Occasion shew by some Examples: Whereby it will
plainly appear how much more useful it is for the finding out the ways for
Solutions of Problems, than that which is now generally known and pra∣ctised
by Species.” But this only here by the by, our present Business being
to go through all the parts of this first Problem of our Author. The second
part then of the Proposition is the Demonstrative part thereof, namely, to prove
from the Principles already laid down and granted and assented unto for true
and certain, by a clear Chain of Reasoning and Deduction, that these Lines
a c and b c or a f and b f, are each of them equal to a b, and so equal to one
another; and consequently that the Figure a b c bounded and limited by them
is an Equilateral Triangle, according to the Description of their Figure in the
24 Definition. The next thing then to be invented or found out is the Me∣dium
or Means of demonstrating it to be such, for this we have two. First,
the Definition of the Proprieties of the Lines from the Center of a Circle to the
Circumference in the 15 Definition, that they are all equal to one another:
And Secondly, We have the first Axiome, those which are equal to one other
are equal to one another. First, a b is equal to a c, because they are right
Lines drawn from the Center a to the Circumference b g c h; for by the 15
Definition, as I said, all such Lines must be equal next b a, and b c must upon
the same account be equal to one another, because they also are Lines drawn
from the Center b to the Circumference a d c e: Therefore both a c and b c
are equal to a b, but by the first Axiome those which are equal to one other are
equal to one another, therefore a c and b c are also equal to one another.
Therefore the three sides of the Figure a b c, namely, a b, a c, and b c, are
equal to one another, and consequently bound an Equilateral Triangle accor∣ding
to the 24 Definition, therefore upon the Line a b given an Equilateral
Triangle is made, which was the thing to be done and proved.</P>
<Q>The second Proposition is also a Problem.</Q>
<P>From a Point given to draw a right Line, which shall be equal to ano∣ther
right Line, given. For the performing of this Proposition, it being a
Problem, there is need of two Mediums to be invented or found out; the
first is for the doing of the thing required, and the second for the Demonstra∣tion
of it, and both these are to be fetcht out of the Principles already agreed
to, or from the Truth evidenced in the preceding Proposition: For we are not
to suppose any thing further known in this Science, and therefore much less
are we to make use of it. Searching therefore our Store, we have no other
Medium to make a Line equal to a Line, than first by the Help of a Circle,
defined Definition the 15. which by the third <HI>Postulatum</HI> is granted to be de∣scribable
upon any Center, and at any Distance: Or 2dly, by an Equilateral
<PB N="69" REF="103"/>
Triangle described Definition 24, which we learnt how to make by the pre∣ceding
Problem: For as to the equal sides of an Equilateral Triangle, Defini∣tion
25, or the equal sides of a Square, a Parallelogram or oblong Square,
<HI>Rhombus</HI> or <HI>Romboeides</HI> described Definition the 30, 31, 32, and 33. Though their
Proprieties are there defined, yet we are not taught how to make them as yet,
and consequently can make no use of them, as <HI>Media</HI> to perform the thing re∣quired
to be done by this Problem: Nor are we to suppose, that the length of
the Line given may be taken by the help of a Measure or a pair of Compasses,
and transferred to the Point given; because those are first not mentioned in the
Principles laid down there which you are to make use of, and of no other, till
they be accepted for Principles undeniable: For 'tis not yet granted, that you
can with Compasses, take a true Length of a Line, much less that you can
transfer it and set it in another Place. But you have granted that 'tis possible,
upon a Point given at any Distance, to describe a Circle, or suppose it so done,
which is sufficient for the Demonstration, that being the principal thing aim'd
at by our Author; Namely, to lay open to the Understanding, the Reasons and
Grounds of the Proprieties of Quantities so and so qualify'd, that you may
plainly see how and for what Cause things are thus or thus and cannot be other∣wise:
For as to the most practicable and expedite ways of doing those things
Mechanically, and for other Uses, that belongs to another part of Mathema∣ticks;
namely, to the practical Part thereof, which is called Practical Geome∣try
or Mechanical Geometry, which ought not to be Learned till this be first
known, but this which our Author treats of is Speculative Geometry, and prin∣cipally
aims at Demonstrations or explaining the Proprieties of Quantities to
the Understanding. You saw clearly by the former Proposition why a b c was
as equilateral Triangle, and why there could be but two such made upon the
Line a b in the same Plain; there being but two Points wherein those Circles
cut each other, those Circles determining all the Lines equal to a b that can
be drawn from the Points a and b. His way then of performing this Problem
is this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plate 1st. Fig. 3.</NOTE> Let the Right Line given be a b in the third Figure, and the Point gi∣ven
be c, from which Point a right Line is to be drawn equal to the Line a b.
First draw a Line from b to c, which is granted possible by the first Postulatum,
then by the former Proposition upon this Line, b c make an equilateral Trian∣gle
b c d, then upon the Center b and Distance a b describe a Circle, as a g by
the third Postulatum; then by the second Postulatum produce d b to the Cir∣cumference
e, then upon the Center d and Distance d e, draw the Circle e h;
then as before, produce the Line d c to the Circumference f, then shall c f be
the Line required to be drawn from the Point c equal to the Line given a b.
This is the Construction of the Problem, or the preparing of the Proposition
fit for Demonstration, by which you may clearly understand the Reasons of
it, deduced from the few Principles already laid down: For first, that a b is
equal to e b is clear from the 15 Definition, which determines the Propriety
of Equality of the Rays of a Circle. Next that d b e is equal to d c f, is as
clear from the same Definition, they being both Rays or Lines drawn from the
Center d to the Circumference e h by the Construction premised. Thirdly,
That d b is equal to d c, is clear from the Construction; for d b c is an Equi∣lateral
Triangle, two of whose sides d b and d c are. Now by the third Axiom
or common Notion, if from equal Quantities you take equal Quantities, the Re∣mainders
shall be equal; if from d f you take d c, and from d e d b the
Remainder c f shall be equal to the Remainder b e; but a b is also by the
Construction equal to b e, therefore since by the first Axiom these two Quan∣tities
which are equal to one other Quantity are equal to one another; there∣fore
a b and c f, being equal to b e, are equal also to one another, therefore
from the Point c the Line c f is drawn equal to the Line a b, which was
the thing to be done and proved.</P>
<P>Now though this way of Demonstration and Reasoning may seem tedious
and too long to detain the Mind and Attention in the finding out the Proprie∣ties
of Quantities, yet 'twas the way made use of by the Ancients. And 'tis al∣together
necessary, especially in the beginning of this Study, to accustom the
Mind to Attention and Circumspection, that it may receive nothing for Truth,
but what it sees clearly by the Reasons and Causes of it, that thereby the
<PB N="70" REF="104"/>
Mind may acquire an Habit of Intention, and of examining the whole Chain
of Consequents from the first Principles to the Truth evidenced. For the want
of which, some small Error perhaps may slip into the Mind under the Appear∣ance
of Truth, and thereby make all the subsequent Reasonings and Deducti∣ons
unsound; and 'tis very much harder to clear and free the Mind from it
when once received, than to prevent the Reception thereof. There cannot
therefore (in this Study especially, not now to mention any other, where it is
possible it may be altogether as convenient, nay necessary) there cannot, I say,
therefore be as I conceive too much Circumspection and Caution used in ad∣mitting
Principles, and furnishing the Mind with the true grounds of Know∣ledge;
because for the most part we are too prone to take up every thing we
hear upon Trust: Without Examination, we are too apt to run away with a
thing, and think we know it and see it clearly before we are sure we do, and
are impatient of Delay in examining and considering, whereas if the Mind be
a little at first accustomed to this leisurely and strict way of reasoning, after it
has got a habit it will make as much Dispatch in receiving things with suffi∣cient
Examination, as another shall without it. And the Patience only is need∣ful
for the most part, at first, to beget Attention: Nor is it peculiar to this
Acquisition alone, but we see it necessary, and practised in many other things
where a good habit is to be acquired; as in Reading, Writing, Musick, Draw∣ing,
and most other Manual Operations. The Roots and Beginnings of Know∣ledge
and Practice too are bitter and tedious, but the Fruits are sweet and plea∣sant;
and whosoever attains the end, will never repent the time they spent in
the beginning.</P>
<P>Possibly some Readers may think these Abstracts, out of some of our Authors
Geometrical Lectures, too prolixe; but I hope they will not by all be judg'd wholly
unnecessary, and useless, at least I thought it not amiss to give this Specimen of
our Author's Niceness, as to the admitting of things unproved, for real Truths:
But if this be a fault, I hope what follows in the subsequent Discourses of the
Nature of Light, and other no less curious Subjects, will make sufficient amends. <HI>R. W.</HI></P>

<P>1. I Intend, God willing, this Term to treat of <HI>mixt Geometry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Difficulty of the Subject.</NOTE> as it is
made use of for the Explanation and clearing of some Subject to which
it is applyed, and by Example therein to shew of what Use it may be
in any other Matter that falls within its Reach. And the Subject I have
pitched upon as the first and most obvious, though yet the most abstruse of all
others is <HI>Light:</HI> None that has Eyes can be ignorant of it, and yet there have
<PB N="72" REF="106"/>
been very few, if any, in the World that have hitherto understood and explain∣ed
the true Nature and Cause of it. And though it was the very first thing in
the World to which the Almighty Creator gave his <HI>Fiat,</HI> when he made the World, <HI>fiat Lux,</HI> Let there be Light; yet it may be possibly the last and most
difficult of all sensible things, that may be thoroughly understood. And this
Subject I have the rather begun withal, because from a clear Explanation of
this, several other Subjects, as those of <HI>Gravity, Magnetism, Rarefaction, Con∣densation,
Solidity, Fluidity,</HI> and the like, will be demonstrably evidenced:
Now though Nature hath not furnisht us with distinct and appropriate Organs of
Sense, whereby we may immediately be made sensible of all those Opera∣tions
and Workings of Nature, as no Sense informs us immediately of the Emanations of the <HI>Magnetical</HI> Vertue, no Sense immediately informs us of the In∣struments
or Powers imployed for driving Bodies towards the Center of the Earth;
no Sense informs us of the <HI>Gravitation</HI> or continual Pressure of the <HI>Air;</HI> no Sense informs us immediately of the means of the Conveyance of Light, yet an
inquisitive and observing Man may find Helps enough to assist those Senses
which the Creator has furnisht him with, to discover all those ways and means
made use of, and to demonstrate their Proprieties and Powers as clearly, as it
the Instruments and manner of working were visible and obvious immediately
to some of our Organs of Sense.</P>
<P>To repeat to you all the Definitions and Descriptions thereof in <HI>Authors</HI> that
have treated of it would be endless, and instead of making the Nature of it
more perspicuous, would quite darken and put it out: For the most part of
them have only spoken of it as it were Metaphorically and by Smilitudes, seem∣ing
not to have understood at all themselves what they endeavoured to explain to others: Or at least have treated of it in such general Terms, that in∣stead
of making it more intelligible, they have made it incomprehensible. Such
therefore I shall omit to mention, the Science that they deliver being only
useful for Allegories and Similitudes, and Rhetorical Embellishments, and no
way tending to the Physical Explanation of its Effects and Proprieties.</P>
<P>Certain it is, that the Nature of it seems to be the most abstruse of any thing
we yet know in the Universe; and though most seeing People do believe they
thoroughly understand it, yet if they shall consider more attentively what their
Knowledge of it is, they will begin to think themselves a little in the dark, and to
want some further enlightning to discover that which before they thought so
evident, which will now seem to differ from all other things in Nature.</P>
<P>2. But before I come to these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Opinions of the Ancients.</NOTE> I shall determine the Opinions of some of the
most eminent Philosophers and Mathematicians, which we find either in an∣cient
or Modern Writings, to see how far they have agreed, and in what they
have been deficient in explaining the true Nature of Light.</P>
<P>Amongst these I shall begin with the most ancient, as <HI>Anaximander, Anago∣ras,
Leucippus. Heraclitus, Empedocles, Zeno,</HI> and the <HI>Stoicks, Plato</HI> and his
Followers. All which make Light to be Fire, or a certain Flame issuing from
the Lucid Body, as the Sun, which they suppose the Fountain of Light, and to
be all Fire, Flame, or pure Light: And there <HI>Anaxagoras</HI> call'd it <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
a fiery Mass, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> most pure Fire, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> a vast
Mass of Fire. And wheresoever there was Light, there they suppose Fire,
which produced the Effects of Fire if it were dense enough; but if it were not dense,
it only made things visible, and produced the Effect that we call Light.
This was their Opinion in general, but how they did more particularly explain the
Nature of Light do not now appear; so that in effect we are as much to
seek as to the Knowledge of the true Nature of Light as before: But▪ 'tis but
giving of it another Name, and calling Light by the Name of Fire or Flame,
without telling us what that other thing is which they name. For who under∣stands
what they meant by Fire or Flame, whether the ordinary Fire of Wood, Coles,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> or an Elementary Fire, such as the Peripateticks afterwards suppose;
or a third kind, such as the Mass of the Sun and fixed Stars, or neither of all
these: Because they granted the Moon rises to participate of it, and yet hath
none of its own.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="107"/>
In truth we have no Information from it that is pertinent to this Inquiry I
am now about: For call it Light, or call it Fire, or call it Flame, unless we
knew the Proprieties and Causes of it, it comes all to one thing, it instructs
us not; for how come we thereby to know how this passes from the Sun? For
instance, or from the fixed Stars, some Thousands of times further than the
Sun to our Eye here placed upon the Earth, in an instant? Which Light really
doth (as I shall afterwards endeavour to show.) How comes the Sun, or any
one, nay all the fixt Stars, continually to give out so great a Quantity of
Flame, as every moment to fill the whole Universe; which is an Extension or
Space Millions of Millions of Millions of times bigger than the whole Globe
of the Earth and Sea, and indeed incomprehensible in Greatness, and yet at the
same time the Body of it not sensibly wasted; nay, thus it hath done ever since
the beginning of the World, in every moment of time, and yet by the best Ob∣servations
we can find recorded in Natural Historians and Astronomers, we cannot
learn that the Sun is diminished in Quantity: So that let the Flame be
never so much rarify'd, yet considering it must fill so infinitely vast a Space
every Moment, certainly it must have long before this have rarify'd this Body
all away, this therefore cannot be a true Explication of the Nature of Light. Be∣sides,
we are yet to seek the true Nature of Flame, how that comes to make it self sensible
at a Distance: For though we see a Stick of Wood, for instance,
or a Candle, by means of Heat to be turned into Flame and to be consumed thereby,
so that the whole Substance thereof by degrees is all converted into a
successive Body of Flame, yet how this comes to affect our Sight at so many
Miles distance in an instant, so that at the very Moment the Flame is kindled,
or extinguished; or discovered, or covered, though at 10, 20, or more Miles Di∣stance,
the Eye at the same instant is sensible of these Varieties. Now who can
imagine, that the Body of Flame, which appears at one instant in the top of the
Candle, should at the same instant fill a Hemisphere of the Atmosphere 10,
20, or more Miles in Diameter, and yet it must be concluded so to do if this
be the cause of Light: For there is no Point in all that Hemisphere, in which
if the Eye be placed, the Candle cannot be seen at the very instant 'tis lighted.
This Explication therefore is to me, I confess, wholly inconceivable, and is
complicated with such Difficulties as no true reasoning can make it possible
and intelligible, and therefore as an Absurdity or Impossibility, I must re∣ject
it.</P>
<P>For as in pure Geometry nothing is to be let pass for a Truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nothing is to be allowed in Natural Philosophy but what is solid.</NOTE> whose Cause
and Principles are not clearly shown by the Progress of Reasoning, and the
Process of Demonstration: So in Physicks Geometrically handled, nothing is to
be taken for granted, nor any thing admitted for a true Conclusion, that is not
plainly deduced from self-evident Principles, and those founded upon the im∣mediate
Objects of Sense disintangled from all the Fallacies of the Medium
and Organ. To avoid then in part this unintelligible Expansion of Flame, so
as to fill the whole Sphere of the true Medium incompassing the Lucid Object.
Some later Authors have added, that this Expansion is only superficial, and not
solid, and that the whole Medium is not at the same Moment compleatly
fill'd with this rarify'd Flame, but that the Momentary Emanation of Flame
from the Lucid Point makes a Spherical Superficies, which Spherical Super∣ficies
by an almost instantaneous Motion expands it self every way <HI>in Orbem,</HI>
and successively becomes the Superficies of greater and greater Spheres, till it
attain the Extremities of the Universe, or be at length lost in the Profundities
of the Abyss of Matter. For Explanation of which, they bring the Similitude
of the Rings or Circular Waves upon a stagnating Pond of Water, for as in
that (say they) the Wave made by a Stone, or the like Body falling into the
Water makes a Wave, which very Wave you see expands it self and moves
from that place where the Stone fell, in a Circle that continually grows big∣ger
till it touch the Extremities of the Pond, or <HI>Stagnum</HI> of Water; so that very
Flame which is emitted from the Lucid Body, does by successive Motion, but
yet very rapid, move it self from the Lucid Point to all the Extremities of
the Material World in a Spherical Superficies, which does continually grow
bigger and bigger, and that 'tis only a Superficies as it were that is at once fill'd
by it, and not the whole Sphere; from which Cause, say they, the Eye can be
<PB N="74" REF="108"/>
no where plac'd in the ambient Sphere of Matter, but this increasing Sphere
will affect it and move against it, and thereby make on it an Impression which
we call Light. Now the Body so long as it burns continually emitting such
Spherical Superficies of Flame, which continually follow one another, with
the same, though it be an infinitely rapid Motion and swiftness.</P>
<Q><L>Semper enim nova se radiorum Lumina fundunt,</L>
<L>Prima{que} dispereunt.</L></Q>
<Q>Says <HI>Lucretius.</HI></Q>
<Q>And again in another Place of his Books he adds,</Q>
<Q><L>Suppeditatur enim confessim Lumine Lumen,</L>
<L>Et quasi pro telo stimulatur fulgure fulgur;</L>
<L>Qua propter simulacra pari ratione necesse est</L>
<L>Immemorabile per Spatium transcurrere posse,</L>
<L>Temporis in puncto.</L></Q>
<P>It follows therefore, that the whole Sphere must also be fill'd with them.
This seems to be the Theory which <HI>Epicurus</HI> and the <HI>Atomists</HI> maintain, which
is at large explained by <HI>Gassandus,</HI> and our Learned Dr.<HI>Charleton.</HI></P>
<P>3. But the Difficulties in it are very great; for first, <HI>Epicurus</HI> supposed that
all the Space between the visible Coelestial Bodies was a perfect Vacuity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Insufficien∣cy of the Anci∣ent Opinions.</NOTE> and
only made for the way of these Orbicular Superficies of Light, or Passage of those
Troops of Atomes of which these Orbs consisted; for so <HI>Lucretius</HI> in his
Second Book explains it, speaking of Atomes.</P>
<Q><L>Quae porro magnum per Inane vagantur</L>
<L>Et cita dissiliunt longe; longeq recursant</L>
<L>In magnis Intervallis. Haec aera rarum</L>
<L>Sufficiunt nobis, &amp; splendida Lumina solis.</L></Q>
<P>Now 'tis hard to conceive how such infinitely small Bodies, should with so
rapid a Motion pass so vast a Space in an instant almost, and yet must conti∣nually
in the way through every Point of Distance meet with crossing Spheri∣cal
Surfaces of Light from infinite other Lucid Points, and yet the Passage of
them not to be at all impeded or stopt.</P>
<P><HI>2dly,</HI> 'Tis not yet proved, that there is any such thing as a <HI>vacuum</HI> in Na∣ture;
and <HI>Descartes</HI> supposes that Extension and Body is one and the same
thing, and that there is no where Extension but there is Body, and no Body
but is extended; for which he brings several Arguments, not easy to be fully
answered, which I shall not now insist upon.</P>
<P><HI>3dly,</HI> Though it might be granted, that there were an Extension without a
Body to fill it, and a perfect Vacuity; and so the Atomes or Bodies moved
through it, will pass without any Impediment from this Medium or Space,
yet since we see that Light passes the most solid Bodies also instantaneously, or
in a Velocity rapid beyond Imagination, here certainly it should meet with Im∣pediments
to stop it: For we find it pass through the hardest Body in the
World, namely, a Diamond; and seems to pass more freely through it than
through the Air or Water, or the most Fluid Body, as may be gathered from
the greater Refraction of the Rays from the perpendicular in the more solid
Body: Nor can I conceive how the Vacuity of the Pores of the Bodies can solve
this Difficulty, since it will be hard to conceive how those Pores can be alike
open every way to the Passages of the Atomes of Light.</P>
<P><HI>4thly,</HI> Supposing there such a Vacuity or Medium not resisting Motion, and
there were such Bodies as Atomes to be moved in it, yet 'tis difficult to con∣ceive
how they should receive so rapid a Motion from the Luminous Body:
<PB N="75" REF="109"/>
For no such rapid Motion is there in being. Now 'tis a Rule, <HI>Nil dat quad
non habet,</HI> that which hath no such rapid Motion cannot give it to the Atomes
that proceed from it. Now that 'tis not necessary a Luminous Body should
have so rapid a Motion, may be argued from the shining of a Diamond in the dark,
only by gently striking it with the end of ones Nail, as I have often
experimented, upon a large Diamond that had that Quality: Or from the shi∣ning
of rotten Wood, or such other cold Substances which seem not to have
any such kind of rapid Motion, and yet produce Light, which might be farther
instanced in the new <HI>Phosphori.</HI></P>
<P><HI>5thly,</HI> If such a rapid Motion of fiery Atomes should be the cause of Light;
it would be very difficult to conceive, how so tender a part as the Eye should
continually receive them concentrated in the <HI>Tunica Retina,</HI> and yet not be de∣stroyed
and batter'd in pieces by such continual Volleys of Atomes.</P>
<P><HI>6thly,</HI> If there were such a constant Emanation of Atomes, and that it has
continued ever since the Creation of Light: Certainly this supposed <HI>Inane,</HI> or
void Space between the Coelestial Bodies, must needs have been filled quite full
long before this, and then the free and istantaneous Motion of the succeeding
Emanations must have ceased, because they must find their way all stopt up
by others, and consequently by this time we should have had no Light at all
communicated from the Sun.</P>
<P>I could instance in many other Difficulties, as that of conveying the <HI>Species</HI>
of things, and the like; that this <HI>Hypothesis</HI> of the <HI>Epicureans</HI> or <HI>Atomists,</HI>
who did not understand the Reason of Vision is encumbred with, which seem
to make it impossible, and unfit for the Genuine Explication of their admirable
Proprieties of Light; but that these, I suppose, may suffice at present for this
purpose, though on the other side there are many things that may be said for it,
that have not been hitherto urged by any I have met with. Some of which
I shall have occasion hereafter to mention.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Aristotle</HI> was aware of these Difficulties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aristotle's Definition of Light.</NOTE> and therefore goes somewhat
more craftily to work in his Definition of Light: Giving you a Notion of it
in such general Terms without particular Explication, that you make almost
what you will of it, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Light is an Act
of a perspicuous Body, in as much as it is perspicuous. He affirms Colour to
be the Cause why a coloured Body is seen, and this Colour, says he, does
effectually move the Pellucid Body: But this Colour is not seen but with
Light, therefore says he, Colour in the Light does effectually move the Pel∣lucid
Body, but Colour without the Light, though it be congenit with the
Pellucid, yet it doth not actually move the Pellucid Body; therefore, says he,
the Body must be actually Pellucid that Colour may move it. Now it cannot
be <HI>actu</HI> Pellucid without Light, therefore Light is that which <HI>actu</HI> by its Action
makes a Pellucid Body: And therefore the Act of that pellucid Body is Light.
Now says he, this Light is not Fire nor any other Body, nor the <HI>Effluvium</HI> of
another Body, for so it would still be a Body; but 'tis the Presence of Fire, or
some such like, in the Pellucid, and the Absence or Privation of it Darkness:
From which his Definition of Light, I cannot I confess, well judge what his
Theory of Light was; for this Definition is only made upon one Effect of
Light, and doth not at all tell us under what <HI>Genus</HI> Light is put, nor what
are its Differences, nor what are the many Proprieties of it: So that these are
to be sought elsewhere. And when we have seen all he has said of Light, we
shall find our selves as much in the dark as before, as to the Knowledge of the
Nature of Light, he here considers Light only as it is in the <HI>Medium</HI> that con∣veys
it, namely, in a Pellucid or Transparent Body, and so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he Act of
the perspicuous Body; but what this Act is, or how it comes into the Pellucid
he tells not, that you must seek for elsewhere. However, though he has not
so particularly and positively explained what he means by this Expression of
his; nor did perhaps understand any plausible or intelligible <HI>Theory</HI> of it, yet
to me he seems to have light upon such an Expression as may possibly being
<PB N="76" REF="110"/>
Mechanically and Geometrically explained, more naturally and truly make out
the <HI>Theory</HI> of <HI>Light</HI> than any other Expression or Explanation of any other, ei∣ther
Ancient or Modern Naturalist, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Light is the
in-working of the Transparent Body or <HI>Medium;</HI> that is, the internal Action
of the Pellucid or Transparent Body, is that which is the Light of which we are
sensible, or that Light which moves the Eye; And this <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is nothing
but Motion, and this Motion is impressed by the Motion of the Lucid Body,
and that Body is Lucid that has such a Motion in it: So that Light in the shi∣ning
Body is a peculiar Motion of it, which can communicate it to the transpa∣rent
Medium, that is, to such a Body as is fit to propagate it, and Light in the
Eye is this Motion impressed on the Eye, by which the Brain or <HI>Anima</HI> becomes
sensible of it. For if we consider all the Appearances thereof, we shall at length
be necessitated to come to some such Conclusion: Nor can I conceive how the
Phoenomena thereof, can be by any other Hypothesis but this of a propagated
Motion, be comprehended. And though even this be not without its Difficul∣ties,
nor is it well conceivable how it should be, if we consider the almost in∣finite
Difference between the Propagations of Light, and the Motion of any
other sensible Body: Yet when we more attentively consider and weigh all the
Effects and Proprieties thereof, and compare them with the other Effects, and
Proprieties of more gross, tangible and sensible Bodies, we shall find that the <HI>Lex
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> is the very same, by which both the one and the other Motions are go∣verned;
and that there is here the same <HI>Regimen in Specie,</HI> though they differ
in Degrees.</P>
<P>5. The first and most difficult Propriety of this Motion of all the rest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Theory explained.</NOTE> is the
almost incomprehensible and unconceivable Extension thereof; which is as
boundless and unlimited as the Universe it self, or the <HI>Expansum</HI> of all Material
Beings: The Vastness of which is so great, that it exceeds the Comprehensions
of Man's Understanding. Insomuch that very many have asserted it absolutely
infinite, and without any Limits or Bounds, there being no bound set; but it
may be conceived, that Matter may still extend farther and farther continually,
being as infinite as Quantity, which is by all concluded to be so, both as to
its Greatness and Smallness: The Limits of which, cannot be either conceived
or expressed; for whatever can be conceived, may be expressed and computed
by Measure and Number. Now here no Number can be assigned, but there may
be given both a greater and a less: As Unity, let it signify never so great a
Quantity, as a Foot, a Yard, a Mile, a Diameter of the Earth or of its Orb,
may continually be increased by Multiplication or Addition, so as to represent
Tens, Hundreds, Thousands, Millions, and so onwards of its Quantity. So
be a Unity taken for never so small a Quantity, as a Foot, an Inch, a Line, an
Atome, its Quantity may be still suppos'd diminishable, either by Substraction
or Division; and so a Tenth, a Centesme, a Thousandth, a Millionth part of
it may be conceived and computed. Now the Propagation of this Motion is
coextent with it, as I shall afterwards prove.</P>
<P>To avoid the Incomprehensibleness therefore of this infinite Extension of the
Universe, and yet to make it as extensive as Quantity it self, <HI>Des Cartes</HI> has
found out a new Term or Expression for it, which he calls indefinite; which
Notion differs only from infinite in this, that the one has absolutely no Bounds
or End, and the other that it can have none assigned. But in truth, they have one
and the same Signification, and that is that Quantity neither hath any Bound,
nor can have any Bounds assigned to it by Humane Reason. And if Quantity can
have no Bounds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quantity boundless, or can have no Bounds set to it.</NOTE> then Body and Matter can have none, according to the aforesaid
Author <HI>Des Cartes</HI> Opinion, Body and Extension, or Quantity being the same
thing: So that wherever Extension can be supposed, there also must be sup∣posed
a Body, and where there is no Body there can be no Extension, and con∣sequently
no such thing as a Vacuum or Space devoid of Body.</P>
<P>But whether his Notion be true or not, 'tis not much to our present pur∣pose:
For most certain it is, whether it be finite or infinite, the Vastness of it
is so great that it exceeds our Imagination, to conceive of it truly as it is, and
whosoever has a finite and limited Conception of it, has a false one not ground∣ed
on Reason, but some precarious Opinion; for if we consider first the vast
<PB N="77" REF="111"/>
Distance between us and the Sun, which from the best and latest Observations
in Astronomy, is judged to be about 10000 Diameters of the Earth, each of
which is about 7925 <HI>English</HI> Miles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Distance of the Stars unconceivable.</NOTE> therefore the Sun's Distance is 79250000
Miles; and if we consider that according to the Observation, which I publish∣ed
to prove the Motion of the Earth, the whole Diameter of this Orb, <HI>viz.</HI>
20000 made the Subtense but of one Minute to one of the fixt Stars, which can∣not
therefore be less distant than 3438 Diameters of this great Orb, and conse∣quently
68760000 Diameters of the Earth: And if this Star be one of the near∣est,
and that the Stars that are of one Degree lesser in Magnitude, I mean not of
the second, because there may be many Degrees between the first and se∣cond,
be as much farther, and another sort yet smaller be three times as far, and
a fourth four times as far, and so onward; possibly to some Hundred De∣grees
of Magnitude, such as may really be discovered by longer and longer Te∣lescopes,
that they may be 100 times as far, then certainly this Material <HI>Ex∣pansum;</HI>
a part of which we are, must be so great that 'twill infinitely exceed
our shallow Conception to imagine. Now by what I last mentioned, it is evi∣dent,
that Light extends it self to the utmost imaginable Parts; and by the help
of Telescopes, we collect the Rays, and make them sensible to the Eye, which
are emitted from some of the almost inconceivably remote Objects: And since
we find, that still longer and better Telescopes do discover to us
smaller and smaller fixt Stars, which in Probability are farther and farther removed from
us, and that we cannot set Bounds to the Extent of it; it follows, I say, that
the Extension of the Propagation of Light is indefinite, immense, and beyond
our reach to conceive, yet nevertheless we see by clear Induction that so it
must be, though we do not presently well conceive how. Nor is it only the
great Body of the Sun, or the vast Bodies of the fixed Stars, that are thus able
to disperse their Light through the vast <HI>Expansum</HI> of the Universe: But the
smallest Spark of a Lucid Body must do the very same thing, even the smallest
Globule, struck from a Steel by a Flint, which is as small as the Point of a
Pin. For that produces as real Light as the other; and all Light propagating
<HI>in Orbem,</HI> that Point must do the same thing with every Point of the Superfi∣cies
of the Sun. Now that every Point of the Luminous Superficies does emit
Light <HI>in Orbem</HI> through the Diaphanous Medium, is evident from this, that
there is no Point of the Ambient Transparent Medium in which the Eye be∣ing
placed, does not see every Point of the Lucid Surface, and consequently
every sensible Point of the Superficies of the shining Body, does really propa∣gate
its Light thus <HI>in Orbem.</HI> Nor is this to be limited to a Point big enough
to be sensible to the naked Eye; for by the Help of Microscopes viewing a
Lucid and shining Body, as a burning Cole, or a red hot Iron, or the like;
one is able to distinguish Parts that shine 1000 smaller than we can distinguish
with the naked Eye, and yet these may be discover'd and are visible, and con∣sequently
must radiate <HI>in Orbem,</HI> as the bigger and more sensible Parts: So
that hereby we are ascertained by our Sense, that the least sensible Point of
Body is able to affect the greatest <HI>Expansum</HI> of Nature. So it appears both to
our Sense and our Reason, and therefore we cannot doubt it, but set it down
as an undoubted Principle.</P>
<P>6. But then secondly, In the next place, this Propagation of Light which is
immense, is (in all Probability, and as far as Experiments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Motion of Light infinite∣ly swift.</NOTE>
Observations and
Reasons can assist us) infinitely swift: Or we may say, that the Propagation
thereof through the whole vast or immense <HI>Expansum,</HI> as far as we can yet
find, is made in a Point or Instant of time; and at the very Instant that the re∣motest
Star does emit Light, in that very Instant does the Eye upon the Earth
receive it, though it be many Millions of Millions of Miles distant, so that in
Probability no time is spent between the emitting and the Reception; for with
this agrees all the Experiments that have been thought of for this purpose, and
no one has yet proved it temporary, though many ways have been thought of
for that purpose: And though the ingenious Monsieur <HI>Romer</HI> pretends to have
found a way,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Romer</HI>'s Ex∣periment doub∣ted whether sufficient.</NOTE> by which he hath experimentally proved, that this Propagation
is not instantaneous but temporary, and so there is somewhat of time spent in
the Passage of Light, from the illuminating Object to the Eye or Body en∣lightned,
<PB N="78" REF="112"/>
yet if we examine his Experiment a little more considerately we may
find reason to doubt, whether he hath from these grounds sufficient to make
such a Conclusion. Certain it is, whether by it he proves the matter he aims
at, or not: His Ingenuity in the inventing the way was not less to be esteemed
and valued, than if it had succeeded; nay, it is altogether as valuable, if by
it we could prove that no space of time were spent whilst the Light is propagated
such a determinate Space, as if it proved it to be momentary and measurable.
For in all Inquiries of this Nature Truth is the thing sought after, and
the finding of that is the Reward of our Endeavours: And therefore I would
not be thought to examine this Observation of this ingenious Man, with any
design to detract any thing from the Credit of the Observation, or the deserved
Reputation of the Author. But that I may first explain it to such perhaps as
have not heard of it; Secondly, that I may put some in mind of it, that per∣haps
may have forgot it; and Thirdly, That I may excite both, or either, to
be mindful to make some farther Observations of their own of that kind, to
see if by any means they can thereby determine this Question, whether the Propagation
of Light for such a determinate Distance, or Length, be instantaneous
or temporary: For till that be proved positively, the true Theory cannot be
proved, as we shall afterwards shew. His Way then which is printed in the
Journal <HI>des Scavans</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> and since in <HI>English</HI> in the 136<HI>th</HI> Philosophical
Transaction, is by the Light of the Sun reflected from the Satellit of ♃, both
when it enters and when it emergies out of the Shadow of the Body of ♃, by
which he endeavours to demonstrate, that the time that Light spends in passing
about 3000 <HI>French</HI> Leagues, or 7925 19/83 <HI>English</HI> Miles, of 5280 <HI>English</HI> Feet to
a Mile, that is, in passing a whole Diameter of the Globe of the Earth, is less
than one single second, or the 60th part of a Minute of an Hour.</P>
<P>But to consider a little further this ingenious Way of Monsieur <HI>Romer,</HI> I do
very much doubt, that we are as much to seek for a true Theory of this Satel∣lit
of ♃, as we are of our own Satellit the Moon, if not somewhat more, by
reason that the Anomaly thereof may be complicated with more different Mo∣tions
than even this of the Moon, which is affected only by two Bodies, <HI>viz.</HI>
the Sun and the Earth; whereas I am of Opinion, that the Motion of this in∣most
Satellit may be acted on also by the other three exteriour Satellits, and
consequently there will need other Equations and Allowances to be made in the
Calculation of its true Place, besides the Allowances for the Influences of the
Sun, and the Body of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> which whether he did conceive or take any
Cognizance of, I know not: And therefore unless we are assured of the true
intermediate times between the Eclipses of it, we cannot make a certain Con∣clusion.</P>
<P>But supposing this may prove it to be temporary, and not instantaneous, yet
we find that 'tis so exceeding swift that 'tis beyond Imagination; for so far he
thinks indubitable, that it moves a Space equal to the Diameter of the Earth,
or near 8000 Miles, in less than one single Second of the time, which is in as
short time as one can well pronounce 1, 2, 3, 4: And if so, why it may not be
as well instantaneous I know no reason, unless it may be said 'tis inconceivable
any Body can be infinitely fluid; which yet how it can be denied, I know not,
unless we will allow a Vacuity, which the great Asserter of the Instantaneous
Propagation of Light, Monsieur <HI>Descartes</HI> will by no means admit. Now that
either there must be a Vacuity, or an infinite Fluid, or else no Motion can be
made, every way, will necessarily follow from Geometrical Demonstrations of
the Proprieties of Figure: And therefore either infinite Fluidity must be allowed
in Matter, or a Vacuity. Nor can this infinite Fluidity be evaded, by saying,
that there is a Matter indefinitely fluid, because if indefinitely signifies any
thing less than infinite, the Demonstrations holds good against it, as well as if
it signify'd finite. There is a necessity therefore of admitting in Nature, either
first a Vacuity, which impugns the very ground of the <HI>Cartesian</HI> Principles, <HI>viz.</HI>
that Body and Extension are the same thing; or secondly, a Penetration of Di∣mensions,
which is likewise contradictory both to his and the Opinion of most
eminent Philosophers in the World; or thirdly, a perfect <HI>Plenum</HI> but infinitely fluid, which I conceive cannot be disproved. But being proved, I shall after∣wards
<PB N="79" REF="113"/>
shew all the strange and unconceivable Phenomena or Light will be most
clearly and evidently, and most demonstrably made out; and nor only the rea∣son
shown why its Extension is so vast, but why its Propagation is so instanta∣neous.
Now though I cannot now stand to shew the Reasons of these Con∣clusions,
yet by a Methodical and clear Process of Demonstration they will be
shewn to be as necessary Consequences from undeniable Principles, as any Con∣clusion
made by <HI>Euclid</HI> in his Geometry, of which I shall have occasion to speak
more largely.</P>
<P>This being that we call Light, sure if any thing may be call'd the <HI>Anima
Mundi:</HI> Its Action being so near of Kin to that of a Spirit, the whole Mass be∣ing
in an instant acted by it, and made sensible as I may so speak, of what is
done in any one Point: So that Light may be said to be <HI>tota in toto &amp; tota in
qualibet parte,</HI> possibly with some kind of Plausibleness. And yet after all this
we may prove it to be purely corporeal, and subjected to the same Laws that
bulky, tangible, and gross Bodies are subject to. This may inform us also,
how even the very remotest Star, and every one of those indefinite Number of
Stars may have an Influence every Moment upon this Ball of the Earth on
which we tread, and every one upon every other, and all in Proportion Measure
and Harmony, so they were made, and so they are preserved, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>7. We come then in the third place to note, that this Propagation of Light,
whether it be instantaneous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Propagation of Light the A∣ction of a Body.</NOTE> as most probably it is, or temporaneous, and re∣quires
a time someway proportion'd to its Distance, is not the Action of a Spi∣rit
but of a Body, and that it is subjected to the same Laws that other corpo∣real
Actions or Motions are subjected to, and consequently is a Subject that
falls under the Laws of Quantity, and there its Proprieties may be a fit Subject
for Geometrical Exercitation.</P>
<P>And this appears first, for that its Power or Action is always proportionable
to its Expansion; now this Expansion in a free Pellucid Medium, is in a Du∣plicate
Proportion to the Distance it acts reciprocally taken.</P>
<P>The Actions of Light are first, that effect it causes in the Eye, where it cre∣ates
a Passion which makes us sensible of Light, which Effect or Action of Light
is sometimes so very small and curious, that we should no way have been sen∣sible
of it had not the Creator given us an Organ Passive by it, and so fit to
discover it, and had Mankind not had that Organ of Sight, no other part of
our Body could have been sensible of that Effect, nor could it ever have entred
into our Imagination to conceive what way it were possible the Mind or Under∣standing
of Man should be informed of an Action a thousand thousand Miles off,
at the same Instant that it was there done, nor though it were a shorter way that this
Information came, <HI>viz.</HI> 8000 Miles which Monsieur <HI>Romer</HI> says he
has proved, is passed in less than a second of time: We could have had, I say,
no Imagination concerning it, nor any Conception of the Possibility of the Ap∣pearance
of Light or Colours. Hence, To hint this only by the by, we cannot
conclude but that possibly there may be many other Motions and Operations of
Bodies at a distance, and several other ways by which the Bodies of the World
may influence one another, though it has pleas'd God not to give us Organs or
Senses to discover them, and thereby many things that are accounted Sympa∣thetick
or Magical may be done by Natural Causes and Powers, of which we
have no Organs to make us sensible. Now from divers late Discoveries about
the influencing Powers of Gravity and Magnetism, to name no other at present,
of which we have no Sense that does immediately inform us; but we become
knowing and assur'd of them by other means, than immediately by peculiar Or∣gans
of Sense.</P>
<P>Now this Propagation of Light doth act duplicately proportionate to the
Distance from the Lucid reciprocally;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Propaga∣tion acts in a Duplicate Pro∣portion to the distance.</NOTE> that is, the Strength of the Light at one
Foot distance from the Lucid Body, is to the Strength of the Light at two
Foot as four to one, and to that at three as nine to one, and so forwards. So
that the farther this Action is propagated, the more is it expanded, rarify'd, or
weakned. To explain this, Let us conceive all the Medium incompassing the
Lucid Body within the Compass of a Sphere of a Foot <HI>Radius,</HI> to be by the
<PB N="80" REF="114"/>
Power of Light in the Lucid Point, thrown out and opened into a hollow Orb,
which shall incompass this emptied Globe of a Foot Diameter, possessed by the
shining Body. The Thickness then of this incompassing Orb will be √c 2—√c
1. the Expansion of this Orb causes the fluid Matter that was in its place
before to expand into a bigger Orb: The Thickness of which will be √c 3—√c 2.
and so onward. So that the Rarefaction or weakening of the Power of Light
increases in Duplicate Proportion to the Distance, and that this is so does plain∣ly
appear by Multitudes of Experiments, which I shall have occasion to make
use of hereafter.</P>
<P>Next, Though so small a Degree of this Power or Action as does affect the
Eye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Action of light carries with it a cer∣tain degree of Heat.</NOTE> doth not move or affect the other Senses of our Body, yet is it not with∣out
its effect upon other Bodies, besides that which it works on the acutely
sensible Parts of the <HI>Retina</HI> of the Eye; for we find, that it also doth produce
Heat, and every the least degree of it carries along with it some, though it be
a small degree of Heat: Which degrees, if they are collected and concentred,
do produce very sensible Effects both upon the touch, and also upon most other
Bodies, whether fluid or solid: For we find it to rarify Fluids, and to melt, burn,
and shatter to pieces the most solid Bodies: And therefore though the rarify'd,
and smallest Degree of Light does not actually produce sensible Effects, yet
since the Constipation, Multiplication, or collecting of many of those together.
It follows, that the least Degree of Light has somewhat of Heat; and that the
reason why it is not sensible, is only because of its Smalness, and that it is be∣neath
those Degrees which are before actually in the Ambient, even as in the
Day-time we are insensible of the Stars, because the Light of the Sun hath al∣ready
fill'd the Air with a greater Light: Not that they do then less shine up∣on
us than they do in the Night, for as I many Years since here shewed many
of them may be seen at Noon-day, by the help of Telescopes. And (as I shall
afterwards prove more at large) there is no degree of Light, but has its de∣gree
of Heat proportion'd to those degrees of Light, which are concomitant to
the degrees of the Light of the Sun. To this many have objected, that the
Light of the Moon is so far from being actually hot, that it is actually
cold, and the more those Rays are condensed the more is the Cold augmented:
And to this purpose <HI>Wepferus,</HI> in his Treatise <HI>De Apoplexia,</HI> relates a Story
how by the collecting the Rays of the Moon there was produced an actual
Cold, which was very sensible to the hand held in the <HI>Focus.</HI> But this he re∣lates
not as tried by himself, but by another Person; but upon Inquiry further
concerning this Matter, I cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind there was any such Matter certainly ob∣served.
So that the Observation is suspected to have proceeded from some Mi∣stake,
and the Person said to have made this Observation, would not maintain
any such Assertion, and therefore though it might well suit with the Relator's
Theory, yet till we have some more positive Proof of Matter of Fact, and of the Curiosity and Circumstances of the Observation, I hope we may be dis∣pensed
with, though we are not of his Opinion.</P>
<P>Besides, I have this to answer, That by divers Experiments purposely made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the Rays of the Moon have no sensible Heat.</NOTE>
both by my self and divers others, we could not find that the Rays of Light
from the Moon had any such Power of Cold as is pretended; nor indeed could
we find, that they had any sensible degree of Heat, for having made the Tryals
with reflecting Concaves, which collected a great Quantity of the Rays, and
concentred them upon a Thermoscrope (which would be moved sensibly by a
very little Alteration of Heat or Cold) I could not certainly perceive any sen∣sible
Variation, though the little accidental Changes of Heat or Cold in the
Ambient Air, were very sensible by it; so that whatsoever may be pretended,
I am sufficiently assured there is no such cooling Quality in the Light of the Moon.</P>
<P>Now that the degree of Heat, if proportion'd to the degree of Light, as in
the Sun must be very small, and consequently wholly insensible to us will
plainly appear, if we consider what Rarefaction of Light is caused by the Re∣flection
from the Body of the Moon. And how small a Quantity of the Light
of the Sun, which falls upon the Moon is reflected to us: For if we consider,
that when the Moon is full, and so all the Hemisphere of it visible to us, is
inlightned by the Sun, that the Quantity of Light which falls upon that He∣misphere
<PB N="81" REF="115"/>
of the Moon is rarified into a Sphere about 228 times bigger in Dia∣meter
than the Moon before it arrive to us, and consequently that the Light of
the Moon is 104368 times weaker than the Light of the Sun; and consequent∣ly,
that there must be 104268 full Moons to reflect a Light as strong upon
the Earth at Midnight as the Sun doth at Noon day: And therefore 'tis no
great Wonder, if a 104368th part of the Heat of the Suns Rays is not felt by
us. This would be the greatest Strength of the Moon's Rays, supposing no
part of the Sun's Light were lost in the Body of the Moon, but that all were
reflected; but then if a part of it be there lost, it will make the Disproportion
considerable greater, and consequently less sensible: Though therefore we are
not sensible of the Heat of that Light, yet we are not to conclude it without its
due Proportion of Heat.</P>
<P>The same Reason may be valid, why the Light of Gloworms, rotten Wood,
Fish, and the Late invented <HI>Phosphorus,</HI> do not at all affect the touch with
their Warmth: For though that degree of Heat be proportion'd to their degree
of Light, yet their Proportion of Light is so small, that 'tis not to be imagin'd
it should produce any degree equivalent to that which is in the Air that incom∣passes our Body.</P>
<P>8. This Instantaneous Propagation of Light is in the next place in straight
Lines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Propaga∣tion of Light in strait Lines in an homoge∣neous Medium.</NOTE> every way from the Radiating Lucid Point, through a uniform pellucid
Medium. With this agrees the Judgment and Consent of all, both Ancient and
Modern Authors, that have written of this Subject, all conclude it to radiate
every way in straight Lines from the Luminous Point, whether they supposed it
a Flame, as divers of the Ancients; or whether they supposed it a Flux of A∣tomes,
as the <HI>Epicureans,</HI> or Species, as the <HI>Peripateticks,</HI> or the Motion of a
stagnant Body, as the <HI>Cartesians,</HI> and our Country-man Mr. <HI>Hobbs;</HI> they all
supposed it to pass in straight Lines, though some of them supposed those Lines
to be but Physically such, that is, so that the whole made a straight Line,
though the imperceptible parts thereof might be a little bended by the Position
of the Pores, as the Atomists suppos'd, or by the Form of the constituent Parts
of the pellucid <HI>Medium;</HI> as the <HI>Cartesians,</HI> who imagined the said <HI>Medium</HI> to
consist of small Globules contiguous to each other. And with this also agree
all Observations both in the Heavens, and on the Earth, nor have any Experi∣ments
or Observations hitherto contradicted it. Now though the Propagation
of Light at a great Distance should be temporaneous, and so be some conside∣rable
time in coming from the Luminous Body to the Eye, and thence that the
Morning Object should not be in the same place that it appears to the Eye, yet
this hinders not but that; that temporaneous Propagation may still be made in
a straight Line, there being no Cause assignable in a uniform stagnant Medium
why it should be otherwise.</P>
<P>But then this hinders not, but that this straight Line may be bent by a Difform Medium.</P>
<P>In the next place therefore, the Propagation of Light is various ways affect∣ed,
and so the Straightness of the Rays is changed and diverted another way.</P>
<P>1<HI>st.</HI> By a Medium not uniform and homogeneous, the Ray is bent from a
straight Line into a Curv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By a Difform Medium the Ray is bent in∣to a Curve.</NOTE> which I have long since proved by many Observa∣tions
and Experiments, and published in the Year 1664. This Passion of Light
from a difform <HI>Medium,</HI> I have called <HI>Inflection;</HI> and shall hereafter have oc∣casion
more fully to treat of it.</P>
<P>2<HI>ly,</HI> The Straightness of the way of Propagation is broken, short as it were,
and diverted another way by its passing out of one uniform Medium into ano∣ther
uniform <HI>Medium.</HI> This is call'd <HI>Refraction</HI> of the Ray, whereby the
straight Line of Propagation is at the Superficies of the two contiguous transpa∣rent
<HI>Mediums</HI> diverted some other way within the second <HI>Medium,</HI> which
makes an Angle at the Superficies w the former Rays contiuued.</P>
<P>3<HI>ly,</HI> The Ray is broken and diverted another way by its meeting with a <HI>Me∣dium</HI>
unfit for admitting the Propagation of Light through it self, and thereby
the Ray is kept within the first Medium, but at the <HI>Superficies</HI> is with an An∣gle
diverted and bent short another way, this is called Reflection.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="116"/>
4<HI>ly,</HI> The Ray is impeded, stopp'd, deaded, or absorpt by meeting with a
Body unfit either to propagate it through it self, or reflect it into the first <HI>Me∣dium,</HI>
which may be called Mortification or Extinction, of this kind are blank
Bodies, and divers others which retain and keep it for a long time, and do not
whilst they keep that Form, return or communicate it to any other.</P>
<P>5<HI>ly,</HI> The Ray is dispersed, split, and opened by its Refraction at the Super∣ficies
of a second Medium, and from a Line is opened into a diverging Super∣ficies,
and so obliquated, whereby the Appearances of Colours are pro∣duced.</P>
<P>6<HI>ly,</HI> The Rays of Light are imbib'd into, and receiv'd by a second Medium,
and thence returned again by degrees after they have remain'd a considerable
time in the recipient Medium, as in the <HI>Bononia</HI> Stone, and some of our late
invented <HI>Phosphori.</HI></P>
<P>Of each of these, I shall more at large discourse, and explain the particu∣lar
Causes and Reasons of these Affections, and the Rules, Laws, and Limits of their several Powers.</P>

<Q>1. The true Method of acquiring Knowledge, is first by examining the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
that it is so, and then the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> why it is so. 2. The Bodies from
whence Light proceeds, as first the Sun; its vast Bigness and Distance
from the Earth, emits Rays every way equally in Orbem, is subject to
Changes from its. Spots which are at large described; with their Mo∣tions
and Nature, and of the Sun's Rotation. 3. That the Rays of the
Sun carry Heat as well as Light, that the Sun has Heat really, and
that it is not produced by the Reflexion of the Rays from the Earth;
why the upper Air colder. 4. That the Sun is incompassed with an At∣mosphere,
or something analogous to it, the Limb which appears to us
is that of the Atmosphere, more of the Spots: The Sun agrees with the
Earth in most Particulars except Light, why the Light of the Sun is
most insisted on. 5. Farther Reasons that there must be a fluid Body
incompassing the Sun, with a farther Explication of the Spots, that they
are not Planets like the Body of Venus or Mercury in Sole, tho' there
may possibly be Planets nearer the Sun than them which the Author sees
no reason to believe, these Spots are within the Atmosphere of the Sun,
and much of the Nature of Meteors, a farther Confirmation that there
is a small transparent Shell or Atmosphere about the Sun. 6. That
within this Shell is a solid Opaque Body, solid from its Rotation, Fix∣edness
of its Axis, and its Power of Gravitation, Opaque from the
Spots not appearing thro' it. 7. Eight Particulars, wherein the Sun
and Earth agree, and three wherein they differ. 8. Supposing the Sun
composed of Nitrous and Sulphureous Particles, and set on Fire, all the
Phenomena thereof may be explained, the Proportion of the Diminution
of the Action of Light in Proportion to the Distance from the Lumincus
Body demonstrated, and that the Light of the Sun is from an actual
Fire, or Dissolution of the Superficial Parts thereof, with an Objection

great Man has done, or at least would be thought so to have done; begins at
the wrong end, and at length when he came to the ultimate and most visible
Effects, he found himself, or at least most Men have found it for him, that
he was much at a loss and unable to get out, and extricate himself.</P>
<P>The Works of Nature are a great Labyrinth, which is already built and per∣fected,
their ways are determined and bounded by impenetrable Walls; and
there are no new Passages to be made, other than what are already fixt: He
therefore that shall think immediately to fly and transport himself over these
Walls, and set himself in the very middle and inmost Recess of it, and thence
think himself able to know all the Meanders and Turnings, and Passages back
again to get out; will find himself hugely mistaken and puzled in finding his
way out again.</P>
<P>Whereas he, that would march secure, must first find some open and visible
Entry, and there enter with his Clew and his Instruments, and take notice of
what Turnings and Passages he finds, and see how far he can proceed in this
and that way, before he finds a <HI>ne plus ultra;</HI> then setting down and protract∣ing
all the ways he has there gone, and what he has there met withal, he must
return by the help of his Clew and try another Passage, and do as much there,
and so a third and a fourth, and so onward, setting down still and protracting
his several Essays; by comparing of all which together, he will at last be able
to give you the true Ground plat of the whole Labyrinth, and thereby to tell
you which is the right and which is the wrong way to find the middle or Cen∣ter:
Which is the nearest and which is the farthest way about, which is the
plainest and easiest, and which the ruggedest and the most difficultest, which
the lightest, and which the darkest Passage, and all the Occurences you will
meet withal in the ways.</P>
<P>The most of our Philosophers that have hitherto written, have gone the o∣ther
way to work. They have begun from some inward part of the Labyrinth,
having made some small Entrance, and have thence thought they knew the
whole Fabrick, and to have found the way out again by the help of their Me∣mories,
neglecting or despising the Clew, the Compass, the Circumferenter,
and the Chain, whereby to observe Measure, and set down all they observed in
their way: And have thereupon feigned a way, and have made to themselves
a Labyrinth, and have presently given you a Design of the whole. But alas;
this Labyrinth was in their own Mind, and not of Nature's making, and how
perfect soever they are in their own Method, they are altogether to seek in
that of Nature.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Pythagoreans</HI> were puzled with their Numbers; the <HI>Peripateticks</HI>
with their Four Elements; the <HI>Epicureans</HI> with their Atoms; the <HI>Chymists</HI> with
their three Principles, Salt, Sulphur, Mercury; <HI>Ptolomy</HI> with his Orbs and
Epicycles; <HI>Kepler</HI> with his Harmonicks; <HI>Guilbert</HI> with his Magnetisms; not
to name many of the Ancients, some whereof would reduce all from Fire, o∣thers
from Air, and others from Water, some from Heat and Cold, others from
Light and Darkness, others from Good and Evil, but all fell short of the true
Explication of Nature.</P>
<P>He therefore that would make <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thorough Discovery, must begin from the
most sensible, obvious and plain Effects of Nature; of these he must make a
diligent Inquiry, first what is done, and then as near as may be how 'tis
done.</P>
<P>Our present Inquiry therefore being after the Nature of Light: To proceed ac∣cording
to the Method I have now been speaking of to you, we must first inquire
and search on the outside of this Labyrinth, and see what Entrances or Inlets
there are by which we penetrate into it; that is, we must inquire what are
the most obvious and sensible Effects of it: These must be all, if possible, found
out, enumerated, and set down. Secondly, Every one of these again must be
more strictly examined, determined, and stated, and the Limits set, its <HI>Maxi∣mum</HI>
and <HI>Minimum</HI> demonstrated; its comparative Likeness and Unlikeness to
the Proprieties of other Subjects taken notice of, and recorded; its Congru∣ents
or Opponents, or its Promoters or Retarders; its Contraries and Destroy∣ers;
and the like must also be examined, and all these must be Methodically
Disposed and Registred into fit Tables, that so out of these sound Materials
<PB N="85" REF="119"/>
chosen with Judgment, examined with Strictness, cleansed and fitted with
great Sedulity and Reasonings, we may raise a sound and lasting Structure
that no Age or right Reason shall overthrow or destroy.</P>
<P>Such are the Fabricks raised by Geometry, thus <HI>Euclid</HI>'s and <HI>Archimede</HI>'s De∣monstrations,
none since have been able to disprove. This Learning which was
said to have been brought first out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> was possibly known before the Py∣ramids
were built, and may last when not a Dust of those massy Piles may be
left undevoured by Time; for Truth always was, is, and ever will be the
same.</P>
<P>2. To find the Nature of Light we must examine first, what it is in the Lu∣minous
Body that is the Fountain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bodies from whence Light proceeds.</NOTE> and emits or causes it; Secondly, what it is
in the Medium that propagates and conveys it; and Thirdly, what it is in the
Eye, or the subject that receives it, and is affected or acted by it.</P>
<P>The first thing then I shall take notice of, is of the Bodies from which Light
proceeds, as from the Fountains; whence it has its Original and first Spring▪
Namely, of such as we have no sense that informs us, that 'tis brought into
them from any other place, but seems to be there generated and produced.</P>
<P>These Bodies are very many, and very differing in their Constitutions,
and therefore the Enumeration of them, and some of their Proprieties may be a great
help to us to judge of the Nature of Light.</P>
<P>The greatest and most remarkable of all (at least <HI>quoad nos</HI>) is the most glo∣rious
Body of the Sun; which from the glorious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The vast Big∣ness of the Sun and Distance from the Earth.</NOTE> great, and powerful Effects
of it upon this World or Earth, on which Mankind is placed, was by the Hea∣thens,
<HI>Romans, Greeks, Persians,</HI> &amp;c. esteemed a God, and so worshipped
and adored; but under various Names, as <HI>Jupiter, Apollo, Phaebus, Phaeton,</HI>
and several other Names, all of which signified the Sun. As <HI>Juno, Venus, Cyn∣thia,
Diana,</HI> &amp;c. signified the Moon. The things observable in this Body, be∣sides
its Light, are first, that 'tis the greatest Body we yet know in the World,
of whose Magnitude we can have any tolerable Certainty: It being very much
bigger than all the Planets together, <HI>viz.</HI> ♄, ♃, ♂, the Earth, ♀, ☿, and their
Satellits, <HI>viz.</HI> those of ♄, ♃, and the Earth, and may be possibly bigger than
any fixt Star, of which by and by.</P>
<P>The Bigness of it is collected from its Distance, and the Angle, under
which it is seen. The Distance is by some of our late Astronomers, who have
been more than ordinarily curious in their Observations, judged to be about
10000 Diameters of the Earth distant from us, and the Angle under which it
is seen about half a Degree: Its Diameter therefore must be about 1/114 part of
its Distance, and consequently about 87 times bigger than the Diameter of the
Earth, its Body therefore being Spherical, as I shall shew by and by, must be
87 times 87 times 87, that is, 658503 times bigger in Bulk than the Body or
Globe of the Earth: And therefore the Surface of it, which is the part that
gives Light, is 7569 greater than the whole Superficies of the Globe of the
Earth. Now almost half this Superficies is seen at once, and therefore that
part is near 3784½ times bigger than the whole Superficies of the Earth. Now
every part of the whole Superficies of the Sun does shine, and emit Light every
way <HI>in Orbem,</HI> which will be probable from this, that a very large Zone of
the Sun doth so; and therefore since all parts of the Sun seem to give Light
alike, it is more than probable, that every other part of the Sun's Surface doth
the same thing. Now before I demonstrate this, I must note to you another
Propriety observed in the Body of the Sun, which is necessary for proving both
the real Bnlk of its Body, and the radiating every way of the Superficial parts
of it. It is observed then, that there sometimes happen to be several dark and
dusky Spots visible upon its Surface, whose Passage over the Sun have been by
Telescopes and other Instruments curiously traced and calculated, by which it
plainly appears, 1st, That this Body we see, which appears only as a Plain, is
a Globous and Spherical Body; and this because the said Spots are observed to
pass over its Face with a Motion proportion to a double Line of Sines, or as
they must appear, supposing they were placed upon a Globe appearing under
that Angle, and equally turning round upon an <HI>Axis.</HI> This is yet further con∣firmed
by the Alteration of the Shape of the Spots, when they are nearer the
<PB N="86" REF="120"/>
Limb, and so are posited obliquely from what they appeared in the middle,
and so directly faceing us; which Alteration perfectly answers to the Shape
of such a Spot, made upon the Face of a Globe, and by turning the Globe,
altering the Position of it to the Eye. These tell us further, that this vast
Globe makes a Revolution in 25 Days, or thereabouts, upon an Axis obliquely
posited to the Ecliptick; whence it is plain, as I noted before, that all parts of
the Sun's Surface do shine, for that they are sometime or other seen. 2dly,
There being no part of the Sun's Surface lying hetween the two Tropicks of
the Earth upon it, but is sometime or other seen in all the Positions of a Hemi∣sphere,
and yet continually seeming as far as we can discover, equally giving
Light; it follows, that all those parts at least do emit Rays of Light <HI>in Orbem</HI>
the like may with all manner of Probability, be concluded of all the rest.</P>
<P>The next thing then I shall observe is, that this great Body is subject to as
great Changes in its superficial parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sun subject to Changes and of the Spots seen in it.</NOTE> as any that happen to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uperficial
parts of the Earth, and consequently may have Generations and Corruptions,
or Alterations, as do happen here upon the Earth. This is eviden<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> by those
great Spots which, as I have noted to you, do often appear upon the Face of the
Sun, and move along with it.</P>
<P>These are of no certain Figure, nor of any certain Bigness, but sometimes
bigger, sometimes less, sometimes more appear, sometimes fewer: sometimes
darker, sometimes dusky, sometimes brighter. Most of the dark have about
them a Duskiness at a certain Distance, which does sometimes remain after the
dark one be quite wasted, as they are found sometimes before the dark appear.
Some of these Spots have been observed to turn into Spots brighter than the rest
of the Sun's Surface, but especially when they approach the Limb of the Sun,
where also many of the dusky ones appear, and more than usually upon the
middle parts of the Sun. Both the dusky, and especially the brighter parts,
are observed to stay some of them considerably longer in the Limb of the Sun
than they ought to do, according to the Theory of moving upon and along with
the <HI>Superficies</HI> of the Globe: But they are never seen to appear without the
Limb, but within the edge or in the very edge of the Sun, without making any
Protuberance. The brighter Spots are observed to appear brighter towards the
Limb, and sometimes to appear in it very bright.</P>
<P>They are observed always to pass over the Face of the Sun, from the East∣side
towards the West, sometimes in a straight Line, and sometimes in an Ellip∣sis
when they move regularly, but they are also sometimes observed to decline
out of those Lines, and swerve sometimes towards the North, and sometimes
towards the South, but never to go the contrary way.</P>
<P>Sometimes one of these Spots divides into many, which separeate from one
another, and sometimes many of them coaless, and joyn together in one.</P>
<P>From all which Appearances, it is very evident, First, That these Spots are
Bodies moved upon, or in some fluid Body somewhat of the Nature of those
we have upon the Earth, as to Fluidity, <HI>viz.</HI> Air or Water, though possibly
the fluid, may differ from these Earthly Bodies in other Qualities.</P>
<P>Secondly, That these Bodies are either opaque, and so hinder the Light of
the Sun to pass through them, or else they are incombustible and dark Bodies,
which will afford no Light at all for a certain time, and do as it were quench
and deaden that part of the Sun where they rise.</P>
<P>So that though the Face of the Sun be the most glorious and vivid Light
that we are sensible of in the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Account of the Spots in the Sun.</NOTE> yet since the Discovery and Use of Per∣spective
Glasses it has been observed, not to be free from some parts that are
dusky, and some perfectly dark, and some other parts that are observed to give
a brighter Light than even the clear Face of the Sun it self: The former are
called <HI>Nebulae</HI> or Clouds, the second <HI>Maculae</HI> or Spots, and the third <HI>Faculae</HI> or
Blazes. These have been observed by <HI>Schiner, Galileo,</HI> and others, to be gene∣rated
up and down in various parts of the Sun's Face, and to increase and grow
bigger sometimes, and sometimes to grow less, decay and vanish: Their In∣crease
is sometimes from a small Cloudiness, to increase larger and larger, and
then in the middle sometimes, and sometimes in various parts of it, to have perfect dark Spots, which also continue to increase sometimes so big as to co∣ver
<PB N="87" REF="121"/>
a part of the Sun equal to all <HI>Europe,</HI> and sometimes to be bigger than all
the Superficies of the Earth, those Spots do sometimes coaless and joyn all in∣to
one, and sometimes divide and separate into divers, and part asunder consi∣derably:
And again, at other times many of those Spots which are generated
separately, do meet together and make one great one. These appear sometimes
of a dusky Red, sometimes Yellowish, sometimes of a dusky Blew, and vari∣ous
other Colours; their Shape is very irregular, and scarce any two alike, not
unlike the upper sides or edges of the great white Clouds we usually see here
in the Summer-time: Yet generally the edges of the <HI>Maculae</HI> or darkest Spots,
are very desined, and this Spot is perfectly Black to the very edges; but always
about these edges to a certain Distance, which is much the same, be the Spot
bigger or less there is a dusky bordering, which is likewise shaped according
to the edges of the Spot, and is all of an even Darkness or Duskiness. The
<HI>Faculae</HI> are not defined but uneven, and usually appear brightest towards the
middle. The Shape of these Spots sometimes continue much the same for some
Days, but yet seldom without some Alteration: So that indeed they seem to
be always in a State of Alteration, but sometimes quicker sometimes slower.
From the Observation of them in several parts of the Sun, it is most demon∣strably
evident, that they have some kind of Thickness, but very small in com∣parison
to their Breadth; for as they approach towards the Limb, they keep
their extent toward the North and South, but diminish towards the East
and West, in the same manner as a broad flat Body would do if variously po∣sited
to the Eye: Insomuch as such as are towards a round appear by degrees
to turn to a longer Oval, almost all in the edge appear a Line bended circular∣ly,
which is an evident Proof that the Motion of them is on a Spherial Surface,
and not a plain, for if it were on a plain the Shape of them would receive no
other Alteration at the Limb of the Sun than it would at the middle. And
from hence also we have a good Argument, that the Body of the Sun is a Globe,
and not a plain flat round Superficies, as some of the ancient Philosophers are
said to have asserted it; nor a round Hole bored through the dark Shell of the
Universe, to let through the Light of the <HI>Caelum Empyreum,</HI> which some o∣thers
of them are said to have asserted, supposing also the fixt Stars to be no∣thing
else but smaller Holes through this dark Shell. But these Conceptions
as too rude, gross, and favouring of vulgar Conceptions, I pass over and pro∣ceed
to observe to you further, that these Spots of the Sun are observed to
move generally all from East to West, and over the Face of the Sun, sometimes
coming in at the East Limb, and in 12, 13, 14, or 15 Days to move to the West
Limb, and to perform this Motion regularly for the most part, according to
an order of Sins, the Radius of the Sun being for the Radius, and the Order
beginning from the Center, which is another Demonstration that their Motion
is on the <HI>Superficies</HI> of a Sphere, and that they move on it almost equal Spaces
in equal times, I say almost equal; because they have a kind of Motion of
their own, whereby they are sometimes as it were promoted and sometimes
hindered, sometimes carried a little towards the North, and sometimes a little
towards the South. This Motion of theirs from East to West, over the Face
of the Sun, sometimes appears to us to be made in a straight Line, which hap∣pens
when the Earth is in that part of the plain of the Ecliptick, which cuts the
Plain of the Equinoctial of the Sun's turbinated Motion, which is twice a Year,
<HI>viz.</HI> in the beginning of <HI>June</HI> and <HI>December:</HI> At other times the Line of the
Motion of them is incurvated and bent into an Ellipse, which is greatest when
the Earth happens to be in those parts of the Ecliptick, which are the extream
Limits of it, compar'd to the Plain of the Sun's Equinoctial, which is also
twice a Year, <HI>viz.</HI> in the middle, between the Nodes, both Plains passing
through the Center of the Sun, that is, about the beginning of <HI>March</HI> and <HI>Sep∣tember.</HI>
From whence also is deduced another undeniable Demonstration, that
the Sun's <HI>Superficies</HI> is Globular, and that it moves round upon its <HI>Axis</HI> from
West to East, as the Earth and <HI>Jupiter</HI> also are proved to do. And another
Remark is likewise evidenced, that this <HI>Axis</HI> of the Sun's turbinated Motion,
remains fixt and directed toward the same parts of the Heavens. In the same
manner as the <HI>Axis</HI> of the Earth is observed to do, and likewise the <HI>Axis</HI> of ♃
and ♄, so far as we can yet discover by the Spots, Ring, and the Satellits of
<PB N="88" REF="122"/>
those Bodies. So that the Method of Nature in most things agrees both in our
and other Globous Bodies of the Universe. There is yet one Observation more
concerning these Spots, which further confirms this Deduction, and that is that
there is a certain torrid Zone, as I may call it from its Similitude to the torrid
Zone of the Earth, <HI>viz.</HI> a certain Space or Breadth on each side of the Aequa∣tor
of the Sun towards the North and South Poles, in which these Clouds,
Smokes, Blazes, or Spots are observed to appear most: Whereas without those
Limits, or in the two temperate Zones, they appear more seldom, and those
which do are only <HI>Nebulae</HI> or Clouds; but in the two Polar Zones there appear
none at all.</P>
<P>How great a Similitude there appears in this with the Globe of the Earth,
I need not now insist on, only I shall make this Remark by the by from this
Similitude, that though all that have hitherto spoken concerning this Subject,
have concluded that the time of the Revolution of the Sun's Body upon its
<HI>Axis,</HI> is to be deduced from the Revolution of some Spots that have lasted
more than quite round the Body of the Sun, and come to the same Place again,
in which they were 29 Days before or thereabouts. I must upon this occasion,
I say, remark that here upon the Earth, between and near the Tropicks, we
always have a continual Brieze of Air, which moves from East to West; which
upon very good Reason is concluded by <HI>Galileo,</HI> and most of our Modern Natu∣ralists,
to proceed from the Earths moving from West to East, and so leaving
the Air behind, which lagging of the Air is yet much more considerably felt
and perceived in the higher Parts of it by the Clouds, and by the Passage of
it over the tops of high Hills. So that if these Spots be Clouds or Smoke, or
somewhat Analogous to them, rais'd into the Air, Atmosphere, or some Fluid
Analogous to the Earth's Atmosphere, as I shall observe by and by, then may
the Motion of the solid Globe of the Sun be considerably swifter than those
Clouds appear to be carried, and instead of being 25 Days, possibly may make
a Revolution in 20 Days or sooner.</P>
<P>These Particulars I have here mentioned, I could have more largely de∣monstrated
to you by Schemes and Figures, whereby every Particular I have
asserted of this Matter might have been more fully shewn and explained. But
I do rather avoid it; First, because in Demonstrations of that kind very few
Auditors are able to go along with the Description and Quotations of Lines
and Letters in the Schemes; and Secondly, because it spends more time with
much less Advantage to the Auditory.</P>
<P>3. I shall then in the next Place remark to you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Suns Rays carry Heat as well as Light.</NOTE> That the Rays of the Sun
are observed to carry with them Hear, or to produce it in the Bodies upon
which they fall, especially if they be collected by the help of a reflecting or
a refracting Burning glass: Insomuch that by those means it is easy to set Bo∣dies
into an actual Flame and Fire; nay, not only to set Bodies on fire and con∣sume
them, but even to melt the most stubborn Bodies. Insomuch that none of
the Metals, as Tin, Lead, Silver, Brass, Copper, Iron, Gold, are able to in∣dure
it without being in a Moment almost melted, and nor only these, but
Stones, Clay, Flints, Bricks, and almost all other Bodies that will not burn,
will by the Power of the Sun's Rays, collected with a Burning glass, be mel∣ted
and turned into Glass to Admiration. Nay, 'tis possible by this means to
augment the Heat to almost any assigned Degree, and possibly some hundreds
times more than 'tis possible to perform by all the Artificial Fires that can be
made with any combustible Materials we yet know: Of which Effects, and
the Causes and Proprieties thereof, more hereafter. Now after all this, there
have not been wanting divers Men who would needs perswade us, that not∣withstanding
all these Observations the Body of the Sea has no Heat, nor have
the Rays themselves, but that they produce Heat and Fire only by agitating
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon which they fall, and are reflected; and this is the Reason (say
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the upper Parts of the Air are so very cold, and the under Parts
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Ground are so very hot, for the Rays of the Sun, say they, being in
themselves perfectly cold in passing thorough the upper Air; and being not re∣flected▪ they cause no Agitation or Heat, but being reflected from the Earth in the under Parts of the Air, the cross Agitation causeth the Parts of the Air to beat one
<PB N="89" REF="123"/>
against another, and this causeth Heat much in the same manner as a Flint and
Steel being struck one against another, though neither of them be hot before
they meet together; yet when they meet, produce both Heat, Fire, and Light,
though there were no sensible Signs of any of these before, and so a piece of
cold Iron may by being hammer'd on a cold Anvil with a cold Hammer, very
nimbly and stongly, be not only heated so as to burn ones Fingers, and to fire
Gunpowder, but to be visibly red hot: So that though the Hammer and the
Anvil were both in themselves devoid of Heat, yet their Motion does produce
it on the Iron. To this it may be answered, that as to the Warmth of the Air
at the bottom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the upper Air is colder.</NOTE> and the Coldness at the top of the Mountains, or high Towers,
the reason is plain from this, that the Air near the Earth is warmed by the
Heat of the Earth, and being not so swiftly moved and changed for cold Air,
as that which is at the tops of Mountains, or of very high Towers, which is
also further removed from the warm Surface of the Earth: But that the Rays of
the Sun will do the same thing as to burning of any Body by the help of a refract∣ing
burning Glass at the top of a Hill or Tower, there is no manner of reason
to doubt. 'Tis, I think, sufficiently evident to all the World, that Heat is con∣vey'd
by the Sun Beams as well as Light, and that those Beams both of Light
and Heat are emitted by the Sun, and therefore we have no more reason to be∣lieve,
that the Sun has no Light than that it has no Heat.</P>
<P>4. All these Circumstances consider'd, it seems very reasonable to conclude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That the Sun has an Atmo∣sphere, or some∣thing like it.</NOTE>
that the Superficies of this great Body of the Sun is incompassed with an Air or
Atmosphere, or some other fluid Body or Menstruum, even as this Body of the
Earth; and that this Atmosphere, though possibly 80 times thicker than the
Thickness and Height of the Atmosphere about the Earth, yet compared to the
Vastness of the Diameter of the Body, it becomes wholly invisible to us, though
assisted with our best Telescopes: And besides, 'tis not to be doubted, but that
being very near the Body, and having reflective Parts in it, it must of it self
look as bright as the very Body it self, and consequently that the Limb thereof
which appears to us is really the Shell of the Atmosphere, Air, or fluid Men∣struum
about the Sun, and not the very solid Body it self that shines. Hence
all the Phaenomena of the <HI>Maculae</HI> and <HI>Faculae</HI> of the Sun observed will be sol∣ved,
and these Spots of the Sun will be no other than our Clouds or Smokes,
which rise into the Atmosphere; this I say, will plainly make out all their Ap∣pearances
to be much the same as those of Clouds are here with us. For 'tis not
to be doubted, but that we have sometimes Clouds big enough to hinder the
Sun from shining upon as great a part of the Earth's Surface, as those Clouds
of the Sun do hinder us from seeing of the Sun's Surface.</P>
<P>Hence 'twill be easy to know why they sometimes move a little Northwards,
and sometimes a little Southwards, but will follow the general Course of the
Sun's Body, why the black Spots generally vary their Shape, regularly as on a
Spherical Surface, but that the bright ones do not, but seem to grow otherwise;
why the bright ones appear most near the Limb of the Sun, and not so often in
the middle; namely, where we come to see the Light reflected from the under
sides of the Spot, or Cloud: This gives a clear reason why they stay so long
about the Limb, and why they grow bigger, whereas the dark grow less and
sooner vanish. And in short, there is no Observation of these Spots in the Face
of the Sun that I have even yet made my self or seen of others, but will hereby
be clearly made out.</P>
<P>So that upon all that has been thus far said concerning the Body of the Sun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sun in most pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>prietie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a∣gree<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the Earth except that of Light.</NOTE>
it plainly appears, that it agrees with the Terraqueo-Aerial Globe in divers of
its Proprieties, and I shall another time prove to you several other Particulars,
by which it will plainly appear, that they perfectly agree in most other Pro∣prieties
except Light, and wherein that difference consists I shall likewise
show.</P>
<P>I am the more particular (upon this occasion) in my Description of the Sun,
because as it is the very Fountain of all visible Light, and the most considerable
Body in the World: So the Proprieties of this being explain'd, it will the more
clearly discover to us what are the most considerable Proprieties of Light in
<PB N="90" REF="124"/>
other Luminous Bodies, and thence we may be able fully to explain this Sub∣ject,
which is the most operative and most considerable Ingredient of the Uni∣verse.</P>
<P>5. Having thus shewn you that it is necessary there must be a fluid Body in∣compassing
the solid Body of the Sun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">There must be a fluid Body en∣compassing a more solid in the Sun, with more concerning the Spots.</NOTE> for otherwise those irregular Motions of
the Spots cannot be made out, and with the supposal of it, may be made
out and explained very rationally, I shall now more particularly shew you the
Reasons thereof. All that have hitherto made accurate Observations concern∣ing
these Spots in the Sun, amongst which, I think, none has been more dili∣gent
and curious than the Learned and Ingenious Jesuite <HI>Shinar,</HI> in his <HI>Rosa Ur∣sina,</HI>
that the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the <HI>Maculae, Nebulae</HI> and <HI>Faculae,</HI> are much what
I have already given you an account of: And though there be one or two who
from some superficial and slight Observations, and from much of Fantcy have
pretended some other Motions of these Spots, and would thence conclude, that
they are not Clouds but some smaller Planets, so near the Body of the Sun, as
that they can never be seen, b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> when they are in their Perigean Conjunctions,
and so come between the Sun and our Eye; yet since they are disallowed of by
the most diligent and curious Inquirers into these Matters, and since I could ne∣ver
meet with any such my self, I have good reason to suspend my Assent to their
Conclusion, till by manifest Observations it shall <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to the contrary.
Certain it is, that the Bodies of <HI>Venus</HI> and <HI>Mencury</HI> when they have appeared
in the Face of the Sun, have been very differing in their form from those of the
usual Spots: For First, they appear round, which few or none of these Spots
are observed to do. Secondly, They have not been observed to have any <HI>Ne∣bulae</HI>
about them, which all the Spots that ever I have seen have always had.
And Thirdly, Their Motions have been so swift as to pass over the whole Face
of the Sun in a very short time, as in some few Hours; whereas these Spots
are at least 12 days, and sometimes longer. Fourthly, They are observed to
pass over in a straight Line, whereas these are very often observed to pass in an
Ellipse, <HI>quam proxime,</HI> and but twice a Year in a straight Line. Fifthly, They
pass over the Sun with an equal swiftness as to Sense whereas these pass with
very unequal, as I noted to you before, and according to the Proportions of
Sins. Sixthly, They make no stay in the Limb, which these Spots oft-times
are observed to do. It plainly follows therefore, that these Spots are very near
the Surface of the Sun, if not upon it.</P>
<P>I do not deny but that it is possible there may be the Bodies of other Planets
about the Sun, nearer than that of ☿, which by reason of their nearness to its
Body, may never appear but only at such time as they happen to be observed
whilst they pass under the Sun: But I never yet met with any certain Observa∣tion
from which I saw a necessity for making such a Conclusion; for the Possi∣bility
thereof is no ways a sufficient Argument for its Necessity, or so much as a
Probability; for all the Observations that have been made of these Spots at the
Limb make their stay rather longer than shorter than they ought to do, supposing
them upon the very Superficies of the Sun, and therefore they are so far from
being without the shining and bright Limb of the Sun, that 'tis manifest that
they are within it, that is, within the Superficies of the Atmosphere that incom∣passes
the Body of the Sun.</P>
<P>Now the supposing of such an Atmosphere or fluid Body to incompass the
solid Body of the Sun (for there is as great a necessity of a solid Body of the
Sun as there is of a fluid about it to make out the reason and cause of divers
other Proprieties of it, as I shall afterwards shew) will plainly and intelligi∣bly
make out all the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the Spots, and make it almost demonstrable
that these <HI>Maculae, Nebulae</HI> and <HI>Faculae</HI> of the Body of the Sun, are much of the
Nature of the Meteors raised up into our Atmosphere from the Earth, and, as
I shall by and by make appear, will plainly shew unto us from what cause the
Light of the Body proceeds. I have mentioned to you already, that the Spots
are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>served to stay considerably longer in the Limb of the Sun than they ought,
according to the Rule of moving upon the Superficies of an opacous Globe,
for it has been found that they appear, when according to that Rule
they should disappear; it follows therefore, that either they must lose their
<PB N="91" REF="125"/>
Regularity when they come to the apparent Limb of the Sun <HI>quoad nos,</HI> or else
that the edge of the Limb is <HI>aliquatenus</HI> transparent; for the former there can
be no imaginary Reason, there being no difference in that part of the Superfi∣cies
of the Sun from any other; because every part of the Sun successively is in
the Limb, and Spots arise promiscuously in any Part of its middle Zone: It
must therefore of necessity be from the Transparency of some small Shell, about
the solid shining Body, and therefore probably of an Atmosphere. But second∣ly,
'Tis manifest that this Atmosphere is moved much as our Atmosphere is;
for by many Observations it has been certainly found, that these Spots which
rise in the middle Zone of the Sun have been observed to be longer in passing
over the Sun's Disk, than those which happened in the Intermediate, which
perfectly agrees with the Motion of the Atmosphere about the Earth, for the
Air between and near the Tropicks is observed to lag and fall more behind the
Motion of the Earth than the Air in the temperate Zones; for in the Torrid
Zone the Air or Wind almost continually seems to blow from the East, or
from some Point of it, which is generally now concluded to proceed from that
Cause, I say for the most part from the East, or some Point of it, as East South-East,
or South-East, East-North-East or North-East, or the like, which ex∣plains
also why those Spots of the Sun are observed to move sometimes toward
the North-West, and sometimes towards the South-West: But then those in
the intermediate Zones follow the Course of the Sun's Body more easily, as
with us, where the Winds sometimes blow from the Westwards, and seem to
be moved faster than the Earth it self.</P>
<P>6. Having therefore as far as the thing is capable of Demonstration shew'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That the Sun is a solid and opacous Body.</NOTE>
that the Superficies of the Sun is fluid and somewhat transparent, and has
Motions in it analogous and very like to the Motions of our Atmosphere:
I come in the next place to observe to you, that the Body of the Sun it self with∣in
this Shell is a solid Body and opacous.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why solid.</NOTE>
Its Solidity I prove from three Pro∣prieties
here observable, and those are First, the Constancy of its Rotation;
Secondly, The Fixtness of its Axis; And thirdly, the Power of its Gravitation
or Attraction to its Center. First, I say, from the Constancy of its Rotation,
this is an Argument so plain, as nothing can be more, for we need go no further
than the Earth on which we tread, whose Rotation we find very certain and
constant, and none can yet prove but that it is always equal and uniform; in
that Motion whereas we see the fluid Bodies about it, as the Air, nothing is
more uncertain and unconstant than them, nay though it be guided by the Su∣perficies
of the Earth, nay the very Water which is contain'd in the Capacity of
the Earth, and so has much more reason to move round, than if all fluid: Yet
we see that this has great Varieties of Currents, Ebbings and Flowings, and the
like; especially in the great Ocean, though it be less in Seas inclosed, the same
we shall find if we make tryal with Water in a Dish, or Water about a Dish, and
the like▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich will presently confound a circular Motion that shall be impress'd
upon i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and so must quickly stand still, whereas we find it quite otherwise,
and to continue the same as it was first observed to do.</P>
<P>But then secondly, by reason of the Fixedness of the Axis of its Revolution,
this is a stronger Argument than the former for its Solidity; for there is no body
that we yet know that is fluid has any such Propriety as Magnetism or Dire∣ction,
and all that have a Magnetism are solid as the Earth, ♄, ♃, and the
Moon, the Magnet and Steel; nay, Steel being either melted or dissolved in
<HI>Aqua Fortis,</HI> and so made fluid, loseth its Virtue [And Iron heated red hot does
no more attract till cold, as having somewhat of Fluidity] and if it would
lose the Regularity of its turbinated Motion, then certainly much rather
would it lose the Direction of its Axis, if it were not a Solid: It follows there∣fore
that since 'tis evident from Observation, that this Axis keeps its Position
and Directio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ therefore that the Body of the Sun must be a solid and not a
fluid Body. The third Argument drawn from its attractive or gravitating
Power, to prove its Solidity, I cannot here stay to insist upon the Explication
of, because the reason thereof cannot so plainly appear without the Explica∣tion
of a whole Theory of Gravity, which will come in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re properly under
another Head, and therefore I can only tell you, that the Explication of the
<PB N="92" REF="126"/>
Cause of Gravity will clearly prove that the Body that has Gravitation strictly so
called, must have also Solidity. Now that it has such an Attraction or Gravita∣tion,
I shall prove first from its Spherical Figure; 2dly, From the Motion of these
Spots; and 3dly, From the Motions of all the other primary Planets, whose
Motions as I have many Years since shewed in this Place, are all influenced and
modulated by the attractive Power of this great Body. This also as the for∣mer,
I must for the present refer to that Head to be more fully explained and
demonstrated, and only name it at present.</P>
<P>In the next place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why Opaque.</NOTE> that the Body within the Atmosphere or transparent Shell,
is opacous, I argue from the disappearing of the Spots in the Limb, and their
not returning backwards as they would seem to do if the Body were transpa∣rent
as the Atmosphere is, or the Flame of a Candle, or the Radiations, or ha∣zy
Light about the Nucleus of a Comet, through which as through its Beard.
I have seen small fixt Stars.</P>
<P>7. We find then,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eight Particulars in which the Sun and Earth agree. Three wherein they differ.</NOTE> that thus far the Proprieties of the Body of the Sun do
seem to agree with the Proprieties of the Body of the Earth: As first, in its
Globular Figure: 2dly, In its Rotation; 3dly, In its Gravity; 4thly, In its
Polar Directions; 5thly, In its Atmosphere; 6thly, In the Motions of that
Atmosphere; 7thly, In attracting Planetary Bodies, 8thly, In the Fixtness of
its Axis or Polarity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But then in the next Place they differ, first in Magnitude, the comparative
Quantities of each I shew'd you before. 2dly, In the Make of the Surface,
that of the Earth being rugged and unequal, but that or the Sun as far as yet
can be discovered, very equal and smooth. 3dly, In their Qualities, the Sun's
Surface being both hot and light, and that of the Earth dark and cold; that
thererore which would afford these Proprieties to the Body of the Earth would
make the Earth on which we tread a Sun▪ These two Proprieties then we find
Fire to supply▪ If therefore the Surface or the Earth were made and compound∣ed
of Nitro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and Sulphureous Particles, or such like combustible Substances,
and that they were once set on fire, I see no reason why the Earth should not
be in all respects the same to the Moon as the Sun is to the Earth: Nor is
there any reason why all the other Proprieties of the Earth that it now hath,
excepting those of Coldness and Opacity, should not remain much the same. If
therefore we further suppose (I say suppose for I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o not now intend in this Place
to prove that 'tis really and positively so, and not otherwise, though I shall af∣terwards
from other Arguments demonst<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ably prove it) that the solid Body of
the Sun is made or compounded of such Materials as will really work one upon
another, and dissolve or burn each other, as we find Sulphur and Nitre do,
or any Sulphureous Body, and the Air when rightly joyned. From this Hypo∣thesis,
I say, for I will not presume to call it more at present, I conceive all
the Phaenomena of the Sun will be made very easily intelligible, and be shew'd
to be perfectly consonant with the other Processes of Nature, which is a very
probable Argument at least that really it is even so done and not other∣wise.</P>
<P>1. First then I say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Phaenome∣na of the Sun explained.</NOTE> supposing the Superficies of a Body as big as the Sun to
consist of such Materials as would really work upon each other, and conse∣quently
burn, as violently as some Materials which are here upon the Earth
would do if once set on Fire, I say the Surface of such a Body at such a Distance
so burning, must give to the Earth a very considerable Light and Heat.</P>
<P>First for Light, It is evident by Experiment that Nitre and Sulphur burning
each other, make a very bright Light; insomuch, that few Eyes can indure to
look upon it, and is as intolerable almost as the Light of the Sun. Now 'tis ve∣ry
probable, that the Materials that maintain the Fire of the Sun are yet much
more adapted for that purpose, and therefore that this Light and Heat may
much exceed it, but still this doth not make the Action of it differ, nor make it
really differ in <HI>Specie</HI> from a Fire made with Earthy Materials but only in de∣grees,
and therefore still supposing the whole Superficies of the Sun to afford
as much Light in every visible part of it, as these Bodies so burning do, accor∣ding
to the Bigness of their Surface; it must necessarily very strongly affect the
<PB N="93" REF="127"/>
Earth, though placed at this Distance; for all Light in the first place propagates
<HI>in infinitum</HI> in an Instant. Now the <HI>Medium</HI> between the Sun and us being
perfectly transparent, and so nothing of the Light being lost but only rarify'd, it
follows, that we must receive the same Proportion of the Light of such a Body
as we do now of the Light of the Body of the Sun as now it is: So that
thence the only Difference must consist in the Proportion of the Light of the Bo∣dies;
that is, whether the Light of any one part of the Sun equal to an Artifi∣cial
Fire so made, be any thing brighter: For if they be equal, as 'tis very
possible they may, then the same Effects will follow. Now the Question will
be, how shall this be proved or tried, whether this be so or not? We cannot go
to the Sun, nor fetch Fire from Heaven, as <HI>Prometheus</HI> is said to have done: Nor
can we set or remove our Fire so far distant from us, as to make an equal Com∣parison
of the one with the other. I grant it, we cannot; but yet Art may
help us to a way, by which we may be able to ascend thither by Reason, and
be as much assured of it as if we actually did it: And that is, by knowing in
what Proportion the Quantity of Light does diminish, according to the distance
it is propagated from the Luminous Body; for by that means, we may mea∣sure
<HI>Hercules</HI> by his Foot, from exact Observations made of the Power of Lu∣minous
Bodies in propagating Light here with us, we may calculate the Power
of Luminous Bodies, though never so far distant. Light then, as I formerly
hinted, doth decrease in Duplicate Proportion to its distance of Propagation
from the Luminous Body, that is in the same Proportion with the Superficies
of the Spheres of Distance.</P>
<P>For suppose A the Luminous Point,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Proportion of the Diminu∣tion of Light. <HI>Fig. 4. Plate</HI> 1.</NOTE> that emits a Quantity of Light to fill the
Space ABB; this Light in the next Space fills BBcc, then ccdd, then
ddEE: And at EE it is arrived at twice the Distance of BB from A. The
Power therefore of this Ray of Light which at BB was all contained within
the circular Base of the Cone ABB, is by that it acts at the Distance EE ex∣panded
into the circular Base of the Cone AEE; Namely, into the Circle
EE, which Circle being twice the Bigness of BB in Diameter, must have its
Area Quadruple to the Area of BB. And so of FF, which is at treble the
Distance, the Area of the circular Base of the Cone AFF will be Nine times
the Area of BB, and so onward the Areas increase in a Duplicate Proportion
of the Distance of them, from the Apex of the Cone, or which is the same
from the Luminous Point A.</P>
<P>The Power therefore of Light thus propagated will be diminished or rari∣fied,
so that at twice the Distance it will have but a Quarter of the Power at
thrice the Distance, but one Ninth at Four times the Distance, but 1/26 at five
times the Distance, but 1/25 part of the Power which it had at one Space of
Distance: And consequently the Proportion of the Power of Light at any one
Distance, to the Power of the Light at any other Distance, will be reciprocally
Duplicate to the respective Distances, as the Power of Light at five Spaces Di∣stance
to that at fix Spaces Distance, will be as 1/25 to 1/36, that is as 36 to 25;
for as 1/25, 1/36:: 36. 25. which are the Squares of the Distances reciprocally
taken. This, I say, is the Expansion of Light according to the various Di∣stances
of its Action from the Luminous Body, and according to this Rule all
Light is found to act and diminish its Power in Proportion to its greater Di∣stance.
So that the Power of any Artificial Light, as Fire, Flame, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being
found at any measurable Distance, the Power of it may be easily found for
any assignable Distance be it never so great: And on the contrary, the Power
of Natural Light, as that of the Sun, Moon, Planet, or Stars, being found
by Experiment at an assigned Distance, though never so great, the Power of
it may be found by Calculation at any assigned Distance, though never so near,
and consequently we have a means of truly calculating the comparative Power
of Natural and Artificial Lights from Experiments made on each of them.
But then secondly, We have another thing to be taken notice of in our Calcu∣lation,
to make the Comparison compleat and exact, and that is of the Area
of the Luminous Body, for 'tis not enough to calculate the Power of one
<PB N="94" REF="128"/>
Point only, but the Power of an Aggregate of them must also be taken notice
of. And this is of the Cone inverted, and turned the other way, where the
Apex of the Cone is the Eye, or the Point of the Subject inlightned, and
the Base is in the Luminous Body, as the Disk of the Sun, and this by suppo∣sing
the Ray in all Degrees of Distance equally strong, does diminish the
Power of inlightning in Proportion to the visible Angle, under which it ap∣pears
at greater or greater Distances. This therefore will also be in Dupli∣cate
Proportion to the Distance reciprocally taken; for the Area of Light
must subtend equal Angles or Cones to make an equal Light, and therefore
at double Distance there must be Four times the Area of Light to make the
same Effect, and at treble Distance Nine times the Light, and at Quadruple
Distance Sixteen times the Luminous Area to produce the same Effect upon
the Subject. A circular Area therefore of as bright a Light, or shining Body
as the Sun, being placed at such a Distance as that it may appear under
much same Conical Angle as the Sun doth, <HI>viz.</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>/2 a Degree, must give as
Light to the Subject as the Sun it self.</P>
<P>From these two Considerations, 'twill be easy to calculate the comparative
Power of naturally Luminous Bodies to the Power of such as are artificially,
or to compare the Light of the Sun with the Light of Coles, Flame, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
to see their Differences.</P>
<P>From which I question not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Light from the Sun caused by an actual Fire.</NOTE> but that there may be very cogent Arguments
drawn to prove, that the Light of this Body of the Sun may be caused by an
actual Fire, or Dissolution of the superficial Parts thereof; partly by the At∣mosphere
or Air incompassing it, and partly also by the Constituents of it mix∣ed
together into one Mass, which have Analogy with our Sulphur and Nitre,
which do work upon and burn each other, and so the Sun will be found to
be a vast Globular Body, whose whole Superficies is in a continual Dissolu∣tion
or Fire; partly by the working of its constituent Parts one upon another,
and partly also by the Assistance of the Atmosphere, Air, or Fluid Body, in∣compassing
it. And thence we may deduce, that the Physical or Natural
Cause of its Light, is the actual Fire or burning of its superficial Parts;
which being proved, or supposed so, all the Appearances that have been hi∣therto
taken notice of concerning Clouds, Spots, and Blazes, will be very na∣turally
and clearly solved; and there is no one Observation I have yet made,
or met with in other Authors, that do any way seem to cross or thwart it.
Matters of Fact none can deny, that such Changes and Alterations do happen,
and I conceive it will be as easily granted, that they have their Natural Cau∣ses.
And therefore that which doth with most likelihood solve them, is at
least the most probable Cause.</P>
<P>But some may object and say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Objection answered.</NOTE> that if this were so, certainly the Body of
the Sun in so many Thousand Years would have been all consumed, at least
would have grown sensibly less. Suppose this were granted and said, that it
has grown some Minutes less since it first began to give Light, none could con∣tradict
it by any Observations we have upon Record; for we have no Astro∣nomical
Observations of that kind 2000 Years at least, that could evidence
the contrary. But supposing we had Observations of 4000 Years standing,
and that they had found the Diameter of the Sun to be as many Minutes as
'tis now, yet that would have been no Argument but that the Sun might have
every Year been a Mile less in Diameter than it was the preceding Year, and
consequently been 4000 Miles less in Diameter than it was 4000 Years ago.
No Observation never so carefully made, either then or now, could have
contradricted it: For if the Sun's Diameter be near 87 times bigger than the
Diameter of the Earth, and the Earths Diameter be near 8000 Miles, the Dia¦meter
of the Sun must be near 696000 Miles, and 4000 is but a 174 part
of the Diameter, and consequently could have diminisht it but about <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of a
Minute, which is a much less Quantity than the An<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ients pretended to ob∣serve to.
But supposing they could have observed even to Seconds, yet that
<PB N="95" REF="129"/>
could not have contradicted it, since as I shall upon occasion shew a Reason,
why the Sun may have approacht as much as to recompence that Defect.
But I have not now time to explain it: And shall only add, that this being
so, it will thence very rationally follow, that the Stars also being very pro∣bably
Bodies in most Proprieties the same with the Sun, will be Bodies also
whose Superficies do actually burn consonant to which the Observation of
the Noble <HI>Tycho,</HI> and others of the Stars that appear'd in <HI>Cassiopeia,</HI> in the
Year 1572 will be judged to be all fir'd together, and so quite burnt out in
one Year; for it lasted no longer, and did never appear before, nor has since
that I can hear of. Consonant to this Theory, will be the Appearances of
Comets, of which kind I this Week observed one in the Sign of <HI>Scorpio.</HI>
But of this Matter I have elsewhere discoursed somewhat already, and shall
add more hereafter upon another Opportunity, when I come to explain
what the Cause of Light is in Fire, and other Luminous Bodies here below
within our reach; the Explanation of which will manifestly demonstrate to us
what 'tis in all other Bodies whatsoever that are out of our Reach.</P>

<HEAD>The CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<Q>1. Light the most admirable Effect of Nature, one of the principal Pow∣ers
by which every part of the great Existence of Material Beings is
united and made one. The Infiniteness or Indefiniteness of the active
Power of Light already explained; the smaller the Stars appear, the
greater is their Distance; the reason why some before invisible are made
visible by Telescopes, because few Eyes can be affected by any Object
under a less Angle than a Minute; thence several small Stars coalesce
into one, and why some of the fixt Stars, though less than a Minute,
as but of a second, are yet visible; an Objection against the use of Te∣lescopes
in Astronomical Observations answered, and why the Stars ap∣pear
less through a Telescope than to the naked Eye. 2. An Explica∣tion
aad Confirmation of <HI>Des Cartes</HI> Hypothesis of Vision, and that
the fixt Stars are really at different Distances, though they may be also
of different Magnitudes, a farther Reason that the Propagation of Light
must be instantaneous. 3. The innate Light of all Celestial Luminous
Bodies proceeds from an actual and real Fire something like that on
the Earth, though not altogether the same, the Fuel being possibly dif∣ferent.
4. By this the Subject of the Inquiry is brought nearer, viz.
on combustible Substances, whereon we may exercise our Scrutinies with
more Power, to find the Cause of Light and Fire, and by Analogy,
what it is in the Sun: Which therefore is to be the Subject of future
Discourses. 5. Of the Nature of Comets, which are another sort of
Celestial Fire, which ought to be examined before the treating of Ter∣restrial
and Culinary Fires, and whose Light is different from that of the
Sun, Stars or Planets, their different Appearances have caused great dif∣ference
in Writers of them. The three Opinions mention'd by <HI>Seneca</HI>
in his Natural Questions enumerated, with those of other Ancient and
Modern Philosophers.</Q>
<P>1. I Began the last Term to explain to you several of the Proprieties of Light,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Light the most admirable Effect in Na∣ture.</NOTE>
as being one of the most admirable Effects of Nature which are subjected
to our Senses, and consequently to our Speculation and Contemplation, as be∣ing
one of the first and principal of the Powers of the great System of the
World, by which the whole is united and made one; and every one part of that
unconceivably great Existence of Material Beings is affected by every other,
which may thence not improperly be called one Body, or the only Material or
Corporeal Being, distinct from which no other Corporeal being is.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="131"/>
This by <HI>Moses,</HI> in the History of the Creation, is comprehended under the
double Name of Heaven and Earth, denoting both, one material Being; but
considered in its parts, Namely, fluid and solid Matter. After the Creation of
which God said, Let there be Light and there was Light, so that the first a∣ctive
Power was Light.</P>
<P>Some of the Proprieties of this active Power I have already explained:
Namely, first its indefinite Extension to every part of the whole of Matter,
which because our Imagination can set no Bounds or Limits to; I therefore call
infinite or indefinite, not as supposing it to be really so, but for that, as our
Senses inform us of no such Bound, so neither can our Imagination fix the <HI>ne plus
ultra,</HI> beyond which no Material Being can exist. For wherever we put it, we
presently suppose Space and Extension beyond it, and that at least if it be not
Body, as <HI>Des Cartes</HI> would have it; yet it has the inseparable Propriety of Bo∣dy
and Matter, namely, Extension: And no one has yet told us, what Body is
distinct from Extension, or what is the true Essence of Body or Material Being,
besides Extension; and 'tis as easy to conceive indefinite Body, as indefinite
Extension. Nor indeed can Extension be well conceived without the Notion
of Body, no more than Body can without the Notion of Extension:
for Extension is nothing but the abstracted Notion of somewhat extended:
And therefore if there be Extension, there must be somewhat extended.
Now if it be not the Propriety of Spirits, as all Divines and Philosophers con∣clude,
but only of Body, then wherever there is Extension, there is really a Bo∣dy
extended; and therefore since our Imagination can never limit Extension, so
neither can they set Bounds to Matter or Material Being.</P>
<P>Now I told you, that our Eyes assisted by the help of Glasses inform us that
Light is propagated or communicated to us from utmost inconceivable Distan∣ces,
at least if we believe the vast Distances the Stars are placed from us, and
that the smaller the Stars are the greater is their Distance: For still the lon∣ger
and better our Telescopes are the more are there discovered of small Stars
which were before, and without that Help invisible; not for that they did not
affect the Eye with Light without, as well as with the help of the Telescope,
but because the Power of the Eye is limited to a certain Magnitude of Appear∣ance,
under which nothing can be distinctly perceived: Whatsoever Object
therefore affects the Eye under a less Angle than that Eye can distinguish, be∣comes
invisible or not seen. Now whereas most Eyes distinguish not a less
Angle than a Minute, or the 60th part of a Degree, or the 21600 part of a
Circle, therefore whatever is sensated or seen by it, is seen of that Bigness or
under that Angle: And so if there be 2 or 3, or 10 or 100 small Stars so near
together as that they are all comprised within the Angle of one Minute, the
Eye has a Sensation of them all, as if they were one Star, and distinguishes
them not one from another; so likewise is it, that if the Light be strong and
powerful so as to affect the Eye, it always appears of the Bigness of a Minute,
though possibly its real Angle be not a second. Thence every Star that such an
Eye discovers, appears to be of the Bigness of a Minute at least, and so it is
conceived really to be, though yet when we come to examine its Diameter by
the help of Telescopes, we really find it to be but some few seconds or sixti∣eth
Parts of such an Angle; and hence it is, that it is told as a very great
Wonder, and is indeed as a great Argument objected against the Use of Tele∣scopes,
that there can be no Truth in the Discoveries made by them: For that
though they are found to magnify and increase the Appearance of all other Ob∣jects
except the Stars; yet when they are viewed through them they appear
to be rather lessened than increased in Bulk, whence they conclude of that
Instrument that does sometimes magnify and sometimes not, and indeed both
at the same time (as when one looks on two Stars 10 Minutes distant from each
other, their Distance is really augmented though their apparent Diameters seem
not to be at all) they conclude, I say, that all the Appearances through such
an Instrument are uncertain and imperfect, and real Misinformations, and con∣sequently
nothing but Phantomes and false Representations; and this Conside∣ration
or indeed Inconsideration hath been the occasion why several otherwise
very ingenious and knowing Men have been prejudiced against the making use
of Telescopes, and other Optick Glasses, for the Discovery of Nature, for not
<PB N="98" REF="132"/>
knowing how to answer to themselves these and some such other Objections
as easily answerable, if well considered, they have fallen into a Disbelief of
the whole Information these Helps afford us; and will therefore in all Obser∣vations
on which they build any thing; only make use of the naked Eye:
Whereas had they made use of these Helps, they would have been able to have
made much greater Advances in their Discoveries and Observations.</P>
<P>To answer this Objection therefore against the Truth of the Discoveries of
Telescopes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Objection against the use of Telescopes answered.</NOTE> and those of Microscopes, I say; that these Instruments do equally
magnify the real Angle, under which any Object appears to the naked Eye,
and so doe equally magnify the real Angle of the Stars, as well as of any
other Object, and that the Fallacy lies in the Eye and not in the Instrument:
For as I said, such is the make of the sensible part of the Eye, <HI>viz.</HI> of the <HI>Tu∣nica
Retina,</HI> that it cannot distinguish in most Eyes an Angle less than a Mi∣nute
(though there be some that can to the third of a Minute, but these are
very few) whence if there be any strong shining Object that does very power∣fully
operate on the Eye, so as to create a Sensation, and yet does really act
under an Angle only of some few seconds; yet because the Eye cannot distin∣guish
a less Angle than a Minute, the Object is supposed to be a Minute in Big∣ness:
And so if the Telescope do not so far increase the real Diameter of the
Object as to make it more than a Minute, it does seem indeed not at all to
magnify it; because it is still made to appear, but under the Angle of a Mi∣nute.
<HI>Des Cartes</HI> has a very ingenious Explication of the <HI>Tunica Retina,</HI> or the
way of Vision, which does very intelligibly make out the reason of this Pro∣priety
in the Eye: Which possibly it may not be amiss now a little to explain,
that some Prejudices may be removed, against Arguments that are deduced
from Observations made with Telescopes, and some other Optical Glasses.</P>
<P>2. “He explains then (as <HI>Porta, Kepler, Shinar, Galileo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Des Caries Hypothesis of Vision.</NOTE> and many others
that had treated of that Subject before him do) the Organ of Vision the
Eye, by the Similitude of it to a dark Room, into which no other Light is
admitted but what enters by one round Hole, in which a convenient Con∣vex
refracting <HI>Lens</HI> is placed so, as to collect all the Rays from Objects
without, and to unite them in their distinct and proper places upon a Wall
or Sheet of Paper at a covenient Distance within; whereby the Picture of
all those Objects that are without the Room, is made as it were and placed
upon the Wall or Sheet within: This Sheet says he in the Eye, is the <HI>Tunica
Retina,</HI> on which the Picture of all Objects without the Eye are as it were
painted and described. Now this Picture on the <HI>Tunica Retina</HI> is nothing
but the Impression of the several Rays from the Objects without, collected
by the help of the <HI>Cornea</HI> and <HI>Crystalline,</HI> as by the Convex Glass in the dark
Room. And the <HI>Retina</HI> being like a piece of Plush, with the ends of the
Threads turn'd towards the <HI>Crystalline,</HI> all the other ends of them being termi∣nated
in the <HI>Brain,</HI> there can be no more distinct Sensations than there are
distinct Threads to convey the Impression on them: So that if the whole Pi∣cture
of the Object be smaller than one single Thread of this Plush, it can∣not
affect or move a less part than one of those small Threads or Filaments
of the <HI>Retina,</HI> and therefore the Sensation is the same as if the Object did
take up or cover the whole end of the Thread or Filament, though it affect
but a tenth part of it provided it be strong.”</P>
<P>I have been the more particular in the Explication of this, because since my
former explaining of the indefinite extensive Power of Light, I have met with
some that have objected against the Reality of the Appearances through Tele∣scopes,
as if no Arguments drawn from Observation, made by the Help of such
were to be esteemed of any force, whereas indeed all such Objections do only
proceed from an Ignorance of the Grounds of Opticks and of Vision, we being
equally as certain of the Appearances we discover by them, as of those things
which are discovered and seen by the naked Eye. It was by some of the An∣cients
conjectur'd, that the <HI>Galaxia</HI> or Milky Way was nothing else but a great
number of Stars, so small as that they could not be distinguish'd: Telescopes
have discovered the Truth of that Conjecture, and manifested it to be so, and
<PB N="99" REF="133"/>
we have henceforth no more reason to doubt that it is so, than we have to
doubt whether there are any Stars at all in the Heavens.</P>
<P>Others again I find to object,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That the fixt Stars are at different Di∣stances.</NOTE> that though there really be such a great Variety
of Magnitudes in the Appearances of the fixt Stars, yet it is uncertain whether
those Magnitudes do wholly proceed from the Distances of them, and not ra∣ther
from a real Difference in their Magnitudes, and if so, then all those Stars
both great and small may be at equal or very near equal Distances from the
Earth; and if so, then the Extensions of the Heavens need not be supposed so
vastly big, as if their appearing Magnitudes proceeded only from their Remote∣ness
from the Earth: To which I say as I did before explain, that I do sup∣pose
their appearing Magnitude to be caused by both; that is, Eirst by their
real Difference in Magnitude and in Brightness; and secondly, by their differ∣ing
Distance from us. The Visibleness of some proceeds from their extraordina∣ry
Vividness of Light, as that of the Great Dog-star, which though it be the
most conspicuous Star in the Heavens, is yet found by the Telescopes ro be
less in Diameter than several others which appear not so confpicuous: As that
of the Bull's Eye.</P>
<P>And this by the way seems to be the reason of the Appearance of the New
Star in <HI>Cassiopea,</HI> observed by <HI>Ticho Brahc,</HI> and by divers other eminent Astro∣nomers
of that time, which from a Star of the third Magnitude increased to
be of the Bigness of <HI>Venus,</HI> and more conspicuous than any other fixt Star in
the Heaven, and yet in less than a Year it diminished by degrees and went out
wholly, and hath not since appeared; all which time of its Appearance it per∣fectly
kept the same place without any Variation, so that in Probability it was
a fixt Star before of a very dull Light, and so invisible till by some Constitu∣tion
in its make, as some more combustible Shell or Orb of its Body, it then
burnt or shined out more conspicuously, which Shell being once consumed, it
again disappeared, and has since that time been no more seen.</P>
<P>Others again, that to the naked Eye appear one Star, and that very conspi∣cuous,
by the Telescope are discover'd to be two or more Stars, so near toge∣ther
as that the Eye cannot distinguish between them, both the Images of them
falling upon one single Filament of the <HI>Tunica Retina,</HI> and so both of them
making but one Impression on the Brain; of this kind the most remarkable is
the Star in the Left Horn of <HI>Aries,</HI> which whilst I was observing the Comet
which appeared in the Year 1664. and followed till he past by this Star, I took
notice that it consisted of two small Stars very near together: A like Instance
to which I have not else met with in all the Heaven, they seeming to be both
of rhem very near of equal Bigness, and yet so very near together, that you
will need a Telescope of a considerable Length to see them both distinct and
separate.</P>
<P>Others, I conceive, may be of equal Distance, and may yet appear of diffe∣ring
Magnitudes from their real Difference of Magnitude, the Body of the one
being so much bigger than the other as they appear.</P>
<P>But after all this, I conceive it very probable, that the greatest Number of
the small Stars appear such, not from any of these fore-mentioned Reasons, but
only because they are further distant from us: It may be objected perhaps,
that 'twill be very hard to prove, whether that be the Cause or not of such
their Appearance: But to this 1 answer, that though it hath not yet been posi∣tively
proved, yet as I mentioned in my Attempt to prove the Motion of the
Earth by Observations, I there hinted somewhat to this purpose, and it shall
not be long before I acquaint the World with what I have done in that kind.
So that for the present I shall say, that upon the whole there is no reason to
doubt, but that the extent of the Heavens is vastly beyond what we have hi∣therto
imagined, and consequently that the extent of the Propagation of Light
is equal with it, and therefore, notwithstanding these Objections that I former∣ly
laid down, remains without any solid Reason against it.</P>
<P>I proceeded next to shew that this Propagation of Light was to all imagina∣ble
Distance in a Moment or Instant of Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the instantaneous Mo∣tion of Light.</NOTE> insomuch that every one part of
the Universe might by this means be affected by every other part of it, and though
I then related some considerable Objections against it, and to prove its Propa∣gation
Temporaneous, that is to spend some considerable time in passing from
<PB N="100" REF="134"/>
the Lucid to the enlightned Body, if at a great Distance, yet as I shall after∣wards
prove by the Effects of Light, the Propagation must be instantaneous.</P>
<P>After this I explained what Light was in the Lucid Body: And for that
end more particularly described the Constitution and Make of the Body of the
Sun, as the principal and most considerable Body for Light as to us, and shewed
many Arguments to prove, that it is no other than a Body actually burning or
on Fire, that it has an Atmosphere that incompasses it, which may possibly be
the <HI>Menstruum</HI> that dissolves it, as the Air or Atmosphere about the Earth is
the <HI>Menstruum</HI> of burning Bodies here upon the Earth, that it did sometime
produce dark Spots or Clouds, which seem'd Analogous to our Smoke, and
sometimes brighter, which seem'd Analogous to our Flames. So that upon the
whole, I concluded it a solid Globous Body actually on fire in its superficial
Parts, and that from that Fire its Light and Heat proceeded.</P>
<P>The Light of the Moon and other Planets, both Secundary and Primary,
Telescopes do plainly evidence to proceed from the Reflection of the Sun's
Light, and therefore none of those can be properly said to be Luminous Bodies.
But the fixt Stars, as I have already mentioned, seem to be of the same Nature
with the Body of the Sun, and therefore the same Explanation that was given
of the Light in the Sun, will serve also for the Light of the Bodies of these
Stars. And thence, as I just now mentioned, a clear Reason will be given of
divers new Stars that have appeared and disappeared.</P>
<P>3. So that in Probability the Light of all the Celestial Bodies proceeds from
an actual Fire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Light of the Stars from an actual Fire.</NOTE> much of the same Nature with the Fires we here have burning
upon the Earth; and therefore if we find out what is the Nature of our Fire
here with us, we may from that explain how it is generated and how it ope∣rates
in the Heavens.</P>
<P>Not that I suppose, that the Fuel of the Celestial Fires is the same with our
Fuel here upon the Earth, as Sulphur, Bitumen, Stone-Cole, or other combu∣stible
Mineral Substances; or Woods, Resins, Oyls, or other Vegetable Sub∣stances,
or Fat, Bones, or such like Animal Substances; but that it may be of
Variety of other Substances very differing from any of these; for as all those
I have named are much different from one another, so may there be a Hun∣dred
other Substances distinct from any one of these, and distinct also one from
another, all of which may notwithstanding be of a Substance fit for the Disso∣lution
of that fluid <HI>Menstruum</HI> in which they swim, in the same manner as
these I have named are for the Dissolution of the <HI>Menstruum</HI> of the Air, and
so may be fit Fuel to maintain that Celestial Fire.</P>
<P>4. We have therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Nature of Fire.</NOTE> brought our Inquiry into Subjects much nearer to us
than either the Sun or fixt Stars, and into such as are within our Command
and Reach, into such as on which we may with more Power exercise our
Scrutinies and Examinations; in which, if by our Tryals and Examinations we
can find out what the efficient Cause of Fire and Light are, we shall by Ana∣logy
easily find out what is also the Cause of the Light in the Sun, and in the
fixt Stars, which Examination and Scrutiny into the Cause of Fire, and the
Light thereof, shall therefore be the Subject of some of our following Dis∣courses.</P>
<P>5. But before we leave the Contemplation of the Celestial Bodies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Comets.</NOTE> and be∣gin
our <HI>Examination</HI> of Terrestrial or Culinary Fires, the late appearing Co∣met
puts me in mind of another kind of Light, which is thought by most to be
of a quite differing Nature from those of the Sun, Stars, or Planets, and not
to be at all Analogous to them.</P>
<P>The great Variety of Form there has been amongst those that have appeared
at several Times, and in several Ages of the World, and the great Alterations
there have happened almost in every one that appeared before it disappear,
has so much confounded Mens Judgments concerning them, that you shall
hardly find two Men agreeing in all things, to the same Opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="135"/>
<HI>Seneca</HI> in the Nineteenth Chapter of his seventh Book of Natural Questions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Opinions concerning them.</NOTE>
recites three Opinions concerning <HI>Comets.</HI> Some, says he, think that no Comet
does really exist, but that the Appearance thereof is made only by the Conjuncti∣on
of the Rays of several Stars or Celestial Bodys into one Point, and a Reper∣cussion
or spreading of them from thence: <HI>Quidam nullos esse Cometas existimant,
sed species illorum per repercussionem vicinorum siderum, aut per Conjunctionem
vicinorum reddi.</HI></P>
<P>2. Some indeed do suppose them to have a real Existence, but to have pecu∣liar
and proper Courses of their own. And that after a certain time, the same
Comets return again, and appear to us: <HI>Quidam aiunt, esse quidem, sed habere
cursus suos &amp; post certa Lustra in conspectum mortalium exire.</HI></P>
<P>3. Some do also suppose them to have a real Being, but not such a durable
one as may deserve the name of a Star, but of such a substance as does wast,
and is dispersed and consumed after a certain time; namely, The time they
appear which is but short. <HI>Quidam, esse quidem, sed non quibus siderum nomen
imponas quia dilabuntur, nec diu durant &amp; exigui temporis mora dissipantur.</HI></P>
<P>So that the first of these Opinions did seem to suppose that they were either
an Union of several small Stars which did really before exist, but being separate,
made no Appearance 'till united; or else that the Rays of these meeting together
in one Point by Repercussion or Reflection, did seem to make this Appearance.
This might well enough agree with the Opinion of the Peripateticks, and those
that supposed the Planets and Stars fixt in solid Orbs, whose Motions carried
them round, and thence possibly they might allude to the Focus of a Burning-Glass,
as if this Appearance were nothing else but the Rays of some Celestial Body, whether
Sun, Planet, or fixed Star, which being collected into one Point, by Reflection,
from the middle parts of the Concave of some of the solid Crystalline Orbs,
might there make a bright Appearance, and then the Tail would be nothing else
but the union of other Rays which fell further from the Middle or Axis of the
Concave, which unite at several Distances from it; or else that some of these
Spheres might have some parts of them of greater Refraction then others, and so
by that Refraction, might collect a great Quantity of Rays diffused from that Lu∣minous
Body which was its cause, as most probably the Sun, as the most con∣siderable
Light of this part of the Universe; and unite the greatest Quantity in
the Head of the Comet, and others in the Tail: And according to these Hypo∣theses,
the Comet would really be nothing else but a Phantasm or Appearance,
and not have any real Existence in Nature, and so would not be much differing
from the appearing Meteors, such as Rainbows. The <HI>Parhelii,</HI> and the <HI>Para∣selenae,</HI>
the Mock-Suns and Mock-Moons, and the like; all which have no
other Existence than the Representation of a Body in a Looking Glass; they be∣ing
indeed nothing but a Reflection or Refraction of those Luminous Bodies
which they represent, or are attributed to. As a Rainbow is nothing else but
the Reflection and Refraction of the Rays of the Sun from the round Drops of
Rain which fall from the Cloud, which at certain Positions to the Eye and Sun,
do by Refraction and Reflection return an extraordinary bright and coloured
Ray to the Eye, which very Drops so soon as ever they are out of that Posture
return not at all; this is Geometrically demonstrated by <HI>Maurolicus, Des Cartes,</HI>
and divers others, and may Experimentally be verified by an artificial Fountain,
casting up and dispersing Water into the Air in a Mist, which will in the Sun∣shine
make a Rainbow. The same may be Geometrically demonstrated of the
<HI>Parhelii</HI> and <HI>Paraselenae.</HI> That all these are nothing but the Phantoms or Ap∣pearances
of some other Luminous Body, made by an extraordinary Collection
and Repercussion of the Rays from some other place, than that Luminous Body
should appear in, and so the Causes of them may be most certainly assigned
and shewn, which being all Atmospherical and Aerial, and placed in the lower
Region near the Earth, they become of no long continuance, but quickly va∣nish.
Now if these Refracting and Reflecting Substances that may be supposed
the cause of the Comets this way, be supposed to be Aetherial Substances, and
so not subject to any suddain Change (as the Atmosphere is) the Cause re∣maining
<PB N="102" REF="136"/>
longer; the Effect also may have a longer Existence, and so a Comet
may be supposed to last six Months or more.</P>
<P>Several have been the Opinions concerning this way, and those very differ∣ing;
some have supposed the Head to be the Point where all these Rays con∣centred
and met together, and there produced a kind of combustive Focus;
through which the Rays of the Sun penetrating, did afterward refract various
ways, and strike forth to a vast length, and from that Penetration of the fiery Fo∣cus
of the Head, acquired such a Quality, as made them to become visible; by
which means, according as this burning Point or Focus did refract more on one
side than on the other; did the Stream or Tail of the Comet appear to bend
from the strait Line continued from the Sun through the middle of this Focus.
This they resembled to the Radiation of the Sun between dark Clouds upon a
thick and foggy Air, which does indeed very much resemble the Appearance of
the Blaze, or rather like the Rays of the Sun let in by one single Hole, or
through a Glass into a dark Room.</P>
<P>I have only this more to add, That if such Reflecting or Refracting Bodies
could be supposed, or that we had any other Argument to prove them than on∣ly
the Appearance of the Comet it felt, there would be some pretty Congruities
in the Theory that would be of some cogency to perswade the Belief of this
Opinion: As, First, That from the Geometrical Laws both of Refraction and
Reflection, this Phantom would have a form much like that of a Comet; that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it would have a Head brighter than the rest, it would have a Tail or Blaze
spreading from it, it would have this Tail always pretty near, opposite to the
Sun; that is, not always directly, but sometimes a little varying from the di∣rect
Line, though it would sometime also be directly opposite; it would some∣time
be strait, but sometime also be bended, sometimes clear, sometimes a lit∣tle
coloured, and the like; which I cannot now stay to insist upon, but may
some other time mote fully explain. And this the rather, because I do not find
that any one that has hitherto written of Comets, has in the least mentioned
any Explication like this; nor does <HI>Seneca</HI> at all explain what the Opinion re∣ally
was: But upon considering of various ways how to solve the Phaenomena,
and how also to explain the Words of <HI>Seneca,</HI> amongst others, I pitch'd on this,
of which I shall upon another Occasion speak more fully, and shew wherein al∣so
the Objections lie against it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hevelius</HI> seems to give another kind of Solution of the Tail or Blaze of
Comets, which though it does,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hevelius's</HI> Opinion examined</NOTE> <HI>toto Caelo,</HI> differ from this I have now explained;
yet it may not improperly be made use of to explain this first Opinion men∣tioned
by <HI>Seneca.</HI> He then supposes that the Tail or Blaze, is really nothing else
but the Rays of the Sun, which in passing through a nebulous Body, such as
he conceives the Head to be, are refracted, and reflected by the <HI>Nucleus</HI> or <HI>Nu∣clei,</HI>
if it have more than one, by which Condensation, Decussation and Col∣lection
of those Rays he supposes the Blaze to be formed; now though, indeed,
he does suppose the Head of the Comet to be a distinct Substance, and so falls
in or agrees with the Third Opinion; yet as to the Tail, he supposes it a meer
Phantom, and to have no real Existence in Nature.</P>
<P>But against this Supposition there are many Objections; as first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This supposition concerning Comet res<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d.</NOTE> though the
Blaze of the Comet does sometime resemble the Radiation of the Sun between
the Clouds, upon a thick Air below those Clouds, as it did in this present
Comet, when the Blaze appeared brightest and longest, yet 'twill be very hard
to make out the Similitude well in a Comet; for these Radiations under the
Clouds appear brighter than the rest of the Air, because all the rest of this thick
Air under them is shadowed and darkned by the interposition of the Clouds,
and those that appear bright, do so, because the Sun shines clearly upon them
between those Clouds. But in the Comet we want, first the Cloud, or some∣what
that should darken the <HI>Aether</HI> round about the Blaze; I say the <HI>Aether,</HI>
because, as I shall afterwards shew, all Comets that have been accurately obser∣ved,
and thence, in probability, all Comets whatsoever have appeared, to be ve∣ry
far removed above the Air, then in probability this dark Body would hinder
the view of some part of the Blaze. Secondly, We find that these Radiations
between the Clouds never happen but when the Air underneath the Clouds is
thick and somewhat opacous, without which they cannot appear; but when
<PB N="103" REF="137"/>
shall we find such an opacous Air to reflect the Light into the Heavens. It
would be much more difficult to suppose such a vast space of the <HI>Aether</HI> to be
thickned (as must necessarily be) to make out this Appearance; than to sup∣pose
only so much Matter as may just serve to make the Bigness of the Blaze it
self, which though it be prodigiously long, as some thousands of the Earths Dia∣meters,
yet still 'tis easier to conceive how there may be matter enough to make a
Cylinder, than to make so vast a Body as an Orb of the <HI>Aether</HI> of that thickness.
But then, Thirdly, There is nothing in the shape of the Head of the Comet
that does any ways resemble the perforation of a Body that should shadow the
rest of the <HI>Aether</HI> about the Blaze. For as I shall afterwards shew you, Comets
do generally appear to have a brighter Body in the middle, about which there
is a kind of White Cloud, from which the Blaze does seem to issue. So that,
in truth, they have no reason at all for this Supposition or Opinion, and it has
in probability sprung, and had its first rise from those who supposed Comets to
be nothing else but some small Appearance here in the Air below: But since, as
I said before, It has been by so many and so exact Astronomical Observations
found, that some of these Comets are very high in the Heavens, and far remo∣ved
beyond the Bounds of the Air, that groundless Opinion may also be dis∣charged,
and yet I find most of our Astronomerrs and Philosophers do incline to
be of that Opinion, as particularly <HI>Des Cartes, Fromundus, Kepler, Cysatus, Riccio∣lus,
Gremaldi</HI> &amp;c. who though they do all assign the real Body to the Comet,
yet as to the Blaze, that they suppose to be made by the transit of the Suns
Rays through the Cloudy part of the Head. And <HI>Hevelius</HI> also, the latest
Writer of Comets, is of this Opinion, not as if it were made by the passing of
the Rays through a Hole, as in a dark Room, but by the Refraction and Col∣lection
of the Rays in the Cloudy, and yet transparent Body or Head of the
Comet. Now this Body or Head he does not suppose Spherical or Globular,
and to collect the Rays of the Sun beyond it into a Focus, as a Glass Globe full
of Water would do; but to be of the form of a Dish or Boat, and to consist of
various sorts of Bodies, some Round, and some Angular, which do variously
Reflect and Refract the Rays of the Sun, and so make them unite and cross
each other in various Ways on that side of the Comet which is opposite to the
Sun, but because he could not well conceive how these Rays should come to be
conspicuous, unless there were some opacous reflecting Body behind the Comet,
as there is in the Air when the Radiations before mentioned are seen below the
Clouds, therefore he has supposed a vast Collection of Vapours or halituous
Substances, proceeding partly from the Sun, and partly from the rest of the
Planets, as ♄, ♃, ♂, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to be made beyond the Body of the Comet, that is
on that side that is opposite to the Sun, and these he supposes to be very much
more thin than the Air or Atmosphere about the Earth; and therefore, that a
little quantity of Matter will go a great way in that Collection: Upon this ha∣lituous
Matter the Radiations falling, he supposes, are Reflected, and so the ap∣pearance
of the Blaze is generated. <HI>Kepler</HI> was aware that there was a neces∣sity
of such a kind of halituous Substance as this mentioned by <HI>Hevelius;</HI> but
yet, considering the vast extent of the Blaze of some Comets, namely, to 40,
50, 60, nay 90; and if we may believe—to 110 Degrees in length; and
that this Angle must be subtended by the Tail, as a strait Line, which in some
Cafes will run it out to a vaster length than if it were only a Circular Extent,
he could not conceive whence all that matter should be brought. But <HI>Hevelius</HI>
has found out whence to fetch it; namely, from the Orbs and Bodies of the
Planets; for since, says he, we are assured, <HI>Quod tam immensa materiarum Con∣geries,
umbrarum scilicet primariarum circa maculas &amp; circa ipsum Solem secun∣dariarum
in longe adhuc majori quantitate quando{que} reperiatur, uti{que} non absur∣dum
quo{que} est ctiam tales expirationes tenuiores etiam circa Cometas dari, Nam
dum non raro pene omnium Planetarum Orbes trajiciunt, multum ubi{que} materiae at∣trahunt
averrunt{que} secum, adeo ut brevissimo temporis Spatio cum motu velocissimo
gaudent vastissimum subtilissimarum istarum exhalationum cumulum, ad eaudam re∣fringendam
convenientem coacervare possint.</HI> But to this Opinion of his, it may be
objected, that, first, as to the Collection of halituous Substances, if such were
made in its Passage then in probabiliy this would be in that part of it which came
behind it in its Motion, and so consequently the Tail should always appear in that
Line which the Comet has past; as we may often observe in the small Meteors to
<PB N="104" REF="138"/>
be seen in a clear Night called Star-shootings, many of which do leave a kind
of Glade of Light behind them in the way through which they have past. So
he gives no manner of Reason why it Should be opposite to the Sun, nor indeed is
his Explication at all natural, but altogether forced, and Extraneous from any
other Method or Operation in Nature, nor is it built upon the Appearances,
for as I shall afterwards shew, had he well heeded those, they would have
hinted some other ways of explicating these <HI>Phaenomena.</HI></P>
<P>I should have here left this Opinion; but that I was this Week informed from
<HI>France</HI> of a Person <HI>D. Anthelme,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Anthelme's</HI> Opinion ex∣amined.</NOTE> a <HI>Carthusian</HI> of <HI>Dijon,</HI> who pretends to have
a true Theory of Comets, and to be able to predict them; and accordingly hath
put out an Ephemerides of this present Comet, therein not only setting down
what he had observed before the Publication, but what should happen after∣wards
'till the time of its disappearing. This Man I mention not for his pre∣dicting
of the Way and Motion of the Comet, for that I think may be much
more exactly done than what he has, by the way I have published in my <HI>Come∣ta,</HI>
which was invented by Sir <HI>Christopher Wren;</HI> by which, from any four Ob∣servations
truly made, one may certainly find the Line, Distance, Motion, Inclina∣tion
to the Ecliptick, its place among the fixt Stars, the length of its Tail, Bright∣ness,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> so long as it shall appear to the naked Eye; for so long that Theory
will hold pretty near; I do not therefore mention this <HI>French</HI> Author for that,
but to shew that he that is far out of the way in his Conjectures about the
form of the Comet, which he supposes also to be made by the Refraction of the
Sun's Rays, the Opinion we have now exploded, and shall hereafter more de∣monstratively
confute from undeniable Arguments; this Man, in probability, is
as much out in his Theory, which is only this, that the Head or Body of the
Comet is Transparent, and that the Tail is made by the Refraction of the Sun∣beams
through it, but does not seem to have considered the Difficulty which
<HI>Kepler, Hevelius,</HI> and divers others had taken notice of, and provided for in
this Hypothesis.</P>
<P>I could relate to you the Opinions of many other Authors who have inclined
to this Opinion, that the Blaze of the Comet is nothing but a Phantom or Ap∣pearance,
but that as I find the very best of them that have imbraced this Opi∣nion,
to have been very dark and perplexed in their Explications; and as if they
had not well understood it themselves, so there are others who only give a bare
Assertion without any Explication or Reason at all: The Authority of such Men,
I confess, weighs very little with me.</P>
<P>I shall therefore pass on to the second sort of Opinions, and that was of such
as supposed them to be Aerial, Halituous and Sulphureous Bodies placed some∣where
in or near the Atmosphere, which was raised out of the Earth, and fired
in the upper Regions of the Air, and there continued 'till they wasted away. Of
this Opinion was the great Philosoher <HI>Aristotle,</HI> and almost all his Followers;
nay many of them, to this Day, who have not taken the Pains to be better in∣structed.
Of this Opinion we find generally ail the Stoicks, but that they sup∣pose
them elevated from the Air into the <HI>Aether;</HI> also the <HI>Chaldeans</HI> and all
Historians, who have mentioned Comets in their Political History: Of this O∣pinion
are almost all the Illiterate and Ignorant People of the World, and al∣most
ever have been, and ever will be; because they are for the most part ru∣led
by the most obvious Appearance to the Sense, without taking Pains to make
use of their Reason to examine things strictly; so that if the majority of Votes
be an Argument for the Truth of any Opinion, certainly this will carry it from
all the rest, at least a Hundred Thousand to One. And yet, after all this, <HI>Ari∣stotle,</HI>
his Commentators, his Followers, the greatest number of Scholars, and
particularly the Stoick Philosophers, as well as Peripatetick, the Historians, Di∣vines,
many Physitians, and all the Illiterate <HI>Vulgus</HI> in the World, will be
found quite mistaken in their Opinion, and will easily be confuted by the Astro∣nomers
and modern Philosophers, who have clearly and plainly demonstrated
their Mistake and Error. And that is, by undeniably proving the vast distance
those Bodies are removed from the Earth by the Parallax, or rather want of
Parallax, which they have been of later Ages certainly observed to have; for
that does most certainly and infallibly shew that they are so far from being
Aerial or Atmospherical, as <HI>Aristotle</HI> seems to suppose, that they are seldom,
<PB N="105" REF="139"/>
if ever so low as the Moon, many times as far off as the Sun, and sometimes
perhaps much farther; I say perhaps, because the Evidence for that is not as
yet so easily attainable, for no one has yet certainly proved the Parallax of the
Sun, nor of <HI>Mars</HI> to any exactness; much less have they of the superior Bodies.</P>
<P><HI>Johannes Regiomontanus,</HI> was the first among the Moderns, who began to ele∣vate
the Positions of Comets above the Air or Atmosphere; for by his Obser∣vations
of that which appeared in the Year 1472, he found it by its Parallax, di∣stant
eight Semidiameters of the Earth at least, which is very far above the
reach of the Air, which those, that with any probabilty judge of its Altitude, at
most make, not above Twenty Miles Perpendicular, but in all probability is yet
much less. But <HI>Ticho Brahe,</HI> and at the same time <HI>Rothmannus</HI> Mathematical
Professor to the <HI>Landgrave of Hassia, Michael Mestline, Cornelius Gemma,
Maddeus Heggetius,</HI> and many others (too many to be named at present) who
had made Observations of the Comets that appeared in the Years, 1577, 1580,
1585, 1590, 1593. did all clearly find and prove that they had all of them
less Parallax than the Moon, and consequently that they must be far above it;
and with them agree almost all the Learned Astronomers since, only <HI>Galileo</HI>
would seem to make it only a Phantom somewhat like a <HI>Halo,</HI> which changed
Its place according to the Position of the Eye that saw it, and thence would
give a Reason why it could have no Parallax; for since its being or Position
depended only upon the Refraction and Reflection of the Sun's Rays; according
to him, its Distance or Angle with the Sun would appear the same where-ever
the Eye were placed to time it; and, consequently, it would observe and keep
the same Position amongst the fixt Stars in the Zenith, as in the Horizon; sup∣posing
it elevated so far only above the Earth, or at least, so posited, as not to
fall in its Shadow. But this Explication of this great Wit, and most excellent
Philosopher and Mathematician <HI>Galileo,</HI> though it be very subtil and curious,
and has some seeming probability, yet the strict Examination of the Appear∣ances
by the known Laws of Refraction and Reflection, will sufficiently shew
the Insufficiency of that Solution; and should the Examination of those not
have been sufficient to have confuted this Supposition from the endeavouring to
solve the common Appearances of Comets to the Naked Eye; yet the Impos∣sibility
to have solved the Appearances of them through the Telescope would
have sufficiently confuted it. But setting him aside, all the considerable Astro∣nomers
who have since written of Comets, do conclude them not to be Sublu∣nary,
but far removed above the Moon, and Aethereal. Such were almost all
those who writ of that great and very bright Comet which appeared to the
World in the Year 1618. And such are those that have writ of Comets that
have appeared since; and more particularly, of those two great ones which
appeared in the End of 1664, and in the beginning of the Year <HI>1665.</HI> Many
of which are comprised in the <HI>Theatrum Cometicum,</HI> Printed in the Year 1667.</P>
<P>This is then the Third Opinion mentioned by <HI>Sencca,</HI> as the second to be held
by divers of the Antients. Namely, That Comets were Aethereal Bodies, placed
at a great Distance from the Earth, and there moved according to Rules pecu∣liar
to them only, and distinct from the fixt Stars, and constantly appearing
Planets.</P>
<P>What Arguments the Antients had to make them of this Opinion, does not
appear any more, than it doth why they held divers others; many of which have
been with great Applause, and very good Reason taken up, and received by
many of our late Philosophers: But certain it is, 'twas not without some very
good Grounds; otherwise, 'tis not to be conceived how they should be able to
hit upon them: As, Particularly that of <HI>Aristarchus Samius</HI> or <HI>Philolaus,</HI> who
Asserted the Sun to be the Center of the Universe; and that all the Planets,
and the Earth among the rest, which must therefore be esteemed one of them,
moved round about it, that remaining fixt. Which Opinion was received by
<HI>Copernicus,</HI> and has been since followed by the most knowing Astronomers.
'Tis not therefore to be doubted, but that the Antients might have some of the
same Reasonings for them that we now have; and possibly many other, which
length of time has devoured; and 'tis not Improbable what <HI>Simon Steven</HI> has
indeavoured to prove, and the learned <HI>Hugo Grotius</HI> has helped him to many
Arguments for it; that there was before any of the Histories now extant, of
<PB N="106" REF="140"/>
Prophane Writers, a learned Age and Place of the World far exceeding that
of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> or <HI>Greece;</HI> of which we have no manner of History conveyed down
to us, but some few scraps and hints here and there scattered up and down in
some of the Writings of the Antients. 'Tis not improbable, but some succeed∣ing
Ages and Sects of Men might industriously destroy them (which was no
difficult thing to do before Printing was in use) as 'tis said of <HI>Aristotle.</HI> But
whatever was the cause, is uncertain; It is therefore much easier to find out the
Truth by new Inquiry into the Nature of the Things themselves, than to hunt
for the Causes of' things among the Worm-eaten Volumes of Antiquity. We
shall therefore pass over the several Branches of Opinions under this Head, of
the Aethereal Nature of the Comets, and come to the various Opinions that
have been asserted and defended by the Moderns, whose Grounds and Reasons
we may easily know.</P>
<P>There are then under this Head, great variety of Opinions, as to the Sub∣stance,
Light, Magnitude, Distance, Motion, Duration, Generation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of
Celestial Comets. But they may be reduced to these.</P>
<P>The first was, That Comets were certain Planets or wandering Stars, the
Laws or Rules of whole Motions were not yet known, and which were distant
from the Seven Planets that were known. Of this Opinion were the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI>
as also <HI>Democritus.</HI> And that thereupon, why they did but sometimes only ap∣pear,
and then vanish, was by reason of their Approaching and Receding from
the Earth in their proper Course, or by reason of their nearness to the Sun.
<HI>Plutarch,</HI> also, says, that some of the <HI>Pythagoreans</HI> also, were of that Opini∣on:
<HI>Seneca,</HI> also, held the same.</P>
<P>The second Opinion is, That the Body and Tail of the the Comet is made up
only by the conflux of many small, and, before, imperceptible Stars; and that
the Reason of their disappearing is, because those Stars are again dispersed.</P>
<P>The Third Opinion is, that the Comets are made <HI>De novo,</HI> out of the <HI>Mate∣ria
Coelestis.</HI> Every of these are varied by several Suppositions about the Blaze,
of which more hereafter.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Here our Author breaks off, and leaves this Discourse of Comets imper∣fect,
so that I was in some doubt whether I should publish it; but considering it
contained a brief Explication of several Opinions of the Antients, and some of the
Moderns, of the Nature of Comets; I thought it might not be unacceptable to the
Reader. I shall in some following Sheets present you with a pretty large Treatise
of Comets; containing his own Theory and Explication thereof, from Observations
made on those in 1680, and 1681.</P>

his former Inquiries into the Nature thereof. <HI>R, W.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<Q>1. A Recapitulation of some former Particulars, as to the Three Properties
of Light, <HI>viz.</HI> its incomprehensible Extension, prodigious Swiftness of its
Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, and yet the Limitation of its Power, so as to admit the Rules of
Comparison, of Majority, Minority and Equality. Light falls under a
threefold Consideration, as it is in the Luminous Body, as it is in the
Medium, as it is in the Eye. Luminous Bodies are Celestial or Terrestri∣al;
Celestial are such as shine by their own Light, as the Sun, and fixt
Stars or Comets, all which are actual Fires: The Authors Theory of Comets,
That the Planets except the Sun have no Light of their own. 2. The
consideration of Bodies within our reach emitting Light, which are reduced
to five Classes. 1st. All Sulphureous, Resinous and Spirituous Bodies.
Here is ashort Explication of Fire, and the Life of Animals, 2dly, Bo∣dies
not combustible yet that will shine with a certain Degree of Heat.
3dly, Such as shine by an inward Fermentation without Heat, 4thly, Such
as shine by an Impression of Light. 5thly, Such as shine by Motion.
3. These are to be the Guides into the Nature of Light. The Definition
or Description of Light, what it is. The Proof and Confirmation there∣of.
That the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dium</HI> of it is perfectly Dense. <HI>Bulialdus</HI>'s Notion of
Light rejected. That Light is a Corporeal Substance, that it perfectly fills
Extension or Quantity extended every Way, that it is susceptive and
communicative of Motion. 4. The Motion of Light, in the Considerati∣on
of which are observable, The Quantity, Quality and Power thereof.
These explained. The cause of Sound. Heat only an internal Motion of
the Parts: A certain Degree of Heat or of this Internal Motion produces
Light. Light in <HI>objecto,</HI> is a peculiar kind of this internal Motion, and
the Propagation of this Motion is Light in the <HI>Medium. R. W.</HI></Q>
<P>1. I Was the last Term diverted from proceeding with the Explication of
Light I had begun to discourse of in some of my former Lectures, by the
Appearance of the Comet, which seems to give a Light very differing from
those of other Celestial Bodies: I was therefore the more willing upon that
Occasion to discourse on the Light of that Body, having before discoursed of
the Light of the Sun and Stars. But it was with a Design of Resuming the Di∣scourse
of Light in General; for that a clear Understanding and Explication
of it, will very much facilitate the Knowledge and Science of many other ab∣struse
and difficult Operations in Nature. For the doing of which as it ought,
<PB N="108" REF="142"/>
much use must be made of Geometry. And, indeed, without it little can be
done, that will any ways intelligibly inform us concerning it. General and in∣definite
Assertions and Descriptions do but imperfectly inform, and the De∣duction
from such Propositions must be uncertain, and of a dubious Sense; and
defective of Form, because they want the necessary Limits and Boundaries.
Whereas, on the other side, where the Definitions are strict and exact, and the
Deductions close and necessary, the Science thence derived is Positive and De∣monstrative,
and will admit of no manner of Hesitancy, or Contradiction.</P>
<P>The Proprieties I have taken notice of were,</P>
<P>1. The Incomprehensible Extension of its Propagation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Recapitulation of the Three Prop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ieties of Light.</NOTE> boundless and unli∣mited
as the Universe, and yet really affecting every Attom or Point of the
Medium or Mass of Created Body, and this not only of the transparent Medi∣um,
but as I conceive, and shall hereafter explain and shew my Reasons for it,
even every Atom and Point of Opacous Bodies also; se that no one Atom
or Particle of created Body is free from its Power; and be the Extent thereof
never so Immense (as whose Imagination can set Limits to Extension) yet the
whole, and every part thereof is really affected by the Power of Light.</P>
<P>Secondly, The prodigious Swiftness, or rather Instantaneousness of this Pro∣pagation;
so that it seems to exert its Power to all imaginable Distance in an
Instant of time; so that at the same Instant that the Lucid Body emits its
Light, or exerts it Power, the Receptive Body though never so far distant is af∣fected
by it; and this without any respect to the vast space interposed, so that
a Body a Million of Millions of Miles distant, is affected as soon as a Body di∣stant
but a Span, so that it may be said to outpass the quickness of our
Thought; for that we must think of one thing after another. And though
some ingenious Men, as Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ier <HI>Romer</HI> have indeavoured to prove it to be
temporaneous, and to spend some time in passing from the Illuminating to the
Illuminated Body, thereby thinking to make it more Intelligible and Adequate
to other Powers and Operations of the Universe; yet he supposing that time to
be so incredibly short, in comparison to the length of the Space it passes, as he
allows but one single second of time, or the sixtyth part of a Minute of an
Hour for the time in which it passes the Distance of about 20000 Miles; is
makes it much more difficult to conceive so rapid a temporaneous Motion,
than the Instantaneousness of that other. For the Motion of a Cannon Bullet
is as much flower than this of Light, as the Motion of a Snail is than that of
a Cannon Bullet.</P>
<P>The Third Propriety of Light which I took notice of, was, that though its
Expansion seems to be indefinite, and its Motion Instantaneous, or infinitely
swift; yet that its Power was finite, and limited and subjected to the Laws
of Quantity, and admitted of the Rules of Comparison, of Majority, of Minori∣ty,
and Equality, which nothing that is infinite is subjected to; and upon this
Account it is, that it falls under the Consideration of Geometry.</P>
<P>1. I shall now begin with a more particular Consideration of Light; and
therein I shall consider what Light is, that has these admirable Proprieties-Reserving
the explication of several other Proprieties of it altogether as won,
derful, 'till I have a little further explained these, and shewn how these are produced by it.</P>
<P>Light then will fall under a Threefold Consideration; First, As it is in the
Luminous Body. Secondly, As it is in the <HI>Medium</HI> that conveys it. And,
Thirdly, As it affects the Eye, by means of which, we come to the Knowledge
of all the rest.</P>
<P>The Luminous Objects are either Celestial or Terrestrial▪<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Three-fold Consideration of Light.</NOTE> of each of which,
there are some that shine by their own Light, and some that shine by Light re∣flected
from them, but derived from another Luminous Body.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="143"/>
The Principal of the Celestial (at least as to us) is the Sün,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Celestial Lumi∣nous Objects.</NOTE> which for ought
we yet certainly know, is the Principal and Brightest Body in the World. I have
already explained somewhat of the Nature of that Body as to its bigness, its
turbinated Motion, its Atmosphere, its <HI>Nebulae, Macuiae</HI> and <HI>Faculae,</HI> and their
Proprieties and Motions, and thence gave some probable Conjecture of the Con∣stitution
and Substance of i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and concerning the manner how it comes to give
Light; and I shew'd you many Reasons why, in all likelyhood, the Light of the
Sun might proceed from an actual Fire, somewhat Analogous to the Fire of Bo∣dies
burning with us; whence from an understanding of the Nature of Fire,
Flame and Light here within our Reach and Command, we might the better
be inabled to examine and judge of the nature of Light in general; for if the Ce∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estial
Lights are Analogous, and much of the same Nature with the Bodies that
give Light with us, then the Knowledge of the one will explain the other.</P>
<P>Next, I began to shew some Reasons why in Probability the sixt Stars were
of the same Nature with the Sun, as to this Propriety of Emitting Light: For,
that first, they were Bodies some of them vastly Distant, as I have, I think,
experimentally proved by the Observation I made of the passing of Stars near
the <HI>Zenith;</HI> and consequently they must be vastly big. Thence, Thirdly, They
must emit a very strong and vivid Light, since at so vast a Distance they do so
sensibly almost Dazle the Eye; for the Power of Light, as I shew'd before,
though it be instantaneous and indefinite in Extension, doth yet continually Di∣minish
in its Power, the farther it acts from the Lucid Fountain; and this not
in a Simple but Duplicate Proportion to the Distance; so that a Body a Hundred
times further Distant, receives not a 10000 Part of the Light. But then,
Secondly, 'Tis probable, that they are actual Fires, as I indeavoured to prove
the same, from some remarkable Instances we have had of some of them that
have, as it were, blazed out upon a suddain, and after a short space, quite
burnt out, so as never to appear since; as that remarkable Star in 1572, which
was so accurately observed by the Noble <HI>Ticho Brahe,</HI> and some others of that
Nature; and by some others, which sometimes appear, and sometimes disap∣pear
again, as that in <HI>Collo Ceti.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, I shew'd why also Comets were Bodies that shined by their own
Light, and did not receive their Light from the Sun, but from a Principle of
their own; and this I have shewn to be very much of the same Nature with our
Fire. And by very many Observations I have made of the last Great Comet, I
am confirmed that the Light of that vastly great Blaze, which at sometimes
was extended to so great a length, as to subtend an Angle of almost Ninty De∣grees,
and to be of the breadth of near Three; was wholly from it self, and
was not caused by the Reflections of the Light of the <HI>Sun;</HI> and that all that
Stream issued from the Body or Head, must after the same manner, as the
flame of a Candle does issue from the Weik; and therefore from all Circum∣stances
I could observe of it, and from what I took notice of in the former
Comets; I judge it to be a Body actually on Fire, or in a State of Dissolution,
and that it consists of burning Materials, but much differing from the Substance
of the Sun and fixt Stars, which afford a more pure, strong and defecated Light,
whereas this is more blended with a kind of Smoke, or Hetrogeneous Vapours,
which are consumed whilst they are in the Blaze, in the same manner, as the
Smoke of a burning Body here with us is consumed by the kindling of it into
Flame, as it ascends from the smoaking or steaming Body; as may be observ∣ed
in the Burning of a Tallow or Wax Candle, or of Oyi, Spirit of Wine, or
the like in a Lamp. These therefore are the Celestial Bodies that emit Light
of their own; in all which, the Original or Cause of it seems to be nothing
else but an actual Fire, and to be Analogous, or very much of kin to the Fires,
that consume Terrestrial Bodies, and therefore our Inquiry for the cause of Light
is brought somewhat nearer to us, and more within our reach, and therefore we
may with the greater Ease and Certainty find out the true Cause and Nature of it.</P>
<P>For as to all the other Celestial Bodies, <HI>viz.</HI> the Moon, and the rest of the
primary and secundary Planets, 'tis very evident that they do not shine by their
own proper Light, but by the help of that of the Sun, which is reflected from
<PB N="110" REF="144"/>
them to us. For if we consider the Moon, 'tis very evident not only from the
Increase and Decrease of Light, which make the Appearances and Phases of
the Increasing and Decreasing of the Moon, and from the Eclipses both of the
Sun and Moon, which have very long been Observed and Explained by this
Theory, the Dark Body of the Moon eclipsing the Sun, and the Interposition
of the Earth between the Sun and the Moon, eclipsing the Moon; but from the
very Shadows of the Protuberant and Craggy Parts of the Moon upon the
Surface of its Body; for those Shadows may, with a Telescope, be as plainly
seen as the Shadow of the Stile of a Dial, and the Motion and Change thereof
may be as plainly also seen, and the Progress of the Light of the Sun upon the
Sursace of that Body. But whereas some object that the secundary and faint
Light of the Moon, which is sometimes remarkable in total Eclipses, seems to
be a proper Light of the Body it self, 'tis now evident enough that, as <HI>Kepler</HI>
well observed, that Light proceeds from the Refractions of the Sun's Light in
the Atmosphere about the Earth, where it is refracted towards the <HI>Axis</HI> of the
<HI>Umbra</HI> of the Earth; and as for that of the New Moon, that is caused by the Re∣flection
of the Sun's Light from the Surface of the Earth; for that 'tis very
plain, that as the Light of that Decreases, as it does when the Aspect is chang∣ed,
and a less part of the inlightned Surface of the Earth reflects to the Moon,
as from the first to the last Quadrature, that secundary or faint Light vanishes
and is no more visible.</P>
<P>Next, As to the Light of the other Planets, 'tis very clear that they Receive
what they Reflect, from the Sun; for 'tis plain, that <HI>Mercury,</HI> when it has
passed between us and the <HI>Sun,</HI> has appeared a small Dark Spot, and some have
affirmed to have seen the Phase of it through a Telescope, to appear Horned like
a New Moon, though I never yet observed it so my self. But as for <HI>Venus,</HI> I
have very often observed the Changes in her, and found her as sharp as the
Moon, two days before or after the Conjunction, without the least Appearance
of Light on the other part of her Body; and <HI>Mars</HI> I have observed a little
wained, but as for <HI>Jupiter,</HI> I have divers times plainly seen the Shadow of
one of the <HI>Satellites</HI> pass over its Disk, as well as the <HI>Satellites</HI> eclipsed by the
Shadow of the Body of <HI>Jupiter;</HI> so that both the Body of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and the <HI>Sa∣tellites</HI>
about it, do shine only from the Reflection of the Light of the <HI>Sun.</HI>
We have no reason to doubt but that the Light of <HI>Saturn</HI> and its <HI>Satellites</HI> pro∣ceed
from the same Cause, and that because as the Body of <HI>Saturn</HI> is so much
further removed both from the <HI>Sun</HI> and us, so the Light is considerably more
Dull and Weak. And besides, I have several times plainly seen the Shadow of
the Ring upon <HI>Saturn,</HI> which could not be, if the cause of its Light did not pro∣ceed
from the <HI>Sun.</HI> So that upon the whole, we have sufficient Grounds to
conclude that the Light of all the Planets proceeds from the Light of the Sun
reflected from them to us; and consequently, that the emitted Light of all Ce∣lestial
Bodies is much of the Nature of the Lights of the Fires we have here up∣on
the Earth.</P>
<P>2. We come then in the nest place to consider such Bodies as are within our
reach,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Terrestrial Lu∣minous Objects.</NOTE> that emit a Light of their own; that so by a Scrutiny of them we may
find out the Cause and Reason of Light.</P>
<P>Of these we have a vast Number of all Bodies almost, by some means or
other affording us Instances of this Luciferous Nature, but they may all be re∣duced
to a few general Classes or Heads, under which Classes they may beeasi∣ly
ranged in some respect or other.</P>
<P>The First and Principal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Sulphureous Bodies, &amp;c.</NOTE> and the most general of all the rest, and which may
most properly be said, of such Bodies as emit their own Light, or to produce
Light from themselves, are all Sulphureous, Unctuous, Resinous or Spirituous
Bodies, which will being first heated, be burnt or Dissolved by the Air, as a
<HI>Menstruum;</HI> for all such Bodies, whilst they are thus Dissolved or Burnt, emit a
considerable Light.</P>
<P>This Head therefore comprises all combustible Bodies, which are either Mi∣neral,
as <HI>Sulphur, Cole, Asphaltum, Bitumen, Petroleum,</HI> and the like; or Ve∣getable;
<PB N="111" REF="145"/>
almost all Parts of which, except the Watry, are Combustible and Di∣ssoluble
by the Air.</P>
<P>Or, Thirdly, Animal Substances; all the Oily or Fatty<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Parts of which are
likewise Combustible, but the Watery and Earthy Parts are not.</P>
<P>Now all these Substances being first heated to a certain Degree, some more,
some less, will by the Air be preyed upon and dissolved, in which Action of
Dissolution or Burning, Light is produced: And 'tis very evident that that Acti∣on
is necessary to the effect of Light, for that before the Consumption or Disso∣lution
begins, and after it is finished, there is no Light produced, but only du∣ring
the time of the Dissolution. And this may be farther argued from this,
that the faster and quicker the Dissolution is made, the more strong and vivid
is the Light; and the flower; the more weak and languid; and therefore, the
more of the <HI>Menstruum</HI> of the Air is applied to the Dissolving Body, the more
quick is the Dissolution performed, and the brighter is the Light, as is well
known in the blowing of Fire with Bellows, whereby a quick supply of fresh
Air, is brought to the burning Body, which is sufficiently known to all Peo∣ple,
though not under this Notion: Most People suppose it to be only for blow∣ing
away the Ashes, and so by that means shewing or discovering the Fire that
lies underneath them; but I have proved by divers Trials, that 'tis not the Mot∣ion
of the Air by the Bellows, for removing the Ashes or driving off the burn∣ing
Parts that does any thing in this Effect; because if the Air that is so blown
he first satiated and then blown on it, it produces no other effect than to blow
off the Ashes, and blow out the Fire; for the more you blow the more dead
is the Light, and the sooner is the Fire quite extinct; insomuch that in a very
short time the Coles all become perfectly Black, without emitting the least
glimpse of Light or Shining, at which time if one blast of fresh Air be blown up∣on
those seemingly dead extinct and black Coles, they all immediately begin
to Glow, Burn, and Shine afresh, as if they had not been at all extinct; and
the more fresh Air is blowed upon them, the more they shine, and the sooner
are they Burnt out and Consumed. So that 'tis the fresh Air that is the Life of
the Fire, and without a Constant supply of that it will go out and Die.</P>
<P>Somewhat like this is observable in the Life of Animals, who live no longer
than they have a constant supply of fresh Air to breath, and, as it were,
blow the Fire of Life; for so soon as that supply is wanting, the Fire goes out;
and the Animal dies, and all the other vital Functions cease; as any one may
presently see, if he puts a small Animal as a Bird, or the like, into a small Glass
and covers it close; for in a short time the Air becomes satiated, and is no
longer fit for Respiration; but though the Animal breath it as before, and Pant
and move his Lungs as before; yet if the Air be not fresh, the Fire of Life will
extinguish. Some Learned Philosophers and Physitians have been of the Opini∣on,
that the use of Breathing was for nothing else, but that by the Motion of the
Lungs the Blood might be kept circulating which past through them, or
that the Steams of the Blood might be carried off, which it could not do when
it was full of Steams; but by many Trials I have proved that neither of those
are at all the Cause of the Death of the Creature, but only the w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt of
fresh Air.</P>
<P>For whether the Lungs move or not move, if fresh Air be supplied, the Ani∣mal
lives, if it be wanting, it dies. Again, If the Air be full of Steams or not
full of Steams, it is all one, the Animal lives if it be fresh, but if it be not, it
dies; nor does the heat or Cold of it do any thing. But this only by the by, be∣ing
more proper to another Time and Discourse; my present Inquiry being af∣ter
the Nature and Cause of Light. This then is one of the Classes of shining
Bodies; namely, such as are Dissoluble or Burnable by the Air.</P>
<P>The next Class are all such Bodies as are not combustible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Shining B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣dies not Com∣bustible, but heated</NOTE> but are so fixt
as to indure a great degree of Heat, without being subject to flie away or be
dispersed into Vapours; such are all sorts of Metals, Stones, Earths, Clays,
Salts, Sands, White Burnt Bones, Ashes of Vegetable and Animal Substances,
and the like; Every one of which when heated to a certain Degree of Heat, will
Shine or afford Light; but under a certain Degree will not shine at all.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="146"/>
Now there are great Varieties of these Degrees, for that some will not begin to
shine till, 'they have a very intense and violent Heat, others, with a small De∣gree,
insomuch that I lately saw the Pouder of a Stone which laid upon a
Plate of Metal, and held over a Chafingdish of Coles, would presently, and
with a small Heat begin to shine, but so soon as the Plate cooled, would leave
off shining, but the Plate being warmed again, it would again shine; and al∣most
every Body has a peculiar Degree of Heat, at which it begins its shining;
so that there are almost as many Varieties of Degrees of Heat to make Bodies
shine, as there are to make Bodies flow and melt; some will shine before they
melt, as almost all the harder Bodies; as Gold, Silver, Copper, Brass, Iron,
Stones, Earths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> others will Melt before they Shine, as Tin, Lead, Salt peter,
Allum, Vitriol, Tallow, Gums, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the Third Class are all such Bodies as shine without Hear, by an inward
Fermentation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3. Bodies shining without Heat.</NOTE> in which though their Light be but small, yet does it become visi∣ble
enough in a darkned Room or in the Night; such are Glow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>worms, <HI>Scolo∣pendra,</HI>
several kind of Flies, decaying Fish, as Whitings, Oysters, and many
others, sometimes Flesh, as Veal; also rotten Wood, and some sorts of Putri∣fying
Vegetables, also some Putrifying Urines; also the <HI>Phosphorus</HI> made out of
the <HI>Caput Mortuum,</HI> or the Rob of Urine found out by Dr. <HI>Kunkell,</HI> and many
others.</P>
<P>In the Fourth Class are such as shine by the Impression of Light made upon
them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4. Bodies shin∣ing by an Im∣pression of Light.</NOTE> by being exposed only to the Light of the Sun or the Day. Such are
the Preparation of the <HI>Bononian stone,</HI> and the Preparation lately found out of
common Chalk by Dr. <HI>Baldwin;</HI> these receive such a Power from the Influence
of the Light, that being carried into a Dark Room after they have been expo∣sed
to the Light, they then appear to shine like a Cole of Fire, and continue
so to do for a pretty-while, but will by degrees lose their Light, and be ex∣tinct
almost in the manner as a Piece of Red hot Iron; but being again exposed
to the Light of the Sun, or a Window, they presently reassume their shining
Quality.</P>
<P>In the Fifth Class are all such as shine by Motion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5. Bodies shi∣ning by Motion.</NOTE> Diamants, Sea Water,
some sort of Dews, Sugar, Black Silk, the Back of a Cat, and clean warmed
Linnen, as has been lately experimented by Dr. <HI>Crone,</HI> and several other Sub∣stances
which will shine with a degree of Motion or a little rubbing.</P>
<P>To this Head also, may be referred several others also which require a great
Degree of Heating or Rubbing, as Iron and some other Metals which may be
made Red Hot, or to shine with Hammering only, two hard Stones as Flints
and the like, struck one against the other, two Pieces of Wood which with
Rubbing will take fire, and the like.</P>
<P>3. These several sorts of Lights are to be the Guides which must conduct us
in our search after the true Nature of Light, nor can the Truth of the Theo∣ry
be fully Discover'd, 'till every one of these Witnesses and Testimonies are
thoroughly examined, and that by comparing the Evidences that each of them
shall bring distinctly, with those of every one of the other, there being such Ax∣ioms
and Maxims founded, as will open a way to the clear Knowledge of this
most abstruse and difficult Science of Light. From which as all the visible Ap∣pearances
derive their Original, so the greatest part of the Knowledge and
Information of Mankind; for the Explication of which, the Theory of Vision,
and the structure of the Eye, the Organ of that Sense, and all the Powers and
Modifications and effects of the Rays of Light: And so the Theory of <HI>Opticks,
Dioptricks, Catoptricks,</HI> Perspective and Projections, and Cromatick, or the
Theory of Position, Modification and Effect of the Rays of Light, whether Di∣rect,
Refracted, or Reflected, of Compounded on the various Superficies on
which they are incident; every of which I design (God Willing) fully to expli∣cate.
So also the Velocity and Modification of all the Motions of the Celestial
Bodies?, <HI>viz.</HI> both the primary and secundary Planets, have their Original and
Cause, as I shall hereafter plainly and fully demonstrate.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="147"/>
It would be too long here to recount to you the whole process of the Exami∣nation
of these Evidences, and the whole proceeding, with those Evidences; by
comparing every one, with every other, singly; and then, many together, with
such a peculiar Number of many others; whereby the Nature and Cause, and
the Characteristick of Light in General is discovered; and then, to discover
what is the peculiar cause of it in this, and that, and t'other particular Body,
from whence it proceeds. It will suffice at this time to tell you the Result and
Conclusion; for that the Process is long and tedious, and not attained but by
many Steps and Degrees. <HI>Light then is nothing else but a peculiar Motion of
the parts of the Luminous Body,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Definition of Light, what it is.</NOTE> <HI>which does affect a fluid Body that incompasses the
Luminous Body, which is perfectly fkyud, and perfectly Dense, so as not to admit of
any farther Condensation; but that the Parts next the Luminous Body being mov∣ed,
the whole Expansum of that fluid is moved likewise.</HI> So that any assignable
Parts next the Luminous body being protruded a certain assignable Space, that
protrudes all the vast <HI>Expansum</HI> of the fluid, every way <HI>in orbem,</HI> at the same
Instant an assignable Space: So that no one Atom, or Point of it, to all ima∣ginable
Distance, but is at the same time moved with it, or protruded for∣ward:
For Instance, When a Luminous Part of the Sun is moved with the
Motion of Light, it does at the same Instant, move the Parts of the Incompas∣sing
fluid, which is the proper <HI>Medium</HI> of Light, with the Motion of Light;
which part cannot so be moved, but that all the Parts of that <HI>Medium,</HI>
to the extent of the World, must be moved at the same Instant, and protruded
from the Luminous Point in a direct Line; so that at the same Instant, that the
<HI>Apex</HI> of the Cone is moved, the spherical base of that Cone also is moved, and
every imaginary Spherical Superficies, that is parallel to that base, is moved like∣wise.</P>
<P>This Consequence will follow of necessity, from the Definition of the Nature
of the <HI>Medium,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Medium of Light is perfe∣ctly Dense.</NOTE> that is proper for the conveyance of Light. And that is, that
it is a <HI>Medium perfectly Dense;</HI> that is, such as will not be by any Power forced
into less Dimensions than it is contained in, but does compleatly fill and main∣tain
that space. And, Secondly, From its <HI>perfect fluidity,</HI> it does accommo∣date
it self to all manner of Forms, so as exactly to shape it self into the new
Form that is given to it, by the Motion of Light.</P>
<P>For Instance, If we imagine A B C to Represent an hollow Conical Body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 5. Plate 1.</NOTE>
Indefinitely extended from the Point A, which is the Apex towards B C, and at
the same time imagine also this hollow Conical Body, fill'd with a Body per∣fectly
fluid, and perfectly Dense; that is, such as will perfectly accommodate
It self to the Figure of that Cone, and intirely fill the Cavity of it, so as not to
leave the least Point of it unfilled; and that will not admit of any manner of
Condensation into a less Room: If then we imagine, that by the first stroke
of the Motion of Light, the Parts of the fluid that fill th Apex <HI>A d n,</HI> be dri∣ven
forward toward the base, into the space <HI>d n e o,</HI> equal to it in quantity;
it must at the same Instant drive that part of the fluid that fill'd the space <HI>d n e o,</HI>
into the space <HI>e o p f,</HI> equal to it in quantity, and that which fill'd the space
<HI>e o p f,</HI> must at the same time be protruded into the space <HI>f p q g,</HI> of the same
quantity; and so onward <HI>f p q g</HI> into <HI>g q r b,</HI> and <HI>g q r h</HI> into <HI>h r si, in Infi∣nitum,</HI>
or to the utmost extent of the Cone, and filling fluid Matter; so that at
the same time that the Parts that made the imaginary Spherical Base, <HI>d n,</HI> of
the Cone <HI>A d n</HI> are moved into the imaginary Spherical Base <HI>e o,</HI> of the Cone
<HI>A e o,</HI> will the imaginary Spherical Superficies, <HI>l u,</HI> of the Cone <HI>A l u</HI> be mo∣ved
into the Place of the imaginary Spherical Base <HI>m x,</HI> of the Cone <HI>A m x,</HI>
though never so far removed from the Apex <HI>A:</HI> So that a Body perfectly dense,
and perfectly fluid, must communicate such a Motion begun, to all imaginable
Distance in an Instant. It being impossible that the Apex of the Cone <HI>A d n</HI> can
be moved into the space <HI>d n o e,</HI> without moving at the same time, every part
of all the rest of such a Cone, to the utmost Extension.</P>
<P>The further consideration then of this Cone, will give us the Reasons, and
Grounds of the three I have already named, and of several other Proprieties of
Light, and make them very intelligible and plain to be understood, and easy to
be demonstrated.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="148"/>
As,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason of the Decrease of the Power of Light.</NOTE> First, From hence we may understand the Reason of the Force and Pow∣er
of Light, at several Distances from the Luminous Body; for according to the
Increase of the imaginary Bases of the parts of the Cones, and according to the
Decrease of the Thickness of the several Parts; so is the Decrease of the Power
of Light at those several Distances. For, First, It is clear that the same Quan∣tity
of Motion, and consequently of Light, that there is is in the first Cone or
Apex <HI>A d n,</HI> the same is there in the last part <HI>l u x m,</HI> and in every other inter∣mediate
Part, as <HI>d n o e, e o p f, f p q g, g q r h,</HI> and the rest; so that if we
compute it first according to the Expansion of the Imaginary Base; we shall
find that those increase in a Duplicate Proportion, that is, as the Squares of the
several Distances, as at ten times the Distance, the Expansion is a Hundred
times the space; and consequently the same quantity of Motion is expanded
into a Hundred times the space, and therefore an equal space of the Superficies
of that, at ten times the Distance, will have but 1/100 Part of the Motion of Light
that is upon the Superficies at once the Distance. This therefore will be repre∣sented
by the Sections of a Conical Body, made by turning the Hyperbola
round upon the Asymtot, for the Ordinates to the Asymtot being in reciprocal
Proportion to the intercepted Parts of the Asymptot, the Squares of Circles of
those Asymptots, must be in Duplicate Proportion of the intercepted Parts of
the Asymptot Reciprocally. This is the Proportion that the ingenious <HI>Kepler,</HI>
allows to the Decrease of Light, supposing it to be only in Duplicate Proporti∣on
of the Distance Reciprocal; and according to this, he founds the Proportion
of the power of the Sun in moving the Planetary Bodies at several Distances;
but he ought to have considered also another Decrease of the Power of the
Light, according to the Decrease of Thickness, of the base Parts of the Cone.
For since in all the Imaginary equal Parts of the Cones, there is the same
quantity of Matter, if the same be Expanded in Breadth, it must be diminish∣ed
in thickness. If therefore at ten Foot Distance, for Instance, it be spread
into a Breadth 100 times as big as at one foot distance, then consequently to make
the equality of Content in the one and the other, there must be but 1/100 part of the thickness.</P>
<P>For if at the Distances—1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Superficies of Bases expanded be as—1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Thickness of those Bases must be as 1, ¼, 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 1/16, 1/25, 1/36, 1/40, 1/66, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>These then will give the Proportions of the length of the Pulses or
strokes of Light, at several distances from the Luminous Body, and con∣sequently
the Velocity of those Pulses. So that according to these Rules, the
Force of Power of Light must decrease in quadruplicate Proportion of the Di∣stances
reciprocally taken; that is, as the squared Squares of the Distances
Reciprocally, and consequently, as I shall afterwards shew the effect of Light,
of the Motion it causes in other Bodies, will be in Subduplicate Proportion of
the Powers, and therefore only in Duplicate Proportion of the Distances Reci∣procally
taken.</P>
<P>So that thence it is evident, that Light does act according to the Proportion
of a Body moved, observing exactly the same Proportions, and therefore can be
nothing else but that; for what Thing soever hath all the same Proprieties with
another, must be the same,</P>
<P>It is not therefore what the Learned and Ingenious <HI>Bulialdus</HI> would have it
to be;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bulialdus'<HI>s</HI> N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tion rejected.</NOTE> namely, a certain Substance which is a Geometrical <HI>Medium,</HI> between
a Body and a Spirit. <HI>Lux est</HI> (says he) <HI>media Proportionalis inter corpoream
substantiam &amp; Incorpoream:</HI> Light is a middle proportional Substance, between
a corporeal Substance, and an incorporeal. A middle proportional (say he)
is that which between two extream Lines, does equally divide the Rationes of
both, and which does participate of the Excesses and Defects, and communi∣cates
the same Habitudes with both; and by how many of its parts it is exceed∣ed
by the Greater, by so many parts of the Less does it exceed that. For In∣stance,
says he, Let <HI>A E</HI> be an incorporeal Substance, and <HI>C</HI> a Corporeal. The
incorporeal Substance <HI>A E,</HI> exceeds the corporeal Substanced <HI>C,</HI> by the Excess
<PB N="115" REF="149"/>
<HI>D E,</HI> to wit, by instantaneous Motion and Penetration of solid Bodies; but
the corporeal Substance <HI>C,</HI> is defective of the Incorporeal by its Termination
and successive Motion. Now we must find a middle proportionate Substance,
which is defective of the Incorporeal, and exceeds the Corporeal, but a middle
proportional does participate of the Excess and Defect. Now <HI>B G</HI> (the Sub∣stance
of Light) is defective of <HI>A E,</HI> in Termination and successive Motion,
but it exceeds <HI>C</HI> in instantaneous Motion and Penetration. Now that Substance
which is defective of one, and exceeds the other, is a Medium, but Light is
such a Substance, which by its Penetration and instantaneous Motion, exceeds a
corporeal Substance; but it is defective of Incorporeal Substance, in its Termi∣nation
and Successive Motion. This is his Demonstration, but how much more
instructed we are by it, of the Nature of Light, I shall leave to every Man to
judge. It is, I confess, above my reach to conceive what Substance 'tis he
should mean; it being perfectly new and not thought of before, that ever I
could meet with; nor can I see what need he had of supposing any such Sub∣stance.
For since the same Proprieties that are found in Light are found in Cor∣poreal
Substances, or Bodies, as I have before mentioned; I see no reason why
on this Account, we have any Reason either to suppose an Incorporeal Sub∣stance,
or a Substance of a middle Nature, between Incorporeal and Corporeal.
'Tis to me, I confess, very difficult to conceive what a Corporeal Substance is;
nor can I have any more clear Conception of what is meant by that Expression,
than what I would express by these two Words; <HI>somewhat extended,</HI> which
how that differs from a <HI>Vacuum,</HI> or an Extension, without Substance, or an
extended Nothing, is not easy to be understood by one that throughly considers
his own Conceptions.</P>
<P><HI>Des Cartes</HI> therefore makes Extension and Body, or corporeal Substance, to
be one and the same thing; and that no other Substance but Body, or Corpore∣al,
can be extended.</P>
<P>But to leave these Metaphysical Notions, 'tis clear from what I have shewn,
that as to this Subject, Light, there is no need of supposing any other Sub∣stance,
but Corporeal, or Body; and that, so and so qualified; that is, perfect∣ly
Fluid, and perfectly Dense, and so Receptive and Communicative, of all
manner of Motion.</P>
<P>As to the Notion therefore of the Substance of Light,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The true Moti∣on of Light.</NOTE> I know not what can
be farther added, that is more known or more Intelligible than that it is; First,
A Substance, or a something; that is infinitely fluid, or at least, indefinitely;
if that be more conceivable, whose least conceivable Part is free from cohesion
with any other, and so is susceptible of any kind of Motion, without carrying
or moving along with it the Lateral Bodies, whereby it only communicates the
Motion it receives behind, to the Parts that lie immediately before it; whence
follows that great Propriety of Light, that in a uniform Medium, it propagates
its Motion every way in direct Lines or Rays, from a Center of a Sphere.</P>
<P>And, Secondly, That it is a Substance,, or something that compleatly fills an
Extension or Quantity every way extended, and cannot be condensed, or forced
into less Extension, Space, or Room, by any Natural Power; but that the
same Substance will always have the same Quantity, or Extension, one
way or other; what it wants in one, it will have in one or both of the other Di∣mensions;
as what it wants in breadth it will have in thickness, or in length,
that shall recompence the whole, and bring it to equality.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That this, as all other Bodies, is susceptive and communicative of all
manner of Motion, but is more appropriated to Motion of such a Degree of
Swiftness, which is in proportion to the Motion of other Bodies, whose least
part is solid and bulky, as the bigness of the one, to the bigness of the other,
Reciprocally taken. This may serve for the Explication of the Substance of Light.</P>
<P>4. The next thing we are to consider, is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Motion of Light.</NOTE> the Motion of Light, which is the
principal thing considerable in it; for the Substance without the Motion has no
effect, nor has the substance Light; 'tis that we are sensible of, and not of the
Substance; so that be the Substance what it will, whether Corporeal, or Incor∣corporeal,
<PB N="116" REF="150"/>
corporeal, or Middle, Proportional, or None; provided we know what the
Motion is, and the Rules, Powers, and Proportions of that, we need not much
consider the Substance of it.</P>
<P>In the Consideration then of Motion these thing are observable;</P>
<P>1. The Quantity.</P>
<P>2. The Quality.</P>
<P>3. The Power.</P>
<P>By the quantity of Motion, I understand only the Degrees of Velocity ex∣istent
in a certain Quantity of Matter.</P>
<P>By the Qualities of Motion, I mean the Modifications of it in Body, as
whether it be Simple or Compound, Reflected, Refracted, Direct or Oblique,
and the like.</P>
<P>By the Power, I mean the Act or Effect it produces upon other Bodies, in
agitating or moving them.</P>
<P>In the Consideration of every one of which, I shall indeavour to reduce the
Theory to Calculation and Mathematical Exactness; without which, all other
ways are but Random Guesses, and make no certain and demonstrative Conclu∣sions.</P>
<P>The Motion produced by the Lucid Particles must be of a certain Degree of
Swiftness; otherwise, it is not propagated in the form of Light, for 'tis not
every Motion that produces that Effect; for 'tis in Light,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sound how caused.</NOTE> as it is in Sound;
that the Motion must be of a certain De∣gree
of Swiftness, before Motion will
be propagated in the Medium that conveys it: we find that moving a Stick in
the Air, if we move it but slowly, we hear no Sound; because the Motion is so
slow, that the Parts of the Air that were before it do easily move round the
Sides of the Stick and come behind it, so that only those Parts of the Air are
moved that lie near the Stick, which do only receive such a circulating Motion
as brings them from before to come behind, the ambient Parts of the Air ha∣ving
Power enough to reflect and keep in that Motion, so as only to circulate
about the Stick; but if the Motion of the Stick be so swist, as that the Particles
before it over power the Resistance of the ambient Air, so that its Motion is
not reflexed backwards, but propagated directly forward into the Air, then Sound
is generated and propagated from the Stick, every way <HI>in orbem;</HI> whence if you
give a very quick Motion to the Stick in the Air, you presently hear a
Noise.</P>
<P>In the same manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A certain De∣gree of Heat produces Light.</NOTE> if you take a piece of the most fixed Body that will in∣dure
the Fire; as for Instance, a piece of pure Gold, or refined Silver, which
will not wast nor burn by heating; if you heat it but with a smaller Degree of
Heat, you will not perceive it to shine or give any kind of Light; but if you
continue to Augment the Heat to a certain Degree it will begin to shine, and
appear Red Hot, as we call it; and if it be heat more, it shines brighter; but
if you take it from the Fire, and permit it to cool, its Light grows fainter and
fainter, and when it is come to a certain Degree of Heat, it ceases to shine at
all, and emits no Light. Now Heat, as I shall afterward prove, is nothing
but the internal Motion of the Particles of Body; and the hotter a Body is,
the more violently are the Particles moved, and with a quick Motion; but the
Particles of Bodies, according as they are more bulky and close, so do they re∣quire
the greater Degrees of Motion, to make them move with an equal Degree
of Motion, with that of smaller Particles; as I shall afterwards prove, when I
come to give the Laws and Rules of Motion propagated from Body to Body.
In the same manner in such Diamants, as will shine like a Gloworm in the Dark,
(for all Diamants will not; but I have seen and tryed many Diamants that
would;) the Stone will not begin to shine 'till it has received a certain Degree
of rubbing and Agitation, but beyond that Degree, the more you rub it the
more it shines, and any little stroke upon it with the Nail of ones Finger, when
it so shines, will make it seem to flash. The like I have lately observed in
the Phosporus of <HI>Kunkell,</HI> that the rubbing it a little with ones Finger, does
make it glow, and as it were flame. So if you take a Piece of Cold Iron, and
<PB N="117" REF="151"/>
hammer it on an Anvil, you must continue hammering it very strong and quick
a go<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d a while, before you will perceive it to begin to shine; but if you continue
to work it with a Hammer for a certain space, it will shine very briskly; and
grow, as we call it, Red Hot. Now in all these Instances, and a Hundred
more I could produce, 'tis evident that there must be a certain Degree of Ham∣mering,
Rubbing, or Heating, before the Body so wrought on will produce
Light: All which do effect an internal Motion of the parts of the bodies so
Hammered, Rubbed, or Heated; 'tis therefore evident, that 'tis not every Mo∣tion
of the Particles of Bodies that will produce Light, but a certain Degree of
it; under which no Light is produced, and beyond which the Light is increased
and augmented.</P>
<P>This kind of internal Motion therefore in the Parts of the Body, is that
which produces Light; whatsoever therefore produces this Motion, produces
Light; whether it be heat, as i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all very fixt Bodys, or Fire, which, as I told
you before, is a Dissolution of the Body by the Air, as in all Unctuous, Re∣sinous,
or Sulphureous Bodies; or Hammering and Strokes, as in Stones, Chry∣stals,
Diamants, Sugar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or Fermentation and Corruption, as in Fish,
Glow-worms, Rotten-Wood; or the Motion of Light it self, as in the Bononi∣an-Stone,
and Dr. <HI>Baldwin</HI>'s Phosphoros, and in almost all other Bodies held in
the Focus of a Burning Glass. Light therefore in the Object, is a peculiar kind
of Internal Motion of the Particles.</P>
<P>The propagation of this Motion into,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Light is in the Me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣um.</NOTE> and through the incompassing Medi∣um
is that we call Light in the Medium, or the space between the Inlightning
and Inlightned Body. This propagation of Motion, as I said before, is every
way <HI>in orbem;</HI> and it may be caused either by an Immediate pulse of the Parti∣cles
of the Body against the Parts of the incompassing Fluid, as a Stone striking
against the Water, from whence the Waves of Motion are there propagated
In Rings; or else by the extrusion of the Part of the Fluid Medium of Light
that lies between the solid Particles of the shining Body; as Water squeezed
out of a Spunge into Water, or Water forced out of a Syringe, or Pipe, into
Water, which will produce the same Rings in the Surface of the Water. It
seems to be in some Cases One way, and in some Cases the other. In burning
Bodies, it seems to be the first way, where every Particle of the Body Dissol∣ved
flies asunder, and is rarifi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d or dispersed into a bigger space, in the manner
as we may observe in the firing of a Grain of Gunpouder, which we see ex∣pands
into a Sphere of Flame, which extrudes and evacuates a Sphere of Air
round about the fired Grain. But in hammered Bodies, and some other I have
named, it seems to be the other.</P>
<P>If we therefore consider what Effects follow in these sensible Examples,
we may the more certainly conclude what must follow in the more in∣sensible.</P>
<P>The Grain of Gunpouder, then, when it is fired, rarifies it self into a Sphere
near a Hundred times as big in Diameter, or one Million times as big in Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>;
this extrudes all the Air that was contained in that Sphere into a Space or Oro
without it, and incompassing it, large enough to contain it; and consequently
must remove the Air that fill'd that space into another space without that, and
that the next, and so onward successively to a certain Distance; 'till at Last the
Medium of the Air being a Springy, Rarified, or Yielding Medium, and not a
Dense and Unyielding Medium, the Motion is at length lost, and so this sound
audible but to a certain Distance. Whereas in the propagation of Light, the
<HI>Medium</HI> being perfectly Dense and Unyielding, that Propagation is continued
<HI>in Infinitum,</HI> or to the utmost extent of the <HI>Medium.</HI> The solidity therefore of
the incompassing Spheres, will be to one another as 1, 2, 3, 4, <HI>&amp;c▪</HI> in Arithme∣metical
Progression; and consequently the Diameters of those Spheres will be as
√ c 1. √ c 2. √ c 3. √ c 4. and so onwards; and consequently if you take the
Diameters of the contained, from the Diameters of the containing, the Remain∣ders
will be the thickness of the containing shell; that is, the √ c <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. will be the
length of the stroke of the Pulse of Light in the first sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce; √ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 2.—√ c 1. the
<PB N="118" REF="152"/>
length of the stroke of that Pulse in the second space; √ c 3.—√ c 2. the length
of the stroke in the third; √ c4.—√ c 3. in the fourth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> so that those in∣definitely
continued, will be very near to a Series of Numbers in the same Pro∣portion,
with the superficies of the Spheres reciprocally taken, and consequent∣ly
the length of the stroke of the Pulse of Light, will be in duplicate Proportion
to the distance reciprocal.</P>
<P>I have been the more particular in the Explication of this Power of Light,
because, as I shall afterwards prove to you, this is the Power of Celestial Bo∣dies
by which they Act upon, and attract each other; and by which all the
Primary Planets that move about the Sun are regulated in Velocities, Distan∣ces
and Motions, whether circular or Oval. As also all the secundary Planets, as
the Moon about the Earth, and the Satellites about <HI>Saturn</HI> and <HI>Jupiter,</HI> make
their Periods. And from the true stating of this Power, and the Effects of it
on Bodies at several Distances, all the Theory of Astronomy will be deduced a
<HI>Priori,</HI> with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eometrical Certainty and Exactness; and consequently the Ta∣bles
and Numbers will be easily adapted, which will tend to the Perfection of
that Noble Science.</P>

<Q>1. Having shewn what Light is in the Luminous Body and <HI>Medium,</HI> the Au∣thor
comes in the third Place to shew the Operations it hath on the Subject;
the chief of which is, that Effect it has on the Eye; to which End he
gives a particular Explication of the Fabrick of this admirable Organ,
in which there are infinite receptive Points within, to receive all the
Rays from the Infinite Points without. Vision is made by reuniting all
the Rays proceeding from one Point of the Object, after they have been
scattered into one Point again. 2. A Second Way of conceiving how
the Eye multiplies the Power that was by the <HI>Hypothesis</HI> before explain∣ed,
<HI>i. e.</HI> that according to the length of the Stroak or Pulse, so is the
Power or Strength of Light. Effects of Burning Glasses explained and
applied to this purpose; that the length of the Pulse at the <HI>Focus</HI> there∣of
is the same with the length of the Pulse at the Sun. 3. The Action
of the Eye much the same with that of a Burning-Glass; so that the im∣pression
on the <HI>Retina</HI> is the same, as if the Action of the Object were
really there. 4. Why the Eye is not hurt by the Object, tho' it, as it
were, feels and touches it: And this is, because it takes in, the <HI>Basis</HI> but
of a very small <HI>Cone</HI> of <HI>Rays</HI> from the radiating Sphere; so that tho'
the Velocity or length of the Pulse be the same, yet there being but few,
their collected Power is less; and this is perform'd by the Contraction
of the <HI>Pupilla;</HI> whence the Eye becomes weakned by bright Objects, and
why we can look on the Sun thro' a very small Hole. 5. The Fabrick
of the Eye and all its parts, as far as relates to Opticks, examined,
and is necessary to the present Design; the more particular Examinati∣on
of the parts, and its Humours, being refer'd to the Nature of Re∣ftraction.
6. An artificial Eye very useful for the thorough Ʋnderstand∣ing
of Vision. The Description and use of a Perspective Box, instead
of a dark Room, which will explicate all the <HI>Phenomena</HI> of Vision as
they are represented in the bottom of the Eye. An Explication of Shadows

<P>I Have in some of my former Lectures in this place, explained to you the
Nature and Proprieties of Light; and shew'd to you what it is in the Lu∣minous
Body from whence it proceeds, and what it is in the Medium, through
which it is propagated: I shew'd you how it came to be propagated every
way <HI>in Orbem,</HI> to all imaginable distance in an Instant, and with what pro∣portion
of Strength it was so propagated to all assignable Distances from the
Lucid Object; and thence I deduced with what Power it operated, and there∣by
produced Effects on those Subjects, on which it was impressed.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="154"/>
The first and Principal of all the Operations it hath on Subjects,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Effect Light has on the Eye.</NOTE> is that effect
which it hath upon the Organ of the seeing Eye, wherein it maketh such an
Impression as becomes sensible to the Animal Faculty. This then is the next
thing I shall indeavour to explain; namely, the Action or Effect of Light upon
the Eye.</P>
<P>For the doing of which, I shall first consider the Fabrick and Make of that
Organ. Secondly, The manner how Light comes to operate upon it.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Explicati∣on of the Eye.</NOTE> For the Fabrick of the Eye, It is in it self so truly admirable, that
there is nothing in the whole Creation better deserves our Contemplation, and
wherein the Wisdom and Design of the Great Creator more sensibly appears;
for as of all created Beings, those which are animated seem to have the great∣est
Contrivance; every thing in each of them seeming to be contrived on pur∣pose,
and with a Design, respecting the end of their being and well-being, and
continuation either in the individual, or in the Species propagated. So among
those animated Bodies, Animals seem to abound with more excellent contri∣vances
than Plants; and of Animals some are yet more curious and perfect
than some others; that is, have more Contrivance and Perfection of Organisa∣tion
and Mechanism than others; though every thing in its kind be furnish'd
with those Faculties which are requisite to perform those Functions which are
necessary to their Preservation. Now of all the Organisations of Animals, none
are more admirable than those of the Senses, and of those, none, that we know,
more wonderful than that of Sight, wherein we shall find every thing so adapt∣ed
for Matter, Form, Situation, Motion, and the like:, that it does far exceed
the Contrivance of the Wit of Man to come near it, even in Imitation. And
yet we find that all things are Consonant and Congruous to our Understanding,
and we cannot chuse but approve and admire the great Wisdom and Contri∣vance
of the Maker, so that we may even from thence clearly and demonstra∣tively
see, that the Reason of Man is a spark of the Divine Influence, and that
whatever is done in this World is adequate to the Principles and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of
Reason implanted in our Understanding and Knowledge; and that all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
are formed and act with Design and Respect to the End, and not fortuitously
and by chance.</P>
<P>For an Instance of this, we cannot in Nature pitch upon a better than the
Fabrick of the Eye, in which we shall find every thing adapted and formed for
that particular part of performing Vision, which is to be performed by it;
and every part has its necessity to make up the perfect Effect, and no one is re∣dundant,
and there is no part defective.</P>
<P>The Radiations of Light I have formerly Explained, are continually Propa∣gated
from every Luminous Object, and from every Point of every Luminous
Object, every way from every one of those Points <HI>in Orbem;</HI> as the Rays from
a Sphere: So that as there are infinite of those radiating Points in the World,
so from every one of those infinite Points there are infinite of those Radiations;
so that the Luminous <HI>Medium</HI> has infinite Radiations in every Point thereof;
to wit, a single Radiation from every one of those infinite Radiating Points.
Now these Radiating Points are not only all such as send out their own Light
which is generated in themselves, but all such likewise, as by Reflection or Re∣fraction,
are the Causes of reflecting or dispersing the Light, received from
other Luminous Bodies. Now the Eye is an Organ or Instrument by which all
those infinite Rays that are thus jumbled and blended together, and so might
be thought impossible to be separated, are so curiously sifted, culled, separa∣ted,
and parted from each other, that they are all again made distinct, and eve∣ry
one of them appropriated, as it were, to is distinct Point or Cell. So that as
there are infinite of those Radiating Points without the Eye that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mit those
Beams; so there are infinite of those receptive Points within the Eye that re∣ceive
them, each of which Points do only receive the Radiations from one of
those infinite Points without, and from no other whatsoever at the same time.
Now it is not only a Separation of these Rays thus passing in one single Point
<PB N="121" REF="155"/>
only of the Luminous Medium, for that would seem to be more easy, but it is
a Separation of all those infinitely infinite Rays that pass through the infinite
Points that are in a Superficies as big as the Pupil, or Black Hole of the Eye,
and a Reunion of all those radiations that come from any one Point, into one
Point again; so that the Eye may not improperly be called a Microcosm, or a
little World; it having a distinct Point within it self, for every distinct Point
without it self in the Universe; and when a Hemisphere of the Heavens is open
to its view, it has a Hemisphere within it self, wherein there are as many Re∣spective
Points for Reception of the Radiations, as there are differing Points for
emission of Radiations, and all those infinitely infinite Radiations, which pro∣ceed
from that whole Hemisphere of the Universe, and pass through the <HI>Area</HI> of
the Superficies of the Pupil of the Eye, are by this truly wonderful Contrivance
of the Eye, separated from each other, and conveyed to the distinct cells of the
Microcosm of the Eye. For the exact and curious Performance of which
Work, the Fabrick of the Eye is so curiously contrived, that 'tis beyond the
Wit of Man to imagine any thing could have been more compleat. Nay, It
could never have entred into the Imagination, or thought of Man to conceive,
how such a Sensation as Vision could be performed, had not the all Wise Con∣triver
of the World endued him with the Faculty and Organ of seeing it self.
How could it have entred into the Imagination of Man to conceive, how it should
be possible for such an Atom of the Universe as Man is, to be informed at the
Instant that a thing is done, how and where it is done, though Million of Mil∣lions
of Miles distant? Certainly no more than we can now imagine how it
should be possible for any Man here in <HI>London</HI> to know the particular Thoughts
and Inclinations of any one single Man in <HI>China</HI> or <HI>Japan,</HI> or of all the <HI>Chinese</HI>
or <HI>Japanese</HI> together, at the same Instant they are thought there.</P>
<P>Now the contrivance of the Eye is not more admirable for its Power of sepa∣rating
differing Rays from differing Points, one from another, than it is for con∣gregating
and culling all the infinite Rays that come from one Point, and Re∣uniting
them again into one Point; for by this, principally, is Vision made.
This is that which makes the Rays produce so powerful an Effect as to be sen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ible
to the Animal. Now this will appear more plain if we consider the Ex∣plication
I have formerly given of the Cause of Light in the <HI>Medium,</HI> and the
manner of its instantaneous Progression through it. This I shew'd you was a
Motion or Pulse caused by the Protrusion of the Bodies about the Center, a
certain space every way in <HI>Orbem,</HI> towards the Circumference. Now though
the length of this Pulse at the Luminous Body, as the Sun, from the Center out∣wards,
should be an Inch perhaps; yet since the length of that Pulse doth de∣crease
continually in duplicate Proportion of the Distance, reciprocally taken
from the Luminous Body; the length of the Pulse of Light here with us would
not be the 1000000 Part of the thickness of a Hair; now what can we imagine
or conceive could be so curiously sensible as to be moved thereby, or that the
animated Body, or any part of it, could be sensible of it, or affected by it?
certainly it could not, and therefore the all Wise Creator contrived the Eye to
be an Organ to restore again the Strength of that Pulse, which was destroyed by
the great interposed Distance; for by the means hereof, the Pulse that was, by
distance, shortned Million of Millions of times of the length it had at the Lu∣minous
Points; is by the reunion of them by the Eye again, restored to a good
part of its first Power, in the corresponding Point in the Eye: for as, whilst
Rays are diverging and spreading from the Luminous Point into a uniform <HI>Me∣dium,</HI>
the Pulse grows shorter and shorter in a duplicate Proportion to the Di∣stance
reciprocally; so in converging Rays (or Rays drawn to a Point, from a
Superficies) do the lengths of the Pulses increase in a contrary order: So that
in probability, in the Point of Reunion in the Eye, the Pulse may be almost as
long, as at the Point of Emission or Emanation. That this may be the better
understood, I would discourse a little upon a very common and obvious Expe∣riment
of setting Fire to a Body by the Rays of the Sun, collected by a Burn∣ing
Glass, whether Reflecting or Refracting, it matters not much to our present Reasoning.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="156"/>
Suppose then we have a Burning Glass of a Foot Diameter, or breadth;
which will collect all the Rays from the Sun, and unite them at fourteen Inches
from the Glass, into a Focus or circular Figure of the Sun of ⅛ of an Inch in
Diameter, we see first by Experiment, that the Rays so collected will set Fire
to Wood, and several other Combustible Bodies and consume them, whereas
the Rays of the Sun before this Union of them, were very hardly, perhaps, if
at all sensibly warm. If therefore we consider the Reason of this Effect, we
shall find that all the Rays which were before expanded into a Circle of a Foot
Diameter, are, by this Constipation made by the burning Glass, crowded and
thrust together into the space of a Circle ½ of an Inch in Diameter; we must
conclude that all that warmth that was in the Circle of a Foot Diameter, is
now in a Circle of half a quarter of an Inch. Now the Area of the greater
Being, to the Area of the less, as 9216 to one, it follows that the Heat of the
greater to the Heat of the less, must be Reciprocal to the Area, that is, as 1 to
9216, and consequently the impression of the Light at the <HI>Focus,</HI> must be more
than at the Glass, no less than 9216 times; and consequently the same as the
direst Rays of Light from the Sun would be, at one 96th part of the Distance
of the Earth from the Sun; and consequently as strong as it would be upon a
Planet about the Sun, which should appear to us at the Distance from the Sun
of 36 Minutes, or a little more than the Diameter of the Sun. Now in the
same manner as this Burning Glass acts upon the Rays of the Sun in constipating
and driving them together into a smaller room, does the Eye for all other
Rays of Light from Luminous Objects. Where that Impression or Action of
the Light, though In it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be very small, and wholly insensible even to
that part of the Eye, which is the most sensible and curious of all the Parts off
the Body, namely, the <HI>tunica Retina,</HI> as shall afterwards shew, yet is made
sensible by the Multiplication of its Force upon the Constipation of the Rays
into a <HI>Focus,</HI> which Acts and Terminates in that most curious Substance.</P>
<P>This is one way by which we may conceive somewhat of the Reason of
the curious Fabrick of the Eye for the Multiplication of the Action or Power
of Luminous Bodies, upon the sensible Animal Part.</P>
<P>2. The other way we may conceive how this Fabrick of the Eye does cause this
Impression to be Multiplied,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Eye Multiplies the Power of Light.</NOTE> Augmented, and become sensible, Depends upon
the consideration of the Hypothesis, which I propounded the last Term for the
explanation of Light, and that was by a Pulse or Stroke, according to the
length of which, I shewed you at that time, the Power or Strength of the
Light was.</P>
<P>This I explain'd to you by a sensible Experiment made by firing Gunpowder.
For a Corn or Grain of Gunpowder expanding it self, when fired in a Sphere
1000000 as big as its own Bulk, must necessarily act accordingly on the en∣compassing
Medium; but I need not repeat what was then said. Therefore to
return to the Instance of the Burning Glass.</P>
<P>Now by the Refraction or Reflection of a Burning Glass, all those Rays which
before were Diverging and spreading wider and wider from a Point, and so grew
weaker and weaker in the proportion I mentioned (that is, according to the
Superficies of the Sphere, or Basis of the Cone) by this Action I say of the
Burning Glass, they are made converging and approaching nearer and nearer to
gether; and so of consequence augmented and increased in Power and Effect,
and the Strength lost or rarified by the diverging, is renewed and revived by the
converging. And whereas in the diverging, the Diminution was very slow and
long, in this converging, the Increase and Augmentation is very quick and
short; for as the distance of the Burning Glass from the Sun, is to the distance
of the Burning Glass from its Focus; so is the Increase of Constipation,
by the effects of that Burning Glass upon the Rays, to the decrease of Expan∣sion
of them in their Progress from the Sun to the Glass; so that the Rays of
Light at half the Distance of the <HI>Focus</HI> from the Burning Glass, is the same
with the constipation of the Rays, at half the distance of the Sun from the
Burning Glass, and consequently the length of the Pulse, and strength of the
Ray is the same; and so at a tenth Part of the distance from the Focus, the
<PB N="123" REF="157"/>
Power or Action of Light, is as strong as it is at a tenth part of the Distance of
the Sun from the Burning Glass. So that if the distance of the Sun be 10000
Semidiameters of the Earth, and the Focus 14 Inches; the strength of the Light,
or the length of its Pulse or Stroke shall be the same at 1⅖ Inch from the Focus,
that It is, at 1000 Diameters Distance from the Sun; and consequently, the
length of the Pulse in the very <HI>Focus,</HI> must be the very same with the length of
the Pulse at the Sun.</P>
<P>3. Now the Action of the Eye being much the same upon the Rays of Light,
from any Luminous Object with this of the Burning Glass; it follows that the
Eye does by its Power bring all visible Objests into the bottom of it, and make
an Impression on the <HI>Retina,</HI> the same, as if the very Action of the Object were
immediately there.</P>
<P>3. So that the Substance of the <HI>Retina</HI> is affected or moved by the very same
Action,<NOTE PLACE="marg">These applied to the Eye.</NOTE> as if it touched the Object; and the Eye does continually make the
Hemisphere of Actions or Motions within it self, the same with the great visible
Hemisphere without it. And these Impressions are communicated to the Brain,
or sensated by the Animal Soul, if that Substance be in Health and Sound; if
not, the Impresson is Defective, and the Sight or Sensation Imperfect. As it
sometimes happens in some Distempers of the Brain and nervous Parts, in
which Cases the sight fails, though the Organ of the Eye it self be perfectly
formed, as in a <HI>Gutta Serena.</HI></P>
<P>There is a very remarkable observation of Monsieur <HI>Mariotte</HI> about Vision, that
the sensation Light is not made in the <HI>Tunica Retina,</HI> but on the <HI>Choroeides;</HI>
That that part of the bottom of the Eye which the <HI>Choroeides</HI> does not cover
is wholly senseless and blind, though the Impression of Light upon the Place be
the same as on the Parts that are contiguous, and lie about it.</P>
<P>Now this Gentlemans Observation is, that that part of the Eye, where the
Optick Nerve enters into The Cavity of it, which is not in the Axis of its Figure,
but at a pretty distance from it nearer to the Nose, namely, at about 25 Degrees
from the Axis in ward, is not cover'd with the <HI>Choroeides.</HI> And that we have no
sense of the Impression of Light made upon it.</P>
<P>The Experiment is this, take two small Candles in the Night, or in the Day
time, two small bits of White Paper of about the bigness of a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> let the
Candles be set on a Table at two or three Foot distance, so that the Flames
may be about the height of the Eye from the Floor; let the Papers in the Day
time be stuck against a dark Wall, or dark coloured Hangings, at about the
same distance, and the same height; then placing your self just before them,
and looking towards them, close one of your Eyes with your Hand; as suppose
your left Eve, and look directly on the Candle or Paper on your left Hand,
and you will see both the Objects very plain, that you respect, very clear and
distinct, and the other somewhat more Imperfectly; keeping your Eye thus
shut, and the right Eye respecting the left Hand Object, by Degrees go back∣wards,
'till at length you will perceive that the Right Hand Object vanishes,
and is no more visible; mark that Distance and you will find it to be at about
3¼ times the Distance of the two Objects, going yet farther backward, you will
again begin to see them both as before, <HI>viz.</HI> at the distance of about 4½; then
again going in this Posture nearer the Objects, you will find the Right Hand
Object disappear when you come to the former Distance, and when nearer,
they will both again appear, and so continue 'till you come close to them.
Now the reason of this Appearance is, that the Axis of the Right Eye being al∣ways
kept directed to the Left Hand Object, when you are at the aforesaid Di∣stance,
the impression from the Right Hand Object falls on that part of the
bottom of the Eye where the Optick Nerve is inserted, over which there is no
part of the <HI>Choroeides</HI> expanded, and the sensible part being wanting, the Sen∣sation
is not made, though the Impression be the very same; as on each side of
it, as I shall prove more particularly, when I come to explain the several parts
of this most curious Organ and what the Function and Use of each part is,
which I may make the Subject of some of my succeeding Lectures.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="158"/>
This Deduction of his was disapproved by Monsieur <HI>Pequet,</HI> tho' the Experi∣ment
was allow'd, who gave his Reasons for maintaining the <HI>Retina,</HI> the chief
Organ, for receiving the Species. This Dispute may be seen in the <HI>Philos. Tra∣nsact.</HI>
Numb. 35, <HI>&amp;</HI> 59. whether it be the one or the other, is not much to our
present purpose, therefore I shall leave it, and proceed.</P>
<P>4. I have endeavoured to explain to you that admirable contrivance of the
Organ of Sight, the Eye, whereby it Collects the Rays of Light, so as to make
an Impression upon the sensitive Part of it, of the Action, Motion, or Power
of the Luminous Object upon the immediately incompassing <HI>Medium,</HI> though
this Luminous Object be never so far distant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the Eye is not hurt by the Action of Light.</NOTE> and by that means, as it were in
an instant, to touch, or feel any such Object, as if it were contiguous to it, but
yet so as not to hurt or offend the sensible part; for the Eye taketh but a very
small Cone, or part of the Radiating Sphere; and thereby, though the Motion
be the same as to Velocity and Length of Pulse in every the smallest Cone or
Ray, that it is in the whole Sphere; yet being but a small part of the whole
incompassing <HI>Medium,</HI> it contains but a part of the Action of the Luminous
Point; for which Reason we are able to look upon the Sun, or a Fire, or an
exceeding bright Flame; as melted Silver, or Iron, or Sulphur burning upon
melted Niter, without much offending the Organ, if it be strong and vegete;
but if the Eye be weak, and the Impression be continued, it will much offend
it, and dull the Sense, whence it is that looking much upon Fire, or any such
bright Object, does very much decay the Sight, and makes it more insensible of
the weaker Impressions made by other less Luminous Objects: And hence we find,
that we are unable for a time to perceive Objects in a House or Room, imme∣diately
after we come in out of the Sunshine. Now by reason of the great Va∣riety
that there is in differing Objects, as to the Quantity and Strength, and
that the <HI>Retina,</HI> or sensating part is capable only of receiving Impressions to a
certain Degree of Strength, without being hurt by it, there is a contrivance in
the Eye, which I shall afterwards more fully explain, by which the Quantity
of the Rays admitted is moderated, so as to keep it, that the impression does
not exceed that limit: And this is the Aperture or Hole through the <HI>Iris,</HI> which
is the black Hole that appears in the middle of the transparent part of the
Eye; for this Hole which admits the Rays to pass into the Eye, is contracted
or dilated, according as the Object is brighter or darker; that a lesser Quanti∣ty
of the stronger Rays, and a greater Quantity of the weaker Rays may be ad∣mitted,
and hence it is, that a brighter Object among dimmer Objects, does
cloud and darken them, because the aperture of the <HI>Iris</HI> being contracted pro∣tionable
to the Strength of the brighter, the Rays, admitted from the faint∣er
and more dim Objects, are not sufficient to make a sensible Impression. So
that the effect of the Rays are by this means proportion'd to the Ability of the
sensible Part of the Eye to bear the Impression, and where notwithstanding the
utmost contraction of this aperture of the <HI>Iris,</HI> the Rays make too strong an
impression upon the <HI>Retina,</HI> we are forc'd to wink and close the Eye<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Lids nearer,
to shut out part of that quantity of Light which would otherwise have entred
into the Eye; or to look through a small Hole, or through an opacous Body.
And hence it is, that any one may with ease look upon the Sun, if he look
through a small Pin hole in a Plate, by which means one may with pleasure see
an Eclipse of the Sun, without using any opacous Glass; though if the <HI>Cornea,</HI>
or any other part of the Eye, be any ways opacous, this way discovers the De∣fects
of them, and does somewhat vitiate the Figure of the Object. But of
this, and the manner of contracting of the Pupil, more, when I come to explain
that part, of the Eye; that which I mention it for at present is, only to explain
how the Eye becomes it were a Hand, by which the Brain feels, arid touches
the Objects, by creating a Motion in in <HI>Retina,</HI> the same, and at the same In∣stant,
with the Motion of the lucid Object it self. For the make of the Eye
is such, in all its Contrivance and Parts, that the Conical Ray of Light pro∣ceeding
from a Point of the Object, and terminating with a Divergency in the
Aperture, or <HI>Cornea</HI> of the Eye; is by the Refraction thereof again reunited in∣to
a Point at the <HI>Focus,</HI> which is in the <HI>Retina;</HI> and consequently, whatever the
Motion or Power of the Light was in the <HI>Apex</HI> of the Cone, which is at the
<PB N="125" REF="159"/>
Luminous Body the same is the Motion or Power of Light; at the Point or
<HI>Apex</HI> of the Cone, made by the Refraction, and terminating in the <HI>Retina,</HI> so
that the Eye does, as it were, invert and shorten the conical Radiation, and con∣tracts
a Cone 10000 Semidiameters of the Earth in length, into the length of
an Inch or thereabout in a Man; from which Explication all the Appearances
of Vision, whether by the naked Eye, or by Telescopes, or Microscopes, will
be very naturally, and I conceive very truly explained; and the wonderful Wis∣dom
of the Great Creator more manifestly shewn.</P>
<P>5. We are therefore in the next place to consider the Fabrick of the Organ
it self, of what Parts it consists, and of what use each of them is toward the
compleating this Effect.</P>
<P>1. In the Consideration whereof, the first thing that represents it self to our
View, is the transparent part of it that is placed outwards, which is the en∣trance
by which the Rays pass into it.</P>
<P>I shall not need to mention the position of it in the Face, nor the Duality of
them, nor the Cells of the Skull in which they lie, nor the Lidds that cover it
when Sensation ceases, as in Sleep; save only that I shall afterwards shew you
the use of them for moystning, glazing, and clearing the <HI>Cornea</HI> from Dust and
other Fowlness; no nor of the various Muscles that serve to Rule it to and fro every
way, and direct and fix the <HI>Axis</HI> of it upon the Object to be viewed; the
contrivance of which is truly admirable, nor shall I take notice of any Anato∣mical
Observa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion concerning it, save only such as tend to explain the Make
and Fabrick of it, for performing this Effect of Collecting Diverging and pa∣rallel
Rays, and refracting them into a Point or <HI>Focus:</HI> Other considerations
thereof being more proper to be handled upon the consideration of other
Subjects.</P>
<P>Having taken the Eye out of its place, or Socket in the Skull, and having ta∣ken
off carefully all the Muscles that serve for its Motion, as being not now
considered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plate 1. Fig. 6.</NOTE> we have a round Ball shaped somewhat like that represented in
the fixt Figure <HI>A B E B F A.</HI> This Body is in a Man of about an Inch Diame∣ter,
and to <HI>B A B,</HI> is very near of a globous Figure, though in divers other
Animals it be of divers other Figures; some of them more deprest at the middle,
and nearer to the shape of a Turnip, and at about 25 Degrees from an imagin∣ed
Axis, which passes through the middle of all its parts, is inserted into it
the Optick Nerve <HI>F F,</HI> which Insertion together with all the Globous part of
the Ball, is covered with a thick, strong, and pretty sriff Coat, or Shell,
which serves as a solid Wall, to preserve the shape and figure of the Parts within,
to which also the Muscles, for its outward Motions, are fastned; and like∣wise
the Muscular Parts within the Eye, which serve for the inward Motions;
this is called the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; or <HI>Tunica Sclerotica,</HI> or hard Coat; and is a conti∣nuation
of the <HI>Dura Mater,</HI> or the outmost strong hard Bag that contains the
Brain; and by a curious Dissection may be found quadruplicate, as is also the
<HI>Cornea.</HI> This for the most part is white and opacous, and so permits no light
to pass it any way, though in some Creatures I have observed it to be pretty
Transparent, so as to shew the Picture of Objects without, made at the bottom
of the Eye, as in Young Kitlings: The formost part of this is of a more pro∣tuberant
Figure, and seems somewhat Elliptical; rising conspicuously promi∣nent
above the Superficies of the Sphere <HI>B A B,</HI> continued this Prominent part
<HI>B E B,</HI> is perfectly transparent, though it be of a flexible Substance, and from
some kind of Resemblance it has to Horn, is called the <HI>Cornea,</HI> or horny Coat:
This, as it is more round in the middle about E, than it is at the fide <HI>B B,</HI> so I
have observed it also to be thinner in the middle, than at the sides; so that it
resembles the description in the Figure. The Ellipticalness of the Figure, as it
may plainly be discovered by the Eye, without any other help, so more certain∣ly
by the Reflection of Images from its Surface, and by the refraction of it
when filled with Water, and looked through toward any near Object. Through
this transparent Coat or <HI>Cornea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fabrick of the Eye.</NOTE> the Rays enter into the Eye, and receive their
first and greatest Refraction towards their converging and meeting at the bot∣tom

of the Eye. This is much larger in some Animals, as in Cats, Owls, Leo∣pards,
and other Creatures that seek their Prey in the Night; and so is able to
receive a greater Quantity of those faint and dim Rays dispersed from Objects
at that time, in which Creatures also the Pupil of the Eye is capable of a much
greater Expansion and Contraction, as I Shall by and by observe. This may
give a very good hint of the possibility and practicableness of seeing in the
Dark, of which I have many Years since made divers tryals with very good
Success; and I have known several Men who have had such a Constitution of
their Eyes by Nature, that they would be able with Ease to see every Letter
distinct, when other Men, that otherwise had very good Eyes, could not see the
Lines.</P>
<P>The inside of this thick and hard coat of the Eye, is covered with another
Coat, being in various Eyes of various Colours, as Black, Blue, Brown, Green,
Yellow, and the like; it covers also the Optick Nerve, and is joyn'd to the
<HI>Sclerotica,</HI> by an infinite company of little Veins, and Arteries and Vessels;
this immediately joyns to, and, as it were, lines the Insides of the hard outward
Coat, so far as the vitreous Humour extends; namely, to <HI>B B,</HI> and is called
the <HI>Choroeides.</HI> But above this place it is separated from it in the aqueous Hu∣mour,
and is called the <HI>Uvea.</HI> The use of this, as to Opticks, seems to be for
the imbibing of the Rays of Light after they have imprest their Motion upon
the <HI>Retina,</HI> though I have observed in some Creatures, a strong reflection from
the bottom of the Eye, which could be from no other than the <HI>Choroeides.</HI>
What its Use is for conveying necessary supply and Nourishment to the Parts of
the Eye, is not my Subject.</P>
<P>To the inside of this Coat is joyned the <HI>Retina,</HI> which is that which im∣mediately
covers the vitreous Humour, and is the same Substance with the
Substance of the Brain, which is also the <HI>Medulla</HI> Marrow, or Pith of the
Optick Nerve. This by <HI>Des Cartes</HI> and most others, is supposed to be the sen∣sible
part of the Eye, which receives the impression of the Pencils of the Rays
of Light; though there are others of another Opinion, that the <HI>Retina</HI> being
the same with the substance of the Brain, has no sense in it, as the Brain it self
hath not, but that the <HI>Choroeides,</HI> as being the same with the <HI>Pia Mater,</HI> and
consequently of the most acute Sense, is that which receives, and is sensible of
the Impression of the Rays of Light: And to confirm this, the Experiment I
shew'd and explain'd to you the last day is brought as an Argument by Monsieur
<HI>Mariotte,</HI> which carries in it indeed very much of probability; for by that Ex∣periment
you have a sensible Proof, that in that part of the Eye where there is
no part of the <HI>Choroeides,</HI> as at the <HI>Medulla</HI> of the Optick Nerve, there you
are blind as it were, or insensible of the Light; whereas in that Place there is
the greatest Plenty of the <HI>Retina</HI> or <HI>Medullary</HI> Part; within this Coat is con∣tained
the Vitreous or Glassy Humour of the Eye which fills the whole lower
Cavity of it; it is called the Glassy Humour, not that 'tis so very hard; but
because it being very transparent and clear, it is of a greater conssitence than the
watery, being like a Jelly, and yet is softer than that which from its exceeding
clearness, not hardness, is called the <HI>Chrystalline;</HI> this is delineated by the Fi∣gure
<HI>G G.</HI> This Humour on the upper side of it has a Cavity in it, where it
receives the <HI>Chrystalline</HI> Humour, which is somewhat of the Figure delineated by
<HI>I H:</HI> the under part of which in a Man, and in most other Terrestial Ani∣mals,
is much more convex than the uppermost which is more flat; but in
most Fishes it is of a perfect Globular form; its of a pretty solid Consistence
so as to keep its Form after it is stript of the Coat or Skin, that covers it both
above and below, called the <HI>Aranea</HI> or Cobweb Coat, which is very thin,
strong and transparent, and is joyn'd to the <HI>Choroeides</HI> by the Edges, by means
of the <HI>Ciliares B H, B H,</HI> which seems to be Muscular, all the space between
the Crystalline Humour and the Cornea is filled with a very clear and liquid
Water, the Figure of which Cavity, and consequently of the Water contained
is exprest by <HI>I I,</HI> contain'd within the Cavity <HI>E B H B E.</HI></P>
<P>In this Water between the Chrystalline and the Cornea, is placed a Skin with
a Perforation in the middle of it, that is called the <HI>Uvea,</HI> exprest by <HI>B I, B I,</HI>

Animals is of several shapes, but in Men it is perfectly round, in Sheep of an
Oblong Oval, in Cats like a slit; in other Creatures of other Forms, the big∣ness
of which is more or less, according to the brightness or dimness, the near∣ness
or remoteness of the Objects seen, and has in it a kind of natural Motion
not voluntary, which is moved only by the various Impressions of the Objects.
And we have no other Power to open it than by looking upon dark Objects, or
of shutting it, than by looking upon bright and near Objects: The Limits of
which Motion in Men is not very great, but in Cats and other Creature, that
see in the Dark, very great.</P>
<P>This Watery Humour does sometimes breed a kind of Mother in it, so as to
become thick, and look White, and so hinder the Rays of Light in part, or in
whole, from passing through it, and when it is grown to a sensible Thickness,
is call'd a <HI>Cataract,</HI> but the Sight may be again recovered by couching that <HI>Ca∣taract,</HI>
which is nothing but thrusting in a fine Needle through the <HI>Cornea,</HI> and
with the Point of it breaking and crushing down to the bottom of the Eye this
Mothery Substance. This Humour, though it be all let out, will presently be
renewed again, and filled with Water as before, without destroying the Sight
of the Eye, as has been often experimented.</P>
<P>Thus I have shewed you all the parts of which the Eye consists, and the form
and manner of their Position in order to compleat this curious Organ to make it
fit for Vision; having omitted all those other considerations of it, which belong
more properly to Anatomy and Physick, my aim being only to take notice of
those things only serve for the explication of Opticks and Light.</P>
<P>It would be too long for this present Exercise to explain to you the exact Fi∣gure,
and the various Refractions of the several parts of the Eye, and to shew
you the particular use of every part of it, for compleating the collection of Rays
proceeding from the Points of the Luminous Object, and terminating them in as
many distinct Points at the bottom of the Eye, which I design, God willing, to
compleat, when I come to explain Refraction and the Laws thereof. And
therefore, I shall at present only mention to you, that that Collection <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
is made at the <HI>Retina</HI> or <HI>Choroeides,</HI> which, as I have shew'd, you are the
Coats that line the bottom of the Eye, and encompass the vitreous H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mour on
which they do describe, as it were, a perfect Picture, or Representation of all
outward Objects, as may be plainly seen by the Eye of a Kitling; <HI>the Sclero∣tis</HI>
or bottom of which is transparent, or by any other Eye, if the <HI>Sclerotis</HI> be
carefully shaved off so as to leave it transparent: And as I have done by a large
artificial Eye made with Glass, Water, and Jelly, figured according to the
shapes represented in the Scheme, which is a Section of the Eye, made by the
Optick <HI>Axis;</HI> that in this Picture are remarkable not only all the Lines and
Proportions, but the Lights, Shadows, Colours, Motions of the Objects them∣selves.
So that from a clear Understanding of this, the Reason, Cause, and
Manner of Vision will be clearly understood.</P>
<P>5. Now because the Structure and Making of such an Artificial Eye is very
difficult, and the use thereof notwithstanding, very necessary for a through
Knowledge of Opticks, I having only mention'd this at presenr, that such as
have a Mind to be curious in it, may, if they please, prepare the like.</P>
<P>I shall rather as a Supplement to it, make use of a darkned Room, or Per∣spective
Box, in which all the Appearances that are made in the Eye are in
some manner represented.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plate 1. Fig. 7.</NOTE> Prepare therefore a Box of the shape in the seventh
Figure, let it be four or five Foot long from <HI>A</HI> to <HI>D E,</HI> and make the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
of it <HI>B C,</HI> Concave towards the End A, and the bottom of the Box <HI>B D E C</HI>
being made Cylindrical, and not Tapering, as the part <HI>A F G</HI> is, that the mov<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble
bottom <HI>B C,</HI> may be placed nearer to or farther from the End <HI>A.</HI> And A place a
Convex Glass of the length of the Box in a Hole as large as the Glass, which
the larger it is the better, because of several Tryals that may be made with it,
which cannot be made with a smaller. To this Hole cut several, as eight or
ten Pieces of Past-board that may each of them serve to cover it, and in every
of them cut a Hole of a Round, or other Figure you would use, and either <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n
<PB N="128" REF="165"/>
the middle of it, or out of the middle of it, and of a greater or less Figure, ac∣cording
to the Tryals you design by them; let the inside of the Concave bot∣tom
be made very White, to receive and reflect, the Points of Light, and make
a Hole in the side of the Box <HI>H,</HI> covered about with Leather, or thick Wollen
Cloth, with a Hole large enough to put ones Face into it, so as to see the Spe∣cies
or Picture of outward Objects upon the bottom, then turning the end <HI>A</HI>
where the Glass is placed toward the Object (if the Sun shines upon it, it is
the better, because of the great Reflection of Light from such Objects,) slide the
moveable bottom <HI>B C,</HI> to or fro, 'till by looking in at the Hole <HI>H,</HI> you perceive
the Representation of the outward Objects very perfect, then take notice of the
distance of the Object, and likewise the distance of the bottom; the Position,
Magnitude, Brightness, Colour, and all the other Remarks that appertain to
the explaining the several Appearances that may happen to the Eye, then fit it
for representing Objects at a greater distance, and take notice of the distance of
the bottom, and all the other Remarks necessary for explaining your Inquiry:
The like may be done with▪ the various apertures of Pastboards, which may
serve to explain all that might happen to the Eye, by the contracting and dila∣ting
the Pupil, by observing the definedness of the Species on each side the <HI>Ax∣is,</HI>
and where they are most distinct; and so for all other Questions that may
happen concerning what Light is in the Eye, and what Effects it there produces.
It may be convenient to fix a Ball and Socket underneath it to make it more ea∣sy
to be managed. It may also be made square as well as Cilindrical, provided
the bottom of ir, <HI>B C,</HI> be a Concave of a part of a Sphere of the length of the
BoxesRadius.</P>
<P>Let this therefore suffice at present for explication of the first Principle of the
Emanation of Light from the Luminous Body, and for the Reception therof up∣on
the subject; that the Light is conveyed from every Point of the Luminous
Body, to every Point of the Body inlightned, through a uniform transperent
Medium by direct Emanations, or in imaginary straight Lines. The same Rule
holds in all Light that proceeds from an Object inlightned, that promiscuously
reflects the Light cast upon it every way, for such a Body may be said to shine,
as it were, by the Light of another Body, and may therefore upon that account
be said to be a secundary Luminous Body, and the Light a secundary Light,
such as that of the Moon, and the other Primary and Secundary Planets, so
that the same Rule will hold in both, and the inlightning and the inlightned
Cones are to be considered in the calculation of Rays from Bodies shining by a
secundary Light, and the Proprieties and Proportions to be observed in both, in
their Power and Propagation, will fall under the same Rules as I shall after∣wards
more at large explain and manifest.</P>
<P>Next, As light is thus propagated by imaginary straight Lines, so is also
Shadow, which is nothing but a Defect or want of a peculiar Light, taken off
or intercepted by an opacous Body, or of a Body that will nor permit the Rays
to pass onwards in its direct Course, which is only visible by Accident; that is,
by finding from that part a defect of the Influence of Light, which we are sen∣sible
of, every where about it. And by this means it is that we see the dark or
shaded side of the Moon in an Eclipse of the Sun; that is, we perceive such a
part of the light of the Sun taken off by the opake Body of the Moon coming
between that and us, but of it self it is no ways visible; for though we may be
said to see that shaded part of it which hides part of the Sun, yet we cannot see
any part of it which is without the Suns Limb, so were the Body of the Moon
in an Eclipse of the Moon, pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ctly within the shadow of the Earth, and that
no manner of Light by the refraction of the Sun-beams in the Atmosphere were
conveyed to it, we should see no other appearance of it, but only that some∣times
this, sometimes that Star would disappear which was covered by it, and
it is only distinguished by the Light about it.</P>
<P>This therefore comes under consideration only relatively with respect to Light,
and is to be calculated as a Defect, though the same Rules in calculation of the
two before mentioned Cones will here held also, but as Defects or like Quan∣tities
in Algebra marked with a Minus.</P>

<Q>1. Light, the <HI>Medium</HI> by which all or most part of the Knowledge we
have of the Celestial Bodies is conveyed to us. A farther confirmation of
a <HI>Plenum.</HI> Mr. <HI>Romer</HI>'s Observation of a temporaneous Propagation of
Light not conclusive. That the <HI>Medium</HI> is absolutely Dense, and where
the Parts are immediately contiguous, the propagated Motion must be in∣stantaneous.
2. Tho' this propagation be instantaneous, yet the impres∣sion
of this Motion is Momentary, or Temporaneous; therefore every Pulse
of Light is Momentary, and requires some time, tho' this is inconceivably
short. Mr. <HI>Hobb</HI>'s Expedient of a <HI>Conatus ad Motum</HI> insufficient.
That there must be an actual local Motion, and that able to break the
most solid Bodies. What Light is in the Agent, <HI>Medium,</HI> and Patient,
is explain'd by a familiar Example: All Motions local, and differ only in
the lengths of Spaces, and Moments of Time. 3. How Light is instan∣taneously
propagated <HI>in Orbem,</HI> evinced by a cogent Example, by which
all the Proprieties of its Motion are clearly explained. Two different Cones
may be considered between the illuminating and illuminated Bodies. Why
the Light of the Sun exceeds that of all the Stars collected, if the Stars were
brought nearer, tho' their <HI>Areas</HI> remain'd the same, yet their Light would
be greater. 4. The Proprieties of Light propagated in a transparent uni∣form
<HI>Medium</HI> to the Eye, reduced to four Considerations, each of which
are enlarged upon and exemplified. How the same Corpuscle may commu∣nicate
different Motions several different Ways, in the space of a Human
Moment, 5. Every sensible Moment of Time, as well as every sensible
Particle of Matter composed of infinite lesser; so that in the same sensible
Moment, the same sensible Point may be successively moved infinite Ways,
when the Vibrations of a string can be no longer discerned, they become
the Objects of another Sense, the Hearing; the sensible Moments of Crea∣tures
proportioned to their Bulk. Short lived Creatures may have as ma∣ny
sensible Moments as longer lived, and in some Sense be said to live as
long as Man. That there are infinite Spaces in the least sensible Space to
be moved; and lastly, the Velocities may be infinitely swift in each of
these Spaces. The bigger the Body is, the slower are its Vibrations. Les∣ser
Animals see those Vibrations which we can only hear. A Continuati∣on
of that Subject of the Propagation of Light. That the vast Number of
successive Impulses in a Human Moment is no Objection; so that upon the
whole, there may be assigned to the Propagation of Light, a real local
Motion. 6. From the former Reasons, the Author deduces the Cause of
the perfect fluidity of the vast <HI>Expansum</HI> of Matter or <HI>Aether,</HI> between
<PB N="130" REF="167"/>
the Planetary Bodies. Why one fluid Body hinders Motion thro' <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more
than another, instanced by some Experiments. <HI>R. W.</HI></Q>
<P>I have formerly explain'd here several Properties of Light,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Light the Me∣dium to convey all Celestial knowledge.</NOTE> which I have been
the more particular in, because it is the <HI>Medium,</HI> by which all the Knowledge
we have of the Heavenly Bodies is conveigh'd to us▪ for though we are affected
also by the Hear, yet it seems to be conveyed to us by no other Medium than
that of Light; for Light, as I have shew'd you, seems to be nothing else but
an Internal Motion of a Transparent, first begun▪ or imposed by the Luminious
Body, upon the Parts of the Uniform, or Transparent <HI>Medium;</HI> and then propa∣gated
through that <HI>Medium,</HI> to the utmost Extent, or Limits of it. Now
from the boundlessness of its Propagation, and the Instantaneousness also of it,
I conceive that the Parts thereof are absolutely Contiguous, and make a <HI>Plenum;</HI>
so that at the same Instant that a part is moved by the Lucid Body, at any one
part of the <HI>Medium,</HI> the utmost Extreams of the <HI>Medium,</HI> on that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ide towards
which the Motion is impressed, are moved also. And this agrees with the most
curious Observations that have been hitherto made concerning it; and though
Monsieur <HI>Romer</HI> indeavours to make it otherways by Observations made about
the <HI>Satellites</HI> of <HI>Jupier;</HI> yet, as I have formerly shew'd you, they are not sufficient
to prove his Theory; because, supposing his Observations and Calculations ex∣act,
yet there may be other as probable Causes assigned to solve the Appearances,
as this which he has assigned. So then if the Propagation be instantaneous, it
will follow, I say, that the <HI>Medium</HI> is perfectly Dense, or the Parts immedi∣ately
contiguous one to another; for if there should be Vacuities interspersed,
and so the Parts behind should be necessitated to move through that Space, before
it could touch the next, and that another space, before it could touch the third,
and that third another Space to pass, before it could touch a fourth, and so on∣wards;
it would follow, that the passing of every one of these Spaces would
take up some time, and consequently would make the Motion temporaneous
but where the Parts are immediately contiguous, the first cannot move without,
at the same Instant, moving the second, nor that without moving the third,
nor that without moving a fourth, fifth, sixth, and so forward, to an innume∣rable
Series, or to the utmost extent of the Medium. The ingenious <HI>Descartes.,</HI>
therefore, compares it to a solid Rod or Stick, whose Parts being all contigu∣ous,
the one End cannot be thrust forward, but that at the same Instant, the
other end is also thrust forwards, which is a plain and very sensible Explication
of what is meant by Instantaneous Propagation in the <HI>Medium, viz.</HI> a moving
together of all the Parts of the <HI>Medium,</HI> and not a successive.</P>
<P>2. Now though the Propagation be thus instantaneous,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Impression on the Medium m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mentary.</NOTE> yet the Impression of
this Motion on the <HI>Medium</HI> is Momentary, and though it be never so short a
Motion, and never so quick, yet it must be temporary; for if the moving Lu∣minous
Body does move, or remove the <HI>Medium</HI> before it; it must remove it
some space, and that Space cannot be pasted without some time; and therefore,
I conclude, that every Stroke, or Pulse of Light is Momentary, and lasts for
some space 'till a second Pulse or Stroke is impressed, though the Duration
of each Pulse be never so short; as suppose, but the thousand thousandth part
of a Second of time, yet a Thousand Thousand of such Pulses will make a Second
of Time, and though the space that it moves be but the thousandth Part of
a Hairs Breadth, yet even that is a Space, and has a <HI>terminus a quo,</HI> and a <HI>termi∣nus
ad quem,</HI> and an interjacent space, through which the Motion must be
performed in such a Space of time.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hobbs</HI>'s Expe∣dient insuffici∣ent.</NOTE> Nor will the Expedient which Mr. <HI>Hobbs</HI>
has found out, to save a Local Motion, serve the turn; for he would have it to
be nothing but a <HI>conatus ad motum,</HI> an Endeavour to move, and not a Real Mo∣tion,
and <HI>Descartes▪</HI> would have it a Propension to Motion, and not a Motion;
but what the one means by <HI>Conatus,</HI> and the other by Propension, if it be not
an actual Motion, I understand not; but as I shall hereafter prove, it must be an
actual <HI>Loco</HI>-Motion, for the Experiments I shall bring for that purpose, will
manifest it to the Sense to be a Local Motion, and that very considerable too,
in as much as it is able to break in Pieces even the most solid Body in the
<PB N="131" REF="168"/>
World.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A familiar Ex∣ample to ex∣plain these matters.</NOTE> Now when I see a Mason holding the Edge of a Steel Chizzel hard
against a very solid Marble Stone, with his Left Hand, and with his Right,
stricking upon the Top, or Head of that Chizzel, with an Iron Hammer, so as
to break off a piece of the Stone, I cannot but conclude that that Chizzel must
have had more than a <HI>Conatus ad Motum,</HI> to make the Marble break, and that
there was a real-Local Motion of the whole Chizzel together forwards, so far
as the Edge thereof did penetrate the Marble before it brake it. And this, I
hope, may serve as a sensible Similitude, by which I would inform the Under∣standing
what kind of Action or Motion it is, by which Light is first generated
in the Luminous Body: namely, like the Motion of the Hammer against the
Head of the Chizzel; next, how it is propagated through the transparent <HI>Me∣dium,
viz.</HI> the Medium is all moved together, even as the Body of the Chiz∣zel:
And, Thirdly, How that acts upon the Subject inlightned, and that is, af∣ter
the manner as the Marble is broken by the Chizzel. This may, perhaps,
seem but a coarse Similitude, for the Explication of the Motion or Action of
Light, which is the most curious and spiritual of all sensible things. But yet,
I have this to answer, that the more plain and obvious it is to be understood,
the better it is to inform the understanding of the manner how, an Operation,
which is too curious and fine to be reached by our Senses, is performed. And
though I cannot have an imagination of a Space, but the thousandth Part of
the breadth of a Hair, yet, by my Reason, I can be certainly informed that such
a Space there is, and even by Microscopes we can make such a Space visible,
and yet our fancy will diminish no farther than the least sensible Point to the
naked Eye; as the point of a sharp Needle or the like: But we are not less
certain of it, though we cannot imagine it, that is, make an Image or Repre∣sentation
of it to the Mind. Now we are by the Eye assured that there is
Light, and consequently, I say, there is a Motion impressed thereby upon that
Sense, because there is no Sense but what is made by an Impression of some Mo∣tion,
and that Motion is not impressed but by a Body moved with Local Moti∣on,
(for I cannot understand any other Motion,) and Local Motion must have a
Space to pass, and that Space must be passed in some time; and therefore Mo∣tions
can only differ in lengths of Spaces and Moments of time; if therefore I
understand, comprehend, and imagine one Local Motion that falls under the
reach of my Senses, I can by similitude comprehend and understand another that
is ten thousand Degrees below the reach of them, they having both the same
Proprieties, and differing only in the Spaces and the times; whosoever there∣fore,
endeavours to explain any insensible Way of producing an Effect, by
somewhat that is less intelligible than that which he would explain, acts prepo∣sterously,
as I could have instanced in the Explications of very famous Men,
which instead of informing, do much confound and perplex the Understanding;
but it would be too long for this place.</P>
<P>3. I shall therefore proceed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How Light is propagated <HI>in Orbem</HI> shewn.</NOTE> and that is, to explain, how the Motion of
Light is propagated <HI>in Orbem,</HI> for so we find it, which this Similitude I have
here used does not reach, but only that of a direct Ray; to make this there∣fore
plain to the Understanding, I would propound a hollow Cone or Brass, or
some other strong close Substance, whose bottom should be made of a yielding
Substance and Spherical, and the <HI>Apex</HI> should have a Cylindrical Hole, by
which it might be filled with Water, Quicksilver, or some other fluid Sub∣stance:
Into this Cylindrical Hole or Syringe, I would have fitted a Cylinder
so close as not to let the Water pass by it, having filled this hollow Conical
Vessel, I strike against the end of the Cylinder with a Hammer, and force it to
move the whole length of the Cylindrical Hole; In this case it is clear, that
the Water which filled the whole Vessel, and Cylindrical Hole must be all mov∣ed
towards the bottom, and at the same Instant that I force in the Cylindrical
Plug; now supposing the Water not capable of Condensation, and the sides of
the Cone not subject to stretch, and only the bottom capable of being moved;
I find that the Plug must have driven all the Water in the Cylindrical Hole in∣to
the Cavity of the Cone, and so must have driven forward as much as lay
next to it of equal space, into the space of another equal Quantity of Water,
and so onward; 'till that which touches the bottom must drive the bottom so
<PB N="132" REF="169"/>
much lower, as to inlarge the Capacity of the Cone enough to receive the Quan∣tity
of Water in the Syringe, forced into the Cone by the Plug. Now if we
consider this Similitude, it will explain some other Proprieties of the propaga∣tion
of Light. For, First, it is clear that every part of the Water must be mo∣ved
at the same Instant. Secondly, That there is no reason why the Motion
of all Parts that lie at equal Distances from the end of the Syringe, should
not have the same Degrees of Motion. Thirdly, Why the Parts that lie more
remote from the Syringe, have still the less proportion of Motion, communica∣ted
to them. Fourthly, It shews us plainly what that proportion is; namely, a
Proportion reciprocal to the Square of the Distances; for every of those Spaces
must be equal to the first, as therefore the same quantity of Motion, is expand∣ed
into a bigger and bigger <HI>Area,</HI> so must its Power upon an equal space of any
two Distances, have its Power reciprocal to the <HI>Areas</HI> of those Bases; so that
hereby we see clearly the reason why the Power of the Light at several Distan∣ces
is diminished in Reciprocal Proportion to the Expansion of it. And this may
serve for the Explication of the Propagation of Light, from any single Point
of a Luminous Object. Now the same, thing that we understand of any one
shining Point of a Luminous Object; the same thing I say, we are to conceive
of every one of the whole Luminous Body; for evey point of it doth in the
same manner propagate its Influence, Power, or Motion; for if instead of one
Syringe at the end of the Cone, there were Two, Three, or more such Sy∣ringes,
if any of them were moved, the Effect would be the same, as in that I
have mentioned already▪ and if all were moved together, every one would
have its Influence on the bottom, as if it had acted singly, and so evey Point
of the bottom would be affected, or moved by it, as well as every of those
Points would also be affected, or moved by every one of the other Syringes; as
suppose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 8. Plate 1.</NOTE> <HI>a, e</HI> and <HI>i,</HI> were the three Holes of these Syringes, and <HI>B, C, D, F,</HI>
were the bottom of the Cone; if the Syringe <HI>e</HI> were moved, it would propa∣gate
a Motion, or force to every point <HI>B, C, D, F,</HI> of the bottom <HI>B, F,</HI> so like∣wise
if the Syringe <HI>a,</HI> or the Syringe <HI>i,</HI> were moved singly, each of them would
propagate their Motion to every one of those Points, <HI>B, C, D, F,</HI> of the Base
<HI>B, F,</HI> and to every other Point of it. And consequently, all those Syringes
being moved together, must every of them influence or move every Point of the
Base, <HI>B, F,</HI> with its own distinct Influence. Now the same thing that will hap∣pen
in this Case, in the Pressure or Motion of the Water against the bottom,
will also be in the Case of Light; for if we suppose, <HI>a, e, i,</HI> to represent the
Body of the Sun, and <HI>B, C, D, F,</HI> the Surface of a Body inlightned by it; It
is most certain, that every Point of the Base or Object, <HI>B, C, D, F,</HI> is influenc∣ed
by every Point of the Superficies of the Sun that shines; so that there may
be considered in the Radiation of Light, between a Luminous Body, and an in∣lightned
Body, two sorts of Cones, each made up of infinite Radiations;
namely, the inlightning Cone, and the inlightned Cone; the inlightning Cone
I call that, which is propagated from one Point of a Luminous Body unto all the
Parts of the Body inlightned, such are <HI>B, a, F, B. B, e, F, B. B, i, F, B.</HI> the ac∣tive,
or inlightning Point being the <HI>Apex</HI> thereof, as <HI>a, e</HI> and <HI>i.</HI> And, 2ly, The
inlightned Cone, I call that, which has the inlightned Point for its <HI>Apex,</HI> and
whose Base is terminated at the Luminous Body, and all terminate in the in∣lightned
Point, so if <HI>a, e, i,</HI> represent the Body of the Sun, then <HI>a, B, i, a▪ a, C,
i, a. a, D, i, a,</HI> and <HI>a, F, i, a.</HI> do each of them represent a Cone, whence it will
clearly follow, that the bigger the inlightning Body is, the more Radiations there
will fall upon it, and the more the Cone will be inlightned; and this is one of
the Reasons why the Light of the Sun does so much exceed the Light of all the
Stars, because that in the Hemisphere of the Sun that Shines upon us, there are
more Luminous Points or Radiations than from all the Stars of a whole Hemi∣sphere
of the Heavens; but there is also a second Cause, and that is to be fetcht
from the greater Distance of the inlightning Bodies of the Stars; for, as I shew'd
before, the Power of the Light doth decrease reciprocally to the squares of the
Distance. For should all the Luminous Bodies of the Stars be diminished in
Diameter, according to their differing Distances, and be brought so near us, as
the Sun, and so appear all under the same Angle they now do, their Light
would be considerably stronger, and greater to us in the Night, and even in the
<PB N="133" REF="170"/>
Day than now it is; though the <HI>Area</HI> of them all put together, would be no
bigger than now it is; for the Light from the brightest Star, as of the great
Dog Star, though in a Dark Night it seem very vivid, yet could it be seen
with the Light of a part of the Sun appearing of the same Diameter with it, it
would look very faint and weak. And when I have viewed a Star in the Day∣time,
with a Telescope, though by the help of the Telescope I have mightily
fortified that Light, and so centuplicated its Power, yet after all, I found that
the Body of it has appeared fainter than the Body of the Moon at Noon.</P>
<P>4. These then are all the Proprieties we need to take notice of in a simple Propa∣gation
of Light through a transparent uniform <HI>Medium,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proprieties of Light to be ob∣served.</NOTE> Namely, first, that there is a
Propagation of Light from every Point of the Surface, in every part of the transpa∣rent
incompassing Medium <HI>in orbem,</HI> they each of them exert their particular
Influence in that Orb, as if they were all single and distinct. And, Secondly,
That the more of these single Rays there fall upon an inlightned Point, the more
it is inlightned, and that each of these Rays does act upon the inlightned Body
with the same Power, as if it acted singly, though at the same time, Millions
of Radiations from other Points do act upon it.</P>
<P>This does seem somewhat difficult to be understood how it should possibly
be so:<NOTE PLACE="marg">How a Body may communi∣cate different Motions diffe∣rent ways.</NOTE> But yet if we consider, that though we cannot by Sense apprehend the
very Manner of its Acting; yet we are not without sensible Examples of such
kind of Actions naturally performed: For if on the smooth Superficies of a
standing Water, we let fall a Drop of Water, we shall, I say, plainly see how
the Motion made by the fall of that Drop is every way propagated in Rings or
Waves increasing and spreading further and further from the Point where the
Motion was begun; and this every way with equal Velocity; which may be
argued from the perfect circular form of such Rings. But that which comes yet
nearer to the Similitude of Light, and for which Property only I mention it, is,
if we let fall at the same time 10 or 20 Drops in several distances one from
another, we shall find that every one of them will produce Rings about it;
each of which will continue to be propagated equally every way as regularly,
as if there had been but one Drop let fall: And though they variously cross
one another, and so, one would imagine, should confound the regular progaga∣tion
of each others Rings; yet whoever shall observe any one of them in the
time of such propagation, shall find that they are not in the least disturbed by
the Action of any other, though they may be crost with 20 such differing Con∣secutions
of Rings. And though, I confess, after all this, it does seem not a
little difficult to comprehend how one and the same Particle of Matter, or of
the transparent <HI>Medium,</HI> should at the same Instant propagate through it a thou∣sand
differing Motions, a thousand differing Ways; yet since we are assured
by the last Similitude of the Rings or Waves upon the Surface of the Water,
that it is actually done in Nature, and that visible to Sense, though we cannot
so clearly comprehend the Metaphysical Reason thereof: yet 'tis enough for a
Principle to build upon, that we are assured it is so, and that such and such are
the Effects that flow from it. So tho' it be difficult to comprehend the Metaphsical
Reason, why a Body which is by another moved with a certain Degree of Velo∣city,
should continue to move forwards in a right Line with the same Velocity
it received, till it be stopt by meeting with other Bodies, and communicating
that Motion to them: (For who can understand what it receives, and what
it parts withal, and what it is distinct from the Essence of a Body that so moves
it or stays it?) Yet since we are sensibly informed that really it is so, it will be
enough for a Physical Principle of Nature, of which we can have no further
Light or Information, that will make it more plain and certain to us. Now
though it do seem thus difficult to be explain'd, yet 'tis not wholly impossible.
I do confess, the Consideration they have about it, of the necessity of the Pro∣pagation
of it many various Ways through the same Body, in the same Instant,
does much confound the Imagination; because who can imagine a Body to com∣municate
Motion to another, without its being actually moved it self? And if
it be actually moved it self, how can it move more than one way at once?
And if it moves but one way, how can it move all the opposite Bodies with
their peculiar Propagations?</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="171"/>
5. But to this it may be answered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sensible Mo∣ments composed of infinite other.</NOTE> first, that there are in every <HI>sensible</HI> Point
of Matter a sufficient number of distinct Particles to convey every one of those
Motions distinct, without interfering one with another: For as there may be
Millions of Motions communicated to a <HI>sensible</HI> Point, so there may be as
many Millions of distinct Particles to receive each of them distinctly.</P>
<P>But besides that every sensible Moment of time is composed of infinite Instants,
or of an indefinite number of other Moments of time of a shorter duration; so
that within a moment of time that is sensible to a Man, the same sensible Point
may be moved many Millions of ways succssively, and so communicate each of
those Motions distinct, without being confounded with any two: And the next
human Moment may have and convey as many others, as many several ways.
Now that this may be so, we may yet farther consider, that Motions may be
infinitely swifter than sensible Motions; that is, than those Motions that we
can see a <HI>Prius</HI> and <HI>Posterius</HI> in: For the swiftest Motion that we can see, is
that wherein we can distinguish the Body moving from the <HI>Terminus a quo</HI> to
the <HI>Terminus ad quem,</HI> in a sensible time, or a sensible moment: For if it be in
both within the least moment of time we are able to distinguish, it seems to us as
if it were in both the terms and the interjacent space altogether. For instance,
take a long String, and stretch it out between two Pins; if it be long and but
slack, we are able to see and distinguish it, as it moves from one side to the o∣ther,
and how it returns again, because it makes its Vibrations within the com∣pass
of several human Moments of time; and if it come within three sensible
Moments, we seem to see it in three sensible Places. But if it be strain'd yet
straighter, so as to make its whole Vibration within one human Moment, we
see it as if it were in all parts of its space and in the two <HI>Termini</HI> at once, a∣bout
which time, and not before, it begins to sound. Upon the same account
it is, that if you take a Coal of Fire in the Night, and move it to and fro
pretty quick, it seems to make a perfect Line of Fire; whereas if it be moved
slow, you see it distinct as a Body moved. I could give a hundred Instances by
which I could make it manifest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sensible Mo∣ments of Crea∣tures proporti∣oned to their bulk.</NOTE> that the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> thereof proceed only from
the length of time there is in the shortest Moment of a Man.</P>
<P>And I do not at all doubt but that the sensible Moments of Creatures are
somewhat proportion'd to their Bulk, and that the less a Creature is, the shor∣er
are its sensible Moments; and that a Creature that is a hundred times less
than a Man, may distinguish a hundred Moments in the time that a Man di∣stinguishes
one. For when I hear a Fly moving his Wings to and fro so many
times, with such a Swiftness as to make a Sound, I cannot but imagine, that
that Fly must be sensible of and distinguish at least 3 Moments in the time that
it makes one of those Strokes with his Wings, for that it is able to regulate
and guide it self by the Motion of them. And the like may be said for the
quick Motions of other lesser Creatures. So that many of those Creatures that
seem to be very short lived in respect of Man, may yet rationally enough be
supposed to have lived, and been sensible of and distinguished as many Mo∣ments
of time as a Man; because within that space of time it has lived, it has
had as many distinct Moments of time, and has had as many distinct Diffe∣rences
of Moments, as a Man hath in the Age he lives. But this only by
the by.</P>
<P>But farther, in the third place, as there are infinite Parts in the least sensible
Part, and infinite Moments in the least sensible Moment; so there may be in∣finite
Parts of Space in the least sensible Space to be moved. For since all Space
is infinitely divisible into lesser, we cannot say how little a Space is necessary to
be moved to make a sensible Propagation of Light. Possibly the thousand
thousandth Part of the least sensible Space, may be sufficient to be moved, to
make the continuation of the Propagation of Light through a Particle. Now
we are sensibly informed by the Microscope, that the least visible Space (which
is that which appears under an Angle of half a Minute of a Degree) may be
actually distinguished into a thousand sensible Spaces: And could we yet fur∣ther
improve Microscopes, 'tis possible we might distinguish even a thousand
more Spaces in everyone of those we can now see by the help of those Micro∣scopes
we have already. Now possibly a less Space than the least of these may
<PB N="135" REF="172"/>
be enough for a Body to be dislocated in the Motion that is necessary to produce
the Propagation of a Ray of Light.</P>
<P>But then in the fourth place, Velocities may be infinitely swift in those Spa∣ces:
For who can imagine the smallness of time that a Motion can be perfor∣med
through the smallest of those Spaces?</P>
<P>To explain which a little further, I say, 'tis evident first to the Sense of See∣ing,
that the bigger the Body is, the slower is its Vibration, and the smaller,
the quicker: Which is evidenced to the Eye in all pendulous Motions, and in
the Recursions and Vibrations of Pieces of Timber, which the longer and big∣ger
they are, the more slow are the Vibrations made by them; and the smaller
and shorter, the quicker. But then where the Eye is unable to assist us any fur∣ther
in distinguishing the swiftness of Vibrations, there the Ear comes in with
its assistance, and carries us much further: And as I shewed before in the Vibra∣tions
of Strings, so now I instance further in Bells, where we find by the Tone,
that the smaller the Bell, the sharper and more shrill its Sound; and this car∣ries
us on to a Sound so sharp, that we only call it screeking, and at length it
becomes offensive to the Ear, because beyond that it cannot endure the Sense of
a shriller Note or quicker Vibration: For that the Shrillness of the Note depends
upon the quickness of the Vibration, I think I need not instance. Hence I con∣ceive
that there may be yet beyond the reach of our Ears infinite shriller and
shriller Notes, which may be distinguished by Ears or Organs of Hearing adap∣ted
by their lesser Bulks and finer Parts, to distinguish those quicker Vibrations:
And therefore those lesser Creatures that we discover, tho' possibly they cannot
hear those Sounds which we hear, but are able to distinguish every Turn and
Return of the Vibrations of them by the quickness and aptness of their Sight;
yet they may have as great variety in the differences of Sounds wholly imper∣ceptible
to us, as we have within the reach of our Ears. And as the Voice of
Man is limited to a certain number of Notes, lower or higher than which no
Human Voice can reach; so may it be in the Voices or Sounds made by those
smaller Creatures. That this may be so, we may argue yet farther from the
Curiosity and Make of their Sight; for we plainly enough see, that the smaller
the Eye is, the smaller is the picture of the visible Object that is made at the
bottom of it upon the <HI>Choroeides</HI> or <HI>Tunica Retina.</HI> And this, as I may here∣after
explain, is as demonstrable from the Principles of Refraction and Op∣ticks,
as any one thing in that Science: Which if so, how small will be the
Picture of the Object that is painted at the bottom of one of those Eyes which
by a Microscope we discover in the Cluster of the Eyes of Flies, and other
small Insects? And yet after all this, we have no reason to doubt that these
Creatures are able to distinguish as many single Parts in those Pictures, as a Man
can in a proportionate Picture at the bottom of his Eye. For as the Sensation
of a Man's Sight is limited to a certain bigness, less than which none can distin∣guish;
which, as I have elsewhere shewed, is not less than what is comprised
within about a half a Minute of a Degree, at most, of the Orbicular Part of the
bottom of the Eye; which in all probability is from the bigness of the smal∣lest
sensible Part receiving the Image, or of the Optick Nerve that is capable of
conveying a distinct Motion or Sensation to the Brain, as <HI>Des Cartes</HI> has very
ingeniously explained: So in these small Creatures, where every thing else is
proportionably smaller, 'tis not at all to be doubted but that those Fibres that
convey the Sensation to their Brain, are proportionably also smaller; and conse∣quently
that they must have at least a Faculty of distinguishing the Parts of
that Picture, which whole Picture may possibly be made upon much less than
half a Minute of a Degree of the Orbicular Part of the bottom of their Eyes
only: For as the Space of those Fibres is shorter between the bottom of the
Eye and the Brain, so may their bigness be proportionably smaller. All which
Particulars consider'd, it does seem that Nature has as it were ballanced the
Gifts bestowed upon them by some other Means adapted more particularly to
each of their Constitutions; as were it proper for this Time and Place, I could
more particularly explain and demonstrate. But these Speculations being only
by the by, I shall rather proceed with my Discourse concerning the Nature of
Light, so as to make the manner of its Operations mechanically and sensibly
intelligible; by considering further, that if there be a real Motion necessary for
<PB N="136" REF="173"/>
every distinct Propagation of Light, then it will seem to follow, that every
luminous Point must have its distinct Moment to be propagated this way and
that way within the space of a sensible Moment: Which if it be affirmed to
be so, I see no Reason in Nature why it may not be possible, and that from those
four Considerations I before specified. So that though the whole Hemisphere
should be filled with lucid visible Points, as we find in a clear starry Night, that
it is pretty thick set with Stars, and by Telescopes we discover it to be yet
thicker: Why, I say, Impressions may not be made from every one of them
distinctly and successively upon one single sensible Point of Matter in one hu∣man
moment; and consequently why the same Chime of Impulses may not be a∣gain
repeated the next Moment, and so perpetually in every human Moment: For
'tis not the Number of them that would at all impede such a Conclusion, no,
not if there should be ten thousand times as many more; for there might be
found smaller Moments enough within that Space of a sensible or distinguish∣able
Moment, to fit every one with one at least: so that the same point of
Matter might communicate every one of their Impressions distinct and successive∣ly
within that Period: And besides this, there might be found distinct Parts
enough, within the Orb of this least sensible Point, to propagate every one of
those Motions distinct, their various ways, by appropriated Parts, all at the
same Instant.</P>
<P>So that upon the whole, we may assign to every Propagation of Light through
the least sensible Space, a real temporary local Motion. And if Mons. <HI>Des
Cartes</HI> by his Propension to Motion, and Mr. <HI>Hobbs</HI> by his <HI>Conatus</HI> or Endeavour
to Motion, do not mean such a real local Motion, their Notions are neither of
them intelligible to others, nor did they really understand them themselves.
For bare Propension to Motion, is not Motion, and consequently cannot pro∣pagate
Motion: And Endeavour to move is not moving, and so cannot proga∣gate
Motion: But for the Propagation of Motion, Motion is necessary. And
this I hope has shewed a Possibility at least, if not a Probability, how it may
be made.</P>
<P>6. If then this be so, we may hence deduce the Cause of the perfect Flui∣dity
of the vast quantity of Matter which fills the whole <HI>Expansum</HI> of Space
between the solid Caelestial or Luminous Bodies of the Universe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cause of the Fluidity the vast <HI>Ex∣pansum.</HI></NOTE> And we may
thence bring a demonstrative Reason why it becomes so free from impeding the
Motions of the Planetary or Cometical Bodies that are moved through it. For
if every one of these Luminous Points, the Fixt Stars, which fill almost every
Point of the Heavens in a clear Night (as is made yet much more visible by
the help of long Telescopes) be as glorious and Luminous Bodies as the Sun it
self, though they here appear incomparably less, and of a fainter Light, by
reason of their Distances indefinitely almost more distant from us than that is: If,
I say, every one of those Fixt Stars, or glorious Suns, be stuck up and down
here and there in the vast <HI>Expansum</HI> of Matter that fills the whole of Nature,
not at equal but various Distances one from another; and every one of those do
really once at least within the space of one human Moment of time, really
move the whole <HI>Expansum</HI> of the Ethereal Matter (as 'tis most evident and
demonstrable they do;) then what can there possibly be more rationally contri∣ved
to make and preserve the perfect Fluidity of the <HI>Aether?</HI> For every Point
of Matter is Millions of ways, and consequently with incredible Velocity mo∣ved
to and fro within the compass of one single Moment, and so must necessa∣rily
have its Parts indefinitely divided, and loose one from another; and con∣sequently
being thus fluid, and the minute Motions ballancing each other in
every Point of Matter, and these Motions being proportionably swifter than the
swiftest Motion of the more bulky Mass: It follows, I say, that the Impedi∣ment
to any bulky Bodies moving through it, must be inconsiderable, or almost
nothing. For the Parts of this Matter being indefinitely smaller than the least
sensible Point, and the Motion of each of them, though never so small, being
within the compass of a human Moment determined every way, or infinite
ways, the Motion of them one way must ballance that of others another, and
consequently give no Impediment to the sensible or bulky Body moved through
them. I could have proceeded further from one and the same Principle to have
<PB N="137" REF="174"/>
explain'd how this continued Chime of Motions from every Part do create va∣rious
sorts of harmonical Motions in concrete Particles, which have their various
and admirable Effects in producing the Harmony which is in Nature. But of
that some other time, this will be enough at present, to intimate that every one
of these Caelestial Bodies have their share in the Motion of the Matter of the
World, and every one of them act more or less powerfully, according as they
are nearer and nearer posited to the Parts acted upon; and consequently the
Sun, as I before hinted, becomes in our Parts more considerable than all the o∣ther
Caelestial Bodies. 'Tis possible there may have been in some former Ages of
the World, a Notion somewhat like this; but not so well understood by those
that we are beholden to for the Hint of it: Which may be argued both from
the <HI>Platonick</HI> and <HI>Pythagorick Theorys,</HI> and much more from those Scraps we
have of the Philosophy of <HI>Confucius,</HI> the <HI>Chinese</HI> Philosopher, who was contem∣porary
with <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> but wrote of the Philosophy of an Age fifteen hun∣dred
Years before him: But the regaining of it is not to be hoped from any of
their Hints, but from a clear and steddy Geometrical-Method of Reasoning,
proceeding from the more sensible to the more abstruse and insensible Causes and
Effects of things.</P>
<P>Nor can I conceive any other Notion why one Body should resist or hinder
Motion more than another,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why one Fluid hinders Motion more than ano∣ther</NOTE> than that the one is less fluid than another; that
is, that the solid Parts of the one fluid Body are smaller than the solid Parts of
the other fluid Body. And we find it evident to Sense in sensible Fluids, where
we may sensibly be assured, that the grosser the Particles of the fluid Body are,
the more impediment does that Body give to the Motion of another Body
through it. As upon the evaporating of Liquors that have solid Bodies in them,
in the mixing of Pouders with Water or other Liquors, and in the mixing of
Salts and Sugars; which give a much greater impediment before they are dis∣solved
into Fludity than afterwards. If then from sensible Experiments we
proceed to Effects insensible yet evident to Reason, we may conclude that the
Aether must be abundantly more fluid than any other Body, and indeed may be
said to be indefinitely fluid; and so the Resistance that it must give to bulky Bo∣dies,
must be indefinitely small, because there is so mall a Part of it dislocated
by the transit of a Body, being indeed nothing but a meer Superficies, or the Parts
of it that are next contiguous to the Body moved through it. But of this I
shall upon onother occasion say more, when I shew the Cause why the Bodies
moved through them, though they do really every moment dislocate as much
Body as is equal to them in Bulk, do notwithstanding receive little or no im∣pediment
to their progressive Motion.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore I give the Contents of this Section, I think it may be convenient▪
in order to the better understanding of what follows, to premise, That
our Author having thus far prosecuted his Inquiries into the Nature of Light,
What it is in the Luminous Body, to wit, a certain Vibrative Motion of its
Parts, of a determinate Velocity. 2dly, What the <HI>Medium</HI> is, how it is
acted upon by Light, and how Light is thereby propagated, with all the ne∣cessary
Qualifications of this <HI>Medium.</HI> 3dly, What this Action is on the
Eye, and how the Powers of Light are exerted upon the sensible Part there∣of,
to cause Vision: Instead of proceeding farther in the Method he had
proposed to himself, of explaining hove the Rays or Pulses of Light from the
Luminous Bodies are Reflected, Refracted or Inflected, by a successive
Refraction, bending the Ray into a Curve; which several Subjects I suppose
he design'd to treat of, though I do not find he ever did (except of Inflection,
of which see <HI>Micrography,</HI> p. 217.) being diverted by other invervening
Subjects, which carried his Thoughts other ways: And indeed the Field of
Nature is so large, and so plentifully adorn'd with tempting Curiosities,
that it is a Restraint upon the Collector, not to leave one before it is thorough∣ly
examined, to reach at another. I say, when our Author had treated on
these Heads so far, he leaves this Subject, I must confess, in some sense im∣perfect;
and taking occasion from his having mention'd Time and a Human
Moment, he wrote the following Discourse, wherein,</P>
<Q>1. The Author attempts to shew how we come by the Notion of Time, tho'
the Impressions on the Senses are all momentary. The <HI>Communis Sen∣sus</HI>
not sufficient for this purpose, therefore there is a necessity of suppo∣sing
some other Organ. This he conceives to be what we call Memory,
and then he proceeds to give an Hypothesis to explain Memory, and
how it is performed: That Memory is organical: That the Soul, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
an Incorporeal Being, yet in performing its Actions makes use of Corpo∣real
Organs: That Memory is the Repository of Ideas form'd by the
Senses, or rather by the Soul it self. 2. The Action of the Soul in or∣dering
and storing up Ideas, is call'd Attention. The Author's Notion
what it is: That the Place of the Repository is somewhere in the Brain,
whose Substance is the Material out of which Ideas are formed, the
Chain of which is coyled up in the Repository, the Soul being at the Center
where the present Idea is made, which is the present Moment; and
hence comes the Notion of Time and Duration, and is apprehended as a
Quantity. 3. A Mechanical Representation supposed for the better Ʋn∣derstanding
the several Operations of the Soul, <HI>viz.</HI> Apprehending, Re∣membring
and Reasoning. That there may be same certain Point in
the Brain, where the Soul has its chief Residence, and there receives its
Informations, and gives its Orders. This Repository is furnished with
<PB N="139" REF="176"/>
adapted Matter for the Ʋses of the Soul: Five sorts of Matter for the
Impressions of the Five Senses: That for Sight explain'd by the <HI>Bono∣nian
Phosphorus:</HI> That for Sound by the Vases in antient Theaters and
Ʋnison-tuned Strings. Smelling, Tasting and Feeling also after the
same manner are explained. 4. Out of this adapted Matter the Ideas
formed are material and bulky, of determinate Figures, Sizes and Mo∣tions.
That the Soul forms one Idea each Moment, which Moments
differ in duration in different Men. A Computation of the number of
Ideas that may be form'd in a Man's Life. That the Number will not be
found to be an Objection against this Hypothesis. That Attention is the
Action of the Soul in forming Ideas, and what they are. That they con∣tinually
protrude each other from the Center. That the Soul by its Radi∣ation
and the Re-action of the Ideas, becomes sensible of them, and so of
Time. How it is sensible of many concomitant Ideas. How some
Thoughts lost may be recovered. That this Radiation and Re-action
weakens in a duplicate proportion to the distance of Time. That the
Soul may exert its Power on any particular Idea, according to its own
Will. That there is a continual Radiation of the Soul in the Repository
of Ideas, and is in some sense reacted upon by them; whence comes
what we call a bringing to remembrance. 5. The Action of the Soul called
Thinking, is a more particular Radiation thereof to this or that part of
the Repository. Thinking is partly Memory, and partly an Operation of
the Soul in forming new Ideas. Reason a more compleat Action of the
Soul from comparing Ideas. As the Repository is better stored, so the
Soul acts better. The Soul a self-moving Principle and <HI>Primum Movens.</HI>
The Soul compared to the Sun in the Great World. If the Sun had Ʋn∣derstanding,
it would be sensible of the Resistance its Rays meet with.
This explain'd by Hearing and Seeing. A double Influence from the Sun
on Bodies and their Motions. Tho' we cannot conceive how the Soul, be∣ing
spiritual and incorporeal, acts upon Ideas that are corporeal, or can
be acted upon by them; yet we are assured such Effects are performed.
That the Soul is net confin'd to act only upon these Ideas, but may extend its
Power to every part of the Body, and possibly to some considerable Distance
from the Body. <HI>R. W.</HI></Q>
<P>BEfore I come to the discussing of the particular Matters treated of the last
Section,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How we come by the Notion of Time.</NOTE> I would a little further consider what I have been discoursing of,
<HI>viz.</HI> Time: And here, since it is a general Maxim in the Schools, that <HI>Nihil est in
Intellectu, quod non fuit prius in Sensu,</HI> I would query by what Sense it is we
come to be informed of Time; for all the Information we have from the Sen∣ses
are momentary, and only last during the Impressions made by the Ob∣ject.
There is therefore yet wanting a Sense to apprehend Time; for such a
Notion we have: And yet no one of our Senses, nor all together, can furnish us
with it, and yet we conceive of it as a Quantity. For this therefore, since we
cannot find any external or outward Sense, we must seek within, and we shall
find there is somewhat like that which is called <HI>Communis Sensus,</HI> which is re∣ceptive
of all the outward Impressions of the other Senses. But still this is
insufficient to afford us the Notion or Knowledge of Time; for the Impres∣sions
on that can be no other than the Impressions from the other Senses, con∣veyed
by the <HI>Media</HI> of the sensory Nerves, which mast be also momentary, as
well as the first Impressions, and consequently do not yet sufficiently inform us
of the Notion of Time. Considering this, I say, we shall find a Necessity of
supposing some other Organ to apprehend the Impression that is made by Time.
And this I conceive to be no other than that which we generally call Memory,
which Memory I suppose to be as much an Organ, as the Eye, Ear or Nose,
<PB N="140" REF="177"/>
and to have its Situation somewhere near the Place where the Nerves from the
other Senses concur and meet.</P>
<P>Now that it is really,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Memory Orga∣nical</NOTE> I argue from this, that it may be both im∣proved
and impaired, it may be destroyed and exalted to a great Perfection.
It is at some times sensible, and at other times wholly insensible, as particularly
in Sleep: And whenever 'tis so, we have no Sense of Time, but we pass over
all that Space of Time, as if it had not been, and we only come to under∣stand
it by other Circumstances. Besides, we have often known that the Me∣mory
has been quite destroyed by a Fall, or great Blow upon the Head, by a
Fever, or other great Sickness; nay often by Excess of Drinking, all which
affect not the Soul: And in probability, this might be caused by some Wound,
Hurt, Bruise, or some orher Distemper of that Part, which we conceive to be
the Organ of Memory; which makes it an unfit Organ for the Soul to make
use of for that effect; and consequently the Soul can no more remember with∣out
the Organ of Memory, than it can see without the Organ of Sight, the Eye,
or hear without an Ear. For the Soul, or first Principle of Life, tho' it be an
Incorporeal Being, yet in performing its Actions, makes use of Corporeal
Organs, and without them cannot effect what it wills.</P>
<P>Memory then I conceive to be nothing else but a Repository of Ideas formed
partly by the Senses, but chiefly by the Soul it self: I say, partly by the Senses,
because they are as it were the Collectors or Carriers of the Impressions made
by Objects from without, delivering them to the Repository or Storehouse
where they are to be used. Which Impressions being actual Motions, as I have
plainly proved in the Explication of the Organ of the Eye, and the Operation
of Light, those Motions conveyed to this Repository become Powers sufficient
to effect such Formations of Ideas as the Soul does guide and direct them in:
For I conceive no Idea can be really formed or stored up in this Repository,
without the Directive and Archiectonical Power of the Soul; and the Actions
or Impressions cease and fail without the concurrent Act of the Soul, which
regulates and disposes of such Powers.</P>
<P>2. This Action of the Soul is that which is commonly called <HI>Attention,</HI> by
which what is meant no one does further or more intelligibly explain, than on∣ly
by giving the same Notion by some other ways of Expression, which, it may
be are as little intelligible. My Notion of it is this, that the Soul in the Action
of Attention does really form some material Part of the Repository into such a
Shape, and gives it some such a Motion as is from the Senses conveyed thither;
which being so formed and qualified, is inserted into and inclosed in the com∣mon
Repository, and there for a certain time preserved and retained, and so
becomes an Organ, upon which the Soul working, finds the Ideas of past Acti∣ons;
as if the Action were present.</P>
<P>This Repository I conceive to be seated in the Brain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author's Motion concern∣ing Ideas.</NOTE> and the Substance there∣of
I conceive to be the Material out of which these Ideas are formed, and
where they are also preserved when formed, being disposed in some regular
Order; which Order I conceive to be principally that according to which they
are formed, that being first in order that is first formed, and that next which is
next, and so continually by Succession, from the time of our Birth to the time
of our Death. So that there is as it were a continued Chain of Ideas coyled up
in the Repository of the Brain, the first end of which is farthest removed from the
Center or Seat of the Soul where the Ideas are formed; and the other End is
always at the Center, being the last Idea formed, which is always the Moment
present when considered: And therefore according as there are a greater number
of these Ideas between the present Sensation or Thought in the Center, and
any other, the more is the Soul apprehensive of the Time interposed.</P>
<P>These are the <HI>Supollex</HI> of the Soul, and these are the Instruments it makes
use of in the apprehending of things or Actions past; and by these it becomes
sensible of all that it really knows, and according to the Perfection or Imper∣fection,
the Multitude or Paucity, the Regularity or Irregularity of the Order
and Disposition of these Ideas in the Repository or Memory, the Aptitude or
Ineptitude of the Substance for Formation, Radiation, Disposition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> so is
the Soul the better enabled, First, to form new Ideas aright, or rightly to ap∣prehend
the thing to be known. Secondly to apprehend the Order according
<PB N="141" REF="178"/>
to which they have been formed, and are ranged; that is, to know the time,
or, to speak in the common Phrase, to remember what is past, as if it were
present, and how long it is since it was done, by the number of Ideas beween.
The Soul therefore understands Time, or becomes sensible of Time, only by
the help of the Organ of the Memory, which Organ is this Repository of Ideas,
and by means of the Order, Situation and Distance of the said Ideas, from
the Center, or one among another, so it becomes sensible of Time: And Time,
as unnerstood by Man, is nothing else but the Length of the Chain of these
Ideas, between any two that are at any time apprehended together: And ac∣cording
to the Number of the Links in this Chain, so is the Impression made to
the Soul that apprehends it, of a longer or shorter time interposed; and the
Notion of Time is the Apprehension of the Distance of Ideas from the Center
or present Moment. And so Time comes to be apprehended as a Quantity,
and so falls under the Consideration of Geometry and Mensuration.</P>
<P>3. Now because nothing is so well understood or apprehehded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A sensible Re∣presentation of the Matter.</NOTE> as when it
is represented under some sensible Form, I would, to make my Notion the more
conceivable, make a mechanical and sensible Figure and Picture thereof, and
from that shew how I conceive all the Actions and Operations of the Soul as
Apprehending, Remembring and Reasoning are performed.</P>
<P>I suppose then that there may be a certain Place or Point somewhere in the
Brain of a Man, where the Soul may have its principal and chief Seat.</P>
<P>I will not now enter upon Arguments or Reasonings from Experiments or Ob∣servations,
to determine the precise Place, though concerning the definitive Po∣sition
thereof, I have much that I may at another time produce: But I will
only suppose at present, that there may be some such Place whereinto all the
Impressions made from the Senses upon adapted Matter may be deliver'd;
which Impressions, as I have elsewhere explain'd, are no other but actual Loco∣motions
given to the Parts of Matter or Bodies so or so moved.</P>
<P>I suppose then this Repository to be furnished with variety of Matter adapted
for the Uses to which the Soul applies them, which I call the Elements out of
which Ideas are made; among which Variety there are principally five sorrs fit∣ted
and adapted to receive the Impressions from the five Senses; that is, one
peculiar Kind for the Impressions of Sight, which is of such a Quality, Form,
Make, Bulk, or other Constitution, as makes it Receptive and Retentive of the
Impressions of Light and Colours, which none of the other Bodies are capable
of. Which may a little be explain'd by the Matter of the Phosphoros made
of the <HI>Bononian</HI> Stone, or that found out by <HI>Baldwinus</HI> made of Chalk and
Niter; which Matters are so made and adapted by the Chymical Preparations
of them by the force of Fire and Mixtures made in their Processes, that they,
so soon as exposed to the Impressions of Light, receive and retain those Impres∣sions,
though for no long time, yet enough to shew us a Specimen of a certain
Qualification not to be found in most other Bodies, which may yet possibly be
done much more powerfully and effectually by the Chymistry of Nature in the
Digestions and Preparations made in the wonderful Elaboratory of the Animal
Body; where all things are are ordered and adapted by the All wise Creator,
for the Work to be done: So that nothing can be imagined wanting or redun∣dant
to perform what is by his Intention design'd to be done.</P>
<P>Another sort of Matter I suppose to be that which is fitted to receive the Im∣pressions
of Sound, somewhat like those Bells or Vases which <HI>Vitruvius</HI> men∣tions
to be placed in the antient Theaters, which did receive and return the
Sound more vigorous and strong; or like the Unison-toned Strings, Bells or
Glasses, which receive Impressions from Sounds without, and retain that Im∣pression
for some time, answering the Tone by the same Tone of their own.
And though in these Examples (which I am fain to bring for Explication only)
there seems wanting the great Requisite of a Power to retain for a long while
those Impressions which are so given, they all of them losing them in a very
short time; yet, as I shall by and by shew, they do and will each of them re∣tain
their several Impressions long enough to make them sufficient for producing
the same Reactions whenever they are again acted upon. And such an Impress∣ion
I shall prove is again given both by the Soul and by succeeding similar Sen∣sations:
<PB N="142" REF="179"/>
Far having Potentiality of receiving, and being excited by such Im∣pressions,
they do again renew their former Impression, and afresh shew their
Power, in the same manner as the Musical String or Bell, or the well prepared
<HI>Bmonian</HI> or <HI>Baldwin</HI> Phosphorus do each shew their Natures, when the one is
struck or agitated by Motion, and the other acted upon by Light.</P>
<P>The like appropriated Materials I suppose also for the Impressions of the other
Three Senses, <HI>viz.</HI> Smelling, Tasting, Feeling; each of which are qualified to
receive and retain the Impressions from the other Senses. As for instance, the
Smell being caused by a subtil and curious Exhalation from the odoriferous Body
imbibed by the Air, the Olfactory Nerves are prepared with an aerial Body fit
to dissolve or imbibe that Substance in the same manner as the Air does from
the odoriferous Body; which aerial Body, by means of the Olfactory Nerve,
having an immediate Intercourse and Passage to the Brain, does immediately
convey it thither: And according to the nature of this aerial or spirituous Sub∣stance
with which the Olfactory Nerve is furnished, so does it dissolve or im∣bibe
this or that Exhalation out of the Air. Whence I conceive that it is of
distinct Natures in every Species of Animals, and thence that every one of them
have distinct Sensations of the <HI>same Effluvia,</HI> and that which is congruous and
agreeing to one, is of a contrary nature to another; and thence what is grate∣ful
to one is odious to another. And again, what is sensible to one sort of
Creature, who has an aerial Substance fitted to dissolve and imbibe such or such
a Steam, is wholly insensible to another that wants that aerial Substance, and
is furnisht with one of a differing Nature. Which I conceive to be the reason,
why Dogs and other Creatures have so strong a Faculty of smelling the Scent
of Animals, or the Flesh of them, which are very hardly discoverable to a
Man. On the other side, in probability Man is sensible of many things, as the
Smell of Flowers, Herbs and Fruits, which possibly a Dog does very little, if
at all scent.</P>
<P>The like may be said of the Taste, which I conceive lies only in the Nature
of the watery Liquor conveyed by the Nerves of Taste to the Tongue, accord∣ing
to the Nature of which for dissolving this or that Substance of the Bodies
touching it, is the Impression of Taste conveyed to the Brain. And so we may
see a clear Reason why one Taste may be tasted by one, which is not by another,
and why one Taste is pleasant to one Creature which is not so to another, and
how a Body becomes gustable or tasteless, and how that which is tastless in it
self may be made tastable, and why that which is tastable may be made taste∣less.
of both which kinds I could give hundreds of Instances which would
much confirm this my Theory, and shew what Improvements of this kind could
be made. The like, I conceive, is to be said of an adapted Matter for receiv∣ing
and retaining the Impressions of Feeling, somewhat after the nature of the
warming Stone, and several other such Substances, which do imbibe those Im∣pressions
more readily, and retain them for a longer time. Now I do suppose,
that the Repository is continually supplied with a sufficient quantity of these
kinds of Substances, with which the Sense does continually form Ideas, and
dispose of them into the Repository of Memory, and that without those Ma∣terials,
and the concurrent Impressions of the Senses, it cannot form them:
For otherwise a blind Man would have Ideas of Colours, which yet he has not,
and a sick Man would have a true Idea of Tasies, which yet he has not.</P>
<P>But to return to the consideration of the Place or Repository where these Ideas
are form'd and retain'd.</P>
<P>4. I suppose there may be about this place, which I will hencesforward call
the Center,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ideas ma∣terial and bul∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.</NOTE> a certain Sphere of Capacity filled with adapted Matter, for the
Formation, Reception, and containing of all the Ideas which shall be emitted
from the said Center. These Ideas I will suppose to be material and bulky,
that is, to be certain Bodies of determinate bigness, and impregnated with de∣terminate
Motions, and to be in themselves distinct; and therefore that no
two of them can be in the same space, but that they are actually different and
separate one from another; and as they have their distinct Figures, so have
they each of them their distinct Qualifications of Motions and Constitutions.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="180"/>
I will suppose further, that the Soul may every moment, partly by its own
immediate Power, and partly by the help of the Impressions produced by the
Senses, form one of these Ideas, and insert it into the Repository. Which
Moments in some Men may be more, in some may be less, within the same
compass of time, according to the Activity of the Soul it self, and according
to the Aptitude or Unfitness of the Matter to be wrought upon. So that in
some there may be Four of them formed in a second Minute of Time, in o∣thers
possibly not One in two Seconds of Time: And according to the Per∣fection
and Aptness of the Matter to be formed, and the Activity of the Soul in
performing its Effects, so are there more of these Ideas formed within the same
Space of time. So that a Man of an ordinary Constitution of Soul and Body,
that is, one of a middle Degree between the more active and quick, and one of
the more slow and dull, may within the compass of his Life, supposing he
should live to a hundred Years of Age (which yet not one of a hundred thou∣sand
thousand does arrive to) form within that compass of time, and store up
in his Repository, a thousand Millions of distinct Ideas; all which may have
followed each other in a continued Series, beginning with the time of the first
Advertency of the Child, and continuing to the time of the actual Separation
of the Soul and Body at Death, Which I thus compute: A hundred Years
contain 36525 Days, and 36525 Days contain 876600 Hours, and 876600
Hours contain 3155760000 Seconds. Now one with another, when the Soul is
intent and acting, there may be 3600 formed within the compass of an Hour,
and so one in a Second of Time. So that if the Soul could through the whole
Course of 100 Years be continually so intent, and so acting and forming these
Ideas, and inserting them into this▪ Repository or Organ of Memory, there
might be there reposed 3155760000 Ideas. But by reason of Sleep interposed,
one third Part of the Number will be taken off, the Soul then for the most part
ceasing to form Ideas, or when it does, they are only imperfect and lost. So
that there will remain but 2103840000, or to take a round Sum, but 21 hundred
Millions. Now if we examine this remaining two thirds of Time or Moments,
and therein consider what part of the time remaining is lost in Infancy, Old
Age, Sickness and Inadvertency, we may well reckon that two thirds of these
remaining Moments are lost, and no Ideas at all formed in them; and so in∣stead
of 21 hundred, there will remain but the number of 7 hundred Millions.
And if we again consider how small a part of these are industriously and care∣fully
stored up, we may very well agree, that not above a seventh Part of these
are stored up: And so one hundred Millions may be a sufficient Number to be
supposed for all the Ideas that may have been treasured up in the Organ of Me∣mory
through the whole Course of a Man's Life, though of a hundred Years
continuance; and consequently one Year with another may be supposed to add
to this Store about one Million of Ideas. But if we consider how much this
will amount to for every Day, we shall find that yet the Number is very much
too big, and must be yet very much diminished: For when we consider that
this will still make 2738 Ideas for every Day of the hundred Years; and if a
Man considers with himself how many he conceives he may have added to his
Store in one Month next last past, I am apt to think he will conclude, that one
with another, it will be enough to allow one Tenth of that Number for the
Number of Ideas that have obtained a Place in this Repository, the Organ of
Memory. So that if a Man allows but two or three hundred a Day, nay, but
one hundred for every Day he hath lived, since he was born to his present Mo∣ment,
he will find that Number large enough to contain all the Ideas he has
really stored up in the Organ of his Memory. As supposing a Man of fifty
Years of Age, who according to that compute must have lived 18262 Days;
and consequently if you reckon but a hundred for each Day, must have 1826200.
It will be very hard, I conceive, for a Man of that Age perfectly to remember so many distinct things, though yet I will not say it is impossible. But suppo∣sing
he could by recollecting remember 100 Millions, and consequently must
have as many distinct Ideas, I see no Reason why all these may not actually be
contained within the Sphere of the Activity of the Soul acting in the Center.
For if we consider in how small a bulk of Body there may be as many distinct
living Creatures as here are supposed Ideas, and every of these Creatures per∣fectly
<PB N="144" REF="181"/>
formed and endued with all its Vegetative and Animal Functions, and
with sufficient room also left for it to move it self to and fro among and be∣tween
all the rest, so as to pass by every one and touch none, we shall not need
to fear any Impossiblity to find out room in the Brain where this Sphere may be
placed, and yet find room enough for all other Uses, of which we may after∣wards
assign some very necessary.</P>
<P>But to return to the Description of this Organ. I do suppose that what we
call Attention is nothing else but the Action of the Soul in forming certain Ideas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attention what.</NOTE>
which for the present I will call little Images, which bear the Stamp, Seal or
Mould according to which the Soul formed it in the Center of the Repository.
I suppose further, that these are continually formed by the Soul in the Center,
and the present always protrudes those that were formed before it further into
the Repository. So that the greater the number of Ideas are that have succeed∣ed
any ones Formation, the greater is the Space of Time of which we have
a Sense: and the ideas become further and further removed from the Center,
and more and more new-form'd Ideas interpose themselves between the Center
and the said Ideas placed in Orbs at a greater distance, by the intrusion of fresh
Ideas between the Center and them.</P>
<P>I suppose further, that all these Ideas, though they may for a long time re∣tain
the Forms and Motions impress'd on them by the Senses, and by the Action
of the Soul; yet notwithstanding they being material, and so subject to change,
I conceive, that as the Motions may in time decay, so the Form may (by shift∣ing
and changing place in the Repository or Organ of Memory, and being pro∣truted
farther and farther from the Center or Seat of the Soul, and crouded
into Orbs, though further off, yet closer and closer stuffed and crouded toge∣ther)
be in time alter'd, and sometimes quite lost.</P>
<P>I suppose further, that the Soul being seated in this Center, and there acting,
as I said, by the help of the Information and Impressions of the Senses, and
forming continually new Ideas, and so protruding them onwards, and filling
the Sphere of the Repository fuller and fuller from the Center, increasing out∣wards.
I suppose, I say, that this Soul by its Radiation does actually appre∣hend,
or as it were feel, or is sensible of any Idea that remains treasured up
within this Repository: And this it becomes sensible of, partly from its own
Power of Radiation, and partly from the Re-action of the Ideas. It becomes,
I say, sensible of them, wherever placed within the Repository; partly by its
own Radiation, by which it acts upon the fluid Spirits incompassing it, propa∣gating
from it self every way <HI>in Orbem,</HI> a Radiation like the Sun, by which,
as by a Stick, it becomes sensible of all those Ideas that are yet unwasted with∣in
the Repository, feeling as it were their Form, their Resistance, and their
Re-action to its Radiations: Partly, I say, only by their lying in the way of
the Radiation, and partly also by their re-acting and repercussing a Radiation
back upon the Soul. By the Distance of it from this Center the Soul becomes
sensible in some measure of the time in which the Idea was made, and how
long since it was inserted, there being so many Orbs of later or more inner Ideas
formed and lying between them, which have been since inserted.</P>
<P>By this means it becomes sensible of many Ideas that accompanied that Idea,
when made, many of them having kept the same Order in which they were
made; though oftimes other Ideas, not formed immediately before or after,
intrude and thrust in themselves between, out of the order they did really suc∣ceed
in, so as often to interrupt and break the Chain or Order of Insertion.</P>
<P>I conceive further, that besides the natural Decay there may be of the Form
and imprest Motion of the Ideas, there may be also an Impediment to this
Radiation of the Soul, by the Interposition of other Ideas between the Center
and the Idea sought, much after the manner as the Earth interposing between the
Moon and the Sun, hinders the Sun from radiating upon the Moon. And in
such case the Idea may sometimes be thought to be lost, which yet may after∣wards
be found again when the Obstacle is removed.</P>
<P>Again, as in the Radiation of the Sun, which is as it were a Representation
of the Soul of the World; the Radiation of the Soul is more powerful upon
Ideas at a nearer than at a further Distance; and their Reaction is also more
powerful back again, and that in a duplicate proportion to their Distance reci∣procal
<PB N="145" REF="182"/>
much the same with that of Light, which is the most spiritual Action
of all we are sensible of in the World. And thence it is, that the Memory of
things long since done is for the most part very faint, unless in some cases, where
the Impressions made upon those Ideas were at first very powerful, or often
recalled, which may be said to be a new forming of them.</P>
<P>I suppose further,<NOTE PLACE="marg">There is a con∣tinual Radia∣tion of the Soul into the Repo∣sitory.</NOTE> that though by means of the continual Radiation of the
Soul into this Repository or Organ of Memory, it has at all times sense
of all the Ideas that are there reposed, yet that Sense is but imperfect and
confused by reason of the Multitude; yet can it readily exert its Pow∣er
more particularly and strongly to this or that Idea, according to the Deter∣mination
of its Will. And whensoever it is upon the Action of Thinking,
that is, of fixing or darting its Radiation more powerfully upon this or that
Idea placed in the Repository, it does according to the Power of its Radiation
receive a more sensible Impression or Repercussion from those Ideas upon which
it radiates, and thereby it does not only apprehend their Qualifications more di∣stinctly,
but also it does as it were renew or refresh the former Impressions, and
add to them a further degree of Perfection: And so though they are in a Place
farther distant from its Center, and by the length of time or the number of
Ideas that have been since inserted, and so lie in the way of Communication,
it be become more faint and weak in the retaining the first Impression, and conse∣quently
in its re-acting Power; yet by this second Action or Radiation of the
Soul upon it, its Form and Qualifications are renewed and perfected, and for
the future it becomes more powerful than the rest of those at the same or lesser
Distances, that have not been by such second Radiations so renewed and invigo∣rated;
and besides every such Action of the Soul does create and form a new
Idea at the Center, which has Impressions that are the Result of those renewed
Actions: And this having somewhat the like Figure and Motions or Qualifica∣tions,
it has a Sympathetick Agreement with the other; and the Impressions
from the one do more readily make the Impressions from the other more sensible,
in the same manner as a Musical String being moved, does make another String
that is unison or harmonious with it, move also, and so together make the
Sound the louder, or the Impression the stronger.</P>
<P>Next, as I suppose there is a continual Radiation of the Soul into the whole
Repository of Ideas, so I do conceive likewise that every Idea so placed being
so qualified as above, by particular Impressions of Motions, which continue for
a long time so to move, as they were at first impregnated, does from such its
Power so retained, radiate a Motion of its own, which may in some manner
also act upon the Soul, so as to excite it to Attention; and by this means also
whenever any Idea is created and impregnated with Motions or Qualifications
similar to those of other Ideas placed at some distance in the Repository, the
concurrent Impressions or Re-actions of those similar Ideas upon the Soul at that
time do make the fainter to be the more notable, and so excite the Soul to At∣tention
or Radiation that way also; and by that means it has an Excitement to
be more sensible of the other also at that moment: And this I take to be that
Impression which we are sensible of, when we say, This brings to my Mind, or
This puts me in mind, or this makes me remember, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>5. I do further conceive, that that Action of the Soul which we call Think∣ing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Thinking is.</NOTE>
is a more particular Radiation of the Soul to this or that part of the Re∣pository,
or on this or that Idea placed in it, and at the same time forming new
Ideas in the Center of the Repository; which Action of the Soul in framing
new Ideas at the Center, is continued almost every moment: And though it
doth not every moment make a distinct Idea, yet may it be perfecting of one,
and giving new Impressions every moment: And thence I conceive the Body of
one Idea (for as I before mention'd, I suppose them to be really corporeal and
material) may have many and various Impressions and Motions annexed to it,
possibly of 100, nay of 1000 Moments, whence that Idea may be supposed to
be more compleat and perfect in it self: And when it again comes to be acted
upon by the Radiation of the Soul, all the Impressions or Qualifications there∣of
become of Power to affect the Soul with those Impressions which it had for∣merly
received from the Soul.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="183"/>
So that Thinking is partly Memory, and partly an Operation of the Soul in
forming new Ideas.</P>
<P>Another and more compleat Action of the Soul, is the forming new Ideas
from the comparing the Re-actions from several Ideas placed here and there in
the Repository, and its being sensible of the Harmony or Discord of them one
with another, which does produce an Idea wherein all those various Respects are
in some means united and impressed upon one and the same Idea. This is an
Idea of greater Perfection, and according to the Attention of the Soul in being
sensible of more and more variety of former Ideas, and the Regularity and Order
of its proceeding in that Action, and the more steddy and distinct manner in
the Course and Progress of it, so is the Idea more compleat, as well as more
compounded: And this I conceive to be that Action of the Soul which is com∣monly
called Reasoning; and the Conclusion is the new Impression made upon
the Idea informing from the comparison of other Ideas which may be contain'd
in the <HI>major</HI> and <HI>minor</HI> Propositions.</P>
<P>Now according as the Repository is stored with more and more Ideas, so has the
Soul a greater variety to range and expatiate into, whether these Ideas are only the
first and more simple, such as are the Results from the Impressions of the
Senses; or the more compounded, such as are made by the Result of comparing
several together: And therefore accordingly the Ideas that are made from few∣er
and more simple Ideas, are less compounded Ideas; and those which are
made from a greater number, and those more compounded Ideas, are yet more
and more compounded, and more and more accomplish'd and perfect. This
will give some Reason why the younger and first Results of the Actions of the
Soul in forming Ideas, are more simple and less perfect, and from whence the
Results of the Actions of the Soul in the elder Years, become the more com∣pounded
and perfect.</P>
<P>The Soul then is the <HI>Primum movens,</HI> the self-moving Prin∣ciple,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Soul a self-moving Principle.</NOTE> which has in it
self a Power of radiating every way <HI>in Orbem</HI> from its Center of being every
instant and for ever, and so is always by means of that Radiation every where
as it were actually present, in every point of the Sphere of its Radiation,
though yet it may be supposed to be more immediately and powerfully present
in the Center of its Being. It is not, I conceive, possible to be truly understood
or described, but only by Similitude; and the best Similitude for that purpose,
I conceive, is the Sun in the great World.</P>
<P>Now if we consider the Sun in the Great World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Compared to the Sun.</NOTE> we shall find it first a Being
which has in it self a Power of radiating or dispersing Light into the Whole
of Nature, and (consequently by this its Influence) of being as it were every
where present, and of being sensible of all those other Bodies that are placed
any where throughout the whole <HI>Expansum:</HI> For as it doth by its Radiation
influence and affect every Point of the Universe, so must there be a kind of
reflex Influence upon it self from every such Point: For as any one, and every
one Ray it sends forth, does meet with and affect any Body in its way, so
consequently must that End of the Ray that touches the Sun, have a greater
or less Resistance to be moved forwards; and consequently if there were Un∣derstanding
in the Sun it self, it must be sensible that this or that Ray does some∣where
in its Progress receive such or such an Impediment to its Propagation
or moving forwards that way. And be not only sensible, that somewhere
that Ray meets with an Impediment, but it may be sensible also at what di∣stance
that Impediment or Re-action is given to its Progress: For supposing the
Resistance or Re-action of all those impeding Objects, where ever placed, to
be in themselves equal, the Impediment or Resistance to that End of the Ray that
is moved by the Sun, must receive a Resistance proportion'd to the nearness of
the impeding or re-acting Object; and consequently the Impediment made there∣by
upon the End of the Ray protruded by the Sun, must be reciprocally pro∣portionate
to the Distances of the impeding Object; and consequently by the
proportion'd Resistance or Re-action of the Objects, there is a manifest Distin∣ction
at that End of the Ray that touches the Sun, of the Distance of the Ob∣ject
touched by it. Next by the number of the Rays that receive Impediment
from that Object, there is a manifest Distinction of the bigness of that Object;
for if the Angle of the Cone of Rays that receive Resistance from any Object,
<PB N="147" REF="184"/>
be actually made and has its Being at the Sun, and that the Distance of that
Resistance be likewise distinguishable at the Apex of it at the Sun, then is
there a Manifestation or Indication at the Superficies of the Sun (by means of
this Radiation) both of the Distance of the affected of affecting Object, and of
the Angle or Magnitude of it at that distance, and not only of the Magnitude
and Distance, but of the differing nature of the Resistance or Re-action of the
Object of such a bulk and such a distance, by the consecution of momentary
Impressions. This I could plainly demonstrate by a Similitude drawn from the
Action made upon the Organ of Hearing, from which the Ear is not only in∣abled
to judge of the Magnitude and Distance of the Sound, but of the Flat∣ness
and Sharpness, the Musicalness and not Musicalness by the like Distinctions
in it.</P>
<P>But it may be much better explain'd by the Eye, wherein we find, that though
there be no Radiation immediately emitted by the Eye, which would make the
Reactions to the Center the stronger; yet is the Eye able by the reflected Re-actions
only of Objects that are acted directly upon by the Sun, to discover the
Figure, Colour, Magnitude, Distance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of all Objects from which there
can come to it self that free Radiation. So that the Soul in the Center of the
Repository, is sensible of all the Ideas placed in it, as the Eye is sensible of all
things that are placed before it.</P>
<P>Next, if we consider the Sun in the Great World, we shall find it to be pla∣ced
in the Center of a Space, all which Space, and all Bodies placed within
that Space, it does more particularly influence by an attractive Power of draw∣ing
all bulky Bodies to it, or of commanding all the Motions of them; and con∣sequently
may have fense of the Renitency of Bodies, as well as of the Motions
and Distances of each of them. So that all Bodies, more especially within the
Sphere of its Activity, do receive a double Influence from it; first of being
radiated, inlightned and vivified; and secondly of being regulated and govern'd
in their Motions by it. And hence the Bodies so placed, as they have each of
them peculiar Properties, Shapes and Motions of their own, so have they also
particular Influences, Radiations, Excitations and Regulations communicated
to them from the Sun, which gives them not only their regulated Motions and
Positions, but also a kind of new Being or Activity, by which they become vi∣sible
and sensible to the rest of the World, which would otherwise be dark
and insensible, and vagrant here and there uncertainly in the <HI>Expansum</HI> of the
Universe. So that the Soul forms to it self a Microcosm, or Picture of the
Macrocosm, in which it radiates, and is sensible of every thing contain'd
therein, in the same manner as the Sun in the Macrocosm.</P>
<P>Somewhat of this kind is the Influence of the Soul upon the Ideas placed
within the Sphere of its Radiation: And though I cannot conceive how the Soul,
which is incorporeal, should move and act upon the Ideas which are corporeal,
or how those on the other side should by their Proprieties, Qualifications and
Motions, re-acts upon and influence the Soul; yet I am assured, that such Ef∣fects
are performed both by the one and the other Beings; and without them,
neither the Sensation, Cognition, Remembring, nor Ratiocination, could be per∣formed;
all which are plainly the Results of the conjunct Influences of the Soul,
and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>deas or Bodies placed within the Repository or Sphere of its Activity.</P>
<P>Now though by what I have been saying, I have endeavour'd to shew that the
Soul has by its Radiation a more than ordinary and commanding Power overall
the Ideas placed within the Repository; yet I would not be understood so to limit
its Sphere of Radiation, as nor to suppose that it may have a much bigger Sphere
of influencing Power, and thereby may extend it, not only to all and every Point
of the Body inlivened and preserved by it; but possibly it may extend even out
of the Body, and that to some considerable Distance, and thereby not only in∣fluence
other Bodies, but be influence'd by them also. And upon this account I
could produce a Multitude of Observations and Reasons, to prove not only the
Possibility, but the Probability, nay almost Certainty of such an Influence, and
this from the Sensibleness of others Ideas, <HI>Lupus in Fabula, Fascination,</HI> &amp;c.
of which possibly some other time.</P>
<Q><PB N="148" REF="185"/>
Here our Author leaves off, nor as I can find, ever reassumed this Subject; and
though possibly some Persons may imagine that the foregoing Explication of
these abstruse Actings of the Soul it too mechanical, and tends to the making
the Soul a material Being, yet I hope the candid Reader, perusing it without
prejudice, will not find the least Cause for such an Imputation, it being through∣out
the whole Discourse asserted and shewn to be a Spiritual, Immaterial and
Self-moving Principle; and it is granted by all Men, that it both acts and is re∣acted
upon by Body, only our Author supposes the Pictures conserving the Ideas
to be material, which I hope cannot justly give offence: However, as I have
said in the Preface, I hold my self not in the least obliged to defend or maintain
any of his Opinions or Discourses, but fairly present them to the Ingenious as
be left them. The next that follows is a Discourse of Comets wrote about <HI>Mi∣chaelmas</HI>
in the Year 1682, containing a Physical Hypothesis and Explication of
them, from Observations made of one that appeared in <HI>August</HI> 1680, and on that
very unusual one appearing in <HI>December</HI> the same Year, and the beginning of
the next Year, and on the following in <HI>August</HI> 1682. Wherein, after an Intro∣duction,

<HEAD>THE CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<Q>At the End of the Year 1680. there appearing a very great, and indeed the
most remarkable Comet that the Heavens have shewn us in our Age, the
Author was diverted from prosecuting his Theory and Explication of
Light in the several other useful and necessary Disquisitions relating to
Reftected, Inflected and Refracted Rays; though something of the two
last was formerly publish'd by him in his <HI>Micrography,</HI> p. 47, &amp; 217.
In the present Disquisition, he does not so much relate and confute the
Opinions of others (though there is something of that also) as plainly
give his own Observations of the Appearances, as he viewed them
through several Telescopes, night after night, when he could. By the way,
I must in all gratitude acknowledge, that the Figures relating to this
Discourse were generously communicated by the Ingenious Dr. <HI>Woodward,</HI>
who purchased them, (put in loosely into <HI>Bayer</HI>'s <HI>Uranometria</HI>) at the
publick Auction of Dr. <HI>Hooke</HI>'s Library. Though indeed these Figures
were all very rudely designed, only as Helps to his own Memory, which the
Author himself could much better have fitted for the Graver; yet I have
endeavoured to supply this Defect as well as I was able, and hope the Rea∣der
will pardon the Failures. I think they pretty well answer his Descrip∣tions,
those being my chief Directors in perfecting the Draughts. I need
not be particular in the Contents of this Discourse, the Marginal Notes
which I have added will sufficiently inform the Reader: Therefore I shall
only give same account of what is immediately annext to it, and which
indeed the Thread of the Discourse led him to; that is, a short Treatise
of <HI>Gravity:</HI> For there being a Gravitation of all Bodies to the Sun, it
seemed a difficult Problem (at least according to his Hypothesis of Co∣mets)
to give a reason of the Blaze or Tail's being nearly opposite to the
Sun. We have then here annext a pretty large, and (if I may be allow∣ed
to speak) an ingenious Discourse of <HI>Gravity</HI> or <HI>Gravitation.</HI> The
<PB N="150" REF="187"/>
Running Title will direct the Reader to it. In this he considers the most
known Proprieties of the Celestial Bodies, and having made several Di∣ductions
from Observations, as to the Nature of the Aether, Air, and
the like, in which <HI>in transitu</HI> he explains Thunder and Lightning, assert∣ing
a Levitation, as well as Gravitation (or a receding from as well as
tendenc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> towards the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) having also shewn that the Aether or vast
fluid <HI>Expansum</HI> is the <HI>Medium</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> convey the Motions of Gravitation as
well as Light; he comes in the next place to treat more particularly of <HI>Bo∣dy</HI>
and <HI>Motion,</HI> explaining what he understands by each of them, and then
treating of Motion, says, that the two great Laws of Motion are <HI>Light</HI>
and <HI>Gravity,</HI> and having before treated of the former, he comes to ex∣plain
the latter more particularly, when having shewn that there is such a
thing as Gravity, with the Limits and Proportions of its Power, and
that it exerts it in all Bodies, he comes at last to the Principal Part, the
<HI>Cause of Gravity,</HI> and after the Enumeration of its Proprieties, gives
his <HI>Explication</HI> and <HI>Hypothesis</HI> of the Cause thereof. The Author de∣signed
to have answered several Objections against this his Hypothesis,
but having reply'd to one only, the Discourse ends. To supply this Defect,
I have added some Fragments which I found relating to the same Subject,
which the Reader will find immediately annext. <HI>R. W.</HI></Q>

<HEAD>Of COMETS.</HEAD>
<P>I Have formerly in this Place read several Discourses concerning the Nature
and Proprieties of <HI>Light,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Introducti∣on to the fol∣lowing Discourse of Comets.</NOTE> and have therein explain'd some of the most
wonderful Qualifications thereof. I should have proceeded farther in that
Disquisition, after another Method than what I now take, had I not been
diverted by an extraordinary and unusual Light, which since offer'd it self to
my view, and exacted a more nice Observation and Contemplation upon it;
and that was the Comet in <HI>August</HI> last. This new appearing <HI>Light</HI> caused me
sooner to fall upon the Contemplation of this Subject, than according to my
<HI>intended Method</HI> I should have done, tho' I designed to have come to it hereafter
in its due Place and Order, wherein I design'd also to have given an account of
what I observed concerning those of 1680 and 1682.</P>
<P>THO' the Frequency of <HI>Comets,</HI> and some of them very considerable, has
excited the Lovers of Astronomical Learning to search and find out what
they are; yet I have not hitherto met with any (tho' I have seen and perused
the <HI>Theorys</HI> published by very many Ingenious Men) that has given such an
account of them, as to me seems natural and satisfactory. For tho' these Bodies
seem very heterogeneous, singular, and of a distinct Nature from all the rest of
the Celestial Bodies we contemplate, yet I am very apt to believe, that when∣ever
we attain a true Knowledge of them, we shall find them to be the Pro∣duct
of the same regular Course of Nature. 'Tis true our Knowledge, even
of the most conspicuous, is very imperfect, and not brought to the utmost Per∣fection
of Improvement that the Helps which Nature has afforded us may seem
to require; tho' even then we shall be to seek after divers other Proprieties of
them, which are by other Helps afforded to the Inquiry after the Qualification
of terrestrial Bodies. For whereas we have for the Examination of Terrestrial
Bodies all the Five Senses, for those of the Heavens we have but Two at most,
or indeed (the Information of the second being so very little) but one; and
that is the Sight, the other, <HI>viz.</HI> that of Feeling, being so very little, that 'tis
almost inconsiderable in all, except the Sun. This may be argued from the Ex∣periments
<PB N="151" REF="188"/>
that have been made to find whether the Rays of the Moon convey
any Heat, by the help of Burning glasses, whereby tho' the said Rays have
condensed the Beams above 500 times, and consequently augment their Power
accordingly, yet I could never find the least sensible Alteration as to the heating
or cooling Quality of them; and this try'd, not only by casting them on the
back of the Hand, as on a Part of the Body very sensible, but by throwing them
upon the Ball of a Thermometer made with Air, which would be rarify'd with
the least degree of increased Heat, and condensed with the least degree of Cold.
Whence we may very rationally conclude, that if the Alterations of Heat and
Cold caused by the Rays of the Moon, when full and wholly inlightned, be so
very insensible and inconsiderable, certainly the Influence of the other Planets,
as to the Alterations of Heat and Cold, must needs be very much less: For if
the Sun's Light reflected from a whole Hemisphere of the Moon, which is first
abundantly more near to us than any of the other Celestial Bodies, and so ap∣pears
an illuminated <HI>Area,</HI> which is bigger than the <HI>Areas</HI> of all the other Ce∣lestial
Bodies put together, both Fixed Stars and Planets, does produce no sen∣sible
Alterations as to the Degrees of Heat and Cold, how much more insensible
must the Alterations be which are caused by some other Body, which alters not
in its Light a 10000 part of the Light of the Moon, as those Alterations of
the other Planets will be found to be upon strict Examination? Next, if the
Reflection of the Sun's Light from a Body so near us as the Moon is, in com∣parison
of the other Planets, works no sensible effect, how much less effect must
the other Planets produce, which are vastly much farther from us. Again, if
the Reflection from the Moon, whose Distance from the Sun is much the same
with that of the Earth, produces no effect, how much less significant must be
the Reflection from <HI>Saturn, Mars</HI> and <HI>Jupiter</HI> be, which in the nearest Approach
to the Sun are much further off from the Body of the Sun, than ever the Moon
can be. So that upon the whole, we may conclude, that tho' it cannot be de∣nied,
but that the Celestial Bodies may have some kind of power and effect in
the Alterations of Heat and Cold, yet compared to the Influence which the Sun
hath in that Particular, it may be said to be almost nothing, or at least wholly
insensible. I do not say that the Fixed Stars and other Planets, besides the Sun
and Moon, are wholly insignificant, or without effect, as to the Body of the
Earth; for that, as I shall in another place shew, they may and have all some
Influence; but to be found out by other <HI>Media</HI> than the immediate Senses. But
as to sensible Effects, as to Heat and Cold, I conceive them so subtle and curi∣ous,
as not to be distinguished by the more gross Organs of our Sense in any of
the Planets, nay of the Moon it self, save only of those of the Sun.</P>
<P>So then the Sight being the chiefest Sense that can inform us concerning the
Nature of Celestial Bodies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What the Sight informs us as to Comets.</NOTE> we may next consider what kind of Information
concerning the Nature of Comets this Sense can afford us, and see whether we
can find in all or any of the Authors that have yet written of them, so full an
Account as for this purpose were very desirable, and, as I conceive, might, if
care had been accordingly taken, without much difficulty have been attained.
For my own part, I must confess, tho' I have read and examined a great many,
and consider'd and compar'd them together, to find Answers to those Questions
I propounded to my self concerning them; yet I was so far by this means
from procuring to my self a satisfactory Answer to them, that I was more to
seek after this my Enquiry, than I was before: For I found the Accounts of se∣veral
Historians concerning them so very different one from another in most things,
that I knew not which to rely upon. Which I suppose might be caused, either
from their differing way of observing, or from the difference of the goodness
of their Sight, or for the most part from the differing Hypotheses they had made
to themselves, or been prepossest withal from the Writings or Doctrines of
other Men. 'Twas a longtime that the Opinion prevailed in this Part of the
World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Accounts in Authors satisfactory, and why.</NOTE> that they were nothing but sublunary Meteors tossed and blown to and
fro by the Winds or Motions of the superior Regions of the Air, and the Accounts
we find given of them by Men of that Persuasion to be very suitable to that Suppo∣sition.
So that for all the time that the <HI>Peripatetick</HI> Philosophy and the <HI>Ptolomean</HI>
Astronomy prevailed, all the Accounts concerning them are idle and insignificant
to this purpose, and seem only suited to the Use which they designed for them,
<PB N="152" REF="189"/>
which was to make them only as Messengers, to foretel, by the help of their
own Chimeras and Fancies joined with them, what Alterations were like to
happen in human Affairs, and thence I doubt not, proceeded the strange Shapes
of them which they have painted out unto us of Targets, Shields, Spears,
and Daggers, with Hands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Dragons and Serpents, and such like. A
great variety of which kind of Figures you may find in Authors that have
written concerning them; and you may see a great many of them together in
<HI>Hevelius</HI>'s <HI>Cometagraphy,</HI> most of which, I confess, I look upon only as the Pro∣ducts
of a prejudicate and prepossest Poetick Fancy in the Historians: For of
those five which I have observed, I could not observe any thing like them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Appearan∣ces different from what they make 'em.</NOTE> no
more than I could any of those Figures of them which are delivered to us by
the said <HI>Hevelius,</HI> as Observations of his own: For the Figures of them, which
I observed both with my naked Eye, and with the best Telescopes I had (some
of which I am sure were very good) I found the Appearances of them much of
another kind. And of these Figures I was not assured by the Appearances of one or
a few Observations, but by the Repetitions of them some hundreds of times, and
by changing the Position of the Tube, Apertures, Eye glasses, Posture of my
Head, and the viewing of them with the Right Eye, and sometimes with the
Left, that if those Appearances had been caused by any thing peculiar either
in the Glasses or the Eyes, I might have found them out. And lest somewhat
in the Air or Atmosphere might cause them, I examined them when at a good
hight above the Horizon, and continued ever now and then to observe them,
even to the very setting of them at the Horizon; in all which Observations I
plainly saw and took notice of the true appearing Figure and Shape thereof.
Wherefore this imperfect and differing Account I found concerning Comets,
made me resolve to throw aside all manner of Hypotheses concerning them▪
and to observe them as if there never had been any such Appearance before▪
and to attend wholly to what the Appearances themselves would teach me:
And this I have done in every one that I have yet observed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author's Candidness in Philosophical Matters as∣serted.</NOTE> for tho' I have al∣ready
published my Conjectures, which were grounded upon those Observarions
I had made on the three preceding Comets, yet I did not at all confine my self to
be of that Opinion, or nor to seek farther to inform my Judgment by other Ap∣pearances
I should happen to observe in my future Trials; nor should that at
all have prevailed with me to defend a former Conjecture, that I had owned
such an Opinion to the World, and had brought several Arguments to make
it more probable, fetch'd from other collateral Agreements in the Operations
of Nature. For in things of this nature, where the Informations are but few,
and at best but imperfect, and where a little unheeded Circumstance may be of
great importance in determining the Significancy of it, and where there is
oftentimes so great a Similitude between the Effects produced by Causes and
preceding Circumstances vastly differing, 'twould be a high Piece of Arrogance
and over valuing ones own Judgment positively to assert the true Cause of such
appearing Effects to be this or that, and not another. And therefore as in the
former, so in this, what I deliver as my Opinion, I would have no farther to
be rely'd on than as the Result of my Ratiocination and conjecturing from the
best Information I could hitherto obtain; only I do positively affirm, that the
Observations I here shall mention were made with all the Care I could, and that
the Appearances to me were such as I here express them; and that I do verily
believe that there was no kind of Fallacy in them, but that any other Persons might
have seen the same, had they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eedfully attended what they saw; which to do,
nothing is more advantageous than the present designing and drawing what is
seen, and writing a Description thereof. Now tho' I did in this Enquiry throw
off all Prepossession of other Hypotheses, so as not to be biass'd by them, yet
was I not so unmindful of them, as not to make some good use of them; and
that was, to consider them as propounded by their several Authors, and thence
by Synthetical Ratiocination to conclude what the Appearances ought to be, if
such or such an Hypothesis were true, and consonant to the thing it self, and
thereupon to examine whether any such Appearance could be discovered. To
this end I consider'd those of <HI>Galileo, Hevelius,</HI> and divers others, who ex∣plain
the Blaze or Tail by the Light of the Sun, refracted in the Head, and so
constipated into a Stream, to make the Appearance of that light Emanation
<PB N="153" REF="190"/>
which is on the Side opposite to the Sun; and putting such Suppositions, as if
real, I deduced what must probably then be the Appearances that would follow
from them; and then making Observations a fresh, I inquired whether I could
discover any Appearances that would favour such or such a Supposition▪ But
upon the whole, I must needs say, I found no one Remark that did any ways in∣cline
me to be of such Opinions, though I had many that for the present convinc'd
me, that the Blaze must needs proceed from some other Cause. It would be
too long to recount here the several Hypotheses▪ I did for this purpose consider,
and the particular Remarks I made to satisfy my self concerning them, that
they were not in such Particulars agreeable to the Theory supposed: And there∣fore
I shall rather give an account what the Particulars were which I my self
did observe.</P>
<P>My Observations of the first, which appeared in <HI>November</HI> 1680, were but
few, having the opportunity but of two Mornings to see it, which were the 22d
and 23d of the said Month; at which times being in the dawning Light of the
Morning, and the Air above not so clear, I could not make any certain Deter∣mination
of its Place, but by comparing its Position with the Stars that ap∣peared
near it, of the greater Magnitude: For on Monday Morning, <HI>Nov.</HI> 22d
1680, at half an hour after 6 a Clock, it was almost in the Line that past
through <HI>Spica Virginis</HI> and <HI>Cor Leonis,</HI> but not full so much toward the South;
and its Distance from <HI>Spica,</HI> as near as I could judge by my Sight, for I had
then no Instrument ready, was very near the same with that of <HI>Algorab</HI> in the
Right Wing of <HI>Corvus,</HI> or rather somewhat more. Whence (by the Globe) I
conceive it was about 3 <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Degrees enter'd into <HI>Scorpio,</HI> and about 3½ Degrees
South of the Ecliptick. Its Blaze was but short, but pointed towards <HI>Spica
Virginis,</HI> not directly, but a very little on the South of it. It reached more
than half way towards it, and sometimes by Glances it would seem of the
whole length almost. Its Appearance was but saint▪ as was also that of the
Head, which though it seemed bigger than any Star of the first Magnitude, yet
it had but a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aint, hazy and duskish Light, like the Appearance of a Star of the
first Magnitude, through a hazy or foggy Air. I then viewed it with a six-foot
Telescope, and found the Head of it to appear very large, but very feint, and
though it were considerably brighter in the middle, yet the <HI>Nucleus</HI> thereof was
not so defined as I had seen some of the former, but seemed inveloped in a
Cloud or Fog, not well defined. The Haziness about which somewhat brighter
Middle part, was pretty well defined, and round towards the Sun; but the other
part seemed to spread parabolically, or rather hyperbollically, from the Sun.
The dawning Light increasing apace, and the Air thickning, I had not long to
observe it; however I followed it as long as I could, till it appeared but like a
faint hazy Star with little or no Tail.</P>
<P>The next Morning, which was the 23d, I saw it again; but it was got much
farther into the dawning Light of the Morning, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Air was much more ha∣zy:
It was then got to the South-East of <HI>La<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x Librae,</HI> and by placing it ac∣cording
to its Position to those Stars I could see, I judged it to be removed more
Eastward about 4 or 5 Degrees, than it was the preceding Morning and I con∣ceived
it to move pretty near in a Parallel with the Ecliptick or rather to be
got somewhat more Southward. The Appearance through <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he six foot Tele∣scope
was much the same with that I saw the Morning before▪ and the time be∣ing
very short, the Air thickning, and the Light increasing, I could add no more
Remarks, hoping some other clear Morning would better accommod<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> me;
but though I attended, yet I could not from that time see it again▪ Though by
others I find it was observed a good while before, and by other<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> several days
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
half an hour after Five in the Morning, and by its Distances from <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> and <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Leonis,</HI> taken with an Instrument of four Foot and a half Radius, he found it
then, as he says, in 12 Degrees of <HI>Virgo,</HI> and in two Degrees of North Lati∣titude,
with a slow Motion, having not passed above four Degrees in three
days. Its Tail was then about 30 Degrees long. Sig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> in
<HI>Italy,</HI> on the 19th of <HI>November,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> at 4 Degrees distance from <HI>Spica Vir∣ginis,</HI>
and about the same Latitude with that S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar. He judged <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in 23 of
<HI>Libra,</HI> with about one Degree and half of South <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: Its Tail directed
<PB N="154" REF="191"/>
towards <HI>Spica,</HI> not directly, but a little to the Southwards of it. Its Head ap∣peared
as big as a Star of the first Magnitude, but of a dusky Light, and pale
like a <HI>Stella Nebulosa:</HI> Its Tail was very short, and reached not much more,
than two Degree towards <HI>Spica.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards viewing it with a Telescope 17 <HI>Venetian</HI> Feet in length, he saw
the Head of it three times a big as that of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> which was seen that Night,
only its Figure was not so well and round defined, but of a smoaky dusky Co∣lour
which caused several of those that viewed it to differ somewhat in their
Judgments about this Measure: And (he says) that one thing was very remark∣able,
that he could not in this see any distinct round <HI>Nucleus</HI> more shining than
the rest of the Head, as was plain to be discovered in those of 1664 and 1665,
wherein they were pretty clear, and not without a roundish Termination. But in
this the Light was considerably greater in the middle than toward the Extremes,
but without any certain Boundary, whence it had more the resemblance of a little
illuminated Cloud, than of any thing else, illuminated but with a dusky Light.
This he resembles to the Appearance of Smoak issuing out of a Chimny or
Furnace, wherein there is a great Fire, when seen at some distance in the Night;
for there the Smoak seems to be a kind of Flame tapering to some distance, and
there to vanish. <HI>Note, the Latitude of</HI> Venice is 45°. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7'.</P>
<P>The 21st it was distant from <HI>Spica Virginis</HI> 8°. 28'. the 22d in the Morning
13°, 10'. the 23rd he could not see it for Clouds; the 24th it was distant 23°. 30.'
the 25th it was distant 28°. 13.' From which Observations he concludes its
Longitudes to be, the 21st in 27°. 51'. of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; the 22d in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 2°, 33'. the 24th in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 12°. 52.' the 25th <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 17°. 45'. Its Latitude was South, and it moved al∣most
parallel to the Ecliptick, and seemed to tend towards the Sun, so as he ho∣ped
it might be seen to pass through, or eclipse the Sun: And the straight Line
from the Comet through <HI>Spica Virginis,</HI> passed very near <HI>Cor Leonis</HI> all the
times the saw it. Comparing the Spaces that it passed the several Days which he
saw it one with another, he found it to accelerate in its Motion; for between
that of the 21st and 22d, it passed but 4°. 42'. whereas in the next two Days it
had passed 10° 19°. So that he supposed its greatest Acceleration would be
pretty near its Conjunction with the Sun, which would be on the 28th of the
same Month; and thence he conceived it might re▪ appear, after it had past the
Sun in the Evenings, and be seen for a good while. Which whether it did or
not, I cannot learn from any Place since that time, for I find no mention of any
Comet till the 10th of <HI>December</HI> following,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Observations of the great Co∣met in <HI>December</HI> 1680.</NOTE> when the Tail of a Comet was seen
to rise out of the West South-West, above the Horizon, to a great length, by
some it <HI>Oxford.</HI> And Dr. <HI>Wallis,</HI> at the same Place the Night following, be∣ing
the 11th of the <HI>December</HI> about seven of the Clock at Night, saw the Tail of it
very bright and long, which he judged to be about three quarters of a Qua∣drant
but narrow upwards; the Head of it he judged, by the Position of the
Tail, to be about the Head of <HI>Sagittary,</HI> the Point reached a high as the <HI>Swan,</HI>
but somewhat to the Eastward of the bright Star therein, pointing towards the
Constellation of <HI>Perseus,</HI> from which time forward it was continually obser∣ved.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whether <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were the same with the former <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> No∣vember.</NOTE>
Some are of opinion, that this was the second Appearance of the same
Come<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> after it had past the Sun, though there are more of the contrary Opini∣on
and suppose them to be two differing Comets, and that because of the diffe∣ring
Tendency of both their Motions: The Comet of <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vember</HI> daily increasing
its Latitude to the South, as several of the Observators make it; but other Ob∣servations
make it to be at its greatest south Latitude on the 23d or 24th of
<HI>November,</HI> and that from that time, till it disappeared, its Latitude continually
diminished. But which of the two observed best, I know not; but sure I am,
that the Observations I have hitherto met with of it, are so uncertain, that 'twill
be hard to say which of them is right. However,<NOTE PLACE="marg">NB. This the Author never performed.</NOTE> somewhat more concerning
this matter shall be added hereafter, when I came to speak of the Motions of
Comets in general; for however strange the differing Observations of several
Men, who possibly may not be sufficiently skilful to make the Observations,
and of others who though they may have Skill enough, may yet want fitting
Instruments for that purpose; yet by all that I have obsrved my self, and by
what I have found in the Observations of Learned Astronomers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nature of all Com<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> the same.</NOTE> I conceive they
are all of them of the same kind, and are moved with the same regular Mo∣tions,
<PB REF="192"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="155" REF="193"/>
and for the most part agree in their other Affections and Proprieties. I
shall therefore, by reason that all the Observations I meet with of this first are
but very few, and scarce any one that may certainly be rely'd on, rather <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eave
any further Disquition upon this, and proceed to the Observations and Appear∣ances
of the 2d, the Blaze of which, as I say, began, to be seen the 10th of
<HI>December</HI> 1680, rising up above the Horizon, and on the 11th was seen by Dr.
<HI>Wallis</HI> at Oxford to rise above the Horizon so high as the <HI>Swan,</HI> and was con∣ceived
to come from a Head below the Horizon in some part of the Heaven near
the Head of <HI>Sagittarius.</HI> I find also by Mr. <HI>Cassini</HI>'s Relation of the Comet,
that Mr. <HI>Flamstead</HI> at <HI>Greenwich</HI> saw the Tail of it on the 10th and 11th, a little
after the Setting of the Sun, and took notice, that on the 10th it passed through
the middle of the Constellation of the <HI>Eagle,</HI> and terminated at 3 Stars mark'd
by <HI>Bayer</HI> with <HI>A w</HI> and <HI>b,</HI> and that on the 11th the Tail extended to the extre∣mity
of the Dart. The 12th he saw the Head of it at 4 of the Clock and 40
Minutes, in 5 deg. 9 min of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> with 9 degrees and 4 Minutes of North
Latitude. The same day Mr. <HI>Cassini</HI> saw the Tail of it rising above the Cloud 9
near the Horizon, and appearing bent like a piece of a Rainbow; whose Convexity,
which was sensible, respected the South: It seem'd terminated with two Circles
concentrick to each other: At 24½ Minutes after Five, he saw the Head 4½ de∣grees
high, in the same Verical with <HI>Aquila.</HI> The Tail rose, oblique to the
Vertical, declining towards the North; so that the 3 stars of the <HI>Eagle,</HI> which
are in a right Line, were as much to the South of it, as they were distance one
from another; and it past by the most Western Stars of the <HI>Dart,</HI> and tended
towards the Tail of <HI>Cygnus:</HI> It ended at the Milky Way, and was of a pale
Gold Colour. The Length of it was about 40 degrees. From that time it con∣tinued
to be observed almost every Night somewhere or other, as I find by com∣paring
the several Accounts of it which I have seen; but most of the Observa∣tions
are so imperfect, that nothing certain can be built upon them. I shall
therefore pass them by, and only take notice of those of Mr. <HI>Cassini,</HI> made at the
<HI>Observatoire</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> and only such Observations of his as are Physical, omitting
at present those which are purely Astronomical, and shew the Place and Motion
of it, which I shall have occasion to use hereafter, when I shall also take notice
of the like Observations made here by Mr. <HI>Flamstead.</HI></P>
<P>The 17th of <HI>December</HI> I find that Mr. <HI>Cassini</HI> viewed the Head of it with the
Telescope of his Quadrant,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cassini</HI>'s Phy∣sical Observa∣tions,</NOTE> but found the bigness of the <HI>Nucleus</HI> not to exceed
the bigness of a Star of the 3d Magnitude to the naked Eye; not of a deter∣minate
Figure, but confused and irregular; and observing it through a Tele∣scope
of 35 Foot, it appeared of the bigness of the Ball of <HI>Saturn,</HI> but confu∣sed
also and irregular, which he ascribes to the Vapors near the Horizon which
encompassed it, for that the Bodies of the Planets near the Horizon are so con∣fused
likewise. The Length of the Tail he judged 48 Degrees.</P>
<P>I saw it several times between the 18th and 19th Days of <HI>December,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author's own Observa∣tions. Plate 2. Fig. 1.</NOTE> but in Places
where I had no Convenience of making any good Observations of it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but the 29th
at 7 in the Evening, I view'd the Head with a 14 Foot Telescope, and found it of this
Form: There was a hazy Brightness, which seem'd through the Telescope about half
a Degree in Magnitude, or as big as the Moon would appear to the naked Eye.
This was fainte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and fainter, as it was farther from the middle, but no where
certainly defined; yet the half of it, which respected the Sun, was pretty round,
and beyond that the Sky was dark and clear, without any Light: Toward the
middle it grew lighter and lighter, and about a 6th or 8th part of it was pretty
near of an equal Degree of Light, not defined any way, but somewhat like a
whiter part of a Cloud: Out of this there was plainly to be seen a kind of
Stream issuing out, not directly opposite to the half round Part, but a little to
the Northward of a brighter small Stream, which passed through the rest of the
Head into the Blaze; and though it seem'd to issue out of it toward the
North Pole, yet it suddenly bent into the middle of the Blaze, and ascended a
good way into it like a Pit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. The half-round part also towards the Edges of it,
struck into the Tail, making the Outsides of the Tail or Blaze both brighter than
the rest of the Blaze, except the Pith: These were a little diverging upwards,
and so bounded the Sides of the Blaze. The Stream out of the middle, as it ap∣pear'd
through the Telescope, seemed as if there had been a brighter Stream of
<PB N="156" REF="194"/>
some more shining Matter that had issued out of it, not perpendicularly, but
a little inclined to the Right Hand, and imitated a Stream of Water, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it had
run out of a Vessel a little inclined to the Perpendicular: For it bent quickly in∣to
the Axis of the Blaze. This is represented in the Figure by the bright Part
issuing from the round <HI>Nucleus, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</HI> This appeared sometimes more plain and
sometimes more faint, so as sometimes to be much like the rest of the Blaze:
But for the most part, so much of the Hea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as I could see at once, was brightest
of all in the middle, and then brighter on the Edges than the rest of the Blaze.
Its Blaze or Tail then extended to a very great Length and Breadth, and ended
between the two Stars in <HI>Perseus</HI> marked by <HI>Bayer</HI> with <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. At first it seem∣ed
to turn off at <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> on the Right Hand, or towards the North; but as the
Evening grew darker, I plainly saw it to reach the Stars <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. As concerning
its Place at that time, and the tendency of its Tail as to the Sun, we shall speak of
them hereafter in their due Places: For I shall now only mention to you what I
observed in its Shape and Appearance.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> the 30th, at half an hour after 8, I observed the Comet both with
my naked Eye, and with a Glass of six Foot: Its <HI>Nucleus</HI> was hardly distinguish∣able,
only there was a cloudy Whiteness in the middle, with a hazy Light about
it, which by degrees grew fainter and fainter; but still it was more defined to∣wards
the Sun, yet as before very imperfectly, though the outermost Edge had
somewhat considerably more light than the Sky, and had a rounding like a
Cloud. This Haziness spread from the Head on that Side that was opposite to
the Sun, somewhat like a Parabolick Figure, and made up the Blaze or Tail;
but the Head was considerably lighter than the Blaze. Looking often upon it,
and diligently inquiring, and remarking what I could discover, I saw the same
Stream of Light issue out of the <HI>Nucleus</HI> as I had the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight before, and this in
the manner of a sudden Spouting of Water out of an Engine to quench Fire,
which would presently again disappear, and be much like the rest of the Blaze.
These Dartings I could perceive to rise to a considerable height into the Blaze or
Tail. I often saw the Telescopical Stars through the Blaze, and this Night I
observed one almost up to the very Haziness about the Head of the Comet, ap∣pear
through the Blaze. After I had discovered this issuing of Light through
the Telescope, I diligently attended the Appearance of the Comet with my naked
Eye, and I could plainly perceive such a kind of Darting of Light from the Head,
which did sometimes seem to dart almost the whole Length of the Blaze or
Tail, which I have some hundreds of times since taken notice of.</P>
<P><HI>Jan.</HI> 5. I hoped to have seen it eclipse <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of <HI>Pegasus</HI> in <HI>Bayer;</HI> but it passed
very near it, but missed it.</P>
<P><HI>Jan.</HI> 7. I observed it about 11 a Clock at Night, I could not see the Length
of the Blaze for the Clouds. It tended towards <HI>Perseus,</HI> but seemed not to
reach it. It was grown vary faint, and seemed much wasted. It was very strange
that there appeared little or no Halo or Atmosphere about the Head on that Side
that respected the Sun; but the Parabolick Edge seemed to touch the very <HI>Nu∣cleus</HI>
or light Cloud in the middle. The brighter Dartings out of Light at some∣times
more than at others, now <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> appeared; and I was then assured by
above 20 several times taking notice of it, and examining it with all imaginable
care through my 14 Foot Telescope, that these Appearances were no Optical
Fallacies. I thought the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Air might have been some way a
Cause of this Appearance; but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> I should have discovered some such thing
in the Fixed Stars, which yet I could not▪ And therefore I judge it a true and real
Appearance of the Mutation in the Comet it fell, how instantaneous soever it
appeared▪ of which I shall shew more in my following Observations▪ I this
Night also took notice of the Stream, as before, issuing out of the <HI>Nucleus</HI> into
the Blaze, with a brighter Pith of Axis of Light, and it seemed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in the
same manner as before<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by spurts, and then as suddenly disappearing. The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
were neither caused by the Eye; for I saw it both with the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
the Left Eye, and with several Inclinations of my Head, and so altering the Po∣stures
of each of them, I turned the Telescope, and varied the Glasses and Aper∣tures,
to see if any of these would make them not to appear, or a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
them; but I found them in every Trial, and therefore they must be caused by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
real Effect in the Object i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> self.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="195"/>
<HI>Jan.</HI> 9th, from 9 till 12, I observed the Places, Motions, Positions and Ap∣pearances
of the Comet. The Places of it I shall not mention here. The Blaze
of it was sometimes pretty clear and bright, especially about the Girdle of <HI>An∣dromeda;</HI>
which was just within the Rays to the naked Eye, but through the
Telescope it was sometimes clear of them, though sometimes in the Glass also
it was manifestly within them: They spread also so wide upwards, as to touch the
Foot of <HI>Andromeda,</HI> a little beyond which they seem'd to terminate, though at
other times they reacht even to <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of <HI>Perseus</HI> in <HI>Bayer,</HI> so that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> seem'd to be
in the very middle or Axis of the Blaze. This Night again, as I had several
Nights before, I very often observed the sudden Radiations or Flashings from
the <HI>Nucleus,</HI> but especially in the middle of the Pith or Blaze. It was exceeding
wonderful, and, all things consider'd, it seems very difficult to be explained from
what Cause, or by what means it was effected. I oftentimes observed the Head
with very little Radiations, and then upon a sudden a bright Stream issued from
the <HI>Nucleus</HI> or light Cloud in the middle, and ascended into the Blaze, some∣times
straight up from the middle, and almost as big as the <HI>Nucleus,</HI> and would
shoot sometimes to a good distance from the Head into the Blaze, which I dis∣cover'd
by viewing a part of the Blaze at a pretty distance from the Head, with
the Telescope, without seeing the Head it self. Sometimes it would issue from
one side, and sometimes from another, and so shoot upwards into the Pith of
the Blaze. Sometimes it would be dispersed, as it were, into a broad Light,
and undefined, whilst the other ascended straight, and defined; and that also
sometimes on one side, sometimes on the other, and seemed somewhat like the
flaring of the Flame of a Candle or Torch. These Appearances I am farther
certain were not caused by my Eye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Appear∣ances were real.</NOTE> or by the Glasses of the Telescope, or by
the Alterations of the Air: Not by my Eye, because I saw the same Appear∣ances,
whether I looked with my Right, or my Left Eye, and changed the Po∣sture
of my Head when I looked; sometimes seeing them with my Head upright,
sometimes with my Head inclined horizontal on one side, and then on the other;
and so in all variety of Postures, in which I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>till saw them. Nor were they
caused by my Glass, for I saw them with the same Glass changed with several
Apertures, and turned every way round, so as sometimes one Side of the Tube
was upwards, sometimes another; yet the Appearances were the same, as they
were also through 4 or 5 other Glasses, through which I saw them in the same
manner. Nor were they caused by the Air, for the Fixed Stars near the Head
of the Comet had no such Alterations. Again, if it had been the Alterations of
the Air, the Flashings would have been seen to descend sometimes, and some∣times
to cross the Blaze; but these always issued from the Head, and shot up∣ward
into the Blaze, and never any other way, that I could observe. And I
have hundreds of times observed such Flashings with my naked Eye, darting
from the Head even to the whole Length of the Blaze, almost in a moment.
Besides, when these Flashings ceas'd, as they often did, I could see divers small
Telescopical Stars in the middle of the Blaze very plai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly: Whereas when the
Flashing appeared,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Telescopical Stars seen through the Blaze.</NOTE> they could not be seen for the Light, especially the smaller
of them; and I saw them on the one side that was without Emanation, close
up to the Pith, but on the other side of the Pith that had the Light Emanation,
I could not perceive them, and so after a little <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>vice versa.</HI> Sometimes also
I could see them on both sides up to the Pith, in the middle of the Blaze, and
sometimes they would be all hid. This Night I exactly observed its Progresses
among the small Telescopical Stars, to see if I could have found any sensible
Parallax of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Paralax to be observed.</NOTE> but I could discover none.</P>
<P>I took notice of the same Appearances on the 16th of <HI>January,</HI> and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
and 24th but very little, as also on the 26th and 27th.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> the 30th at 11 at Night, I observed the Position of the Comet; and
several other Particulars. I observed this Night also, as I had done several
Nights before very often and very plainly, that the Appearanced was perfectly a
Resemblance of Flame, but that exceeding thin and rari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y'd, and of a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aint
Light: That it waved, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ared, or undulated to and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ro: That it sometimes
seemed to burn clearer and stronger, and sometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
sometimes on one side, and then on the other, and sometimes in the middle <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f
the Blaze also, or in the Part opposite to the Sun: And which I took <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no∣tice
<PB N="158" REF="196"/>
of, as more considerable, it would be sometimes more on the Side next the
Sun, and sometimes less: Sometimee it appeared with little or no <HI>Halo</HI> about it,
but only the <HI>Nucleus</HI> or white Cloud with a little Stream or Blaze issuing from
it like the 2d Figure. At other times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plate 2. Fig. 2.</NOTE> for the twinkling of an Eye, or small
moment, I could see a very small bright Point of Light in the middle of it, as
at <HI>c,</HI> which appeared no bigger than a Telescopical Star, which was very near it,
which immediately disappeared, and seemed to be covered with the white clou∣dy
<HI>Nucleus.</HI> This cloudy <HI>Nucleus</HI> was also much bigger and brighter than at
other times, and sometimes seemed to have several bright Parts in it, as in the
3d Figure at <HI>f.</HI> Every one of these Remarks I observed at least half a score se∣veral
times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plate 2. Fig. 3.</NOTE> and the Changes were very quick; so that I was fully satisfied in
my self, by all the ways of examining I could think of, that these Mutations
and strange Appearances, possibly never, heeded by any before (for I never met
with any mention of them in any Author, or from any Person that had taken
notice of Comets, but only I have been told by some antient Men that saw that
in 1618, that it did perfectly sparkle and shoot forth Fire; but I confess I did
not then give credit to them, but attributed the Cause of their having such an
Idea or Remembrance of it to their having possibly more dreadfull Apprehensions
of it in their younger Years, and also to the great Brightness of the Tail of that
Comet): I say, I was fully satisfied that they were real Mutations in the very
<HI>Phaenomenon</HI> it self. And this I was the more satisfied of, because I had, hun∣dreds
of times taken notice with my bare Eye, of the Glancings and Dartings
out of the Light of the Head into the Blaze; in which 'tis almost incredible
with what Swiftness the Flash or darting of Light passes from the Head to the
very Extremity of the Blaze: For I never, observed the Dartings of the Light∣ning
(which I have often diligently remark'd and computed to move above a
Mile in less than half a Second of Time) to move more swiftly from Place to
Place, than I did see through the Telescope such kind of Dartings from the
Star to move: I mean the actual Flame of the Lightning, and not the spreading
of the Light it self, which I conceive rather to be instantaneous; and though
it do seem to be successive, and to spread in a very quick time from the Center
<HI>in Orbem,</HI> and that the more remote Parts are inlightned after the nearer; yet
I take that to proceed partly from the weaker Impression made by the remote
parts on the Eye, and partly from the Yieldingness of some parts, of the <HI>Medium</HI>
through which it is propagated. Now if this Appearance be really in the Ob∣ject,
as I am satisfied it is, and that this Object be at so vast a distance from us,
as by all the accurate Observations that have been hitherto made for this pur∣pose,
'tis certainly prov'd to be; we shall find by comparing the distance of the
Lightning, with the distance of the Comet, how incredibly much swifter these
Dartings of Light in the Comet will be than the Dartings of the Flame of
Lightning it self: And yet after all, how incredible soever it seem, I am satis∣fied
by my often repeated Observations, that the Matter is really so. It seem'd
to me upon my viewing them often, that 'twas not improbable but that these
Flashes or Sparklings were caused much after the same manner as the sudden
Kindlings of Steams or Smoke in a Fire, beginning at the Head, and kindling
like a Train into the Tail, which may possibly be made up of such a Stream of
combustible rarify'd Parts, and that the whole Light of the Head and the Blaze
was from the actual shining of the stead and the Parts of the Blaze, but of this
more hereafter. However, this I think is very plain, that the whole Blaze pro∣ceeded
and issued from the Head in material Steams,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> and that it is not at all
produced by any manner of Refraction of the Rays of the Sun pasting through
I observed all the same Appearances again the 3d of <HI>February,</HI> and continued to
see them till <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Clock at night; so that I was sufficiently confirmed in
the reality of the Appearance, and that it was not a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Visus.</HI> I observ'd
it again <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the 7th and 9th and diligently set its Place among the
Fixed Stars that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> near it in its way.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> time I saw it was on the 10th of <HI>February</HI> at Night, when I fixed its
Place among the Telescopical Stars, with the Direction of its Blaze, which to
the last all among observed very conspicuous, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this Night also through my
14 Foot Telescope, discover'd all the before recited <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> as before t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'
<PB N="159" REF="197"/>
they were very much fainter and paler, and every thing diminished as to its Vi∣vidness;
so that I did not expect that it would last much longer. However, I
believe I might have followed it for a Fortnight or Three Weeks longer, had
not partly other Occasions, and partly the Cloudiness and Thickness of the Air,
prevented me from seeing it for 7 or 8 days after, till which time I continued
so often as I had Opportunity, to look for it. Mons. <HI>Cassini</HI> it seems, follow'd
it some days longer, till it arrived at the Foot of <HI>Perseus,</HI> where he also lost
fight of it. I do not yet hear that any one has certainly seen it beyond that
time, and Mr. <HI>Cassini</HI> seems not to be very sure of some of his last Observations.</P>
<P>Thus I have given you in short the Sum of what Physical Observations I have
made concerning these Comets, which as they are new, so they may possibly
seem the more strange, for that no other that has writ concerning them, has
mention'd any such Appearances, and for that several Appearances mention'd by
some very famous Writers, seem very differing, if not contradictory to these.
However, what I did observe I have set down, that such as cannot find cause to
believe them from what I have here set down, may by their future Opportuni∣ties
and Observations better inform themselves, and more critically search and
find out the true Appearances, and at least the probable, if not the true Rea∣sons
thereof. For I am perswaded, that there was scarce any Appearance in this
Comet, but may in some degree, more or less, be found in every one that shall
appear for the future; for that I look upon them to be all of the same nature,
and to have all the same Proprieties in some measure; and I shall be content
not to be believed, if making the Observations in my way, and with as good
Instruments, they do not find the like Appearances.</P>
<P>These Observations had still Iain by me neglected, had not the Appearance of
this last Comet in <HI>August</HI> made me find them out; which put me in mind again
of repeating my former Care and Scrutiny after, the true Appearances, thereof.
I did therefore, so soon as ever I had discover'd it, put my Glasses in order,
(which had lain by neglected since that time) and resolved in this wholly to
mind those kind of Observations, for that I hoped I should from other hands receive sufficiently exact Astronomical Observations thereof, of which I shall
afterwards have more occasion to make use, when I come to enquire concerning
the Distance, Course, Velocity, Magnitude and Original of them. And tho'
the Determination and Demonstration of all these do require a great Stock of
accurate Observations purposely and pertinently made, which is hardly to be
obtained from all that have hitherto writ concerning them; yet from such as
they are, I shall shew some Conjectures, which to me seem to have somewhat
of probability in them, which may serve at least as Hints to such as have Op∣portunity
to observe them, and are furnished with better Abilities and better
Instruments than I have hitherto been furnished with.</P>
<Q><HI>NB.</HI> These Astronomical Observations, and our Author's Remarks upon them,
I have not met with amongst his Papers; so that I verily believe he never
procured them, or at least never made any Animadversions, as is be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> men∣tioned.
<HI>R. W.</HI></Q>
<P>But to proceed to the Observations I made of this last Comet, which appear'd
<HI>August</HI> the 16th 1682. The Forepart of the Night being exceeding clear over∣head,
looking upon the Heavens, I discover'd a Comet in the North a little
above the Horizon, glancing its Blaze toward the South-East between some thin
Clouds that were near the Horizon, and presently fetching a six foot Telescope,
and viewing the stead of it, I remarked its Position to some Telescopical Stars
that were near in, and with my naked Eye found the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the
Stars about them; the most conspicuous of which were two little Stars of
the 3d Magnitude, in the Fore Foot of the Great Bear marked by <HI>Bayer</HI> with
<HI>s</HI> and <HI>x,</HI> and 'twas near in a Line with <HI>s</HI> and <HI>T;</HI> 'twas pretty vivid, and through
the Telescope seemed to have a bright and strong <HI>Nucleus,</HI> though small, not
very defined, and the Light or Halo about the Head was much of the Form of
all the other I had seen, when very conspicuous. The Side next the Sun was
pretty round and at a good distance from the <HI>Nucleus,</HI> and the Blaze struck
from it in a Parabolick Figure.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="198"/>
I had not the Opportunity of observing it again till <HI>August</HI> the 20th at 9 at
Night, at which time I took its place.</P>
<P>Through the Telescope it appeared of a shape which is shewn in the Draught
or Picture.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plate 2. Fig. 4.</NOTE> See Fig. 4.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nucleus</HI> was the smallest, but the brightest I have seen; the hazy Light
about it was so much the brighter, the nearer it was posited to the <HI>Nucleus.</HI>
The brightest part of the Head diminish'd to about 5 or 6 Diameters of the bright
Star, as I may call it, in the middle, without which was a thinner <HI>Halo,</HI> which
was about twice as broad without it, which was of a pretty equal Light; and this
towards the Sun was terminated in a rounding Figure, not very defined, yet so
much, that immediately beyond the Sky look'd black, and was clear of it. The
brighter part about the Star or <HI>Nucleus</HI> seemed to spread more or brighter to∣wards
the Blaze than any other way, a little tapering; but the thinner part was
much more spread that way, aud extended about eight or ten Degrees, which
made up the Blaze. This seem'd to be a kind of Smoke or Steam, which ta∣per'd
towards that length from the Sun; so that the brighter part seem'd some∣what
like a thin Flame, and tapering a little into the Blaze, but was soon spent,
and the other thinner part, or Flame, made up all the rest to he Blaze.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 21. I saw it again, and noted its Place, but was diverted by accident
from making Telescopical Observations, and setting them down.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 22. I noted the Position, Shape and Length of its Blaze, but nothing
else.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 26. At 7 in the Evening,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plate, 2. Fig. 5.</NOTE> I delineated the Figure and Shape of the Co∣met
exactly like that I saw through my 14 Foot Telescope, which will appear
more plain by the 5th Figure than I can otherwise well express it. It had a
pretty bright round <HI>Nucleus,</HI> and about that was an Atmosphere of thinner
Light; which was terminated towards the Sun with a round Figure. That part
of this <HI>Halo</HI> or lighter Atmosphere towards the Sun was nor so bright and ra∣diant
as another kind of Light, which seemed to issue from the <HI>Nucleus</HI> or
Star both ways at Right Angles, with the Axis through the Sun; which lighter
Issuings bent into a kind of Parabolical Figure within the former <HI>Halo</HI> or At∣mosphere;
and was terminated within it, and seem'd to form as it were a 2d
Parabolical Termination towards the Sun, in the <HI>Apex</HI> of which <HI>Parabola</HI> was
the bright <HI>Nucleus,</HI> and this brighter Parabolical Line of Light seemed as gross
or thick as the <HI>Nucleus</HI> it self. This issued on both sides, but that on the Right
Hand, or the Northermost, was much more conspicuous; insomuch, that that
on the Left Hand, or towards the South, was to be seen but sometimes, but that
of the other side was very plain and conspicuous, and seem'd like a Stream of
Flame blown out of a Candle by Blowpipe ascending or bending upwards just
as such a blown Flame of a Candle will do, if it be made by a gentle Blast.
This I remark'd very carefully, to see whether I could find by any succeeding
Observations, any Al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eration of the Magnitude, Figure, Brightness or Position
in respect of the Comets <HI>Axis.</HI></P>
<P>These two brighter Spoutings of Flame or Light turned or bent upwards
from the Sun, and after a short space seemed to unite into the <HI>Axis</HI> or Middle
of the Blaze, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Shape of the outside of the Flame of Candle ta∣pering
to a point; the fainter part also without a seemed to taper much in the
same manner. I saw also several <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or Flashings of the
Flame shouting out to a great distance into the Blaze.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="161" REF="199"/>
it made a kind of tapering Light; but the opposite Side was not near so plain
or easy to be seen.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 30. I viewed it again with my 14 Foot Tube, and found its Figure such
as I have described in the Draught. The <HI>Halo</HI> or Atmosphere about the Head,
on that side which was next the Sun, was thinner than the last time I saw it,
not spreading so far that way as then. The Fuse or Stream on the North side
of it was very plain and bright, but seemed not to issue now at Right Angles
with the Axis of the Blaze, but, as it were, at 45 degrees with it, and then bent
into the Blaze with a kind of Parabolick Figure, and so ran Parallel with the
Axis to a great length, and did not taper in towards it, as on the 29th. The
issuing on the opposite side was hardly at all visible, only it seemed a little bright∣er
in that part, than in the middle part of the Blaze near the Head.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 31. I took its Place and the Direction of its Blaze by the 14 Foot Tele∣scope.
The bright <HI>Nucleus</HI> appeared much as it had done the preceding Nights,
and the Fuse Stream of Light had much the same Inclination to the <HI>Axis</HI> as
last Night, only it seemed now to run farther parallel to the <HI>Axis</HI> into the Blaze.
The Haziness of the Head about the <HI>Nucleus,</HI> on that side which was next the
Sun, was now much thinner and nearer to the <HI>Nucleus,</HI> and pretty well defined.</P>
<P>There was a little Emanation answering to it on the Left Hand, but that was
exceeding faint; yet the Sides were brighter than the middle part near the <HI>Axis.</HI>
I saw the flaring of the Light, and the Corruscation, as I had done almost every
time I saw it. The <HI>Nucleus</HI> was not a tenth part of the bigness of the <HI>Halo</HI> or <HI>Haze</HI> about it.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> the 1st, I viewed it again with my 14 Foot Telescope. I could see
no small Stars near it; the Fusee or Stream of Light appeared much as it had
done the two preceding Nights. I still plainly saw the Flaring or Flashing of
the Light, and sometimes also saw a Shooting or Spouting as it were of Light
from the <HI>Nucleus</HI> directly into the Blaze, which as quickly disappeared.</P>
<P>I began to see it <HI>September</HI> the 4 at 7½, the <HI>Crepusculum</HI> being yet very bright.
The <HI>Nucleus</HI> was pretty clear and round, but the Blaze from it was only two
Emanations of a kind of Parabolick Figure on each side, as in the Figure; but
the Northern Side was brighter than the Southern still, and they seemed to
spread one from another with an Angle of about 60 Degrees, so far as I could
see them then: for they extended but a little way from the <HI>Nucleus.</HI> The
middle part of the Blaze between them was hardly visible. But as the <HI>Crepus∣culum</HI>
diminished, it appeared much brighter and fuller, and then I could see
its Light also in the middle part of the Blaze. Scarce any <HI>Halo</HI> between the
<HI>Nucleus</HI> and Sun appear'd, at first, and but little more when it appear'd brightest.
I observed also the flaring or flashing of the Light, and a kind of moving of the
Fusee on the North side. It was at its brightest about 8, when I observed also its
Positions. I followed it with my Telescope downwards towards the Horizon near
half an hour after it disappeared to my Sight; and I was able to see it almost
to the very Horizon, even till it went behind a Steeple a little above the tops of
the Houses, though the Smoke much thickened the Air. As it grew lower and
lower, the Blaze disappeared by degrees, and at length also the Haziness about
the Head; so that I could not see the two Streams, but only now and then by
glances; but the <HI>Nucleus</HI> it self I saw very plain, but very much smaller than
before, and seemed about the bigness of <HI>Oculus Tauri,</HI> but very dull and faint,
in comparison even of the small Fixed Stars which were not far from it.</P>
<P>The Figure of it when brightest this Night, was much of the shape of the
Flame of a Candle close snuffed, the <HI>Nucleus</HI> representing the End of the Snuff;
tho' that in a Candle so order'd looks perfectly black, but the <HI>Nucleus</HI> was very
light.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 8. I saw it from 7 1/2 till almost 8; I took notice of its <HI>Nucleus,</HI> and of
the Emanations on each side, as also of the flashing and flaring of the Light.
The Beams were darted on each side parabolically, and seemed at first almost
like two Sides of an equilateral Triangle, but when it was clearest they were
much longer. The Clouds near the Horizon hinder'd me, that I could not see
it till 8.</P>
<P><HI>Sept</HI> 9. at 7 h. 28 m. I saw it perpendicularly over the top of <HI>Bow</HI>-Steeple;
it was 3 <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imes the length of the Dragon above the top of it. The Fusee of Stream
<PB N="162" REF="200"/>
seemed just above it in that posture, as if it had been the Blaze it self bended,
the opposite side being so faint, that I could only now and then perceive it. The
Blaze was at Right Angles with a Line from <HI>Arcturus</HI> through the Head. I
saw very plainly now also the flaring, flashing and wavering of the Light. I
continued to observe it and make my Remarks till it almost toucht the Horizon,
though the Air was very smoaky near the tops of the Houses.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 10. I first discovered it with a 4 Foot Telescope, at 7 1/4. It appeared
very faint: There was nothing besides the <HI>Nucleus</HI> and the Parabolical Edges
of the Blaze, or the two Emanations from the <HI>Nucleus;</HI> the Northern side was
still the brighter and longer. It was very much smaller and fainter this Night
than Yester-night and yet the Sky clearer and darker. I could not find any
Fixed Stars near it through the Telescope, nor could I see any Stars with my
Eyes, the Sky being very cloudy all above it, it just appearing under and be∣tween
several Clouds: Nor could I, nor I believe any body else, see it now with
his naked Eye; and yet through my 14 Foot Telescope I perceived very plainly
the Streams, with the Flaring, Flashing, and sometimes a perfect Lightning,
as it were, in the parts of the Blaze pretty far distant from the Head; which I
6 or 8 times took notice of to be almost in the very <HI>Axis</HI> or middle of the Blaze.
I by many trials this Night also satisfied my self that these Appearances were
no Delusions of the Sight, but proceeded from real Mutations in the Body
it self.</P>
<P>Since which time I have never been able to make any farther Observations of
it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Explication of the Appear∣ances.</NOTE> by reason of the cloudy thick Air.</P>
<P>Now by all these Observations it appears very evident to me, that a Comet is
a Body most probably round, situate in the middle of that part we call the <HI>Nu∣cleus,</HI>
or the brighter part in the middle of the Head, which is inveloped by a
kind of Atmosphere of thick Clouds or Smoak: That a lighter or thinner kind
of parts, like Vapours, spread from it to a much greater distance, possibly
8 or 10 times as far towards the Sun, which by their Limitation in respect of
the Sun, are driven back again, and return upwards, and opposite to the Sun.
Of these kind of Emanations there seem two sorts: One that goes to a greater
distance, and is but very fine and thin, which makes the outmost Edge of the
<HI>Halo</HI> about the Head, when the Comet appears biggest and brightest, and is in
its nearest Approach to the Earth. The other, which is a thicker and grosser,
which descends not so far towards the Sun, but is possibly more firey, and so
recoiles upwards sooner, and makes the Parabolical Emanations that appeared
on both sides of it. The biggest and brightest of which was that towards the
North, or that part, which was the hindermost in its way of Motion, the Fore∣side
thereof being very thin, and but at some times visible; whereas the other
was always very conspicuous. As it went farther and farther off from the Earth,
so the thinner part more and more disappeared (which was very visible when it
it was in its nearest Approach): So that all the time I saw it in <HI>September,</HI> the
second or thinner <HI>Halo</HI> disappeared;, which I suppose was caused, first by the
greater distance of it from the Earth, and secondly the Light of the <HI>Crepuscu∣lum,</HI>
in which it was always placed. And this I judge, because even when it
was much more visible, if I viewed it pretty early before the Day-light was
much spent, I could only see those two Radiations from the <HI>Nucleus,</HI> without
seeing the thinner <HI>Halo</HI> about the Head; which yet I saw afterwards when the
Evening was darker, which I several times took notice of, and which did recon∣cile
what I had obeserved concerning the differing Appearance of other Comets
towards the latter end of their Appearance.</P>
<P>The white Cloud about the Body, which I call the <HI>Nucleus,</HI> I take to be
somewhat analogous to a thick Smoak or Steam, before it was fired, which only
inveloped the firey Body in the midst of it, which I take to be the Solid, through
which I very often perceived a sudden small bright momentary Glance of Light,
which I conceive was either the bright Body in the middle, or else some kind∣ling
of the Smoak or luculent Flame about it; but I rather took it to be the for∣mer.
The two Emanations I take to be the under Edge of the actual, though
thin Flame, which, as I have noted, did perfectly resemble the Shape of the
Flame of a Candle tapering above the Comet towards the <HI>Axis,</HI> and sometimes
meeting in it pretty near the Head, though at other times it were prolonged to
<PB N="163" REF="201"/>
a much greater distance, and seemed to ascend almost parallel. The thinner
hazy part without this, which made up the Head, and a great part of the Blaze
or Tail, I take to be a kind of Halituous Substance, that did not actually kindle
into Flame, but appeared by the Light of the Sun, and in part also by the
Light of the Comet it self, that is, of the shining Cloud or luculent Flame.
The sudden Flashings I so very frequently saw, I think are evidently a certain
kindling of some parts within the compass of the Flame, which like Lightning,
the one End of them near the Comet taking fire, a whole Train of them fol∣low,
as one may also commonly see in the Flame of a Fire. The flaring of the
Light, now on one side, and then on another, I take to proceed only from the
nature of the Emanations, which sometimes proceed on one side, and sometimes
on the other, which are more apt to take fire and turn into Flame. The sudden
Dartings out of Light, which seemed to extend, to the naked Eye, even to the
whole Length of the Blaze, I take to proceed partly from such a kind of kind∣ling
as I just now mentioned, and partly also possibly from a temporaneous Pro∣pagation
of Light, which, as I shall afterwards shew, in a yielding or springy
Body, is temporaneous, and not instantaneous. So that possibly some such sud∣den
Glance of bright Light, which I often saw break through the middle of the
<HI>Nucleus,</HI> might be propagated to the reflective parts of the whole length of the
Blaze, and so be reflected successively; which is otherwise so exceeding rapid
and quick, that considering the vast length of the Blaze, it seems unconceivable
how it should be moved: For the quickness of Lightning is nothing to be
compared to it, though by many Observations I have seen it move near a Mile
in a quarter of a Second Minute of Time, but this must necessarily move many
thousands of Miles in a shorter time.</P>
<P>To conclude, all the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> did so perfectly resemble the Appearances of
a burning, flaming and steaming Body here in the Air near the Earth, that so
far as I can yet inform my self, I see no reason to doubt, that it is a Body qua∣lified
much in the same manner as a Body on fire, or burning in the open Air
with us. Though if Fire be only a Dissolution of a Body by the nitrous part
of the Air, it may seem pretty difficult to explain how there should be any Fire
in those Places through which Comets have been observed to move. Next,
though the Existence of somewhat analogous to Fire and Flame, should be
shewn probable in Comets, and in the Places through which they pass, yet it
may seem difficult to conceive how the Flame and Steams thereof should chiefly
issue and move towards those parts of the Space that are farthest off from the
Body of the Sun; for so it has been observed to do by all the latest and best Ob∣servations:
And thence it has happen'd, that almost all that have written more
particularly concerning them, have explain'd the Appearance of the Blaze,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That Reflection and Refraction of the Sun∣beams are in∣sufficient to ex∣plain the Ap∣pearances.</NOTE> not
by a Matter issuing from the Head of the Comet, but by a certain Collection of
the Sun Beams made by a Refraction of them in the Head of the Comet; some
without any consideration of a denser Matter fit to reflect those Rays so col∣lected
back to our view; though there be some others, among which is Mons.
<HI>Hevelius,</HI> that have seen the necessity of such a reflecting Matter, besides the
meer Refraction of them in the Head. But in short, I have not yet met with any Hypothesis of that kind that has given such an Explication of the manner
of those Reflections and Refractions, as will accord with the visible Appear∣ances
that any one that will be diligent and circumspect may easily observe. For
taking Refractions and Reflections to be made as they suppose them, and con∣sidering
what the Figures of the Appearances must then of consequence be, they
will be found exceeding different from what they really are, and will give no
satisfactory Explanation to a strict Enquirer. Leaving therefore the further Exa∣mination
of these Hypotheses to their Assertors, or to such as may think them
to contain somewhat more of probability than what I am here willing to allow
them; I shall rather proceed to the consideration of that Hypothesis
which the Observations I have made do more incline me to embrace. Now though I con∣sess
there may at first considering of it appear several, and those no ordinary Dif∣ficulties
in this my Supposition, yet when I have a little further explained the
Reasons and Causes, which I conceive of the Celestial. Appearances, they may
appear to have somewhat more of probability than possibly some may imagine.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="202"/>
The greatest Difficulties that I conceive in this Hypothesis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Five Difficul∣ties in this Hy∣pothesis.</NOTE> are Five, namely,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> If the Comet be a burning Body, or a Body in dissolution, how comes
it, that it can supply so vast a quantity of Flame of steaming Emanations, as to
form an Appearance of so prodigious a bigness and length, as those of necessity
must be which have been so often and so exactly observed; as in those, to instance
in no more, which were observed by all the Northern World in 1618, and late∣ly
in 1680, and yet notwithstanding, last, without a sudden and total Disper∣sion
or Consumption of that exceeding small Body in the Head, from whence
they are supposed to be all supply'd.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Next if the Blaze of Comets be from the Head, and that the Comets
are Bodies which are moved with a pretty swift Motion through the Spaces
of the <HI>Aether,</HI> how comes it to pass that this Flame or Steam does not follow after
or point directly to the way through which the Head or Body it self has past?</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> If the Blaze be in part an actual Flame, and the Head be a Body
actually on fire, or in a State of Dissolution, and that all the Fires and Flames
we know have need either of actual Nitre, or of a Nitrous Air to make them,
which being satiated, the Fire or Flame will no longer continue; without a far∣ther
Supply either of actual Nitre or Nitrous Air; how comes there to be either
such a quantity of actual Nitre in the Body of the Comet, or of Nitrous Air
in the <HI>Expansum</HI> in which the Blaze is observed to extend, and yet neither the
Head of the Comet be supposed a terrestrial Body, nor the Nitrous Air be sup∣posed
to extend beyond the Limits of the Atmosphere about the Earth, which
those that have given it the greatest Extension, do assign to be not above 50
Miles above the Surface of the Earth and Sea, and those others that think this
too great, will not allow it to be a 5th part of that height?</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Supposing there could be found a Reason or Cause, why the Body
of the Comet should be supposed to contain some such Substance as Nitre, and
that there might also as probably be supposed such a Substance dispersed through
the <HI>Aether,</HI> as would produce a Flame like that of a Candle, or other flaming
Body here in the Air; yet what Cause can be assigned why it should not equally
disperse it self every way from the burning Body, as we find Flame here with
us to do every way from the Center of the Earth? And why does it always
extend it self towards that part of the <HI>Aether</HI> only that is farthest off from the
Sun in respect of the Head of the Comet?</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> If this Appearance of the Blaze were an actual Flame, yet how should
it be possible, that it should continue a Flame so long, as to extend to so vast a
length, as possibly of some hundred thousand, nay of some Millions of Miles,
and not be extinct in some very short Space, as the flaming Parts of Bodies here
with us are observed to be, which are suddenly kindled and converted into Flame,
and that Flame as suddenly wasted and dispersed, as indeed every part of the
Flame we see of a Fire or Candle is? For though the Flame of a Candle
seems to last till the whole Candle be burnt out, yet 'tis not really two moments
the same Flame, but the parts of the Flame are every moment annihilated, and
others in the same place every moment afresh supplied from the Steams that are
continually issuing out of the Wieke. Now it seems inconceivable how it should
be possible, either that Steams should be carried to so great a distance, or that
Flame should last so long a Journey, as from the Head to the utmost Extent of
the Blaze.</P>
<P>These and some other Difficulties there are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Explication continued, to prove the Au∣thor's Hypo∣thesis.</NOTE> which when one has well con∣sidered,
of the vast Distance of them, even when nearest to us, which all the
accuratest Observations do most manifestly evince, and consequently the exceed∣ing
Magnitude of their Body, and prodigious Extent of their Blaze, and as a
consequence of these, the great Swiftness of their Motions, 'twill be enough
to startle one, and make one despair of ever being able to render a true Expli∣cation
<PB N="165" REF="203"/>
of the Causes of these Effects. And 'tis very apt to make several Per∣sons
to have recourse to an immediate, extraordinary and divine Power acting,
not according to the general Laws and Methods of the rest of Nature, but ac∣cording
to a singular and particular Determination of that Power for the exhi∣biting
those Appearances extraordinarily to Mankind: Whence some ascribe them
to the miraculous Power of good Angels immediately directed by the Will of
the omnipotent Creator: Others (of which we have lately a Treatise on pur∣pose,
upon the accsion of the great Comet in 1680.) to assert them to be pro∣duced
and moved by the Power of Evil Spirits of Devils. But these, as the
Subterfuges of Ignorance, and the want of Industry, we leave to their Asser∣tors.
And though I must confess it to be a very difficult Attempt to manifest
and demonstrate the true Theory of them, yet I shall endeavour from that small
Stock of Observations I have hitherto met with, and those Imperfect and mean
Helps I have hitherto had, to shew at least a probability, what they are, and
how moved, and that they may be same such kind of Bodies as I conjecture
them to be; and that in many Proprieties they may be consonant and agreeable
to the other Celestial Bodies. Now to do this as it ought, one should be ac∣quainted
with what those Proprieties are, which may be known of any other
Celestial Bodies: For if they be found agreeable in those, we may more ratio∣nally
suppose a further Agreement in other unknown Properties.</P>
<P>Now there seem to be but two sorts in general of Celestial Bodies, and those
are either fluid or solid. By solid I understand all those Bodies that appear, and
are made sensible to us, either by their own Light, or by the Light of another
Body reflected from them. So that these Solids do seem of two kinds, that is,
either Bodies appearing by their own Light, or Bodies appearing by the help of
some other Light. And possibly the Comets may be a third sort, that is, such
as appear partly by the help of their own Light, and partly by the help of
other Light reflected from them.</P>
<P>The fluid parts of the World I here suppose of two kinds, that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Fluids of two kinds.</NOTE> one whose
Parts are some sort solid, and may have determinate Figures, Magnitudes and
Motions; and the other, which hath no one Part that may be called a Solid,
but its Parts are infinitely or indefinitely fluid.</P>
<P>The first I call the Een-fluid, or almost-fluid <HI>Aether;</HI> the second, the quite
fluid <HI>Aether.</HI></P>
<P>The former part of this Division of Mundane or Aethereal Bodies, I suppose
is easy enough to be understood and granted: And the second, though it seems
a meer Chimera, and without real ground in Nature, yet by those Observations
and Experiments I shall afterwards produce, I hope it may appear, at least to
be possible, though there may be no one found than can positively demonstrate
it to be so, and not otherwise.</P>
<P>And this possibly may be the utmost that Man's Senses and Reason will ever
inable him to perform,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The most that Man's Sense and Reason will enable him to perform.</NOTE> in the acquiring of the Knowledge of such Causes,
Principles and Operations; the Method and Instruments wherewith they work
being far removed beyond the reach of our Senses: And therefore the best and
utmost we can do towards the discovery of them, is only accurately to observe
and examine all those Effects produced by them, which fall within the Power
of our Senses, and comparing them with like Effects, produced by Causes that
fall within the reach of our Senses, to examine, and so from Sensibles to argue
the Similitude of the nature of Causes that are wholly insensible. And this is
the utmost Bound and Limit of our most exalted and regulated Reasoning,
beyond which that Power cannot carry us. We may therefore rest satisfied with
what that will furnish us; and 'twill furnish us with a great deal, and far
more than possibly any one has thoroughly shewn and demonstrated, or perhaps
so much as ever conceived it could, if a right Method be followed in the mak∣ing
of Observation pertinent, and of using them so as they may exert their
utmost Power toward producing the Discovery. The Power of Man's Facul∣ties
in this kind, has not, I fear, been sufficiently thought upon, much less dis∣covered,
and all that has been hitherto produced seems rather to be some lucky
hits of chance, then the necessary Products of a regular Art grounded upon the
une<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Indications and Dictates of Nature. But this only by the by. I
return then to the Explication of the Comet, and in order to the removing
<PB N="166" REF="204"/>
those Difficulties that I have named, and some other, it will be necessary to
consider what are the most known Proprieties of the solid Celestial Bodies, to
see how far this Body, we are considering,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Answer to the former Difficul∣ties.</NOTE> will agree or disagree with them.</P>
<P>All solid Celestial Bodies then have two Proprieties;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Solid Celestial Bodies.</NOTE> first a Faculty of emit∣ting
or reflecting light; secondly an Orbicular Figure.</P>
<P>The Sun and Fixed Stars, by the best Observations I can yet make,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. They have or reflect Light.</NOTE> seem to
have the Power of emitting Light, the Planets, both primary and secondary,
of reflecting the Light cast upon them from other Bodies; among which the
Earth may be reckoned for one. This most certainly does, as well as the other
Planets, reflect the Light of the Sun; one Evidence of which is the inlightning
of the Moon thereby, when it is near the Conjunctions.</P>
<P>The second Propriety of their Orbicular or Spherical Form,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. They are Or∣bicular, and thence have a Gravitation to them. These the two chief Principles in Nature.</NOTE> is an Indication
of another active Principle, which I conceive universal to all solid Bodies in
Nature, and that is, of a Gravitation or Power of attracting similar solid Bo∣dies
towards their Centers. Which two Principles I take to be the most con∣siderable
and the most active in Nature, and those from which the most conside∣rable
Effects are produced; and when they are understood and explain'd as they
ought, I question not but that they will afford us Solutions and Reasons for a
1000 <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> the Explication of which do now so much puzzle and per∣plex
us.</P>
<P>Concerning the first of these I have already pretty largely discoursed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In his Lectures of Light.</NOTE> and ex∣plain'd
thereby the manner of its Production and Propagation, and what Effects
are thereby produced; how it comes to produce Sensation in the Eye, and how
it causeth Heat, Rarefaction, Liquefaction, Ignition, and the like; and some∣what
also I have mentioned concerning the Refraction, Reflections, Inflection,
deadning and quickning of the Radiations thereof; as likewise of compound∣ing,
dividing, and variously blending of them in the Production of Colours.
But I shall not now farther enter upon the Explication of them, reserving them
to some other parts of my Discourse, which are yet behind, concerning the Na∣ture
of Light. That which I have at present to consider, is rather how Light
comes to be produced in the Head and Blaze of Comets.</P>
<P>Now these Bodies being so far removed from our reach, and appearing so sel∣dom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How Light is produced in the Head and Blaze of Comets.</NOTE>
and the Helps we have hitherto met with affording us so very little that is
to this purpose, I hope it will not be expected that I should be able to bring such
powerful Arguments as may not be at least doubted of, if not positively contra∣dicted.
I confess my great want of such; however, I find from those few
Observations 1 have made, some Arguments that do much incline me to think,
that what I have conjectured of them is very consonant to the appearing Effects
of them, though in every Particular it does not so exactly agree.</P>
<P>First then for my first Supposition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ist Supposition, that there is a dense bright Body in the <HI>Nucleus.</HI></NOTE> that there is in the middle of that white
cloudy part near the middle of the Head, which we call the <HI>Nucleus,</HI> another
more dense and bright shining Body than what is ordinarily taken notice of; I ar∣gue
from two Particulars. The first is, that I hundreds of times have taken notice
of some short and momentary Appearings of such a Star like Spot, as I have
mention'd in my Observations; which is almost an ocular Demonstration; I say
almost, because possibly it may be said, that those were but (like some of the
rest,) Flashings or Kindlings of some parts of that Cloud of Smoak. And I
confess I was often of that opinion my self, when I compared them with the
other Flashings and Spoutings of Light I have mention'd: But then when I
consider'd the second Argument, that there must be somewhere a very solid Bo∣dy,
otherwise it could not be moved with so swift, and so regular and uniform a
Motion, as all Comets that have been accurately observed, have been found to
do; I conceived there was more likelihood to conclude, that it might be some
part of the Star it self through some Chasms in the smoaky Atmosphere. For
unless there were some such Body, 'tis not to be imagined, that a Cloud, such
as <HI>Hevelius</HI> has supposed, should be able to be moved so vast a Space so regu∣larly,
and with so swift a Motion; nor that it should be able to afford Matter
enough to make and supply so vastly big and long-extended a Blaze. For there
cannot be allowed to it an <HI>Aether</HI> moving along with it, in which it should
swim like a Cloud in the Air, or Froth on the Water: For if so, how could
<PB N="167" REF="205"/>
that in 1664 go Retrograde, and quite contrary to the Motions of the Heavens,
if it passed between the Earth and <HI>Mars,</HI> as I have several Arguments that make
me believe it did? Nay, how could all of them move Retrograde to the Mo∣tions
of the Planets, which I hope 1 may shew some Arguments to prove?
Those that hold solid Orbs, will afford it no room, nor those that hold <HI>Vortices.</HI>
Those indeed that suppose Demons, may suppose what they will, but to little
purpose.</P>
<P>Next, unless there were some very dense and very violently burning Body
somewhere in the Head, it could not afford so vast a quantity of Steams, Smoak,
Vapours and Flame, as must necessarily go to the making up of so vast a Blaze,
which is not a constant abiding Body like a Cloud; but, as I manifestly disco∣vered,
rather of the Nature of Smoak, Steams, and Flame, from a burning
Body, which are continually in a State of Dissolution and Wasting, and are con∣tinually
supply'd by some Fountain or burning Body in the Head; and this Bo∣dy
can be no where placed but within the cloudy <HI>Nucleus.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, if there were not some such Body within the cloudy <HI>Nucleus,</HI> the
Roundness of that side of the Head, that is next the Sun, could not be, nor the
greater Density of the Light about and near it: For we see that Clouds and
Smoak, and the like unconjoin'd Bodies, have irregular difform Shapes; but the
solid Body in the middle must be that which made the uniform Roundness thereof,
as I shall afterwards more fully prove, when I come to explain the Nature of
that other universal Principle, Gravity, in the process of my ensuing Discourse.</P>
<P>But (which seems to make the thing yet more probable than all the other
Arguments) I have made a Ball of combustible Substances mixed together,
which being suspended by a Wire in the open Air, and there kindled, would so
very well represent all the Appearances in little to the Sight, that the very Re∣semblance
thereof seems to be a very perswasive Argument, that the Effects and
<HI>Phaenomena</HI> of both were produced from like and homogenous Causes. And
since the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the Ball are produced by the Fire, and by the Gravita∣tion
towards the Center of the Earth of the ambient <HI>Medium</HI> of the Air, it
seems not incongruous to conclude, that the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the Comet may be
produced by a solid combustible Ball actually fired, and by a Gravitation of the
ambient <HI>Aether</HI> towards the Center of the Sun. But I know it may be said, that
<HI>Omne simile non est idem:</HI> And I will readily grant, that it is not a positive Proof,
however 'tis possibly as positive as the thing it self will bear: For in a Subject
where we cannot obtain such sufficient Proofs as we can desire, we must be con∣tented
with what we can obtain. And let me add this Consideration, that all
the Theorys of the Heavens and of Celestial Bodies, we have hitherto had,
are subject to the same Objections that this is; for which of all the Motions of
the Celestial Bodies hath not been explicated by various Hypotheses? Some
supposing the Annual, others the Diurnal Motion of the Earth necessary: Others
suppose neither of them, others only one: Some suppose both the Earth and
the Sun also to be moved; others again suppose neither of them, but that both
the Earth and the Sun may stand still, and only the Heavens of the Fixed Stars
may move round them, as <HI>Cocceus</HI> in his Hypothesis: Others have supposed the
Moon to stand still, and all to move about that, as—: Others have pla∣ced
♄, ♃, ♂, ♀, and ☿, as the Central Body, and solved the Appearances by
supposing all the other to move about some one or other of them: And others,
imaginary Points here or there in the <HI>Aether:</HI> And yet every one of them, grant
them but their Suppositions, will make a shift to solve the Appearances. But
then there will be found so many Inconcinuities in their Suppositions, which yet
will be found necessary to be granted to solve the Appearances, that at first hear∣ing
we reject them as very improbable, and readily bend to that which avoids
them, and hath all things very consonant and congruous: Which is the reason
why the <HI>Copernican</HI> has obtained with all the modern and best Astronomers, against
all the other, as being the most simple, and the least incumber'd of any; especially
as it is improved by the Incomparable <HI>Kepler.</HI> All the Reason of which is from
this Maxim, that <HI>Natura nihil egit frustra, sed frustra fit per plura quod fieri
potest per pauciora.</HI> The Simplicity therefore of the Hypothesis to be granted,
<PB N="168" REF="206"/>
and the Concinuity of it with the known Operations of Nature, is as cogent
an Argument as can be urged for any Hypothesis of this nature, and that I hope
I shall be able to manifest in this I have pitched on.</P>
<P>In the mean time, I shall now only hint, that those visible Appearances of
Comets which I have with much care and circumspection observed and exami∣ned,
with what strictness and unprejudicateness I could, do incline me to de∣duce
them from these following Particulars, which I shall more particularly en∣deavour to prove hereafter.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several Dedu∣ctions from the Observations. 1. The <HI>Medi∣um</HI> must be ex∣ceeding <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hin and fluid.</NOTE> That those Parts of the Heavens through which Comets do pass, must
be a very thin and rarify'd, and an exceeding fluid Medium; otherwise so very
thin a Body as the Halituous Steams about the Head, and especially the more
thin Halituous Steams which make up the Blaze or Tail, could not be moved
through it with so swift a Motion, and that in all Particulars so regular, with∣out
much altering or varying the true Form and Position thereof; Isay, without
much altering and varying the true Form thereof, because, as I shall afterwards
shew, it does really somewhat alter both the Form and Situation of the Head
and Blaze, which would otherwise in probability appear of a somewhat diffe∣rent
Shape.</P>
<P>What I understand by rarify'd and condensed, I shall afterwards manifest,
when I come to the Explication of the Constitution of the <HI>Medium,</HI> that fills the
Spaces between the solid Globular Bodies: For though it freely permits a Body
to be moved through it, it cannot be thence argued, that it contains a less quan∣tity
of Body within the same Dimensions, but only that there is a less quantity
of solid Body, or uniform and united Motion.</P>
<P>Secondly, That there is a Gravitation towards, and a Levitation from the
Body of the Sun: For as I have by many of the Observations shewn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. There is a Gravitation to and Levitation from the Sun.</NOTE> though
there be a Descent of the Steams from the <HI>Nucleus</HI> towards the Sun, yet I al∣ways
plainly saw, that they quickly returned, and went contrary and opposite to
the Suns, and that sometimes to a prodigious Extent.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That this Gravitating and Levitating Power, in respect of the Sun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3. This Gravi∣tation and Le∣vitatton ex∣tends to and beyond the Earth.</NOTE>
doth extend even to the Earth, and beyond it, as will necessarily follow from the
Comet which appeared in the Year 1664, (to instance in no other) For 'twas
evident, that the Motion of that Comet was in a Line, without the Orb of the
Earth; and yet we found, that that Body was regulated in the same manner as
all the other Comets, and that its Blaze was extended in opposition to the Body
of the Sun, and, as I shall afterwards more particularly prove, was moved op∣posite to it.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That there may be a Fire or Flame, and a burning or flaming Body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4. A flaming Body may be beyond the At∣mosphere.</NOTE>
in part of the Heavens far beyond the Atmosphere, nay much farther off from
the Earth than the Body of the Moon it self; and consequently that there may
be other Bodies of the same nature with the Earth, which may be much far∣ther
off from the Earth than the Body of the Moon, nay much farther off the
Sun than either the Earth or Moon: And therefore it may be no great Absurdity
to suppose, that the Body of the Moon may be of a Substance not much diffe∣ring
from the Substance of the Earth, and so may have many Proprieties, if not
the same, yet probably not much differing from it.</P>
<P>Fifthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5. The Power of Gravitation is extended far into the <HI>Aether &amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Ae∣ther</HI> the Caus∣eof Gravitation.</NOTE> That the Power of Gravitation is extended into the <HI>Aether,</HI> without
the Atmosphere of Bodies, and consequently that the Atmosphere or Air is not
the Cause of Gravitation, but rather the <HI>Aether,</HI> in which the Atmosphere or
Air is but a kind of Dissolution, as Salt or Tinctures are dissolved in Water or
other Liquors, and that from thence comes even the Gravitation of the Atmo∣spheres
to their incompassed Bodies; which we observe by many other Experi∣ments
made here upon the Earth: For 'tis evident that Bodies in a Receiver, ex∣hausted
or empried of the Air by means of the exhausting Engine, or any other
ways, have not lese of Gravity towards the Perpendicular or Center of the
Earth, than Bodies in the open and free Air; nay they are found to be propor∣tionably
<PB N="169" REF="207"/>
heavier, by how much a Body of the Air, equal to them in bulk, has
been found to be lighter than them; which is an Experiment that has been often
try'd.</P>
<P>Sixthly, That the Air it self is no farther the <HI>Menstruum</HI> that dissolves Bo∣dies
by Fire and Flame,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6. The Air the Dissolvent of Bodies by Fire, so far as it has a Nitrous Spi∣rit.</NOTE> than as it has such a kind of Body raised from the
Earth, as has a Power of so dissolving and working on Unctuous, Sulphure∣ous
or Combustible Bodies: And this is the Aerial or volatile Nitrous Spirit,
which, provided it be supplied in the Body to be so dissolved, as by Fire, will
work the same effect, even without Air. This is obvious in Compositions made
with Salt of Nitre and other combustible Substances, as in Gunpowder, and the
like, which will actually burn without the help of Air, as may be tried with it
under Water; nay in an exhausted Receiver, as I have often tried, wherein the
Effects are much the same, as if the same Accensions had been made in the open
and free Air; though where this Nitrous part is wanting, no Combustion, Dis∣solution
or actual Fire will be produced, be the Heat never so great. Whence
we may deduce.</P>
<P>Seventhly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7. Two sorts of Particles in the Steams of Comets; 1st A Nitrous.</NOTE> That in the Steams that issue from the Cometical Body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2dly, A Sus∣phureous.</NOTE> there are
two sorts at least of Particles or particular Substances: Namely, first a Nitrous,
such as is every where to be found in our Air, and is perhaps that part which
may most properly be called the Vital part thereof, which supplies the <HI>Men∣struum</HI>
to burning and flaming Bodies; and that which continues the Life, Heat
and Motion of all Animals and Vegetables. Secondly an Unctuous or Sulphu∣reous
Body, that is to dissolved by it. Both which kinds of Bodies may be
actually in the Star or solid Body, which I have supposed placed within the
cloudy <HI>Nucleus,</HI> which may serve to continue the actual Fire once begun, and
may both be rarify'd into the Halituous Steams that compose the cloudy or hazy
Head and Blaze (which Particles, when emitted from the Body, may be sepa∣rated,
and afterwards by convening together again, may produce an actual
Flame) and make those Flashings and Flarings, which I so often took notice of.</P>
<P>That there may be such kind of Effects produced,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Explication of Thunder and Lightning.</NOTE> I would argue from Ob∣servations
which are commonly made here in the Atmosphere near the Earth.
Every one has seen the Lightning and heard the Thunder here in the Air, and
many have endeavour'd to give a Solution and Explication thereof. But though
there be a vast variety of Opinions and Hypotheses concerning it, yet to me they
seem every one of them to have missed the right. I shall not trouble you to re∣late
them here, since I have already declared my Opinion concerning them; nor
shall I at present trouble you with setting down many absurd Consequences that
would follow from such their Hypotheses, which would be quite incongruous
to the manifest, if heeded, Appearances: But I shall only tell you what, from
all the Observations. I have made concerning it, I conceive Thunder and Light∣ning
to be, which whether it be congruous to the <HI>Phaenomona,</HI> and sufficient to
explain them, I leave to the curious Observer to judge. I have shewed already,
that the Atmosphere about the Earth doth abound with a spirituous Nitre, or
Nitrous Particles, which are every where carried along with it; besides which
sort of Nitrous Particles, there are also other Particles raised up into the Atmo∣sphere,
which may be somewhat of the nature of sulphureous, unctuous, or other
combustible Bodies; as we see Spirit of Wine, Spirit of Turpentine, Cam∣phire,
and almost all other combustible Bodies, will by Heat be rarify'd into the
form of Air or Smoak, and be raised up into the Air; all which, if they have a
sufficient degree of Heat, will catch fire, that is, be dissolved and turned into
Flame by the Nitrous Parts of the Air, as thousands of Experiments might be
brought to prove. There are also other sorts of these sulphureous Steams,
which are raised up from subterraneous and mineral Bodies, which only by their
coming to mix with the Nitrous Air (though they have no sensible Heat in them)
will so ferment and act one upon another, as to prouduce an actual Flame; which has been often found in Mines; and more especially if any part of them be kindled, the whole Train of them, intermingled with the Air contiguous,
will immediately take fire, like a Train of Gunpowder, and run from one end
<PB N="170" REF="208"/>
to the other of those Vapours, be they never so long, as I could prove by a Mul∣titude
of Relations from the Cole-mines and several other Mines. The Accen∣sion
of which Vapours is so sudden, and with such violence and swiftness runs
from one end to the other, as often to kill the Miners, to blow up their Props,
Stays and Houses, and do as prodigious Effects as if a great quantity of Gun∣powder
had been fired in the Mine. Now Lightning here in the Air I take to
be much of the like nature, that is to say, the Air or Atmosphere about the
Earth is continually furnisht with the spirituous Nitrous Parts: Now the Heat
of Summer, whenever very extraordinary (as 'tis always Observed to be before
Thunder and Lightning) raises up also out of the Earth a great quantity of sul∣phureous
Vapours, which are of such a nature, as that meeting with the Ni∣trous
of the Air, they work upon each other, and thereby begin a farther degree
of Heat, which increases by certain Degrees so long, till it arrive at a certain
pitch, at which pitch they actually fall on each other, and produce an actual
Fire or Flame, which so soon as ever it kindles, whereever it be placed in the
Train, it almost instantaneously fires the whole Train, and runs to the End with
so great a Swiftness, that though I have observed the Progress of it at three or
four Miles distance, as I have judged by the coming of the Sound to me, yet
have I seen this Train kindle or pass at least a Miles distance in little more than
the quarter of a Minute of time. Now the Progress of the Flashes or Dart∣ings
of Light out of the Comet do seem to be much of the like nature; and
though the Progress of the Flash in the Comets be possibly a thousand times
more swift; yet considering the vast difference there is between the Air and the
<HI>Aether,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">This applied to the Comets fla∣shing.</NOTE> I know not but that the Progress of the Accension of Flame in the Light∣ning
my be accounted as quick through the thick <HI>Medium</HI> of the Air, as that
of the Comet in the thinnner and more fluid <HI>Medium</HI> of the <HI>Aether.</HI></P>
<P>Eighthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8ly, The Mo∣tion of Comets very rapid; therefore they are soild.</NOTE> From the great Distance of the Comets, and the great Variation
of Place they seem to make, we may collect that the Motion of them must needs be very rapid, and to equalize the Swiftness even of the Earth it self, if not
much to exceed it; and consequently to continue that Motion so regular, one
would rationally suppose it must be as solid as the Earth it self; or else that
the <HI>Aether</HI> has very little, if any, impeding Power to the Motion of solid Bo∣dies
through it.</P>
<P>Ninthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9thly, Yet the Parts of the <HI>Aether</HI> are denser.</NOTE> That notwithstanding this, yet there seems to be reason to suppose,
there is a greater Density even of the Parts of the <HI>Aether</HI> it self; for other∣wise
it seems hard to conceive how there should be a Levitation of the flaming
Parts, and a Gravitation in respect of the Sun, of the other more solid, as I
shall afterwards prove more clearly by Consequences drawn, not only from the
Form of their Motion, but from the more indisputable Motion of the Planets.</P>
<P>Tenthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10thly, An Ac∣celeration in le∣vitating Bodies upwards.</NOTE> That there seems to be a vast Acceleration in the Motion of Levi∣tating
Bodies (where the Motion is continued upwards) as well as there is of
Gravitating Bodies, where the Motion is continued downwards, and towards the
attracting Center: For though (as I have before mentioned) the exceeding swift
Dartings and Flashings of the Light do rather seem to be made by a successive
Accension, like a Train of Gunpowder (and, as I have supposed, if not proved,
Lightning); yet to maintain such a Succession of Steams, there must needs be
an exceeding quick Supply from the Head, even to the utmost Extremity of the
Blaze: And it looks not unlike to a kind of actual Levitation, or a driving
outwards of certain halituous Parts from the Sun, as if the Rays of Light of
the Sun were carried with a local Motion rapidly swift, and in their Passage by
the Star of the Comet, did carry with them such kind of halituous or fiery
Steams. The often observing with my bare Eye these sudden Dartings of Light,
which seemed to pass almost in a Second from the Head even to the End of the
Blaze, did often make me consider, whether the Rays of Light might not thence
be supposed to be moved away from the Sun with this exceedingly violent and
rapid Motion; especially since there are some Observations of Mr. <HI>Romer</HI>'s a∣bout
the Eclipses of <HI>Jupiter Satellites,</HI> which seem to make probable such a
Theory: But whether that does well accord with other Appearances, and whe∣ther
<PB N="171" REF="209"/>
it may be allowed in the Theory of Light I have supposed, I shall leave all
Persons free to judge. And as I desire they would give the liberty to satisfy
my self in trying to make a Solution of the Appearances that I have hitherto
taken notice of by some Suppositions of my own, so I shall not endeavour to
persuade any of them to leave their own, or be of my Opinion, where the Ap∣pearances
themselves, that I have mentioned, or they shall observe, shall seem not to make it positively necessary: Since I doubt not but a more experienced,
more thinking, and more judicious Man, may plainly discover what to me is
as yet undetected.</P>
<P>For demonstrating these 10 Particulars I have named,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proofs of the 10 foregoing Particulars.</NOTE> and several others con∣sequential
upon them, I judge it necessary to demonstrate, as plainly as I am able (by the small Stock I have of Observations and Experiments, and some few Deductions I have made therefrom) <HI>Four Particulars.</HI></P>
<P>First, That the vast <HI>Expansum</HI> of the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. The vast <HI>Ex∣pansum</HI> is ex∣ceeding fluid.</NOTE> that is, the whole Interstice
between the greater globular solid Bodies thereof, is a Body exceedingly fluid, and so fluid, as hardly to be able to hinder the Motion of any Solid through it,
much less of a Body of any considerable Bulk or Magnitude.</P>
<P>Secondly, That this exceedingly or indefinitely fluid <HI>Medium,</HI> though it do
not at all, or at most very little, hinder the Motion of Bodies through it, is
yet notwithstanding the <HI>Medium</HI> by which the Communication of the harmoni∣ous
or inharmonious Motions of the more solid Parts and Particles are commu∣nicated to others at a considerable distance; and that by means thereof both the
Motion of Light is propagated outwards, or from the solid Body to all ima∣ginable
Distance in Radiating Lines or Orbicular Pulses, with unimaginable
Celerity: And also the Gravitation or Motion of Descent from all imaginable
Distance towards the Radiating Body, of all solid Bodies, is caused and pro∣duced
by the like Radiating Lines or Orbicular Pulses reversed, with an unima∣ginable
Celerity and prodigious Power.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3. A Body may burn in it.</NOTE> That this indefinitely or exceedingly fluid Body may be, and is a
<HI>Medium,</HI> in which a solid compound Body of proper Materials may be fired
and kindled into an actual Fire and Flame, and may be continued in that State
so long as the said Materials shall last, and other Circumstances do not hinder;
and may have its Flame and Steams ascend, and its more solid Parts descend.</P>
<P>Fourthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4. The Propor∣tion of these Motions.</NOTE> That the Motion of Ascent and Descent herein is continually in∣creased
and augmented in a proportion more than duplicate downwards, and less
than duplicate upwards, of the proportion of the Times; which Proportion
shall be determined and demonstrated.</P>
<P>For the proving, or at least making very probable of which four Proprieties
of so vast a Body, and of the Parts of it at so great a Distance, and of a Body
so altogether insensible to our Organs, any otherwise but by a Series of several
Consequences, it cannot be expected I should produce a sensible and undeniable
Demonstration and yet when the Coherence of all the Consequences, that will
necessarily and naturally flow from this Doctrine and Theory, shall be consider'd,
I hope it may produce other Thoughts and Arguments, in other Mens Minds,
far more cogent than I am able to produce.</P>
<P>Now that I may not be mistaken in my Expressions, and that the Words I
make use of, which are commonly used, but by various Men are understood to
signify various and very differing Notions, I would willingly explain in what
sense I understand them, and what Notions I would willingly have them to com∣municate, when made use of by me.</P>
<P>I conceive then the Whole of Realities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whatever af∣fects our Senses▪ is Body and Motion. Bod<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what.</NOTE> that any ways affect our Senses, to
be Body and Motion. By Body I conceive nothing else but a Reality that has
Extension every way, positive and immutable, not as to Figure, but as to
Quan∣tity;
and that the Body, as Body, is the same, whatever Figure it be of: As a
Quart of Water is a Quart of Water, of a certain quantity of Body, though
contained in a Globe, Cylinder, Cone, Cube, Quart Pot, or any other figured
<PB N="172" REF="210"/>
containing Vessel: And as Body, it is indifferent to receive any Figure whatever;
nor has it more Extension in one than in the other Vessel, nor can it have less;
nor is it more essentially a Body, when solid, as Ice, than when fluid; that is,
the Minims of it are equally disposed to Motion or Rest in position to each o∣ther;
and therefore Body, as Body, may as well be, or be supposed to be inde∣finitely
fluid, at definitely solid; and consequently there is no necessity to sup∣pose
Atoms, or any determinate part of Body perfectly solid, or▪ such whose
Parts are uncapable of changing position one to another; since, as I conceive,
the Essence of Body is only determinate Extension, or a Power of being unalte∣rably
of such a Quantity, and not a Power of being and continuing of a deter∣minate
Quantity and a determinate Figure, which the Anatomists suppose. These
I conceive the two Powers or Principles of the World, to Body and Mo∣tion;
Uniformity of Motion making a Solid, and Difformity of the Motion of
the Parts making a Fluid, as I shall prove more at large by and by.</P>
<P>By Motion I understand nothing but an Alteration, or Power of Alteration,
of the Minims of a Whole,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Motion what.</NOTE> in respect of one another, which Power may be
increased or diminished in any assignable Quantity; but the natural Ballance of
the Universe is reciprocal to the Bulk or Extension, or to the Quantity of the o∣ther
Power, Body.</P>
<P>These two I take to be two single Powers, which co operate in effecting the
most of the sensible and insensible Effects of the World. Of the sensible Ef∣fects
I am ascertain'd by sensible Experiments and Observations;<NOTE PLACE="marg">These two Pow∣ers immutable, but by the Pow∣er that made them.</NOTE> and of the in∣sensible
I have a Probability from the Similitude, Harmony and Uniformity in
the Operations of Nature.</P>
<P>Both these Powers I take to be the immediate Product of the Omnipotent
Creator, and immutable in themselves, without a like Command of the same
Power; and always to act in a regular and Uniform Geometrical or Mechanical
Method; which Method by diligent Observations and curious Scrutiny may by
natural and artificial Means be discovered, and, as I conceive, reduced under
certain Rules, and Geometrically demonstrated. The doing of which I take to
be the true end of the Science of Physicks, or of Natural and Expeimental
Philosophy; and all artificial Inquiries tending hereunto, I conceive to tend
to the Advancement of the Knowledge of Art and Nature.</P>
<P>These are as it were the <HI>Male</HI> and <HI>Female</HI> of Nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Prin∣ciple, Matter.</NOTE> from the Co-operations
of which the most of Natural Productions are effected. The first is, as it were,
the Female or Mother Principle, and is therefore lightly called by <HI>Aristotle</HI> and
other Philosophers, <HI>Materia,</HI> Material Substance, or <HI>Mater;</HI> this being in it
self, abstractly consider'd, without Life or Motion, without form, and void,
and dark, a Power in it self wholly unactive, until it be, as it were, impreg∣nated
by the second Principle, which may represent the <HI>Pater,</HI> and may be call'd
<HI>Paternus, Spiritus</HI> or hylarchick Spirit, as some call it, without whose Con∣junction
nothing, or no Alteration can be produced: For neither can Matter
without Motion, nor Motion without Matter, produce any Effect. As for <HI>Mat∣ter</HI>
that I conceive in its Essence to be immutable, and its Essence being Expa∣tiation
determinate, it cannot be alter'd in its Quantity either by Condensation
or Rarefaction; that is, there cannot be more or less of that Power or Reality,
whatever it be, within the same Expatiation or Content; but every equal Expa∣tiation
contains, is filled, or is an equal quantity of <HI>Materia;</HI> and the densest
or heaviest, or moll: powerful Body in the World contains no more <HI>Materia</HI>
than that which we conceive to be the rarest, thinnest, lightest, or least
powerful Body of all: As Gold, for instance, and <HI>Aether</HI> or the
Substance
that fills the Cavity of an exhausted Vessel, or the Cavity of the Glass
of a Barometer above the Quicksilver. Nay, as I shall afterwards prove,
this Cavity is more full, or a more dense Body of <HI>Aether,</HI> in the com∣mon
Sense or Acceptation of the Word, than the Gold is of Gold, Bulk for
Bulk; and that because the one, <HI>viz.</HI> the Mass of <HI>Aether,</HI> is all <HI>Aether;</HI> but
the Mass of Gold, which we conceive, is not all Gold, but there is an Inter∣mixture,
and that vastly more than is commonly supposed, of <HI>Aether</HI> with it:
So that the Vacuity, as it is commonly thought, or erroneously supposed, is a
more dense Body than the Gold as Gold. But if we consider the quantity of
the whole Content of the one with that of the other, within the same or equal
<PB N="173" REF="211"/>
quantity of Expatiation, then are they both equally containing the <HI>Materia</HI> or
Body.</P>
<P>This possibly may at first hearing seem a little paradoxical, if not absurd;
however I doubt not but that by the Sequel of my Discourse I shall be able to
make it somewhat more plausible, if not positively and undeniably demonstrate
it so to be.</P>
<P>The second Principle or Power, which is <HI>Motion,</HI> is of a quite differing na∣ture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second Prin∣ciple, Motion.</NOTE>
and may be rarified and condensed, diminished or increased, within the
same quantity of <HI>Body</HI> or <HI>Matter,</HI> in any proportion assigned; that is, the same
quantity of the 1st Power <HI>Body,</HI> or part of <HI>Matter,</HI> may receive any assignable
quantity of the 2d, that is, any assignable Degree of <HI>Motion;</HI> and being possest
of it, it may communicate or lose any assignable part of what it has, and still
the Body, as Body, remain unalter'd and the same: For as it may be moved
with any Motion, how swift soever it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e supposed; so may it move with inde∣finitely
slow Motions, and that so far, as that the next step one would suppose
it must lose all its Motion, and remain in intire Rest, and unalterable of Position,
as to the contiguous Body.</P>
<P>It may possibly be still demanded, what is <HI>Matter,</HI> and what is <HI>Motion?</HI> To
which I can only answer, That they are what they are; Powers created by the
Omnipotent to be what they are, and to operate as they do; which are unalte∣rable
in the whole, either by Addition or Substraction, by any other Power but
the same that at first made them to be what they are and what partial Altera∣tions
or Compositions are by them produced, they flow from that Omnipotent
Wisdom, that ordered them so to do: And these are those which we call the
Laws of Nature; which though at first glance they seem wholly unsearch∣able
and incomprehensible, yet God has planted in Man a Faculty by which,
I conceive, he has a Power of understanding and finding out, by and according
to what Order, Rule, Method, or Law, they act, and produce the Effects that
are produced by them. And this I conceive to be that we call Natural Know∣ledge,
and our Advance in this Inquiry, I conceive to be that which we call the
Improvement of Natural Knowledge, and the nearer we can approach from the
lowest and most sensible Effects, to higher and higher Steps of Causes, the near∣er
shall we be to the highest and utmost pitch that human Nature is capable of
arriving at.</P>
<P>I have in my Inquiries various and sundry ways attempted to ascend by
the <HI>Synthetick</HI> Method, and as many ways attempted the contrary, or <HI>Analytick</HI>
way, and shall therefore in some of my ensuing Discourses give some <HI>Specimina</HI>
of each, which though they may have their Failings, and come short of what
may be done by others, yet I hope they may appear to have been regularly and
strictly prosecuted: And this I am now upon, though it should not prove the
true, may yet be of some such use, as the Rule in Arithmetick called false Po∣sition,
for the finding by the wrong Product what is more likely to be the true
one.</P>
<P>Various have been the Attempts of several Philosophers, both antient and mo∣dern,
to begin this <HI>Analytical</HI> way, which would be too tedious to repeat at this
time; yet whether it be for that we have not a true, or at best but a very imper∣fect
Account of what they were, we do not find that Satisfaction from the Pro∣duct
of them in the conclusion, which an inquisitive and strist Examiner would
expect, the String and Series of the <HI>Analysis</HI> being broken and imperfect, and not
carried on through all the Steps of Descent, as it ought to be; which will be
more difficult to supply than the Effect will possibly be valuable, unless we had
a more full Account of what were their first and fundamental Positions. And
though even this has been an Undertaking not left unattempted by several of the
more modern Writers, yet whether such Attempts have been altogether so suc∣cessful
as is desirable, I must leave to those that have examined them to
judge.</P>
<P>Others there have been, and that much a greater number, who have gone the
other way, and have been dabling in this or that particular Subject, and have
been so blinded with some little things they have therein met with, that they
presently square all the rest of Nature to their Rule. Such as these are too
hasty in their Conclusions, and think to run away with that which they are far
enough from attaining. The 4 Elements, the 3 Chymical Principles, Magne∣netism,
<PB N="174" REF="212"/>
Sympathy, Fermentation, Alkaly and Acid, and divers other Chimera's,
too many to repeat; which having been embraced, nothing else will be heard,
or go down with them; whereas, alass, Nature perhaps knows no one of these
for a Principle in any sense, much less in that which they understand it. Of
which I shall say more elsewhere.</P>
<P>But to proceed, this Supposition of the two fundamental and primary Powers,
to wit, that of <HI>Matter,</HI> and that of <HI>Motion,</HI> which I have here delivered,
seems to me very consonant to the Sense I understand of the History of the <HI>Ge∣nesis</HI>
of the World, delivered by <HI>Moses</HI> in the first Chapter of <HI>Genesis:</HI> And
though the Words of that History be by divers Authors very differingly ex∣plain'd
and applied, yet by seriously considering of them, I conceive they may
genuinely bear this Sense also in which I shall here mention them.</P>
<P>The words of the 1st Verse, as render'd in our <HI>English,</HI> are:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A brief inter∣terpretation of the beginning of <HI>Genesis.</HI></NOTE> <HI>In the beginning
God created the Heaven and the Earth:</HI> In the <HI>Hebrew</HI> 'tis, <HI>the Heavens;</HI> but the
<HI>Greek, Samaritan</HI> and <HI>Arabick</HI> render it only the <HI>Heaven.</HI> The <HI>Syriack</HI>
renders it, <HI>the Being of Heaven and the Being of Earth:</HI> But the <HI>Arabick</HI> ren∣ders
it thus: The first thing that God created was <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Earth.</HI> Which
Expression does seem to signify the first Power that I have mentioned, namely,
the <HI>Matter</HI> or <HI>Mater,</HI> the whole Substance of the Heavens and the Earth; that
is, that Substance, which being afterwards informed and qualified by <HI>Motion,</HI>
constituted the Heavens and the Earth. For it seems by the next Verse to be
for some time without the Impregnation of the second Principle, <HI>Motion;</HI> for
'tis said, <HI>the Earth was without form, and void, and Darkness was upon the Face
of the Deep,</HI> or the Abyss. The <HI>Hebrew</HI> is, <HI>Desertness and Inanity.</HI> The <HI>Greek</HI>
renders it <HI>invisible and incomposed.</HI> The <HI>Targum, desert and void.</HI> The <HI>Ara∣bick</HI>
renders it, <HI>covered with the Abyss, and overwhelmed with the Sea.</HI> And the
Original, and all the Translations, agree in the Darkness upon the Face of the
Abyss. All which Expressions seem to signify, that the <HI>Mater</HI> of Heaven and
Earth was yet without any kind of <HI>Motion</HI> in it, but like that imaginary Entity
we call Vacuity or Space; which was without any moving or acting Power in it,
but had as yet only the Power of Expansion, Extension, or Expatiation: For
this is what we understand by the Notion of <HI>Vacuum</HI> or Space and so is Dark∣ness,
namely, a Defect of the Motion of Light: For Light, as I have already
by many Arguments and Experiments proved, is a Motion, and that a regular,
uniform, and truly Geometrical Motion. So that the Sense of the second Verse
to me seems to be this, That the <HI>Mater</HI> out of which the Earth, or all the Solids
in the World were afterwards made, was yet only a pure <HI>Mater,</HI> or extended
Substance, and of the same nature with the Abyss, which had not in it the
2d Power <HI>Motion;</HI> but was dark, without the Motion of Light, without Form;
that is, without the Power of Motion, that makes Forms; desert of Quality,
Life, Action, or Distinction; wanting yet Motion, which maketh all the Di∣stinction,
Quality and Action that is in the World. Then follows the next Words,
which seem to signify the Creation, or Infusion of this second Power <HI>Motion.
And the Spirit of God moved upon the Face of the Waters.</HI> The Original is, <HI>And
the Spirit of God did move upon the Faces of the Waters.</HI> The <HI>Targum</HI> is, <HI>And
a Spirit from the Conspectu of God did blow in upon the Face of the Waters.</HI> The <HI>Sa∣maritan</HI>
renders it, <HI>And the Spirit of God was carried upon the Face of the Waters.</HI>
The <HI>Syriack</HI> renders it, <HI>And the Spirit of God did incubare, or brood, upon the Su∣perficies
of the Waters.</HI> The <HI>Arabick, And the Winds of God did blow upon the
Face of Water.</HI> All which several Readings do seem to signify the Creation and
Production of the second Power, <HI>Motion.</HI> For first, 'tis most
properly called a
<HI>Spirit,</HI> signifying its Power of moving, by which Property only we know it.
Next, it is said to move, or be moved, or blown in or carried upon the Face or
Superficies of the Waters. The <HI>Mater</HI> was now no longer dead, and unactive,
and Earth, but it became a Fluid, signified by Water. For, as I shall after∣wards
shew, it must in this Place be so taken, and not only for the Substance
Water, but that God joining the second Power <HI>Motion,</HI> and impregnating the
<HI>Mater</HI> with it, made every <HI>Minim</HI> of it to move with infinite Varieties of Mo∣tions:
And so all those which before lay still, and changed not their Places and
Positions in respect of one another, and were therefore called Earth, are now
by this Insufflation, Incubation, or acting of the Spirit of God upon the Super∣ficcies,
<PB N="175" REF="213"/>
become a perfect Fluid, or a Water. No two contiguous <HI>Minims</HI> yet
agree in Unity or Uniformity of Motion. And hitherto seems to be the Histo∣ry
of the Creation, or making of the two first Powers, <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Motion,
Body</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> or <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Form.</HI></P>
<P>In the next place follows the Description of the two great Laws of Motion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The two great Laws of Mo∣toon, Light an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gravity. 1. Light.</NOTE>
which constitute the Form and Order of the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or World. The first is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat
of <HI>Light,</HI> and the second is that of <HI>Gravity.</HI></P>
<P>First for that of <HI>Light,</HI> which is the first regular Motion, or Rule of
Nature, which is that regular Propagation of Motion, which, as I have for∣merly
explain'd, extends it self instantaneously through the Whole of Matter▪
We find in the third Verse, <HI>And God said, Let there be Light, and there was
Light, and God divided the Light from the Darkness.</HI> Whereby we find, that
the first Regulation of Motion was the Principle of <HI>Light;</HI> which seems to
signify, that this Propriety of the fluid Matter was then first implanted, by
which the similar Parts of it were made fit to propagate the Pulse of <HI>Light</HI> to
all imaginable Distance; and this Substance was distinguished from that other
Substance, which would not propagate it, which was opaque and dark: For as
yet we find neither the <HI>Sun</HI> nor <HI>Stars</HI> were made, nor the <HI>Earth</HI> it self formed
but only a Qualification of Matter fit for the performing of those Functions,
which were accordingly made distinct, and secondarily implanted: <HI>And God said, Let there be an Expansum, or a Firmament, and let it divide the Waters
from the Waters.</HI> This seems to signify the second general and grand Rule of
Natural Motion, namely, <HI>Gravity.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Gravity.</NOTE> For this Expansion or Firmament is said to
divide the Waters from the Waters, or one Fluid from another; for so the
Word <HI>Maim</HI> seems to signify. And this made all those Fluids which were of a
Terrestrial Nature, to congregate or gather together into the Mass of the Earth,
or Earths; and the other of a more Celestial Nature, to gather together in the
Sun and Stars. And this Expansion or Firmament, which was the extensive
Power of Gravitation, was that which caused those Effects. These two Powers
seem to constitute the Souls of the greater Bodies of the World, <HI>viz.</HI> the Sun
and Stars, and the Planets, both such as move about the Sun, and such as move
about any other Central Body: And both these are to be found in every such
Body in the World; but in some more, in some less, in some one is predomi∣nant,
in others the other; but no one without some Degree of both: For as
there is none without the Principle of <HI>Gravitation,</HI> so there is none without
some degree of <HI>Light.</HI> And though some doe not shew its Effects in producing
Light immediately, yet I shall make it probable that it has that Motion blend∣ed
with others, which hinder it from producing Effects, but yet do not wholly
destroy the Principle. And this I shall make the more probable, when I shall
shew how both these Powers are but distinct Effects produced by one and the
same Power, and that this Power is implanted in every such great Globular Bo∣dy
in the World. I could go on through the whole History delivered in this first
Chapter of <HI>Genesis,</HI> but that I only aimed at present to shew, that nothing of
what I have hitherto supposed, does any ways disagree with Holy Writ, but
rather, that it is perfectly consonant to that, as well as it is to Reason, and the
Nature of things themselves.</P>
<P>I have often made use of the Words <HI>Maximum</HI> and <HI>Minimum,</HI> or of the<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Maximum</HI> and <HI>Minimum,</HI> in what sense taken.</NOTE>
Greatest and the Least; and because there are various Opinions concerning the
Significancy of those Expressions, some understanding them in one sense, and
some in another, I would willingly have it understood in what sense I make use
of them.</P>
<P>By the Words <HI>Maximum</HI> and <HI>Minimum,</HI> or the Greatest and the Least, I un∣derstand
then only the greatest and the least Extension or Motion we have need
to make use of in speaking or supposing, which will still be bounded: For In∣finite
or Unbounded cannot have an Idea formed in our Imagination or Memo∣ry,
which must always have a bounded Idea, being material: And this bounded
Idea, however by comparing and reasoning we may suppose it differing; yet it is never bigger or less in reality, than the biggest Appearance we have had of the
Heavens, or the least Appearance we have had of a visible of other sensible Point.
These Ideas therefore of <HI>Maximum</HI> and <HI>Minimum,</HI> made use of in Discourse and
Reasoning, are compound Ideas, and consist of the simple Ideas of the sensible
<PB N="176" REF="214"/>
<HI>Maximum</HI> and <HI>Minimum,</HI> with a Proportion annexed. For, as much as the Idea
of the <HI>Maximum</HI> does exceed the Idea of the <HI>Minimum</HI> brought in by the Sense;
so much do we suppose the <HI>Minimum</HI> to exceed another <HI>Minimum,</HI> of which we
would make a single Idea, but we cannot; but it will always be a compounded
or comparative Idea; and so <HI>vice versâ</HI> of the <HI>Maximum.</HI> For neither can we
form a simple Idea of any thing that is a Million of Millions of times less than
the Idea of the least visible Point; nor can we form an Idea of a <HI>Maximum,</HI>
which is Millions of Millions bigger than the imaginary bigness of the Heavens
we fee; but by Composition, and Comparison, and Proportion, we make the
compounded Ideas, which suffice for a Material to be made use of in Reason∣ing. And when all comes to all, we do but reason upon the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in our own
Repository or Memory, which contains certain Ideas, Forms, Pictures or Marks,
we our selves have made of simple sensations; which are originally begun from
Motions without, but compleated, finished and disposed of within our selves,
by the Power and Activity of the Soul; from whence proceeds that Difference
which is to be found in the Imaginations and Reasonings of several Men: For
the things of Nature are the same, and the Informations are conveyed by the
same <HI>Media,</HI> and in the same Manner; yet partly the Organs of Men differ
considerably in their Perfections; but chiefly the inward Parts of the Organ of
Memory, and the natural or acquired Habits of the Soul in Imagination and
Reasoning, are exceeding different. Some men have a more piercing Sight, and
can distinguish a much smaller Point than others, possibly from the Tunicles and
Humours of the Eye, their exceeding Clearness and Transparency, and Exactness
of Figure; possibly also from the Fineness and excellent Structure of the sensibie
Part, and Optick Nerve, and Parts of the Brain serving to that purpose, and
from the Habit, Use and Exercise of those Parts and Faculties: But still in
the best, the <HI>Minimum</HI> and the <HI>Maximum visibile</HI> is limited, it can be no more
than a Hemisphere of the Eye, nor smaller than a Point of the Eye, which to
every Man is assignable; and whatever other Idea is formed to express a less or
a bigger, is a compounded or proportionate Idea, and will be plainly discover'd
so to be by any one that will but seriously so consider it.</P>
<P>But to leave this Digression, and proceed by various Enquiries in the Synthe∣tick
way, or by reasoning, and proceeding from sensible Observations and Expe∣riments,
to the more insensible Operations of Nature; I have already shewed
Light to be a continued Pulse or Motion propagated through a Diaphanous <HI>Me∣dium</HI>
to all imaginable Distance <HI>in orbem;</HI> and by this means to continually agi∣tate
and make fluid, vivify and regulate the greatest part of the Universe. I
have already shewed all its various ways of moving and crossing each other, and
the harmonious Chime, as it were, of the Pul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ations of several Luminous Points
or Bodies, and therefore shall not here repeat them any further than only naming,
As first, that Light makes all things sensible to the Eye: next, that such a Mo∣tion
causes Heat, produces and contiues Fluidity and Solidity; producing Union
and Separation; Union of homogeneous, and Separation of heterogeneous Bo∣dies.
These, I say, I have already pretty largely explain'd; and therefore I
shall leave the further Explanation of it to a more proper Place, and proceed
to the next Principle, <HI>Gravity,</HI> because I find that Principle to seem the more
new and strange to some Persons; and I would willingly remove such Difficul∣ties
as occur,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Effects of the Motion of Light.</NOTE> before I proceed, because otherwise there will be a hesitancy in all
that follows.</P>
<P>By <HI>Gravity</HI> then I understand such a Power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is under∣stood by Gra∣vity.</NOTE> as causes Bodies of a similar or homogeneous nature to be moved one towards the other, till they are united; or
such a Power as always impels or drives, attracts or impresses Motion into them,
that tends that way, or makes them unite. The Universality of this Principle,
throughout the whole and every thing therein, I shall afterwards have more occa∣sion to explain, when I come to the Effects of Nature in lesser Bodies.
At pre∣sent I shall only proceed to shew it in the greater Bodies of the World.</P>
<P>First then, that there is such a Power in the Earth, in respect of terrestrial
Bodies, I think no one will deny in the general. Some Disputes there have
been, I consess, among Philosophers, concerning the Nature of the Power it self,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. That there is such a thing.</NOTE>
and some concerning the Subject in which it is inherent: Some supposing it to
<PB N="177" REF="215"/>
be a <HI>Spirit,</HI> an <HI>hylarchick Spirit;</HI> others supposing it an <HI>innate Quality,</HI> or inhe∣rent
tendency to the Center of the World, not as 'tis the Center of the Earth,
but as it is the lowest Place in the Universe, and farthest removed from the Hea∣vens,
and from the more Spirituous and moving Bodies; and so is supposed the
worst of Places, and made <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it only to receive the Dregs of the Universe: And
were the Body of the Earth there, or not there; yet thither would all these dull
and earthy Bodies, that we now find descend, tend, and there remain. Others
suppose this Power placed in the <HI>Aether,</HI> and that by the Rotation thereof mak∣ing
it tend outward, the more solid Bodies, which consist of more bulky Parts
than the <HI>Aether,</HI> are driven downwards. Others 'place it in the <HI>Earth</HI> it self, which
they suppose like a great <HI>Loadstone,</HI> and to send forth certain Chains of uncous
or hooked Particles, which pull down all Terrestrial Bodies out of the Air, or
from any higher to any lower Place: And many other such Fictions and <HI>Chime∣ra's,</HI>
which serve only to inform us what kind of Notions and Imaginations
those Men had in their own Minds; but in no wife to inform us of what the
Power is, or in what manner it operates. Only this farther we may collect from
them all, that every one of them took it for granted, that heavy and terrestrial
Bodies were by some Power moved towards the Center of the Earth, whether
their particular Notions concerning that Power were right or not.</P>
<P>Next, there have been as many differing Opinions concerning the Limits of
this Power:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of its Limits upwards.</NOTE> Some extending it too far, and others as extravagantly too little:
Some supposing, that wheresoever in the Universe a terrestrial Body should be
placed, there it would have a tendency towards the Center of the World or
Earth; and therefore that in the Creation, all the Terrestrial Matter of the <HI>Chaos</HI>
met together, and made up the Body of the Earth. Others, on the other hand,
have been too penurious in limiting its Power to some few Miles; some to 50
Miles, others to a Boundary, that a Cannon well charg'd with Powder would
be able to shoot a Bullet out of its reach. But though they are both enough
mistaken, yet they agree in this, that this Power of Gravitation does act at some
distance above the Surface of the Earth.</P>
<P>Others differ again about the Modes and Limits of its working within the
Body of the Earth below its Surface;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Modes and Limits of its working be∣low the Surface of the Earth.</NOTE> but no one I have yet met with seems to
me to have hit upon a right Notion concerning it; and yet all agree in this, that there is such a Power somewhere placed, that does act regularly, and within some
certain Limits. I could proceed farther to mention their Explanations; but I
conceive they would be too long, and not much to my present purpose.</P>
<P>In the next place, this Power acts regularly and uniformly. I argue its Regu∣larity or Uniformity of acting on all sides or superficial Parts of the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. it acts regu∣latly.</NOTE> from
the Spherical Surface of the Sea; and that from the Shadow of the Earth in
Eclipses of the Moon, where the Picture of Shadow of it is found to be round:
And therefore though I cannot without very much trouble here upon the Earth,
be ascertain'd of the Uniformity or Equality of the Power of Gravity working
every way nearly towards the Center of the Earth; and though I cannot a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cend
high enough, tho' I should get to the top of the hig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est Mountain in the World,
to have a certainty from Inspection or Sight: Yet this alone, of the roundess of
the Shadow in Eclipses, is Argument enough to persuade any unprejudiced Person
from disbelieving it, as a Matter very unlikely; though it be not sufficient to
prove its Geometrical Roundness, which must be proved by other <HI>Mediums.</HI> Be∣sides,
we find that it must be very near round, and consequently have very near
uniform Gravitation, from the general Observations of Navigators, who do find,
that so many Leagues sailed Northwards or S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uthwards, do alter a Degree of
Latitude; which were the Gravitation not pretty near equal, it would not so
happen. 'Tis possible, by very accurate trial, the Truth and Certainty thereof
might be positively proved and determined; but 'twill require more than my
Opportunities will reach unto at present, to do it, though I can shew how. It were desirable however, that it were once for all accurately tried.</P>
<P>The reason why I insist so much upon this Argument of the Roundness of the
Figure of the Earth, is, because I take this Roundness to be as convincing an
Argument as any, to prove that there is the like Power in every Globular Cele∣stial Body, as there is in the Earth▪ For since all the Celestial Bodies, whose
<PB N="178" REF="216"/>
Shape we are able to discover, are found to be of a Globular Figure, as is the
Earth, and that several of them do turn round upon their <HI>Axes</HI> (as we find
beyond doubt that the Sun and <HI>Jupiter</HI> do) were there not in them such a gra∣vitating
Power, all the loose Parts of their Bodies must▪ be shot out from them,
or thrown away like a Stone out of a Sling swung round, or the loose Parts
sticking to a Wheel or Top, when whirled round; and consequently▪ they must
in a little time be dispersed and shattered to pieces. But no such Appearance
has ever been observed: Therefore it is an Argument that there is such a Power
in those round Bodies of the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Jupiter,</HI> which keep those moveable Par<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
from flying off. For that the Sun has moveable Parts, is evident by the Disco∣very
of our Telescopes, which shew us various sorts of Spots; which Spots,
whether they be Clouds of Smoke, or more opaque▪ Parts that rise out of the
Body it self, and only float on a fluid part of the Body of the <HI>Sun,</HI> like the
<HI>Scoria</HI> or Dross of red-hot melted Mettal, is not yet determined: And 'tis most
probable they are of the former nature, by the various Circumstances that have
been taken notice of; but be they which soever, yet the whirling of the Sun
would throw them off, were there not such an attracting Power that kept them
from receding, since 'tis evident they are loose from the rest of the Body. The
like may be said for <HI>Jupiter,</HI> in whose Phases great Alterations have been obser∣ved
by several; and Mons. <HI>Cassini</HI> judges some of▪ those Appearances to be cau∣sed
by some kind of Waters. The like I conceive may be said for the Body of
<HI>Saturn,</HI> though our Telescpes have not yet certainly distinguisb'd <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aenomena</HI>
sufficient to prove its Rotation.</P>
<P>I say moreover, that this Power is not only placed in the Earth, but that there
is the like Power in every Globular Body in the Universe, whether Sun or Fixed
Star, Planet primary or secondary, and in the Cometical Body included, as I
have supposed, within the <HI>Nucleus</HI> or white Cloud appearing in the Head.</P>
<P>In the third place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Its Power acts indefinite∣ly upwards.</NOTE> I say, that this Power of Gravity, which is sufficiently
evident on the Superficies of the Earth, and acts so regularly every where round
the Surface of the Globes, is not suddenly extinguished, nor loseth its Power at
a little height above us: But, as I conceive, it is extended to a vast distance up∣ward,
even indefinitely; and though it may be said to be sensibly finite, yet this
sensible Boundary has its Limits prodigiously large; and when the Degree of its
Power, which shall be called sensible, is stated, then these Limits also or Distance
of such an imaginary Surface, may be Geometrically determined, and the Pro∣portion
of the Semi Diameter of it to that of the Globe of the Body in the
middle, exactly determined and demonstrated. I conceive further, that this
Power thus extended, does act with various Degrees at several Distances from
this Body, which Degrees I shall also endeavour to state, and, as I conceive,
evidently▪ demonstrate from my Hypothesis, founded, as I conceive, upon the
<HI>Phaeomena</HI> of Nature, and not taken up at random, or by chance. These my
Conceptions (as being, I think, wholly knew, and not yet asserted by any Per∣son
whatsoever) may seem strange and extravagant, and I must be content to
have them so esteemed, by such as may either have a Prepossession for some o∣ther
Hypothesis, or shall not allow of the Arguments I shall bring to confirm
them as sufficient for that purpose. It cannot, I suppose, be expected that I
should try or shew Experiments at Distances sufficient to prove it experimentally
and positively; and therefore all that I can bring is only this, that I find a cer∣tain
Agreement and▪ Coherence of this my Supposition with other Operations in
Nature, and that hereby the Appearances of Nature's working are explain'd:
Whereas I cannot find that by any other Hypotheses that have been hitherto
made known,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several Opini∣ons concerning the Motions of the Planets.</NOTE> the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the Heavens can be intelligibly and clearly sol∣ved,
without the granting of many such Actions or Motions, as are very absurd,
dissonant, and contrary to the natural Motions, Actions and Effects of Powers
and Motions, which are within our reach to examine. Whence some of them,
that they may give a Cause of the undoubted Appearances, have been fain to
suppose understanding Beings, Spirits or Intelligences, to be the Movents or
Causes of such Extravagancies. Others have supposed various sorts of solid
Orbs, Orbits, Epicycles, and I know not what other Wheel-work, to make out
the sensible Inequalities, and yet regular Periods; which being too gross,
<PB N="179" REF="217"/>
and contradicted by the Motion of Comets, others have rejected, but
instead thereof, have supposed Magnetism, as <HI>Kepler</HI> and his Followers,
who have to that end feigned a Friendly Side and an Enemy Side to be
planted in the circumgyrating Celestial Bodies: And because the Moon al∣ways
keeps the same Side very near, respecting the Earth, and so its Appearances
contradicted this Supposition; therefore they supposed▪ a <HI>Nucleus</HI> within the
Moon, which had a differing Motion and Position in respect of the Parts of the
Shell, or outward superficial Parts of the Moon which appeared. To help this
yet farther, for this was not enough to do the business, they supposed a radiating
Species to stand always stiff, like the Spokes in the Nave of the Wheel, and to
turn round as the Body placed in the middle is turned; which radiating Species
or Spokes, like a kind of Besom, sweep along the Planet with them, not so fast
as they themselves are moved, but with a somewhat <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lower Pace<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and that so
much the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lower, as the Body to be sweeped forward was farther distant. But
beside this, another Actor is needed, and that is, a second sort of Spokes made
of the Rays of Light; these also are supposed▪ to help to sweep it on. Na<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
besides all these there is another Help wanting, and that is, Magnetism, like
that of the Dipping Needle; by which means there is feigned also to be a kind
of Libration, sometimes of the Body, fometimes of the Orbit. And after all
these and several other <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame Helps supposed, we find they are fain to be most
thrown aside, when they come to Calculation. Others, as <HI>DesCartes</HI> and his Fol∣lowers,
have supposed a Whirling of the <HI>Aether</HI> round each Star, or Planetary▪
Body, and a swimming of the Planet that moves round it in this <HI>Vortice.</HI> But
how uncertain Effects and Motions of the Planetary Bodies▪ must this way be
produced, any one that considers well the Hypothesis, will quickly find, and as
readily conclude, that if this Hypothesis be true, there can be no
Astronomy; besides, that were it granted, the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> themselves could not be solved.
It may still be said, that the disproving of all these will still be no Argument
why what I have here supposed should be true.</P>
<P>But then it may likewise be farther urged, ist, That this Hypothesis or Asser∣tion
which I have laid down, doth not create or suppose any new or unheard of
Powers or Motions, but supposes only such as are altogether uniform and simi∣lar
to Powers, Operations, Effects or Motions, which are within our reach and
command, which we daily try, see, and find the regular working of.</P>
<P>My Arguments therefore to prove this Supposition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arguments to prove the Sup∣position</NOTE> are only these.</P>
<P>First, That What I here suppose in all Bodies, I can prove to be in some, and
so suppose nothing absurd or impossible.</P>
<P>Secondly, That the Principles I ground it upon, are (according to the
working of Nature in all things) the most simple and the shortest that can be:
And 'tis generally asserted so to be by all Philosophers, and found by all inqui∣sitive
Searchers into Nature. <HI>Natura ni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il agit frustra, sed frustra fit per plura▪
quod fieri potest per pauciora.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, That Nature seems to take similar Ways for producing similar Effects;
without granting of which we cannot reason or make any Conclusion from simi∣lar
Operations. And then it would be no Absurdity to say, a Man grew out of
the Earth like a Plant, or a Plant had Understanding and spoke.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That more or less of these Principles is to be found in every Body
in Nature, but more remarkable in some of the Bodies in which I here suppose
it, and that there is nothing that I have met with that does seem to shew a con∣trary
or contradicting Quality in any one of them.</P>
<P>Fifthly, That from these most single and easy Principles of Body and Moti∣ons
here asserted, there will follow such a Regulated Motion, as will <HI>a priori</HI>
shew what are, have been, or shall be at any time assigned the true Places and
Motions of the Celestial Bodies, consonant to the Appearances themselves:
And this not in one, but in all, as I hope I shall shortly make more evident.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="218"/>
First then, that what I here suppose to be in all Celestial Globular Bodies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That Planetary Bodies have a Gravitation to them.</NOTE> I
can demonstrate to be in some; I think will readily enough be granted, when I
prove that the Earth, on which we live, is one of those Celestial Bodies: And
that Part I think I have proved by the Observation which I made of the Parallax
of the Orb of the Earth to the bright Star in the Dragon's, Head, which passes
very near the <HI>Zenith</HI> of <HI>London;</HI> an Account of which I have already given in
my Attempt to prove the Motion of the Earth, which Attempt (how <HI>trivial</HI>
soever it may be supposed, yet considering, that without, some such Proof we
were condemned to the worst Place in the Universe, and so thought unfit and un∣able
to understand any thing of Celestial Bodies) has given Mankind, one Argu∣ment
at least to believe somewhat better of their Mother Earth and themselves, than
they did before, viz. That she hath <HI>Origo Caelestis,</HI> and that we our selves are <HI>Incolae
Caelestes.</HI> And so being granted able, at least, to consider, examine and reason
about the Nature of the Earth on which we live, we are at the same time grant∣ed
to be able to consider, examine and understand the Nature of some Celestial
Body. This being granted, all the <HI>Ptolemaick</HI> solid Orbs immediately vanish, and
all the ingenious Clockwork which has since that time been added to his. For
since we are assured by this Observation, that the Body of the Earth is moved
round the Sun once in a Year, and that the Earth swims or is incompassed with a
fluid Air only, or a more fluid <HI>Aether,</HI> and that the other Planetary Bodies are
moved about the Sun in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame manner as the Earth, and have the same Passi∣ons
and Affections as the Earth hath of acceding towards and receding from wards
the Sun, of moving swifter and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lower, according to several Distances from that
Body, of turning round upon their <HI>Axes,</HI> of carrying peculiar lesser Planets along
with them, which move about them as the Moon doth about the Earth, of
eclipsing and being eclipsed by those Bodies, of being inlightned by the Beams
of the Sun, and of being dark where that Light cannot shine, and the like;
why should we any more suppose it necessary that the other Planets should have
solid Orbs to guide their Motions, than we find the Earth it self, which is one
of them, really hath? not now to urge the Arguments drawn from the Motions
of Comets. This <HI>trivial</HI> Observation then was necessary to introduce us into the
<HI>Expansum</HI> of Heaven, and to manifest to us how great a Voyage we make in a
Year, and what we also do in the space of twenty four hours, and to inform us
what Opportunity we have of surveying and knowing more of the World than
before we thought our selves capable of. And though the Notion was perhaps
fully understood and believed long before the other of <HI>Ptolemy</HI> was broacht;
yet being only a Probability, there could be no positive and undoubting Assent
given unto it, without some such Experiment or Observation as I have formerly
produced. The Earth then being found to be a Planetary Body, it will be no
difficult matter to prove, that it hath that Propriety which we call Gravity;
that is, that all Terrestrial Bodies, or such Bodies that seem to be part of it,
or that are of a like nature with it, are continually moved, or have an Endea∣vour
to move towards the Center of the whole, which Endeavour is called the
Gravity of such Bodies: And consequently a Planetary Body is proved to have Gravity, and 'twill not be difficult to prove the same in all the other.</P>
<P>It remains only to enquire what is the Cause or Principle of this Gravity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Inquiry into the Cause of Gravity. Some of its Proprieties enumerated.</NOTE>
and what invisible or insensible Power it is that causes this Endeavour. Various have
been the Attempts of several to explain it, but no one, that I have yet met with, to
me seems satisfactory; nor would they make out the <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> tho' all they
have supposed, how extravagant soever they be, should be granted; whatever
the Power be that doth thus cause Bodies to move towards the Center.</P>
<P>1st, It is wholly insensible by any other Means than by the Effects. There are
no <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amous Particles underneath to be discover'd to pull down the Body, nor any
hammer Particles above to beat it down. A Body is not less heavy though there
be never so thick, nor never so dense a Body placed between that and the Earth
to break the Chains, or above it to hinder the Strokes of the Hammers or strik∣ing
Particles; nay though included every way within the densest Body; as the
middle Parts of a great Stone, or Piece of Mettal, weigh as much when whole,
as when the same is broken in pieces.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="219"/>
<HI>2dly,</HI> The Endeavour of Gravity acts or tends always towards the Center of
the Globe of the Earth, as far as any Observation has been made. This is ge∣nerally
granted and believed by all, though I doubt whether it hath been ever
proved; for though I believe it nearly probable to be so, yet I am not assured of
it by any Experiment yet so much as attempted to be made. The best way that
I know how to prove it, is, to measure the parts of a Meridian upon the Earth
from Pole to Pole, and compare them with Celestial Meridional Altitudes:
For if they every where correspond and answer one another, then the Perpen∣dicular
Line is true in all those Places; but if otherwise, not. And till this
be done, we are not by any certain Experiment assured, that the Body of the
Earth it self is perfectly Globular; for it may be somewhat either of an Egg-form,
the longest Diameter being in the <HI>Axis,</HI> or else of a Turnep-form, the
longest Diameter being in the Equinoctial. Nor is the Shadow of the Earth
eclipsing the Moon, sufficiently distinct to determine this Point. This Gravi∣tating
therefore to a Central Point, though it be probable, is not yet posi∣tively
proved by any Observations hitherto made, nor is it very easy to be made
to sufficient exactness. But though we have no Experiment here made on the
Earth, that does positively evince it; yet this fetcht from the other Planets, may
do something towards it: Namely, that most of the rest of the Planets (some
of which are certainly bigger than the Earth it self, and, as I but now men∣tioned,
have the same Qualifications) are observed to be very near Globular.
Here by the by, I cannot but take notice, that there are in Philosophy many
things that are generally taken for granted which yet when we seek for the
grounds of those Opinions, none certain are to be found, and thence all that is
built upon them must be uncertain. For instance, in Experiments that have
been made to prove the Magnitude of a Degree, 'twill be insufficient to prove
the Magnitude of the Earth, till by comparing several made in several Lati∣tudes,
they are all found to agree, and shew the same Quantity: For if the
Earth be Oval, as there seems to be good reason to suppose, then the Length of
a Degree in one Latitude will not be equal to the Length of a Degree in another
Latitude, and the Perpendicular of Gravity will not always point to the Center
of the Earth. For if the Principle or primary Cause of Gravity, which I
conceive an internal Motion in the Earth, be every way uniform, and so cause
an equal Attraction to the Center, then any other Cause that alters the Dispo∣tions
of Bodies to receive this Power, or that superinduces another Power that
in some parts of the Earth has a greater Renitency against the Power of Gravi∣ty
than it hath in other Parts; then the uniform Effect which Gravity alone
would operate, will be altered by the adventitious Power. Now the Diurnal
Rotation of the Earth doth superinduce such a Power; for the Parts near the
Equinoctial must have an Endeavour outwards, or from the Center; whereas
the Parts nearer the Poles must have less, and so much the less, by how much
the nearer they approach the Poles: And this Renitency, as it will be directly
opposite to Gravity under the Equinoctial, so will it be in all other Parts ob∣lique
unto it. Wherefore from the consideration of these two Causes, there
seems to be a probability that the Perpendicular does not always and every where
point to the Central Point of the Earth, how generally soever that Opinion be
received which asserts the contrary; and may possibly deserve some further En∣quiry,
as opportunity shall offer; and there must want a Demonstration till this
Question be determined. And by the way 'tis very remarkable, that by compa∣ring
of former with later Observations of the Magnitude of a Degree, the
Earth seems to have continually grown less. But of these and several other
Remarks I shall speak more, when I come to read concerning the Earth it self:
I shall therefore return to the consideration of Gravity in general. This be∣lieved
Roundness of the Figure, shews Gravity to act regularly in every part of
the Earth's Superficies, otherwife it could not be nearly round.</P>
<P>In the 3d place then,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3dly, This Gravitation and Levitation extends to and beyond the Earth.</NOTE> the tendency of Grave Bodies respects the middle Parts
of the Earth, though these Central Parts be carried with a very swift Motion
from West to East by an annual Motion about the Sun. And therefore 'tis pro∣bable
that it carrys with it the Principle or Power that acts; and thence, that it
<PB N="182" REF="220"/>
must there be sought for. This will need no other Proof, its Motion being al∣ready
proved by the Perpendicular Observation.</P>
<P>4<HI>thly,</HI> Gravity is a Power which at all times acts equally; that is, a Body
which remains the same, will always be found to have the same weight. This
I conceive, none will doubt, but yet 'tis not very easy positively to prove it; for
Scales cannot examine it, because if the gravitating Power alter, the Counter∣poise
will be affected as well as the Weight; nor can it be try'd with my Phi∣losophical Scales made by a Spring, because it may be said, the Alteration is in
the Spring, and not in the Weight. The only way that I conceive it may be
try'd, is by the Descent of Bodies, compar'd with the time of their descending
a certain Space, or because that will be very nice, by the Vibrations of a Pen∣dulum,
whose time and number of Vibrations may be stinted: But here also
will come some Objections, that there may be other Causes of altering the Ve∣locity
of the Vibrations, besides Gravity, as the shrinking and stretching of the
Rod; the thickning or thinning of the Air or Medium in which the Pendulum
moves, unless it be in <HI>Vacuo,</HI> and the like. Yet I conceive these and others may
be obviated, and the Matter determined, if that were necessary; but another
Argument hereafter to be mentioned of the Moon, will better clear it.</P>
<P>5<HI>thly,</HI> Gravity is observed to accelerate the Velocity of descending Bodies
with equal Accelerations in equal times. This hath been sufficiently proved by
falling Bodies and Pendulums, to certain Degrees pretty near, but not exactly.
And therefore in the</P>
<P><HI>6th</HI> place, Gravity is a finite Power, and acts with a determinate Degree of
Force; that is, the Gravitating Power can never accelerate any Body beyond its
own Velocity. That it is finite, we easily find from the Power we have of
throwing or shooting Bodies upwards, which could not be, did not the Power
of the Arm, Bow or Gun exceed it: And comparative to other Powers of Na∣ture, 'tis weak.</P>
<P><HI>7thly,</HI> That it acts on all Bodies promiscuously, whether fluid or solid: So
that the same Body which can be made fluid or solid, provided nothing be added
to it or taken from it, will have, in both Forms, the same weight <HI>quam proxime.</HI></P>
<P>8<HI>thly,</HI> The Bodies most receptive of it are such as have their Particles of the
greatest bulk and of the closest Texture. This the whole Series of grave Bodies
will sufficiently manifest: and I shall afterwards prove, when I come to shew
the Texture of Body, what it is that causes Bodies to be grave or heavy, and
what makes them light, and that 'tis not the quantity of Matter contained with∣in
the same Space, but the Modification of that Matter, and the Receptivity it
hath of Uniform Power.</P>
<P><HI>9thly,</HI> I cannot find by any certain Experiment, that grave Bodies do sensibly
decrease in Gravity, tho' further removed from the Surface of the Earth; which
was the Intent of an Experiment I formerly tryed at the top of the Steeple of St.
<HI>Paul</HI>'s and at <HI>Westminster-Abby,</HI> and may now again be repeated with much more
conveniency and greater advantage at the Column on <HI>Fishstreet-Hill.</HI> For by counter∣poising
two Weights in a curious Pair of Scales, first at the top of the Steeple, and
then letting down one of the Weights by a Wire of two hundred and four Foot in
length, the Counterpoise remaining at the top in the Scale, the <HI>Aequipondium</HI>
remained; whereas if the Gravity of the Body had increased by Approximation
to the Earth, the Weight let down to the bottom must have weighed the heavier.
But though the Difference were insensible in so small an height, yet I am apt to
think some Difference may be discovered in greater heights, and by some more
curious ways than those I then used, even in that height: For I shall in my
following Discourses plainly shew, from the Theory thereof, that there is ne∣cessarily
a Difference, and that the Power of Gravity does decrease at farther
and farther Distance from the Center of the Earth, and consequently that the
Line of a projected descending Body is not truly Parabolical, but Elliptical,
<PB N="183" REF="221"/>
though it shoutd be made <HI>in vacuo,</HI> where the Impediment of the <HI>Medium</HI> could
make very little or no Alteration.</P>
<P>Having enumerated some of the most remarkable Proprieties of Gravity, we
come in the next place to consider what may be the Cause thereof.</P>
<P>And first, I believe I shall not need to say much against the Opinion of <HI>Intel∣ligent
Matter,</HI> which supposes every part of Matter to act understandingly; for
that being supposed, all Philosophy is vain, and there needs no farther Inquiry
into Nature.</P>
<P>And secondly, I have as little to say to its Cousin-german Opinion, <HI>viz:</HI> the
<HI>Regimen</HI> of an <HI>Hylarchick Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>And 3ly, The <HI>Epicurean</HI> Atoms seem to me to give as little of Explanation
almost as either of the former.</P>
<P>And 4ly, For the <HI>Peripatetick</HI> Doctrine of tendency to the Center of the Uni∣verse,
besides that the Foundation is false, the Earth being proved not to be in
the Center, 'tis not yet understood what the tendency is.</P>
<P>5ly, The <HI>Cartesian</HI> Doctrine, and that of Mr. <HI>Hobbs,</HI> are both insufficient,
because they do not give any reason why Bodies should descend towards the
Center under or near the Poles.</P>
<P>6ly, Nor will the <HI>Magnetism</HI> of <HI>Gilbert</HI> or <HI>Kepler</HI> serve; for, as I shall af∣terwards
shew, that is a Propriety distinct from Gravity, and of quite another
nature.</P>
<P>It must therefore be somewhat else differing from all these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What the Cause of Gravity is.</NOTE> which by reason
of its acting by the means of some very insensible Body, it will be very hard to
demonstrate, yet not altogether impossible. We find then that a Propriety some∣what
like this is to be found in the Attraction of the Magnet and Iron. Ano∣ther
somewhat like it is to be found in Amber, Jet, Glass, Chrystal, Diamonds,
and several hard Bodies upon Rubbing: And more instructive yet to this Inqui∣ry
is the Experiment of Mr. <HI>Newton,</HI> of rubbing a Plate of Glass, which is
laid over some small bits of Paper, or other light Bodies, at some distance, by
which Rubbing the Papers are made to rise up towards the Glass, and stick fast
to it. Now in all these Experiments there is a sensible Attraction of Grave
Bodies to the respective attracting Bodies, or at least a Motion of those Bodies
towards one another; though in all, the <HI>Medium,</HI> that causes this Endeavour of
Motion, be insensible. Some have supposed for Amber, that the same being a
very unctuous Body, certain stringy unctuous <HI>Effluvia</HI> are sent out, which stick∣ing
to the light Bodies, are drawn into the Amber again, and so bring back with
them the light Bodies. But this is very hard to be supposed of Glass or Chry∣stal,
and least of all of a Diamond, which yet will have a considerable Electri∣city,
as 'tis called, upon Rubbing; Besides, 'tis evident by Mr. <HI>Newton's</HI> Expe∣riment,
that the greatest Electricity of Glass is at the very time when it is hard∣est
rubbed, which should be the time when these unctuous Strings should be
sent out; 'tis necessary therefore that some other Medium must be found than
these unctuous and stringy Emanations.</P>
<P>If we farther consider of these Experiments, we shall find that there is in all
these a necessity of an internal vibrative Motion of the Parts of the Electrick
Bodies; and that so soon as ever that Motion ceases, the Electricity also ceases:
We may therefore conclude, that there may be such an internal Motion of the
Parts of some Bodies, as may cause an Electrical Virtue in them, whereby they
will be able to draw, with some small Degree of Power, some Bodies to them.</P>
<P>I have already here produced several Experiments, whereby I have shewn how
mechanically to produce such an Attraction towards the acting Body. The first
was that of a Body placed upon a wooden Rod, the one End of which was kept
in its place by a Spring, and the other was struck by a Hammer, whereby it
plainly appeared, that at every Stroke the Body was moved on the Rod towards
the Hammer that struck. Here the <HI>Aether</HI> was resembled to a Solid. By the
second Experiment, where a Ball poised in Water descended toward the striking
Part, I shewed how the same Effect might be done by a fluid Medium, as in
the other was done by a Solid. In the third was shewn how a Fluid also might
<PB N="184" REF="222"/>
be affected by a like Pulse;<NOTE PLACE="marg">See more Expe∣riments in the Author's Life.</NOTE> for that the Water it self, by means of a vibra∣tive
Motion in the Parts of the Glass, acquired a Motion towards the vibrating
Parts. I should have proceeded, if not interrupted, to have experimentally
proved the Effect of this Power in <HI>Media</HI> much more insensible. The Obvious∣ness
possibly of these and such like Experiments may make them be looked up∣on
as slight and trivial; and the Paucity of them, for that they come not in by
whole Shoals, but are only caught, singly, may make them not regarded. But
as the Miracle was not less of the single Fish catched▪ by a Hook, with the
Tribute in has Mouth, than of the Shoals which were ready to sink the Vessels,
and brake the Nets: So some one plain but pertinent Experiment, apply'd with
Judgment, may be more significant than thousands of such as are pompous, amu∣sing,
and excite-Admiration. And I am satisfied that more Discoveries in Nature
may be made by the most plain, obvious and trivial Experiments to be every∣where
met with, than by the far-fetcht and dear bought Experiments which some
seek after.</P>
<P>Nor is this way of working at a distance, by means of the internal Mo∣tion
of the Particles of the Body; so strange a thing in Nature, that we need
much to insist upon these few Experiments to prove it. For if we consider the
<HI>Totum Sensibile</HI> in Nature, we shall find it to be little else than what is this way
produced. I have already, I think, fully proved in Light and Colour, the
Object of Sight, that the Motion which is produced in the Eye, proceeds from
an internal Motion made in the Sun so many thousands of Miles distant, or from
the same in some Stars so many thousand times as much farther off. I could also
as easily prove, that Sound in the Ear, which is a real Motion in some part thereof,
is produced by the internal Motion of the Parts of the Bell some Miles perhaps
distant. Somewhat like to this may also be said of the Smell, and the other
Senses; but the Instances of the first two will be sufficient; especially the latter
is the most evident; and that because both the Motion in the Bell, and the Mo∣tion
in the Ear, or some other Body there placed, is discovered by the other sen∣ses,
namely, by the Sight and Touch, as well as by the Ear.</P>
<P>These Particulars I could more largely explain by particular Experiments, and
plainly evince, that the Motions of several Bodies at a distance, are caused by
the internal Motion of the sounding Body; and that this Power of moving is
every way propagated by the ambient <HI>Medium,</HI> which excites in solid Bodies at a
distance, a similar Motion. I could farther also prove, that every one of these
distinct internal Motions of Bodies, as that of Light, and that of Sound, have
distinct and differing <HI>Mediums,</HI> by which those Motions are communicated from
the affecting to the affected Body: And so I conceive also that the <HI>Medium</HI> of
Gravity may be distinct and differing both from that of Light, and from that of
Sound. I conceive then, that the Gravity of the Earth may be caused by some
internal Motion of the internal or central Parts of the Earth; which internal
and central Motion may be caused, generated and maintained by the Motion of
the external and all the intermediate Parts of its Body: So that the whole Globe
of the Earth may contribute to this Motion, as it will happen to a Globe of
Glass or solid Mettal, to any part of which no internal Motion can be commu∣nicated,
without at the same time affecting the whole with the same Motion.
And I shall most plainly and evidently prove, when I come to the Explication of
Magnetism, that this is undeniably performed and effected by this means.</P>
<P>Suppose then that there is in the Ball of the Earth such a Motion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hypothesis of the Cause of Gravity.</NOTE> as I, for distin∣ction
sake, will call a <HI>Globular Motion,</HI> whereby all the Parts thereof have a Vi∣bration
towards and fromwards the Center, or of Expansion and Contraction; and
that this vibrative Motion is very short and very quick, at it is in all very hard and
very compact Bodies: That this vibrative Motion does communicate or produce a
Motion in a certain Part of the <HI>Aether,</HI> which is interspersed between these solid
vibrating Parts; which communicated Motion does cause this interspersed Fluid to
vibrate every way in <HI>Orbem,</HI> from and towards the Center, in Lines radiating from
the same. By which radiating Vibration of this exceeding Fluid, and yet exceed∣ing
dense Matter, not only all the Parts of the Earth are carried or forced down
towards the Center; but the Motion being continued into the <HI>Aether,</HI> interspersed
between the Air and other kinds of Fluids, it causeth those also to have a tendency
towards the Center; and much more any sensible Body whatsoever, that is any
<PB N="185" REF="223"/>
where placed in the Air, or above it, though at a vast Distance; which Distance
I shall afterwards determine, and shew with what proportioned Power it acts up∣on
Bodies at all Disances both without and within the Earth: For this Power pro∣pagated,
as I shall then shew, does continually diminish according as the Orb of Pro∣pagation
does continually increase, as we find the Propagations of the <HI>Media</HI> of
Light and Sound also to do; as also the Propagatian of Undulation upon the Su∣perficies
of Water. And from hence I conceive the Power thereof to be always
reciprocal to the <HI>Area</HI> or Superficies of the Orb of Propagation, that is duplicate of
the Distance; as will plainly follow and appear from the consideration of the Na∣ture
thereof, and will hereafter be more plainly evinced by the Effects it causes
at such several Distanccs.</P>
<P>This propagated Pulse I take to be the Cause of the Descent of Bodies towards
the Earth. But it way perhaps seem a little strange how the Propagation of a
Motion outward should be the cause of the Motion of heavy Bodies down∣wards.
To make this the more intelligible, I shall mention an Observation very
commonly known amongst Tradesmen; and that is, the driving of a Hammer
or Axe upon the Helve, which to do the easiest way, they commonly strike the
End of the Helve, holding the Helve in their Hand, and the Axe or Hammer at
the lower End hanging downward, by which means they not only make the Axe
to go on upon the Helve, but make it ascend, if they continue striking, even
to their very Hand. To apply which Observation to my present Theory, I say,
that the <HI>Medium</HI> of Propagation is the Helve, and the Axe or Hammer is the
grave Body that descends: So that at every Stroke that is given by the Globe of
the Earth to the propagating <HI>Medium,</HI> one Degree of Velocity of Descent is given
to the Grave Body, which is as it were the Axe. Now according to the Velocity
of this vibrative Motion of the Earth, so must the Power it communicates be
stronger or weaker. Suppose for instance, there should be 1000 of these Pulses
in a Second of Time; then must the Grave Body receive all those thousand Im∣pressions
within the space of that Second, and a thousand more the next, and a∣nother
thousand the third Second; so that in equal Times it would receive equal
Degrees of Acceleration. And if a Second of Time were again subdivided into
a thousand Moments of Time, the Body would receive one Degree of Accele∣ration
in the first moment, one more in the 2d, a 3d in a 3d, and so onwards:
So that the compounded Acceleration would be as one the first Second, three the
next Second, and five the next, and so onwards; according as it is observed in
the Motion of descending Bodies.</P>
<P>The <HI>Medium</HI> that propagates this Motion, I suppose to be one part of that which
permeates most Bodies, which we call by the general Name of <HI>Aether,</HI> and thence it
proceeds that the Motion is communicated to every part thereof: And so the <HI>Mo∣mentum</HI>
of every Body becomes proportioned to its Bulk or Density of Parts, difform
to the fluid <HI>Medium</HI> that communicates the Pulse.</P>
<P>The Objections that I expect against this Hypothesis may be some such as these.</P>
<P>1st. How does it appear there is any such Motion in the internal Parts of the
Body of the Earth? For who can descend thither, and if they could, how should
they find it, it being from the Hypothesis supposed not within the reach of Sense?</P>
<P>To this I answer, that though this be hypothetical, yet that there is some such
Motion in those Parts, I shall prove clear enough, when I come to the Expli∣cation
of Magnetism. In the mean time, there is nothing absurd or contradictory
to the rest of Nature. The solidest Body in the World can receive an internal
Motion of its Particles from an outward Impression; as has been found in Dia∣monds,
which upon Rubbing would shine, and upon so rubbing would become
Electrical, and attract Bodies to them; as I observed in the Diamond which
was formerly shewed this Society by Mr. <HI>Henshaw.</HI> Besides, that it is receptive
of internal Motion, is farther evident by the splitting or cleaving of a Diamond
by a smart Stroke; which is well enough known to our Jewellers and Lapida∣ries.
The hardest Chrystal, Porphyrys, Agates, Flints, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that I have yet met
with, will receive an internal Motion, as may be plainly argued from the Tone
they give upon being briskly struck. The hardest of Mettals always give the
best and longest Sounds, and consequently are the less hindred by the ambient
<HI>Medium. The Author breaks off here abruptly.</HI></P>

The following DISOVVRSE is a Lecture of Light, which I found
among the Authors Manuscripts: and tho' I found by another Paper that it
was read before the foregoing Lecures of Light; yet I judged it would not
prove unacceptable for the Experiments related in it; from which it will
appear, that the Picture of the Sun transmitted through a small Hole into
a dark Room, does not answer to what it ought to be by the received Laws
of Opticks; and also that the Rays of Light do not proceed in strait
Lines, as he endeavours to shew by Experiment. I shall not venture at
any Deductions, but leave that matter to the more intelligent Reader.
R. W.</Q>
<P>THERE is no means in the World for the attaining the true Knowledge of
things more certain and more instructive,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Experiments the best way to find out Truths.</NOTE> than the accurate Observation and
strict Examination of them by Trials and Experiments. And thought, I confess,
it is a much speedier and more easy way to collect and understand what is al∣ready
known, to read and study such Notions of them as are already deliver'd in
Authors treating of that Subject; yet, as 'tis that way quickly attainable, so
you will as quickly find your self at a <HI>non plus ultra</HI> in your Information, and
much full<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of Doubts and Queries as to a perfect Knowledge of the thing
you seek, than possibly you were, when you first enter'd upon that Inquiry.
For the more you are informed, the more able you are to inquire for and seek
after what is considerable to be farther known concerning that Subject; and that
Knowledge is much more apt to slip out of the Memory, and be forgotten:
Whereas that Knowledge which is attained by a Man's own Observation and
Study, as it always remains fixt in his Memory, so it so thoroughly informs his
Imagination with a true and right Idea of the thing he inquires into, that he is
able thereby readily to solve many Doubts and Difficulties that may at first oc∣cur
to him; and it puts him a capacity of pertinently inquiring farther into
the Nature and Cause of the thing he seeks after. And let me tell you, whoso∣ever
has a Knowledge of things made up only of what he finds in Books of that
Subject, shall find it to be very little, confused and imperfect; especially if
he comes to converse with such as have experimentally and sagaciously enquired
thereinto. And in very many cases he will not only find his Knowledge little,
confused and imperfect, but notoriously and dangerously false and erroneous: So
that this kind of Knowledge, instead of leading and directing of him in the
right way, oftentimes seduces him, and hurries him into the broad Way of
Error and conceited Ignorance. I could give you many Instances of this Truth
in Physicks, nay even in Mechanicks, whose Principles seem most obvious;
and shew you, that for want, I suppose, of accurate Trials and Experiments,
several Axioms, which have been received and builded on as Truths, both by all
the antient and modern Philosophers and Mathematicians, are yet notwith∣standing
by some few Trials and accurate Observations, found notoriously false:
But these I shall reserve for some other Opportunities. I shall now rather chuse
to give you an Instance in another Subject.</P>
<P>I have formerly endeavoured to explain several things concerning the Nature
and Essence of Light, which I shall not now repeat; but having still many
Doubts in my own Thoughts concerning the same, I have made it my aim, ac∣cording
as I had opportunity, to examine and inquire farther into the Nature
thereof, by such Observations and Experiments as I judged might be any ways
helpful to the Manifestation thereof. And herein I have not been altogether un∣succcssful,
having discovered several Proprieties therein, whereof before I had
no Notion or Information.</P>
<P>To this purpose prepared a Room fit for Trials of this nature, by so per∣fectly
stopping all ways by which the Light could find its Entrance into the
same, that the whole remained perfectly dark; at least so much, that though a
<PB N="187" REF="225"/>
Man staid a long time in the same, yet the Eye could not perceive any Light.
For though that in many cases be not absolutely necessary, yet in most 'tis gene∣rally
very convenient, and fit to make the Trial more accurate and certain. For
as in a Mixture of divers Liquors, 'tis very difficult to distinguish and deter∣mine
the true Taste of any one of them; so the Effects and Properties of any
one Ray is more obscurely perceived, when it is blended and mixed with the
Effects of a thousand others. In this darkened Room I provided such Conve∣niency
for admitting or excluding the Rays of Light, that I could let in what
quantity of Light I pleased, and in what manner; and thereby had the opportu∣nity
of finding several Proprieties thereof, which are not otherwise discoverable.
Having then thus darkened a Room, by a very small Hole through a Brass Plate
in part of the Shutter, I let through the Light of the Sun, which by degrees
spreading it self, seemed to make up a Cone, whose <HI>Apex</HI> was in the Hole, and
whose Base was on the Paper exposed to receive the same at a distance. In this
Image of the Sun thus painted on the Paper, it was very observable that the
Middle thereof was very much brighter than the Edges, and that there was a kind
of dark <HI>Penumbra</HI> that went round about the Limb of the same, about a 16th
part of the Diameter of the Circle; the which <HI>Penumbra</HI> could be no ways
ascribed either to the lesser Light of the Parts of the Sun near the Limb there∣of;
or to any thing defective in the make of the Hole or Passage through which
it was admitted; but to some other Cause, or Propriety of Light, which I shall
hereafter explain.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Proper∣ty of Light dis∣covered.</NOTE> Having observed this, at about the distance of two Inches
I let in another Cone of Light, and receiving the Bases of them upon a Piece of
Paper, at such a distance from the Holes, as that the Circles did intersect each
other; I did manifestly observe, that there was not only a <HI>Penumbra</HI> or darker
Ring incompassing the lighter Circle, but a manifest dark Line or Circle, which
did manifestly appear even where the Limb of the one interfered with the Limb
of the other.</P>
<P>As in the Figure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plate 2. Fig. 7.</NOTE> where <HI>a b c g h, a d c k l</HI> represent the Bases of those Cones
of Light, whose middle Parts <HI>ii ii oo oo,</HI> appear brighter; but the Parts thereof
next the Limb, <HI>e e e e, u u u u,</HI> appear much darker, with a kind of <HI>Penumbra,</HI>
or Faintness of Light; and the extream Circumference, or terminating Lines of
each, appear perfect dark Strokes; nay though the parts thereof <HI>a b c</HI> and <HI>a d c</HI>
intermix with the brighter Parts of the other Base, as at <HI>b</HI> and <HI>d.</HI> Examining
the bigness of this Base with the distance of it from the <HI>Apex</HI> or Hole, I found
it no ways answer to that Proportion it ought to have, supposing the lateral Rays
from opposite Parts of the Limb of the Sun's Disk, did intersect each other in
the above-mentioned Hole, and did proceed on by strait Lines to the Paper or
Base; but according to the various bignesses of the Holes, and according to the
various distances of the Receiving Papers from those Holes, so were the Pro∣portions
of the Diameters of those Circles to their Distances varied: Which in
Astronomical Inquiries will produce no small Errors, if not carefully prevented
by proper Remedies. I proceeded farther to make Experiments concerning the
Nature of Light; and holding an opacous Body between the Hole or <HI>Apex,</HI> and
the Base or Paper, I observed that there was, notwithstanding all the care I used
to exclude other Light than what came in by that single Hole, a certain faint
Light cast even into the Shadow of the Body; and in that part of the lucid part
of the Base, which was not shaded by the opaque Body, there was a certain
<HI>Fascia</HI> or Zone of Light which went parallel along with the terminating Line
of the Shadow of the opacous dark Body; the which Zone of Light was
manifestly much lighter than any part of the lucid Base besides. Nay this lucid
Zone did not only cross the Circle of the Base, but did manifestly proceed and
extend it self a good way beyond the lucid Circle of the Base, striking pretty
far into the incompassing opaque <HI>Medium.</HI> To make this more evident to you
by a Scheme, let O represent the Hole in the Shutter of the Window, through
which the Light of the Sun is let pass:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plate 2. Fig. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> Let CON represent the Cone of Light
transmitted, and PA the Paper upon which the Circle or Basis of the Cone is
cast: Let BB represent the opaque Body interposed between the Hole and the
Papers, and SS TT the Shadow thereof upon the Paper. That which I obser∣ved
was this: The Shadow of the opaque Body BB was somewhat all over
inlightned, but seem'd most inlightned towards the Edge thereof. Several Per∣sons
<PB N="188" REF="226"/>
that were present, and saw and diligently observed these <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> con∣ceived
and objected, that the lucid Zone, or brighter part, which edged the
Shadow of the opaque Body, was produced by some kind of Reflection from
the Side of the said Body by which the Light passed; it being indeed a round
Body, and so some of the Rays might possibly reflect, so as to fall upon the lu∣cid
Zone: But I could see no reason why it should not as much inlighten any
other part of the bright Base or Figure of the Sun on the Paper; for the shad∣ing
Body being only a round Piece of Wood, not bright and polisht, nor of so
certain a Reflection, as to direct the Rays that fell on it exactly to a determi∣nate
Place, I could not conceive any reason why that should produce such a lu∣cid
Zone. Others supposed that it might proceed from some Reflection of the
Brass Hole through which the Light was admitted into the Room. But to ob∣viate
both these Objections, and to inquire farther into the Nature of this <HI>Phae∣nomenon,</HI>
I placed instead of the Cylinder of Wood, a very sharp and smooth
edged Razor, so that the Edge of the Razor was that which cast the strait Line
of Shadow which divided the lucid Base; from which there could be no Re∣flection,
at least so very little, that if we do suppose a Flatness or Breadth in
the Edge thereof, it could not amount to a 500th part of the breadth of the lu∣cid
Zone; and consequently there could be no imaginary Reason drawn from the
Reflection thereof to solve the <HI>Phaenomena:</HI> And it was believed that the Ap∣pearance
would have been considerably differing, but upon trial thereof, the
same <HI>Phaenomena</HI> were as observable as before, without any sensible Variety. The
same Appearance also was visible, when instead of the Razor, a piece of Past∣board
was used for an opaque Body. And to obviate the other Objection, in∣stead
of the piece of Brass placed in the Shutter, which by a Hole in it let in
the Light, there was placed a piece of Pastboard, with a small black Hole burnt
through it: But upon trying over all the aforesaid Experiments with it, we
found the very same Appearances as when the Light passed through the piece of
Brass. So that upon the whole matter it was very manifest, that it was some
new Propriety of Light much differing from the common Rules and Laws there∣of
deliver'd in Optical and Physical Writers. Having discovered these Proprie∣ties,
I proceeded farther to examine into the Nature of Light, by placing the
Razor as before, so as to divide the Cone of Light into two Parts, the trans∣mitting
Hole remaining as before: And I placed the Paper (exposed to receive
the Circle of the Base) so as that none of the enlightned part of the Circle fell
thereupon, but only the Shadow of the Razor or opaque Body; and to my
wonder, I found a very brisk and visible Radiation striking down upon the Pa∣per,
of the same breadth with the Diameter of the lucid Circle, or at least (if
the Shadow did not divide the Circle into two equal Parts) as big as the Sub∣tense
made on the said Circle by the Shadow; and this Radiation always struck
perpendicularly from the said Line of Shadow, and did not only extend so far
as the bredth of the remaining part of the Circle; but like the Light or Tail
of a Comet, extended more than 10 times that length, and in probability more
than a 100 times; nay, as far as I could find by many Trials, the Light from the
Edge did strike downards into the Shadow very near to a Quadrant, though still
I found, that the greater the Deflection of this new Light was from the direct
Radiations of the Cone, the more faint they were.</P>
<P>It was hereupon objected by some, that this Deflection of the Light was to
be ascribed either to the Reflection of the Particles of Dust flying to and fro in
the Air of the lucid Cone, or to some kind of Transparency and Refraction in
the Edge of the Rasor.</P>
<P>But to obviate these Objections, I took care first so to hide that part of the lu∣cid
Cone that was between the Hole and the Razor, that little or nothing thereof
could come to shine on that part where the Radiation appeared: And next by
changing the Sides of the Razor, I placed the thick Back thereof instead of the
Edge:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Effect wholly to be ascribed to a new Property of Light.</NOTE> So that if there were any thing ascribable either to the Transparency, or
Figure and Superficies thereof, all those Proprieties might be altered, and con∣sequently
the Effects producible thereby: But upon all the variety of Changes
and Alterations and Examinations of it, this way and that way, I found the
Effects and <HI>Phaenomena</HI> the same; so that it was manifest, that the Effect was
ascribable wholly to a new Propriety of the Rays of Light, and not at all to
<PB N="189" REF="227"/>
any Reflection or Refraction, or any other common Propriety of Light.</P>
<P>I proceeded yet farther to examine into the Nature of Light,<NOTE PLACE="marg">These Radia∣tions of Light might be mo∣ved.</NOTE> and finding
that there were several brighter Parts of this Radiation into the Shadow, and
others that were darker and more obscure, and that they did all strike perpen∣dicularly
into the Shadow; and finding also that these brighter and darker Parts
would be moved to and fro, and disappear, and other new ones appear, accord∣ing
as I moved and slipt the Razor or shadowing Body to and fro: After several
Trials I found, that wheresoever there was a part of the shadowing Body more
high than the rest of the Superficies, there the Radiation into the Shadow was
brighter and more strong; and wheresoever there was a Notch or Gap in the said
Superficies, there a darker Stroke or Radiation would be: Insomuch that if I
fixt upon the Side of the shadowing Body, a Piece of Lead, or the like (whe∣ther
reflecting or not reflecting Body, 'twas the same thing) there would strike
a brisk Radiation from the Shadow thereof into the Shadow of the opaque Body
perdendicularly to the Line of Shadow. If the Superficies or Bulk of the Knob
was considerably big, the Radiation would strike perpendicularly to the Sides
thereof; so that if the shadowing Body were circular, it would strike towards
a Center; and if it were concave, it would strike with Radiations, as it were,
from a Center: If it were a sharp Angle, or Corner, it would strike by a Line
dividing the Angle into two equal Parts. This also, after several Examinations
and Trials thereof, by varying Experiments, I found to be ascribable to a new
Propriety of the Rays of Light, and not at all to Reflections or Refractions, or
any other commonly known Propriety of Light.</P>
<P>Proceeding farther to make Observations of the bigness of the Figure of the
Sun, painted by the Rays of Light admitted through the small Hole in the
Brass Plate, upon the Table or Paper exposed to receive them; I observed that
the Limb of that Figure was always much darker than the middle Parts, and
that it was not only darker, but ragged, and not neatly and distinctly defined,
by reason of a kind of <HI>Penumbra</HI> which fringed the edge thereof. Comparing
this <HI>Penumbra</HI> with the bigness of the Hole in the Plate through which the Light
was admitted, I found that it was considerably broader than that, sometimes
five or six times as broad; so that I was sufficiently satisfied that it could not
proceed from a <HI>Penumbra</HI> caused by the bigness of the Hole upon the common
Principles, that is, from the Supposition of the Rays from every point of the Sun
proceeding in strait Lines: For had that been supposed, the <HI>Penumbra</HI> could
not have been broader than the Diameter of the admitting Hole, as it will be
made very evident, if we examine the Progress of the Rays Geometrically,
supposing them to move always exactly in strait Lines.</P>
<P>Let SN in the 9th Scheme represent the Diameter of the Sun shining through
the Hole HO,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plate 2. Fig. 9.</NOTE> and painting upon the Table TT the round Figure of the Sun,
whose Diameter suppose is DI, terminated by the Rays SOI and NHD, pro∣ceeding
from the Extreams of the Sun's Diameter SN, to the opposite Sides of
the Hole HO. Draw then from the Extremes of the Sun's Diameter S and N,
two other Rays, SM and NE, passing by the corresponding Sides of the Hole H
and O, and terminating at the Table or Paper at M and E; which last Rays,
with the preceding, will cut off from the shining Circle of the Sun MI and ED.
And because of the vast Distance of the Body of the Sun from us, those Rays
which we have here drawn diverging, will notwithstanding be Physically and
sensibly parallel; and consequently the breadth of the <HI>Penumbra</HI> MI and DE,
must be equal to HO the Diameter of the Hole, by the 34 <HI>pr. 1st Euclid.</HI> the Pa∣per
or Table being supposed parallel to the Diameter of the Hole HO; or if we
will proceed according to the strictness of Geometry, the Breadth of the <HI>Penum∣bra</HI>
MI will be so much greater than the Diameter of the Hole HO, as the Di∣stance
SI is to the Distance SO. For as SI is to SO, so is MI to HO, by the 4th of
the sixth of <HI>Euclid;</HI> the which Proportion being, as to the greatest accurateness
of Sense, a Proportion of Equality, it follows that the <HI>Penumbra</HI> of the Disk
must be equal, as to all sense, to the Diameter of the Hole; and to make the
<HI>Penumbra</HI> double to the Diameter of the Hole, the Distance of the Hole and
Paper must be equal to the Distance of the Sun from the Hole; that is, as SI is
double to SO, so will MI be double to MO. It follows therefore that this ex∣traordinary
<HI>Penumbra</HI> can no way be ascribable to the common Principles of
<PB N="190" REF="228"/>
Light, but to some new P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>opriety, whereby the Light doth deflect from strait
Lines, contrary to what is hitherto asserted by Optick Writers. Nor will the
bright Zone which I mention'd, be explicable by any of the common Rules of
Opticks: For according to the common Principles of Opticks, all the Parts of
the shining or light Picture of the Sun, which lie between M and E, must be
equally inlightned; that is, supposing the Light to proceed only by right Lines:
For every Point between E and M will be inlightned by an equal Spuce of the
Diameter of the Sun. From the Point E of the Sun draw the Line EHL; then
shall LN represent such a part of the Diameter of the Sun, as can at once in∣lighten
the Point E through the Hole. Then take any other Point in the Picture
of the Sun between M and E, as suppose the Point C, and from the Point C
draw two Lines touching the Extreams of the Diameter of the Hole H and O;
that is to say, CHB and COA, terminating at the Points B and A of the Sun;
I say, that BA shall be equal to LN. For since SN, HO, and TT are Parallels,
HC will be to BC, as HE to LE. But as HE to LE, so is HO to LN; and as
HC to BC, so is HO to BA. Therefore as HO is to LN, so is HO to BA; and
consequently BA and LN are equal; and consequently every Point of the Picture
of the Sun painted by the Rays on the Table TT, between the Points E and M,
ought to be equally inlightned by the Rays passing through the Hole HO; since
every of them is inlightned by an equal part of the Diameter of the Sun's Dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k,
which is contrary to the Observations that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have made; and therefore the Rays
of the Sun which cross each other in the Hole of the Shutter HO, do not pro∣ceed
on in strait Lines, but deflect, some this way, some that way, as I shall
hereafter more at large declare, when I shall shew divers other <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trange <HI>Phaenomena</HI>
of Light, both in Direct, Reflected and Refracted Rays; whereby are produ∣ced
Colours, Light and Heat, and various Pictures of the Objects without:
For according to this or that Variety of the quantity of Light admitted, so would
the Effects be exceedingly differing as to Light, Heat and Colours. And I also
further observed, that the widening or streightning of the Hole would alter the
<HI>Penumbra,</HI> and that a smaller Hole would make a larger <HI>Penumbra,</HI> which is
contrary to the common Principles of Opticks: For if the Rays went in strait
Lines, the bigger the Hole were, the bigger would be the <HI>Penumbra.</HI> These
things I have deliver'd to you as briefly and succinctly as I could. The other
<HI>Phaenomena,</HI> God willing, I shall hereafter deliver to you more at large.</P>
<P>“IN reference to the foregoing Experiment of Light, I found a Paper to this
purpose. On the 18th of <HI>March</HI> 1674-75 Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> read a Discourse con∣cerning
the Nature and Properties of Light, in which was contained several
new Properties of Light not observed, that he knew, by any Optick Writers:
These were, That there is a Deflection of Light differing both from Reflection
and Refraction, and seeming to depend upon the unequal Density of the con∣stituent
Parts of the Ray, whereby the Light is dispersed from the Place of
Condensation, and ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ify'd or gradually diverged into a Quadrant. 2dly, He
observed that this Deflection is made toward the Superficies of the op<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cous
Body perpendicularly. 3dly, That in this Deflection of the Rays, those Parts
of diverged Radiation that are deflected by the greatest Angle from the strait or
direct Radiations▪ are faintest, and those that are deflected by the least, are
strongest. 4ly, That the Rays cutting each o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ehr in one common <HI>Foramen,</HI>
do not make the Angles <HI>ad Verticem</HI> equal. 5ly, That Colours may be made
without Refraction, 6ly, That the true bigness of the Sun's Diameter cannot
be taken with common Sights. 7ly, That the same Rays of Light falling
upon the same point of the Object, will turn into all sorts of Colours only
by the various Inclination of the Object. 8ly, That Colours begin to appear,
when two Pulses of Light are blended so well and near together, that the
Sense takes them for one.</P>

this <HI>Medium,</HI> are those we call Magnetical, <HI>viz.</HI> Loadstones and Iron, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
which are homogenious or unisonous, or equally great with the Magnetick, or

<P>The Cause of this Motion is first from the Circular Motion of the Body of the

<HEAD>This Discourse gives an Explication of a Glade of Light
first observed in the Heavens by Dr. Childrey,
about the Vernal Aequinox, and by Mons. Cas∣sini
and others. This Lecture was read before the
Royal Society, June the 3d 1685.</HEAD>
<P>DOctor <HI>Childrey,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Page 183.</NOTE> at the End of his <HI>Britannia Baconica,</HI> which he pulished in
the Year 1660, containing several very curious Observations made by him∣self
and others, has this Advertisement to the Curious and Ingenious. There is
a thing which I must needs recommend to the Observation or Mathematical
Men, which is, that in <HI>February,</HI> and for a little before, and a little after that
Month (as I have observed several Years together) about 6 in the Evening, when
the Twilight hath almost deferred the Horizon, you shall see a plainly discern∣able
way of the Twilight striking up toward the <HI>Pleiades,</HI> or Seven Stars, and
seeming almost to touch them. It is to be observed any cle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Night. There is
no such Way to be observed at any other time of the Year, that I can perceive,
nor any other Way at that time to be perceived da<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting up elsewhere. And I
believe it hath been and will be constantly visible at that time of the Year: But
what the Cause of it in Nature should be, I cannot yet imagine. So far the Doctor
discoursing with this Gentleman about a Year or two after this Publication, he
could not then think of any Cause of it, unless perhaps it might be some
extraordinary Reflection of the Sun Beams, caused by some part of the Western
Ocean; but could not be positive, but doubted whether this might be a Cause
or not. This Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct of Dr. <HI>Childrey</HI>'s was translated into <HI>French,</HI> and printed in
the Year 1667, as appears by the <HI>Mis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ellanea Curiosa Academi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Naturae Curio∣sorum;</HI>
and by that means the Advertisement was spread in <HI>France,</HI> and the rest
of <HI>Europe.</HI> In the 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th Journal <HI>des Scauans</HI> of the Year 1683. we have an Ac∣count
of a Sight the most rare that has been observed in the Heavens, descri∣bed
by Mr. <HI>Cassini</HI> thus.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Cassini's</HI> Observations.</NOTE> “A Light, like that which blanches the Milky Way,
but more clear and shining in the middle, but more faint towards the Ex∣treams,
was expanded over those Signs which the Sun was shortly to pass
through. I began to see it at the <HI>Royal Observatory,</HI> the 18th of <HI>March St. N.</HI>
two Days before the <HI>Aequinox,</HI> upon the occasion of turning the Telescope
(with which I had been viewing the Changes of <HI>Saturn</HI>) to see the 1st Star
of <HI>Aries,</HI> which is composed of two, distant only the Sum of their Dia∣meters.
I saw this Constellation, and that of <HI>Taurus</HI> more light than ordi∣nary,
about ¾ after 7 of the Clock, which was ½ an hour after the Evening
Twilight. The West End of this Light was terminated by Horizon Clouds
about 3 Degrees high, the Breadth of the clearest part was about 8 or 9
Degrees: It was extended obliquely near the <HI>Zodiac,</HI> and sheer'd by the North
side of the two brightest Stars in the Head of <HI>Aries,</HI> comprehending all the
Body. It extended in Length over the 7 Stars, and ended insensibly in the
Head of <HI>Taurus.</HI> That part of the Heaven was so very clear, that Stars of
the 6th and 7th Magnitude could be plainly seen, even in the middle of it,
which was the brightest, as is sometimes seen in the Tails of Comets. But
'twas too great for the Tail of a Comet, tho' it respected the Sun, and descen∣ded
behind the Clouds, without altering its Situation among the Stars. It
continued to appear for some Days, but alter'd not its Position, tho' it grew
fainter by degrees. The 26th of <HI>March (St. N.)</HI> which was the last
Night he then saw it) it seemed to be moved somewhat more towards the
North than at first, which some Observations of it in <HI>April</HI> following farther
confirmed. I pass over his comparing of it to other <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> because I
take them to be of another nature. As for the Cause of it, he takes it to be
either from the Head of some Comet hid under the Sun's Rays, which yet he
<PB N="194" REF="232"/>
doubts to assert, because of its Breadth, or from the Sun's Body it self; but
determines nothing. He takes its Distance to be great, approaching towards
the Fixed Stars, above the Planets, because it chang'd its Place so very little
in the time it appear'd.”</P>
<P>In the <HI>Nouvelles des Livres</HI> of <HI>March</HI> last, is inserted a Letter of Mr. <HI>Choi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et,</HI>
Professor of Philosophy at <HI>Geneva,</HI> giving a further Account of the Observation
of it at that Place the last Spring, <HI>viz.</HI> 1684. by Mr. <HI>Fatio de Duillier,</HI> to this
effect. “That 'tis a great Light, like the Tail of some Comet, whose Head
is absconded in the Sun's Rays, appearing sometime in the West, sometime in
the East, after and before the Twilight, but always near the Sun. '<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is al∣ways
near the Plain of the Ecliptick, and respects the Sun. The End next
the Sun is about 14 Degrees broad, at about 40 Degrees from the Sun, and
from thence goes about 30 Degrees farther, diminishing in Breadth and Bright∣ness,
and ending in almost a Point. It is brightest through the middle, yet
even through that small Stars may be seen.”</P>
<P>This admirable Appearance, says he, was first observed by the Illustrious
<HI>Cassini</HI> in <HI>March</HI> and <HI>April</HI> 1683, where Mr. <HI>Fatio</HI> was present and assistant in the
Observation: And returning to <HI>Geneva,</HI> he observed it in <HI>March,</HI> but was much
surprized to find it again by chance in <HI>Feb.</HI> 1684. which made him frame the
following <HI>Hypothesis, viz.</HI> that he was in part of the same Opinion with Mr.
<HI>Cassini,</HI> that the Light was caused by some more reflecting or refracting Parts
expanded into the Aether in that place which conveyed the Sun's Beams to our
Sight: But differ'd also from him, 1st, In that Mr. <HI>Fatio</HI> supposes it spread about
the Sun's Body most about the Plain of the Ecliptick, extending far beyond the
Orb of <HI>Venus,</HI> and even almost to the Orb of the Earth. 2ly, In that he sup∣poses
this Luminous Matter about the Sun not to be a Globe, but only a taper∣ing
Circle in the Plain of the Ecliptick: So that it is much thicker near the Sun,
where it doth to a great thickness inclose him; but as it spreads further and fur∣ther
from it, so it grows thinner. 3ly, That this Matter is carried round about
the Sun by the Motion of the Heavens, in the Plain of the Ecliptick, and termi∣nates
at the Orb of <HI>Venus.</HI></P>
<P>To make out which <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> he affirms to have seen the like Glade of Light
in the Morning before the Twilight in <HI>September,</HI> and both before the Morning
Twilight, and after the Evening Twilight in <HI>December.</HI> But this I do not find
observed by any one else.</P>
<P>But these Hypotheses, tho' ingenious, do not give so satisfactory an Account
of this Appearance, as I conceive; especially the first, which is indeed not limi∣ted
enough to make it de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erve the Name of an Hypothesis; and for the 2d, I
conceive no reason why it should not every Night and every Morning that is clear,
and without much Moonlight, be visible round the Year; especially in the Tor∣rid
Zone, where the Ecliptick rises more perpendicular. Which I do not find
hath been noted, nor does it appear every Year: For I my self (for two or three
Years after I first saw the beforemention'd Advertisement of Dr. <HI>Childrey,</HI> which
was, as I remember, in 1662, 1663, and 1664) looked diligently for it, but
found it not. And Dr. <HI>Childrey</HI> himself told me, that he had never found it at
any other Time of the Year: However it will be very well worth looking after.</P>
<P>Comparing all these Observations together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author's Opinion of its Cause.</NOTE> my Conjectures are, that this Ap∣pearance
is caused by some <HI>Effluvia</HI> from the Body of the Earth it self, produced
by the near Approach of it to the Sun, when in and near its <HI>Perihelium,</HI> which
<HI>Perihelium</HI> being about the 5th or 6th Degree of <HI>Taurus</HI> for the Sun's Place, or
of <HI>Cancer</HI> for the Earth's Place, is on the 16th or 17th Day of <HI>December.</HI> By
which Approach of the Body of the Earth to the Sun, I conceive that a more
than ordinary Rarifaction is made of the Parts of the <HI>Atmosphere,</HI> and the
Dimensions thereof accordingly extended to a much greater distance than at any
other times of its periodick Revolution: And the annual Motion being then also
proportionably increased in Swiftness, many of the more than ordinarily rari∣fy'd
Parts of this <HI>Atmosphere</HI> may be for a time converted into a kind of <HI>Aether,</HI>
and be thereby intimately mixed and united with it, and so be left by the swift∣ly
moving Ball in the Vicinities of its Passage through the <HI>Aether,</HI> where for
some time after it may remain perfectly ircorporated with the Parts of the
<HI>Aether:</HI> But the extraordinary Heat reflected from the Body of the Earth, hav∣ing
<PB N="195" REF="233"/>
left it for some time, these Aerial Vapours begin to lose that Form, and con∣dense
again into a Substance somewhat like the rarify'd Air, out of which they
had been generated by the Coaction of the Sun and Earth. Which Condensa∣tion
makes them of a differing Transparency from the rest of the <HI>Aether,</HI> and
thereby capable both of reflecting and refracting the Rays of the Sun passing
that way, and so make them to become visible to the Earth in that place of its
Orbit where they had been left, and so continue, till by Degrees they be disper∣sed
and scatter'd into a greater space or quantity of the <HI>Aether,</HI> and at length
wholly disappear. To make this the more conceivable, and also more sen∣sible
and probable, I could produce an Experiment in more sensible and tan∣gible
Bodies, that would perfectly represent all the Particulars remarkable
in these Observations, making use of Fire to represent the Heat of the <HI>Sun,</HI>
of <HI>Water</HI> to represent the <HI>Air</HI> or <HI>Atmosphere,</HI> and of <HI>Air</HI> to represent the
<HI>Aether;</HI> whereby the same <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> at least very similar, would be plainly
visible, respect being only had to the proportionate Differences between the Bo∣dies
representing and represented, and the Times of producing the Changes ne∣cessary
to exhibit the mention'd <HI>Phaenomena</HI> both of the one and the other Ob∣servation.
But that I think will not be necessary, since none that has made any
Observations at all, can be ignorant of them. 'Tis known to all, that Heat,
whether of the Sun, Fire, or an Animal Body, will make Water so incorporate
with the Air, as to waste away into it, without being at all visible, or altering
the Transparency of it, as we every moment are sensible of it in our Breathing.
'Tis as well known likewise, if the Air be very cold into which we breath, the
Vaporous Parts will presently condense, so as to become visible. 'Tis as well
known also, that such Vapors, if the Air be warm, do spread themselves into
the circumjacent Parts of the <HI>Aether,</HI> and will by degrees be wholly lost and
dispersed. 'Tis likewise known, if such a reaking Body be moved through the
Air, it will leave the Air through which it passes, infec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by it; which Infe∣ction
will spread laterally, and be broader than the Line of Motion. And the
like may be said of all the other <HI>Phaenomena</HI> necessary to make a sensible Repre∣sentation
of this notable Appearance.</P>
<P>Supposing then that this is the Cause of this Appearance, the Reason will be
plain, why it appears at that Place, at that time of the Year, of such a breadth
at the West end, and so sharp at the East; why of such a Length, why 'tis
brightest in the middle, why fainter towards the Edges, why extended in or near
the Plain of the Ecliptick, why it varies this way or that way, why it keeps
its place among the Stars so long, and the like; which I am ready to explain
more fully, if any Doubt.</P>
<P>Against this Hypothesis several Objections may be made, as</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> If this were the Cause of this Appearance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Objections a∣gainst the Hy∣pothesis an∣swered.</NOTE> the <HI>Atmosphere</HI> of the Earth,
and consequently the moist or watery part thereof would in time waste and
consumed, and so the World would be unfit for the Uses it was designed,
nourishing Vegetables and Animals.</P>
<P>To which I answer, that it may possibly be true, that the Moisture of the
Earth may have always for the time past, and may also at present, and for the
future, proceed to waste; and consequently the Earth may have grown drier,
and continue so to do. There is sufficient ground to believe, that a great part
of the Land that is now dry, and a considerable height above the Level of the
Sea, hath been in former Times covered by the Sea, which the Shells now
found do sufficiently evidence; and by what means it comes to be so, is not so
well known or proved. There are other Parts, as <HI>Palestine,</HI> which have in for∣mer
Times been much more succulent and fruitful than they are at present, being
now Rocky, Sandy, and Barren.</P>
<P>But secondly, To supply this Wasting, it may be alledged, that the continual
Gravity of the Earth doth make the heavier Parts thereof to get lower, and
closer together; and thereby the Watery and Aerial Parts, that have fill'd the
former Cavities and Interstities thereof, may be squeezed out into the Sea and
<HI>Atmosphere:</HI> And so as the Body of the Earth may have by this means shrunk,
<PB N="196" REF="234"/>
and be grown lesser and shrivelled; so the Watery and Atmospherical Parts
about its Surface, may in some proportion to its present bigness be supplied.</P>
<P>Thirdly, 'Tis not unlikely, but that, as the extraordinary Heat of the Sun up∣on
the Earth, when it is in its <HI>Perihelion,</HI> may for a time convert some parts of
the <HI>Atmosphere</HI> into <HI>Aether,</HI> and the extraordinary Swiftness of the Earth may
leave them behind; so the lesser Heat of the Sun upon the Earth, when in its
<HI>Aphelion,</HI> may suffer the Parts of the <HI>Aether</HI> to be converted into Air, and by the
slower Motion of the Earth in that part, be taken hold of and carried with it,
and afterwards be further converted into Water, and so repair what was lost in
the <HI>Perihelion.</HI> I shall not mention that we find further, that Waters do petri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,
and petrify'd Substances again revert into watery, that being more proper to another Head.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It may be objected, That if this were the true Cause, why should
not the like happen to the other Planets, as particularly to the Moon, whose
Glade would be seen every New Moon, especially in <HI>November, December,</HI> and <HI>January.</HI></P>
<P>To this I answer,</P>
<P>First, That 'tis not undeniably proved, that any of the primary Planets have
Water, or Atmosphere about them; and so though they may have as great or
greater Vicissitudes than the Earth in respect of the Sun; yet this Tail would
not be produced without an Aerial or Atmospherical Substance fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly prepared to
receive these Changes. And for the Moon, 'tis most probable it hath none, and
if it ever had, may have been thus wasted, and be now grown dry and rocky.</P>
<P>But secondly, Supposing they really have the same Substances about them, as
the Atmosphere is about the Earth, and that such a Tail should be really produ∣ced
by them; yet for two Reasons they could not be seen by us. The first is
from the great Distance of them from our Sight in the Primary Planets; and
secondly, the direct View of such a Tail, if it were produced by the Moon▪
For the Moon moving about the Earth, the Eye on the Earth must always look
upon such a Tail or Stream transversly, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o being but thin, cannot be seen:
But in this of the Earth, the Eye looks upon it end ways; and so, though rare of
it self, yet the Length of it being turned towards the Eye, it appears much the
more dense, and becomes visible in a dark and clear Evening.</P>
<P>This <HI>Phaenomenon</HI> I thought the more worthy consideration, because it was
first discovered and published to the World, by an <HI>English</HI> Gentleman, and be∣cause,
that if the Reason thereof be what I have here supposed, it may help
to give an account of abundance of other <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> whose Causes have been
ascribed to very differring Principles and Agents.</P>
<P>I propounded the last Wednesday an <HI>Hypothesis</HI> for the Solution of that <HI>Phae∣nomenon,</HI>
that appears in the West after the Twilight, like the Tail or Glade of
a Comet. And having since met with several other Objections against it, be∣sides
those I then answer'd, I thought it might not be impertinent to give a fur∣ther
and more compleat Explication of it; and that the rather, because I find
that several of them have proceeded from a mistaken Conception of the Theory
it self.</P>
<P>I shall therefore explain all those Particulars more exactly by Schemes and
Delineations, which may serve to give a more perfect Idea thereof.</P>
<P>The first represents the Ball of the Earth encompassed with an Atmospherical
Shell or Cover,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plate 3. Fig. 1.</NOTE> composed the greatest part of <HI>Aether,</HI> but tinctured by rarify'd
Particles of Water, Vapours or Air, which are still more rarify'd and expanded,
and fewer; and the nearer to the Nature of <HI>Aether,</HI> the further they are
distant from the Surface of the Earth.</P>
<P>The second represents this enveloped <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> by its annual Motion in a
part of its proper Orbit or Line about the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> passing through the Body
of the <HI>Aether,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 2.</NOTE> which I suppose altog<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and not moving round with

<PB N="197" REF="236"/>
it in a <HI>Vortice,</HI> as <HI>Des Cartes,</HI> supposed; but quiescent, according to that Theo∣ry
of Celestial Motions which I long since have explained and shewn to
this Society, which deduces the Cause of their periodick Motions from an im∣prest
direct Motion, and an attractive or protruding Impulse towards the Center
of the Sun.</P>
<P>By means of the swift Motion of which Body thro' this stagnant <HI>Aether,</HI> I
conceive there may be some of the higher and more rarify'd Parts of the <HI>Atmo∣sphere</HI>
left behind, and not carried along with it, they being for that time more
intimately united to the <HI>Aether;</HI> but that those Parts, after they have for some
time been separated, may alter or lose their Rarefaction, and so become for a
time visible to the Eye upon the Earth, now removed at a great distance from
them.</P>
<P>The third represents the same in the Orbit of the Earth about the Sun, shew∣ing
this Substance left in that part of the Orbit which nearest approaches the
Body of the Sun, where its Power and Heat is more intense, and where the
Motion of the Body of the Earth is much more rapid than in other Parts of its
Orbit. From which two Causes, I conceive, the Earth leaves an Impression or
Sign of its way through the <HI>Aether,</HI> somewhat like the Froth left in the Wake
of a Ship passing swiftly through the Water, which may be seen by one look∣ing
from the Poop of the Ship a good way behind, like a white Line, and has
sometimes in a dark Night appeared to shine.</P>
<P>Nor is this the only Instance; for I conceive there are very few, if any, here
present, who have not seen the shining Line left behind by the Meteors called
Falling Stars, or Star Shootings.</P>
<P>This also represents the Position or Angle of it in respect of the Sun, as also
the Length of it, and the manner how that End of it which is next the Sun,
spreads, and the other End is sharp, and hew the middle becomes more bright
and conspicuous than the rest.</P>
<P>The 4th represents the same Orbit of the Earth drawn in small, and so ma∣nifests
the Reason why that part of the Orbit appears to the Earth in <HI>Virgo</HI>
and <HI>Libra,</HI> amongst the Fixt Stars of the Constellation of <HI>Aries</HI> and <HI>Taurus.</HI></P>
<P>The right understanding of this Theory will plainly shew a Reason why it
had so little, if any Parallax at all; which made <HI>Cassini</HI> suppose it higher than
the Planets, and <HI>Chouet</HI> that it was about the Sun: For by the Scheme it plainly
appears, that it must be for the most part of it further distant than the Sun.</P>
<P>The chief Objections that I have since met with are these.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Objecti∣ons answered.</NOTE></P>
<P>1. How the <HI>Aether,</HI> which is so exceeding thin and fluid a Body, can detain or
stop any part of the Atmosphere in the Transit of the Ear<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, and why the Gra∣vity
of the Earth, which carries along with it the Moon, according to my
Theory, which is so vastly much more distant, should not be able to carry with
it all the Parts of the Atmosphere.</P>
<P>2. Tho' the <HI>Aether</HI> should thus retain part of the Atmosphere, as I suppose,
yet why this retained Substance should not appear sooner, and how it should
continue so long after, without being wholly dispersed into the <HI>Aether.</HI></P>
<P>3. Why this Separation, or marked Way, should be left only when the Earth
is in its <HI>Perihelion,</HI> and not all the Year, in every part of its Orbit.</P>
<P>4. Why this Glade should not appear the same every Year, since the Earth
moves the same Trace through the same <HI>Aether;</HI> and so at the same Times or
Places of its Orbit, it has the same Influences both from the Sun and the <HI>Aether.</HI></P>
<P>To the first I answer, That tho' the <HI>Aether</HI> be exceeding fluid, yet both from
Observation and Experiments it affords some Resistance to Bodies moved through
it. First by Observation it has been, I think, always found that the Tail, Blaze
or Glade of Comets, has not been exactly directed or pointed from the Sun, but
hath always had an Inclination backwards, that is, towards the Place from
whence the Comet is moved, as I have published in my Observations concerning
Comets; the Blaze of a Comet in this somewhat resembling the Ascent of the
<PB N="198" REF="237"/>
Flame of a Candle, when it is moved sideways through the Air. But secondly,
by experiment we find, that though the Motion of a <HI>Pendulum in vacuo</HI> will
be much more free, and last a considerable time longer than the Motion of a
<HI>Pendulum in pleno A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re;</HI> yet even this will in some short time also lose its Mo∣tion,
and stand still, as I have manifested to this Society by former Experiments
purposely made. 3ly, Tho' the gravitating or attracting Power of the Earth be
able to retain and carry the Moon along with it in its annual Orbit, the Moon
being a Body of a vast Bulk or Solidity, compar'd to the Fluidity and small
Resistance of the <HI>Aether</HI> through which it moves: Yet, as I shall afterwards
prove in my Theory of Lunar Motions, the Impediment of the <HI>Aether</HI> hath a
very considerable Influence upon it, and produceth very sensible Effects, tho' they
are ascribed to differing Causes. But on the other hand, the Solidity of the
Parts which serve to exhibit this <HI>Phaenomenon,</HI> are so very small, and so near
approaching to the Nature of the <HI>Aether,</HI> that the Stagnancy of the <HI>Aether</HI> hath
a considerable Influence and Effect upon them.</P>
<P>For answer to the 2d Objection, 1st, I say, that I suppose it when separated
from the Atmosphere, to be so near of the same Nature of the <HI>Aether</HI> with which
it is mixed, that it discovers not its essential Difference, till it hath been for
some time separated from the Atmosphere; but then when the Reflective Influ∣ence
of the Earth hath been for some time wanting to it, It doth by degrees
re-assume its preceding Form, and by degrees revert into the Form of Air, Va∣pours
or Water, and so becomes of a differing Nature from the <HI>Aether,</HI> and
serves to reflect the Rays of the Sun towards the Earth.</P>
<P>2ly, The Nearness of its Qualification to the <HI>Aether,</HI> makes it more slow in
altering its Form. Of this we have Instances enough in the Atmosphere in a
dry Season, as at this present, when though the Air be plen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ully charged with
watery Vapours and Exhalations, yet they continue for a long time in the form
of the Air, being not discoverable from the more permanent Body of the Air it
self, by any difference of Refractiveness, till by some other Cause unknown, they
be converted again into the Form of Water in small Globules, or Drops, and so
appear in form so Clouds, many of which Drops uniting into one, form a Drop of
Rain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Rain.</NOTE> and so fall down to the Earth. This unknown Cause seems to be some∣times
extraordinary Heat, whereby one part is converted into Lightning, upon
which another presently reverts into Water or Rain, and falls down in Thunder
Showers. At other times it seems to be extraordinary Cold,, as one may judge
by the falling down of those Drops in the form of Ice, as in Hail Showers.</P>
<P>3ly, If we consider the vast height from the Surface of the Earth, to which the Parts of the Atmosphere ascend, which exhibit the Twilight, which <HI>Cardan</HI>
believes to be almost 800 Miles, tho' <HI>Ricciolus,</HI> and others more moderate, sup∣pose
it not above 100 Miles high; we may easily assent, that some of those
Parts may be left in the <HI>Aether,</HI> considering the Stagnancy of the <HI>Aether,</HI> and
the exceeding great Swiftness of the solid Globe of the Earth through the same.
But then if we consider the Parts of the Atmosphere not Refractive, they may
be supposed very much more elevated, even to the height of a Diameter of the
Earth. But if they are supposed less than 50, which the most moderate allow,
yet they will be high enough to be left behind by the swiftly moving Ball of
the Earth.</P>
<P>To the Third Objection, why this Train or Stream should be left when
the Earth is in its <HI>Perihelium,</HI> and not as well at all other Times and Places
of its Revolution, I answer, That there being a manifest difference of a
Cause 'tis rational enough to suppose there may be a sensible difference
of Effect. 'Tis by other ways proved that the Earth is in that part of its
Orbit nearer the Sun, and that its Motion is then and there proportionably
swifter; if then we can observe a different <HI>Phaenomenon,</HI> 'tis rational to ascribe
it to that different Cause, till a more certain be found. Now that such a Cause
may have some considerable Influence, I shall produce an Observation of the
before-mentioned Dr.<HI>Childrey,</HI> in the same Book, <HI>viz.</HI> his <HI>Britannia Baconica,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Moon's Influ∣ence on Flo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds.</NOTE>

in favour of my Opinion touching the Moon in <HI>Perigeo,</HI> her greatning the

“That in the Year 1551 and 1552, <HI>Jan.</HI> 13th; that horrible one 1570, on <HI>All
Saints</HI> Day, the first of <HI>November;</HI> and that notable one 1606-07, <HI>Jan.</HI> 30th,
the greatest that ever was known in <HI>Severn,</HI> and so fatal to <HI>Somersetshire,
Glocestershire,</HI> and <HI>Monmouthshire;</HI> they were all when the Moon was in
<HI>Perigeo,</HI> as he that lists to calculate, or search the <HI>Ephemerides</HI> for those
Years, will find.” And the same Doctor, in the beginning of his Book, adds
an Advertisement of an Observation he made before that Book was quite prin∣ted
off, <HI>viz.</HI> “That on the 1st of <HI>November</HI> 1660, between 10 a Clock at
Night, and 5 next Morning, happen'd an unusual shifting of the Tides in the
<HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>London</HI> ebbing and flowing three times, as 'tis reported, in that
space; which, says he, was when the Moon was almost in the very place▪ of
her <HI>Perigaeum.</HI></P>
<P>To which let me add one Observation more to the Doctor's, That all these
<HI>Phaenomena</HI> hapned when the Earth was very near its <HI>Perihelium,</HI> and within the
Limits of this supposed Luminous Glade or Wake, as I may call it, of the
Earth; and 'tis not impossible but that this greater Nearness of the Body of the
Earth to the Fire of the Sun, may make it emit more copious, and other na∣tured
Steams than at other times, when not so much roasted by the Heat of the
Sun.</P>
<P>As to the 4th Objection, why this should not appear every Year the same, I
answer, that there may be many Causes or Reasons to make one Year conside∣rably
differ from another, as is sufficiently manifest by the Variety of Weather of
one Year from another. But to determine positively what is the Cause, does
require a greater number, and more exact Observations than have been hitherto
made of it.</P>
<P>Having understood that there yet remains one Objection against the <HI>Hypothesis,</HI>
I have prouposed for solving the Glade of Light appearing in the West in <HI>Februa∣ry,
March,</HI> and <HI>April;</HI> and that is, against the Stagnancy of the <HI>Aether,</HI> and
its staying of Atmospherical Parts within it from following the Motion of the
Earth. I shall thereupon mention two <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> which I conceive, when they are
well considered, will give some probable Argument for this Opinion; and those
are two of the same Kind or Nature, but observed at different Times and Pla∣ces.
The first I sshall mention,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of a Lampas Volans.</NOTE> tho' the last in time, was the Fax or <HI>Lampas
Volans</HI> observed after Sun-set the 1st: of <HI>March</HI> 1676, at <HI>Fau—by Petrus de
Lauina;</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI> by Mons. <HI>Auzout;</HI> at <HI>Florence</HI> by <HI>Matthias del Arpi;</HI> at <HI>Ve∣nice</HI>
by <HI>Jo. Jacob Hertz,</HI> and in several other Cities of <HI>Italy;</HI> in all which it
was seen also by very many others, and at the same time also was observed in
the Lower Parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> as at <HI>Triers</HI> by the <HI>Jesuits</HI> there; Places very far
distant one from another; yet the Time and Manner of Appearance in all was
much the same. It seemed to rise out of the North East, and to pass by the
Meridian to the South Western Parts of the Heavens, near the same Tract that
the Sun had gone that Day, and disappeared behind thick Clouds, where with
a mighty Noise it was supposed to be blown to pieces and dispersed. It ap∣peared
about the bigness of the Full Moon, and left behind it a Tail about 3
Diameters, of a reddish Flame at first, but turning bluish towards the last. It
lasted about a Minute or two. Its Noise at last was like the Noise of an Earth∣quake
at a distance, and made the Glass in the Windows shake. From the
comparing of several Observations, 'twas supposed about 90 Miles high, and
near a Mile in Diameter. The several Authors that have writ concerning it,
have explicated it by an Hypothesis very different from mine. My Conceptions
of it are these.</P>
<P>First, That it was a vaporous Steam much of the same nature with that which
makes Lightning raised into the Superior Parts of the Air by means of its own
<PB N="200" REF="239"/>
innate Heat and Rarefraction, which might possibly proceed from some subter∣raneous
Operation in some Parts of the East lying far distant from <HI>Italy,</HI> as <HI>China,</HI>
or some other Part where there might be some Earthquake, or possibly some Ir∣ruption,
by which it might be sent out in great plenty, and forced up with
great Power and Swiftness, that remaining there some time, it might from the
Cold or want of Heat of those higher Regions, by degrees be condensed and
conglobated nearer together, and by the Operation of the more Aethereal part
of the Atmosphere, be prepared for Accension; and so being kindled, it would
continue some small time before it set fire to the middle Parts thereof, at which
time it seemed to imitate the Noise of Thunder afar off. Now that Particular
for which I mention it, is the way of its apparent Motion, which was said to be
much the same with the Sun that Day, rising Eastward, and passing by the Me∣ridian
towards the West. This, I conceive, was caused by the Diurnal Motion
of the Earth, whereby the Parts where it was seen being moved very swiftly
towards the East, <HI>viz.</HI> about 12 or 14 Miles in a Minute, the higher Parts of
the Atmosphere in which it was kindled, being left behind, it appeared as if it
had been carried by a swift Motion of its own from East to West. And by rea∣son,
I suppose, that even that part of the Atmosphere was moved a little to∣wards
the East, thence was the Appearance of the Tail or Blaze it had that way,
of about 3 times its own Diameter: Which will, I conceive, give a probable
Cause of its apparent rapid Motion, and very well agree with the Hypothes I
lately mentioned.</P>
<P>And the same <HI>Hypothesis</HI> will solve a like <HI>Phaenomenon,</HI> which, as well as I
can remember, was some 10 Years before observed, both here in <HI>England,</HI> and
in <HI>Holland.</HI> It was seen by Sir <HI>Robert Murray,</HI> if I misremember not, and by
Mr. <HI>Shortgrave,</HI> and I think also by Mons. <HI>Hugens</HI> in <HI>Holland.</HI> It was as big as
the <HI>Italian</HI> Meteor, and was judged to be of an exceeding great height in the
Atmosphere, being seen at Places so far distant at the same time. It appeared
first about the North East, and passed by the North West, not rising, as I remem∣ber,
so high as 10 Degrees above the Horizon. For supposing that in the same
manner to beleft behind by the swiftly moving Parts of the Earth, the <HI>Phaeno∣mena</HI>
will be very naturally solved; and therefore deserve, I conceive, to be
taken notice of in the History of Nature.</P>

<HEAD>An Account of Dr. Isaac Vossius's Hypothesis of
GRAVITATION, with some Animadver∣sions
thereupon.</HEAD>
<P>HAving perus'd a Discourse of the Learned Dr. <HI>Vossius,</HI> wherein he endea∣vours
to explain the true Reason and Cause of the <HI>Gravitation</HI> of Bo∣dies
towards the Center of the Earth, I thought it might not be unacceptable
to give an account of my Thoughts concerning it, it being a Subject well worthy
the consideration of this Society, there having not been to this day any one
<HI>Hypothesis</HI> given by any Writer, that is sufficient to solve the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> thereof,
or to explain the Multitude of Effects produced by it, much less to demon∣strate
the Power and Limits thereof, concerning which I have heretofore some∣what
more largely discoursed in this Assembly. I shall not now spend time in
the enumeration of the various <HI>Hypotheses</HI> of several other Authors, but confine
my self only to the consideration of that which is propounded by this Worthy
and Ingenious Person. He conceives then, that the sole reason why heavy Bo∣dies
descend towards the Center of the Earth, and why light Bodies ascend from
it, is the Diurnal Rotation, thereof upon its <HI>Axis,</HI> and wonders that it was ne∣ver
found out before, even by those who patronized the <HI>Copernican Pythagorick</HI>
(or, as he affirms, the <HI>Chaldean</HI> and <HI>Egyptian</HI> Opinion, long before <HI>Pythagoras)</HI>
of the Motion of the Earth. The Reasons he assigns, why this Motion must
infallibly and necessarily produce this Effect, is because heavy Bodies having an
inaptitude to Motion, do therefore endeavour towards the Center, where there
is none, or the least that can be. This he explains by two sorts of Experiments
tried or observed by him; the first is that of a <HI>Vortex,</HI> or Whirl of Water in a
large Tub, the second that of a large Top. By the first, he says, he found that
the Water being put into a swift Circular Motion, all those Bodies which were
heavy, and sunk to the bottom, were drawn to the middle, and the heaviest of
them got nearest to the Center, and those less heavy were removed farther and
farther off, according to their proportionate Degree of Gravity, as Lead would get
nearest, Iron next, then Stones, or other less heavy Bodies. On the other side,
such Bodies as were lighter than the Water, and so swam upon it, would
recede and fly off to the Sides of the Tub. The like <HI>Phaenomena</HI> he observed
also in Whirlwinds of the Air. His second Experiment of the Top, he produces
to answer some Objections which are usually made against the Motion of the
Earth, and so will consequently be against this <HI>Hypothesis:</HI> For 'tis usually, says
he, objected, that if the Earth move, then all such Bodies as are loose upon it,
would be so far from growing more heavy towards the Center, that they would
all of them be rather thrown off into the Air or <HI>Aether</HI> with a great violence,
and tend outwards or upwards from it, since 'tis plain, that a Body put into a
Wheel, and turned swiftly round, has a tendency from the Center, and not at
all to it. For, saith he, tho' it be true, that a Wheel turned thus perpendicu∣larly,
do's cause the heavy Body to recede; yet if the Wheel were moved Hori∣zontally,
as a Top is, with its <HI>Axis</HI> erect, and at right Angles with the Plain
of the Horizon, it would not. But I conceive both these Arguments are <HI>gra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
dicta,</HI> as are all the Conclusions deduced therefrom, and the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> they ex∣hibit
are to be ascribed to quite different Causes to those he a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>igns. For, first, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
to Whirl-winds and <HI>Vortices,</HI> 'tis clear, that by the violent <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of
the Air or Water, the Endeavour of those Bodies is to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cede from the Center
of that Rotation, and by that means there is less Resistance in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for
Bodies, whether heavy or light (for both will move towards it) to ge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into it;
but the lighter much easier than those that are heavy, as 'tis common to see small
Whi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les of the Wind to gather together Leaves and Straw, and light Dull,
and raise them up into the Air; but Stones and heavier Bodies are not at all

along in the plain literal Sense, as indeed most Readers have, and do as yet
conceive of it, as he, besides what he hath said in his Preface, doth more par∣ticularly
shew in his Contents of the several Sections of it, and his several Notes
dispersed here and there in said Book. But proceeding to peruse the said
Discourse, I upon the first View and Consideration of the 3 Copper Sculptures
prefixed, immediately conjectured what the Subject of the Book was likely to
be, which by divers other Circumstances afterwards I was more confirmed in,
as I shall by and by shew.</P>
<P>But first, it may seem needful that I premise some Discourse Apologetical for
my self,</P>
<P>First, for perusing a Book supposed to be a Book of Conjuration, and dealing
with the Devil and his Imps.</P>
<P>Next, For discoursing in this Place concerning a Book which has been publish∣ed
so many Years, and past under the Censure and Judgment of most Learned
Men, and so is at best but stale, and what every body knows, or may have known
already.</P>
<P>3dly, That it contains a Discourse of a Subject so much beside the Design of
the Institution of this Honourable Society; this seeming to have nothing to do
with the Improving Natural Knowledge.</P>
<P>4thly, For that it seems not to have relation to the History of Nature or of
Art, and so falls not within the Limitation of the Subject of this Lecture.</P>
<P>5thly, For my Presumption in interposing my Conjectures and Sentiments
concerning the Subject Matter of the same, after it hath been censured by such
Eminently Learned and Judicious Men, as Bp <HI>Usher,</HI> Dr. <HI>Casaubon,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>As to the first of these, I found in the very Title Dr. <HI>Merick Casaubon's</HI> Opi∣nion
specified to be, that the Relation, was real (as to the Point of Spirits) and
that a sober Christian might make several good Uses of all: And in the Preface
it self the Doctor hath very much inlarged upon this Subject, and says in the
first Page of his Preface, that he was the more confirmed in his Sentiments con∣cerning
it, when he was told at first by those that knew very well, that the most
Reverend, Pious and Learned Arch-Bishop of <HI>Armagh,</HI> then lately deceased,
upon reading the said Book before his Death, had declared himself to the same
purpose, and wished, it printed. His first Use is for an Argument against Atheists,
and such as do not believe Spirits and Devils, 2dly, Against Enthusiasts, who
altogether depend upon new Revelations, zealously and servently praying for
such Inspirations and extraordinary Assistances, saying, that this Business of
Prayer and Praising is a Business, as of great Comfort, so of much more Dan∣ger
and Delusion than many do believe; upon which account he tells many
strange Stories. 3dly, For to deter Men from presumptuous unlawful Wishes
and Desires; and thence of making use of Witches, Conjurers, Astrologers,
and Fortunetellers, and all Books of those Subjects, which he conceives were
the Cause of Dr. <HI>Dee's</HI> Delusion: So that I was satisfied there could be no great
Danger or Harm in the looking farther into the Contents of it. But more than
this, I conceived it not reasonable altogether to depend upon the Opinion and
Sentiment of others concerning it, when the Book was by, to give Testimony of
it self; for that divers Books have been condemned for supposed Crimes, of
which yet, upon further Inquiry, they have been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound innocent, and to have quite
a differing Design from what they seemed at first fight to intend. Witness the
<HI>Steganographia</HI> of, the Abbo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Tritbemi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s,</HI> which was to siercely accused of Con∣jurations
by <HI>Carolus Bovillus</HI> his Contemporary, by <HI>Wierus</HI> his Follower, also
by Cardinal <HI>Bellarmine, Ant<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nists Passerinus,</HI> and by most others since, who un∣derstood
not the Art and Ingenuity of the Book; but others more judicious
and knowing have vindicated and cleared him from those Calumnies, and proved
the Art and Ingenuity of the Book, as above all other, <HI>Gustrous Selenses,</HI> or
<HI>Augustus</HI> Duke of <HI>Lunenburgh,</HI> pag. 37. <HI>Ut prosanum Vulgus ab occulte seri∣bendt

so he proceeds to shew the Reason, why he calls some of those Spirits Dukes
or Princes, others Captains, others ministring and subservient, and in short,
detects the whole Artisice of the whole Book, which had nothing of that De∣sign
for which the illiterate and unskilful Readers did generally condemn it.</P>
<P>But secondly, As to the Staleness of the Book, it having been now printed
and published about 32 Years, I answer, that as to my self, tho' I had often seen
the Book, and heard many Discourses of it, and of its Contents, yet as to my
own knowledge of it, it was perfectly new, and possibly it may be so to a great
many others, considering the Subject of the same, and the manner of the Deli∣very
thereof, which indeed seems to be (bating some Parts that relate to a
kind of History of <HI>Dee</HI>'s particular Affairs and Transactions with some Great
Men) a Rapsody of incoherent and unintelligible Whimfies of Prayers and
Praises, Invocations and Apparitions of Spirits, strange Characters, uncouth
and unintelligible Names, Words and Sentences, and Relations of incredible
Occurrences. So that wherever you open and begin to read, you may find cause
enough in a very little time to throw it aside and neglect it, till you have
quite forgotten what you then met with, as it happen'd to me, who had in that
manner several times seen and read here and there a few Paragraphs.</P>
<P>But next I answer, that there are many Books that have been a long time
printed; nay some so long, that they are many of them almost quite lost, and
very hardly and rarely to be met with, which yet deserve to be looked into,
and an account given of, as much as many new Books, which now almost every
Day are brought forth into the World, upon which Subject I need not inlarge,
because I believe I may have many others of the same Opinion: For there are
many things which are now produced foe Novelties and new Discoveries, which
yet may be found to have been long since published, and either have not been
taken notice of, or through Length of time have been forgotten and lost, as if
they bad never been. Again, there are many Books, that have slipt into the
World at such times, as no body, or very few, at least, have taken notice of
them upon their first coming, by reason they were of Subjects then not much
regarded, or in vogue, or when Mens Minds were taken up or more concerned
for other Subjects, or Matters of greater import, which by the Time of the
Printing might possibly be the Fate of this very Book, which probably at ano∣ther
time would have made more Noise, and, it may be, have met with more
Notice, if not also more Opposition. And it has been the Fate of many good
Books to be neglected for some time after their first Publication, which yet in
time come to be better look'd into, and the Usefulness of them understood,
and then to begin to be prized, as I understand was the Fate of Mr. <HI>Purchas</HI> his
Pilgrims and Pilgrimage, and several others.</P>
<P>As to the 3d Objection that may seem to need an Apology, namely, the <HI>He∣te<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogenity</HI>
and Unfitness of the Subject for the Consideration of this Society, as
being reputed a Treatise about Supernatural Effects or Productions, I must con∣fess,
that if it be to be understood according to the plain literal Meaning, it
would be truly so; but whereas I conceive the true Meaning and Design of the
who<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to be quite another Matter, I think it may be as properly referred to the
Improvement of Natural Knowledge to understand it, as of any other Book that
has plainly and expresly treated of the History of Nature and Art. For I take
it to be a concealed History of that kind, which may also apologize for my
treating of it upon this occasion in this Lecture.</P>
<P>It may also serve for my 5th Apology: For tho' I confess it may seem to fa∣vour
of too much Confidence, to differ from the Sentiments of most Men con∣cerning
it; yet since what I propound is not positive, but rather as Queries to
<PB N="206" REF="243"/>
be resolved by such as have better Abilities and Opportunities to solve them
than I have, and that I am ready to submit to such well-grounded Determina∣utions.
I hope my Attempt in this kind will not appear to exceed the Limits of
the Charter of <HI>Philosophia libera,</HI> nor be repugnant to the Doctrine of <HI>Nullius
in Verba:</HI> For whatever may seem rational to others to judge of the said Book,
to me, I confess, it seems to be designed to comprehend another Meaning than
what is plainly legible in the Words of it, which possibly many others that
have read it, may have no Suspicion of; neither may they have ever seen or
considered the Cryptography of <HI>Trithemius,</HI> or any other Author on the like
Subjects. <HI>Non omnia possumus omnes.</HI> Thus much by way of Apology.</P>
<P>To come then to the Book it self. Upon turning it over, and comparing se∣veral
Particulars in it one with another, and with other Writings of the said
Dr. <HI>Dee,</HI> and considering also the History of the Life, Actions and Estate of the
said Author, so far as I can be informed, I do conceive that the greatest part of
the said Books especially all that which relates to the Spirits and Apparitions,
together with their Names, Speeches, Shews, Noises, Clothing, Actions, and
the Prayers and Doxologies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are all <HI>Cryptography;</HI> and that some Parts
also of that which seems to be a Journal of his Voyage and Travels into several
Parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> are also <HI>Cryptographical;</HI> that is, that under those feigned
Stories, which he there seems to relate as Matters of Fact, he hath concealed
Relations of quite another thing; and that he made use of this way of absconding
it, that he might the more securely escape discovery, if he should fall under suspi∣tion
as to the true Designs of his Travels, or that the same should fall into the
hands of any Spies, or such as might be imployed to betray him or his Intentions;
conceiving the Inquisition that should be made, or Prosecution, if discovered,
would be more gentle for a Pretended Enthusiast, than for a real Spy.</P>
<P>What his Designs or Business with the Emperor, the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and
others, was, is hard to determine, <HI>i. e.</HI> first whether he were sent upon some
private Message by the Queen, or any of the then Ministers of State, to inquire
into and discover the secret Designs or Actions of that Court, is hard now to
determine; but 'tis likely. For in his Apology he alledges, that the Lord Trea∣surer
had by the Queen's Order written to the Arch Bishop, to signify that he
went beyond Sea by her good Favour and License; and we find also that the
Queen did send several Letters and Messengers to call him home, and that upon
his Return the Queen received him kindly at <HI>Richmond,</HI> and that she used to
call at his House at <HI>Mortlack,</HI> and shewed herself courteous to him upon all
occasions, and against <HI>Christmas</HI> 1590, sent him 200 Angels to keep his <HI>Christ∣mas,</HI>
and 100 Mark for the same purpose <HI>1592.</HI> We find also, that in his Re∣turn
for <HI>England,</HI> he presented the Landgrave of <HI>Hesse</HI> with 12 <HI>Hungarian</HI> Hor∣ses;
which seems too much for any Man in a private Capacity. And when he
returned, he left <HI>Kelly</HI> with the Emperor, who for several Years after kept Cor∣respondence
with Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> here, which might possibly continue to execute the
same Design; <HI>Kelly</HI> being now grown Sir <HI>Edward Kelly,</HI> and the Emperor's Chy∣mist.
And in probability Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> might have sufficiently furnished him with
<HI>Cryptography</HI> enough to send what Intelligences he pleased, without suspition,
which was easily conceived under any other feigned Story. I will not deter∣mine
whether this were his Business, I say, or whether it might not be upon his
own account, to see if he could make a Fortune under the Emperor by means of
Chymistry, or Mathematicks, or Astrology, or Mechanicks, all which I find
by his Writings he was well versed in, and especially in the Business of Opticks,
and Perspective and Mechanick Contrivances; an effect of which I conceive his
Chrystal, or Angelical Stone, or <HI>Chrystallum Sacratum,</HI> as he terms it, to have
been, for that it was of a considerable bigness, and was placed upon a Pedestal,
or Table, which he calls a Holy Table, which might contain the <HI>Apparatus</HI> to
make Apparitions, when he had a mind to be seen in it, as likewise to produce
Noises and Voices, if there were occasion. All which might be done by Art,
as has been shewn, both formerly by <HI>Roger Bacon,</HI> and of late by the Echoing
Head. He likewise pretended to the Philosophers Stone and <HI>Elixir,</HI> for which
I take <HI>Kelly</HI> to be his Engine. I find also, that he affirms to have had 2 Ounces
of the <HI>Pouder of Projection,</HI> which, as Mr. <HI>Ashmole,</HI> in his Notes upon the
<HI>Theatrum Chymicum,</HI> published by him 1652, says, was so rich in Virtue (being
<PB N="207" REF="244"/>
One upon 272330) that they at first lost much by making Projections for
Trials, before they founds out the true height of the Medicine. He was like∣wise
well versed in <HI>Cabalistical</HI> Learning and <HI>Cryptography,</HI> as appears by the
Title of a Treatise written by him upon that Subject, and by that Book which
he seems to have prized so much, and calls the Book of <HI>Enoch,</HI> which I take
to be of no other use, than for <HI>Cryptography</HI> and <HI>Cabalisms.</HI> I will not deter∣mine,
I say, whether his Design might not be by these and some other such In∣genuities
(as particularly a Glass, which he mentions, <HI>Pag.</HI> 256. (the Secret of
which he opened to Dr. <HI>Curtz</HI> the Emperor's Physician) for <HI>Battering</HI> in a dark
Night, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which what he means by it I understand not; but Dr. <HI>Curtz</HI> told
him that Conclusion would be very acceptable to the Emperor. He had also
written Six Books <HI>deSpeculis Comburentibus,</HI> Two Books of the <HI>Astronomical Ring;</HI>
or <HI>Ring Dial,</HI> and two Books also of <HI>Clockwork</HI>) to find Entertainment and Encou∣ragement
from the Emperor. But I do rather conjecture, that he was employed by
Queen for some private Affair of State, and that he made use of these his In∣ventions,
in order to obtain the freer and more unsuspected Access to the Empe∣ror;
which having not succeeded as might have been expected, he was recalled,
and returned into <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Nov.</HI> 1589. That a great part of this Treatise is <HI>Cryp∣tography,</HI>
I conceive is very probable from these and divers other Considerations:
First, for that he took such care to preserve the Book of <HI>Enoch,</HI> which I con∣jecture
to contain the Methods and Keys of what was concealed in this Book.
Next, for that the Method and Manner thereof is so like to that of <HI>Trithemius</HI>
his <HI>Cryptography,</HI> that I conceive (were it worth while) it would not be difficult
to decipher a great part of it, by analogy thereunto. Now tho' at that time
the Key or Method of that Book were not so well and commonly known, yet
I do not doubt but this inquisitive Man had got Knowledge of it in his Travels
and Enquiries in <HI>Germany,</HI> possibly when he presented his <HI>Monas Hieroglyphica</HI>
to the Emperor <HI>Maximilian</HI> 1564; and possibly it might be upon the same ac∣count,
that he made choice of this way of Invocations and Revelations to con∣ceal
his Meaning, that I shewed before <HI>Trithemius</HI> had done in his. <HI>Trithemius</HI>
also pretended to Revelation, as may be seen in the History of his Life, tho'
not so frequent as this Author has done in this Book, at least if the Sense thereof
be understood literally; but that I conceive to be nothing but the outward Form,
Appearance or Dress of the Substance and Subject of the Book, which lay abscon∣ded
from common Discovery under that Mask or Disguise; tho' yet I am apt to
believe he had some artificial Contrivances to perform this also, when he saw cause.
Thirdly, for that there are very many plain Instances of <HI>Cryptography,</HI> both by
changing and putting some Letters for others, and Numbers for Letters, and Num∣bers
also for Words, and Tables for disposing or placing Letters according to se∣veral
Orders and Methods, to be seen in the Book it self: And the Book which
he calls the Book of <HI>Enoch,</HI> seems to be nothing else. Besides, the Words that
he sets down, as delivered by his Spirits, are many of them inarticulate, accord∣ing
to the commonly accepted Sounds or Pronunciation of those Characters they
are written with, and therefore were not put to signify those Letters. It would
be too long to give Instances out of the Book it self of these Particulars, and
'tis needless, since they, are so very many and frequent in every part of the Book.
He hath likewise divers Polygonal Figures, as I conceive, for the same purpose,
and many other such indications of <HI>Cryptography.</HI></P>
<P>And to conclude for the present, any one that does without prejudice peruse
the <HI>Libri Mystici Apertorii Cracoviensis Sabbatici,</HI> pag. 115. will see a hundred
Arguments to convince him of the Probability, if not Certainty of this my Con∣jecture:
And some other time I shall give: some other Arguments, which may
possibly give fuller Satisfaction. But I would not detain too long upon this Subject.</P>

Virtutibus; Monas Hieroglyphica; Speculum Unitatis</HI> (being an Apology for
our famous Friar <HI>Bacon</HI>); his <HI>Cabbalae Hebraicae Compendiosa Tabula,</HI> with many
others, afford no small Evidence to the World.</P>
<P>All which, and many more in several kinds of Learning, as History, Heral∣dry,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> written by him before the Year 1583. Some time he bestowed in Vul∣gar
<HI>Chymistry,</HI> and was therein Master of divers Secrets; amongst others he
(<HI>Dec.</HI> 28. 1519.) revealed to one <HI>Roger Cook,</HI> the great Secret of the <HI>Elixir</HI> (as
he called it) of the Salt of Metals, the Projection whereof was one upon a
hundred. His great Ability in <HI>Astrology,</HI> and the more secret Parts of Learning
(to which he had a strong Propensity and unwearied Phansy) drew from the En∣vious
and Vulgar, many rash, hard, and lying Scandals upon his most honest
and justifiable Philosophical Studies, and many times forced him, out of the
Bitterness of his Soul (which was even crucified with the Malice of impudent
Tongues) most seriously and servently to apologize: Nor could he enjoy Tran∣quality
in his Studies, but was oft disquieted and vexed with the sower Dispo∣litions
of such as scandalized most injuriously both him and them: Insomuch
that (1581) the Year he went beyond Sea, his Library was seized on, wherein
were 4000 Books, 700 of them Manuscripts. (<HI>A Caveat for all Ingenious and
Eminent Philosophers to be more wise than to keep any dear or excellent Books in
their own Houses.</HI>) And 'tis most probable that at this time his <HI>Speculum Unita∣tis</HI>
might fall into some Hands that would never since suffer it to see Light;
which might occasion the Learned <HI>Selden</HI> to say [in the Preface to <HI>Hopton's Con∣cordance</HI>]
this Apology was long since promised by him, but intimating it was
never writ. <HI>Anno</HI> 1592, [<HI>Novemb.</HI> 9.] Mr. Secretary <HI>Walsingham,</HI> and Sir <HI>Tho.
George,</HI> were sent to his then Dwelling house at <HI>Mortlack</HI> (by virtue of a Com∣mission)
to understand the Matter and Causes for which his Studies were scan∣dalized;
and for some things in the like nature, was he necessitated to send his
Apologetical Letter to the Arch Bishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P>These kind of Persections were still multiplied upon him, and he sometimes
personally aggrieved by them: For about the Year 1594, he was under some
Restraint, which occasioned him to write to the Lady <HI>Scudamore</HI> [<HI>Oct.</HI> 28. 1594.]
to move the Queen, that either he might declare his Case to the Body of the
Council, or else under the Broad Seal have Liberty to go freely where he pleased.</P>
<P>—'Tis generally reported, that Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> and Sir <HI>Edward Kelly</HI> were so
strangely fortunate, as to find a very large Quantity of the <HI>Elixir</HI> in some Parts
of the Ruins of <HI>Glastenbury</HI> Abby, which was so incredibly rich in Virtue (be∣ing
one upon 272330) that they lost much in making Projection by way of
Trials, before they found out the true height of the Medicine. And no sooner
<PB N="201" REF="246"/>
were they Masters of this Treasure, then they resolved to travel into foreign
Parts, when falling into acquaintance with one <HI>Albertus Lasky,</HI> a <HI>Polonian</HI>
Prince, which came into <HI>England</HI> in the beginning of <HI>May</HI> 1583, on the 21st of
<HI>September</HI> following, they, their Wives, Children and Families, went beyond
Sea with the said Prince. And whether they found it at <HI>Glastenbury,</HI> as is afore∣said,
or however else they came by it, 'tis certain they had it: For at <HI>Trebona</HI>
in <HI>Bohemia,</HI> whither they were come to dwell [<HI>Sept.</HI> 4. 1586.] Sir <HI>Edward Kelly</HI>
made Projection with one small Grain thereof [<HI>Dec.</HI> 9. 1586.] in proportion
no bigger than the least Grain of Sand, upon one Ounce and a quarter of com∣mon
<HI>Mercury,</HI> and it produced almost an Ounce of most pure Gold. This was
done to gratify Mr. <HI>Edward Garland</HI> and his Brother <HI>Francis,</HI> and in their Pre∣sence;
which <HI>Edward</HI> was lately come to <HI>Trebona,</HI> being sent thither to Dr. <HI>Dee</HI>

it from a credible Person, that one <HI>Broomfield</HI> and <HI>Alexander Roberts</HI> told him,
they had often seen Sir <HI>Edward Kelly</HI> make Projection, and in particular upon a
Piece of Metal cut out of a Warming-pan, and without Sir <HI>Edward's</HI> touching
or handling it, or melting the Metal, only warming it in the Fire, the <HI>Elixir</HI> be∣ing
put thereon, it was transmuted into pure Silver. The Warming pan, and
this Piece of it, was sent to Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> by her Ambassador, who then lay
at <HI>Prague,</HI> that by fitting the Piece into the Place from whence it was cut out, it
might exactly appear to be once part of that Warming pan. The aforesaid Person
hath likewise seen in the hands of one Mr. <HI>Frye</HI> and <HI>Scroop,</HI> Rings of Sir <HI>Edward
Kelly</HI>'s Gold, the Fashion of which was only Gold Wire twisted thrice about the
Finger; and of these fashioned Rings he gave away to the value of 4000 <HI>l.</HI> at
the Marriage of one of his Servant-Maids. This was highly generous; but to
say truth, he was openly, profuse beyond the modest Limits of a sober Philosopher.</P>
<P>During their abode at <HI>Trebona</HI> they try'd many Chymical Experiments, to see
whether they could make that Jewel they possest; (The particular Account of
their Operations I need not here relate.) yet I cannot hear that ever they ac∣complisht
any thing: Only I find the 27th of <HI>April</HI> noted by Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> with se∣veral
Expressions of Joy and Gladness, as, <HI>Haec est Dies quam secit Dominus:</HI>
Again, <HI>Misericordia Dei Magna;</HI> and lastly, <HI>Omne, quod vivit, laudet Dominum.</HI>
And to testify what they meant, he writes upon the 30th Day following, <HI>Mr.</HI> Ed∣ward
Kelly <HI>did open the Great Secret to me, God be thanked.</HI> While they lived
at <HI>Trebona,</HI> Sir <HI>Edward Kelly</HI> went divers times to <HI>Prague,</HI> and the 15th of <HI>Jan.</HI>
1587, he went into <HI>Poland,</HI> but returned the 9th of <HI>February</HI> after. And 'tis
probable these Journies were made in quest after some famous Chymists. Things
were not carried here so privately, but Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> had notice given her of
their Actions; whereupon she used several means by Letters and Messages to in∣vite
them back into <HI>England,</HI> where it was believed she had so far prevailed, that
Mr. <HI>Symkinson</HI> and Mr. <HI>Francis Garland</HI>'s Brother <HI>Robert</HI> coming from <HI>England</HI> to
<HI>Trebona</HI> [<HI>Dec.</HI> 8. 1587.] supposed they had been ready to come over to <HI>England</HI>
upon the Queen's Letters formerly sent them. And tho' Sir <HI>Edward Kelly</HI> staid
behind, yet Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> left <HI>Trebona</HI> [<HI>May</HI> 1. 1589.] and came for <HI>England.</HI> But
whether occasioned by some Unkindness received from Sir <HI>Edw. Kelly,</HI> or falling
out of their Wives, or Sollicitation of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> or all of these concur∣ring,
I am not yet certain. Not unlike but each of these might contribute to
their Separation. For that there was some great and wonderful Unkindness past
from Sir <HI>Edward Kelly,</HI> appears by his sending for Dr. <HI>Dee,</HI> the beginning of
<HI>Jan.</HI> 1588, under shew of Reconciliation, and discovering more than ordinary In∣timacy
and Complacency about that time; which fair Shews the Good Doctor
notes with these Prayers, <HI>God lead his Heart to all Charity and Brotherly Love.</HI>
As also Letters sent by Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> to Sir <HI>Edward Kelly</HI> and his Wife the end of <HI>March</HI>
following, requiring at their hands mutual Charity; which [<HI>May</HI> 9.] after, upon
Mrs. <HI>Kelly</HI>'s receiving the Sacrament, she gave her Hand to Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> and his Wife
in token of Charity. But it seems things were not cordial, but only outward: For
the 6th of <HI>September</HI> following, the Lord Chancellor coming to <HI>Trebona,</HI> the Ran∣cour
and Dissimulation was more evident to him, and it seems grew up to a great∣er
height than he could bear. And thereupon he thought wisely to avoid the
<PB N="209" REF="247"/>
further Danger by leaving <HI>Germany,</HI> which occasioned him [<HI>Jan.</HI> 4. 1589.] to
deliver to Sir <HI>Edward Kelly</HI> the Powder, the Books, the Glass, with some other
things, and thereupon received his Discharge in Writing under his Hand and Seal.
While these Discontents continued, several Letters past between Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>
and Dr. <HI>Dee,</HI> whereby perhaps he might promise to return. At length it so fell
out, that he [<HI>March</HI> 1. 1589.] left <HI>Trebona,</HI> and took his Journy for <HI>England.</HI>
The 9th of <HI>April</HI> he came to <HI>Breame,</HI> and had not staid there 3 Days, but the
Landgrave of <HI>Hesse</HI> sent Letters of civil Complements to him, and within 3 Days
after Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> presented him with his 12 <HI>Hungarian</HI> Horses, that he bought at <HI>Pra∣gue</HI>
for his Journy. Here (<HI>June</HI> 27. 1589.) the Famous <HI>Hermetick</HI> Philosopher,
Dr. <HI>Henric Kunrath</HI> of <HI>Hamburgh</HI> came to visit him. The 16th of <HI>Novemb.</HI> he
went thence to <HI>Stade,</HI> where he met with Mr. <HI>Edward Dyer</HI> going Embassador for
<HI>Denmark,</HI> who the Year before had been at <HI>Trebona,</HI> and carried back Letters
from the Doctor to Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> He was a great Correspondent of Dr. <HI>Dee</HI>'s,
and as earnest a Searcher after the Stone. The 23d of <HI>Nov.</HI> following he arriv'd
at <HI>Gravesend,</HI> having been out of <HI>England</HI> 6 Years, 2 Months, and 2 Days; and
the 9th of <HI>Dec.</HI> presented himself to the Queen at <HI>Richmond,</HI> where he was fa∣voured
with a kind Reception.</P>
<P>Being settled again at <HI>Mortlack,</HI> the Queen used to call at his House to visit
him, and shewed her self very courteous to him upon all occasions. Against
<HI>Christmas</HI> 1590, she sent him 200 Angels wherewith to keep his <HI>Christmas,</HI> and
100 Marks against <HI>Christmas</HI> 1592. She likewise sent him word by Mr. <HI>Thomas
Candish,</HI> to do what he would in Alchymy and Philosophy, and none should con∣troul
or molest him: And not unlike, by the Queen's Example, divers Persona∣ges
of Honour at Court frequented his Company, and sent him many Gifts from
time to time; amongst others Sir <HI>Tho. Jones</HI> most nobly offer'd him his Castle of
<HI>Emlin</HI> in <HI>Wales</HI> to dwell in free with all Accommodations.</P>
<P>His Favour was fair at Court, the Queen her self bad him find out something
for her to bestow; yet all the Preferment he gained was (<HI>Dec.</HI> 8. 1594.) the
Grant of the <HI>Chancellorship</HI> of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s; and the 27th of <HI>May</HI> 1595, his Patent
past the Great Seal for the <HI>Wardenship</HI> of <HI>Manchester,</HI> whither he, his Wife,
Children and Family came the 14th of <HI>Feb.</HI> 1596. and the 20th Day following
was installed, and in this Wardenship, (wherein he had the Unhappiness to be
often vext with the turbulent Fellows of that College) died, deserving the Com∣mendation
of all Learned and Ingenious Scholars, and to be remembred for his
remarkable Abilities.</P>
<P>After Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> came to <HI>England,</HI> as is before remembred, Correspondence was
still maintained between him and Sir <HI>Edward Kelly,</HI> in Letters sent by Mr. <HI>Fran∣cis
Garland</HI> and others (and some Expectancy of Sir <HI>Edward</HI>'s, coming over
(<HI>Dec.</HI> 23. 1589.) Mr. <HI>Thomas Kelly</HI> his Brother putting the Doctor in hopes there∣of
likewise.) But at length Sir <HI>Edward</HI> was clapt up close Prisoner by the Em∣peror
(for he had so unwarily and openly managed the Secret, that it had given
the Emperor occasion to carry a strict eye over all his Actions, out of a desire to
be Sharer with him in his good Fortune) yet it seems the Emperor set him at
Liberty (<HI>Nov.</HI> 4. 1593.) and Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> had notice of it the 5th of <HI>December</HI> after.
And tho' he began to grow into the Emperor's Favour, in hopes to be entertained
into his Service (for so he certify'd Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> by Letters in <HI>August</HI> 1595.) never∣theless
he was clapt up again into Prison, and attempting to make his Escape out
of a high Window, by the tearing of his Sheets, which were ty'd together to
let him down, he being a weighty Man, fell and broke his Leg, and thereof
died. This is one Report of his Death. Others there are, but Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> men∣tions
none at all, of the manner thereof, only this: <HI>Nov.</HI> 25. 1595. <HI>News that
Sir</HI> E. K. <HI>was stain.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A Discourse of Earthquakes.</HEAD>
<P>I Have formerly endeavour'd to explain several Observations I had made
concerning the Figure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Introducti∣on to the fol∣lowing Dis∣course, giving some account of its Design.</NOTE>
Form, Position, Distance, Order, Motions
and Operations of the Celestial Bodies, both as to themselves, and one
with another, and likewise with respect to the Body of the <HI>Earth</HI> on which
we inhabit. But conceiving it may more nearly concern us to know more
particularly the Constitution; Figure, Magnitude and Properties of the Bo∣dy
of the <HI>Earth</HI> itself, and of its several constituent Parts, I have endea∣vour'd
to collect such Observations and Natural Histories of others, as may
serve to give some Light toward the making a compleat Discovery of them,
so far as the Power, Faculties, Organs, and other helps that Nature has
furnish'd Man with<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may assist us in performing and perfecting thereof.</P>
<P>The Subject is large, as extending as far as the whole Bulk included within
the utmost limits of the Atmosphere: And 'tis not less copious and repleat with
variety, as containing all the several Parts and Substances included within
those Limits, namely, The aerial, watery and earthy Parts thereof, whether
Superficial or Subterraneous, whether Exposed or Absconded, whether Supra∣terraneal,
Superterraneal, or Subterraneal, whether Elemental or Organical,
Animate or Inanimate, and all the Species and Kinds of them, and all the con∣stituent
Parts of them, and the Composits constituted of them; of which al∣so
there will fall under Consideration, the Artificial as well as the Natural
Causes and Powers effective of things; then their Generation, Production,
Augmentation, Perfection, Vertue, Power, Activity, Operation, Effect,
Conservation, Duration, Declination, Destruction, Corruption, Transfor∣mation,
and in one word, the motion or progression of Nature sensibly ex∣prest,
or any other ways discernable in each of those Species. Which Sub∣ject,
if we consider as it is thus represented, doth look very like an Im∣possibility
to be undertaken even by the whole World, to be gone through
within an Age, much less to be undertaken by any particular Society,
or a small number of Men. The number of Natural Histories, Observati,
ons, Experiments, Calculations, Comparisons, Deductions and Demonstra∣tions
necessary thereunto, seeming to be incomprehensive and numberless:
And therefore a vain Attempt, and not to be thought of till after some
Ages past in making Collections of Materials for so great a Building, and
the employing a vast number of Hands in making this Preparation; and
those of several sorts, such as Readers of History, Criticks, Rangers and
Namesetters of Things, Observers and Watchers of several Appearances, and
Progressions of Natural Operations and Perfections, Collectors of curious
Productions, Experimenters and Examiners of Things by several Means and
several Methods and Instruments, as by Fire, by Frost, by Menstruums,
by Mixtures, by Digestions, Putrefactions, Fermentations and Petrifactions,
by Grindings, Brusings, Weighings and Measuring, Pressing and Conden∣sing,
Dilating and Expanding, Dissecting, Separating and Dividing, Sifting
And Streining; by viewing with Glasses and Microscopes, Smelling, Tast∣ing,
Feeling, and various other ways of Torturing and Wracking of
Natural Bodies, to find out the Truth or the real Effect as it is in its Con∣stitution
or State of Being.</P>
<P>To these may be added Registers or Compilers, such as shall Record and Ex∣press
in proper Terms these Collections; add to these Examiners and Rangers
of Things, such as shall distinguish and marshal them into proper Classes,
and denote their Excellencies or Gradations of differing Kinds, their Per∣fections
or Defects, what are Compleat, and what Defective, and to be re∣peated,
and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="251"/>
So that we see the Subject of this Enquiry is very copious and large, and
will afford Work enough for every Well-willer to employ his Head and Hands,
to contribute towards the providing Materials for so large a Fabrick and
Structure, as the great quantity of Materials to be collected do seem to de∣note.
However, 'tis possible that a much less number may serve the turn,
if fitly qualified and done with Method and Design, and it may be much better
and easier.</P>
<P>When this mighty Collection is made, what will be the use of so great a
Pile? Where will be found the Architect that shall contrive and raise the
Superstructure that is to be made of them, that shall fit every one for its pro∣per
use? Till which be found, they will indeed be but a heap of Confusion.
Who shall find out the Experiments, the Observations, and other Remarks,
fit for this or that Theory? One Stone is too thick, or too thin, too broad,
or too narrow, not of a due colour, or hardness, or grain, to suit with the
Design, or with some other that are duly scapled for the purpose: This Piece
of Timber is not of a right Kind, not of a sufficient Driness and Seasoning,
not of a due length and bigness, but wants its Scantlings, or is of an ill
Shape for such a purpose, or was not fell'd in a due time: 'Tis Sap-rotten,
or Wind-shaken, or rotten at Heart, or too frow, and the like, for the pur∣pose
for which 'tis wanted.</P>
<P>I mention this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Use of pre∣design'd Theo∣ries, and Mo∣dules of En∣quiry.</NOTE> to hint only by the by, that there may be use, of Method
in the collecting of Materials, as well as in the use of them, and to shew
that there may be made a Provision too great, as well as too little, that
there ought to be some End and Aim, some pre-design'd Module and The∣ory,
some Purpose in our Experiments, and more particular observing of
such Circumstances as are proper for that Design. And though this Ho∣nourable
Society have hitherto seem'd to avoid and prohibit pre-conceived
Theories and Deductions from particular, and seemingly accidental Experi∣ments;
yet I humbly conceive, that such, if knowingly, and judiciously made,
are Matters of the greatest Importance, as giving a Characteristick of the
Aim, Use, and Significancy thereof; and without which, many, and possi∣bly
the most considerable Particulars, are passed over without Regard and
Observation. The most part of Mankind are taken with the Prettiness or
the Strangeness of the Phaenomena, and generally neglect the common and
the most obvious; whereas in truth, for the most part, they are the most
considerable. And the greatest part of the Productions of Nature are to be
seen every where, and by every one, though, for the most part, not heeded
or regarded, because they are so common. I could wish therefore that the
Information of Experiments might be more respected, than either the No∣velty,
the Surprizingness, the Pomp, and Appearances of them.</P>
<P>The obviousness and easiness of knowing many Things in Nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">of figured Stones.</NOTE> has
been the Cause of their being neglected, even by the more diligent and cu∣rious;
which nevertheless, if well examined, do very often contain Informa∣tions
of the greatest value. It has been generally noted by common, as well
as inquisitive, Persons, that divers Stones have been found, formed into the
Shapes of Fishes, Shells, Fruits, Leaves, Wood, Barks, and other Vegeta∣ble
and Animal Substances: We commonly know some of them exactly re∣sembling
the Shape of Things we commonly find (as the Chymists speak) in
the Vegetable or Animal Kingdom; others of them indeed bearing some
kind of Similitude, and agreeing in many Circumstances, but yet not exactly
figured like any other thing in Nature; and yet of so curious a Shape, that
they easily raise both the Attention and Wonder, even of those that are less
inquisitive. Of these beautifully shaped Bodies I have observed two sorts:
First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">of Chrystals, and the like Stones, shot into Figures.</NOTE> some more properly natural, such as have their Figures peculiar to
their Substances: Others more improperly so, that is, such as seem to receive
their Shape from an external and accidental Mould.</P>
<P>Of the first sort, are all those curiously figured Bodies of Salts, Talks,
Spars, Crystals, Diamonds, Rubies, Amethysts, Ores, and divers other Mi∣neral
Substances, wherewith the World is adorned and enriched; which
I
at present omit to describe, as reserving them for a Second Part, they seem∣ing
to be, as it were, the Elemental Figures, or the <HI>ABC</HI> of Nature's
<PB N="281" REF="252"/>
working, the Reason of whose curious Geometrical Forms (as I may so call
them) is very easily explicable Mechanically: And shall proceed to the second
sort of Bodies.</P>
<P>Of these are two kinds;<NOTE PLACE="marg">of Petrisa∣ctions.</NOTE> either first the very Substances themselves conver∣ted
into Stone, such are Bones, Teeth, Shells, Fruit, Wood, Moss, Mush∣rooms,
and divers Vegetable and Animal Substances: Or secondly, such o∣ther
Mineral or Earthy Substances, as Clays, Sands, Earths, Flinty Jui∣ces,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> which have filled up, and been moulded in divers other Bodies, as
Shells, Bones, Fruits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but especially Shells. These, according to the
Representations they bear of other Bodies, have received divers Names; of
which <HI>Aldrovandus, Bauhinus, Imperatus, Wormius,</HI> and others, reckon a great
number: Such are, <HI>Cornu ammonis sine armatura, Helicoides, Hoplites,
multiplex obscure lucens, muricatum, cristatum, cristatum pertusum, striatum Cam∣poides,
Campoides Echinatum, Caprinum cornu, Cornu Arietinum, Sceleton Ser∣pentis.
Conchites bivalvis striatus, Mytulus bisoris, cinerius rugosus, Coclites,
Chama lapidea, laevis, rugata, Ostracites, Pectenites, Bucardia, Strombites, Be∣lemnitae
Cornu fossile, Glossopetrae, Astroites, Entrochos, Colonetta, Lapis judaicus,
Fungites, fungus saxeus, Lapis Indicus, Brontias, Brontias favogineus, Ombria,
Ovum anguinum, Lignum petrifactum.</HI> Of these I shall describe some few, be∣cause
every one has not the Opportunity of seeing and examining them.</P>
<P><HI>AS to the figured Stones or Petrifactions here mention'd, I found only one Sheet
of the Descriptions of several of the</HI> Cornu-Ammonis <HI>sort, with some of the</HI>
Echini, <HI>or Helmet-stones, which Descriptions follow: As for the Designs of them,
they were, I know not by what means, not to be found amongst his Manuscripts; but
by the Favour of Dr.</HI> Sloane, <HI>into whose Hands they happily fell, I procured them
for the Graver, to whom the World and my self are obliged for this, as well as for
other more valuable Communications. The Five first Tables were design'd by
Dr.</HI> Hook himself; <HI>and tho' he has not perfected the Descriptions of them all, yet
I have procured them all to be graved, supplying in some measure my self those Fi∣gures
which were left undescribed by him. The Two last I drew my self from some
figured Stones I happen'd to meet with, not far from</HI> Bristol, <HI>some Years since; a∣bout
which time I gave the Designs to Dr.</HI> Hook, <HI>together with a Particular Ex∣plication
of the Figures, but by Missortune did not keep an exact Copy of what I
then gave him, which, amongst others of his Papers, is lost. I have endeavoured to
supply this, as well as I now can, as the Reader may see by a
short Account of a
Letter I then sent him, with these Draughts; which I have so far presumed upon
the Readers Acceptance, as to insert after the Explications of the Author's own
Draughts.</HI></P>

<P>I have designed 15 several sorts of Snail rather than Snake-stones, call'd
by some Authors <HI>Cornua Ammonis,</HI> or <HI>Sceleta Serpentum,</HI> all of them, both of
different Substances and various Shapes; but yet all of them agreeing in
these Proprieties, that they were made of a Tapering or Pyramidal Body,
coil'd up together, so as that the Tip or Point of it was in the Center, and
the Base outmost; next that, in the coiling up, the Axis of this Pyramidal
Body kept exactly in the same Plane. 3. That all of them were ridged
or furrow'd with Rings, Furrows, or Proturberances and Depressions, which
respected the Center of the Spiral, for the most part, but were moulded and
rang'd each of them different ways, all of them very regular, and exceeding∣ly
ornamental. 4. That in the coiling the lesser and inner Parts sunk, as it
were, always into the inside of the greater encompassing Part. 5. That all
of them had Diaphragms, or separating Valves, whereby the Parts might
oft-times be easily separated. 6. That the <HI>Fimbriae,</HI> or Edges of these Dia∣phragms,
were in most of these Stones very visible; in others of them,
where they were somewhat more obscure, they might be made apparent, by
scraping or rubbing away the outsides of them. 7. That these <HI>Fimbriae</HI> or Ed∣ges
appear'd on the Surface, like the Out-lines of some curious Foliage, a
Specimen of some of which I have given in the 3d and 10th Figures. This,
<PB N="282" REF="253"/>
upon Examination of them, I found to proceed from the Fulness of the Edges
of the Diaphragms whereby the Edges were waved or plaited somewhat in
the manner of a Ruff. 8. That most of them were covered with a very cu∣riously
polish'd, as well as curiously carv'd Surface, some of them shining like
burnish'd Brass, as those of the 1st and 2d Figures; others like Brass, tar∣nish'd
Black, but rubb'd smooth; others of them like transparent Horn, as
the 12th Figure; others like Coperas-stones; others like a coarfer sort of
white Marble; others like black Marble. 9. That from these polisht Surfaces
one might oftimes easily pick off a Substance exactly resembling the plaited
shining Substances of a Shell. and this did very visibly in many of them co∣ver
the internal stony Body, with a Coat two or three times as thick as a
Snail's Shell, 10. That the biggest end of these Spiral Bodies was always
imperfect without any determinate Figure. 11. That many of these Spiral Bo∣dies
seem'd, as if they had been broken and shatter'd, and had grown together
again in an irregular Posture. 12. That many of them were compounded of se∣veral
Substances, the Spaces between the Diaphragms being sometimes fill'd
with one kind of Substance, sometimes with another, and sometimes they were
found empty, only all the sides of the Diaphragm were cover'd with a kind of
Tooth-Sparr. 13. There were many of these which were at first included
in Stones, out of which they might easily be separated, so as to leave a per∣fect
Impression like themselves; but in most of those incompassing Bodies,
the Impression was bigger than the impressing Body, by the thickness of a thin
Shell, which seemed to have been heretofore the Cause of both
Impressions,
but was worn away and decay'd by the Injury of time; they differ'd one from
another chiefly in these Particulars: First, That the Bases or Planes supposed
to cut these spirall'd Bodies at right Angles, with the Circumference and
Plane thro' the Axis, were of different Figures; as that of the first Figure
was much like that of a common Nautilus, being somewhat like the Figure
of a Turkish Crescent; but the Diaphragms were not smooth and plain like
those of a Nautilus, but full and ruffled like the Leaves of Sea-wrack, and se∣veral
other luxuriant Vegetables, and that (which appear'd by the Foliage
visible on the Surface) the Diaphragms were much thicker and closer
together: This on the outside was like polish'd Silver, but the inside of a
Substance not much unlike blue Slate, but closer, harder, and heavier.
That of the 3d Figure was of a Figure, as if the former had been press'd
quite flat; so that instead of the round Back in the 2d Figure, this has a
Back terminated with a sharp Edge, as in the 4th Figure, 'tis all over almost
cover'd with a shining Substance not unlike a Substance we call Alchimy, or
whited? Brass; on this the Foliage of the Edges of the Diaphragms is very
visible, one of which I have described in its posture, as at <HI>a,</HI> and 3 others
of them, that the Curiosity of them might be the more visible, I have descri∣bed
by the help of a Lens in the 5th Figure. Somewhat like to this is that
of the 6th Figure; but that instead of an edged Back, this is hollowed or
furrowed not unlike the Wheel of a Pully, with two protuberant Ridges on
either side, as is visible in the 7th Figure; the Surface is undulated like the
former two, but somewhat more manifestly, the Fashion of which Waves are
not unlike the Ribs of wicker Screens, 2, 3, 4, and sometimes more of them
uniting at last together into one more conspicuous Rib which crosses the Cen∣ter;
the other side of this was broken so that the Diaphragms and several
hollow Cavities between them were to be seen, 'twas of a Substance some∣what
like the Rust of Iron. That of Figure the 8th was of a Substance some∣what
like <HI>Portland</HI>-stone but closer and harder. The transverse Section of
it was much like the former, as may be seen in the 9th Figure: The Back of
it was gutter'd and knobbed very like a <HI>Japan▪</HI> Nautilus, one of which I
have in Mr. <HI>Colwall's</HI> Gift: The Ribs also, or Furrows of the Side were not
much unlike, only they were somewhat finer wrought with Knobs or Buttons,
as may be perceived by the Figure. The Knobs and Surface of the 10th was
somewhat like this, but that they were a little more gross, as is visible by the
Figure; this was of the Colour of a Bone that has been long buried in the

or Edges of the Diaphragms were most conspicuous, the transverse Section
you have in the 11th Figure. The Snail-stone describ'd by the 12th Figure
was of pellucid Pebble, and look'd almost like Horn; that this had
Diaphragms also, is evident by the end of it, which is bounded by one, as
may be seen by the 13th Figure, which shews also the transverse Section of it.
It had a Spine or Quill <HI>a,</HI> coiled about the back of it, the biggest part of which
was broken off, and only the hollow part of the Quill of the Shell was left, as
at <HI>b</HI> in the 12th: But at <HI>c</HI> the Quill was intire, and the Substance that fill'd
the hollow of it, was transparent Pebble like the rest of the Stone; the in∣compassing
Shell was much worn away, only in some Parts of it 'twas visible
enough.</P>
<P>The small one in the 14th Figure was much of the same Make, the Shell
that covered it was black like the other, its End was also terminated by a
Diaphragm, as is visible in the 15th Figure, where the transverse Section
is also describ'd; but the Substance that fill'd it was quite differing, being a
kind of Pyrites or Coperas-stone. The small one of the 16th Figure was of a
Shape participating of the 1st and 3d, the transverse Section of it shewing
it to be thinner than the 1st, but thicker than the 3d, was terminated by a
Diaphragm very finely leav'd, and with viewing it very intensely, I could
perceive the Sutures very finely wrought, much like those of the 5th Figure:
It was fill'd with a black, stony Substance, and on the other Side of it (being
a little broken) several of the Cavities between the Diaphragms appear'd
empty. The little Part of one describ'd in the 18th Figure, was compound∣ed
as it were of the 8th and 14th, as may be seen by the transverse Section of
it. Fig. 19. This, as the rest, had visible Diaphragms also, 'twas of a Substance
like rusty Iron: These preceding were all of them of a Figure that taper'd
very much, so as the Spiral from a very large Circumference, was presently
contracted into a little one; but the following were of a Figure more pro∣tracted,
and made many more Revolutions before they ended. Of this kind
the 20th was the plainest, resembling that of the first of the other kind;
'twas ribb'd not much unlike it, and the transverse Section was much the
same with that of the 2d Figure, as is visible in the 21st Figure.</P>
<P>The 22d was somewhat like the 12th, but of a smaller Spiral; it was ter∣minated
with a Diaphragm, and had a small Spine or Quill which was laid
round the Back of it, as may be seen by the 23d Figure; the Shell of it was
yet sticking on it, and it look'd very like burnisht Brass; it seem'd to be a
very hard Stone. The 24th somewhat resembled the 14th, the Surface of it
may be perceiv'd by the 24th, and the transverse Section by the 25th Figure;
'twas a Pyrites, and one part of it was dissolv'd into Salt by the Air: I had
two or three others of the same shape, one of a kind of grey Marble, ano∣ther
of a Flint, a third of an iron Stone, which I have describ'd in the 26th
Figure, the Stone incompassing it, and the filling of the Shell it self being
both of the same Substance: One of these was bruised in the hardning, so
that the Cracks of the Shell were very visible; the like Accident was com∣mon
to many of the rest, and the Shell encompassing was of a distinct Sub∣stance
from the rest, and was easie to be pick'd off. But the prettiest of all
the rest was the 27th, where the several Coats of the Shell and Diaphragms
were very distinct, tho' they seem'd to be all petrify'd and turn'd to another
Substance. It had been very much broken before the hardning, and all the
Cracks of the Shell were very distinct; and which seem'd a little strange,
some Parts of it were thrust outward, as if it had been fill'd with Water; and,
by Congelation, the Ice had swell'd and broken out the sides of it, which
probably might be the Cause; for all between the Diaphragms it was fill'd
with a transparent Spar or Caulk, such as is usually dug out of Lead Mines,
a Substance between Crystal and Talk; the Original of which Substance
seems to me not unlikely to be congeal'd petrifying Water; the Valuta of it
was curiously ribb'd or moulded, and the Foliage or Edges of the Diaphragms
were very Ornamental. It had a Spine or Quill went round the back of it,
as several of the former; the transverse Section you have in the 28th
Figure.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="256"/>
The Surface of the 29th was of a peculiar kind of carving, as is visible by
the Figure; it was of a reddish Flint, the outside very smooth and polish'd, the
side not visible was not so perfect, being broken in several places, and disco∣vering
the Diaphragms, and that some of the interjacent Spaces were empty.
The greater End of this looking very irregular, I broke with a smart stroke
of a Hammer a little piece off from it, and discover'd two small Snakes-stones
within it, which probably had been tumbled into the Mouth of it before it
was concreted; for they were of the very same Substance, but of a differing
Figure from any I have yet describ'd, being ribb'd like the 24th, but only
they were bigger and farther distant, and they went quite round the back. This
last, and another like the 24th were taken up near <HI>Keinsham,</HI> about 4 or 5
Miles from <HI>Bristol,</HI> and sent by Dr. <HI>Beal,</HI> whence also I suppose several of the
other may have come.</P>
<P>Had they not been much too large, I would have describ'd also one or two
of those <HI>Cornua Ammonis,</HI> presented to the Repository by the Right Honourable
<HI>Henry Howard</HI> of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> which are in Diameter about 2 ½ Foot, and the
concave Impression of one of a greater Magnitude, which I found in a Piece
of <HI>Portland</HI>-stone. These large Stones are between 300 and 400 Weight, and
of a Stone in all Particulars much like <HI>Portland</HI>-stone, whence I suppose they
were at first fetch'd: They are all shap'd much like that of the 20th Figure;
but the coiled Cone is not altogether so round, nor so slender, or of so acute
an Angle, but the Undulations of the Surfaces are alike, and so are also the
Diaphragms. I have been also told by Persons of very good Credit, that
they have seen in <HI>Darbyshire</HI> and <HI>Yorkshire</HI> Snail-stones of a much more prodi∣gious
bigness, 3 or 4 times as big as these; which I have not had an Oppor∣tunity
to send to enquire more curiously into, though I have much desired;
and so much the rather, because it seems much more to excel in bigness all
other Shell-fishes we know, than the Giants (Stories tells us of) did exceed
the ordinary Size of Men now living.</P>
<P>I have, to parallel these Snake-stones added in Table II. a Description
of three several sorts of Nautil-shells, because I had no greater variety by
me, though I have seen many other kinds. The 1st Figure represents a large
Nautilus-shell cut <HI>per axin,</HI> and manifests the manner how the Diaphragms
are placed in that kind of Shell in the concave Part thereof; and the 2d Fi∣gure
shews how they are placed up the convex side; this being a small
Piece of the middle of a Nautilus-shell, and the wreathed Lines shew where
the Diaphragms join'd upon the back thereof. The 3d Figure represents a
<HI>Japan</HI> Nautilus-shell, crenated on the sides, and knobbed on the back, much
In the manner as several of the Snakes-stones are. The 4th Figure represents
a small Piece of a peculiar kind of Nautilus, whose conical Body is divided by
small Diaphragms under every of the black circuling Lines, and is coil'd so
as its roundness is kept, and the Parts do not touch one another. The Name
of it▪ I know not, being no where describ'd by any Author.</P>
<P>In Table III. I have described some sorts of Helmet-stones, of which I
have a very great Variety, and it would have been tedious to have added
them all in this Place. I have likewise described three sorts of Button-stones,
all, and every of which seem to have been nothing else but the filling up of
several sorts of Echini-shells, of which the European Coasts afford a great
Variety. The 1st, 2d, and 3d Figures, represent three several sorts of But∣ton-stones,
all of them of very hard Flints, two of them, namely the two
less, join'd to, or shap'd as 'twere out of irregular Pieces of Flint of the same
Substance. They have all of them this in common with all the other sorts
of Helmet-stones, that they have two Parts, which seem to have been the
fillings up of two Holes or Vents in the Shell, and they are divided into
five Parts, though every of them of distinct Shapes, as may be seen by the
Figures. That of the 1st Figure also hath this Property, in common with
the finer sort of Helmet-stones, that it exhibits the Sutures or Junctures of
the Shell, as are more plainly to be seen in the 4th, 5th, and 6th Figures.
The 4th Figure represents a Helmet-stone, look'd down upon almost di∣rectly,

exhibiting the Impressions of the several Holes, Sutures, and Cracks
that appear upon the top of one of these Stones The 5th and 6th Figures
represent another Helmet-stone of the same kind with the former, but less
look'd upon against the bottom and side, exhibiting the Impressions of the
several Holes, Sutures, and Cracks, that were in the imprinting Shell from
which these Stones, receiv'd their Shape: These were both of a kind of grey
Flint. The 7th Figure represents the bottom of another sort of Helmet-stone,
where the Vents <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> are placed in another manner, than they
were in the 1st, 2d, 3d, or 5th Figures. The 8th and 9th Figures repre∣sent
the bottom and top of another sort of Helmet-stone, which seems to be
the filling up of a kind of <HI>Echini</HI>-shell, very like to those found in <HI>Devonshire</HI>
and <HI>Cornwal,</HI> one of which I have delineated in the 10th Figure: This last
kind was of Chalk. I have several other sorts, which I have not now time
to delineate, some of transparent Pebbles, some of Marble, some of a Stone
as hard as <HI>Portland,</HI> some of black, red, grey, and other Flints, some of Co∣peras-stone,
some of other kinds of Stone, none of Spar. I would to this
have added the Description of a great Variety of <HI>Echini</HI>-shells, divers of which
I have by me in the Repository of the Royal Society, and others that I have
met with elsewhere, but that I shall do it elsewhere: They are indeed almost
infinite, but all concur in these Properties which all Helmet-stones likewise
have. First, that they are distinguish'd into five Parts, by Sutures, Ribs, and
Furrows. Secondly, that they have two Vent-holes: They have divers of
them also little Edges, being the Impressions of the Sutures, and divers lit∣tle
rows of Pins, being the Impressions of the small Holes; and any one that
will diligently and impartially examine both the Stones and the Shells, and
compare the one with the other, will, I can assure him, find greater reason
to perswade him of the Truth of my Position, than any I have yet urged, or
can well produce in Words; no Peswasions being more prevalent than those
which these dumb Witnesses do insinuate.</P>

nor do I know any thing of the History concerning the Places where they

</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATE><HI>Bristol, Aug.</HI> 17. 1687.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>IN answer to some of your Enquiries, as to the <HI>Cornua Ammonis,</HI> and other
Shell-like Stones found about <HI>Keinsham,</HI> and other Places, I shall give
you this short Information of my Discoveries, and present you with the
Draughts of some I happen'd to meet with there, and in other Places not
very far distant, that is, in Part of <HI>Gloucester</HI> and <HI>Somersetshire.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Cornua Ammonis,</HI> near <HI>Keinsham,</HI> lie most of them upon a little Hill, or
rising Ground, above <HI>Keinsham</HI>-Bridge; the Place, as I take it, is about 18
Foot above the River: The River there runs half round the Foot of the Hill,
where they lye very thick almost to touch each other, and are all of the large
fort bedded in an hard Rock or Stone; some also I found near a Mile from
thence in the Stone-walls of their Fields, and on the way in the Lanes; and
at <HI>Stowey,</HI> four or five Miles from <HI>Keinsham,</HI> I saw some Snake-stones, Oyster,
and Cockle-shells petrified and bedded in hard Stone, where is also a petri∣fying
Spring incrustating the Moss and Grass, and all the wooden Troughs,
by which it is conveyed with a stony Substance. Where they are not found
fastned to a Rock, I found them encompassed in a pretty large irregular
Mass of Stone, not sandy, but rather like a whitish Clay harden'd, and these
stony Masses bedded in a loamy kind of Earth; in which soft Earth are also
found Star-stones, and a sort of petrified Cockle-shells, such as Fig. 7. Tab.
VI. 1 found none of the Snake-stones to have above 6 Turns, except one
Mr. <HI>Beaumont</HI> shewed me of seven, and another amongst Mr. <HI>cole</HI>'s Rareties.
But that which I esteemed the greatest Curiosity, was a large Stone of the
true Shape and Figure of the common, <HI>Nautilus,</HI> or Mother of Pearl-shell,
which tho' but a part of the whole Shell, weighs about 30 pound: This I
found in one of the dry Walls, near <HI>Keinsham,</HI> and not far from it another
Piece of the same; these are figured in the VIIth Table, Fig. 1, 2, 3, 4; and
in these not only the Diaphragms are very visible, but the Holes also in the
middle of them, by which the Gut or String passes from one to another, in
all respects answering to that of the <HI>Nautilus</HI>-shell; which, I think, will evince
this at least to be a petrify'd Shell, tho' much larger than any of that kind
that have been yet mention'd. Going down from <HI>Mendip</HI>-hills to <HI>Okey</HI>-hole,
I found a small Muscle-shell petrify'd, on this the Shell was yet discoverable
in some Places; this is figured, Tab. VI. Fig. 1.</P>
<P>On the Face of the Rocks that are on the sides of the <HI>Avon,</HI> not far from
St. <HI>Vincent</HI>'s Rock, I found several wood-like Pieces of Stone standing out a
little from the Rock it self; some of which I have broke off, and have repre∣sented
them in the Figures, Tab. VII. Fig. 5, 6, 7, and 8, and some such like
Bits of Wood in the Earth between the Layers of Stone unpetrify'd. But I
shall at present detain you no longer, but for a more exact Information refer
to the Figures themselves; which I can assure you are truly design'd, and are
all Stones or Petrifactions, except the 6th Figure.</P>

<P>These, and the like Shapes, because many of them are curious, have so far
wrought on same Men, that they have endeavoured to give us an Expli∣cation
of the manner of their Formation; in doing of which they have so far
rambled from the true and genuine Cause of them, that they have left the
Matter much more difficult than they found it. Amongst the rest, <HI>Gaffarel,</HI> a
<PB N="288" REF="265"/>
<HI>French</HI> Writer, seems not the least mistaken, who has transferr'd them over
to the Confirmation, as he thinks, of his Astrological and Magical Fancy;
and thinks that as they were produced from some extraordinary Celestial
Influence, and that the Aspects and Positions of the fix'd Stars and Planets
conduc'd to their Generation, so that they also have in them a secret Vertue
whereby they do at a distance work Miracles on things of the like Shape.
But these, as fantastical and groundless, I shall not spend time on at present
to refute, nor on the Conjectures and Hypotheses of divers others; which
though perhaps somewhat more tolerable than that I last recited, yet most
of them have recourse to some vegetative or plastick Vertue inherent in the
Parts of the Earth where they were made, or in the very parcels of which
they consist, which, to me, seems not at all consonant to the other workings
of Nature; for those more curiously carved and beautiful Forms are usually
bestow'd on some vegetable or animal Body. But my Business at present
shall not be so much to confute others Conjectures, as to make probable some
of my own; which tho' at the first hearing they may seem somewhat para∣doxical,
yet if the Reasons that have induced me thereunto be well consi∣der'd
and weigh'd, I hope at least they may seem possibie, if not more than a
little probable.</P>
<P>The particular Productions of this kind that I have taken notice of my
self in my own Enquiries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Enumeration of the Phenomena.</NOTE> and which I find dispersed up and down in the
Writing of others, may be reduced under some one or other of these Gene∣ral
Heads or Propositions.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1"/>First, That there are found in most Countries of the Earth, and even in
such where it is somewhat difficult to imagine (by reason of their vast distance
from the Sea or Waters how they should come there) great quantities of
Bodies resembling both in Substance and Shape the Shells of divers sorts of
Shell-fishes; and many of them so exactly, that any one that knew not
whence they came, would without the least scruple firmly believe them to be
the Shells of such Fishes: But being found in Places so unlikely to have pro∣duced
them, and not conceiving how else they should come there, they are
generally believed to be real Stones form'd into these Shapes, either by some
plastick Vertue inherent in those Parts of the Earth, which is extravagant
enough, or else by some Celestial Influence or Aspect of the Planets operating
at a distance upon the yielding Matter of the Parts of the Earth, which is
much more extravagant. Of this kind are all those several sorts of Oyster-shells,
Cockle-shells, Muscle-shells, Periwinkle-shells, and the like, which
are found in <HI>England, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Norway, Russia, Asia</HI>
and <HI>Africa,</HI> and divers other Places; of which I have very good Testimonies
from Authors of good Credit.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"/>Secondly, That there often have been, and are still daily found in other
Parts of the Earth buried below the present Surface thereof divers sorts of
Bodies, besides such as I newly mention'd, resembling both in Shape, Sub∣stance,
and other Proprieties, the Parts of Vegetables, having the perfect
Rind or Bark, Pith, Pores, Roots, Branches, Gums, and other constituent
Parts of Wood, though in another posture, lying for the most part Horizon∣tal,
and sometimes inverted, and much differing from that of the like Vege∣tables
when growing, and wanting also, for the most part, the Leaves, smal∣ler
Roots and Branches, the Flower and Fruit, and the like smaller Parts,
which are common to Trees of that kind; of which sort is the <HI>Lignum Fossile,</HI>
which is found in divers Parts of <HI>England, Scotland, Ireland,</HI> and divers Parts
of <HI>Italy, Germany,</HI> the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> and indeed almost in every Country
of the World.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3"/>Thirdly, That there are often found in divers other Parts of the Earth,
Bodies resembling the whole Bodies of Fishes, and other Animals and Vege∣tables,
or the Parts of them, which are of a much less permanent Nature than
the Shells abovemention'd, such as Fruits, Leaves, Barks, Woods, Roots,
Mushrooms, Bones, Hoofs, Claws, Horns, Teeth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but in all other Pro∣prieties
<PB N="289" REF="266"/>
of their Substance, save their Shape, are perfect Stones, Clays, or
Earths, and seem to have nothing at all of Figure in the inward Parts of
them. Of this kind are those, commonly call'd Thunder-bolts, Helmet-stones,
Serpentine-stones, or Snake-stones, Rams-horns, Brain-stones, Star-stones,
Screw-stones, Wheel-stones, and the like.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That the Parts of the Earth in which these kinds have been<MILESTONE N="4"/>
found, are some of them some hundred of Miles distant from any Sea, as in
several of the Hills of <HI>Hungary,</HI> the Mountain <HI>Taurus,</HI> the <HI>Alpes, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, That divers of those Parts are many Scores, nay, some many<MILESTONE N="5"/>
Hundreds of Fathoms above the Level of the Surface of the next adjoining
Sea, there having been found of them on some of the most Inland, and on
some of the highest Mountains in the World.</P>
<P>Sixthly, That divers other Parts where these Substances have been found,<MILESTONE N="6"/>
are many Fathoms below the Level both of the Surface of the next adjoining
Sea, and of the Surface of the Earth itself, they having been found buried in
the bottoms of some of the deepest Mines and Wells, and inclosed in some of
the hardest Rocks and toughest Metals. Of this we have continual Instances
in the deapest Lead and Tin-mines, and a particular Instance in the Well dug
in <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> where at the Depth of 99 Foot was found a Layer of Sea-shells
mixed with Sand of 4 Foot thickness, after the Diggers had past through
7 Foot of Garden-mould, 9 Foot more of black Peat, 9 Foot more of soft
Clay, 8 of Sand, 4 of Earth, 10 of Potters-clay, 4 more of Earth, 10 Foot
more of Sand, upon which the Stakes or Piles of the <HI>Amsterdam</HI> Houses rest;
then 2 Foot more of Potters-clay, and 4 of white Gravel, 5 of dry Earth,
1 of mix'd, 14 of Sand, 3 of a Sandy Clay, and 5 more of Potters-clay mix'd
with Sand. Now below this Layer of Shells immediately joining to it, was a
Bed of Potters-clay of no less than 102 Foot thick; but of this more
hereafter.</P>
<P>Seventhly, That there are often found in the midst of the Bodies of very<MILESTONE N="7"/>
hard and close Stone, such as Marbles, Flints, <HI>Portland,</HI> and Purbeck-stone,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> which lye upon, or very near to the Surface of the Earth, great quantities
of these kind of figured Bodies or Shells, and that there are many of such
Stones which seem to be made of nothing else.</P>
<P>These Phaenomena, as they have hitherto much puzzled all Natural Historians
and Philosophers to give an Account of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Difficulty may be solved.</NOTE> so in truth are they in themselves so
really wonderful, that 'tis not easie without making multitudes of Observations,
and comparing them very diligently with the Histories and Experiments that
have been already made, to fix upon a plausible Solution of them. For as
on the one side, it seems very difficult to imagine that Nature formed all
these curious Bodies for no other End, than only to play the Mimick in the
Mineral Kingdom, and only to imitate what she had done for some more
noble End, and in a greater Perfection in the Vegetable and Animal King∣doms;
and the strictest Survey that I have made both of the Bodies them∣selves,
and of the Circumstances obvious enough about them, do not in the
least hint any thing else; they being promiscuously found of any kind of Sub∣stance,
and having not the least appearance of any internal or substantial
Form, but only of an external or figured Superficies. As, I say, 'tis some∣thing
harsh, to imagine that these thus qualified Bodies should, by an imme∣diate
plastick Vertue, be thus shaped by Nature contrary to her general Me∣thod
of acting in all other Bodies; so on the other side, it may seem at first
hearing somewhat difficult to conceive how all those Bodies, if they either be
the real Shells or Bodies of Fish, or other Animals or Vegetables, which they
represent, or an Impression left on those Substances from such Bodies, should
be, in such great quantities, transported into Places so unlikely to have re∣ceived
them from any help of Man, or from any other obvious Means.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="267"/>
The former of these ways of solving these Phaenomena, I confess I cannot
for the Reasons I now mention'd, by any means assent unto; but the latter,
tho' it has some Difficulties also, seems to me not only possible, but pro∣bable.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1"/>The greatest Objections that can be made against it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Object.</NOTE> are, First, by what
means those Shells, Woods, and other such like Substances (if they really
are the Bodies they represent) should be transported to, and be buried in
the Places where they are found? And,</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"/>Secondly, Why many of them should be of Substances wholly differing
from those of the Bodies they represent; there being some of them which
represent Shells of almost all kinds of Substances, Clay, Chalk, Marble, soft
Stone, harder Stone, Marble, Flint, Marchasite, Ore, and the like.</P>
<P>In answer to both which, and some other of less Importance, which I shall
afterwards mention, give me leave to propound these following Propositions,
which I shall endeavour to make probable. Of these in their Order.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1"/>My first Proposition then is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Answered by these Propositions.</NOTE> That all, or the greatest part of these curiously
figured Bodies found up and down in divers Parts of the World, are either
those Animal or Vegetable Substances they represent converted into Stone,
by having their Pores fill'd up with some petrisying liquid Substance, where∣by
their Parts are, as it were, lock'd up and cemented together in their Na∣tural
Position and Contexture; or else they are the lasting Impressions made
on them at first, whilst a yielding Substance by the immediate Application of
fuch Animal or Vegetable Body as was so shaped, and that there was nothing
else concurring to their Production, save only the yielding of the Matter to
receive the Impression, such as heated Wax affords to the Seal; or else a sub∣siding
or hardning of the Matter, after by some kind of Fluidity it had per∣fectly
fill'd or inclosed the figuring Vegetable or Animal Substance, after the
manner as a Statue is made of Plaister of <HI>Paris,</HI> or Alabaster-dust beaten, and
boil'd, mixed with Water and poured into a Mould.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"/>Secondly, Next that there seems to have been some extraordinary Cause,
which did concur to the promoting of this Coagulation or Petrification,
and that every kind of Matter is not of it self apt to coagulate into a strong
Substance, so hard as we find most of those Bodies to consist of.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3"/>Thirdly, That the concurrent Causes assisting towards the turning of these
Substances into Stone, seem to have been one of these, either some kind of
fiery Exhalation arising from subterraneous Eruptions or Earthquakes; or
secondly, a Saline Substance, whither working by Dissolution and Congela∣tion,
or Crystallization, or else by Precipitation and Coagulation; or thirdly,
some glutinous or bituminous Matter, which upon growing dry or setling
grows hard, and unites sandy Bodies together into a pretty hard Stone; or
fourthly, a very long continuation of these Bodies under a great degree of
Cold and Compression.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="4"/>Fourthly, That Waters themselves may in tract of time be perfectly trans∣muted
into Stone, and remain a Body of that Constitution without being re∣ducible
by any Art yet commonly known.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="5"/>Fifthly, That divers other fluid Substances have after a long continuance at
rest, have settled and congealed into much more hard and permanent Substances.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="6"/>Sixthly. That a great part of the Surface of the Earth hath been since the
Creation transformed and made of another Nature; namely, many Parts
which have been Sea are now Land, and divers other Parts are now Sea
which were once a firm Land; Mountains have been turned into Plains, and
Plains into Mountains, and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="268"/>
Seventhly, That divers of these kind of Transformations have been effected<MILESTONE N="7"/>
in these Islands of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> and that 'tis not improbable, but that ma∣ny
very Inland Parts of this Island, if not all, may have been heretofore all
cover'd with the Sea, and have had Fishes swimming over it.</P>
<P>Eighthly, That most of those Inland Places, where these kinds of Stones<MILESTONE N="8"/>
are, or have been found, have been heretofore under the Water; and that
either by the departing of the Waters to another part or side of the Earth,
by the alteration of the Center of Gravity of the whole Bulk, which is not
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>upossible; or rather by the Eruption of some kind of subterraneous Fires,
or Earthquakes, whereby great quantities of Earth have then been rais'd
above the former Level of those Parts, the Waters have been forc'd away
from the Parts they formerly cover'd, and many of those Surfaces are now
raised above the Level of the Water's Surface many scores of Fathoms.</P>
<P>Ninthly, It seems not improbable, that the tops of the highest and most<MILESTONE N="9"/>
considerable Mountains in the World have been under Water, and that they
themselves most probably seem to have been the Effects of some very great
Earthquake, such as the <HI>Alpes</HI> and Appennine Mountains, <HI>Caucasus</HI> the Pike
of <HI>Tenariff,</HI> the Pike in the <HI>Tercer as,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>Tenthly, That it seems not improbable, but that the greatest part of the<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Inequality of the Earth's Surface may have proceeded from the Subversion and
tumbling thereof by some preceding Earthquakes.</P>
<P>Eleventhly, That there have been many other Species of Creatures in for∣mer<MILESTONE N="11"/>
Ages, of which we can find none at present; and that 'tis not unlikely
also but that there may be divers new kinds now, which have not been from
the beginning.</P>
<P>There are some other Conjectures of mine yet unmention'd, which are
more strange than these; which I shall defer the mentioning of till some
other time; because tho' I have divers Observations concurring, yet having
not been able to meet with such as may answer some considerable Objections
that they are liable to, I will rather at present endeavour to make probable
those already mentioned, by setting down some of those Observations (for it
would be tedious to insert all) I have collected, both out of Authors, and
from my own Experience.</P>
<P>The First was, That these figured, Bodies, dispersed over the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Pro∣position confir∣med.</NOTE> are
either the Beings themselves pretrify'd, or the Impressions made by those
Beings. To confirm which, I have diligently examin'd many hundreds of
these figured Bodies, and have not found the least probability of a plastick
Faculty. For first, I have found the same kind of Impression upon Substan∣ces
of an exceeding differing Nature, whereas Nature in other of her Works
does adapt the same kind of Substance to the same Shape; the Flesh of a
Horse is differing from that of a Hog, or Sheep, or from the Wood of a
Tree, or the like; so the Wood of Box, for Instance, is differing from the
Wood of all other Vegetables; and if the outward Figure of the Plant or
Animal differ, to be sure their Flesh also differs: And under the same Shape
you always meet with Substances of the same kind; whereas here I have ob∣served
Stones bearing the same Figure, or rather Impression, to be of hugely
differing Natures, some of Clay, some of Chalk, some of Spar, some of Mar∣ble,
some of a kind of Free-stone, some like Crystals or Diamonds, some
like Flints, others a kind of Marchasite, others a kind of Ore. Nay, in
the same figur'd Substance I have found divers sorts of very differing Bodies
or kinds of Stone, so that one has been made up partly of Stone, partly of
Clay, and partly of Marchasite, and partly of Spar, according as the Mat∣ter
chanced to be jumbled together, and to fill up the Mould of the Shell.</P>
<P>Another Circumstance, which makes this Conjecture the more probable,
is, that the outward Surface only of the Body is form'd, and that the inward
<PB N="292" REF="269"/>
Part has nothing of Shape that can reasonably be referr'd to it; whereas we
see that in all other Bodies that Nature gives a Shape to, she figures also the
internal Parts or the very Substance of it, with an appropriate Shape. Thus
in all kinds of Minerals, as Spars, Crystals, and divers of the precious
Stones, Ores, and the like, the inward Parts of them are always correspon∣dent
to the outward Shape; as in Spar, if the outward Part be shap'd into a
Rhomboidical parallepiped, the inward Part of it is shap'd in the same
manner, and may be cleft out into a multitude of Bodies of the like Form
and Substance.</P>
<P>Another Circumstance is, that I have in many found the perfect Shell in∣closed
making a concave Impression on the Body that inclosed it, and a con∣vex
on the Body that it did inclose; which I have sometimes been able to
take out intire, and found it to be both by its Substance and Shape, and re∣flective
shining, and the like Circumstances, a real Shell of a Cockle, Peri∣winkle,
Muscle, or the like.</P>
<P>And farther, I have found in the same place divers of the same kinds of
Shells, not fill'd with a Matter that was capable of taking the Impression,
but with a kind of sandy Substance; which lying loose within it could be ea∣sily
shook out, leaving the inclosing Shell perfectly intire and empty; others
I have seen which have been of black Flint, wherein the Impression has been
made only of a broken Shell, which stuck also into it; the other Part of the
Surface of that Stone, which was not within the Shell, remaining only form'd
like a common Flint.</P>
<P>And which seems to confirm this Conjecture much more than any of the
former Arguments, I had this last Summer an Opportunity to observe upon
the South-part of <HI>England,</HI> in a Clift whose Bottom the Sea wash'd, that at a
good, heighth in the Clift above the Surface of the Water, there was a Lay∣er,
as I may call it, or Vein of Shells, which was extended in length for some
Miles: Out of which Layer I digg'd out, and examin'd many hundreds, and
found them to be perfect Shells of Cockles, Periwinkles, Muscles, and divers
other sorts of small Shell-Fishes; some of which were fill'd with the Sand
with which they were mix'd; others remain'd empty, and perfectly intire:
From the Sea-waters washing the under part of this Clift, great quantities of
it do every Year tumble or founder down, and fall into the Salt-water, which
are wash'd also by several Mineral-waters issuing out at the bottom of those
Clifts. Of these founder'd Parts I examined very many Parcels, and found
some of them made into a kind of harden'd Mortar, or very soft Stone,
which I could easily with my Foot, and even almost with my Finger, crush in
Pieces; others that had lain a longer time exposed to the Vicissitudes of the
rising and falling Tides, I found grown into pretty hard Stones; others that
had been yet longer, I found converted into very hard Stone, not much yield∣ing
to the hardness of Flints. Out of divers of these, I was able to break
and beat out divers intire and perfect Shells, fill'd with a Substance which
was converted into a very hard Stone, retaining exactly the Shape of the in∣closing
Shell. And in the part of the Stone which had encompass'd the Shell,
there was left remaining the perfect Impression and Form of the Shell; the
Shell it self remaining as yet of its natural white Substance, though much de∣cay'd
or rotted by time: But the Body inclosing and included by the Shell, I
found exactly stamp'd like those Bodies, whose Figures Authors generally
affirm to be the Product of a Plastick or Vegetative Faculty working in
Stones.</P>
<P>Another Argument, that these petrify'd Substances are nothing but the
Effects of those Shells being fill'd with some petrifying Substance, is this,
That among those which are call'd <HI>Cornu-Ammonis,</HI> or Serpentine-stones,
(found about <HI>Keinsham,</HI> and in several other Parts of <HI>England,</HI> and in other
Countries, as at the <HI>Balnea Bollensia)</HI> which are indeed nothing else but the
moulding off from a kind of Shell which is much shap'd like a <HI>Nautilus</HI>-shell,
the whole Cavity being separated with divers small Valves or Partitions,
much after the same manner as those Shells of the <HI>Nautilus</HI> are commonly
observed to be. Among these Stones, I say, I have, upon breaking, found
some of the Cavities between those Partitions remain almost quite empty;
<PB N="293" REF="270"/>
others I have found lined only with a kind of Tartareous, or rather Crystal∣line
Substance, which has stuck to the sides, and been figured like Tartar, but
of a clear and transparent Substance like Crystal; whereas others of the Ca∣vities
of the same Stone I have found filled with divers kinds of Substances
very differing: Whence I imagine those Tartareous Substances to be nought
else but the hardning of some saline fluid Body, which might soak in through
the Substance of the Shell. Others of these I have, which are quite of a
transparent Substance, and seem to be produced from the Petrifaction of the
Water that had fill'd them; others I have found fill'd with a perfect Flint,
both which I suppose to be the productions of Water petrify'd: And I may
perhaps hereafter make it probable, that all kinds of Flints and Pebbles have
no other Original.</P>
<P>I could urge many other Arguments to make my first Proposition probable,
that all those curiously shaped Stones, which the most curious Naturalists most
admire, are nothing but the Impressions made by some real Shell in a Matter
that at first was yielding enough, but which is grown harder with time. To
this very Head also may be referr'd all those other kinds of petrify'd Sub∣stances,
as Bones, Teeth, Crabbs, Fishes, Wood, Moss, Fruit, and the like;
some of all which Kinds I have examin'd, and by very many Circumstances,
too long to be here inserted, judge them to be nothing else but a real petri∣faction
of those Substances they resemble.</P>
<P>My Second Proposition will not be difficult to prove,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second pro∣position corfir∣med.</NOTE> That if these be
the Effects of Petrifaction or Coagulation, it must be from some extraordi∣nary
Cause. And this because we find not many Experiments of producing
of them when and where we will; besides we find that most things, especially
Animal and Vegetable Substances, after they have left off to vegetate, do
soon decay, and by divers ways of Putrefaction and Rotting, loose their
Forms and return into Dust; as we find Wood, whether exposed to the Air
or Water, in a little time to waste and decay; especially such as is exposed
to the alteration of both, and even in those Places where these petrify'd Sub∣stances
are to be met with. The like we find of Animal Substances; and
we have but some few Experiments of preserving those Bodies, to make
them as permanent as Stone, and fewer of making them into a Substance of
the like Nature.</P>
<P>The Third thing therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The thir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pro∣position confir∣med.</NOTE> which I shall endeavour to shew, is, That the
concurring Causes to these Petrifactions seem to be either some kind of petri∣fying
Water, or else some salin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or sulphureous Mixture, with the concur∣rence
of Heat, from some subterrancous Fire or Earthquake, or else a very
long Continuation of those Bodies under a great degree of Cold and Com∣pression,
and Rest. That petrifying Waters may be able to convert both
Animal and Vegetable Substances into Stone, I could, besides several Tri∣als
of my own, bring multitudes of Relations out of Natural Historians: But
these are so common almost in all Countries, and so commonly taken notice of
by the Curious, that I need not instance. <HI>Cambden</HI> and <HI>Speed</HI> will tell you of
abundance here in <HI>England,</HI> as the <HI>Peak</HI> in <HI>Derbyshtre,</HI> and in several other
subterraneous Caverns in <HI>England.</HI> The Water it self does, by degrees, pro∣duce
several conical pendulous Bodies of Stone, shap'd and hanging like Ici∣cles
from the Roof of the Vault; and dropping on the bottom, it raises up also
conical Spires, which, by degrees, endeavour to meet the former pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dulous
<HI>Stiriae.</HI> And indeed I have generally observ'd it, that wherever there is a
Vault made with Lime under Ground, into which the Rain-Water soaking
through, a pretty thickness of Ground, does at last penetrate through the
Arch; I have in several places, I say, observ'd that that Water does incru∣state
the Roof with Stone, and in many places of it generate small pen∣dulous
Icicles. This Water I have found in a little time to incrustate Sticks,
or the like Vegetable Substances with Stone, and in some places to penetrate
into the Pores of the Wood, filling them up with small Cylinders of Stone.
This I have observ'd also in divres of the Arches of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Church,
which have been uncover'd and have lain open to the Rain, though there be
<PB N="294" REF="271"/>
no Earth for it to soak through. And tho' I have never yet been able to pe∣trify
a Stick throughout, yet I have now by me several pieces that retain so
perfectly all the Figure of Wood, and are yet so perfectly in all other pro∣preties
Stone, that I find not the least Reason of doubt to believe that those
pieces have been actual Wood, having still the Bark, the Clefts, the Knots,
the Grain, the Pores, and even those too which, for their smalness, I have
elsewhere call'd Microscopical, tho' I confess some of these more perfect pieces
seem to have been petrify'd from some more subtile and insinuating petrify∣ing
Water, than those I newly mention'd, and 'tis not improbable but that
some Subterraneaous Steams and Heat may have contributad somewhat to∣wards
this Effect. But first I shall endeavour to make it probable, that these
petrify'd Bodies may have been placed in those Parts where they are found,
by some kind of Transformation wrought on the Surface of the Earth, by
some Earth-quake: And to this end, I shall by and by mention some strange al∣terations
that have been made by Earthquakes, after I have first made pro∣bable
my fourth Conjecture.</P>
<P>The Fourth Pro∣position therefore to be explain'd and made probable is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fourth Proposition confir∣med.</NOTE>
That Waters themselves of divers Kinds, are, and may have been transmuted
perfectly into a stony Substance, of a very permanent Constitution, being
scarcely reducible again into Water by any Art yet commonly known. And
that divers other Liquid or Fluid Substances have in tract of time settled
and congealed into much more hard, fixt, solid and permanent Forms than they
were of at first.</P>
<P>The probability of which Proposition may appear from these Particulars.</P>
<P>1. That almost in all Streams and running Waters there is to be found
great quantity of Sand at the bottom, many of which Sands both by their Fi∣gure
in the Microscope, and transparently, seem to have been generated out
of the Water.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st. Arg.</NOTE> I say, That their transparency which they discover in the Micro∣scope
is an Argument, because I believe there is no transparent Body in the
World that has not been redue'd to that Constitution by being some ways or
other made fluid, nor can I indeed imagine how there should be any. All
Bodies, made transparent by Art, must be reduc'd into that Form first; and
therefore 'tis not unlikely but that Nature may take the same Course; but this
as only probable I shall not insist on. Next, I say, that the Figures of di∣verse
of them in the Microscope discover the same things; for I have seen
multitudes of them curiously wrought and figured like Crystal or Diamonds,
and I cannot imagine by what other Instrument Nature should thus cut them,
save by Crystalizing them out of a Liquid or Fluid Body, and that way we
find her to work in the formation of all those curious regular Figures of Salts,
and the Vitriols (as I may call them) of Metals and divers other Bodies, of
which Chymistry affords many Instances. Sea-Salt and Salgem chrystylizeth
into Cubes or four-sided Parrallelipipeds; Niter into triangular and hexangular
Prisms. Alume into Octoedrons, Vitriols into various kinds of Figures, ac∣cording
to the various kinds of Metals dissolved, and the various <HI>Menstrua.</HI>
dissolving them; Tartars also, and Candyings of Vegetables are figured into
their various regular Shapes from the same Method and Principle. And in truth,
in the formation of any Body out of this mineral Kingdom, whose Origine
we are able to examine, we may find that Nature, first reduces the Bodies to
be wrought on into a liquid or soft Substance, and afterwards forms and
shapes it into this or that Figure. But this Argument drawn from the Sand,
found in all running Streams, I shall not insist on, because some imagine it
to be only washt off from the Land and Shores the River passes over, and
perpaps much of it may: But yet that Sand may be made of clear Wa∣ter,
this second Argument will manifest, and that is this:</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="272"/>
That 'tis a usual Experiment in the making of Salt in the Salterns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d. Arg.</NOTE> by
the boyling up, or evaporating away the fresher part of the Sea-water, to
collect great quantities of Sand at each corner of the Boyler; which, after
it has been well washt with fresh Water, is, in all particulars, a perfect
Sand; and yet the Water is so order'd before it is put into the Boyler, that
nothing of Sand or Dregs can enter with it, the B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne being first suffer'd to
stand a good while and settle in a very large Fat, so that all the Sand and
Dregs may sink to the bottom; after which, the clearer Water at the
top is drawn off, and suffer'd to run into the Boyler. 'Tis not impossible,
perhaps, but that Substance which made this Sand, might be dissolved in
Water, and afterwards by evaparation coagulated; which, if so, makes not at
all against, but rather argues strongly for my fourth Proposition.</P>
<P>But that the other Solution is something more probable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d. <HI>Arg</HI></NOTE> namely, That
'tis made out of the very Substance of the Water itself, this third Argu∣ment
will make probable; and that is, that any Water of what kind soever,
tho' never so clear and insipid, may, by frequent Distillations, be all of it
perfectly transmitted into a white insipid Calx not again dissolvable in Wa∣ter,
and in nothing differing from the Substance of Stone; this I have been
assured by an eminent Physician, who has divers times made tryal of it with
the same success. If therefore the whole Body of any Water may, by so easy
an Operation in so very short a time, be transmuted into a stony Substance,
what may not Nature do that can take her own time, and knows best how
to make use of her own Principles?</P>
<P>But 4<HI>thy.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">4th. <HI>Arg.</HI></NOTE> we have many Instances by which we are assured that Nature realy
does change Water into Stone, both by forming in a little time considera∣ble
Stones out of the distilling Drops of Water soaking through the Roofs
of Caves and subterraneous Vaults, of which we have very many Instances
here in <HI>England;</HI> as to name one for all at the Peak in <HI>Derbyshire,</HI> the pendu∣lous
Cones of this petrify'd Substance directly point at, and oftentimes meet
and rest on the rising, Spires, generated by the drops of Water trickling
through the Roof, as I mention'd before</P>
<P>And 5<HI>thy.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">5th. <HI>Arg</HI></NOTE> there are divers other Waters which we need not seek after in
Caves that have a petrifying vertue, and incrustate all the Chanel they pass
through, and the Substances soak'd in them with Stone; these are so com∣mon
almost in all places, that I need not instance in any; only I cannot pass
by one, which is taken notice of by <HI>Kircher</HI> in his <HI>Mundus Subterraneus,</HI> being
Observations made by himself, and it has in it two Circumstances very con∣siderable;
the first is, That Vegetables should grow so plentifully in a very
hot Water. The second, that only such Herbs as grew in it, and not such
as were Steeped in it, will perfectly, after drying, be turned into Stone, of
which I shall afterwards have occasion to make more use. I shall give the History
in his own Words, as they are set down in the 7th Paragraph of the
2d Sect. of the 5th Book of his <HI>Mundus Subterraneus, Haec</HI> (says he) <HI>experien∣tia
didici in Itinere meo Hetrusco, in quo prope Koncol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>num senensis territorri Oppi∣dum</HI>

istas extirpat as nunquam Lapidescere.</HI> I pass by his Reasons and Explications,
because I think them very little to the Purpose: But the Observations them∣selves
are very considerable, and serve for the explaining of severeal Pheno∣mena
I have observ'd in petrify'd Bodies, as I shall indeavour hereafter to shew,
as in Corals, both Red, White, and the several Rarities of them, in Coral∣lines
<PB N="296" REF="273"/>
lines also, and petrify'd Mushromes, of each of which I have examined a
very great variety. But this only by the by.</P>
<P><HI>6thly.</HI> Therefore 'tis observable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th <HI>Arg.</HI></NOTE> that these petrifying Waters are for the
most part very clear and limpid; so that to the Sight 'tis not distinguishable
from other Water: But only by the Effects, and therefore by the newly
mention'd Observations of <HI>Kircher,</HI> we find that Vegetables, that upon dry∣ing
turn'd into Stone; whilst green and growing flourished and spread faster
than others; so that the petrifying Substance past through the finest and
closest Pores of the living Vegetables, and therefore must certainly be very
intimately mixt with the Water that could not be separated by so fine and
curious Strainers.</P>
<P>But <HI>7thly.</HI> To confirm this Proposition yet further,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th. <HI>Arg.</HI></NOTE> there are found in se∣veral
parts of the Earth, such Waters will be intirely converted into Stone.
Of this kind there are several Histories in the newly-mention'd Book, which
I pass over, and shall only take notice of one for all, and that is in an Ac∣count
sent to the <HI>Roman</HI> Coledge of Jesuits from the Masters, Surveyors and
Clerks of the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Mines, in Answer to some Queries propounded to
them. Page 183. of <HI>Kircher</HI>'s <HI>Mundus Subterraneus,</HI> to the Query concern∣ing
the Properties and Metallick Experiments about Meneral Waters, they
answer, That <HI>Datur in fodinis aquae genus quod in Figuram saccaro haud absimilem
degenerat,</HI> viz. <HI>in Lapillos albas.</HI></P>
<P>And again, Page 185. of the same, from another Prefect, of the Emperial
Mines in <HI>Hungary</HI> in answer to the same Query, we have this Account. <HI>Reperi∣tur
quo{que} aqua quaedam alba quoe in Lapidem durum abit. Si vero haec aqua ante suam
coagulationem mineram cupream transiverit, tunc generatur ex ea lapis qui Malochites
vocatur, quando vero aqua ill<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> perfluit cupream mineram continentem argentum fiet ex
ea pulcher lapis ceruleussimilis Turcoidi. Haec aqua autem nullibi frequentius reperit ur
quam in mineris Lapidibus siliceis copiosis, &amp; cuprum cum argento continentibus.</HI>
Whence I am apt to think, and I have many Observations and Arguments to
confirm my Conjecture,</P>
<P>That <HI>8thly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">8th. <HI>Arg.</HI></NOTE> All kinds of <HI>Talk</HI> and <HI>Spar,</HI> most <HI>Ores</HI> and <HI>Marchasites: Alu∣men
Plumeum, &amp; Asbestus; Fluores, Crystalls,</HI> Cornish-<HI>Diamonds, Amethysts</HI>
and divers other figured Mineral Bodies, may be generated from their Cry∣stalization,
or Coagulation, out of some Mineral Waters.</P>
<P>And to make it yet more probable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th. <HI>Arg.</HI></NOTE> I could in the 9th place add divers
Experiments, by which several of these Concretes may be in a short time made
artificially by several Chymical Operations, which would very much illustrate
the former Doctrin. But I hope what I have mention'd may suffice to make
the fourth Proposition probable, that Waters of divers kinds may be turned
in time to Stone, without being reducible again to Water by any Art yet
commonly known, which being granted, my</P>
<P>Fifth Proposition will follow of consequence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fifth Pro∣position prov∣ed.</NOTE> <HI>viv.</HI> That divers other fluid
Substances, have, after long continuance of rest, settled and congealed into
much more hard and permanent Substances: For if Water it self may be so
changed and metamorphosed, which seems the farthest removed from the
nature of a solid Body, certainly those which are nearer to that Nature, and
are mixt with such Waters, will more easily be coagulated: I shall not there∣fore
any farther insist on the Proof of this, than only to mention two Parti∣culars,
and that because we have almost every where so many Instances and
Experiments; and the first is that of <HI>Pliny</HI> in the 13th Chap. of the 35th
Book of his Natural History, in all which Chapter he gives us divers Instances
of several kinds of Earth, which, by the Sea-water and Air, converted into
into solid and hard Stones; his Words are these: <HI>Verum &amp; ipsius Terrae sunt
alia segmenta. Quis enim satis miretur pessimam ejus partem ideo{que} pulverem appel∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uam

Eadem est Terrae Natura &amp; in Cizicena Regione, sed ibi non pulvis verum ipsa Terra,
qualibet magnitudine excisa &amp; demersa, in mare, lapidea extrahitur: hoc idem cir∣ca
Cassandriam produnt fieri: Et in fonte Gnidio dulci intra octo menses Terram la∣pidescere.
Ab Oropo quidem Aulidem usque quicquid Terrae attingitur mari, muta∣tur
in Saxa, &amp;c.</HI> to the end of the Chapter he goes on to relate divers Places
where Earths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are turned into Stones. Also in the 10th Chapter of the
of the 31st Book, speaking of the Nature and Kinds of Niter, he tells about
the middle of the Chapter. <HI>Nitrariae egregiae Aegyptiis nam circa Naucratim &amp;
Memphim tantum solebant esse, circa Memphim deteriores; nam &amp; lapidescit ibi in
acervis, multi{que} sunt Tumuli ea de causa Saxei, fiunt{que} ex his vasa, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Second is an Observation of my own, which I have often taken notice
of, and lately examined very diligently, which will much confirm these Hi∣stories
of <HI>Pliny,</HI> and this my present Hypothesis; and that is a Part of the
Observation I have already mentioned, which I made upon the Western Shore
of the Isle of <HI>Wight.</HI> I observed a Cliff of a pretty height, which, by the con∣stant
washing of the Water at the bottom of it, is continually, especially af∣ter
Frosts and great Rains, foundering and tumbling down into the Sea un∣derneath
it. Along the Shore underneath this Cliff, are a great number of
Rocks and large Stones confusedly placed, some covered, others quite out of
the Water; all which Rocks I found to be compounded of Sand and Clay, and
Shells, and such kind of Stones, as the Shore was covered with. Examining
the Hardness of some that lay as far into the Water as the Low-Water-mark,
I found them to be altogether as hard, if not much harder than <HI>Portland</HI> or
<HI>Purbeck</HI>-stone: Others of them that lay not so far into the Sea, I found much
foster, as having in probability not been so long exposed to the Vicissitudes
of the Tides: Others of them I found so very soft, that I could easily with
my Foot crush them, and make Impressions into them, and could thrust a
Walking-stick I had in my Hand a great depth into them: Others that had
been but newly foundered down, were yet more soft, as having been scarce
wash'd by the Salt Water. All these were perfectly of the same Substance
with the Cliff, from whence they had manifestly tumbled, and consisted of
Layers of Shells, Sand, Clay, Gravel, Earth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and from all the Cir∣cumstances
I could examine, I do judge them to have been the Parts of the
Neigbouring Cliff foundered down, and rowl'd and wash'd by degrees into
the Sea; and, by the petrifying Power of the Salt Water, converted into
perfect hard compacted Stones. I have likewise since observed the like <HI>Phae∣nomena</HI>
on other Shores. And I doubt not but any inquisitive Naturalist may
find infinite of the like Instances all along the Coast of <HI>England,</HI> and other
Countries where there are such kind of foundering Cliffs. I shall not now
mention the great Quantities of toothed Spar, which I observed to be crystal∣lized
upon the sides of these Rocks, which seem'd to have been nothing else
but the meer crystallizing or shooting of some kind of Water, which was
press'd or arose out of these coagulating Stones; For the History of these
kinds of figured Stones belong more properly to another Discourse; namely,
of the Natural Geometrical Figures, observable in Oares, Minerals, Spars,
Talk, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of which elsewhere.</P>
<P>One Instance more I cannot omit, as being the most observable of any I
have yet heard of; and that is, (Dr. <HI>Castle</HI>'s Relation) of a certain' Place at
<HI>Alpsly</HI> in <HI>Bedfordshire,</HI> where there is a corner of a certain Field, that doth per∣fectly
turn Wood and divers other Substances in a very short time into Stone
as hard as a Flint or Agat. A Piece of this kind I saw, affirm'd to have been
there buried, which the Person that buried it had shot small Shots of Lead
into; the whole Substance of the Wood, Bark and Pith, together with the
Leaden Shot it self, was perfectly turn'd to a Stone as hard as any Agat, and
yet retain'd its perfect Shape and Form; and the Lead remain'd round, and
in its place, but much harder than any Iron. Of this I am promised a Sam∣ple,
but have not yet received it.</P>
<P>But to spend no more time, on the proof of that of which we have almost
every where Instances, divers of which I have already mention'd, I shall pro∣ceed
to the 6th Proposition; which is, That a great Part of the Surface of the
<PB N="298" REF="275" MS="y"/>
Earth hath been since the Creation transform'd, and made of another Na∣ture:
that is, many Parts which have been Sea are now Land, and others that
have been Land are now Sea▪ many of the Mountains have been Vales, and
the Vales Mountains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Fot the proving of which Proposition, I shall not need to produce any other
Arguments, besides the repeating what I find set down by divers Natural
Historians, concerning the prodigious Effects that have been produced by
Earthquakes on the superficial Parts of the Earth; because they seem to me
to have been the chief Efficients which have transported these petrify'd Bo∣dies,
Shells, Woods, Animal Substances, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and left them in some Parts
of the Earth, as are no other ways likely to have been the Places wherein such
Substances should be produced; they being usually either raised a great way
above the level Surface of the Earth, on the Tops of high Hills, or else buried
a great way beneath that Surface in the lower Valleys: For who can imagine
that Oysters, Muscles, and Periwinkles, and the like Shell-fish, should ever
have had their Habitation on the Tops of the Mountain <HI>Caucasus?</HI> Which is
by divers of our Geographers accounted as high in its perpendicular Altitude,
as any Mountain in the yet known World; and yet <HI>Olearius</HI> affords us a ve∣ry
considerable History to this purpose of his own Observation, which I shall
hereafter have occasion to relate, and examine more particularly. Or to come
a little nearer home, who could imagine that Oysters, <HI>Echini,</HI> and some other
Shell-fish, should heretofore have lived at the tops of the <HI>Alps, Appennine,</HI>
and <HI>Pyrenian</HI> Mountains, all which abound with great store of several sorts
of Shells; nay, yet nearer at the tops of some of the highest in <HI>Cornwal</HI> and
<HI>Devonshire,</HI> where I have been informed by Persons whose Testimony I cannot
in the least suspect, that they have taken up divers, and seen great Quantities of
them? And to come yet nearer, who can imagine Oysters to have lived on
the Tops of some Hills near <HI>Banstead-Downs</HI> in <HI>Surry?</HI> Where there have beentime
out of Mind, and are still to this day found divers Shells of Oysters,
both on the uppermost Surface, and buried likewise under the Surface of the
Earth, as I was lately informed by several very worthy Persons living near
those Places, and as I my self had the Opportunity to observe and collect.</P>
<P>To proceed then to the Effects of Earthquakes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Effects of Earthquakes.</NOTE> we find in Histories Four
Sorts or <HI>Genus's</HI> to have been performed by them.</P>
<P>The first is the raising of the superficial Parts of the Earth above their
former Level: and under this Head there are Four Species.<NOTE PLACE="marg">First sort or Genus of Effects.</NOTE> The 1st is the
raising of a considerable Part of a Country, which before lay level with the
Sea, and making it lye many Feet, nay, sometimes many Fathoms above its
former height. A 2d is the raising of a considerable part of the bottom of
the Sea, and making it lye above the Surface of the Water, by which means
divers Islands have been generated and produced. A 3d Species is the
raising of very considerable Mountains out of a plain and level Country. And
a 4th Species is the raising of the Parts of the Earth by the throwing on of
a great Access of new Earth, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or burying the former Surface under a co∣vering
of new Earth many Fathoms thick.</P>
<P>A second sort of of Effects perform'd by Earthquakes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Second sort or Genus of Ef∣fects.</NOTE> is the depression or
sinking of the Parts of the Earth's Surface below the former Level. Under
this Head are also comprized four distinct Species, which are directly con∣trary
to the four last named.</P>
<P>The <HI>First,</HI> is a sinking of some Part of the Surface of the Earth, lying a good
way within the Land, and converting it into a Lake of an almost unmeasurable depth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Second,</HI> is the sinking of a considerable Part of the plain Land, near
the Sea, below its former Level, and so suffering the Sea to come in and over∣flow
it, being laid lower than the Surface of the next adjoining Sea.</P>
<P>A <HI>Third</HI> is the sinking of the Parts of the bottom of the Sea much lower,
and creating therein vast <HI>Vorages</HI> and <HI>Abysses.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="276" MS="y"/>
A <HI>Fourth,</HI> is the making bare, or uncovering of divers Parts of the Earth,
which were before a good way below the Surface; and this either by suddenly
throwing away these upper Parts by some subterraneous Motion, or else by
washing them away by some kind of Eruption of Waters from unusual Places,
vomited out by some Earthquake.</P>
<P>A Third sort of Effects produced by Earthquakes, are the Subversions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Third, Sort or <HI>Genus</HI> of Ef∣fects.</NOTE> Con∣versions,
and Transpositions of the Parts of the Earth.</P>
<P>A Fourth sort of <HI>Effects,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fourth Sort or</HI> Genus <HI>of Ef∣fects.</HI></NOTE> are <HI>Liquefaction. Baking, Calcining, Petrifaction,
Transformation, Sublimation, Distillation,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The First therefore of the Effects of Earthquakes, which I but now named,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The First Spe∣cies of Effects under the first</HI> Genus <HI>or Sort.</HI></NOTE>
was, that divers Parts of the Surface of the Earth which lay before, either be∣low
or level with the Sea, have been raised a good height above that Level
by Earthquakes. Of this <HI>Pliny</HI> gives us several Instances in the 85th Chap∣ter
of the 2d Book of his Natural History, <HI>Eadem nascentium Causa terrarum
est, cum idem ille Spiritus attollendo potens solo non valuit erumpere. Nascuntur

<P><HI>Meander,</HI> and <HI>Sandys</HI> also, in his Travels thro' <HI>Italy,</HI> and the Parts of the
<HI>Levant,</HI> gives this Instance, <HI>pag.</HI> 277. speaking of the new Mountain, which
was produced in the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> in the Year 1538. <HI>The Lake</HI> Lucri∣nus,
says he, <HI>extended formerly to</HI> Avernus, <HI>and so unto</HI> Gaurus, <HI>two other Lakes;
but is how no other than a little sedgy Plash, choaked up by the horrible and astonish∣ing
Eruption of the new Mountain, whereof, as oft as I think, I am apt to credit
whatsoever is wonderful. For who in</HI> Italy, says he, <HI>knows not, or who elsewhere
will believe, that a Mountam should arise partly out of a Lake, and partly out of the
Sea in one Day and a Night, to such a height, as to contend, in Altitude with the high
Mountains adjoining.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In the Year of our Lord 1538 on the 29th of</HI> September, <HI>when for certain Days
foregoing, the Country thereabouts was so vext with perpetual Earthquakes, as no
one House was le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t so intire, as not to expect immediate Ruine, after that the Sea
had retired 200 Paces from the Shore, leaving abundance of Fish with Springs of
Fresh Water rising at the bottom, this Mountain v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sibly ascended about the second
Hour of the Night,</HI> and so forwards. And again, <HI>pag.</HI> 281, speaking of the
same Place, he says, <HI>The Sea was accustomed, when urged with Storms to flow
in thro' the Lake,</HI> Luc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inus <HI>driving Fishes in with it; but now not only that Passage,
but a Part of</HI> Avernus <HI>it self is choaked by the Mountain.</HI> In which Histories I
take notice only of these two Particulars at present. First, That that Part
of the Land which lyes between <HI>Lucrinus</HI> and the Sea, that was oft-times be∣fore
overflowed by the Sea, since this Earthquake, has been so far raised, as
that now such Effects are no longer to be found. To confirm the rising of
which the more, the other Circumstance of the Sea's departing from the
Shore 200 Paces does much contribute. But not to insist on this, Mr. <HI>Chil∣dry</HI>
in his <HI>Britannia B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>conica,</HI> a Book very usesul in its Kind, being a Collection
of All the Natural History of the Islands of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to be met with in
<HI>Cambden,</HI> or <HI>Speed,</HI> and some other Historians, together with such of his own
as he had opportunity to observe, relates to us many considerable Passages to
this purpose. In his History of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> he saith, That near St. <HI>Benet</HI>'s in the
<HI>Holm,</HI> are perfect Cockles and Periwinkles sometimes digg'd up out of the
Earth, which makes some think it was formerly overflow'd by the Sea. The
Fenny Grounds also of <HI>Lincolnshire</HI> and <HI>Cheshire,</HI> seem to have proceeded from
the rising of the Ground; and those in <HI>Anglesy,</HI> where lopp'd Trees are now
dug up with the perfect Strokes of the Ax remaining on them, seem to have
<PB N="300" REF="277"/>
been first sunk under Water, then overturn'd and buried in their own Earth,
and afterwards the whole Earth seems to have been raised again to its for∣mer
height. Of the raising of the Surface of the Earth, by the overflowings
and stopping of Rivers and Waters, I shall afterwards speak.</P>
<P><HI>Linschoten</HI> gives us a Relation of the like Effects of an Earthquake that
hapned in the <HI>Terceras.</HI> The Relation, as I sind it epitomiz'd by <HI>Purchas</HI> in
The 1677 Page of the 4th Part of his <HI>Pilgrims,</HI> is this:, In <HI>July; Anno</HI> 1591.
“there happen'd an Earthquake in the Island of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> which lyeth from
<HI>Tercera</HI> South-East about 28 Miles, an Island 20 Miles long, and full of
Towns, which continued from <HI>July</HI> 26. to <HI>Aug.</HI> 12, in which time none durst
stay within his House, but fled into the Fields, fasting and praying with
great Sorrow, for that many of their Houses fell down, and a Town, called
<HI>Villa Franca,</HI> was almost razed to the Ground, all the Cloysters and Houses
shaken to the Earth, and therein People slain. <HI>The Land in some Places rose
up,</HI> and the Clifts removed from one Place to another, and some Hills were
defaced and made even with the Ground. The Earthquake was so strong,
that the Ships that lay in the Road, and in the Sea, shaked as if the World
would have turn'd round. There sprang also a Fountain out of the Earth,
from whence for the space of four Days there flow'd a most clear Water, and
after that it ceased. At the same time they heard such Thunder and Noise
under the Earth, as if all the Devils had been assembled together at that
Place, wherewith many dy'd for fear. The Island of <HI>Tercera</HI> shook four times
together, so tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it seem'd to turn about; but there happen'd no other Mis∣fortune
unto it. Earthquakes are common in those Islands: For about 20
Years past there happen'd another Earthquake, when a high Hill that lyeth
by the same Town <HI>Villa Franca,</HI> fell half down, and covered all the Town with
Earth, and killed many Men.” I have transcribed here once for all the whole
Relation, because there are many other considerable Circumstances in it be∣sides
the rising of the Earth, which I shall have occasion to refer to, under
others of the Heads or Propositions to be proved, and therefore shall not need
repetition. Two other Relations I find collected by <HI>Purchas,</HI> confirming this
and several of the other Propositions: The one is that of <HI>Dithmar Blefken's,</HI> in
his History of <HI>Island,</HI> Page 648 of the 3d Part of his <HI>Pilgrims.</HI> “On the 29th
of <HI>November</HI> about Midnight, in the Sea, there appear'd a Flame near <HI>Hecla,</HI>
which gave Light to the whole Island: An hour after the whole Island trem∣bled,
as it would have been moved out of the Place: After the Earthquake
follow'd a horrible Crack, that if all warlike Ordnance had been discharg'd
it had beta nothing to this Terror. It was known afterwards that <HI>the Sea
went back two Leagues in that Place, and remainend dry.”</HI></P>
<P>A Second History <HI>Purchas</HI> has collected out of the History of <HI>Joseph Acosta</HI>
of the <HI>West Indies,</HI> Page 940 of the 3d Part: omitting for the present divers
other Circumstances he takes notice of, I shall only mention that of the re∣ceding
of the Sea. “Upon the Coast of <HI>Chile,</HI> (says he) I remember not well
in what Year, there was so terrible an Earthquake, as it overturn'd whole
Mountains, and thereby stopt the Course of Rivers, which it converted into
Lakes: It beat down Towns, and slew a great number of People, causing the
Sea to leave her Place some Leagues, so as the Ships remain'd on dry Ground
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar from the ordinary Road, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>” An Example somewhat like this hap∣pen'd
lately in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> as I was inform'd by a Letter sent thence to
Mr. <HI>D.</HI> on <HI>London-Bridge.</HI> The thing in short was this: At a Place, about
7 Days Journey from <HI>Ducca,</HI> the Earth trembled about 32 Days; and the
Sequel was, that it raised the bottom of a Lake, so as to drive out all the
Water and Fish upon the Land, so that a Place which was formerly a Lake is
now dry Ground. This was written from <HI>Ballasore, Jan.</HI> 6. 1665. The Words
of the Letter I shall give afterwards.</P>
<P>The second Species of Effects of Earthquakes, is the raising of a conside∣rable
Part of the bottom of the Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Second Species under the first Head or Genus of the Effects of Earthquakes.</NOTE> and making it lye above the Surface of
the Water, by which means divers Islands have been generated. Of this

<HI>Vulcano</HI> is said to have first appear'd above Water about the time that <HI>Scipio
Africanus</HI> died. But we have much later Instances to confirm this our <HI>As∣sertion:</HI>
for about twenty eight Years since, an Island was made among the
<HI>Azores</HI> by an Eruption of Fire; of which divers have related the Story.
But <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Kircher</HI> in his <HI>Mundus Subterraneus,</HI> from the Relation of the Jesuits, has
added the most particular one. Having spoken of the exceeding height of
the Pike of <HI>Teneriff</HI> in the <HI>Canaries,</HI> and of the Eruptions of Fire in it, and
the hot Springs found about it, he adds, that in the Azores also there are
found places having almost the same Proprieties. The <HI>Pico de Fayal de Santo
Gregorio,</HI> being almost of equal hight, and St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s Island having here∣tofore
had several Vulcans, and having been troubled with many Earth∣quakes,
and very notably about thirty eight Years since, wherein all the
lsland was so terribly shaken, that the utter Ruin and Submersion of the
whole was feared. The History of which, in short, is this; “That <HI>June</HI> 26.
1638. the whole Island began to be shaken with Earthquakes for eight days,
so that the Inhabitants left Cities, Castles and Houses, and dwelt in the
Fields, but especially those of a Place call'd <HI>Vargen</HI> where the Motion was
more violent. After which Earthquake, this Prodigy followed; At a place of
the Sea, where Fisher-men us'd to fish in Summer, because of the great
abundance of Fish there caught, call'd <HI>La Femera,</HI> about <HI>6</HI> Miles from <HI>Pico
Delle Carmerine</HI> upon the first <HI>Sunday</HI> in <HI>July,</HI> a subterraneous Fire, notwith∣standing
the weight and depth of the Sea in that Place, which was 120 Foot,
as the Fishermen had often before that found by sounding, and the multi∣tude
of Waters which one would have thought sufficient to have quenched
the Fire: A subterraneous Fire, I say, broke out with a most unexpressible
violence, carrying up into the Clouds with it Water, Sand, Earth, Stones,
and other vast great bulks of Bodies; which to the sad Spectators, at a di∣stance,
appear'd like Flocks of Wool or Cotton, and falling back on the Sur∣face
of the Water look'd like Froth. The Space of this Eruption was about
as big as a Space of Land, that might well be sown by two Bushels of Grain.
By great Providence the Wind blew from the Land; otherwise the whole
Island would, in all probability, have perished by the merciless Rage of these
devouring Flames, such vast bulks of Stone were thrown up into the Air,
about the height to seeming of three Pikes Lengths, that one would rather
think them Mountains than Rocks. And which added further Horror to
this dreadful Sight, was, that these Mountains returning again, often met
with others ascending or being thrown up, and were thereby dasht into a
1000 Pieces; divers of which Pieces being afterwards taken up and bruised,
easily turn'd into a black shining Sand. Out of the great multitude and va∣riety
of these vast rejected Bodies, and the immense heaps of Rocks and Stones,
after a while was form'd a new Island out of the main Ocean, which at first
was not above 5 Furlongs over; but after a while, by daily accesses new
Matter, it increased after 14 Days to an Island of 5 Miles over. From this
Eruption, so great a quantity of Fish was destroy'd and thrown upon the next
adjoining Island, that 8 of the biggest <HI>Indian</HI> Galeons would not be suffici∣ent
to contain them; which the Inhabitants fearing, left the Stink of them
<PB N="302" REF="279"/>
might create a Plague, for, 18 Miles round collected and buried in deep Pits.
The Stink of the Brimstone was plainly smelt at 24 Miles distance. Thus
far he.” But we have one Instance more of the Generation of an Island out
of the bottom of the Sea, by an Eruption; which because it happen'd very
lately, namely in 1650, and near an Island in the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> which <HI>Pliny</HI>
relates to have been heretofore after the same manner produced, I shall in
short relate, as it is more largely recorded by <HI>Kircker,</HI> in his <HI>Mundus Subter∣raneus,</HI>
from the Mouth of Father <HI>Franciscus Riccardus,</HI> a Jesuit, who was at
the same time in the adjoining Island, and was an Eye-witness of all the
<HI>Phaenomena.</HI></P>
<P>“From the 24th of <HI>September</HI> to the 9th of <HI>October,</HI> 1650, the Island of <HI>San∣terinum</HI>
formerly call'd by <HI>Pliny Thera,</HI> was dreadfully shaken with Earth∣quakes,
so that the Inhabitants expected nothing but utter ruine; and were
yet more amazed by a horrid Eruption of Fire out of the bottom of the
Sea, about 4 Miles to the Eastward of the Island: Before which the Water
of the Place was rais'd above 30 Cubits perpendicularly, (I supppse he means
as to appearance from the Island, otherwise 'tis but very little) which
Wave spreading it self round every way, overturn'd every thing it met, de∣stroying
Ships and Galleys in the Harbour of <HI>Candle,</HI> which was four score
Miles distant. The Eruption fill'd the Air with Ashes and horrible sul∣phureous
Stinks, and dreadful Lightnings and Thunders succeeded. All
things in the Island were covered with a yellow sulphureous Crust, and the
People almost blinded as well as choak'd. Multitudes of Pumice, and other
Stones were thrown up, and carried as far as <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and to Places
at a very great distance. The Force of this Eruption was greatest the
two first Months, when all the Neighbouring Sea seem'd to boil, and the
<HI>Vulcan</HI> continually vomited up Fire-balls. Upon the turning of the Wind,
great Mischief was done in the Island of <HI>Santerinum,</HI> many Beasts and Birds
were kill'd: And on the 29th of <HI>October,</HI> and 4th of <HI>November,</HI> about 50
Men were kill'd by it. The other four Months it lasted, tho' much abated
of its former Fierceness, yet it still cast up Stone, and seem'd to en∣deavour
the making of a New Island, which though it do not yet perfectly
appear above Water, yet 'tis cover'd but 8 Foot by the Water; and the
bubbling of the Water seems to speak another Eruption, that may in time
finish Nature's Birth.” And in the Year he writ this, which he says was
1656, there was an extraordinary boiling of the Sea, and an Eruption of
Smoke. And though our Natural Historians have been very scarce in the
World, and consequently such Histories are very few; yet there has been no
Age wherein such Historians have liv'd, but has afforded them an Example
of such Effects of Earthquakes. And I doubt not, but had the World been
always furnisht with such Historians as had been inquisitive and knowing, we
should have sound not only <HI>Thera</HI> or <HI>Santerinum,</HI> and <HI>Valcano</HI> and <HI>Delos,</HI> and
that in the <HI>Azores,</HI> and one lately in the <HI>Canaries,</HI> but a very great part of the
Islands of the whole World to have been rais'd out of the Sea, or separated
from the Land by Earthquakes: for which Opinion I shall afterwards relate
several Observations both of my own and others, which seem to afford pro∣bable
Arguments.</P>
<P>But to proceed to the third Kind or Species of Effects produced by Earth∣quakes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third Species under the first <HI>Genus</HI> of Effects.</NOTE>
which is the raising very considerable Mountains out of Plains. Of
this I shall add a few Instances; but none more notable, than that of the new
Mountain near <HI>Naples,</HI> which I said somewhat before out of <HI>Sandys</HI>'s Travels.
In the Year 1538. <HI>Sep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emb.</HI> 29. this Mountain visibly ascended about the 2d
hour of the Night, with a hideous roaring, horribly vomiting Stones, and
such store of Cinders, as overwhelm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'d all the Buildings there about, and the
salubrious Baths of <HI>Tripergula,</HI> for so many Ages celebrated, consuming all
the Vines to Ashes, and killing Birds and Beasts, and frighting away all the
Inhabitants, who fled naked and de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iled through the dark: And has advanced
its top a Mile above the Basis: the Stones of it are so light and pory, that
they will not sink when thrown in the Sea. This new Mountain, when new
rais'd, had a number of Issues, at some of them smoking, and sometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lamm∣ing;
<PB N="303" REF="280"/>
at others disgorging Rivulets of hot Water, keeping within a terrible
rumbling; and many perished that ventured to descend into the hollowness
above. But that hollow at the top is at present an Orchard, and the Mountain
throughout bereft of its Terrors. “It is reported, saith <HI>Childrey,</HI> that in a
Parish by the Sea-side, not far from <HI>Axbridge</HI> in <HI>Somer se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shire,</HI> within these 50
Years, a Parcel of Land swell'd up like a Hill; but on a sudden clave asun∣der,
and fell down into he Earth, and in the place of it remains a great
Pool.” Our English Chronicles say, at <HI>Oxe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hal,</HI> in the Bisnoprick of <HI>Dur∣ham,</HI>
on <HI>Christmas</HI> Day 1679, the Ground heav'd up aloft like a Tower, and
continued all that day immoveable, till Evening, and then fell with a horri∣ble
noise, sinking into the Earth, and leaving three deep Pits, call'd Hell∣Kettles.
<HI>Varenius</HI> tells us of a new Mountain likewise raised in <HI>Java,</HI> in the
Year 1586, with the like Effects of those I formerly named of the new Moun∣tain
first shaking the Earth, then heaving up and throwing up into the Air
the upper Parts of the Earth, afterwards the Rock and inner Parts, then fiery
Coals and Cinders, overwhelming the circumjacent Fields and Towns, and
killing above 10000 Men, and burning what was not overwhelmed. I have
not time to reckon up the multitude of Instances I have met with in Authors,
such as <HI>Aetna</HI> in <HI>Sicily, Vesuvius</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> one in <HI>Croatia,</HI> near the City <HI>Valonia,</HI>
the <HI>Pike</HI> in <HI>Tenarif,</HI> and the <HI>Pike</HI> in the <HI>Azores, Hecla, Helga,</HI> and another in
<HI>Island:</HI> The Mount <HI>Gonnapi</HI> in one of the Islands of <HI>Banda,</HI> which made
an horrid Eruption at the same time with that in <HI>Java:</HI> The Mount <HI>Bala∣vane</HI>
in <HI>Sumatra:</HI> Others in the <HI>Molucca</HI> Islands, in <HI>China, Japan,</HI> and the <HI>Phi∣lippines,</HI>
and in some of the <HI>Maurician</HI> Islands, and several other Parts of the
<HI>East Indies.</HI> In the <HI>West Indies</HI> also we have multitudes of Examples, several
in <HI>Nicaragua,</HI> and all along the Ledge of Mountains in <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Chile,</HI> and
in <HI>New Spain</HI> and <HI>Mexico.</HI> In the Islands of <HI>Papoys,</HI> discover'd by <HI>Le Mair,</HI>
joining to the South Continent in <HI>Mar Del Zur:</HI> All which are as so many
shining Torches to direct us in the search after this Truth. There are many
other Instances of Mountains, that have but lately as it were left to burn,
and are cover'd with Wood and grown fruitful. So the new Mountain I for∣merly
mention'd, has an Orchard growing where the Fire at first <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lamed.
Another in the Island <HI>Qutimeda,</HI> near the River <HI>Plat</HI> in <HI>Brasill;</HI> The Islands
also of St. <HI>Helena,</HI> and <HI>Ascension,</HI> discovered by the great plenty of Cinders,
and the Fashions of the Hills to have formerly contained <HI>Vulcanoes,</HI> and pro∣bably
were at first made by some subterraneous Eruption, as indeed most of
those Islands in the main Ocean; such as the <HI>Canaries,</HI> and the <HI>Azores,</HI> and
the <HI>East Indian,</HI> and the <HI>Cariby</HI> Islands and divers others seem to have been.
A Passage, to make this Assertion somewhat more probable, I have met with
in <HI>Linschoten</HI>'s Description of the Island of <HI>Tercera,</HI> which as <HI>Purchas</HI> has epi∣tomized
I have here added. Pag. 1670. of the 4th Part of his Pilgrims the
saith, speaking of the Island of <HI>Tercera</HI>) “The Land is very high, and as it
seemeth hollow, for that as they pass over an Hill of Stone, the Ground
soundeth under them as if it were a Cellar. So that it seems in divers Pla∣ces
to have holes under the Earth, whereby it is much subject to Earth∣quakes,
as also all the other Islands are, for there it is a common thing:
and all those Islands, for the most part, have had Mines of Brimstone; for
that in many Places of <HI>Tercera</HI> and St. <HI>Michael,</HI> the Smoke and Savour of
Brimstone doth still issue out of the Ground, and the Country round about
is all singed and burnt. Also there are Places wherein there are Wells,
the Water whereof is so hot that it will boil an Egg, as if it were over a
Fire. Besides which, the shape of the Hills, and several other Circumstan∣ces
mention'd in <HI>Linschoten,</HI> do make it probable that those have been all
<HI>Vulcano's.</HI>”</P>
<P>But to proceed to the Fourth Species of Effects of Earthquakes under this
Head; and that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fourth Species under the first <HI>Genus</HI> of Effects.</NOTE> the raising of the Parts of the Earth by the throwing on
a great access of new Earth: Of this I have already given many Instances in
the newly mentioned Histories of Eruptions, where I mentioned the over∣whelming
of Fields, Towns, and Woods, and the like, by Materials thrown
out by these Eruptions. I shall only add one Instance or two more to confirm
<PB N="304" REF="281"/>
this Head, and then proceed. The first is that mentioned by <HI>Olaus Wormius,</HI>
in the 5th Chapter of the 1st Section of the 1st Book of his <HI>Musaeum,</HI> wherein
he gives an Account of an extraordinary Earthquake in <HI>Iceland,</HI> which fill'd
the Air with Dust, Earth, and Cinders, and overwhelmed Towns, Fields and
even Ships a good way distant on the Sea; and which sent sorth its Fumes
with such violence and Plenty, as covered all the Decks and Sails of Ships
lying on the Coast of <HI>Norway,</HI> some hundred Leagues distant. His Words
are Page the 18th thus, <HI>Alterum portentosae Terrae genus,</HI> &amp;c. And to make
this or <HI>Wormius</HI> the more probable, I have now by me a Paper of Dust, which
was rained out of the Air upon a Ship lying at <HI>Algier</HI> upon the Coast of <HI>Bar∣bary,</HI>
upon a great Eruption of <HI>Vesuvius</HI> in the Year 16—The Relation of
which, as 1 received it together with the Paper of Dust from that eminent
Virtuoso, <HI>John Evelyn,</HI> Es{que} I shall here annex.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This was o∣mitted by the Author.</NOTE> But which is beyond all, is
the late Eruption of <HI>Mongibell</HI> of <HI>Aetna.</HI></P>
<P>And to confirm this Proposition yet further, I cannot pass by a very remar∣kable
Rain of Earth and Ashes, that happen'd in <HI>Peru, Anno</HI> 1600, men∣tioned
by <HI>Garcilasso De la Vega,</HI> one of the Off-spring of the <HI>Incas of Peru,</HI> in
his History of <HI>America.</HI> The Epitome of which by <HI>Purchas,</HI> is this, pag. 1476
of the 4th Part of his <HI>Pilgrims.</HI> “I might add, says he, the great Earth∣quakes,
<HI>An.</HI> 1600, in <HI>Peru</HI> at <HI>Arequepa,</HI> the raining of Sand, as also of
Ashes, about 20 days from a <HI>Vulcan</HI> breaking forth: The Ashes falling in
Places above a Yard thick, in some Places more than two, and where least
above a quarter of a Yard, which buried the Corn-grounds of Maize and
Wheat, and the Boughs of Trees were broken and fruitless, and the Cattel
great and small dy'd for want of Pasture. for the Sand which rained covered
the Fields 30 Leagues one way, and above 40 Leagues another way, round
about <HI>Arequepa,</HI> they found their Kine dead by 500 together in several Herds,
and whole Flocks of Sheep, and Herds of Goats and Swine buried. Hou∣ses
fell with the weight of the Sand; others cost much Industry to save them;
mighty Thunders and Lightning were heard and seen 30 Leagues about <HI>A∣requepa.</HI>
It was so dark whilst those Showers lasted, that at mid-day they
burned Candles to see to do business.”—I could add divers other Instances
to confirm this Proposition; but these may at present suffice.</P>
<P>But this is but one way by which divers things have been buried: there is
another way which I can only at present mention, and must refer the Proba∣tion
and Prosecution to some other occasion; and that is, that very many
of the lower superficial Parts of the Earth, have been and continually are
covered and buried by the access of Matter, tumbled and washed down by
Excesses of Wind and Rain, and by the continual sweepings of Rivers and
Streams of Water. Under this Head, I shall shew several Places and Coun∣tries
in the World, that are nothing else but the Productions of these Causes.
To this purpose, <HI>Peter de la Valle</HI> gives some Observations which he made in
<HI>Egypt,</HI> in the 11th Letter dated from <HI>Grand Caire, Jan.</HI> 25. 1616. “of the
former seven Mouths of <HI>Nile</HI> (says he) there are only four left, and of
those but two Navigable; the rest are either fill'd, or run no more, or are
small Streams not taken notice of, or only Torrents in the time of great
Rains; but I could learn nothing of them, because the great Expence of
the Ancients for cleansing the Ditches, has been intermitted for several
hundreds of Years.” He is likewise of Opinion with <HI>Herodotus,</HI> that the
<HI>Delta,</HI> and all the Lower <HI>Egypt,</HI> where the <HI>Greeks</HI> navigated in his time, was
in the first Ages of the World made by the Sand and Mud of <HI>Nile.</HI></P>
<P>All which Histories and Particulars do manifestly enough evince, that there
have been in very many Parts of the World considerable Mutations of the
superficial Parts, since the beginning; and that therefore those Places where
these figured petrify'd Bodies are found; though they now seem never so much
foreign, and differing from the likely native Places of such animated Bodies,
may notwithstanding heretofore have been in such another kind of condition,
as was most sutable to the breeding and nourishing of them: Which I shall
yet further manifest, by comparing the other Effects produced by Earth∣quakes;
such as the sinking, and burying, and transposing, and overturning
of the superficial Parts of the Earth.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="282"/>
Another Sort of Effects, is the sinking of the superficial Parts of the Earth,
and placing them below their former Position,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second sort or General Head of Ef∣fects of Earth∣quakes.</NOTE> both in respect of some Parts
newly raised, and in respect of some other adjacent Parts not displaced. And
this seems to be caus'd by the subsiding or sinking of those Parts into such Ca∣verns,
as by the strength of the Eruption passing below before it breaks out
are made underneath: For so great is the Violence of these subterraneous Fires,
that nothing almost is able to resist their Power of expanding; but spreading
themselves, and rushing that way which is most easy, they carry along be∣fore
them Earth, Sand, and Rocks, and Mountains, and whatever lies in
their way, and raise the superficial Parts of the Earth whilst they pass under∣neath.
And if the Parts of the Earth underneath are so loose or obnoxious
to the Force of the Fire, as to be dislodged, unless the remaining Parts are
very strong and constitute a very firm Stony Arch, the Earth does easily tum∣ble
into the Holes and Hollows made by the Fire. Now it cannot be ima∣gin'd
but that all those vast Congeries of Earth, which I have already mention'd
to have been thrown up, and to create new Islands and new Mountains, and
the like, must leave vast Caverns below them, to be fill'd either with the
Parts of the Earth that hang immediately over them, or with the Sea, or o∣ther
subterraneous Waters, if the Roofs of these Cavities be strong enough to
sustain the Earth above them from sinking. And some such Power as these
subterraneous Fires, seems to me to have been the Cause of the strange Posi∣tions
and Intermixture of the Veins of Ores and Minerals in the Bowels of the
Mountains, where, for the most part, they are now found; and even of
bringing those Substances so near the Surface of the Earth, which, from the
Consideration of very many Circumstances, seem to me to be naturally situa∣ted
at a much greater Depth below within the Bowels of this Globe. And
hence may be rendred a Reason of the Figures of these Minerals, and other
Substances mix'd with them, and of the compounding and blending of several
of those Substances together, whereby some of them are very strangely uni∣ted
and alter'd. But this I mention only by the Bye, and shall not insist on
it, belonging more properly to another Head. To proceed then under this
General Head, are comprised several Kinds of Effects, differing only ac∣cording
to the Parts of the Earth they have been wrought upon.</P>
<P>The first is, The sinking of several Inland Parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Spe∣cies of those Effects, under the second gene∣ral Head or <HI>Ge∣nus</HI> of Earth∣quakes.</NOTE> which were before emi∣nent,
and laying them much lower into Vales. Sometimes, the sinking of a
Part of the Earth to a very great Depth; and leaving behind, instead of a
Firm Ground, a Lake of Salt or Sea-water. Of these we have several In∣stances
in Natural Historians. And, to pass by many others, I shall only
mention such as have lately happen'd. Of this kind Mr. <HI>Childrey,</HI> in his <HI>Bri∣tannia
Baconica,</HI> has collected several Instances; two out of our English Chro∣nicle.
His Relations are these, <HI>Pag. 62. “August</HI> the 4th, 1585. after a ve∣ry
violent Storm of Thunder and Rain, at <HI>Nottingham</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> Eight miles
from <HI>London,</HI> the Ground suddenly began to sink; and Three great Elms
growing upon it, were carried so deep into the Earth, that no Part of them
could any more be seen. The Hole left (saith the Story) is in Compass 80

many Miles from <HI>Nottingham)</HI> a Part of an Hedge of Ashes, 12 Perches
long, were sunk 6 Foot and an half deep; the next morning 15 Foot more;
the third morning 80 Foot more at least, and so daily. (And presently af∣ter,
he says) Moreover, in one Part of the Plain Field, there is a great Hole
made by sinking of the Earth, to the Depth of 30 Foot at least, being in
Breadth in some Places 2 Perches over, and in Length 5 or 6 Perches▪
There are sundry other Sinkings in divers other Places, one of 60 Foot, a∣nother
of 47, and another of 34 Foot; by means of which Confusion it is
come to pass, that where the highest Hills were, there be the lowest Dales,
and the lowest Dales are become the highest Grounds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>”</P>
<P>And again, <HI>Pag.</HI> 131. he gives an Instance, upon his own Knowledge, much
to the same purpose, which lately happen'd; namely, “<HI>July</HI> the 8th 1657.
<PB N="306" REF="283"/>
about 3 of the Clock, in the Parish of <HI>Bickly,</HI> was heard a very great Noise
like Thunder afar off; which was much wonder'd at, because the Sky was
clear, and no Appearance of a Cloud. Shortly after (saith the Author of
this Relation) a Neighbour came to me, and told me, I should see a very
strange thing if I would go with him. So coming into a Field, called the
<HI>Lay-field,</HI> we found a very great Bank of Earth, which had many tall Oaks
growing on it, quite sunk into the Ground Trees and all. At first we durst
not go near it, because the Earth, for near 20 Yards about, was exceeding∣ly
much rent, and seem'd ready to fall: But since that time, my self and
some others have ventured to see the bottom, I mean to go to the Brink, so
as to discern the visible Bottom, which is Water, and conceived to be about
30 Yards from us; under which is sunk all the Earth about it, for 16 Yards
round at least, 3 tall Oaks, a very tall Awber, and certain other small
Trees, and not a Sprig of them to be seen above Water. 4 or 5 Oaks
more are expected to fall every moment, and a great Quantity of Land is
like to fall, indeed never ceasing more or less; and when any considerable
Clod falls, it is much like the Report of a Cannon. We can discern the
Ground hollow above the Water a great Depth; but how far hollow or how
deep, is not to be found out by Man. Some of the Water, (as I have been
told) drawn out of this Pit with a Bucket, was found to be as falt as Sea∣water,
<HI>&amp;c.”</HI></P>
<P>A considerable Circumstance also to confirm this Proposition, is a Passage
in that History I have mention'd out of <HI>Linschoten,</HI> of the Island of <HI>Tercera;</HI>
where he says [<HI>and some Hills were defaced, and made even with the Ground.]</HI></P>
<P><HI>Kircher</HI> in the Preface to his <HI>Mundus Subterraneus,</HI> Chap. 2. tells us a very
remarkable History of the sinking of a Town, and the Land about it, and the
Generation of a Lake instead of it. <HI>Contigit</HI> (says he) <HI>hac eadem hora res aeter∣na

“At this very time happened a thing worthy never to be forgotten, <HI>viz.</HI> the
Subversion of the most famous Town, call'd St. <HI>Euphemia:</HI> 'twas situated at
the side of the Bay under the Jurisdiction of the Knights of <HI>Malta.</HI> When
therefore we had come to <HI>Lopiz,</HI> almost dead from the vehement shak∣ing
of the Earth, and lying prostrate on the Ground, at last the <HI>Paroxysm</HI>
of Nature remitting, casting our Eyes towards the Neighbouring Places,
we saw the forementioned Town encompassed with a great, wonderful, and
unusual Cloud, which was seen by us three times, especially at Three-a-clock
in the Afternoon, the Heavens being clear. This Cloud being, by degrees,
dissipated, we look'd for the Town, but found it not, a stinking Lake (to
our wonder) appearing in the Place of it. We sought for some Person or
other, to give us some certain Account of this unusual Event; but could
not find one to tell any News of this dreadful Accident and great Destru∣ction,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> We prosecuting our Journey, passing by <HI>Nicastrum, Amantea,
Paula,</HI> and <HI>Belvedere,</HI> found nothing for 200 Miles, but the remaining Car∣casses
of Cities and Castles, and horrid Destructions, the Men lying in
the open Fields, and, as it were, dead and withered through Fear and
Terror.”</P>
<P>To this purpose, give me leave to adjoin an Extract of a Letter, sent from
<HI>Balasore</HI> in the <HI>East Indies, Jan.</HI> 6. 1665. “The same Star appeared in our
Horizon, about the same time 'twas seen with you. The Effects in part
<PB N="307" REF="284"/>
have already been felt here by unseasonable Weather, great Mortalities a∣mongst
the Natives, <HI>English,</HI> and others. We have had several Earth∣quakes
unusual here, which, with hideous Noises, have in several Places
broke out and swallow'd up Houses and Towns. But about 7 Days Journey
from <HI>Ducca,</HI> where were at that time 3 or 4 <HI>Dutch,</HI> they and the Natives
relate, That in the Market-Place the Earth trembled about 32 Days and
Nights, without Intermission. At the latter end, in the Market-place, the
Ground turn'd round as Dust in a Whirlwind, and so continued several
Days and Nights, and swallow'd up several Men who were Spectators, who
sunk and turned round with the Earth, as in a Quagmire. At last, the
Earth worked and cast up a great Fish bigger than hath been seen in this
Country, which the People caught: But the Conclusion of all was, that the
Earth sunk with 300 Houses, and all the Men, where now appears a large
Lake some Fathoms deep. About a Mile from this Town was a Lake full
of Fish, which in these 32 Days of the Earthquake cast up all her Fish on
dry Land, where might have been gather'd many, which had run out of the
Water upon dry Land, and there died: But when the other great Lake ap∣peared,
this former dried up, and is now firm Land.”</P>
<P>To the same purpose also we have several other Instances, some later and
some nearer home. “Near <HI>Darlington,</HI> (says <HI>Childrey,</HI> in his <HI>Britannia Baconi∣ca,</HI>
speaking of the Rarities of the Bishoprick of <HI>Durham)</HI> are three Pits,
whose Waters are warm (hot, says <HI>Cambden)</HI> wonderful deep, call'd Hell-Kettles.
These are thought to come of an Earthquake, that happen'd
<HI>Anno</HI> 1179. For on <HI>Christmas</HI> Day, says our Chronicles, at <HI>Oxenhall,</HI> which
is this Place, the Ground heaved up aloft like a Tower, and so continued
all that Day, as it were immovable, till Evening, and then fell in with a
very horrible Noise, and the Earth swallow'd it up, and made in the same
Place 3 deep Pits. The same in the Section of <HI>Brecknock,</HI> says, 'Two Miles
East from <HI>Brecknock,</HI> is a Meer, called <HI>Llinsavathan,</HI> which (as the People
dwelling there, say,) was once a City; but the City was swallowed up by
an Earthquake, and this Water or Lake succeeded in the Place: The Lake
is encompassed with high steep Hills, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—-”</P>
<P>“Near <HI>Falkirk,</HI> saith <HI>Lithgow,</HI> remains the Ruines and Marks of a Town,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> swallowed up into the Earth by an Earthquake, and the void Place is
fill'd with Water.”—-<HI>Pliny</HI> also, in the 88th Chap. of his 2d Book of Nat.
Hist. records a like Instance. <HI>Mox &amp; in his Montem Epopon cum repente flam∣ma
ex eo emicuisset campestri aequatum planitie. In eadem &amp; oppidum haustum pro∣fundo
alio{que} motu Terrae Stagnum emersisse. Et alio provolutis Montibus insulam
extitisse Prochytam, &amp;c.</HI> “Presently the Mountain <HI>Epopon</HI> (when suddenly a
Flame had shon out of it) was levelled with the Plain; and in the same
Plain a Town was swallow'd up into the Deep, and by another Motion of
the Earth became a Lake. And in another Place, the Mountain being
tumbled down, the Island <HI>Prochyta</HI> arose, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>”</P>
<P>The Dead Sea also in <HI>Palestine,</HI> was the Production of a most terrible Earth∣quake,
and a Fire sent from Heaven: for, methinks, the Relation of the sad
Catastrophe of those Four Cities, <HI>Sodom, Gomorrha, Zeboim</HI> and <HI>Adma,</HI> mention∣ed
in Scripture, seem somewhat like that I have newly related out of <HI>Kircher</HI> of
St. <HI>Euphemia.</HI> There are a multitude of other Instances which I could bring
on this Head, of the sinking of Mountains and Hills into Plains, and all these
into Lakes: Of which <HI>Pliny</HI> gives several Instances, in the 90, 91, and 92 Chap.
of his Second Book. The <HI>Pico</HI> in the <HI>Moluccas,</HI> accounted of equal Height
with that of <HI>Tenariff,</HI> was by a late Earthquake quite swallow'd into the
Earth, and Ieft a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake in its Place. <HI>Vesuvius</HI> and <HI>Strongylus,</HI> are by late
Earthquakes reduced to almost half their former Height. Many of those vast
Mountains of the <HI>Andes</HI> in <HI>Chile,</HI> were by an Earthquake, <HI>An.</HI> 164 6. quite
swallow'd up and lost, as <HI>Kircher</HI> relates. I could add many Histories of the
fatal Catastrophe's of many Towns, and other Places of Note; but these, I
hope, may suffice to shew this kind also of Mutation in the superficial Parts of
the Earth, to be effected by Earthquakes.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="285"/>
Nor does Earthquakes only sink Mountains and Inland Parts; but such
Parts also as are near to,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second Spe∣cies of those Effects under the second Ge∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eral.</NOTE> equal with, and under the Surface of the Sea. Of
this we have Instances near home, of <HI>Winchelsea</HI> and of the <HI>Goodwin-Lands,</HI>
and of the Towns in <HI>Freezland,</HI> that have been about 400 Years since swal∣low'd
up by the Sea; and nothing but some Towers, and the <HI>Goodwin-Sands,</HI>
are now to be found of them. The like happen'd to several Parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
as <HI>Hector Boethius</HI> relates. <HI>Linschoten,</HI> in his History of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> re∣lates
among many other Histories of the Effects of Earthquakes, this conside∣rable
Passage. “Since, in the Year 1586. in the Month of <HI>July,</HI> fell another
Earthquake in the City of <HI>Kings,</HI> the which, as the Vice-Roy did write,
had run 170 Leagues along the Coast, and athwart in the <HI>Sierra</HI> 50 Leagues.
It ruin'd a great Part of the City. It caus'd the like Trouble and Motion
of the Sea, as it had done at <HI>Chile,</HI> which happen'd presently after the
Earthquake; so as they might see the Sea to fly furiously out of her Bounds,
and to run near 2 Leagues into the Land, rising above 14 Fathom. It co∣ver'd
all the Plain, so as the Ditches were filled and Pieces of Wood that were
here, swam in the Water.” There are multitudes of Instances of the like Effects
in several other Parts of the World, which have been wrought by Earth∣quakes,
which may be found in Natural Historians; which, for Brevity-sake,
I omit, they serving only to prove a Proposition, which, i suppose, will be
granted by any that have either seen or heard of the Effects of Earthquakes.</P>
<P>Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third Spe∣cies of Effects under the se∣cond General.</NOTE> though I find <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> general Deficiency in Natural Historians, of Instan∣ces
to prove that the submarine Parts have likewise suffer'd the like Effects of
sinking, they lying out of View, and so cannot without some Trouble and
Diligence be observed; yet if we consider from how great a Depth these E∣ruptions
proceed, and how little Distinction they make between Mountains
and Plains, as to the weight of removing, we may easily believe, that the
Bottom of the Sea is as subject to these Mutations, as the Parts of the Land.
And since, by the former Relations, we have many Instances of the raising
of the Bottom of the Sea, 'tis very probable that what Quantity of Matter
is thrown to and raised in one Place, is sunk and falls into that Cavity left
by another. An Island cannot be raised in one Place, without leaving an
Abyss in another. And I do not doubt, but there have been as many Earth∣quakes
in the Parts of the Earth under the Ocean, as there have been
in the Parts of the Dry Land: But being, for the most part, till of late un∣frequented
by Mankind, and even now but very thinly, 'tis almost a 1000 to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that what happen are never seen; and a 100 to 1, if they have been seen,
whether they be recorded: For how few Writers are there of Natural
History? There is somewhat of Probability in the Story related by <HI>Plato,</HI>
in his <HI>Timaeus,</HI> of the Island <HI>Atlantis</HI> in the <HI>Atlantick,</HI> Ocean, which he
says was swallow'd up by an Earthquake into the Sea. And 'tis not unlike∣ly,
but that most of those Islands that are now appearing, have been either
thrown up out of the Sea by Eruptions, such as the <HI>Canaries, Azores,</HI> St. <HI>He∣lena,
&amp;c.</HI> which the Form of them, and the Vulcanes in them, and the Cin∣ders
and Pumice-stones found about them, and the frequent Earthquakes they
are troubled with, and the remaining Hills of extinguish'd Vulcanes, do all strong∣ly
argue for: Or else, that they are some of them at least some Relicts of that Great
Island which is now not to be found; and yet we have no Records hereof. That
there is as great Inequality in the Depth of the Sea, as there is in the Height
of the Land, the Observations of Seamen, experimented by their Sounding
Lines, do sufficiently inform us: For Hills, we have deep Holes; and for
Mountains and Pikes, Abysses and Malstroons: And that these must have in
all Ages been filling with Parts of the Earth, tumbled by the Motion of the
Waters, and rowling to the lowest Place, is very probable; and so they
would in time have been fill'd up, had not Earthquakes, by their Eruptions
and Tumblings, created new Irregularities. And therefore that there are
still such Places, is an Argument, that there have been of later Ages Earth∣quakes
in some of them. Of these I shall mention one or two Instances, which
I meet with in Voyages, and Relations of Travellers.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="286"/>
In the Relation of the Circum-navigation of Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> speaking of
the Straights of <HI>Magellane,</HI> he says, Pag. 35, “They saw an Island with a very,
high <HI>Vulcano;”</HI> and the next Page, he says, “They, had need to have carry'd no∣thing
but Anchors and Cables, to find, Ground, the Sea was so very deep:
Which Depth is explain'd more express,” Pag. 42. where 'tis said, “Being
driven from our first Place of anchoring, so unmeasurable was the Depth,
that 500 Fathoms would fetch no Ground.” And in Page 99. of the same
Relation, the Author tells, how their Ship truck upon a Rock, which
Page 102. he says, at low Water was but 6 Foot under Water, and just by it
no Bottom to be found, by reason of the great Depth.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Ric<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut,</HI> in a Letter of his to the Royal Society, dated from <HI>Constantino∣ple,
Nov.</HI> 1667, says, “That the Water runs out of the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea into the <HI>Pro∣pontis</HI>
with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wonderful swiftness, which is more wonderful in regard of the
depth of the <HI>Bosphorus</HI> being in the Channel fifty or fifty five Fathom Wa∣ter,
and along the Land in most places the Ships may lye on the Shore with
their Heads, and yet have twenty Fathom Water at their Sterns.”</P>
<P>Besides these effects of raising and sinking the parts of the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third Ge∣neral Head or the third sort of effects of Earth∣quakes.</NOTE> there is
a third sort, which is the transposing, converting, subverting and jumbling
the parts of the Earth together overthrowing Mountains, and turning;
them upsidedown, throwing the parts of the Earth from one place to another,
burying the superficial parts, and raising the Subterraneous. Of these kinds
of changes there are many instances in the former Relations I have mention'd,
as particularly that of <HI>Linschoten</HI> of the Earthquake in the <HI>Terceras,</HI> and that
of <HI>Josephus Acosta,</HI> of the Earthquake upon the Coast of <HI>Chile.</HI> And there are a
multitude of others I could here set down, but I shall only mention some of
them. “Soon after, (says <HI>Josephus Acosta,</HI> in the same place I mentioned be∣fore)
which was in the Year 1582,” happened that Earthquake of <HI>Arequipa,</HI>
which in a manner overthrew the whole City. And a little before in the same
place, he tells of a terrible Earthquake in <HI>Guatimala,</HI> in the Year 1586,
which overthrew almost all the City, and that the Vulcan for above six Months
together continually vomited a Flood of Fire from the top of it. And a lit∣tle
after, the same Author, in the same place, says, “In the Year of our Lord
1581, in <HI>Cugiano,</HI> a City of <HI>Peru,</HI> otherwise call'd the <HI>Pear,</HI> there happen'd
a strange accident touching this Subject; a Village call' d <HI>Angoango</HI> (where
many <HI>Indians</HI> dwelt that were Socerers and Idolaters) fell sudenly to ruine,
so as a great part thereof was raised up and carried away, and many of the
<HI>Indians</HI> smothered; and that which seems incredible (yet testified by Men
of Credit) the Earth that was ruined and so beaten down, did run and slide
upon the Land for the space of a League and a half, as it had been Water or
Wax melted, so as it stopt and filld up a Lake, and remain'd so spread all
over the whole Country.”</P>
<P>Nor are there wanting Examples of this kind even in this Island▪ Mr. <HI>Chil∣drey</HI>
in his <HI>Britannia Baconica</HI> has collected several out of <HI>Cambden;</HI> as that in
<HI>Herefordshire.</HI> “Where, in the Year 1571, <HI>Marcley</HI> Hill in the East part of
the Shire, with a roaring noise, remov'd itself from the place where it stood,
and for three Days together travell'd from its old Seat. It began first to
take its Journey <HI>Feb.</HI> 17. being <HI>Saturday,</HI> at six of the Clock at Night, and
by seven the next Morning it had gone forty Paces, carrying with it Sheep
in their Cotes, Hedge-Rows, and Trees, whereof some were overturn'd,
and some that stood upon the Plain, are firmly growing upon the Hill;
those that were East were turned West, and those in the West were set in
the East; in this remove it overthrew <HI>Kinaston</HI> Chappel, and turn'd two
High-ways near a hundred Yards from their old Paths. The Ground that
they remov'd was about twenty <HI>six</HI> Acres, which opening itself with Rocks
and all bore the Earth before it for four hundred Yards space, without any
stay, leaving Pasturage in places of the Tillage, and the Tillage overspread
with Pasturage. Lastly, overwhelming its lower parts, it mounted to a
Hill of twelve Fathoms high, and there rested after three Days travel.”</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="287"/>
“<HI>At Hermitage</HI> in <HI>Dorsetshire,</HI> says <HI>Stow</HI> in his Summary, <HI>January</HI> the third
1582, a piece of Ground of three Acres remov'd from its old place, and was
carried over another Close where Alders and Willows grew, the space of
forty Rods or Pearches, and stopt up the high-Way that led to <HI>Cerne,</HI> a
Market-Town, and yet the Hedges that it was inclosed with enclose it
still, and the Trees stand bolt upright, and the place where this Ground
was is left like a great Pit.” And 'tis not a little observable, that at the
same time that these changes happened in <HI>America,</HI> the like also happened in
<HI>England,</HI> of which I shall hereafter give divers other Instances, and shall also
deduce Corrolarys, that may otherwise seem very strange, and yet I question
not to prove the truth of them. <HI>Maximus</HI> (says <HI>Pliny,</HI> Cap. 48. Lib. 2. Hist. Nat.)

of swallowing some Rivers, and of producing others a new w of changing
Countries from Barren to Fruitful, and from Fruitful to Barren; of making

There are other Relations that mention the vast spaces of Ground

I English. thus. “All things are subject to the same chance; tho' they are
not yet moved, they are movable; for we err, if we believe any part of
the Earth excused and free from this hazzard; all are subject to the same
Law; nothing is made by Nature so fixt as to be unmoveable; some sink at
one time, some at another: And as in great Cities, now this House, now
that House hangs tottering on Props; so on the great Face of the Earth,
now this part fails, now that: <HI>Tyre</HI> formerly was remarkable for its De∣struction:
<HI>Asia</HI> lost at once Twelve Cities. Whatever the Power may be,
the former Year <HI>Achaia</HI> and <HI>Macedonia</HI> felt It now <HI>Campania:</HI> Fate goes
round, and repeates what it had long before acted: It brings some things
often on the Stage, some seldom; but suffers nothing absolutely free and
untouch'd. Not we Men only are brought forth short Liv'd, frail Beings:
Cities, Countries, Shores, nay the Sea itself are the Slaves of Fate. Why
therefore do we flatter our selves that the gifts of Fortune will stick by us,
or that Happiness will observe any Rule or Measure, Happiness the most
fleeting of all humane Things? They that promise to themselves all things
fixt, surely never think that the very Ground we stand on is it self unfixt.
Nor was that the frailty only of <HI>Campania</HI> or <HI>Achia,</HI> 'tis the same in all
Soils and Countries, to be loosely join'd and compacted, but easily and by
many ways dissolved; the whole remains while each part changes and sinks
into Ruine and Alteration.”</P>
<P>Thus we see all Countries in the World are subject to these Convulsions,
out those most of all that are most Mountainous: Such are usually all the Sea
Coasts, therefore <HI>Pliny</HI> says, That the <HI>Alps,</HI> and <HI>Appnnine</HI> Mountains have
very often been troubled with Earthquakes. <HI>Maritima autem maxime quati∣untur</HI>
(says he) <HI>nec montosa tali malo carent. Exploratum est mihis Alpes Appenni∣num{que}
saepius tremuisse.</HI> Martine places are most shaken, nor do the Mountain∣ous
escape, for I have often found the <HI>Alpes</HI> and <HI>Apennines</HI> tremble.</P>
<P>For most probably those that are most Mountainous, are most Cavernous un∣derneath
them; to countenance which Opinion, I remember to have taken
notice in certain very high Cliffs towards the Sea side, where the Hills seem∣ed,
as it were, cleft asunder, the one half having been probably foundred and
tumbled down into the Sea, and the other half, as it were remaining, that at
the bottom, near the Water, for almost the whole length, there were very
many large Caverns, which, by several Circumstances, seem'd to be made be∣fore
the access of the Sea thereunto, and not by the washing and beating of
the Waves against the bottom of these Cliffs; for I observ'd in many of them,
that the Plates or Layers, as I may so call those parts between the Clefts in
<PB N="312" REF="289"/>
Rocks, and Cliffs to lean contrary ways, and to meet, as it were, at the top
like the Roof of a House, and others of them in other forms, as if they had
been Caverns left between many vast Rocks tumbled confusedly one upon another.
And indeed I cannot imagine, hut that under these Mountains, Islands,
Cliffs or Lands, that have been much rais'd above their former level, there
must be left vast Caverns, whence all that Matter was thrown, where pro∣bably
may be the Seat or Place of the Generation of those prodigious Pow∣ers.
But this only by the Bye; for I intend not here to examine the causes
of their beginnings, force, and powerful Effects, nor of their remaining, ceas∣ing,
renewing, or the like. It being sufficient, for my present purpose, to
shew, That they have been certainly observ'd to produce those extraordinary
Effects from what Cause soever they proceed. That they have been hereto∣fore
in many places where they have now ceas'd for many Ages; and that
they have lately happen'd in places, where we have no History that does as∣sure
us they have been heretofore. That they have turn'd Plains into Moun∣tains,
and Mountains into Plains; Seas into Land, and Land into Seas; made
Rivers where there were none before, and swallowed up others that formerly
were; made and destroy'd Lakes, made Peninsuls Islands, and Islands Penin∣sulas;
vomited up Islands in some places, and swallowed them down in others;
overturn'd, tumbl'd and thrown from place to place Cities, Woods, Hills,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> cover'd, burnt, wasted and chang'd the superficial Parts in others; and
many the like strange Effects, which, since the Creation of the World, have
wrought many very great changes on the superficial Parts of the Earth, and
have been the great Instruments or Causes of placing Shells, Bones, Plants,
Fishes, and the like, in those places, where, with much astonishment, we
find them.</P>
<P>Concerning the Vicissitudes that places are subject to, in relation to Earth∣quakes,
I find a memorable Passage sent by <HI>Paul Ricaut</HI> Esguire, now Consule
of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> Dated <HI>Novomber</HI> 23. 1667. <HI>“Constantinople,</HI> says he, is not now so
subject to Earthquakes as reported in former times, there having not hap∣pen'd
in the last seven Years, in which I have been an Inhabitant there, above
one of which I have been sensible; but within these twenty Days in <HI>Smyrna</HI>
fell out an Earthquake which dangerou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly shook all the Buildings, but did
little or no harm; the Ships in the Road, and others at an Anchor, about
three Leagues from hence, were sensible of it. It is reported that this
City hath been already seven times devoured by Earthquakes, and it is pro∣phesied,
that it shall be so again so soon as the Houses reach the old Castle
upon the top of the Hill, on the side of which remains the Ruins of the old
City and the Tomb of St. <HI>Polycarpus,</HI> St. <HI>John</HI>'s Disciple, still preserv'd by
the <HI>Greek<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in great Veneration.”</P>
<P>Another Cause there is which has been also a very great Instrument in the
promoting the alte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ations on the Surface of the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Motion of the Water an∣other cause of alterations on the Earth.</NOTE> and that is the motion
of the Water; whether caus'd <HI>1st.</HI> By its Descent from some higher place, such
as Rivers and Streams, caus'd by the immediate falls of Rain, or Snow, or by
the melting of Snow from the sides of Hills. Or, <HI>2dly.</HI> By the natural Mo∣tions
of the Sea, such as are the Tides and Currents. Or, <HI>3dly.</HI> By the ac∣cidental
motions of it caus'd by Winds and Storms. Of each of these we
have very many Instances in Natural Historians, and were they silent, the
constant Effects, would daily speak as much. The former Principle seems
to be that which generates Hills, and Holes, Cliffs, and Caverns, and all
manner of Asperity and irregularity in the Surface of the Earth; and this
is that which indeavours to reduce them back again to their pristine Re∣gularity,
by washing down the tops of Hills, and filling up the bottoms of
Pits, which is indeed consonant to all the other methods of Nature, in work∣ing
with contrary Principles of Heat and Cold, Driness, and Moisture,
Light and Darkness, <HI>&amp;c</HI> by which there is, as it were, a continual circu∣lation.
Water is rais'd in Vapours into the Air by one Quality and precipa∣ted
down in drops by an other, the Rivers run into the Sea, and the Sea, a∣gain
supplies them. In the circular Motion of all the Planets, there is a di∣rect
Motion which makes them indeavour to recede from the Sun or Center,
<PB N="313" REF="290"/>
and a magnetick or attractive Power that keeps them from receding. Ge∣neration
creates and Death destroys; Winter reduces what Summer pro∣duces:
The Night refreshes what the Day has scorcht, and the Day cherishes
what the Night benumb'd. The Air impregnates the Ground in one place,
and is impregnated by it in another. All things almost circulate and have
their Vicissitudes. We have multitudes of instances of the wasting of the
tops of Hills, and of the filling or increasing of the Plains or lower Grounds,
of Rivers continually carrying along with them great quantities of Sand,
Mud, or other Substances from higher to lower places. Of the Seas wash∣ing
Cliffs away and wasting the Shores: Of Land Floods carrying away with
them all things that stand in their way, and covering those Lands with Mud
which they overflow, levelling Ridges and filling Ditches. Tides and Cur∣rents
in the Sea act in all probability what Floods and Rivers do at Land;
and Storms effect that on the Sea Coasts, that great Land Floods do on the
Banks of Rivers. <HI>Aegypt</HI> as lying very low and yearly overflow'd, is inlarg'd by
the sediment of the <HI>Nile;</HI> especially towards that part where the <HI>Nile</HI> falls in∣to
the <HI>Mediterranean.</HI> The Gulph of <HI>Venice</HI> is almost choak'd with the Sand of
the <HI>Po.</HI> The Mouth of the <HI>Thames</HI> is grown very shallow by the continual
supply of Sand brought down with the Stream. Most part of the Cliffs that
Wall in this Island do Yearly founder and tumble into the Sea. By these
means many parts are covered and rais'd by Mud and Sand that lye almost:
level with the Water, and others are discover'd and laid open that for many Ages have been hid.</P>
<P>Of this kind the Royal Society received a memorable Account from
the Learned Dr. <HI>Brown</HI> concerning a petrified Bone of a prodigious bigness,
discover'd by the falling of some Cliffs; the words of the Relation are these.
“This Bone (which he presented the Royal Society, and is now in the Re∣pository)
was found last Year 1666. on the Sea Shore, not far from <HI>Win∣terton</HI>
in <HI>Norfolk;</HI> it was found near the Clift after two great Floods, some
thousand Loads of Earth being broken down by the rage of the Sea, as it
often happens upon this Coast, where the Cliffs consist not of Rock but of
Earth. That it came not out of the Sea may be conjectur'd because it was
found near the Cliff, and by the colour of it, for if out of the Sea it would
have been whiter. Upon the same Coast, but as I take it, nearer <HI>Hasbo∣rough,</HI>
divers great Bones are said to have been found, and I have seen a lower
Jaw containing Teeth of a prodigious bigness and somewhat petrified. All
that have been found on this Coast have been found after the falling of some
Cliff, where the outward Crust is fallen off, it clearly resembles the Bones
of Whales and great Cetaceous Animals, comparing it with the Scull and
Bones of a Whale which was cast upon the Coast near <HI>Wells,</HI> and which I
have by me, the weight whereof is 55 Pounds.” Thus far he on this Sub∣ject.
“To this may be added the <HI>Chartham</HI> News, or the discovery of River∣horse,
or the <HI>Hippopotamus</HI> Teeth printed in the <HI>Philos. Transactions.</HI> N. 272.
p. 882”</P>
<P>Nor are these Changes now only, but they have in all probability been of
as long standing as the World. So 'tis probable there may have been seve∣ral
vicissitudes of changes wrought upon the same part of the Earth; it may
have been of an exact spherical Form, with the rest of the Earths or Planets,
at the Creation of the World, before the eternal Command of the Almighty,
that the Waters under the Heaven should go to their place; which before co∣ver'd
the Earth, so as that it was <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, invisible and incompleated,
and the Darkness of the Deep was over it (being all over cover'd with a very
thick shell of Water which environ'd it on every side, it being then in all pro∣bability
created of an exact Spherical Figure, and so the Waters being of
themselves lighter than the Earth, must equally spread themselves over the
whole Surface of the Earth) and where the Breath of the Lord moved above or
upon the Surface of these Waters. It may, I say, in probability have been then
a part of the exact Sphoerical Surface of the Earth, and upon the command
that the Waters under the Air or Atmosphere (which seems to be denoted
by <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or Firmament; for the Hebrew Word signifies an Expansum)
<PB N="314" REF="291"/>
should be gathered together into one place, and that the dry Land should ap∣pear.
It may have been by that extraordinary Earthquake (whereby the
Hills and Land were rais'd in one place, and the Pits or deeper places, whe∣ther
the Water was to recede and be gathered together to constitute the
Sea were sunk in another rais'd perhaps to lye on the top of a Hill or in
a Plain, or sunk into the bottom of the Sea, and by the washing of Waters
in motion, either carried to a lower place to cover some part of the Vale,
or else be cover'd by adventitious Earth, brought down upon it from some
higher place; which kind of alterations were certainly very great by the
Flood of <HI>Noah,</HI> and several other Floods we find recorded in Heathen Wri∣ters.
If at least there were not somewhat of an Earthquake which might a∣gain
sink those Parts which had been formerly raised to make the dry Land
appear, and raise the bottom of the Sea, which had been sunk for the gather∣ing
together of the Waters (which Opinion <HI>Seneca</HI> a scribes to <HI>Fabianus) Ergo</HI>
(says he) <HI>cum affuerit illa necessitas temporis multa simul a fata causas movent nec sine
concussione Mundi tanta Mutatio est ut quidarn putant inter quos Fabianus est.</HI> His
description of the Manner and Effects of a Flood, is fine and very suting to
my present Hypothess. This Part being thus covered with other Earth,
perhaps in the bottom of the Sea, may by some subsequent Earthquakes, have
since been thrown up to the top of a Hill, where those parts with which it
was by the former means covered, may in tract of time by the fall and wash∣ing
of Waters, be again uncovered and laid open to the Air, and all those
Substances which had been buried for so many Ages before, and which the
devouring Teeth of Time had not consumed, may be then exposed to the
Light of the Day.</P>
<P>There are yet two other Causes of the mutation of the superficial Parts of
the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two other Cau∣ses of the chan∣ges on the su∣perficial parts of the Earth: first from over∣flowing of the Streams and Inundations of the Sea.</NOTE> which have wrought many great changes in the World, and those
are either the Sea's overflowing of a Country or Place, when forced on it
with some violent Storms or Hurr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cans of Wind, or from the over-flowing
of Rivers from great falls of Rain, or from something stopping their Course, of
these we have many Instances in Voyages, and we have very often times here
at <HI>London</HI> felt the effects of the Wind driving in the Tide with such great
force, as that it has oft times overflow'd the Banks, fill'd the Streets and
Cellers to the no small damage of the Inhabitants. “At <HI>Chatmoss</HI> in <HI>Lank<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣shire</HI>
(saith <HI>Childery</HI>) is a low mossy Ground very large, a great part of which
(saith <HI>Cambden</HI>) not long ago, the Brooks swelling high carry'd quite away
with them, whereby the Rivers were corrupted, and a number of fresh Fish
peris<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed. In which place now lies a low Vale watered with a little Brook,
where Trees have been digg'd up lying along, which are suppos'd by some
to have come thus. The Channel of the Brooks being not scower'd, the
Brooks hare risen, and made all the Land moorish that lay lower than o∣thers,
whereby the Roots of the Trees being loosned by reason of the bog∣giness
of the Ground, or by the Water finding a passage under Ground,
the Trees have either by their own weight, or by some Storm, been blown
down, and so sunk into that soft Earth and been swallowed up: For 'tis ob∣servable,
that Trees are no where digg'd out of the Earth but where the
Earth is boggy; and even upon Hills such moorish and moist Grounds are
commonly found, the Wood of these Trees burning very bright like Touch∣wood
(which perhaps is by reason of the bituminous Earth in which they
have been so long) so as some think them to be Fir-Trees. Such mighty
Trees are often found in <HI>Holland,</HI> which are thought to be undermin'd by the
Waves working into the Shore, or by Winds driven forwards and brought

<P>“At the time when <HI>Henry II.</HI> made his abode in <HI>Ireland</HI> were extraordina∣ry
violent and lasting Storms of Wind and Weather, so that the Sandy Shore
on the Coasts of the <HI>Pembrockshire,</HI> was laid bare to the very hard Ground,
which had lain hid for many Ages, and by further search the People found
great Trunks of Trees, which when they had digged up, they were ap∣parently
Lopped, so that one might see the strokes of the Ax upon them,
as if they had been given but the Day before; the Earth look'd very black,
and the Wood of these Trunks was altogether like Ebony. At the first
discovery made by these Storms, the Trees we speak of lay so thick, that
the whole Shore seem'd nothing but a lopped Grove. Whence may be ga∣ther'd,
saith <HI>Childry,</HI> that the Sea hath overflow'd much Land on this
Coast, as it has indeed many Countries bordering upon the Sea, which is
to be imputed to the ignorance of the <HI>Britans</HI> and other barbarous Nations,
which understood not those ways to repress the fury of the Sea which we
now do. p. 142. 143.”</P>
<P>“In the low Places on the South side of <HI>Cheshire,</HI> by the River <HI>Wever,</HI> Trees
are oft times found by digging under Ground, which People think have lain
buried there ever since <HI>Noah</HI>'s Flood. p. 129.” “St. <HI>Bennets</HI> in the <HI>Holme</HI> ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h
such fenny and rotten Ground, that (saith <HI>Cambden</HI>) if a Man cut up the
Roots or Strings of Trees it flotes on the Water. Hereabout also are
Cockles and Periwinkles sometimes digged up out of the Earth, which makes
some think that it was formerly overflowed by the Sea.” Divers of these
Effects do seem to be caused by Inundations of the Sea, tho' there are o∣thers
of them that do rather seem ascribable to Earthquakes, than to In∣undations
caus'd by Storms; for that Earthquakes have produced such Ef∣fects
as the burying of Trees and Plants, divers of the fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>merly mention'd
Histories do sufficiently manifest.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lignum Fossile</HI> which is found in <HI>Italy,</HI> of which we have a good ac∣count<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Account of <HI>Lignum Fos∣sile</HI> and other Subternaneous M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tters.</NOTE>

out of the subterraneous Parts of the place where it has been found;
yet) from many remarkable circumstances in this History, it seems very probable
to me to have been first buried by some Earthquakes, and afterwards to be
variously metamorphosed and changed by the Symptoms which usually follow
Earthquakes, and which this place is much vexed with, as is indeed almost all
the Country of <HI>Italy,</HI> to wit, the emitting of hot Steams and Smoaks proceeding
from subterraneons Fires, which do their often shift their places, burn the
parts of some of those Trunks into black and brittle Coles; melt a kind of
Ore into the Pores of others; petrify the Substance of another sort; bake
the Dirt and Clayish Substances which have soaked into the Pores of a
fourth sort into a kind of Brick; rot the Parts of others, and convert them
into a kind of Dirt or Muddy Earth; and so act variously and produce dif∣fering
Effects upon those buried Substances, according to the Nature of the
Earths, Minerals, Waters, Salts, Heats, Smoaks, Steams, and other active
Instruments casually applied to the parts of the buried Trunks, by the con∣fusion
of the Earthquakes, and by immediate application, and long continu∣ance
and digestion, as I may call it, in this Laboratory of Nature, transformed
into other Substances, and exhibit all those admirable Phaenomena mentioned
by that Author, whereby the bury'd Bodies are transformed. Nor is it so
much to be wondered at, that such Substances as Vegetables (which being
exposed to the Vicissitudes of the Air and Water, are quickly corrupted
and consumed, and many of them much sooner if buried in the Earth) should af∣ter
so many Ages perhaps, remain intire, and rather more substantial sound
and permanent than if they were newly cut down.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whence the de∣cay of Bodies.</NOTE> Since if we consider the
Nature of the decaying and corruption in all kind of Animal and Vegetable
<PB N="316" REF="293"/>
Substances, we shall find that the chief cause of it seems to be from the Acti∣on
of the fluid Parts upon the solid for the dissolving of them: and whereso∣ever
the Internal Fluid is either first changed or altered by the mixture of
some other heterogenous Substance, so as to loose that dissolving property as
by the intermixture of Salt, Spirit of Wine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or by incorporating with it
and hardning it into a solid Substance, as in Petrifactions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Or, secondly,
exhaled by a gradual and gentle degree of heat, and so the solid Parts only
left alone, and kept either dry, or fill'd with a fluid of an heterogeneous
Nature, such as unctuous and spicy Juices with watery Substances. Or, Third∣ly,
Congealed and hardened either by cold or the peculiar Nature of the Juice
itself; such is freezing and the hardning of Coralline Plants, or Submarine
Vegetables, Horns, Gums, Bones, Hair, Feathers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> wheresoever, I
say, Bodies are by these means put into such a Constitution, that the Parts
act not upon one another, and continue in that state by being preserved by
adventitious Moisture or soft'ning by homogeneous Fluids, they are, as it were,
perpetual, unless by extraordinary Heat, many of these otherwise solid and
unactive Substances are made fluid by such active Disolvents; and unless
they be immersed in such Liquors or Menstruums as do of themselves dissolve
and work on them; we shall not, I say, wonder at the lastingness of these
buried Substances, if we consider also the various Juices with which several
parts of the Earth are Furnish'd, Unctuous, Watery, Styptick, Saline, Pe∣trifactive,
Corrosive, and what not. There are some Juices of the Earth
which do, as it were, perpetuate them by turning them into Stone. Others
do so deeply pierce and intimately mix with their parts, that they wholly, as it
were, change the Nature of those Substances, and destroy that property of
Congruity which all Bodies generated in the Air and Water seem to have,
which are very apt to be dissolved and corrupted by innate aerial and aqu ous
Substances. Such are all kinds almost of oleaginous and sulphureous Sub∣stances,
and divers saline and mineral Juices. Others indeed do not preserve
the very Substance of those Vegetables, but insinuating into the Pores, and
there, as it were, fixing, they retain and perpetuate the Shape and Figure,
but corrupt and dissolve the interpos'd part of the Vegetable; of all which
kinds I have seen some Specimina, as I have also of divers other Substances
Pickled, Dried, Candyed, Conserv'd, preserv'd, or Mummify'd by Nature:
where therefore the Substances have happen'd to be bury'd with preserva∣tive
juices, they have withstood the injury of Time; but where those Juices
have been wanting, there we find no Footsteps of these Monuments of
Antiquity.</P>
<P>But to return to what I was prosecuting, another cause which may make
alterations on the Surface of the Earth, is any violent motions of the Air,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A 2d Cause of alteratios on the Earth be∣side Earth∣quakes, is vio∣lent motions of the Air.</NOTE>
whereby the parts of the Earth, in dry Weather, are transported from place
to place in the Form of Dust. Of this kind Travellers tell us very strange Sto∣ries
of the removal of the Sands in the Deserts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and other Deserts
in <HI>Africa;</HI> and we have some instances of it here in <HI>England,</HI> to wit, in <HI>Nor∣folk</HI>
and <HI>Dev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nshire</HI> (in the former of which there are often found natural
Mummies which have been buried alive by those removing Sands, and by their
driness preserv'd) But these greater and more suddain removals of Sand and
Dust are not so universal, and therefore not so much to my present purpose;
tho' possibly they may have been more frequent heretofore, which the Layers
of Sands to be found in digging Pitts and Wells seem to hint: But that which
is most universal, is very flow, and almost inperceptible, and that is the re∣moving
of the Dust from the higher Parts, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ettling in the lower by the
Wind or motion of the Air. This tho' its effects be almost insensible, yet
being constant, must needs, in length of time, much promote the levelling
and smoothing of the Sursace of the Earth.</P>
<P>I might name also another cause of the transposition of the superficial Parts
of the Earth; and that is from the gradual subsiding or sinking into the Earth
of the more heavy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3dly, A gradu∣al sinking of heavy Bodies into the Sur∣face.</NOTE> and the Ebullition or respective rising of the more light
Parts upwards. Hence we may observe, that many old and vast Buildings
<PB N="317" REF="294"/>
and Towers have sunk into the Earth. And the like we judge of those vast
Stones in <HI>Salisbury</HI> Plain, and we find constantly almost in all Stone Monu∣ments
placed in Church-yards, and in all old Churches unless placed on a∣very
high place, and founded on some Rock. The Cause may possibly have
great Influence where the Earth is very soft, spungy, or boggy; and possibly
many of those Trees which are found in boggy Grounds, may have been bu∣ried,
by having been either fell'd, or blown down by Wind, or wash'd down
by some Inundation well impregnated with mineral Juices, and so made hea∣vier
than the subjacent Earth, and swallowed into it. Several of the for∣mer
Relations do. indeed prety well agree with this Hypothesis; and I am
very apt to think that where the Surface of the Earth has not been much al∣ter'd
since the Creation, if any such there be, if it were search'd into it would
be found that the lightest Parts, lye next the Surface, and so heavier in lower
Parts, which makes me imagine that the natural place of Minerals is very
deep under the Surface of the Earth, and (possibly) to be found under e∣very
step of Ground, were search made under it to a sufficient depth; and
that the reason why we find it sometimes near the Surface of the Earth, as in
Mountains, is not because it was there generated, but because it has been
by some former Subterraneous Eruption (by which those Hills and Moun∣tains
have been made) thrown up towards the Surface of the Earth. And as
Gold is the heaviest, so it is the scarcest of all Mettals. And I do not at all
question but that there may be other Bodies or Mettals as much heavier
than Gold, as Gold is then common Earth. To make these Conjectures the
more probable, see what Sir <HI>Philiberto Vernatti</HI> writes from <HI>Batavia</HI> in the
<HI>East-Indies</HI> in answer to some Queries sent him by the Royal Society. “I
have often (says he) felt Earthquakes here, but they do not continue long.
In the Year 1656, or 57, (I do not remember well the time) <HI>Batavia</HI> was
covered in one Afternoon about two of the Clock, with a black Dust, which
being gathered together, was so ponderous, that it exceeded the weight
in Gold. It is here thought that it came out of a Hill that burneth in <HI>Sumatra</HI>
near <HI>Endrapeor.</HI></P>
<P>These fiery Eruptions in all probability come from a very great depth
and with a great violence; and possible even that golden Powder that is
sometimes thrown up may have somewhat conduced to the cause of the vio∣lence
of it. We know not what Method Nature may have to prepare an
<HI>Aurum Fulminans</HI> of her own, great quantities of which, being any ways heat∣ed
and so fired, may have produced the Powder. However, whether so or
not, it were very well worth trial to examine, whether the Flower that may
be catch'd in a Glass Body, upon fulminating a quantity of such Powder gra∣dually
by small parcels, would, by being ordered as common Gold, make a∣gain
an <HI>Aurum Fulminans:</HI> Or whether this Fulmination, which is a kind of Infla∣ming
of the Body of the Gold, does not make some very considerable altera∣tion
in the Nature and Texture of it. Since we find that kind of Opera∣tion,
to wit, inflaming or burning does considerably alter the Texture of all
other Bodies so wrought on. This only by the way.</P>
<P>But to proceed to the last Argument to confirm the 6th Proposition I at
first undertook to prove,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The last Argu∣ment to prove the sixth Pro∣position from the Shells, &amp;c. found on, and in the Earth.</NOTE> namely, that very many parts of the Surface of the
Earth (not now to take notice of others) have been transform'd transpos'd
and many ways alter'd since the first Creation of it.) And that which to me
seems the strongest and most cogent Argument of all is this, That at the tops
of some of the highest Hills, and in the bottom of some of the deepest
Mines, in the midst of Mountains and Quarries of Stone, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> divers Bodies
have been and daily are found, that if we thoroughly examine we shall find
to be real shells of Fishes, which for these following Reasons we conclude to
have been at first generated by the Plastick faculty of the Soul or Life-prin∣ciple
of some animal, and not from the imaginary influence of the Stars, or
from any Plastick faculty inherent in the Earth itself so form'd; the stress of
which Argument lies in these Particulars.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="295"/>
First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st. Proof that they are true Shells.</NOTE> That the Bodies there found have exactly the Form and Matter,
that is, are of the same kind of Substance for all its sensible Properties, and
have the same External and Internal Figure or Shape with the Shells of Animals.</P>
<P>Next,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d. Proof.</NOTE> That it is contrary to all the other acts of Nature, that does nothing
in vain, but always aims at an end, to make two Bodies exactly of the same
Substance and Figure, and one of them to be wholly useless, or at least with∣out
any design that we can with any plausibility imagine. The Shells of Ani∣mals,
to our Reason, manifestly appear to be done with the greatest Coun∣cel
and Design, and with the most excellent contrivance, both for the Conve∣nience
and Ornament of that Animal to which it belongs, that the par∣ticular.
Structure and Fabrick of that Animal was capable of: Whereas these
if they were not the Shells of Fishes, will be nothing but the sportings of
Nature, as some do finely fancy, or the effects of Nature idely mocking
herself, which seems contrary to her Gravity. But this perhaps may not
seem so cogent, tho', if it be thoroughly consider'd, there is much weight in
it.</P>
<P>Next therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d. Proof.</NOTE> Wherever Nature does work by peculiar Forms and Sub∣stances,
we find that she always joins the Body so fram'd with some other pe∣culiar
Substance. Thus the Shells of Animals, whilst they are forming are
join'd with the Flesh of the Animal to which they belong. Peculiar Flowers,
Leaves, and Fruit are appropriated to peculiar Roots, whereas these on the
contrary are found mixt with all kind of Substances, in Stones of all kinds,
in all kinds of Earth, sometimes expos'd to the open Air without any co∣herence
to any thing. This is at least an Argument that they were not gene∣rated
in that posture they are found; that very probably they have been
heretofore distinct and disunited from the Bodies with which they are now
mixt, and that they were not formed out of these very Stones or Earth, as some
Imagine, but deriv'd their Beings from some preceding Principle.</P>
<P>Fourthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th. Proof.</NOTE> Wherever else Nature works by peculiar Forms, we find her al∣ways
to compleat that form, and not break off abruptly. But these Shells
that are found in the middle of Stones are most of them broken, very few
compleat, nay, I have seen many bruised and flaw'd, and the parts at a
pretty distance one from another, which is an Argument that they were not
generated in the place where they are found, and in that posture, but that
they have been sometimes distinct and distant from those Substances, and
then only placed, broken and disfigured by chance, but had a preceeding
and more noble Principle to which they ow'd their Form, and by some hand
of Providence, were cast into such places where they were filled with such
Substances, as in tract of Time have condensed and hardened into Stone: This, I
think, any impartial Examiner of these Bodies will easily grant to be very prob∣able,
especially if he take notice of the Circumstances I have already menti∣on'd.
Now, if it be granted, that there have been preceding Moulds, and
that these curiously figured Stones do not owe their form to a plastick or
forming Principle inherent in their Substances; why might not these be supposed
Shells, as well as other Bodies of the same Shape and Substance, generated
none knows how, nor can imagine for what.</P>
<P>Further,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5th. Proof.</NOTE> if these be the apish Tricks of Nature, Why does it not imi∣tate
several other of its own Works? Why do we not dig out of Mines ever∣lasting
Vegetables, as Grass for instance, or Roses of the same Substance,
Figure, Colour, Smell? <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Were it not that the Shells of Fishes are made
of a kind of stony Substance which is not apt to corrupt and decay. Where∣as,
Plants and other animal Substances, even Bones, Horns, Teeth and
Claws are more liable to the universal Menstruum of Time. 'Tis probable
therefore, that the fixedness of their Substance has preserved them in their
pristine Form, and not that a new plastick Principle has newly generated
<PB N="319" REF="296" MS="y"/>
them. Besides, why should we not then doubt of all the Shells taken
up by the Sea-shore, or out of the Sea (if they had none when we found
them) whether they ever had any Fifth in them or not? Why should we not
here conceipt also a plastick Faculty distinct from that of the Life-principle
of some Animal; is it because this is more like a Shell than the other? That
I am sure it cannot be. Is it because 'tis more obvious how a Shell should be
placed there? If so, 'twould be as good Reason to doubt if an Anchor should
be found at the top of a Hill, as the Poet affirms, or an Urn or Coins
buried under Ground, or in the bottom of a Mine, whether it were ever
an Anchor, or an Urne, or a coined Face, or made by the plastick Faculty
of the Earth, than which what could be more absurd: And those Persons
that will needs be so over confident of their Omniscience of all that has been
done in the World, or that could be, may, if they will vouchsafe, suffer
themselves to be asked a Question, Who inform'd them? Who told them where
<HI>England</HI> was before the Flood; nay, even where it was before the <HI>Roman</HI>
Conquest, for about four or five thousand Years, and perhaps much longer;
much more where did they ever read or hear of what <HI>Changes</HI> and <HI>Transpositions</HI>
there have been of the parts of it before that? What History informs us of the
burying of those Trees in <HI>Cheshire</HI> and <HI>Anglesy?</HI> Who can tell when <HI>Tenariff</HI>
was made? And yet we find that most judicious Men that have been there
and well considered the form and posture of it, conclude it to have been at
first that way produced. But I suppose the most confident will quickly upon
examination, find that there is a defect of Natural History; if therefore
we are left to conjecture, then that must certainly be the best that is backed
with most Reason, that Clay, and Sand, and common Shells can be chang∣ed
and incorporated together into Stones very hard. I have already given
many instances, and can produce hundreds of others, but that I think it
needless, that several parts of the bottom of the Sea have been thrown up
into Islands and Mountains. I have also given divers Instances, and those
some of them within the Memory of Man, where 'tis not in the least to be
doubted but that there may be found some Ages hence several Shells at the
tops of those Hills there generated; and as little, that if Quarries of Stone
should be hereafter digged in those places, there would be found Shells incorporated
with them; and were they not beholding to this inquisitive and
learned Age for the History of that Eruption, they might as much won∣der
how these Shells mould come there, and ascribe them to a plastick Fa∣culty,
or some imaginary Influence, as plausibly as some now do. I have also
shewed, that Water and divers other fluid Substances, may be, in tract of
Time, converted into Stone and stony Substances; and so such Liquors pe∣netrating
the Pores of these Shells, and especially if they be assisted by the
benumming Steams that sometimes issue from Subterraneous Erruptions, may
very much contribute to the preservation of those Shells from Corruption and
crumbling to Dust under the crushing Foot of Time. Besides, that the Shells
themselves are so near the Nature and Substance of Stone, that they are lit∣tle
subject to the injuries of the Air or Weather; so that these small pyrami∣dal
Houses of Shell-Fishes seem not less lasting Monuments than those vast
piles of Stones erected by the antient Inhabitants of <HI>Egypt,</HI> which outvye
all the more curious Fabricks of <HI>Grecian</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Architecture both for their
Antiquity and present Continuance. Nor do they exceed the Works of
Architects for lasting only, but for Ornament, for Strength, and for Convenience.</P>
<P>Now if all these Bodies have been really such Shells of Fishes as they most
resemble, and that these are found at the tops of the most considerable
Mountains in the World as <HI>Caucasus,</HI> the <HI>Alps,</HI> the <HI>Andes,</HI> the <HI>Appennine,</HI> and
<HI>pyrrenean</HI> Mountains, to omit other Hills nearer and of less note, and that
tis not very probable that they were carried thither by Mens Hands, or
by the Deluge of <HI>Noah,</HI> or by any other more probable way than that of
Earthquakes; 'tis a very cogent Argument that the superficial Parts of
the Earth have been very much changed since the beginning, that the tops of
Mountains have been under the Water, and consequently also, that divers
parts of the bottom of the Sea have been heretofore Mountains: For tho' I
<PB N="320" REF="297"/>
confess I have but few Instances to prove it, besides that of <HI>Plato</HI>'s
<HI>Atlantis,</HI> and some others that I have already mention'd; yet 'tis very
probable, that whensoever an Earthquake raises up a great part of the
Earth in one place, it suffers another to sink in another place; for Gra∣vity
is a Principle that will not long suffer a space to remain unfill'd under so
vast a pile of Earth as a Mountain, unless the Substances, so thrown up, be
of very hard, close and vast Stones that may, as it were, vault it: In which
cases 'tis very, probable (and <HI>Kircher</HI> and divers other Authors that write of
Mines and Quarries, gives us many instances to confirm it) that these Cracks
and Cliffs so left, are fill'd up with such Petrifying or Mineral Waters as do
make great varieties of Stones, Marbles, Sparrs, Caulks, and Ores, and so
there is made a transposition as well as a transformation. Which supposition
(by the way) I think will furnish a very probable Reason of the shape of the
Veins and Cracks of speckled Marbles and other Stones, of the form also of
the Veins of Ores, Stones, Clays, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the Earth, and of their so mixing
together; of the lying of Mettals in Mountains and other Mines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but
of these only here by the Bye, because I refer what I have to say of that to
another Subject, <HI>viz.</HI> A History of the Forms and Proprieties of Minerals and
Metals. To proceed then.</P>
<P>The Seventh Proposition that I undertook to make probable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The seventh Proposition con∣firmed.</NOTE> was, That
'tis very probable that divers of these Transpositions and Metamorphoses
have been wrought even here in <HI>England:</HI> Many of its Hills have probably
been heretofore under the Sea, and divers other parts that were heretofore
high Land and Hills, have since been covered with the Sea. Of the latter of
these I have given many Instances already, and that which makes the first
probable, is the great quantities of Shells that are found in the most Inand
Parts of this Island; in the Hills, in the Plains, in the bottoms of Mines and
in the middle of Mountains and Quarries of Stones. Of this kind are those
Shells, which any inquisitive Man may find great quantities of in <HI>Portland</HI>-stone,
<HI>Purbeck</HI>-stone? Burford∣<HI>stone, Northamptonshire</HI>-stone, out of which I have of∣ten
pick'd Muscles, Cockles, Periwinkles, Oysters, Scallop, and divers o∣ther
Shells that are buried in the very Body and Substance of the Stone; and
indeed they may be found of some kind or other in almost all kinds of Stone.
That the <HI>Kainsham</HI> Snail Stones, and those found in several on her parts of <HI>En∣gland,</HI>
have been the Shells of Fishes, I hope the Arguments I have already
urged may suffice to evince. As also, that those Helmet Stones (of which
sort I my self have found in many places of <HI>England,</HI> and others have fur∣nish'd
me with many more found in other parts of it) are nothing but the
fillings of the Shells of a sort of Echini or Egg Fishes.</P>
<P>Now 'tis not probable that other M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns Hands, or the general Deluge
which lasted but a little while, should bring them there; nor can I imagine a∣ny
more likely and sufficient way than an Earthquake, which might hereto∣fore
raise all these Islands of Great <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> out of the Sea, as it
did heretofore, of which I have already mentioned the Histories; or as it
lately did that Island in the <HI>Canarys</HI> and <HI>Azores,</HI> in the sight of divers who
are yet alive to testifie the Truth and Manner of it: And possibly <HI>England</HI>
and <HI>Ireland,</HI> might be rais'd by the same Earthquake, by which the <HI>Atlantis,</HI> if
we will believe <HI>Plato,</HI> was sunk. And I doubt not but any inquisitive Man that
has opportunity of traveling and examining several of the Mountianous Parts
and Cliffs, and of the Mines, Quarries, and other subterraneous Parts of
<HI>England,</HI> will meet with a great many other Arguments to confirm this Sup∣position,
besides those I have already alledg'd: But those I hope may suffice
for the present to excite Men to this Curiosity, which was the chief reason of
this present exercise. And this makes way for the Eighth Proposition,
which is</P>
<P>Eighthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The eighth Pro∣position con∣firmed.</NOTE> That most of these Mountains and Inland places whereon these kind
of Petrify'd Bodies and Shells are found at present or have been heretofore, were
formerly under the Water, and that either by the descending of the Waters
to another part of the Earth by the alteration of the Center of Gravity of
<PB N="321" REF="298"/>
the whole bulk, or rather by the Eruption of some kind of Subterraneous
Fires or Earthquakes, great quantities of Earth have been deserted by the Wa∣ter
and laid bare and dry. That divers places have been thus raised by
Earthquakes has been already proved from many Histories; and then why
may not all of them have the same Original, especially since there is no other
more probable Cause that we know of, that should convey and place those
Shells on the tops of Mountains? That they really are Shells, and have been
the receptacle of Fishes, I hope the Arguments t have already alledg'd may
suffice to persuade: If then they have been Shells, and have been there
placed, why should we not conclude that That part hath been under the Wa∣ter
with as much reason as seeing Towers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> under the Water near—
—we do that those parts have been heretofore above Water, which Hi∣stories
inform us of, or as we might have done if we had had none even from
what the thing itself speaks. I think we may with as much reason doubt if an
Urn should be digg'd up full with old Coins, stamped with the lame impres∣sion,
made of the same Substance and Magnitude of those used by the ancient
<HI>Romans,</HI> or any other Nation, of which we have good History; First, Whether
ever those Coins were made by Mens Hands, or by a plastick Faculty of Na∣ture
for it is certainly no more difficult a task for Nature to imitate the
one than the other. And, Secondly, Whether ever that Urn were made and
those Coins were put into it and shaped by Mens Hands, or that they were
shap'd and thrown into it meerly by Nature; perhaps those suppositions
might not be impossible, but sure all Men will judge them very improbable:
And I think the Case in this particular I am speaking of very much the same.
First, That there is much greater reason to imagine the Shells so found to
have been the <HI>Exuviae</HI> of some living Creature, and next, that they have
been placed there where they are found when that part was under Water,
and that part to have since been rais'd up to that height above the Sea by some
preceding Earthquake. There is no Coin can so well inform an Antiquary
that there has been such or such a place subject to such a Prince, as these
will certify a Natural Antiquary, that such and such places have been under
the Water, that, there have been such kind of Animals, that there have been
such and such preceding Alterations and Changes of the superficial Parts of
the Earth: And methinks Providence does seem to have design'd these per∣manent
shapes, as Monuments and Records to instruct succeeding Ages of
what past in preceding. And these written in a more legible Character than
the Hieroglyphicks of the ancient <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and on more lasting Monuments
than those of their vast Pyramids and Obelisks. And I find that those that
have well consider'd and study'd all the remarkable Circumstances to be met
with at <HI>Teneriffe</HI> and <HI>Fayale,</HI> do no more doubt that those vast Pikes have been
raised up by the Eruption of Fire out of their tops than others that have
survey'd the Pyramids of <HI>Egypt,</HI> or the Stones on <HI>Salisbury</HI> Plain do doubt
that they have been the effects of Man's Labours. And they do it with as
much reason; for all Conclusions that are not immediately grounded on
Sense, or the result of it are but Hypothetical and from a Similitude; for
since it has been heretofore and lately seen, that such Eruptions have pro∣duc'd
such kind of Hills and Islands, and that the tops, of these Hills do as
yet born, and that there are all about the sides of them huge Stones and
Rocks, and even Mountains lying in Postures as if they had been tumbled
down from the top; 'tis a rational Conclusion to say, that 'tis very probable
these have had the same Original with those.</P>
<P>But as to those vast tracts of Ground that lye very far from the Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Change of the Earths Cent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of Gravity hinted.</NOTE> it
may perhaps to some seem not impossible, that the Center of Gravity or
Method of the attraction of the Globe of the Earth may change and shift
places, and if so, then certainly all the fluid parts of the Earth will conform
thereto, and then 'twill follow that one part will be cover'd and overflow'd
by the Sea that was before dry, and another part be discover'd and laid dry
that was before overwhelm'd. Now, tho' this Conjecture may at first
reading seem a little extravagant, yet if we consider, that as great altera∣tions
have been really observ'd, we may a little moderate a two severe Cen∣sure

<PB N="321" REF="300"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="322" REF="301"/>
That the Magnetical Poles and Meridians of the Earth have been al∣ter'd,
and that they do at this present continue to do so is granted almost
by all, and confirmed by a multitude of Observations made in divers Parts of
the World, and by collecting and comparing the Observations I have met
with▪ I suppose the Pole of the Magnetism to be at a certain distance from
the Pole of its daily Motion, and that it does move round that Pole at a cer∣tain
distance in a certain number of Years, and that it does annually pro∣ceed
in this Circle some parts of a Degree: So that whereas the Magnetical
Pole was formerly North-East of <HI>Russia,</HI> it is now grown North-West of it,
and a little to the Westward even of <HI>England</HI>'s Meridian. Monsieur <HI>Petit</HI>
Engenier to the <HI>French</HI> King, is of Opinion, That the Pole of the diurnal
motion of the Earth alters, but I confess I cannot in the least assent to it
from any of those Arguments that he alledges, but I do rather think that
divers or them do make against his Hypothess; yet 'tis not impossible but
that a very great Earthquake altering the Center of Gravity, may also alter
the Pole of Rotation; for we find by experience, that if any thing be laid
upon one side of a large <HI>Lignum Vitae</HI> Ball suspended by a String, and that Ball
be turned round upon the String, it shall not turn exactly about the Point
by which 'tis suspended, but about some other Point. Besides this, we know
that the direction of these Poles, as to the Heavens, doth vary, for whereas,
it pointed at a part of the Heavens many degrees distant from the Star in
the top of the tail of the little Bear, now it points almost directly towards
it. Besides this, we find that the Points of the Intersection of the Aequinoctial
and Ecliptick varies, and possibly even the motions of all may vary. A diurnal
Revolution of the Earth may perhaps have been made in a much shorter time
than now; possibly there may have been the same alterations in the Annual,
and then a Year, or a Day at the beginning of the World would not be of so
long a duration as now when those motions are grown slower; for if the
motions of the Heavens be analogous to the motion of a Wheel or Top, as
I think I can by very many Arguments make probable, then if the Earth
were (as it were) at first set up or put into a rapid circular Motion, like
that of a Top, 'tis probable that the fluid Medium in which it moves, may
after a thousand Revolutions, a little retard and slaken that motion, and
if so, then a longer space of time will pass while it makes i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Revolution
now than it did at first.</P>
<P>Hence possibly the long Lives of the Posterity of <HI>Adam</HI> before the Flood,
might be of no greater duration then Mens Lives are ordinarily now;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the old <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> lived no longer in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sense the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Men do now.</NOTE> for
though perhaps they might number more Revolutions of the Sun, or more
Years than we can now, yet our few Years may comprehend as great a space
of time; this perhaps might deserve to be inquired into had we a certain
measure of time, such as some would have a standing Pendulum of a certain
length; but since we are upon suspecting, we may even doubt whether the
power of Gravity itself may not alter in time; we find that the Poles of the
Loadstone may be changed, that it does take up more at one time than ano∣ther;
that its virtue may be wholly destroyed by Fire, and some other
ways; and besides that, one of these changes is really wrought in the Earth,
and therefore 'tis not impossible but that even the attractive Power of the
Earth (tho' I confess I think it quite differing from that of the Loadstone)
may be intended or remitted; if so then the Pendulum will be no cer∣tain
Standard for the examination of the length of Time by; for the more
the gravitating Power is increas'd, the quicker will be the Vibrations of a∣ny
Pendulum and the more weak it is, the slower are the Vibrations: But
this Digression only by the bye. To return then, I say, tho' somewhat may
be said for this Supposition I have started, yet I confess I do more incline to
believe that what Mutations there have been of the Superficial Parts, have
been rather caus'd by Earthquakes and Eruptions, which ushers in my Ninth
Proposition. Namely,</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="302"/>
That it seems very probable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ninth Pro∣position confirmed.</NOTE>
that the tops of the most considerable Moun∣tains
of the World have been under Water, and that most probably they
seem to have been raised to that height by some Eruption: So that those pro∣digious
piles of Mountains, are nothing but the effects of some great Earth∣quakes.
This the Poets seem'd to vail under the feign'd Story of the Giants,

<L>The Port was great and calmt with shelt ring Shores,</L>

<P>And as the Poets above-mention'd had particular Stories and Giants for
<HI>Sicily</HI> and Aetna, so had they also for other Vulcans, and from the frequency
of them in former Ages, about <HI>Greece</HI> and the other Parts of the Mediter∣ran<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an,
<HI>Sophocles</HI> calls them <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the Earth-born Army
of the Giants; and that nothing but Earthquakes were deciphered by these
Giants may be further collected from the place where they were said to be
bred, namely, the <HI>Phlegrean</HI> Fields in <HI>Campania,</HI> a part of which is now cal∣led
the Court of <HI>Vulcan,</HI> a place that is the vent of many “Subterraneous Fires.
`Tis (says <HI>Sandys</HI>) a naked Level, in form Oval 1246: Foot long, and 1000
broad, environ'd with high cliffy Hills that fume on each side and have their
<PB N="324" REF="303"/>
sulphureous Savour transported by the Winds to places far distant; you
would think the hungry Fire had made this Valley with continual feeding, which
breaks out in a number of places. Here the Fire and Water make a
horrible rumbling, conjoining together as if one were Fuel to the other,
here and there bubling up, as if in a Cauldron over a Furnace, and spouting
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into the Air at such time as the Sea is inrag'd with Tempests, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>”
Besides, how well do their Actions agree with the Effects of Earthquakes,
for they are said to throw up burning Trees against Heaven, and huge Rocks
and vast Hills, which falling into the Sea became Islands, and lighting on the
Land became Mountains. Nor does the manner of their Generation
speak less, for they are said to be generated by the Blood of Hea∣ven
falling down on the Earth, that is, by the heat or influence of the Ce∣lestial
Bodies operating within the Bowels of the Earth, and brought forth
of her Womb in revenge to the Gods, or that they break forth with such hor∣ror
and violence as if they threatned the Heavens. And he that shall
read the Description of the most notable of them <HI>Typheus,</HI> and compare it with
the natural Description of an Earthquake, will easily explicate the several
parts of the Poets mystical Descriptions.</P>
<P>This Theory which I have endeavoured hitherto to evince, tho' indeed it
be very hard positively to prove, we being, as I instanced before, very def∣icient
in Natural History, yet if we consider what has been already said, and
compare it with the late Observations of divers Travailers over them, we
may find it altogether more than probable. I have been inform'd by several
worthy Persons, that there are great store of Shells found at the tops of the
<HI>Alps, Appenine</HI> and <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Hills, which are by much the highest of <HI>Europe.</HI> And
I have now by me several of those Shells which have been dug out of them
and brought into <HI>England.</HI> If therefore these have been real Oyster-Shells
and Scallop-Shells as upon viewing the Substance and Make of them, I see
not the least cause to doubt; and that there are great quantities of them
to be found in divers Parts which lye buried in the Cliffs and incorporated with
the Stones; and if that these Mountains have been infested with Earth∣quakes
both formerly and lately, as we have several Histories that testifie;
and if that other Eruptions and Earthquakes have raised Mountains even
out of the bottom of the Sea, and that the power of included Fire is suf∣ficient
to move and raise even a whole Country all at once for some hundreds
of Miles, as Historians assure us: If to this we add the universal silence in
History of any part of <HI>Europe,</HI> or any of other certain places of the World
before the Flood, or indeed for almost two hundred Years after the Flood, I
think there will be much less scruple to grant it propable that the <HI>Alps,</HI> and
divers other high Mountains, on whose tops are found such numbers and va∣rieties
of Sea-Shells, may have been heretofore raised np from under the Sea,
and now sustain'd by the sinking of other Parts into the places from whence
they were raised. This the very form of them will also very much argue for;
for I have been inform'd by several that took diligent notice of it, that the
parts are continually tumbling down from the higher parts to the lower, and
that some of them do seem to overhang very strangely, which cannot in any
probability be imagin'd to be the form of the first Creation, it being con∣trary
to that implanted Power of Gravity, whereby all the parts of it are
held together and equally drawn towards the Center of it, and so all the
parts of it ought to have been placed in their natural position which must
have constituted an exact Sphere, the heaviest lowest, and lighter at the top
and the Water must have covered the whole Surface of the Earth, which
seems to have been indeed their first position, according to the Description
of <HI>Moses</HI> in <HI>Genesis,</HI> besides all those Hills that have been made by subterra∣neous
Eruptions are of the like Structure; such as the <HI>Pike</HI> of <HI>Tenariffe,</HI> the
<HI>Pike</HI> of <HI>Fayale,</HI> the new Mountain in <HI>Italy, Aetna</HI> and <HI>Vesuvius,</HI> all which
seem to have been made up of great Stones thrown up out of the Mouth of
their several Vulcans, many of which lie in such tottering postrures that oft
times they tumble down to the bottom, and make great destruction of the
parts beneath; of this we have lately had several memorable Examples. To
mention only two of three, we are inform'd by Historians, that among the
<PB N="325" REF="304" MS="y"/>
<HI>Alps</HI> in the <HI>Giisons</HI> Country, a Town named <HI>Plura,</HI> seated in a Plain at the
Foot of the <HI>Alps</HI> near the Hiver <HI>Maira,</HI> and continuing by estimation at the
time of its fatal Catastrophy, at least fifteen hundred People was, by the fal∣ling
down of a great part of a huge high Mountain that hung over the said
place upon the twenty sixth of <HI>August</HI> 1617, together with the Inhabitants,
in a moment crusht and buried deep in the Earth, and that there is nothing
now left in the place thereof but a vast abyss or bottomless Gulf. And
we are now newly inform'd by Letters brought out of <HI>Italy</HI> that a great part
of the City of <HI>Ragusa</HI> has been this Year destroyed by the like falling down of
some part of the Mountain above it.</P>
<P>The Tenth and last Conjecture which I shall at present mention (as reserv∣ing
some others which will seem at first sight much more strange and extra∣vagant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The tenth Pro∣position confimed.</NOTE>
till I can by a sufficient number of Observations make them more
plausible) is, that it seems not improbable but that the greatst part of the
inequality of the Earths Surface may have proceeded from the subversions and
over turnings of some preceeding Earthquakes.</P>
<P>And for making this Conjecture probable, I might repeat all the Arguments
I have already urged to make probable the Generations of Islands, Moun∣tains,
Abysses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but that I suppose will be needless, they having been so
lately mention'd. I could also instance in a multitude of other smaller effects
produced by Earthquakes, of making the Surface of the Earth irregular; but
those are so numerous, and so very well known in those places where Earth∣quakes
are more frequent, as in <HI>Italy, Turky,</HI> the East and West <HI>Indies,</HI> &amp;c.
that I shall not insist on them. To this I might add the universality of Earth∣quakes,
there being no part of the World of which we have any good account,
but we find to have been some time or other shaken by Earthquakes; and 'tis
very probable had we receiv'd any certain account of the State and Constitu∣tion,
and being of the Earth in its Infancy (as I may say) or first Being of the
Earth after its Creation, when 'tis not improbable but the parts of it that lay
uppermost and next the other were more fluid and soft, we might have had
a thousand otherobservables. Of which I shall say more hereafter when I men∣tion
some other Conjectures.</P>
<P>Thus much only I shall add at present, that from what I have instanced a∣bout
Petrifactions and the hardning of several Substances, it seems very pro∣bable,
that in the beginning the Earth consisted for the most part of fluid
Substances, which by degrees have setled, congealed, and concreted, and
turn'd into Stones, Minerals, Mettals, Clays, Earth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And that in pro∣cess
of time the parts of it have by degrees concreted and lost their Fluidity,
and that the Earth itself doth wax old almost in the same manner as Ani∣mals
and Vegetables do; that is, that the moisture of it doth by degrees de∣cay
and wast either into Air, and from thence into the Aether; or else by
degrees the Parts communicating their motion to the Fluidether either grow
moveless and hard, almost in the same manner as we find the Bodies of Ani∣mals
and Vegetables when they grow old in their several proportinate times,
all the Parts tend and end in solidity and fixtness, the Gelly becomes Gristles,
and the Gristles a Bone, and the Bone at length a Stone, the Skin from smooth
and soft grows rough and hard, the motions grow slow, and the moveable
Parts and Joints grow stiff, and all the Juices decay and are deficient. The
same thing happens in Trees and other Vegetables. If therefore the Parts of
the Earth have formerly, in all probability, been softer, how much more
powerful might Earthquakes be then in breaking, raising, overturning, and
otherwise changing the superficial Parts of the Earth? Besides, 'tis, not un∣likely
but Earthquakes might then be much more frequent before the Fuels
of those subterraneous Fires were much spent. That the Farts of the Earth
do continually grow harder and fixt and concrete into Stone, I think no one
will deny that has consider'd the Constitution of Mountains, the Layers and
Veins of them, the Substances mixt with them, the Layers of the several
Earths, Sands, Clays, Stones, Minerals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that are met with in diging
Mines and Wells, The Nature of Petrifying Waters, the shapes of Crystals▪
Ores, Talks, Sparrs, and most kind of precious Stones,
Marbles Flint▪
<PB N="326" REF="305"/>
Chalk, and the like, every of which are by their forms sufficiently disco∣ver'd
to have been formerly fluid Bodies, and whilst fluid, shaped into those
forms: One or two undeniable Instances I shall add of the fluidity of Flints,
and that shall be that I have now by me, a Flint that has so perfectly filled
the Shell of an <HI>Eeknius,</HI> and inclosed it also that it has received; all the im∣pressions
of the cracks of the Shells both on the Concave and Convex Part
thereof, and has exactly filled all the Holes and Pores there of, and has so
perfectly received all the shape thereof as if it were nothing but Plaister of
<HI>Paris</HI> tempered, Wax, or Sulphur that had been melted and cast on it; not∣withstanding
which it is a Flint so hard as to cutGlass very readily, and is of
a very singular and uniform Texture; to this I might add many others of
the like kind, which have the impressions of these and other Shells, and yet
are, some Marble, some Pebbles, some Agats, some Marchasites, some Ores,
some Crystals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Some Flints I have marked with impressions as exactly as
if they had been <HI>soft</HI> Wax stamp'd with a Seal.</P>
<P>Further, That the Subterraneous Fuels do also wast and decay, is as evi∣dent
from the extinction and ceasing of several Vulcans that have heretofore
raged, which Considerations may afford us sufficient Arguments to believe
that Earthquakes have heretofore, not only been much more frequent and
universal, but much more powerful. If to this we do add what I formerly
mention'd, that there seems to be no other, more probable and intelligible
Cause in Nature of the inequality of the Earths Surface, the natural Principle
of Gravity reducing the Parts of it as near to an exact spherical Figure as
their Solidity and forc'd Postures will permit, and consequently (as I men∣tion'd
before) the natural form produce'd by Gravity would be a multitude of
Spherical Shells concreted of the several Substances of which it consists, in∣campassing
each other, not unlike the Orbits or Shells (for we have no pro∣per
name for that kind of hollow Spherical Figure) of an Onion, or as the
<HI>Ptalemaiick</HI> Astronomers do fancy the solid Orbs of the Heavens, ranged e∣very one in its distinct Order according to its Density and Gravity; that is,
that which hath been heaviest would have approach'd nearest the Center,
or at least nearest to that part which is attractive and the cause of Gravita∣tion,
if such a Body there be in the middle of the Earth, and the next lighter
in the second place, and so on to the third, fourth, fifth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> according to
their several degrees of Gravity and Density, they would have taken their
several Quarters, and so Water would always have covered the Face of the
Earth, and the lighted Liquor would always have been at the top, and the
Air above that, and Aether above that; and as in Fluids so also in Solids, the
Shells of Gold would have been the lowest of any Body we yet know, that of
Quicksilver next, that of Lead next, and so the rest in their order, which
seems also really to have been the form of the Earth, till disturbed by Earth∣quakes,
which I conceive to be the reason of the scarcity of those heavy Bo∣dies
of Metal near the Surface, and of the greatest scarcity of Gold which is
the most heavy, and that it is not to be found but in such places where there
have in probability been great subversions by Earthquakes, as in Mountains,
or in Rivers running out of Mountains, or in Earth washt and tumbled down
from Mountains, and such like places, as by many Circumstances may be
guest to have been formerly deeper under the Surface of the Earth.</P>
<P>There is yet one Argument more that to me seems very good, and that is
fetcht from no less distance than the Moon and the Sun by the help of Te∣lescopes.
These Bodies, as I have formerly hinted in the latter end of my
Micrography, seem to have the fame Principle of Gravity as the Earth, which,
as I have there argued, seems probable from their Spherical Figure in gene∣ral,
and the several inequalities in particular, visible by the help of Tele∣scopes
on the Surface of the Moon, and the several Smoaks, and Clouds,
and Spots that appear on the Surface of the Sun; and as they have that
Principle in common with the Earth, so it seems to me that they are not
Free from the like motions with those of an Earthquake: For as to the Moon
tis easily to be perceiv'd through a Telescope, that the whole Surface of it
is covered over with a multitude of small Pits or Cavities which are in∣compassed
round with a kind of protuberant Brim, much like the Cavities
<PB N="327" REF="306"/>
or small Pits, which are left in a Pot of Alabaster Dust boyled dry by the
Vapours which break out of the Body it by the heat of the Fire; and
all the inequalities that appear on the Surface of that Body, seem, by their
form, to have been caus'd by an Eruption of the Moon, somewhat Analo∣gous
to our Earthquakes; all those Pits in the Moon being much like the Cal∣dera
or Vent at the top of Vulcans here on the Earth, or like those little
Pits left at the top or surface of the Alabaster Dusb by the natural subsiding
of that Dust in the place where the Vapours generated within the Body of
it break out. I need not, I think, spend time in urging Arguments to prove
the sufficient powerfulness of the Cause to produce Effects as great as any I
have ascribed to it, as being able to raise as great and high Mountains
as those of the <HI>Alps, Andes, Caucasus, Montes Lunae,</HI> &amp;c. especially since even
of late we are often informed of as great effects elsewhere, and even of the
shaking and moving those vast Mountains by our latter and more debilitated
Earthquakes, tho' those Mountains are now in probability much more com∣pacted
and tenacious by the since acquired Petrifaction, than they were be∣fore
their first accumulation; and tho' 'tis not unlikely but the Fuel or Cause
of the Subterraneous Fire may be much wafted and spent by preceding Con∣flagarations;
Yet possibly there may be yet left in other Parts sufficient
Mines to produce very great effects if they shall by any accident take Fire;
and 'tis not impossible but that there may be some Causes that generate and
renew the Fuel, as there are others that spend and consume it.</P>
<P>From all which Propositions, if at least they are true, will follow many o∣thers
meer Corollaries which may be deduced from them.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Corollairs from the fore∣going Proposi∣tions.</NOTE> ei∣their
swallowed up into the Earth, or sunk so low as to be drown'd by the
coming in of the Sea, or divers other ways quite destroyed; <HI>as Plato</HI>'s <HI>Atlan∣tis, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, That there, many have been as many Countries new made and<MILESTONE N="2"/>
produced by being raised from under the Water, or from the inward or hid∣den
Parts of the Body of the Earth, as <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, That there may have been divers Species of things wholly de∣stroyed<MILESTONE N="3"/>
and annihilated, and divers others changed and varied, for since we
find that there are some kinds of Animals and Vegetables peculiar to certain
places, and not to be found elsewhere; if such a place have been swallowed
up, 'tis not improbable but that those Animal Beings may have been de∣stroyed
with them; and this may be true both of aerial and aquatick Animals:
For those animated Bodies, whether Vegetables or Animals which were na∣turally
nourished or refresh'd by the Air would be destroy'd by the Water.
And this I imagine to be the reason why we now find the Shells of divers Fi∣shes Petrify'd in Stone, of which we have now none of the same kind. As
divers of those Snake or Snail Stones, as they call them, whereof great va∣rieties
are found about <HI>England,</HI> and some in <HI>Portland,</HI> dug out of the very
midst of the Quary of a prodigious bigness, one of which I have weighing
near Pound weight, being in Diameter about Inches, which
I obtain'd from the Honourable <HI>Henry Howard</HI> of <HI>Norfolk:</HI> We have
Stories that there have been Giants in former Ages of the World, and 'tis
not impossible but that such there may have been, and that they may have
been all destroyed, both they and their Country by an Earthquake, and the
Poets seem to hint as much by their <HI>Gigantomachia.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, That there may have been divers new varieties generated of the<MILESTONE N="4"/>
same Species, and that by the change of the Soil on which it was produced;
for since we find that the alteration of the Climate, Soil and Nourishment doth
often produce a very great alteration in those Bodies that suffer it; 'tis not to be
doubted but that alterations also of this Nature may cause a very great change
in the shape, and other accidents of an animated Body. And this I imagine
to be the reason of that great variety of Creatures that do properly belong
<PB N="328" REF="307"/>
to one Species; as for instance, In Dogs, Sheep, Goats Deer, Hawks, Pi∣geons,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> for since it is found that they generate upon each other, and that
variety of Climate and Nourishment doth vary several accidents in their
shape, if these or any other animated Body be thus transplanted, 'tis not un∣likely
but that the like variation may follow; and hence I suppose 'tis that
I find divers kinds of Petrify'd Shells, of which kind we have none now na∣turally
produced; of this sort are 'many of those Helmet Stones which have
been made the Petrifactions of Substances in the Shells of several sorts of
<HI>Echini,</HI> whose short have been destroyed by the alteration of the Nature of
that part of the Sea where they were produced; and hence 'tis we find scarce
any Shell-Fish in our <HI>English</HI> Sea that has a Shell like those sorts of <HI>Nautili;</HI>
from whence our <HI>Keinsham</HI> and other sorts of Snake-Stones are produced.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="5"/>Fifthly, 'Tis not impossible but that there may have been a preceding
learned Age wherein poslibly as many things may have been known as are now,
and perhaps many more, all the Arts cultivated and brought to the greatest
Perfection, Mathematicks, Mechanicks, Literature, Musick, Opticks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
reduced to their highest pitch, and all those annihilated, destroyed and lost
by succeeding Devastations. Atomical Philosophy seems to have been better
undertood in some preceding time, as also the Astronomy evinc'd by <HI>Coper∣nicus</HI>
the <HI>Aegyptian,</HI> and <HI>Chinese</HI> Histories tell us of many thousand Years more
than ever we in Europe heard of by our Writings, if their Chronology may
be granted, which indeed there is great reason to question.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="6"/>Sixthly, 'Tis not impossible but that this may have been the cause of a to∣tal
Deluge, which may have caused a destruction of all things then living in
the Air: For if Earthquakes can raise the Surface of the Earth in one place
and sink it in another so as to make it uneven and rugged with Hills and Pits,
It may on the contrary level those Mountains again, and fill those Pits, and
reduce the Body of the Earth to its primitive roundness, and then the Wa∣ters
must necessarily cover all the Face of the Earth as well as it did in the
beginning of the World, and by this means not only a learned Age may be
wholly annihilated, and no relicks of it left, but also a great number of the
Species of Animals and Plants. And 'tis not improbable but in the Flood of
<HI>Noah,</HI> the Omnipotent might make use of this means to produce that great
effect which destroyed all Flesh, and every living thing, save what was saved
alive in the Ark.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="7"/>Seventhly, 'Tis not impossibie but that some of these great alterations may
have alter'd also the magnetical Directions of the Earth; so that what is now
under the Pole or Aequator, or any other Degree of Latitude may have for∣merly
been under another; for since 'tis probable that divers of these parts
that have such a Quality may have been transpos'd, 'tis not unlikely but that
the magnetick Axis of the whole may be alter'd by it, after the fame manner
as we may find by experiment on a Loadstone, that the breaking off and
transposing the parts of it, do cause a variation of the magnetick Axis.</P>
<P>I could proceed to set down a great many other Corollarys that would na∣turally
follow from these Principles if certainly proved. But this Essay I inten∣ded
only as a hint or memorandum to such Gentlemen as travel or any other
inquisitive Persons, who for the future may have better opportunities of making
Observations of this kind, that they may be hereby excited, or at least in∣treated
to take notice of such Phaenomena as may clear this Inquiry tho' never
so seemingly mean and trivial, since it seems not improbable but that they may
discover more of the preceding duration and alterations of the World than
any other Observations whatsoever, and that thence may flow such instructi∣ons
as may be of some of the most considerable uses to humane Life and Soci∣ety,
to which end all our Philosophical Studies and Inquiries tend. Ended

give it in the first place.</P>

been made upon me in particular with more severe Aggravations. As to
what concerns my self I shall not now spend time in answering, designing to
do it by another way. But as to what concerns this Honourable Society, I
conceive it might be a satisfactory Answer to assure such Objectours that this
<HI>Society</HI> have been imployed in collecting such. <HI>Observations,</HI> and making such
<HI>Experiments</HI> and <HI>Trials</HI> as being fitly apply'd and judiciously made use of, will
very much tend to the advancement of <HI>Natural Knowledge:</HI> And tho' the
things so collected may of themselves seem but like a rude heap of unpolish'd
and unshap'd Materials, yet for the most part they are so qualified as that
they may be fit for the beginning, at least of a solid, firm and lasting Structure
of Philosophy.</P>

<P>I conceive, it may not be altogether unseasonable this following Year nor
improper for this <HI>Honourable Society's Care</HI> to make some attempt of that kind
by shewing some <HI>Specimen</HI> of such a Structure raised from Observations and
Collections of their own, that it may appear that they have not disquieted
themselves in vain, in heaping up such a Treasure which they know not who
shall enjoy or make use of; that is, to see whether any of these things they
have been collecting, will afford suifficient Evidence to ground a deduction of
a higher Nature upon, such as is more obscure to be seen, or more dififcult to
be ascertained of, to see whether, when a weight comes to be laid open the
Stones or the Bricks, the natural Observations, or the Artificial Trials and
Experiments, they will not crush under it, and fail of sufficient Solidity;
and if they do, whether such may not be fit for other places, and whether it
will not be necessary to seek out for some others that may be more firm and
solid, and such as are of a closer and better concocted qualification, which
may be more powerful to sustaine a higher Superstructure, and a greater
weight of Argument to be laid upon them.</P>

and Care; a Collection, tho' very great, made at a venture must needs con∣tain
abundance of such as will be of little use for the end aimed at, and not
only so, but will also prove a great Obstruction and Confusion in finding out
such as are proper, and in separating the Good from the Bad.</P>
<P>The Structure aimed at, is a true and certain knowledge of the Works of
Nature, and this is designed to be attained as fast as may be, and to be per∣fected
as far as may be; or the end of the Inquisition is the promotion and
increasing of Natural Knowledge.</P>
<P>The methods of attaining this end may be two,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Analytick Method.</NOTE> either the Analytick, or the
Synthetick. The firft is the proceeding from the Causes to the Effects. The
second from the Effects to the Causes: The former is the more difficult, and
supposes the thing to be already done and known, which is the thing sought
and to be found out; this begins from the highest, most general and univer∣sal
Principles or Causes of Things, and branches itself out into the more par∣ticular
and subordinate.</P>
<P>The second is the more proper for experimental Inquiry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Synthetick Method.</NOTE> which from a
true information of the Effect by a due process, finds not the immediate
Cause thereof, and so proceeds gradually to higher and more remote Causes
and Powers effective, founding its Steps upon the lowest and more immediate
Conclusions.</P>
<P>An Inquisition by the former Method is resembled fitly enough by that
Example of an Architect, who hath a full comprehension of what he designs
to do and acts accordingly: But the latter is more properly resembled to
that of a Husbandman or Gardener, who prepares his Ground and sows his
Seed, and diligently cherishes the growing Vegetable, supplying it continu∣ally
with fitting Moisture, Food, Shelter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> observing and cherishing its
continual Progression, till it comes to its perfect Ripeness and Maturity, and
yields, him the Fruit of his Labour. Nor is it to be expected that a Pro∣duction
of such Perfection as this is designed, should in an instant be brought
to its compleat Ripeness and Perfection; but as all the Works of Nature if
it be naturally proceeded with, it must have its due time to acquire its due
form and full maturity, by gradual Growth and a natural Progression; not
but that the other method is also of excellent and necessary use, and will very
often facilitate and hasten the progress to perfection. An Instance of which
kind I designed some Years since to have given this Honourable Society in
some of my Lectures upon the motions and influences of the Caelestial Bodies,
if it had been then thought fit; but I understand the fame thing will now be
shortly done by Mr. <HI>Newton</HI> in a Treatise of his now in the Press: But that
will not be the only Instance of that kind which I design here to produce,
for that I have divers Instances of the like Nature wherein from an <HI>Hypothesis</HI>
being supposed or a premeditated Design, all the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the Subject
will be <HI>a Priori</HI> foretold, and the Effects naturally follow as proceeding from
a Cause so and so qualified and limited. And in truth the <HI>Synthetick,</HI> way by
Experiments Observations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> will be very slow if it be not often assisted by the
<HI>Analytick</HI> which proves of excellent use, even tho' it proceed by a false po∣sition;
for that the discovery of a <HI>Negative</HI> is one way of restraining and limi∣ting
an <HI>Affirmative.</HI></P>
<P>But not to spend more time at present upon the more particular explicati∣ons
of These Methods, which would make of it self a very large Dis∣course,
I shall proceed to the Subject which I began to discourse upon the last
meeting, premising only in general what I think necessary thereunto, an Ex∣plication
of what I understand by natural Knowledge, or the Knowledge of Nature.</P>
<P>By Knowledge then in the highest <HI>idea</HI> of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Knowledge is and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow acquired.</NOTE> I understand a certainty of
information of the Mind and Understanding founded upon true and undeni∣able
Evidence.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="310"/>
True and undeniable Evidence is afforded whether immediately by <HI>Sense</HI> with∣out
Fallacy, or mediately by a true Ratiocination from such Sense.</P>
<P>I call that <HI>Sense</HI> without Fallacy, where the <HI>fallacies</HI> of Sense being detected
and known, the Evidence produced thereby is examined and found to be free
and clear of all such <HI>Fallacies.</HI></P>
<P>I call that true <HI>Ratiocination</HI> from such Sense, where being sure of the Pre∣mises,
the Conclusion necessarily follows from them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The true Me∣thod of Rea∣soning.</NOTE> which is the method
of Reasoning made use of it <HI>Geomotry,</HI> and by which we arrive at as great a cer∣tainty
of things unseen as seen. Thus Ovid describes the method of <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> in scalling the Heavens.</P>
<Q><L>—Is{que} licet caeli Regione Remotus</L>
<L>Mente Deos adiit, &amp; quae natura negabat</L>
<L>Visibus humanis, oculis ea pectoris hausit.</L></Q>
<P>Now tho' in Physical Inquiries, by reason of the abstruseness of Causes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The difficulty thereof in Natural Philosophy.</NOTE> and
the limited Power of the Senses we cannot thus reason, and without many
Inductions from a multitude of Particulars come to raise exact Definitions of
things and general Propositions; yet by comparing of varieties of such In∣ductions
we may arrive to so great an assurance and limitation of Propositions
as will at least be sufficient to ground Conjectures upon, which may serve
for making <HI>Hypotheses</HI> fit to be enquired into by the <HI>Analytick</HI> method, and
thence to find out what other Experiments or Observations are necessary to
be procured for the further progress in the <HI>Synthetick,</HI> which will question∣less
so far inform us of the general and universal progress of the Operations
of Nature, that nothing but what is really the truth shall be proposed but
the absurdity and insufficiency thereof will presently be detected and
proved.</P>
<P>So that tho' possibly we may not be able to produce a <HI>Positive</HI> Proof, yet
we may attain to that of a <HI>Negative,</HI> which in many cases is as cogent and
undeniable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Negative many times as cogent as an Affirmative.</NOTE> and none but a willful or senseless Person will refuse his assent
unto it. Thus much I thought was necessary to premise in order to what I
have further to propound to the Consideration of this noble Society upon the
Subject. I have discoursed of formerly only by way of Queries; it being my
aim at present to see what <HI>Positive</HI> or <HI>Negative</HI> certainty at least may be at∣tained
concerning the same, either from the information of Sense freed from
Fallacies or from the superstructures of Reasoning.</P>
<P>I propounded then two Hypotheses for the solution of the <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> ob∣serv'd
in <HI>Petrified Bodies,</HI> of the resemblance of Animal and Vegetable Bodies;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Petrified Substances.</NOTE>
sueh as the Shells and Bodies of Fishes, the Bones, Teeth, Hornes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of
Fish, and also of Terrestrial Animals, the Wood, Leaves, Bark, Roots, and
Fruits of Plants and Vegetables; which resembling Bodies are found to be
of variety of Substances,sometimes of Stone, as Flint, Marble, Black,
White, Gray, and of various other Colours, of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ree-stone, <HI>Portland-stone,</HI>
Chalk, and an infinite variety of other Stone, some harder, some softer: Of
various kinds of Clay, Earth, Sand, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they have been found near the tops
of the highest Hills, and the bottom of the lowest Wells and Mines, in the
middle of the solid Quarries of Stone and other Minerals, and those the
most remote, or at least very far distant from the Sea. Some of these have
the perfect representation of the Figure of su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h Creatures and other Substan∣ces
as are now well known, others of such as have some analogy and likeness
to them, yet different from what are known of those Species to which they
seem to belong, either in Magnitude, Figure, Colour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet retain such
characteristick marks as seem to indicate them to belong to this or that Spe∣cies
of Animals or Vegetables. Some of these are nothing but perfect Stones
of several kinds, others are inclosed with a Substance seeming to be the fame,
with that of the very Animal or Vegetable they resemble. Add to this, that in
as many varieties of places there have been found others of these Figured Bo∣dies,
<PB N="332" REF="311"/>
which have as to Sense the very same Substance and Figures with those
of the corresponding Species of Animals or Vegetables, and do not seem to
be at all of a potrify'd and stony Substance, but rather of an Animal or Ve∣getable;
of every of which Particulars I have viewd and examined Instances.
And if it were not for detaining you too long, could have here produced a
more particular Account and Description. But they being so generally known
at deast so universally almost spread over the whole Earth, so that no Coun∣try
almost but doth afford them, I thought it would be needless.</P>
<P>The Question now is how we shall come to a certainty of Knowledge con∣cerning
them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How to come to acertain know∣ledge of them.</NOTE> by which we may be able to understand what they really are:
And Secondly, What are the Cause of them. Thirdly, How they came to be disposed, placed, or made in those parts where they are, or have been
found. Fourthly, These Discoveries being made to satisfaction, of what use
or benefit will it be to Mankind, or how shall we be the wiser, or how will
this Knowledge be an improvement of Natural Knowledge? Which is the
aim of this Society.</P>
<P>For Answer then to these several Queries I shall propound these following
Considerations.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To know what Substance they are of.</NOTE> As to the way of knowing of what Substance they are, I conceive
there can be no better way than what we generally use when we inquire in∣to
the true Nature or Substance of any other Body when it is delivered to us
to be examined or denominated; for instance, if a peice of Metal be deliver∣ed
to be examined, it will first be viewed to see what Metal it resembles in
Colour and Consistence, or in such other obvious and sensible Qualifications
as may enable one to judge or guess what kind of Metal it is; as suppose
it resembles Gold for closeness and ponderousness, these give intimation e∣nough
of examining it yet a little more curiously, since all is not Gold that
glisters, and it may be that some Counterfeit in those more obvious Quali∣fications
has mimicked that noble Metal, to do this, it is tried further by be∣ing
put into good <HI>Aqua Fortis,</HI> to see whether that will dissolve it, for if
it doth, it cannot be Gold. Secondly, The Specifick Gravity thereof is
more curiously and exactly found by the help of Scales and Weights, by
which it is weighed in and out of Water, because if thereby it be found to
be lighter than Gold it cannot be Gold. Thirdly, By Hammering and a
Gold Beater, 'tis found to be Malleable, and by looking through the Leaf,
'tis found of a transparent Greeness and reflects a true Golden Colour, then
'tis tried by copelling and found fixed in the Fire, then it tarnishes not in the
Air, and Amalgams Readily with <HI>Mercury,</HI> then its Solution in AR tinges,
the Skin and Nails red, and a further trial shews it to tinge Glass of a Ruby
Colour. Now if it bear all these several ways of Examination, and answers
to the properties of Gold, it may safely be concluded to be true Gold, and
whoever shall deny it to be such must be looked upon as one that doth it
without Reason, unless he can produce a further Criterion by which it shall
be found to be very differing from it. Now, tho' this Metal were found at
the bottom of a Mine a hundred Foot under Ground, or at the top of a Hill
a hundred Foot above the Level of the Plain; or in the Pores of a growing
Vegetable; or in the Tooth or Thigh of an Animal, tho' possibly it may be
difficult to assign the Reason or Cause how it came to be placed there; yet
the Examiner hath the Evidence of Sense to assure him that this Metal is
Gold, and he ought to conclude and acquiesce in it, that such it is; otherwise
there can be nothing at all known that it is this or that Body, and then
there is an end of all further Inquiry or Experiment.</P>
<P>Now though there may not be known so many various ways of examining
every other kind of Body, as, by reason of the value of it, there have been
found out for Gold; yet in many Bodies at least a much less number will serve
the turn to give assurance, that the Body so examined is of this on that kind
and in many the very outward form as visible to the naked Eye, but especial∣ly
if the inward visibie appearance of the Substance be joined with it, will
<PB N="333" REF="312"/>
be assurance sufficient to force an Assent or Conclusion of what kind the Body
is that is so examined, and it ought not to be denied to be such without as
evident a manifestation to the contrary.</P>
<P>This Discourse I have been the larger in premising, because, till it be agreed
what is sufficient evidence to prove a natural Body of this or that kind there
can be nothing done. If Experimental Philosophy, and if Poofs of this kind
will not suffice, I cannot expect that all that I shall bring to prove the <HI>Hypothesis</HI>
will be of any validity. That then which I shall indeavour to prove is;</P>
<P>First, That there have been, and daily are found, the real Shells of Fishes
in such parts of the Earth as are much above the present Level of the Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Recapitulati∣on of the Heads mention'd Pag.</HI> 288. <HI>Supra.</HI></NOTE>
and others buried at a very great depth under the Surface of the Earth, where
notwithstanding, 'tis evident that they were not there placed by any humane
Power or Design.</P>
<P>Secondly, That many of these Shells are of a form differing from any of
those Shells of that Species to which they seem to belong, which are common∣ly
known at this Day.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That there are others of them which to all appearance are of the
very same Species now known and to be found living.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That there are many of these Shells which are and have been
in process of time, fill'd within and inclosed without with divers sorts of
Earth, such as, Clay, Lome, Sea Sand, and divers other kinds of Sand,
Mud, Chalk, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, That those filling and enclosing Bodies have been, and are by de∣grees,
in process of time, petrify'd and hardn'd into Stones of differing Na∣tures,
Hardness and Contextures retaining the Impression, Form, or Signa∣ture
of those Shells, so inclosed.</P>
<P>Sixthly, That those Shells so filled and inclosed, as above said, are ac∣cording
to the differing Nature of the Petrifactive Liquor or Juice: some∣times
also Petrify'd retaining still the same Figure they were of when the Pe∣trifactive
Juice began to operate upon them.</P>
<P>Seventhly, That others of them remain yet perfect Shells without Petri∣faction,
or Alteration, when as yet both the Substance that fills them, and that
which encloses them is converted into Stone of differing Natures arid Tex∣tures.</P>
<P>Eighthly, That many of these Shells are either by length of Time, or by
the Nature of the Petrifactive Juice perfectly rotted and decayed so as to be
easily frangible between one's Finger and Thumb into a very fine Powder and
yet serve to give a perfect Mould or Shape to the inclosed and Inclosing-Stone.</P>
<P>Ninthly, That in many cases the Shell is not only Petrify'd by the said
Juice, but sometimes after the impression hath been made as aforesaid, the
Shell hath been clearly dissolved and carried away from the inclosing and in∣closed
Substances, leaving only the Space empty where the said Shell hath
been placed.</P>
<P>Tenthly, That it sometimes happens that the Substance that filled the
Shell hath been Petrify'd, and after the Shell hath been rotted away, the Pe∣trify'd
Body that Was inclosed and had received that Impression, hath been
afterwards inclosed with a Substance which hath afterwards Petrify'd and so
inclosed it in Stone.</P>
<P>Eleventhly, That these kinds of Shells or the Petrify'd Substances that
have been formed by them, have been for all Antiquity, and are at this Day
to be found in most parts of the known World.</P>
<P>Twelvethly, That they are most of them differing from one another, tho'
all referable to same Species of Shell-Fishes now to be found; yet in many
particulars each of them also differing from them; that is, those that are
found in one Country or Region, are very differing from those of another
Country or Region, and that not only as to the Nature of the Petrify'd Sub∣stance
inclosed and inclosing, but also as to the Figure and Make of the
Shells themselves; and many of those also differing from the shape even of
<PB N="334" REF="313" MS="y"/>
those Shell-Fishes which are now to be found in such parts of the Seas which
are situated near to the places that they are found in.</P>
<P>Concurring to this Head I shall prove that Shell-Fsihes of the same Species
in differing Countries now to be found, have many differences one from an∣other,
as much as any one of those Petrify'd Bodies have from any of the pre∣sent Shells.</P>
<P>I have in my former Discourses explain'd the end and aim of these my Inqui∣sitions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The end of the Author's Dis∣courses.</NOTE>
namely, to make some Use and Application of several Observations
and Experiments that have been Collected in order to deduce some Doctrine
from them, which may serve to direct, such further Inquisitions as shall be necessary
for the perfecting, of the same, or at least to find whether such are
wanting, and of what Kind and Nature they are.</P>
<P>The Doctrine aimed at, is, the Cause and Reason of the present Figure,
Shape and Constitution of the Surface of this Body of the Earth, whether
Sea or Land, as we now find it presented unto us under various and very ir∣regular
Forms and Fashions and constituted of very differing Substances.</P>
<P>Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Histories deficient, and why.</NOTE> because when we look into Natural Histories of past Times, we find
very few, if any, Footsteps of what alterations or transactions of this Na∣ture
have been performed, we must be fain to make use of other helps than
what Natural Historians will furnish us with, to make out an account of the
History thereof: Nor are there any Monuments or Medals with Literal,
Graphical, or Hieroglyphical Inscriptions that will help us out in this our
Inquiry, by which the Writers of Civil Histories have of late Years been
much assisted from the great curiosity of modern Travellers and Collectors of
such Curiosities.</P>
<P>The great transactions of the Alterations, Formations, or Dispositions of
the Superficial Parts of the Earth into that Constitution and Shape which we
now find them to have, preceded the Invention of Writing, and what was pre∣served
till the times of that Invention were more dark and confused, that
they seem to be altogether Romantick, Fabulous, and Fictious, and cannot
much relied on or heeded, and at best will only afford us occasions of Con∣jecture.</P>
<P>For Proof then of the first Proposition that,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Proofs of the foregoing Pro∣positions menti∣oned</HI> Pag. 333.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I could produce a mul∣titude
of Authorities fetched out of printed Authors, and as many others
that I have received from the Relations of very credible Persons that have
found them themselves, but it would be too long, I shall therefore only name
one who was formerly a worthy Member of this Society, and well known to
divers here present, and that was Dr. <HI>Peter Ball,</HI> he passing, over the <HI>Alps</HI> to
go into <HI>Italy</HI> by a narrow Passage, where there was on the one hand a prodi∣gious
high Clisf above him, and on the other hand, as prodigious deep Preci∣pice
below him, observed in the Cliff a Layer of Sea Sand and Shells for a
very great length buried under that high Mountain above: he had the curi∣osity
to take up and bring home with him into <HI>England</HI> divers of them which
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e dug out of the said Layer of Sand which he shewed me, and I found them
to be true Oyster-shells, not Petrified but remaining perfect Shells, one of
which he gave me, and had divers others which he kept; he observed also, that
there were divers other Substances among the Sand as if it had been upon the
Sea-shoar. To this I shall add an Observation of my own nearer Home,
which others possibly may have the opportunity of seeing, and that was at
the West end of the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> in a Cliff lying within the <HI>Needles</HI> almost
opposite to <HI>Hurst-Castle,</HI> it is an Earthy sort of Cliff made up of several sorts
of Layers, of Clays, Sands, Gravels and Loames one upon the other. Some∣what
above the middle of this Cliff, which I judge in some parts may be a∣bout
two Foot high, I found one of the said Layers to be of a perfect Sea Sand
filled with a great variety of Shells, such as Oysters, Limpits, and se∣veral
sorts of Periwinkles, of which kind I dug out many and brought them
with me, and found them to be of the same kind with those which were ve∣ry
plentifully to be found upon the Shore beneath, now cast out of the Sea.
<PB N="335" REF="314" MS="y"/>
This Layer is extended along this Cliff I conceive near half a Mile, and may
be about sixty Foot or more above the high Water mark.</P>
<P>Another Instance I observed nearer this place, and that was in St. <HI>James</HI>'s
Fields, where St. <HI>James</HI>'s Square is now built, in which place when they were
making Bricks of the Brick Earth there dug, they had sunk several Wells,
which I judge might be near twenty Foot in depth, to procure Water for
that purpose; going down into several of those, I found, at the bottom, a
Layer of perfect Sea Sand, with variety of Shells, and several Bones, and o∣ther
Sunstances, of which kind I dug out enough to fiil a small Box and shew∣ed
them to Mr. <HI>Boyl,</HI> and also to this <HI>Society.</HI> And I was informed also, that
the same kind of Substances were found in digging of a Snow Well in St.
<HI>James</HI>'s <HI>Park;</HI> and I doubt not but whoever shall sink any where thereabout
to that depth will find the same things. Now whoever will consider the Posi∣tions
and Circumstances of the said places, will easily grant, I suppose, that
they could not be there placed by the Industry of <HI>Man,</HI> but must be ascribed
to some other cause to be fetched from <HI>Nature.</HI></P>
<P>As to the second Head, That, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I shall produce several Oyster and Cockle<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> p. 333.</NOTE>
Shells which have been and are to be found in many Parts of <HI>England,</HI> which
in many particulars of their shape, do differ from those of the Oysters and
Cockles now to be found; yet upon examination of them they may be found
to be true and perfect Shells by all sensible Qualities, except only their exact
shape, and therefore I conceive that to be sufficient Evidence to prove them
to be really such, because it is all the Evidence the Matter is capable of. If
in digging a Mine, or the like, an artificial Coin or Urne, or the like Sub∣stance
be found, no one scruples to affirm it to be of this or that Metal or
Earth he finds them by trial to be of: Nor that they are <HI>Roman, Suxon, Norman,</HI>
or the like, according to the Relievo, impression, Characters, or Form
they find them of. Now these Shells and other Bodies are the Medals, Urnes,
or Monuments of Nature, whose Relievoes, Impressions, Characters, Forms,
Substances, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are much more plain and discoverable to any unbiassed Per∣son,
and therefore he has no reason to scruple his assent: nor to desist from
making his Observations to correct his natural Chronology, and to conjecture
how, and when, and upon what occasion they came to be placed in those Re∣positories.
These are the greatest and most lasting Monuments of Antiqui∣ty,
which, in all probability, will far antidate all the most ancient Monu∣ments
of the World, even the very Pyramids, Obelisks, Mummys, Hiero∣glyphicks,
and Coins, and will afford more information in Natural History,
than those other put altogether will in Civil. Nor will there be wanting <HI>Me∣dia</HI>
or <HI>Criteria,</HI> of Chronology, which may give us some account even of the
time when, as I shall afterwards mention.</P>
<P>As to the Proof of the third Proposition, <HI>viz.</HI> That, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> All those Instan∣ces
I have named are of sufficient evidence, for that those which I found in
both those places I mentioned were of the same kinds with those that are now
to be found near those places, as whoever shall examine will find.</P>
<P>And the fourth will also from the same, and hundreds of others be as evi∣dent,
and therefore I suppose none will scruple to assent to this Proposition,
<HI>viz.</HI> That, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Page 333, especially if the truth of the former be gran∣ted,
which I conceive cannot be denied.</P>
<P>For Proof of the fifth Proposition namely, That, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The place I mentioned
before near the <HI>Needles</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Wight</HI> afforded a most evident
and convincing one as could well be desired, which was from the following
Observation. I took notice that the aforesaid Earthy Cliff did founder down
and fall upon the Sea-shoar underneath, which was smooth and Sandy, and
bare at low Water so as to be walked on, but at high Water a great part of
it was covered by the Sea. I observed several great lumps of the said Founder∣ings
lying below, some whereof, which lay next the Cliff, tho' they were some∣what
harden'd together more than they were above in the Cliff, were yet not
<PB N="336" REF="315"/>
hard enough to be accounted Stone; others of them that lay further into
the Sea were yet more hard, and some of the furthest I could not come at
for the Water, were as hard I conceived as <HI>Purbeck</HI> Paving (which is taken
up from the Shore of <HI>Purbeck,</HI> lying just opposite to it on the West side of
this Channel or Passage) divers of these Stones I observ'd to be made up of the
pieces of Earth that had foundred down from the Cliff, which I was assured
of by carefully observing and finding divers of them to consist of the several
Layers, and in the same order as I saw them in the Cliff; among the rest I
found divers that had the Layer of Sea Sand and Shells which I had observed
in the Cliff inserted in the Stone with the adjoyning Layers all petrify'd to∣gether
into a hard Stone. Here I found multitudes of the said Shells I before
mention'd to have observ'd in the Cliff, mix'd loosely with a Sea Sand; now
together with the said Sand both fill'd, inclos'd, and petrify'd altogether,
and I broke off many peices of the said Rocks, where I found the said Petri∣factions,
and found them much like other Stones I had seen from other Inland
Quarries here of <HI>England,</HI> wherein I had observ'd also such kind of petrify'd
Shells, tho' how they came there to be so Petrify'd I could not be so well in∣formed.
For that which I conceive was the cause of this suddain Petrifaction
(for I conceive those that I examin'd had not been Stones for very many Years,
which I judged by their distance from the present Cliff, and from the quanti∣ty
thereof, which <HI>Communibus Annis</HI> did founder down) was that close by this
Cliff, there is a vitriolate or aluminous Spring or Rill which runs into the
Sea, where formerly those Salts have been made of it by boyling, but has
been now omitted for many Years. These saline Springs or Rills I conjecture
mixing with the Sea-Water, may be the cause of the said Petrifaction, and
the want of it is the cause why other founderings in other parts of the said
Cliff are not at all so Petrify'd. Now from the assur'd Observation of these
Petrifactions, I cannot but judge that the truth of this Proposition will most
evidently appear, and needs no other to confirm it. However I doubt not
but that any one who should there lay a part of the said Ciiff shaped and mark∣ed
as he pleas'd for his own assurance, would find the same very hard Petri∣fy'd
in two or three Years, which may not be unworthy of farther Inquiry and
Trial for such as have opportunity.</P>
<P>As to the Proof of the sixth Proposition, it will not be difficult, the pre∣ceding
being once granted for that there may be thousands of Instances of that
Nature found in the Stones dug out of divers of our <HI>English</HI> Quarries; some
of which Stones are found full of such Petrifactions.</P>
<P>Upon this occasion I think it not improper to mention an Observation
which I have often taken notice of, which is of the Flints which are general∣ly
found intermix'd with Chalk in Quarries of that kind of Stone. I have
observ'd then that these Flints are nothing else but the Body of the Chalk u∣nited
together, and, as it were, first diluted by a petrifick Juice, and by that
dissolved into it, and so make a uniform close Body which by degrees doth all
petrify and harden together into that solid hard Body of the Flint. This I
found by taking notice of the Nature of those Flints when broken, and how
the Grain, Colour and Hardness of them was situated especially towards the
edges; for there where the Juice seem'd to be almost spent, the Flinty Body
appears of a midling Nature between Chalk and Flint, besides I have ob∣serv'd
sometimes other Bodies inclosed, and sometimes lumps of Chalk also,
toward which the Limb-parts of the Flint were coloured and terminated just
as towards the incompassing Chalk. And from the curious and sharp run∣ning
and mouldings which I have observed in Flints, I conceive that the first
Liquid Substance of it was altogether as fluid as Water, tho' it were imbu'd
with a Saline Sulphureous or other petrifactive Tincture. These Indications
may be much more plainly manifested by such a peice of Flint than 'tis pos∣sible
for any one to describe by words; and therefore I shall omit the farther
mention of them till I can meet with a Flint to shew them. I mention this
here only to shew that the petrifactive Juice is often found to insinuate itseif
into the closest Pores of Body, by reafon of its great fluidity which inables it
oft to petrify even the very Bodies and Substances of the Shells themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="316" MS="y"/>
But tho' some of these Petrifactive Liquors be thus fluid, yet they are not
all; and thence it comes that many Shells remain unpetrify'd, tho' the Sub∣stances
that fill'd them and enclos'd them be so wrote upon, which was the
seventh Proposition I undertook to prove. This I can make evident by di∣vers
of the Petrifactions that are kept in this Repository, and by thousands
of others which I have seen: And any one that will but diligently examine
them will find the very Shells themselves preserved Shells, tho' inclosed in
the middle of a Stone, as of <HI>Portland, Purbeck,</HI> and divers other Inland Stones
here dug in <HI>England.</HI> And I am promised to have sent me a flake of a Stone
which is very hard, which notwithstanding is all over full of Shells. I say
Shells, for that I cannot call them any thing else; since to all sensible trials
they are so, both as to Figure and Substance.</P>
<P>As to the Proof of the Eighth, I cannot produce a more pregnant one than
the <HI>Echinus</HI> or Helmet-Stone, found by Mr. <HI>William Ball</HI> upon the Shore of
<HI>Devonshire,</HI> near <HI>Exeter,</HI> which he presented to the Society, and I suppose
may yet be seen in the Repository, for by that alone it will plainly appear,
that there had been formerly a Shell that had caused both the formations of
the containing and contained Flint, there being just the due thickness of such
a Shell vacant between them, but there may be hundreds of others produced
of the like kinds if it were needful.</P>
<P>A Proof of the Ninth and Tenth, <HI>viz.</HI> I think the large <HI>Cornu Ammonis</HI>
may afford; for here it seems plain, that a great part of the Shell was wasted
away before the perfect Petrifaction of both the inclosing and inclosed Stone,
tho' part of the Shell be yet remaining sticking between them.</P>
<P>'Tis a hard matter to make a positive Proof of the Eleventh, <HI>viz.</HI> Because
of the infinity of them that would be necessary, yet I think it would not be
difficult to bring credible Testimonies enough to supply one for each Country,
and that I suppose may suffice to make it probable that they may be found in
all others, since, as I shall afterwards prove, they have been produced all by
the same cause.</P>
<P>As to the Twelfth Proposition which I undertook to prove, <HI>viz.</HI> That
most of those Shells or other Substances found as above, whether Petrify'd or
not Petrify'd, are in the first place differing from one another in many par∣ticulars
both of Figure and Substance, tho' yet they retain such particular
Characteristicks as are sufficient to denote and show to what Species they be∣long,
either of Vegetables or Animals, whether of Fishes or terrestrial Crea∣tures,
such as are now to be met with alive; that is, not only that such as
are thus found in one Country, are differing from those which are found in
another: And in Petrify'd ones this is not only remarkable in the Substance
inclosing and inclosed, but also in the magnitude, Figure and Make of the things
themselves; and in the second place many of them do considerably differ from
the shape of those Shell-Fishes, and other Substances which are now to be
found alive in such parts of the Seas as are nearest situated to the places where
these Fossil or Land Shells are now to be found. For the proof of which I
have no better means than to have recourse to the Substances themselves,
which have been so found, of which there is an excellent Collection in the
Repository of this Society, though I have also seen divers other instanccs in
other Collections and Observations which I have elsewhere met with, which I
cannot now produce. Yet one Instance for all I suppose may be this great
Voluta which I have here produced, that was taken out of a Quarry in <HI>Port∣land</HI>
(and I believe that those two other great ones in the Repository which I
begg'd of the late Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI> for the Repository are of the same kind
and from the same place) for by these I think it plainly enough appears, that
they are very differing from all the other Substances or particular Petrifactions
that are in the Repository, both in Magnitude, Colour, Shape and Substance
including and included, and even in the very Substance of that which I call,
and shall prove the Shell; and not only do they thus differ from the Petri∣factions
<PB N="338" REF="317"/>
Fossile or Land found Shells, but they differ also from all the known
sorts of Shells of that Species of Fishes, to which I would refer them, which are
now to be found any where near that place alive, nay, in any part of the
World that I yet knew of; notwithstanding all which, they do retain, I con∣ceive
certain Characteristicks of their Form, which show them to have be∣long'd
to that Species of Shell-Fishes which are call'd <HI>Nautili.</HI> These <HI>Nau∣tili</HI>
are describ'd by <HI>Gesner, Aldrovand, Johnston,</HI> and others, where you have
their Names and a Picture or two of the Shells, and some Stones also tend∣ing
to a Description of the Creature and two Species of them; but he that
shall think to find any such Characteristicks by reading their Descriptions and
seeing their Pictures of them, will be much mistaken. And indeed it is not
only in the description of this Species of Shells and Fishes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Defect of Natural Histo∣ry.</NOTE> that a very great
Defect or Imperfection may be found among Natural Historians, but in
the Description of most other things; so that without inspection of the things
themselves, a Man is but a very little wiser or more instructed by the History,
Picture, and Relations concerning Natural Bodys; for the Observations
for the most part are so superficial, and the Descriptions so ambiguous, that
they create a very imperfect Idea of the true Nature and Characteristick of
the thing described, and such as will be but of very little use without an o∣cular
Inspection and a manual handling, and other sensible examinations of the
very things themselves; for these are so many considerable Instances that
may by that means be taken notice of, which may be useful to this or that
purpose for which they may be instructive, that 'tis almost impossible for any
one Examiner or Describer to take notice of them, or so much as to have any
imagination of them. It were therefore much to be wishht for and indea∣voured
that there might be made and kept in same Repository as full and
compleat a Collection of all varieties of Natural Bodies as could be obtain'd,
where an Inquirer might be able to have recourse, where he might perufe,
and turn over, and spell, and read the Book ot Nature, and observe the <HI>Or∣thography
Etymologia, Syntaxis,</HI> and <HI>Prosodia</HI> of Natures Grammar, and by
which, as with a <HI>Dictionary,</HI> he might readily turn to and find the true Figure,
Cmposition, Derivation and Use of the Characters, Words, Phrases and
Sentences of Nature written with indelible, and most exact, and most expres∣sive
Letters, without which Books it will be very difficult to be thoroughly a
<HI>Literatus</HI> in the Language and Sense of Nature. The use of such a Collecti∣on
is not for Divertisement, and Wonder, and Gazing, as 'tis for the most part
thought and esteemed, and like Pictures for Children to admire and be pleased
with, but for the most serious and diligent study of the most able Proficient
in Natural Philosophy. And upon this occasion tho' it be a digression, I could
heartily with that a Collection were made in this Repository of as many va∣rieties
as could be procured of these kinds of Fossile-Shells and Petrifactions,
which would be no very difficult matter to be done if any one made it his care:
For <HI>England</HI> alone would afford some hundreds of varieties some Petrify'd,
some not. There are few Quarries of Stone here in <HI>England</HI> I believe, but if
they were look'd into some kind or other of these Petrifactions might be found
in them: I have observ'd them in Marbles almost of all varieties of Colours, as
Black, White, Red, and otherwise Speckled: I have seen them in great va∣rieties
of Flints and Pebbles, in various sorts of hard Stones, as <HI>Purbeck, Port∣land, Yorkshire, Kentish, Northamptonshire,</HI> &amp;c. I have seen many of them of
Coperose or Vitriol Stone, or <HI>Pyrites,</HI> and <HI>John Bauhine,</HI> and others have de∣scribed
many of them of that Nature. Others of these are, found above
Ground, and others also under Ground very deep▪ sometimes unpetrify'd and
remaining perfect Shells, Bones, Woods, Roots, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and have been found
by several sorts of trails to be truly so, not only in External Figure, but also
in the Internal and Substantial Parts of them; so that in truth there is no
manner of Reason to doubt them to be those very Substances they so per∣fectly
and fully resmble.</P>
<P>But if yet there should be some one that should make a doubt, of their iden∣tity
of sameness with such Substaces; as they seem to resemble I would wil∣lingly
know what kind of Proof will satisfie such his doubt, and by what Indi∣cations
or Characteristicks he will know a Shell of an unknown Species (<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or
<PB N="339" REF="318"/>
such may be shewn him) when it shall be presented to him, or a piece of
Wood of some strange Tree brought from an unknown place; if he will say
by the relation of the bringer, that I conceive is not becoming a good Na∣turalist;
and so one might have been impos'd on by the Relation of the in∣combustible
Linnen which was here examin'd; but if he will say by its Pro∣perties,
which he finds the same with that of shells, or Vegetables, or other
resembling Substances, then I answer, that the same will in these be mani∣festly shewn. Now, the more of these certain Characteristicks of the several
Species of Bodies there are known, the greater certainties and assurances will
be afforded by the artificial and strict Examination of them. As for instance,
the knowing the Existance and Form of the microscopical Pores of Wood, is
a better Characteristick to know that a Substance is Wood than the outward
Figure and Appearance thereof, which may be artificially or accidentally imi∣tated,
by which means I found that a peice ot Lignum Fossile sent from <HI>Ita∣ly</HI>
by Cavalier <HI>Pozzo</HI> to Sir <HI>George Eut.</HI> and by him supposed to be only Earth
shaped into that form and not to be real Wood, as <HI>Stelluti</HI> also indeavours to
prove. By the examination, I say, and discovery of the microscopical Pores
thereof with a Magnifying-Glass to be like those of Firr, I produced a better
Argument that it was really Firr than any <HI>Franciseo Stelluti</HI> has argued to
prove it Earth. Another was, that it burnt as Wood, and made Coles like
those of Wood, with microscopical Pores; had I had enough of it I could
have examin'd it by Distillation, and various other Chymical Probations; for
the more of Testi'monies and Confessions are fetch'd from these. Examinations
and Wracking, the greater will be the Evidence of the true Nature of those
Substances so examin'd, tho' oftimes the Evidence afforded by some one,
may be sufficient clearness to save all further Enquiries: such as these the
Lord <HI>Verulam</HI> call'd <HI>Experimenta Crucis,</HI> which serve to direct the Inquierer
to proceed the right way in making his Judgment. These are such marks as I
call Charasteristicks, which expresly determine, and limit the Nature and Spe∣cies
of the Body under Consideration. For Instance, I conceive that all those
Petrify'd Substances which are call'd Snake-stones in <HI>English,</HI> from some re∣semblance
imagin'd of a Snake coyled up; and in Latin (<HI>Cornu Ammonis,</HI> or
Sand Horns possibly from their being found in those Sandy Deserts.</P>
<P>These Petrifactions, I say, I conceive to be nothing else but the Petrifactions
of several sorts of Substances that the Shells of some sorts of <HI>Nantili</HI> happened
to be mix<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with, whilst those Substances were yet very soft and Liquid,
and before they came to be hardned into Stone by the Petrifactive Agent.
This Conception I grounded upon these Charactersticks, which in examining
a great many of them I have found. First, That in very many of them I have
manifestly seen the the real moulding Shell there preseved, together with
the moulded Substance.</P>
<P>Next I conceive, that this Shell did belong to the Species of the <HI>Nautili,</HI> or
sailing Fish, from these Characteristicks. First, That the Shell is of a true Co∣nical
Figure from the <HI>Base</HI> to the <HI>Apex.</HI> Secondly, That this Cone is turned
into a <HI>Voluta</HI> or Spiral Cone, so that the <HI>Azis</HI> thereof doth perfectly lye in
the same Plaine. Thirdly, That this Spiral being a true proportional Spi∣ral,
is continually at certain distances intercepted by Diaphragmes; so chat
those Diaphragmes being taken as Bases of severai Cones, the Cones shall be
found to diminish in a series Geometrically Proportional. Fourthly, That
every one of these Diaphragmes is perforated with a hole similar and pro∣portional
also according to a Geometical Series.</P>
<P>To these I might add other accidental Proprieties of the flating, crenating,
depressing, ridging, stringing, and the like, ornamenting, as it were, of the
outward sides of this voluted conical Body, and the undulation and soliation,
as I may call it, of the Diaphnagme, and the Fringing and Ruffling thereof;
all which are found of great variety in this or that Subalternate Species, as is
also the Section of the Base, or that of the Diaphragme; but these are not to
be looked upon as Characteristicks or Differences to denominate a new
Species.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="319"/>
And here by the bye I cannot but take notice of the imperfect and inaccu∣rate
Description of this so curious a Fish as the <HI>Nautilus</HI> must needs be, if one
May guess at the curiosity thereof from those descriptions, which I find in
<HI>Johnston</HI> out of <HI>Aristotle, Pliny, Bellonius, Piso, Cardan, Fauconerius,</HI> and others,
and from the curious make of the Shell, for by all those descriptions I cannot
imagine any one can get any tolerable Idea or Notion, what the make of so
wonderful a Fish must be that has such an admirable quality as to buoy him∣self
as <HI>Pliny</HI> says, <HI>ex alto mari</HI> from the bottom of the Sea, and make himself
to swim and sail upon the top of the Water, and at pleasure, or for fear pre∣sently
to sink himself down again to the bottom. This will appear so much
the more wonderful to one that shall consider the great pressure of the Wa∣ter
at the bottom of the Sea, and in how differing a state of compression this
Animal must be at those two places, and by what power it becometh able to
make itself so light at the bottom to rise and seem half out of the Water,
and yet presently so heavy as to sink down to the bottom, and this without
Finns or Tail to move itself. Now as this Property is peculiar to this Fish
only, so is the make of the Shell differing from all the Species of Nature be∣sides,
and as I conceive is the Engine by which he performeth this admirable
Exploit; for the whole Shell is divided into a multitude of Cells or Cabins
separated and distinguished one from another by several Diaphragmes or Par∣titions,
without any other perforation, save one small one, through which
passeth a small Pipe, which I take to be the Gut of the Animal; this Gut
doth not fill a two hundred part of the Cavity through which it passeth, and
the remaining part must either be filled with Air or Water. Now if it be
filled with Water, as probably 'tis, when he sinketh himself to the bottom,
'tis prety hard to conceive how he filleth it with Air under so great a pressure
and at such a distance from it as to buoy himself up, unless it be caus'd with
such a fermentation of the Excrements of the Gut, or other Juices of the Bo∣dy
as doth produce an artificial Air, which serves for that purpose; which
seems to me to be the true Cause, especially since I find <HI>Gulielmus Piso</HI> to
add this Remark to his History and Description of it. <HI>Cum damno meo Plinii
Discriptionem verissimam esse compertus sum namdum talem pisciculum</HI> (speaking
of the Nantilus <HI>of</HI> China) in mari captum imprudentius minibus meis contrectassem,
tantus and or manum invasit, tanquam sI aqua serventi suffusa esset, &amp; nisi apposito
statim allto conraso cum aquae mihi ipse subvenissem, procul dubio prae dolore in febrim
incidissem: Ʋnde ego ipsum pisem de Holothuriorum esse genere contenderim, ut que on∣nia
in maria stuctuantia, eam aerem calorem attrectantibus inurunt quod &amp; fallacissimi
omnium mortalium <HI>Chinenses</HI> noverunt, qui illa Orjzae miscent, ut liquorem suum
Destillatitium (quem Arac hos hic vocamus) tanto callidias reddant, perniczoso
invento, quod hinc miseri nostri Socii navales, sanguinis, sputam, phthisin, maras∣mum
deniq &amp; ipsam tandem mortem incurrant. By which it plainly appears, that
the Juices or Excrements of this Fish are of a strange fermenting or burning
Nature which may be the cause of so singular and wonderful an Indowment,
which whether it be so or not, I could heartily wish that some Person curious
in Anatony that has the opportunity of meeting with them alive would give
us a more accurate Description of its external and internal Formations and
Qualifications.</P>
<P>But to leave this Digression, which I have the longer insisted upon to shew
the great imperfections of the Descriptions of the Species of Nature and their
Qualifications and of the varieties of them (for that I have seen two Species
of this sort not described or mentioned in any Author) and of how great use
a good Collection, and Description of them would be, as particularly concern∣ing
this very Fish shall have occasion shortly to mention. To leave, I say,
this Digression, we may from this perceive how <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>little able we are from the
want of this Knowledge and Collection, to conclude, that because we do not
already know a Fish or Shell exactly of the shape of this or that <HI>Cornu Ammonus,</HI>
therefore that it could never have been any such Shell, since it then cannot
presently be proved that there is at present, or ever was any such Fish in be∣ing,
which some possibly too confident of their Omnisciency may Object, be∣cause
they know none such themselves, or have read of them; and therefore
that there is more reason that such Arguments as are drawn from the examina∣tions
<PB N="341" REF="320" MS="y"/>
of the Substances, and the Characteristicks of the Form should be of
sufficient evidence to evince that these Bodies that have these Qualifications
could not be formed but for such purposes, as those Animals which we are
informed of, we know have all parts fitted for each singular and surprizing use
designed; for it is certain that Nature doth nothing <HI>frustra,</HI> but manifestly
with an admirable and wise design, the truth of which Maxim will more and
more evidently appear, the more the Works thereof are curiously examined
and searched into; and no unprejudiced person that thoroughly examins them
can fail of being convinc'd of the Truth and Certainty thereof, there being
such a Harmony, Consent and Uniformity, as I may so speak, in all its O∣perations,
and a gradual transition from one to another, that it is evident
that all these kinds of Petrifactions have been moulded by some Animal or Ve∣getable
Substance, as by Shells, Bones, Teeth, Fruits, Woods, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
that many of them are the Substances themselves, yet unaltered.</P>
<P>Now this being proved or granted, which I conceive the inspection and
examination of the things themselves will most powerfully effect; it must
follow as a Consequence of that Phaenomenon, that all parts almost of the
present Earth extant and appearing above the Sea, have been for some con∣siderable
time under it, and covered therewith. Since I conceive there is
scarce any Country in the World where these Monuments of Antiquity, these
Medals of Nature, or these Sea Marks and Evidences are not to be found
either above, or at some depth under Ground, and some not very deep;
particular Testimonies of which Truth I have collected many out of the few
Natural Historians I have had the opportunity to peruse since I have had this
Notion; and I doubt not but that abundantly more may be collected even
out of Books. But inquisitive Natuarlists, if it were made an Head of In∣quiry,
would questionless meet with multitudes of other. Instances almost e∣very
where not as yet handed by any Historian, of which truth I have been
assur'd by many Testimonies from other Persons; but of this I have spoken
already sufficiently.</P>
<P>From the comparing of which Evidences with several other pertinent Cir∣cumstances
that may be observ'd may be deduced Conclusions very instructive
as to the preceding and subsequent State also of this World. <HI>Nam Res accent∣dunt
lumina Rebus,</HI> and the understanding the History of the Course and Pro∣gress
of Nature preceding will afford sufficient information of the Method of
preceding, which in most things we may find to be very constant, uniform
and regular. By such means we hive arriv'd to the present Knowledge of
Caelestial Motion, and by the like, to that we have of the Motions of the Seas
and Winds, and tho' none of these are yet come to their highest perfection,
yet Inquiry, and Ratiocination, and Comparison will carry us much further
towards that end, which the comparison of the present state thereof with
what it was two or three hundred Years since, will give us good reason to hope.</P>
<P>It remains then to inquire by what means these prominent Parts of the
Earth which at present are dry Land, came to be so, since by these Testimo∣nies
it is, evident that they have been for some time under the
Water.</P>
<P>And I are in the first place I think it will be evident,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This could not be from <HI>Noah</HI>'s Flood.</NOTE> that it could not be
from the Flood of <HI>Noah,</HI> since the duration of that which was but about two
hundred Natural Days, or half an Year could not afford time enough for the
production and perfection of so many and so great and full grown Shells,
as these which are so found do testify; besides the quantity and thickness of
the Beds of Sand with which they are many times found mixed, do argue.
that there must needs be a much longer time of the Seas Residence above the
same, than so short a space can afford.</P>
<P>Nor could they proceed from a gradual swelling of the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nor from a gradual swel∣ling of the Earth.</NOTE> from a Sub∣terraneous
fermentation, which by degrees should raise the parts of the Sea
above the Surface thereof; since if it had been that way, these Shells would
have been, found only at the top of the Earth or very near it, and not buried at
<PB N="342" REF="321" MS="y"/>
so great a depth under it as the Instances I mentioned of the Layer of Shells
in the <HI>Alps</HI> buried under so vast a Mountain, and that near the <HI>Needles</HI> in the
<HI>Isle of Wight</HI> found in the middle of an Hill, could not rationally be so
caused.</P>
<P>Nor could it proceed wholly from a washing of the Water from off the Face
of those parts ot the Earth, for the same Reason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nor from the washing away by the Water.</NOTE> for how should the Moun∣tain
come to be placed on the top of them.</P>
<P>Now, if after all these topicks of Proofs, there shall yet remain some who
will not allow any of them to have been Shells, because they are found in the
middle of Stone; I have, as a suppliment, added my Observation of the Place
where, and the Manner how they may be observ'd to be so inclosed, into the
Body of a solid Stone, namely, at a place near the, <HI>Needles,</HI> at the Weft end
of the <HI>Isle of Wight.</HI></P>
<P>With such now as shall not think all, or any of these convincing; Arguments
to prove them Shells, I cannot, I confess, conceive what kind ot Arguments
will prevail, since these sensible Marks are, in all other things, the Character∣iicksts▪
Proofs by which to determine of their Nature and Relation, and
why they should not be allow'd to be so in this particular Case I cannot well
conceive.</P>
<P>The great scruples I find are these;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The chief Ob∣jections.</NOTE> First, That they know not how they
could Come to be placed where they are and have been found; some Con∣jectures
at which I shall after shew.</P>
<P>And Secondly, That many, nay most, of them are of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> differing
Shape, and of a much greater Magnitude than are the Shell-Fishes of the
like Animals to be found upon the Coast of <HI>Portland,</HI> or near the places where
they hare been found; and indeed against this my Hypothesis or Assertion I
find none more pressingly urged than this, that there is not one to be found
either in the Seas near those Parts where such are found, nor in any part of
the known World, any such Animals or Vegetables as those which are sup∣posed
to have afforded the Substances of some of them, or the Moulds of some
other; and, particularly it has very much been urged upon the Consideration of
the Petrifaction or <HI>Cornu Ammonis</HI> taken out of the Quarry of Stone in the Isle
<HI>Portland,</HI> whether it could be reasonably supposed that ever there were in the
the World a Species of the <HI>Nautilus</HI> of this shape, and of so vast a bigness, of
which it is supposed the World has not afforded an equal in a living Species.
And I perceive that the very supposition is looked upon as very extravagant
and ridiculous. However, it may be possibly worthy some Mens Considera∣tions
to inquire, First, Whether there may not yet be found in the World
many Species of Shell-Fish they have not hitherto heard of, or seen in the
Writings of Natural Historians, or in relations of Voyages, or by their own
Experience.</P>
<P>Secondly, Whether the exceeding greatness of this Shell be a sufficient
Argument to conclude it ridiculous to suppose, that there could be a living
Fish that might fill so great a Shell, since I shew'd the last Day out of <HI>Maudelslo</HI>
and <HI>Olearius</HI>'s Travels, an instance of Oysters found in <HI>Java,</HI> that seem'd much
to exceed this Magnitude: And possibly some here present may have seen,
as well as my self, the great pair of Shells in the <HI>Musaeum Harveanum</HI> before
the Fire in 1666. And that the Shells of a <HI>Pinna Marina</HI> are now to be seen
in this Repository, which exceed the common bigness of a Muscle as much
as this <HI>Cornu Ammonis</HI> doth the smaller sorts of <HI>Nautili,</HI> and varieth also as much
from them in Shape: And that hotter Countries, such as are in the <HI>Torrid Zone,</HI>
produce Turtles or Sea Tortoises, abundantly more exceeding the smaller
sorts of these of colder Regions, of which there are Testimonies enough to be
had both from Natural Historians and Travellers, which it were necessary
I could produce.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="322" MS="y"/>
But because it may be upon this Head further Objected, That all those ex∣traordinary
great Species, are the productions of the <HI>Torrid Zone,</HI> or the hot∣ter
Climates, and not of the colder, and such as lie so far remov'd towards
the Poles as <HI>Portland</HI> or <HI>England</HI> do, about which there are now no living
Fishes to be found that any wise come near to that Magnitude, but are of
much smaller size and of different shapes.</P>
<P>Therefore before the Opinion be wholly rejected,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>That</HI> England <HI>lay formerly in the</HI> Torrid Zone, <HI>and was there cover'd with the Sea.</HI></NOTE> I would desire them to
consider, whether it may not have been possible, that this very Land of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
and <HI>Portland,</HI> did, at a certain time for some Ages past, lie within the
<HI>Torrid Zone▪</HI> and whilst it there resided, or during its Journying or Passage
through it, whether it might not be covered with the Sea to a certain height
above the tops of the highest Mountains. And further, how deep this may
have lain below the Surface of the Sea, when it might have been in that Pas∣sage,
and how long time it may have spent in such a state, and how long
since it may have been emerged. Such as are better versed in ancient Histo∣rians
than I ever have been or hope to be, may posibly resolve some of these
Doubts, or at least may prove the impossibility thereof, which may save fur∣ther
t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uble of inquiry: But if after inquiry it should be found that Natural
History is defective in that particular, then I will indeavour to see what Helps
and Histories will be pertinent towards the determination of these Queries.</P>
<P>And in order to determine the Possibility or Impossibility of this Matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Q. Whether the Ocean be every where equally distant from the Center.</NOTE> I
could wish it were well considered further, whether the Superficies of the O∣cean
be equally distant from a Central Point in the Bowels of the Earth, and
whether any other perpendiculars to the Surface thereof, besides those of every
single Parallel, and its Poles, do tend to any other Point of its Axis; and if
there should be found more than one Point, then what are the limiting or
rerminating Points of a Line of such Points; that is, at what distance they
must be from one another, or from a Central Point? This I mention'd in
two of my preceding Lectures, the one read about ten or twelve Years since,
and in the other about two Years since; in both which I indeavour'd to shew
that the form of the Earth was probably somewhat flatter towards the Poles
than towards the Equinoctial, since which I have met with some Observations
that do seem to make a probability in my Conjecture and Hypothesis.</P>
<P>The <HI>Antipodes</HI> were once thought a Chimera, length of time hath made that
notion more reconcileable to Sense and Reason; these may possibly at first
hearing appear much more extravagant, and Time that brings all to Light,
may possibly evidence them to be nothing but <HI>Chimaera</HI>'s; I will not pre∣judge,
nor pre-possess▪ but leave them to their Fortune. However it were
desirable by the Experience and Inquiry of a short time to dispatch and ha∣sten
the Growth and Ripenings of the Productions of Nature, since the Ex∣perience
and Duration of a Man, whether he looks forward or backward, is
very short in comparison of what seems requisite for this Determination; his
Sight is weak and dim, his Power and Reach much shorter, yet may it be
worth considering (tho' he cannot lengthen or prolong his limited time ei∣ther
past or to-come), whether by Telescopes or Microscopes he may not see
some hundreds of Years backwards and forward, and distinguish by such Mi∣croscopes
and Telescopes Events so far distant both before and behind himself
in time, as if close by, and now present? And whether by Instruments he
may not extend his Power, and reach things far above his Head, and far be∣neath
his Feet, in the highest parts of the Heavens, and the lowest parts of
the Earth; for could he perform things of this Nature and Quality as they
ought to be, he would lengthen his Life and increase the injoyments thereof
by a multiply'd and condens'd knowledge of times past, and of times also yet to come.</P>
<P>But before we come to this last Expedient, I could wish we had a good Ac∣count
and Collection of what Histories pertinent to this, or any other Na∣tural
Inquiry are to be found in Printed or Written Authors, which I
conceive is yet a <HI>Desideratum;</HI> and that this is possible to be so I shall menti∣on
one Observation, tho' not pertinent to this present Enquiry, yet to ano∣ther
which I have read formerly before this Society, <HI>viz.</HI> about the Chiness
Character and about the Chinese Printing. Inquiring then about <HI>Tartary</HI>
<PB N="344" REF="323"/>
and <HI>China,</HI> upon occasion of the Discourse that was here lately made, I found
that in <HI>Purchas</HI> his Pilgrims there is a part of the Works of <HI>Roger Bacon</HI> pub∣lish'd,
whereby I find that he so long since knew they had a way of Printing,
and had a better account of their Character than any one,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Page</HI> 58. <HI>Part</HI> 3.</NOTE> or all we have

note only by the bye, that both the <HI>Jugres</HI> and <HI>Cata<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans,</HI> those of <HI>Tebet</HI> and
<HI>Tangut,</HI> may be said to write all the same way with us, for that they differ
only in the Position of the Page as to the Eye when read or writ. Next, as
to the use of Printing, he says in the same Page, speaking of the Money of
the <HI>Cataians. Istorum Cataiarum moneta vulgaris est charta de hombasi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in qua im∣primunt
quasdam Lineas.</HI> This I suppose he took in part out of the Voyage of
<HI>Gulielmus de Rubriques,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Frier, who wrote an account of his Travels into
those Eastern Parts to the King of <HI>France,</HI> and for divers Reasons I believe
it to be a very true Relation, for I find in the thirty sixth Chapter of his Book
as follows. “The common Money of <HI>Cataia</HI> is Paper made of Bombast the
length of an Hand, upon which they imprint Lines, like the Seale of <HI>Man∣gu,</HI>
they write with a Pensil wherewith Painters Paint, and in one Figure
they make many Letters comprehending one word. The People of <HI>Thebet</HI>
write as we do, and they have Characters very like ours. They of <HI>Tangu</HI>
write from the right Hand unto the Left, as the <HI>Arabians,</HI> and multiply
the Lines ascending upwards.” <HI>Jugur,</HI> as aforesaid from above downwards.
This is very much the same with <HI>Roger Bacon,</HI> whereby we had above four
hundred Years since a hint of the Chinese Printing; as also that the Chinese
Characters were compounded of certain Elements, which expressed both a
literal and philosophical Word. I have one Observation more to add before
I leave this Digression, and that is in answer to another Objection which was
made against my Conjecture of the deducing the Name of <HI>Cornu Ammonis,</HI>
or Sand Horns from a probability that they might possibly be found in those
Sandy Deserts of <HI>Pentapolitana</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> now call'd <HI>Barca,</HI> which lieth West
of <HI>Egypt,</HI> between that and <HI>Afri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a Minor,</HI> almost opposite to the <HI>Morea</HI> of
<HI>Greece,</HI> a large and barren sandy Desert, troublesome to be travailed in, by
reason of the instability of the Footing, and for that the Sand is thrown
to and fro by the Wind, in the midst of which stood the Temple of <HI>Jupiter
Ammon</HI> whose Effigies was adorn'd with▪ Horns supposed to be Rams Horns, but
I conjectur'd they might possibly be the resemblance of those petrify'd <HI>Nautili,</HI>
found in that Sand. To this Conjecture I have only this to add, First, That
<HI>Lucan</HI> in the describing this Idol, calls him <HI>Corniger,</HI> which seems to argue,
that the Statue had Horns. But which seems more to agree with my Con∣jecture,
is what is related of the form of this Idol by <HI>Curtius,</HI> that it was
without the form of any Creature, but like a round Boss or Navel, (<HI>Ʋmbilicus</HI>
is the word) beset with Jewels; this was carried in Procession by the Priests in
a guilded Ship hung with Bells on both sides, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by which it should seem
that the very Idol itself was nothing but such a <HI>Nautilus</HI> Petrify'd, as I have
produced, beset round with Jewels for ornament, and carry'd in a Ship pos∣sibly
as a Hieroglyphick, to signifie the manner of some eminent Deliverance
of that Country from a former Flood, or the use of Ships in that place,
whilst an Island and that Desert was cover'd with Water. But this is only
Conjectural, which I submit to further examination.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="324"/>
But to leave this Digression and proceed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Searching of Natural Histo∣ries useful.</NOTE> I say, it were very desirable in
order to the solution of this and divers other Inquiries in Natural Philosophy;
that we had a Collection of Such Observations as are to be found, already
made and recorded in Natural Histories, to see what Light such Histories
would afford, which may be perform'd by the joint Labour of many Persons
who would peruse and collect such Matters; but possibly it may be believ'd
that little can be found pertinent to this Inquiry, as indeed I fear there will
be no great matter; yet <HI>Pliny</HI> in the tenth Chapter of his thirty sixth Book
takes notice of a matter which is not altogether impertinent, affirming, that
an Obelisk set up by <HI>Augustus</HI> for shewing the length of the Day, was found af∣ter
some time to go false.</P>
<P>But upon this I build no great matter, and I fear the ancient Observations
will in general help us no great matter, though they may give us cause of
suspicion, as particularly concerning the Latitudes of Places, of which Mr.
<HI>Vernon</HI>
takes notice that the present Latitude of <HI>Athens</HI> is near two degrees
differing from that assign'd it by <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> which is remarkable, it being of a
Place so eminently known in former Ages. But upon neither of these can
much be built as to the accuracy of determining such a motion; tho' they
may serve well enough for hints for Inquiry farther concerning them. Mon∣sieur
<HI>Pettit</HI> has also written a Treatise to prove that the Latitude of <HI>Paris</HI> is
differing from what it was formerly. <HI>Scaliger</HI> also had a notion of some such
matter, but I connot tell what he would have, nor do I believe he well knew
himself. The place is quoted in <HI>Chilmedes</HI> English Edition of <HI>Hues de Globis;</HI>
others also have mention'd it, but none have determin'd it or brought it to a
certainty. I did therefore upon this occasion, where I am discoursing con∣cerning
the general form and the proprieties or Motions of this great Body
of the Earth, think fit to insert it as a thing worthy of determination; since
'tis not improbable but that there may be some such motion of the Earths
<HI>Axis</HI> as may alter both the Latitudes of Places, and also the position of the
Meridional Line. And that this may not seem so absurd, we may consider the
alteration of the <HI>Axis</HI> of the Earth in respect of the fixt Stars long since dis∣cover'd,
and the variation of the magnetical <HI>Axis</HI> discover'd first about fifty
Years since by some of the Professors of this Colledge.</P>
<P>But now the Question is how these general Queries can be determin'd;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Some General Queries.</HI></NOTE>
that is, First, <HI>Whether there be any alteration of the gravitating Center of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Whether the Body of the Earth be of a true Spherical or Oval Figure,<MILESTONE N="2"/>

<P>THE beginning of this Lecture being lost I cannot certainly find when it was read,
but judge it preceeded that which I have here placed after it. It contains several
Positions to solve the Phaenomena before-mention'd relating to the great alterati∣ons
of the Figure and Motion of the Earth: Of these there are enumerated fifteen;
Tho' this be proposed only as an Hypothesis, yet the Author thinks it deserves examina∣tion
before it be wholly rejected, the discovery of Truth being his only aim: And adds,
That 1st. 'Tis not impossible for three Reasons. <HI>2dly.</HI> 'Tis no more Folly to invent
this Hypothesis, than 'twas to invent several others. 3<HI>d1y.</HI> 'Tis not only possible but

<CLOSER><SIGNED>R. W.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P><MILESTONE N="1"/>MY First Proposition then is this, That we should suppose First, That
this Globe or Ball of the Earth was carried round the Sun in the
plain of the Ecliptick, making an entire Revolution in that Plain once in
a twelvemonth, and thereby making the Sun to appear to pass continually in
the Ecliptick Line, as <HI>Pythagorus, Aristarchus Samius, Copernicus,</HI> &amp;c, have
supposed.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"/>Secondly, That this Globe or Ball whilst it maketh one such Revolution, is
likewise whirled round three hundred sixty and five times, and about ¼ upon
an <HI>Axis,</HI> or imaginary Line passing through, or near the Center thereof,
which <HI>Axis,</HI> is all the while kept in an Inclination to the said Plain of 23 ½.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3"/>Thirdly, That, this <HI>Axis</HI> doth continually keep a Parallelism to itself very
near; all which <HI>Axes</HI> at present respect a Point in the Heavens, not far di∣stant
from the last Star of the Tail of the little Bear call'd the <HI>Pole-star,</HI> but
heretofore 'twas at a greater distance from it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="4"/>Fourthly, That this <HI>Axis</HI> doth, in process of time, vary its respect to that
Star or Point of the Heavens, and by degrees proceed nearer towards it, not
directly, but in a Circle parallel to the Ecliptick, or whose Center is the Pole
of the Ecliptick. Thus far I take the same with the Hypothesis of <HI>Copernicus</HI>
and his Followers. But</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="5"/>Fifthly, I suppose yet further, that the <HI>Ax<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> of the
Earth hath also had a progressive motion, and hath, in process of time, been
chang'd in position within the Body of the Earth, and consequently that
the Poler points upon the Surface of the Earth, have alter'd their Situation;
so that the present Polar Points, have formerly been distant from those Poles
that were then; and consequently that those former Polar Points are now re∣mov'd
to a certain distance from the present, and move in Circles about
the present.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="6"/>Sixthly, I suppose that the Form of the Surface of the Water at least, is,
and hath been, ever since the duration or the Earth, or an <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al Form,</HI> whose
longest Diameters lye in the Plain of the Equinoctial, and whose shortest is
the <HI>Axis</HI> itself of the said Rotation.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="7"/>Seventhly, As a Consequent of this I suppose the Center of <HI>Gravity</HI> of the
Earth to be drawn out into a Line into the <HI>Ax<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> thereof, and consequently in∣to
infinite Centers, there being one for every Parallel Line upon the Surface
of the Earth, and that no perpendiculars but those of the Poles and Aequi∣noctial,
respect or tend directly to the Central Point, but that all the Per∣pendiculars
from the other Parallels respect certain Points in the opposite
Parts of the <HI>Axis</HI> which are so much the further remov'd from the Center, by
<PB N="347" REF="326"/>
how much the nearer the Parallels approach the Polar Points; which Points
of Gravitations and Position of Perpendiculars in respect of the <HI>Axis,</HI> may
be determin'd both <HI>a Priori</HI> by Theory, and also <HI>a Posteriori</HI> by Experiments
or Observations.</P>
<P>Eighthly, As a Consequent of these, I suppose, that in process of time<MILESTONE N="8"/>
there will be caused an alteration of the gravitating Power and Tendency of
the Parts of the Earth, both Solid and Fluid, and that according as the Posi∣tions
of them are alter'd in respect of the Polar Points, either present Pre∣cedent
or Subsequent, there will be caused in the</P>
<P>Ninth Place, an indeavour of sliding, subsiding, sinking and changing of the<MILESTONE N="9"/>
Internal Parts of the Earth, as well as External, tho' the latter will be more
powerful, as being more affected by the Rotation thereof; and this may cause
in the</P>
<P>Tenth Place, an alteration in the Magnetical Power and Vertue of the Bo∣dy<MILESTONE N="10"/>
of the Earth, especially of such Parts as are more loose and of a more
fluid Nature. And</P>
<P>In th Eleventh Place, may be a cause also of some of those <HI>Tremores Terr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI><MILESTONE N="11"/>
or Earthquakes which have in all Ages been in the Earth, tho' we have no
Histories or Records that have preserved the Memory of them, but only such
Signs and Monuments as they have left by the unequal ragged and torn Face
of the Surface of the Land and the Bodies that are discovered; which proves
that they had some time an other Position than they are found to have at the
present.</P>
<P>These two last notwithstanding I do not suppose the only causes of these
Effects of Earthquakes, no nor the Principal, but only as concurring and ad∣juvant
Causes which may have their Effects in some measure, but how far and
how powerful they may be supposed, will be proper to be resolved under
the Heads of Magnetisms and Earthquakes, and more especially under
that of the Air. The same Principles or Suppositions will also produce in
the</P>
<P>Twelfth Place; a more than ordinary swelling or rising of the Sea in those<MILESTONE N="12"/>
Parts which are near the Aequinoctiai, and a sinking and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>eding of the Sea
from tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which are near the Poles; so that as any Parts do increase in
their Latitudes, so will the Sea grow shallower, and as their Latitudes de∣crease,
so must the Sea swell and grow high; by which means many subma∣rine
Regions must become dry Land, and many other Lands will be overflown
by the Sea, and these variations being slow, and by degrees will leave very la∣sting
Remarks of sush States and Positions, in the superficial Substances of
the Earth.</P>
<P>And hence also will follow in the Thirteenth Place, a great alteration and<MILESTONE N="13"/>
variety of the Productions of those Parts which are thus alter'd in their Posi∣tion,
whether they are parts of the Sea or parts of the Land; for as there
seems to be somewhat which is peculiar to this or that Soyl or Spot of Land
whereby this or that Animal or Vegetable doth grow and thrive and increase
both in Quantity and Quality, and the contrary: So is there also somewhat
in the Climate and Position to the Sun and Heavens, which doth as power∣fully
at least, if not much more, affect the Productions, Propagations, &amp;c. of
Plants and Animals. And as 'tis a known Observation, that in the same
Country, this or that Field, or Soil is more effective or this or that use; so
'tis as well known that the transplanting of animate Subjects to differing Cli∣mates,
tho' the Soil seems of the same Nature, doth as effectually co-operate
in the changing or alteration of them. And hereby a fruitful Land may be
turned into Barrenness, and be made unfit for Production as well as Barren
and Useless may be made Fruitful; for that the Temper and Constitution of
a Soil may be such as to be fit for many purposes in some Climates, which in o∣thers
is fit for nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="327"/>
<MILESTONE N="14"/>From hence also will follow in the Fourteenth Place, That many places
which by degrees are made Submarine, will be cover'd with various Coats or
Layers of Earth; so that the former Surface of it, when Land will not only
be drown'd with Water, but buried under Earth; for that, as the parts of
the Land, are continually washed down; and by the Rivers carried into the
Sea, and there deposited in the Submarine Regions, so much more power∣fully
and plentifully are the higher parts of the Submarine Regions by Tides,
Currents, and other Agitations of the Water, removed and transported, into
the lower, partly by sinking out of the muddy Water, but principally by
tumbling and rowling down from the higher, which sorts of covering or
burying Earth must be posited in certain Layers or Stratifications of divers
kinds of Substances according to the nature of those which are this or that
way brought thither, and there deposited. Hence also it will follow, that the
Earth itself doth, as it were, wash and smooth its own Face, and by degrees
to remove all the Warts, Furrows, Wrinckles and Holes of her Skin, which
Age and Distempers have produced.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="15"/>And hence in the Fifteenth Place will follow, That such Regions as have
for a time been Submarine, and produced Substances of Animals or Vege∣tables
proper for them, when they come to be dry Land and to lye above the
Waters, must produce Animals and Vegetables proper and peculiar to that
Soil, Element and Climate they are then furnish'd with; preserving in the
mean time the Characteristicks and Marks of the former Qualifications, when
in another Condition.</P>
<P>But some possibly may be ready to say before a thorough examination, that
this is only a supposition, and that there are no such Phaenomena as here are
put for the Supposition: Others, that 'tis foolish to make an Hypothesis for
the solving of any one Phaenomenon. Others may possibly demand how
comes this to be now discover'd, which none hath hitherto known? Or how
is this to be proved? By what History? By what Signs and Tokens? I must
leave every one to his own freedom to judge as he sees cause, and censure as
he picases; however, I conceive it <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> easy to play the
Momus or the Mimick. <HI>Sed si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uis quid rectius islus a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>andidus <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mper<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</HI>
But if he know better let him not, hold his Tongue but tell us. I
shall not impose on any; I propound it only as an Hypothesis, and have
shewed what will be the Consequences of it, whether there be Phaenomena
answerable to be observ'd let it be examin'd; and let there be produce'd
another Hypothesis that will solve the various Phaenomena that are to be
every where met with better; for that I have no farther design in propound∣ing
it than to have it strictly examin'd, and in order thereunto to have such
Observations made and taken notice of for the future as may ascertain the
Truth whether for or against it.</P>
<P>Yet give me leave to add a word or two, before I wholly leave it to its Fortune.</P>
<P>First then,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The supp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. not impos∣sible.</HI></NOTE> I say, That what is here supposed in not impossible. First, 'Tis
not impossible from the Natural History now to be met with of the things
supposed; for that all things may be the same as they now appear, and yet
this may be true; for no one Phaenomenon, that I can think, of, is contradict∣ed
by it, either fetch'd out of ancient Histories, or yet Collected by present
Observation. As there are no Observations of Latitudes, or fixed, accurate
meridian Lines, or Eclipses for the Oval Shadow of the Earth, or Mensura∣tion
of Degrees to find their difference in differing Latitudes. Nor Secondly,
Is it impossible from the Nature of the things supposed, for that there is as
yet no certain Cause assigned, why the Earth doth move upon the <HI>Axis,</HI> it
now doth, and not upon another, nor why it should always continue and re∣main
the same without change, contrary to all other motions in Nature. Nor
is it impossible because not discover'd before, which yet is more than can be
positively proved; for if so, then would Magnetical Motions fall under the
same Censure, as also, Optick-glasses, Guns, Printing, and other new dis∣coveries.
<PB N="349" REF="328" MS="y"/>
And by the same Argument the Motion of the Sun, and <HI>Jupiter</HI>
upon their Axes, the Reality and Revolution of the Satellites of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and
<HI>Saturn,</HI> the Ring of <HI>Saturn</HI> and the Belts of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and the like might be con∣demned.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2dly, <HI>Notridiculous.</HI></NOTE> I say for it, that 'tis no more folly to invent new Hypotheses to
solve Phaenomena in the Earth, than it was in <HI>Pythagoras, Ptolomy, Copernicus,
Ticho, Kepler,</HI> and others in the Heavens; for that each of them conceiv'd
by such Hypotheses to solve the Phaenomena more agreeably to the other ap∣pearances
of Nature; whereas yet no one of them has hit the right I conceive,
and I shall, I hope, in due time demonstrate.</P>
<P>But in the Third Place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3dly, <HI>'Tis pro∣bable.</HI></NOTE> for Affirmative, I say, 'tis not only possible, but
probable, and altogether consonant and agreeable to the rest of the Works
of Nature, and even to the very Constitution and Phaenomena to be observ'd
upon the Earth itself.</P>
<P>And First for the <HI>Oval Figure of the Sea and Body of the Earth in some mea∣sure.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Oval Figure of the Earth.</NOTE>
If the gravitating Power of the Earth be every where equal, as I know
no reason to suppose the contrary, then must this Power be compounded with
a contrary indeavour of heavy Bodies to recede from the Axis of its Motion,
if it be supposed to be mov'd with a diurnal Revolution upon its Axis, and
consequently a part of the gravity of such Bodies towards the Center must be
taken off by this <HI>Conatus,</HI> which is every where oblique, but only under the
Aequinoctial, which must therefore most diminish its Gravitation, and con∣sequently
the gravity will act the most freely and powerfully under the Poles;
and the more powerfully the nearer the Bodies are plac'd to those Poles,
and that Phaenomena do answer to this Theory, has been verify'd, first by Mr.
<HI>Hally</HI> at St. <HI>Helena,</HI> and since by the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Cayen,</HI> and now lately in <HI>Siam,</HI>
in all which places it is affirmed, that 'twas necessary to shorten the Pendulum
to make it keep its due Time.</P>
<P>In the Second Place for the <HI>variation of the Axis of Rotation</HI> in the Body of
the Earth.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the varia∣tion of the Axis.</HI></NOTE> I say it is consonant to all the other motions of Nature: For
first it is found that the <HI>Axes</HI> of the <HI>Ellipses</HI> of the Planets do vary a little, I
say a little (tho' Mr. <HI>Street</HI> only will have them not to vary at all) because all
Astronomers have hitherto affirmed, that they do, and from my own Ma∣thematical
Hypothesis I collect the same, tho' it be but a little, yet it is some∣what,
since there is some impediment in the Medium. Next there is also
a motion in the Nodes, all which are very eminent in the Moon. And a∣gain,
the direction of the <HI>Axis</HI> in the Earth is varied as to its respect to the
Heavens, which the precession of the Aequinoxes do manifest. Nay yet fur∣ther,
the <HI>Axis</HI> of the Magnetical Motions which is within the very Body of
the Earth, and seems even to go through its very Center, hath, about fifty
Years since, been prov'd to vary also somewhat analogous to this which I have
supposed, whereby both the Magnetical Latitudes, and Magnetical Meridi∣ans
have most certainly been varied; which seems abundantly more difficult
to be granted than this which I propound, did not certain Observations
both here at home and all over the World confirm the truth of Matter of
Fact, and that because this doth seem to prove a motion of a Magnetical
Core or Magnetical Globe of the Earth, within this outward earthy and wa∣tery
Shell; whereas this which I suppose is nothing but a progression of the
<HI>Axis</HI> of Rotation, which may be caus'd by the visible accidental Mutations of
the outward and superficial Parts, as well as by other unknown alterations
which may succeed within the Bowels of the Earth. So that 'tis very pro∣bable
that there is some such motion of the said <HI>Axis,</HI> since we are certain
both of outward and inward changes.</P>
<P>It only remains then Positively and Experimentally, or Historically to prove
the Reality thereof. Now the motion of the Mutation thereof being but
slow, as I conceive, and the Observations of the Antients Recorded in Hi∣stories
necessary for this purpose, being so unaccurate and uncertain for such
a determination as this, I fear they cannot be rely'd upon; but whatever
shall be alledg'd as a proof of this Theory, will be attributed to a fault in the
Antient Observation, as that <HI>Ptolomy</HI> puts the Latitude of <HI>London</HI> 52 10
and the longest Day 17 Hours. Nor will I insist on the Latitude of <HI>Athens</HI>
<PB N="350" REF="329"/>
found by Mr. <HI>Vernon,</HI> to differ near a Degree: Nor on the Latitude Of the
<HI>Herculean Streights,</HI> which varies as much from the present, as that of <HI>London,</HI>
tho' all these were remarkable places, as was also <HI>Constantinople;</HI> but rather re∣ly
upon Observations to be made for the future; the way of performing
which I shall treat of hereafter, whereby I shall shew, how, in a short time,
the same thing may be determin'd as well as by so long a time.</P>

<P>WHat I propounded the last Day by way of an Hypothesis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suppositions as extravagaut have been made.</NOTE> may possibly
be look'd upon not not only as very extravagant, but very improb∣able;
from the last of which I hope I did then clear it; and as to its extra∣vagancy,
I hope I may be able to shew, that there have been suppositions al∣together
as extravagant, which yet have not only been made, but accepted
and imbraced, and for many Ages as stifly defended as the most probable.
My Instance shall be in the <HI>Ptolomaick,</HI> Hypothesis of the Heavens, which,
that you may the better judge of, I have here a Book to shew the whole
Design and Intrigue of it, in which the same and all its parts are most curi∣ously
delineated, whereby all the Wheel-work may be at once discover'd;
and if it be desir'd to be made in Clock-work, I have another Author that shall
give the bigness of the Wheels, and the number of the Teeth and Pinions
necessary to accomplish the same in Clock-work: And yet when all is done,
there will want as many more to make out all the irregularities of appear∣ances
exact; the reason of which proceeded from one false Principle, that one
Body was capable▪ of no more than one simple motion, whereas in truth there
is no body mov'd but is capable of, nay, actually mov'd by thousands.</P>
<P>But it may possibly be said that this <HI>Hypothesis</HI> was the Product of an Age
not so inquisitive and able to judge as the present, which will hardly be im∣pos'd
on with such improbabilities; nor was all this clutter thought neces∣sary
at first, but the maintainers of that Opinion, to make out the appear∣ances,
as well as they could, have since found it necessary to help out the first
Invention by additional Expedients; and if these were sufficient, I conceive
it might yet be an acceptable <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> tho' we have no <HI>Medium</HI> to prove
that there is any such thing in Nature as a <HI>Solid Orbe,</HI> or a moving <HI>Genius.</HI></P>
<P>The like favour I hope may be allow'd to what I propound, if upon due ex∣amination
the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> are answerable to what the <HI>Hypothesis</HI> does hint.</P>
<P>Now what would be consequential to what I have propounded, I shew'd the
last Day; it only now remains to examine whether Phaenomena do answer.</P>
<P>First then to determine whether the Figure of the Sea from North to South
be Oval,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st. <HI>of the Figure of the Sea.</HI></NOTE> swelling towards the Aequinoctial and depress'd towards the Poles,
it will be necessary to make some few Trials, Observations and Experiments.</P>
<P>And First for Experiments that may be made here.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Experiments to prove it.</HI></NOTE> Let a Bowl or Bubble
of Glass be made and melted in a Lamp, and when so melted let it be blown
into a hollow Ballor Bubble, which will naturally form and Shape itself into a
round and spherical Body, especially if the Substance be of an equal thick∣ness
and equal heat, which let be examin'd; then let the same be melted
again as before, and as it is blowing, let it be mov'd round upon the Pipe, by
<PB N="351" REF="330"/>
which it is blown, by a pretty quick Circular Motion, and you will find that
instead of the Spherical Figure it will receive an Oval one, such as I suppose
the Surface of the Sea to have. This Experiment I shall by and by shew here
(which was accordingly done).</P>
<P>Now in this Experiment here are evidently two kinds of Powers that coope∣rate
in the production of this Form. The first is that of the Congruity of the
Matter, which, as I have many Years since in a small Treatise, Printed in
the Year 1660, proved, doth shape the Glass into a true Spherical Figure,
and so maketh every part to indeavour towards the Center of the whole.
The next is that of the vertiginous Motion, which giveth to every part, an
indeavour to recede from the <HI>Axis</HI> of the vertiginous Motion; this driveth
the shape of the whole into that Oval Form it receiveth and retaineth.</P>
<P>The same Experiment may be much better made at the Glass-house, where
a greater quantity of Glass may be melted, and that more equally and a
quicker Motion may be given, which will make the Experiment the more
sensible, the Glass retaining its melted heat much longer. Besides, it may
be there tried with a solid lump of Glass which will receive the same Figure
from a vertiginous Motion about the Puntilion. And again, to make the
Glass Oval the other way, the same is whirled round with a motion where∣in
the Puntilion is made the Radius of the vertiginous Motion.</P>
<P>A second Experiment to shew that the Water doth naturally recede from
the Poles towards the Aequinoctial is this. Take a round Dish of Water,
and let it be set upon a Stand where it may be gently mov'd round upon an
an Axis passing through the Center of the Dish perpendicularly; first observe
the Surface of the Water when it stands still without motion, there you find
it smooth aud horizontal; then move the stand gently round by degrees, till
you find the Water begins to receive the motion of the Dish; then examine
the Surface thereof and you will perceive the Water to sink in the middle,
and to recede and swell towards the Circumference of the Dish: And the
better to satisfie you I have prepared the Experiment which I will by and by
shew. The Experiments are plain and common, yet I humbly conceive not
less instuctive to the present Controversy, than the most pompous and more
chargeable Experiments.</P>
<P>This last Experiment doth hint, that the Convexity of the Sea near the
Poles of the Earth must necessarily be much flatter than elsewhere,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Superfi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Sea next the Poles pos∣sibly Concave.</HI></NOTE> and not
only less Spherical than the rest of the Sea, but possibly plain, nay, beyond
a plain, possibly Concave, for that the Water cannot but have or receive from
the vertiginous Motion, an endeavour to recede from the Center of that
Motion, and the Gravity of the Earth working there more powerfully and
freely. But this only by the bye. But which seems more material, I con∣ceive
that a Degree of Latitude, if there measured would be very much long∣er
than a Degree of Latitude under the Aequinoctial, of which I shall speak
more by and by.</P>
<P>In the next place then we are to consider what other Observations and Tri∣als
will serve to the direct and positive proof of this <HI>Hypothesis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Observations to prove the The∣ory.</NOTE> <HI>That the Figure
of the Earth is that of a prolated Sphaeroide, not of an oblong Sphaeroide, nor of a Sphaere.</HI>
And those may be ranged under two Heads, First, Such as are consequential
Proofs drawn from the similitude in Nature's Operations, on other Bodies
similarily affected. And Secondly, Those which more immediately and po∣sitively
prove the Effects thereof upon the very Body of the Earth itself.</P>
<P>The first sort of Observations are to be fetch'd from the Caelestial Bodies,
such as we are assur'd by Observation have a vertiginous Motion about their
Axis, as Hypothetically only we suppose the Earth to have; such are the Body
of the Sun Primarily and Principally, which was discover'd by <HI>Galileo,</HI> and
prov'd and perfected by <HI>Scheiner;</HI> next the Body of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> which was first
found to move about its own Axis, in the Year 1664, and which has since
been perfected by <HI>Cassini.</HI> Now, if by exactly examining the true Diameters ot
the Sun when we are in the plain of its Aequinoctial (which is in the beginning
of <HI>June</HI> and of <HI>December,</HI>) if I say by Trial, we find that the Diameter <HI>per Axin</HI>
of the Sun is shorter than the Diameter of its Aequator, then there will be a
<PB N="352" REF="331"/>
further probability that the like may be in the Earth if it be so mov'd, as is
now generally supposed: The liketrial may be made of the like Axis of <HI>Jupiter</HI>
though the Trials will be therein more difficult, as being much less sensible,
from the smallness of the Difference; however 'tis worth examining, as it will
be to examine also the Diameters of <HI>Mercury</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI> when they pass un∣der
the Sun, tho' we are not yet assur'd of their vertiginous Motion, and if
Mons.<HI>Gallets</HI> Observation may be credited, such a <HI>Phaenomenon</HI> was taken no∣tice
of by him in the late transit of ☿ <HI>Sub Sole,</HI> as appears by his account of
the Passage of ☿ <HI>Sub Sole,</HI> Printed in a Treatise by itself, and in the Journal
<HI>des Scavans.</HI> Now, if this Observation do answer in the Diameters of the
Sun, it will afford us also a further information of the Nature of that Glorio∣us
Body, and will, I conceive, prove it to be of a fluid and yielding Substance,
especially the shining and superficial parts thereof. Trial also may
be made of the like Diameters of the <HI>Moon,</HI> tho' her vertiginous Motion in
comparison of her bulk, be the slowst of all we yet know as turning round
on her Axis but once in a Month. The like may be made of the Body of <HI>Sa∣turn,</HI>
when the Ring is so posited as that the Diameters that lye in the longer
and shorter Diameters of the Ring may be plainly discover'd; what the rea∣son
of that Ring may be I shall discourse of elsewhere. These I suppose
will be the easiest and soonest made, and if judiciously and accurately per∣form'd,
with a due regard of Refraction, and the true position of the Axis,
will give a great probability or improbability to this supposael, but still I confess
it will afford no more than a probable Argument either for or against it:
However, that probability being very great, and the trial not very difficult; it
will be well to make the Observations, especially those of the Suns Diameter,
with all imaginable accurateness, which may be done to a very great one, if
there be fit Instruments and sufficient Care used therein, so as very many
times to out strip all that I have hitherto met with of that kind, the whole
method of which will be too long and tedious now to explain; however, if I
can procure Assistance, I resolve to try it this following <HI>June,</HI> which is much
the best time of the whole Year to avoid the inconveniency of Refractions,
and the true Phaenomena thereof I will produce here, without being biassed
for this Hypothesis, for which I have no further concern than as it shall be
found agreable to the truth of Appearances. Now, tho' I confess also,
that I cannot expect that the difference of the longer Diameter in the Sun
from the shorter will be very much in regard of the very strong power of Gra∣vity
in that Glorious Body whereby it is able to detain all the planetary
Bodies in their Orbs from running from him, and even that of <HI>Saturn</HI> so vast∣ly
remov'd; yet when I compare that with the Magnitude of its Body, and
the time of its Rotation, I am apt to think that accurate Trials may dis∣cover
some sensible difference, which I must leave to Trial.</P>
<P>The second sort of Observations or Trials necessary to prove this Hypo∣thesis,
which are direct and positive, and may be truly call'd <HI>Experimenta
Crucis,</HI> according to the Lord <HI>Verulam</HI> are principally two, which are sufficient
to prove it thoroughly, tho' the other should fail; the first is to procure an
exact trial to be made of the Time that a Pendulum Clock will keep under or
near the Aequinoctial, which is adjusted exactly to the time by the Sun or
Stars in a much greater Latitude; or the trial of such a Clock in two places
very much differing in Latitude after the Clock hath been exactly adjusted in
time, to one of those places; because such a difference if it be found and de∣termin'd
will be of sufficiency to determine the proportional co-operation of
these two Powers. As for instance, this may be sufficiently examin'd by a
Clock adjusted in <HI>England,</HI> and tried in the <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> if Care and Accurate∣ness
be used in both these places, which I conceive might be easily procur'd by
the Favour and Assistance of this Honourable Society. The second which is
a much more difficult Experiment, but yet much more positive and convincing
than any other, is the measuring of the quantity of a Degree of Latitude
upon the Earth, in two places very much differing in Latitude; the one as
near as might be towards the Pole, as upon the Ice in the <HI>Finntek Gulf,</HI> as Mon∣sieur
<HI>Thevenot</HI> proposeth, which might be procur'd by Mr. <HI>Hevelius</HI> at <HI>Dant∣zick,</HI>
or Dr. <HI>Rudbeck</HI> at <HI>Stockholm</HI> in <HI>Sweedeland,</HI> who might do it himself or
<PB N="353" REF="332"/>
procure it to be done at the North end of that Gulf, which would be yet bet∣ter,
and by some Persons in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> or other parts nearer the <HI>Aequator.</HI>
These last trials, if accurately made, would be undeniable Proofs of this sup∣position,
if it should be certainly found that a Degree in the more Northern
Countries were more large than a Degree in the more Southern Climate, and
the Experiment with the Pendulum Clocks would likewise more exactly ad∣just
the true Gravity of the Earth consider'd simply without the compositi∣on
of the vertiginous Motion. And thus much for the first part of the Hy∣pothesis,
that the Figure of the Water above the Earth is that of a prolated
Sphaeroeid whose shortest Diameter is that of the Axis of its Rotation.</P>
<P>Next for the examination of the second Part thereof (namely, whether the
Axis of its Rotation hath and doth continually by a slow progression,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>2dly,</HI> Of the alteration of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Axis of the Earths Ro∣tation.</NOTE> vary its
Position with respect to the Parts of the Earth; and if so, how much, and
which way, which must vary both the Meridian Lines of Places, and also
their particular Latitudes) it had been very desireable, if from some Monu∣ments
or Records of Antiquity, somewhat could have been discover'd of cer∣tainty
and exactness, that by comparing that or them with accurate Obser∣vations
now made, or to be made, somewhat of certainty of information could
have been procur'd: But I fear we shall find them all insufficient in accurate∣ness
to be any ways relied upon; however, if there can be found any thing
certain and accurately done, either as to the fixing of a Meridian Line on
some Building or Structure now in being, or to the positive or certain Lati∣tude
of any known place, tho' possibly those Observations or Constructions
were made without any Regard or Notion of such an Hypothesis, yet some of
them compared with the present state of things might give much Light to
this Inquiry. Upon this account I perus'd Mr. <HI>Graves</HI> his Description of the
great Pyramid in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> that being Fabl'd to have been built for an Astro∣nomical
Observation, as Mr. <HI>Graves</HI> also takes notice. I perus'd his Book I
say, hoping I should have found, among many other curious Observations be
there gives us concerning them, some Observations perfectly made, to find
whether it stands East, West, North and South, or whether it varies from
that respect of its sides to any other part or quarter of the World, as like∣wise
how much, and which way they now stand; but to my wonder, he be∣ing
Astronomical Professor, I do not find that he had any regard at all to the
same, but seems to be wholly taken up with one Inquiry, which was about
the measure or bigness of the whole and its parts, and the other matters
mention'd, are only by the bye and accidental, which shews how useful The∣ories
may be for the future to such as shall make Observations; nay, tho'
they should not be true, for that it will hint many Inquiries to be taken no∣tice
of which would otherwise be not thought of at all, or at least but little
regarded, and but superficially and negligently taken notice of. I find in∣deed,
that he mentions the South and North sides thereof, but not as if he
had taken any notice whether they were exactly facing the South or North,
which he might easily have done. Nor do I find that he hath taken the ex∣act
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>titude of them, which methinks had been very proper to have been
retain'd upon Record with their other Description. [Here by the bye be∣cause
it agrees with a former Conjecture, I here proposed, concerning
those stupendious Works, namely, that the Core of them was probably some
natural Rock cut and shaped fit to be cased or cover'd with another sort of
Stone, which was at that time much contradicted, by Affirmations, that the
whole Country and Place of their Station was nothing but Sand. Give me
me leave to take notice that Mr. <HI>Graves</HI> doth affirm, That the great Pyramid
is founded upon a natural Rock which riseth above the rest of the Sand, and
that the Rooms about the second Pyramid are hewen and shapen out of the
natural Rock; and I doubt not but that if they were all examin'd, they would
be found to be so and nothing else, which would much alleviate the stupen∣dious
Labour and Work of Men that must otherwise have been supposed to
be made use of; but this only by the bye.] To proceed then where
I lest, I say that I conceive it were very desirable for the future, that those I
have mention'd, and several other particular Observations, were purposely
<PB N="354" REF="333" MS="y"/>
made for that such would give a great light to judge and make a true valu∣ation
of the State and Nature of places and things, which in most Descrip∣tions
we find altogether wanting. As among many other things I could hint,
I should be very glad to find such a Description of the Nature of the Sand of
those Parts as would inform me whether it have not been all a Sea-Sand: I
say, not only of this Country of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> which is so exceeding plain, and so
exceeding Sandy, with many cragged Rocks rising out of it; but of <HI>Arabia
Deserta,</HI> and <HI>Arabia Petraea,</HI> and all the parts near the <HI>Tigris</HI> and <HI>Euphrates,</HI>
and all the parts on this side of <HI>Egypt,</HI> as the Region of <HI>Barca</HI> and <HI>Pentapoli∣tana,</HI>
and many other which are said to be all smooth and cover'd with Sand;
for Observations designedly made, would easily discover whether such Sands
had been owing to the Sea, or to some other Cause, which, by some curious
Observations I have met with in the Travels of <HI>Peter de la Valle</HI> and <HI>Belloni∣us,</HI>
and others, I judge they have. I shall here present you with one of
them. <HI>Pietro della Valle parte terza Lettera</HI> 11da <HI>d' Aleppo</HI> Aug. 5. 1625.
<HI>Vidi per terra molte Conchiglie marine, lustre dentro comme Madre Perle, parte in∣tere,
e parte spezzate, che in Luogo tanto lontano dal mare mi marvigliai come
potessero trovarsi, vidi anco sparsi per tutto molti pezzi di Bitume, che in quell terre∣uo
salmastro, e che in qualche tempo dell anno per allagarsi d' acqua si genera, del
quali ne presi e tengo mostra appresso di me.</HI> NB. This Place is betwixt <HI>Bassora</HI>
and <HI>Aleppo,</HI> in the Deserts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> fourteen Days Journey from the Sea.</P>
<P>In <HI>English</HI> thus, “I Saw on the Ground many Sea-Shells shining within like
Mother of Pearl, some whole, some broken, I much wonder'd how they
could be found in a place so far distant from the Sea; I saw also scattered
every where many bits of Bitumen, which in this salt Earth and Soil is ge∣nerated
and rises upon the Water at some times of the Year, of which I
took some, and keep the Specimens by me to shew.” Moreover, I hoped to
have found something remarkable to my purpose in the Voyages of Sir <HI>George
Wheeler,</HI> where he hath describ'd <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Athens</HI> in particular, and all the
remarkable places about it, which are Places the best described of any thing
of Antiquity, and more especially in his Description of the Temple of the
Eight Winds, which is said by <HI>Vitruvius</HI> to be given to the City of <HI>Athens</HI> by
<HI>Andronicus Cyrrhastes,</HI> and is remaining intire to this Day, all except the Vane
or Weather-Cock at the top. I expected, I say, I should have met with some
very exact and curious Observations, which methinks the very design of the
place should have hinted, of the true Position of it as to those eight parts or
<HI>Plagae mundi;</HI> but I find nothing more to this purpose but that each Wind ans∣wer'd
exactly to the compass, in the mean time not telling what was the va∣riation
of that compass at that time or place; however, he doth shew that
the Position and Latitudes of places do much differ from what they had been
described to us, but then how far we may relie upon antient Observations,
will be a further doubt.</P>
<P>I should be glad that such has are better read in ancient Records would for
the future at least take notice of any Observations they meet with which may
afford some light to this Inquiry; and so for that Matter I must there leave
it; for tho' I could accumulate many Observations which do seem to make for
it, yet the uncertainty and unaccurateness of the Observations of the Anci∣ents
in this particular make me omit them.</P>
<P>And so I am reduced at last to such Observations as have been made in
latter times, and with more accurateness and diligence, and with better In∣struments,
and to what may be purposely made with Instruments a hundred
times more axact, and with designed and pertinent Observations for this ve∣ry
end; and such Observations will be principally of two kinds, First, Such
as examine and state the exact Position of the Meridian Line of places even to
a single second, or to a greater accurateness if required. And Secondly, Such as
examine and state the true Latitude for that from some few such Observati∣ons
accurately made, as they ought, more may be proved by seven Years Ob∣servations
than by seven hunder'd Years Observation of the Antients, nay tho'
they were again multiplied by seven. But of this I shall discourse in my next.</P>

<P>THis Lecture was read <HI>Feb. 9th.</HI> 1686-87, the design of which is to prove that the
diurnal Motion of the Earth must cause a recession of the Aequinoctial Parts
thereof, and an accession of the Polar, and so make it of the suppos'd prolated Figure, and
this is performed by a short and plain demonstration deduced from the Earths diurnul
Motion: A principal of Motion premised, <HI>viz.</HI> That a Body moved will persevere
to move with that velocity received in a strait Line; from hence some deductions are
made, and a short and plain demonstration that the Figure of the Terraqueous Su∣perficies
is a prolated Spheroid, and that gravity tends no where to the Center but at
the Poles and under the Aequator; and then the Author desires that Experiments
may be made for that purpose. Next follows the proposal of a way to determine by
accurate Observation, whether the Axis of the Earths Rotation changes or not.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>R. W.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>I Hoped I had by my Discourse at the last meeting evidenced the first part of
my Position which I deduced as a Corollary from the diurnal Motion of
the Earth, namely, that such a motion must cause a recession of the Sea from
the Polar parts towards the Aequinoctial, which must necessarily make the
Surface thereof of a prolated Sphaeroidical Figure. But I perceive some not∣withstanding
the Experiment, which shewed of the recess of the Water from
the Center, do yet doubt of the Consequences thence deduced with reference
to the Earth, and seem'd not to be satisfied that the two Methods which I
propounded for the examination and determination thereof were sufficient.</P>
<P>Now that I might not leave any rub behind which might be a stumbling
Block at the entrance, I have now prepared a short demonstration of the ne∣cessity
and infallible certainty thereof, as it is a deduction from an Hypothesis
which is now by most Philosophers and Astronomers granted, namely, the
diurnal Motion of the Body of the Earth upon its Axis.</P>
<P>In order to which Demonstration I must premise this principle of Motion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Body moved will presevere in that motion.</NOTE>
That <HI>every Body that hath received, or is moved with any degree of motion if it re∣ceives
no other motion from any other Body whatsoever, will constantly persevere or
continue moved with the same velocity in the streight Line of its tendency infinitely
produced.</HI> The reason of which is this, that no Reason can be assigned why its
Motion should cease where there can be no impediment. Nor is there any
reason why it should deflect to any side out of its direct way, since from the
supposition there can be no new motion added to it from any other Body.
Now this being a Principle will not admit of any other Demonstration than
that of Induction from particular Observations in Natural Motions, by which
all such Principles are made; for whosoever shall strictly and accurately ex∣amine
and analyse all local Motions, will, find hundreds of instances that af∣ter
a due analysis is made do sufficiently evidence the uniersality and cer∣tainty
of this Principle in all local Motions.</P>
<P>From which Principle it will follow, that any Body moved Circularly with
any degree of velocity (whilst some way continu'd to move about that Center)
will at the instant that containing Power is removed, proceed to move direct∣ly
forward in the straight Line of its tendency, which straight Line is a tan∣gent
to that Circle in which it aquired, or had its imprest velocity; for the
conteining Power, which by a continual atraction or otherwise towards the
Center, kept it in that Circulation, ceasing, and no other Body whatsoever
impressing any new motion upon it (as is supposed in the first Proposition) the
Body must continue to move in the streight Line of its Direction without a∣ny
Deflection, Retardation, or Acceleration.</P>
<P>From hence it will follow, that the farther it is moved in that Line, the
more and more will it recede from that Center of Motion to which it was
detained, and that for a short time with Spaces in a duplicate proportion of
the times it spendeth, or of the Spaces it passes in that tangent Line, name∣ly,
in the proportion of the smaller Secants. This, as shewn by <HI>Gelileo</HI> and
others, I pass over without farther proof.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="335"/>
From hence it will follow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 8. Fig. 1.</NOTE> that in all Circular Motions that make their
Revolutions in equal times about the same Center, but in Circles of differing
Radii, the recess in equal times will always be in the same proportion as the
Radii of those Circles, or as the Tangents or Secants of the same Angle at
the Center; this will be plain by the Scheme, where a represents the Center
of the Motion, <HI>eg, di, cl, &amp;c.</HI> Similar Arches of different Circles on the
same Center <HI>a,</HI> the Bodies placed in <HI>b, c, d, e,</HI> are put to pass their respective
Arches <HI>bn, cl, di, eg,</HI> all in the same time; now the Tangents <HI>ef, dh, ck,</HI>
bm being in the same proportion with their respective Radii, and their re∣spective
Secants, their respective receding from the Center <HI>a,</HI> will be in
proportion to their Radii.</P>
<P>Hence it follows, that the recess of the Parts of the Earth from the Axis
of the diurnal Rotation will be in the same proportion as the Sines comple∣ment
of the Latitude of those places, which recess is no where directly from
the Center of Gravity, but under the Aequinoctial it being every where per∣pendicular
to the Axis of Rotation.</P>
<P>Now the simple Gravity of the Earth as a Globous Body at rest can be no o∣ther
than to the Center of that Globe, it being consider'd only as a Globe with∣out
any Circular Motion, as I shall prove when I speak of Gravity. And this
Gravity every way equal, it will thence necessarily follow, that by the com∣position
of those two Powers acting on Bodies, there will necessarily follow
these Consequences, First, That every Meridian Line upon the Surface of
the Sea, is of an Elliptical Figure, whose shortest Diameter is in the Pole,
and whose longest is in the Plain of the Aequinoctial. Secondly, That the
Gravitation of the Earth, as moved on an Axis, is in every Latitude different,
the least under the Aequator and the greatest under the Poles.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Demonstration of the Figure of the Earth. Tab. 8. Fig. 2.</NOTE> That the Perpendiculars or Lines of Gravity or Descent do no
where, except under the Poles and Aequinoctial respect the Center of the
Earth; but other Centers in the Axis of its Rotation, let <HI>Abc,</HI> represent a
quarter of the terrestial Globe Orthographically projected upon the plain of
a Meridian, where let a, represent the Center, <HI>b,</HI> the Pole, <HI>ab,</HI> the Axis, ac,
the Aequinoctial, let <HI><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></HI> represent the Radii of certain parallels of Lati∣tude,
whose Rotation about the Axis <HI>ab,</HI> gives each of them a proportion
of velocity corresponding to their length or distance from their Axis of
Motion <HI>ab,</HI> that is in proportion to the Sine complement of the Latitude of
the place or parallel. Let <HI>c, g, b, r, n, y,</HI> represent a very thin Superficies of
the Globe of the Earth or Sea; let <HI>ac, ae, ag, ai, ab,</HI> represent the natu∣ral
Lines or Rays of Gravity tending to the Center of the Earth all of equal
length and equal power as to Gravity. The parts then in the Figure being
understood, I proceed to the Exposition of the Doctrine, let <HI>g,</HI> then repre∣sent
a Body somewhere placed upon the Superficies of the Earth; I say, this
Body will be affected or moved with a double Power: First, By a Power gra∣vitating
towards the Center <HI>a,</HI> which is the same where ever the Body be plac∣ed;
this gives it a power of descending from <HI>g,</HI> to <HI>n,</HI> in a certain space
of time. Secondly, by a levitating power in the Line <HI><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> g,</HI> whereby in the
same space of time it would ascend from the Center of its motion <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, from <HI>g,</HI>
to <HI>h.</HI> Now draw, <HI>no,</HI> parallel and equal to, <HI>gh,</HI> and draw, <HI>og,</HI> and <HI>oh.</HI> Now
because in both these Motions the acceleration is in duplicate proportion of
the times it spendeth in passing them, it follows, that the Motion composed
of both those Motions shall be made in a straight Line, namely, in the Di∣agonal
Line <HI>go,</HI> for <HI>g,</HI> being by Gravity carried ton, and by Levity, as a∣foresaid,
removed from <HI>n,</HI> to <HI>o,</HI> the place of the Body <HI>g,</HI> at the end of that
time, shall be found <HI>o.</HI> The same Demonstration will serve for <HI>c, e, i,</HI> and <HI>b,
Mutatis Mutandis;</HI> whence it follows necessarily, that the Lines of Descent of
such a Body are not to the Center of the Earth at <HI>a,</HI> but to some other
point of the Axis of Motion, as <HI>t, v, &amp;c.</HI> Secondly, The Figure of the
Water will be Oval, or truly Elliptical, as <HI>x m, o, q, r,</HI> because <HI>xy, ml, on,
qp, &amp;c.</HI> are all proportioned to their respective Radii. Thirdly, The power
of this compounded Motion will affect all Bodies in differing Latitudes with dif∣fering
Gravity, which were the proprieties to be proved.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="336"/>
From which demonstration it plainly appears, that the Consequences I
have deduc'd from the Hypothesis of the diurnal Rotation of the Earth are
necessary, and cannot, according to the Laws of Motion, be otherwise than
what I have deduc'd, not frivolous Suppositions taken up at random to solve
one Phaenomenon, but such as will give light to many other considerable ef∣fects
of Nature, as I shall demonstrate in explaining several other Phaenomena
both of the Earth and of the Heavens.</P>
<P>It further appears also, that the Experiments or <HI>Criteria</HI> I have propound∣ed,
are both pertinent and sufficient to determine and state this Enquiry
without any other, and that they are neither impossible nor very difficult to
be procur'd to be try'd with accurateness enough.</P>
<P>Now as these may easily enough be procur'd by the mediation of this Ho∣nourable
Society; so I doubt not but they may, with little more trouble, pro∣cure
such Observations and Experiments to be made as would afford great
Light towards the perfecting several other parts of useful Knowledge, some
few of which, if judiciously and pertinently contriv'd so as to be plain and
easy, would give us the determination of many old, yea, and many new The∣ories
possibly not hitherto thought of, some of which I shall hereafter have
occasion to mention. Such observations will be worthy the Care of this So∣ciety,
and will be better than accidental and casual Trials, which, tho'
surprising and pleasant, are at best but like those of the seekers of the Philo∣sophers
Stone and perpetual Motion, who generally make trials at a venture,
to see if there good Genius or Fortune will direct them to meet with what
they seek; whereas indeed all Experiments ought to be directed to some end
for the examination of some supposed Truth, and for that end to take notice
of all such Circumstances as may give any information concerning it, whether
it be for Confirmation, or Confutation of such a Doctrine, and if so, the
plainer and the more obvious the Experiments are, the better.</P>
<P>If yet there shall remain any doubt either in the deduction of this Con∣clusion,
or the sufficiency of the Experiments to determine and state the truth
thereof, I would very willingly explain any part thereof.</P>
<P>The next part of my Hypothesis is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Method of determining whether the Axis of the Earths Rotati∣on alters.</NOTE> that by many Observations I conceive
that there may be in the Rotation of the Body of the Earth, a change of the
Axis of that Rotation, by a certain slow Progressive Motion thereof, where∣by
the Poles of the said Motion appear to be in superficial parts of the Earth,
which heretofore were at some distance from the then polar Points or Parts.
I have waved all the Observations that I have hitherto met with in Histo∣ries
which might seem to favour this Hypothesis, as having found them irre∣gular
and unaccurate enough in Observations of this kind, and have put the
whole stress of its Proof, or rather Examination, upon trials to be made for
the future. But because this Motion, if any, seems to be very small and slow,
and therefore since the Age of Man, which is very short comparatively, seems
insufficient for such a purpose; I have therefore indeavour'd to carry Maho∣met
to the Mountain, since I cannot bring the Mountain to Mahomet, and
that is by contriving such ways as may perform that in a short time, which,
by the Methods of the Antients, could not be perform'd in less than some
Ages. This Contrivance consists only in the exactness of Instruments, and
the accurateness of making Observations; for if for instance we are not sure
of the truth of the Latitudes of places recorded by <HI>Ptolomy</HI> and <HI>Strabo</HI> to
a degree or two, as I can shew hundreds of places that differ more than that
from the Truth; and if by any new Method we may be able to make Ob∣servations
either of the Latitude of a Place, or of the true Meridian of
any such place to a single second Minute, than we may by such a means ar∣rive
to a certainty in a three thousand six hundred part of the time that could
be arriv'd at by such Observations as theirs are; wherein their Defects lay
whether in their Instruments, or their way of using them, or their negli∣gence
in computing, or the want of our present arithmeticial Art, and of pro∣per
and accurate Tables, or in the Doctrine and Practise of plain and Sphae∣rical
Trigonometry, I do not inquire; but certain it is, we have at present
a great advantage of them in all these particulars, but above all, most emi∣nently
by the Knowledge and Use of Optick Glasses, especially as they are
<PB N="358" REF="337"/>
applied to Mathematical Instruments, for by them only we are truly made
Gygantick, and our Eye from the little Ball of less than an Inch in Diame∣ter
is grown to be of fifty, sixty, nay a hundred Foot and more in Diame∣ter,
and may be made able to do some thousands of times more than what
our bare Eye alone without the use of such helps can perform; and there∣fore
tho' <HI>Hevelius</HI> might have some reason to be uneasy, and so to rail at me
for asserting of this Truth to the World after he had publish'd his <HI>Machina
Caelestis</HI> to shew he had made use of the best Instruments in the World for his
Observation; yet why Dr. <HI>Wallis</HI> and his Adherents, some of which have
made use of the very Contrivances which I Publish'd, should with so much
Gall write against me for it, I cannot but wonder: But I doubt not but to
prove to all the World in my own Vindication, that neither the one nor the
other had any reason but ill Will for what they did, and at the same time to
prove the truth of every particular which I have asserted in that Book to a∣ny
that will believe his own Eyes; but not to trouble you any further with
this Controversy at present, designing suddainly to publish my Answers to
them where they may be seen more at large, I shall proceed to the Methods
of making Observations both of the Meridian Line of any place, and also of
its true Latitude in respect of the Heavens to the accurateness of a single
Second.</P>
<P>And here only I have one or two Postulata to premise, which I suppose e∣very
one that hears it will readily grant; it is no more but these; First,
That it is possible, nay, practicable, to find a Point below perpendicular, to a
a Point above, tho' the distance between them be a hundred Foot, and to
be certain of the truth thereof to the exactness of a Second Minute.</P>
<P>Secondly, That the Refraction of the Air at sixty Degrees Altitude above
the Horizon does not at vary the Azymuth of a Body a single Second Minute.</P>
<P>A Third Truth I will put by way of a Postalutum, that 'tis possible, nay, easi∣ly
practicable to distinguish the parts of a far remov'd Object by the help of
Telescopes long enough, tho' they really appear to the Object Glass of that
Telescope less than that of a single Second Minute.</P>
<P>These I conceive so easy and certain, that I have put them as <HI>Postulata;</HI>
but yet If any doubt of their certainty, I do undertake to prove the Truth of
either of them both by Experiment or Demonstration, which of the two shall
be judg'd most convincing.</P>
<P>The next thing to be shewn is how to order a Telescope so that it may be
made a sight, that the true Line in which the Object appears may be certain∣ly
determin'd, and this, be the Telescope sixty or a hundred Foot or more in
length, and how to make by this, an Instrument as large as the said Tele∣scope
is a sight.</P>
<P>For the performance of these Qualifications there will be no greater difficul∣ty,
than the making a Tube for such a Telescope, or, if that be thought
too much, it may be done by two small Scaffold Poles joyned together in the
middle with convenient Lines to keep them streight, or if this be still
thought too difficult, it may be done by fitting the Object Glass in one Cell,
and the Eye Glass and Thread-sights in another, with Lines strained between
them to keep them directly parallel to each other; but the best way is by a
Telescope Tube of a due length and higness for the Object-glass made use of.</P>
<P>Supposing then a Telescope of sixty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Instruments for that purpose.</NOTE> eighty, or a hundred Foot in length
thus fitted with a Tube, to find the true Line of Direction, I fasten to the
Cell that holds the Object Glass a Needle with the point outwards against the
middle of the Glass. And the like I also fix in a small sliding Plate, that lieth
upon the Cell, that holdeth the Thread-sight together with the Eye-glass:
This Plate, by a very fine Screw, I can cause to slip out or in at pleasure, till
it be adjusted to a Line from the point of the Needle fasten'd to the Cell of
the Object-glass: To adjust this Telescope then for a sight, I direct it to some
very remote Object in the Horizon, and fix a Pin or Wire just touching the
point of the Needle at the Object-glass; then having found and remarked
some convenient Point of the Object in the Horizon, I move the Tube till the
Thread of the sight exactly lie upon it; then inverting or turning the Tube,
making the under side upermost, and the uper side undermost, the right the
<PB N="359" REF="338"/>
left and the left the rights; I cause the point of the Object-glass Needle, as also,
that of the Cell of the Threads to touch the same Points as before inversion,
then looking at the point of the Horizontal Object, I see whether the a∣fore-said
Line of it do cover the same part of the Object as it did before in∣version.
If it happen so to do, then I am certain that the Telescope is al∣ready
adjusted; but if it do not, it will be adjusted by moving the sliding
Plate with the Needle at the Eye-cell: When thus adjusted, these two
Needles points become the Indexes to my Instrument, for exactly taking the
visual Line of the Object, I observe to as great accurateness as is desired.
Having thus prepar'd the sight for my Instrument, I make choice of some
Tower of a convenient height for the resting the end of the Tube that holdeth
the Object-glass, and order it so that the Needles point may touch a fixed
point upon the same; then I make a Board below upon the Ground lying
Horizontal, whereupon the other end of the Tube may be slid Horizontal
and easily remov'd at pleasure. The Object I make choice of is the Pole∣star,
or the Star in the tail of the lesser bear. I by this means observe its
most Eastern and Western Excursion the same Night; or if it happen that one
is in the Night and the other in the Day, by means of this Telescope I can
plainly see it, tho' the Sun shine. Now the Needles point at the Object-glass
touching in both Excursions, and the Needles point at the Eye-sight
shewing the two Azymuthes of the said Excursions, wherein the Refractions
can have no effect to make the Ray bent, it will be easy enough accurately
to divide the space between the two Excursions into half, and as easy to fine
the Point below perpendicular under the Point above marked by the Needles
Point of the Object-glass, or which for this purpose will be better to find a
point above upon some building of equal height with that of the Object-glass,
by which two Points I direct my Telescope to the Horizon either North∣wards
or Southwards, and find what Object lies directly in the Meridian
Line, which I diligently note and draw the Landscape of that part of the
Horizon which appears through the Glass when so posited with the very
point of the same cover'd by the Thread-sight; which done, I continue the
said Landscape by the help of the Telescope till I bring in some remarkable
known Object, by means of which I shall be able a Year or two after to find
the same again, when the same trial is again to be repeated with the same
care. In order to determine this Question, whether the Meridian Line up∣on
the Surface of the Earth do change; by which means if it be alter'd but
a Second or two, I shall be able to distinguish it in the Horizontal Landscape.
Now tho' this Experiment upon the whole Matter may seem troublesome
and difficult to be perform'd duely as it ought, yet if we consider the Impor∣tance
thereof in this Matter, and how much can be done by the Care of one
Man in a short space, which by the Method of the Antients was to not be ex∣pected
from the performances of any one or many under the expectation of
some Ages, I conceive the Experiment may be look'd upon in the whole as
compendious, cheap and easy; there being nothing therein so difficult bus
that two Men may every day, for some days together, repeat the Observati∣ons
and Trials after the apparatus is made ready and put in order, and need
not spend above four Hours in twenty four to make them sufficiently
accurate.</P>
<P>Nor will it be very difficult in this City to find a convenient Building or
Tower for the resting the end of the Telescope of a hundred Foot long if it
be made use of; or of finding a good prospect of a far distant Meridional Ob∣ject
in the Horizon, whether towards the North or South, they being both or
either equally sufficient for this Observation: And if a fifty or sixty Foot Te∣lescope
be made use of, which will be able to perform the Observation accu∣rately
enough, with a little more Care and Circumspection, tho' with less
Labour, and Pains, and Charge, there are Houses enough to be found of suf∣ficient
height.</P>
<P>Now this Experiment I conceive sufficient to perform what is design'd, or
to be expected from it, as to this Inquiry, and all things consider'd, I con∣ceive
the best, tho' I could produce some others if there be occasion; and
further, I conceive the same to be free from all material Objections: As
<PB N="360" REF="339"/>
First; If it be Objected, that the Refraction of the Air doth make the Caere∣stial
Objects to appear out of their true places. I say, that in this Experi∣ment
it can have no effect, because the Azymuth and Circle of Position only
are sought and those the Refraction of the Air alters not; for the Star be∣ing
only to be observ'd when it it is either ascending in its most Eastern Azy∣muth,
or descending in its most▪ Western Azymuth, the effect of any would
be the same, since they are so found and observ'd at the same Altitude both
ascending and descending; and tho' the Refraction should raise them, and
the whole Circle, and the said Star to a sensible higher Position than the Truth,
yet the Points to be observ'd being both of equal Altitude, the effect will be
the same, which will no way disturb this Observation.</P>
<P>Next if it be Objected, that this Star doth alter its distance from the Pole∣star
every Year, and that will make the Excursions less in the succeeding
Year. I say, as to this Inquiry, it would have no effect, tho' it should alter
ten times more, because the middle between the Excursions in the same day,
is that which is sought in this Experiment.</P>
<P>If the parallax of the Earths Orb be Objected, which is the most material, I
Answer, That the succeeding Experiments are to be try'd again when the
Earth is in the same part of the Ecliptick, which will fully answer any Scru∣ple
thence.</P>
<P>And, upon the whole, I cannot think of any other,; but if any of this
Honourable Society can think of any Material, I would desire to be inform'd
of them, that I may think of some means of remedying them; or if they think
of any other more convenient and certain, that I may put them in practise.
Some other of my own I shall propound the next Day and leave them to the
Judgment of the Society to chuse the most fit.</P>
<P>This, I hope, may save the Labour of searching into Records of Antiqui∣ty,
of all which if I may be allow'd to judge by those I have met with, I be∣lieve
they will at best afford us but uncertain and unaccurate Observations,
and I do very much doubt whether ever there were above two thousand Years
since, any Meridian truly set to the certainty of less than one Degree; so
that tho' we had found by the great Pyramid, that there was either some con∣siderable
variety from the present Meridian, or that it were now in the very
Meridian Line, the Conclusions drawn from either of them would have been
but conjectural, since it might have been placed true, and have since varied,
as it is found, or it might have been placed wrong, and since have mov'd to
a Truth, or the contrary.</P>
<P>Whereas, since by this Experiment, we may be able to find the Meridian
true to the three thousand six hundred part of a Degree, and these Observations
may be made by one and the same Man, and with the same Instrument in the
same place, and at the same time of the Year, and of the Day; I conceive that
one Years Observation will more ascertain us in this particular, than it we
had Records of Observations made, as those I have met with 3600 Years
since, which is the Expedient I have thought of for redeeming or expanding
the power of the short Line of the Life of a Man.</P>
<P>Other Methods of determining the same Question, read<HI>Feb.</HI> 16. 168<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>In order to determine whether the Meridional Line of Places did alter, I
did in my last Discourse wave all antient Observations, as fearing there might
be wanting in them that certainty and accurateness of Observations that
might be sufficient to assure us of the Matter of Fact, and that might be
convincing as to the Reality or Nullity of such an alteration, as I suppos'd.</P>
<P>But because possibly there may be some Observations of a latter date which
have been here made within our present reach,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>1 st.</HI> By ancient Buildings.</NOTE> which are of more accu∣rateness,
I would propound it a thing not unfit to be examin'd, whether the
Position of several of the most eminent Cathedrals built by the <HI>Gothick.</HI> Arch∣itecture,
wherein great regard, if not Religion, seems to have been had of
the Position of them, according to the four quarters of the Horizon, <HI>viz.</HI>
E, W, N, and S. And to this end, because nearest this place, I could wish
<PB N="361" REF="340"/>
it were tried at <HI>Westminster Abby,</HI> which is intirely built after that Mode;
whether that be truly so plac'd that the four Ends or Fronts thereof do ex∣actly
face those Quarters, and if not, which way the variation may be, and
how much it really is at this present. The same Observation may be pro∣cur'd
to be made at several other Cathedrals, as at <HI>Salisbury, Winchester, Chi∣chester,
York,</HI> &amp;c. where there are such Buildings, which will be with no great
difficulty procur'd by the Mediation of this Society.</P>
<P>Among other places worth examining, I could wish that the great Dial∣stone
in the Privy Garden at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> were one, for that I conceive
there was very great Care and Accurateness used in the placing thereof; and
tho' this may seem, if compar'd with others of a very short continuance since
its first placing, yet it may be with probability enough suppos'd to have been
so much more accurately plac'd, that That alone may possibly make it prefer∣able
to any other whether Ancient or Modern.</P>
<P>Now because the ways publish'd for finding the true Meridian Line have
really much of difficulty in them, and require both a great Apparatus and a
considerable time to make the Observations necessary for this purpose, with∣out
which the Informations and Examinations will be very unaccurate and
scarce to be rely'd upon, therefore I have contriv'd an Instrument by which,
in a few Minutes of Time, the exact Meridian Line, at any place, may be
easily and with accurateness enough, that is, to ten Seconds, if need require;
and this free from Exceptions of Refraction, Declination, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by which the
true Position of any Building, Monument, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may be presently discover'd
and computed.</P>
<P>The first Instrument from this purpose,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>2dly.</HI> By fit instruments.</NOTE> is a Telescope of what length shall
be thought convenient to be easily used and manag'd; as suppose one of six,
twelve, or fifteen Foot, this must in the first place be fitted with Eye-sights,
plac'd upon a thin piece of Looking-glass Plate, on which must be drawn
with a very fine Diamant, such Lines and Circles as I shall direct, the Center
of all which Circles is to represent the true Polar Point in the Heavens, at the
time of the Observation of which more by and by.</P>
<P>This Sight-glass being fix'd in the Tube, the next thing to be done is to
six two pieces of Brass, or some other convenient Metal, which may have
each of them a small hole to hold a small clew of Silk fit to bear a Plumbet
or such other Instrument as I shall direct; these holes must be so place'd as
that an imaginary Line drawn over the ends of them may be exactly parallel
to the Axis of the Telescope which passeth through the Center of the Sight-glass.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Into these holes must be fitted small Silken Lines with Plumbets
hanging at them, which two Plumb-Lines will (when the Axis of the Tele∣scope
passing through the Center of the Sight-plate is directed to the Polar
Point) hang in the plain of the Meridian.</P>
<P>Fourthly, The Axis of the Telescope may be easily directed to the Polar
Point, by bringing three or more Stars of the <HI>English</HI> Rose into their proper
Circles and there fixing it.</P>
<P>Fifthly, The <HI>English</HI> Rose is a Constellation in the Heavens discoverable on∣ly
by a Telescope, consisting of six Stars in the Rose itself, and several o∣ther
in the Leaves and Branches, one of these is in the Center of the Rose,
and five in the five green Leaves of the Knob: This I have somewhere de∣scrib'd
about ten Years since, but have mislaid them at present; the way of
finding them I then shew'd to Sir <HI>Chr. Wren,</HI> and some others of this Society at
the time when my Instrument was fixed for that purpose.</P>
<P>The Instrument or Telescope being fix'd in this Position, the two Plumb∣holes
represent the true Axis of the Earth, and accordingly will serve to de∣termine
both the plain of the Meridian, and also the inclination of the Axis
to the plain of the Horizon; so that by the same Observation both the Me∣ridian
Line may be determin'd, and also the elevation of the Polar Point,
<PB N="362" REF="341"/>
which may be various ways most exactly measur'd and determin'd. Now this
is a second way of determining the true Meridian Line to what accurateness
shall be desir'd, for that the length of the Telescope is not limited, but may
be us'd of what length soever may be made, tho' it may be three hundred or
four hundred Foot, for that the Object-glass may be fix'd at the top of some
Tower or Steeple, and the Sights and Eye-glass at the Ground. But on this
I shall not at present inlarge, beeause, whenever there shall be occasion of
trial, I can easily direct the whole Apparatus.</P>
<P>As to the second Use thereof, which is for taking the Altitude of the Po∣lar
Point above the Horizon; this way is far beyond any I have met with,
and is liable to one only Objection (as I conceive) and that is the Refraction
of the Air, which elevates the same somewhat beyond its due Limits, but
then if compar'd with the best yet propos'd, I conceive it to be less subject
than any other, and to come nearer to a certainty and exactness: How∣ever
I grant it to have that Objection good against it; but if we consider
the use of this Observation as it is design'd to examine the Latitude of one
and the same place after the interval of some few Years, the Objection is
of no validity, for that the Refraction of the Air at the height proper for
<HI>London,</HI> viz. 51, 32, is hardly sensible; but then the difference between the
Refraction of the first and second Observation is yet much less discoverable,
so that for this purpose 'tis as effectual as the best.</P>
<P>But because some may yet further desire to free the Observation from Re∣fraction,
I have contriv'd another way, much less subject to it; which way
will also find the true Meridian Line to great exactness: Not to make any long
preamble to it 'tis this, Make choice of some notable fix'd Star that passeth
over or near the Zenith of the place, as here, for <HI>London</HI> the <HI>Lucida Dra∣conis,</HI>
or the last Star in the tail of the great Bear; 'tis easy, by the way I have
already publish'd in Print to find the Zenith, and the Meridian Line passing
through it.</P>
<P>Having fix'd all things requisite for this, about an Hour or two before the
Star comes to the Zenith or Meridian near it, find and observe exactly its
bearing, which may be done with a Telescope of fifty, sixty, or more Feet in
length, then by an exact Pendulum Clock number how many Seconds or half
Seconds of Time pass before it arrive at the Meridian, which note and remember,
then prepare to observe the place of the same Star after so many Minutes,
Seconds, and half Seconds have pass'd, after the Star hath pass'd the Meri∣dian,
note the Point also. There are then given three Points, which, with
the help of Calculation, the time being taken, it will give the Latitude of
the place to a great exactness; and if a Line be drawn from the most Eastern
to the most Western Observation, this will give the true E, and W, line;
and if the same be divided in half and through the same, and the Meridional
place of the said Star, a straight Line be drawn, this will give the true Me∣ridian
Line.</P>
<P>So much for the methods of observing the Latitudes and Meridian Lines
of places for the time to come.</P>
<P>But because there have been some of our later Observations of the Lati∣tudes
of some places which have been with very great Care and Accurate∣ness
made; I could likewise wish that the Latitudes of those places where they
have been so made, might be a new examin'd, to see whether any consi∣derable
difference can be found which cannot well be ascrib'd to the defect
of the preceding Observations. As the Latitude of <HI>Ʋraniburg, London, Paris,
Rome, Bolonia,</HI> &amp;c. tho' yet I fear we shall be apt to ascribe what difference
shall be found to the faileur of the preceding Observations.</P>
<P>This is all I have at present to propound concerning the external Figure
of the Water and Earth. As to the motions thereof I shall propound some
Conjectures after I have consider'd the Figure and Constitution of the next
great Fluid in compassing the Earth, which is the Air; after which I shall
propound some Conjectures at the various internal motions of those great
Fluids, which concern the Currents and Tides in the one, and the Winds in the other.</P>

<P>THis Lecture was read <HI>March</HI> the <HI>9th.</HI> 1686-87, and treats of the Figure of the
Air or Atmosphere; and first three known Properties thereof are premis'd, from
whence, and the tendency of the Lines of Gravity before proved, is demonstrated,
that the Figure of Air is more prolatedly Spheroidical than that of the Earth,
which, the Lecture being short, I forbear to Epitomise, and only observe that the Au∣thor
concludes this Lecture with naming the two great internal Motions of the Earth,
Gravitation and Magnetism; of the first he had before treated at the end of his Dis∣course
of Comets, of the later he only gives here his Hypothesis in short.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>R. W.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>I Have in my former Lectures propounded my Thoughts, and the Reasons
of them concerning the Figure of the Body of the Earth, and the ten∣dency
of the Perpendicular Lines of Gravitation; as also concerning the
probability of a variation of the Axis of Rotation in the Body of the Earth.
I have likewise shew'd the influence of those Principles upon which I ground∣ed
those Thoughts, upon the Body of the Waters incompassing this Earth∣ly
Body.</P>
<P>I come in the next place to consider the Figure of the next great fluid Bo∣dy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three known properties of the Air pre∣mised.</NOTE>
incompassing both the one and the other, and that is the Atmosphere or
Mass of Air.</P>
<P>And here for the present I shall only consider so much of the Nature and
Constitution of this Body, as seems necessary to the explication of the Fi∣gure
thereof.</P>
<P>It is now very well known, that this Body is of such a Constitution, that a
greater degree of Heat, or a lesser degree of Pressure will effect a greater de∣gree
of Expansion, that is, will cause the same parcel of Air to occupy or
fill a larger space of rome; next that the same parcel of Air, when rarify'd,
will weigh no more than when condens'd, tho' it fill a greater space, because
the real quantity of the parts that compose this Air, are still the same, tho'
there may be a greater quantity of other matter that fill the Interstitia or
Spaces between them.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That the Atmosphere is compos'd of three kinds of Substances,
one more fluid than the other, two of which, namely, the less fluid Cause
considerable effects upon the subjacent parts of themselves, and upon other
Aqueous and Terrestial Bodies by their Weight or Gravitation. These I only
name at present, designing more fully to explain them and their Causes when
I discourse of the Substance and Constitution of the Air.</P>
<P>These three things then for the present being taken as Suppositions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Atmosphere under the Ae∣quator higher.</NOTE> and
the tendency of the Lines of Gravitation, being, as I have prov'd, to differ∣ing
and various Centers, it follows that the Figure of the two lower parts
of the Air must be of a prolated Sphaeroidical Figure, and that much more
considerably differing from that of a Sphaerical Form than that of the Earth
or Water.</P>
<P>For First,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>1 st.</HI> From its swifter motion</NOTE> It is very evident, that the more gross Parts thereof are car∣ry'd
along with the subjacent Parts of the Earth, with an almost equal
swiftness; say almost, because in the wide and open Ocean there is some
kind of loss of swiftness and lagging behind, which, as I conceive, (as
<HI>Galileo</HI> and many others have done) is the Cause and Original of the East∣wardly
Winds within or near the Tropicks; from this Rotation then will fol∣low
a considerable levitation of such parts of the Air as are whirl'd round
from West to East with such a Rotation; that is, those parts which are
mov'd swiftest will have the greatest indeavour of Recess from the Axis of
Motion; and those which are mov'd slower will have a less, as I shew'd be∣fore
in my Explication of the Figure of the Water.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="343"/>
Next it is evident from the springy nature of the Air,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>2ly.</HI> From its springy Nature.</NOTE> that the less the
pressing is upon the Body thereof, the more will it expand and stretch it
self and possess a greater space. Now the quantity of Air towards the Aequi∣noctial,
having a greater Levitation upwards, or less Gravitation towards
the Earth, a greater quantity of the Air must go to make up the Cylinder
that gives an equal Pressure, and consequently the Surface or Extent of the
Air towards the Aequinoctial must upon this account be much higher than to∣wards
the Poles.</P>
<P>But in the Third place this Oval Figure of the Air must necessarily be in∣creas'd
by the differing Degrees of Heat and Cold;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>3dly.</HI> From its greater heat there.</NOTE> for that a greater De∣gree
of Heat doth expand, and of Cold doth condense the Body thereof.
Now it is evident that the Degrees of Heat near the Aequinoctial are very
great in comparison to what they are near the Poles.</P>
<P>And consequently, upon this account, also the Body of the Air towards the
Aequator, must be very high and rarify'd, and the Body of it towards the
Poles must be very low and condens'd; from which two Causes it will neces∣sarily
follow, that the Figure of the Body or Mass of Air, incompassing the
Body of the Earth and Water, must be of a prolated Sphaeroidical Figure,
much more prolated towards the Aequator than that of the Water.</P>
<P>From which Considerations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons of dif∣ferent Phaeno∣mena in differ∣ent Climates.</NOTE> I conceive, some Reasons may be drawn of
several Phaenomena taken notice of by Travellers; such as the frequency of
Foggs and Mists and various sorts of <HI>Parhelia</HI> and <HI>Paraselenae,</HI> in and near the
Polar Regions; all which argue a dense and heavy Air. And of the Hurri∣canes,
Tornadoes and the Storm call'd the <HI>Bulls Eye,</HI> which descends from a
great height with great precipitation into the lower Regions of the Air, and
of the frequent and violent Rains in the <HI>Torrid Zone;</HI> all which <HI>Phaenomena</HI>
are indications of an Atmosphere much more extended upwards, and of the
vaporous Parts carry'd to a much greater height than elsewhere.</P>
<P>From these Considerations also will follow a necessary motion or tendency
of the lower Parts of the Air near the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Circulation of the lower &amp; upper parts of the Air.</NOTE> from the Polar Parts towards
the Aequinoctial, and consequently of the higher Parts of the Air from the
Aequinoctial Parts towards the Polar, and consequently a kind of Circulation
of the Body of the Air, which I conceive to be the cause of many consider
able <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the Air, Winds and Waters, which I shall more fully ex∣plain
when I come to consider the Constitution and▪ Motion of the Body of
this great Mass, whose Figure and external Form only at the present I am
considering.</P>
<P>Nor shall I at present explain any thing farther concerning the two more
fluid Substances that help to compose or fill the space which is taken up by
the Atmosphere, because my present Subject leads me only to consider that
part of the Air which is call'd the Atmosphere, and to speak only of the Fi∣gure
thereof, of which I have no more to add at present, but shall return to
consider the Nature and Motions of each of these three great Masses, <HI>viz.</HI> the
Earth, the Water and the Air.</P>
<P>First then for the Internal motions of the Earth; there are two princi∣pally
taken notice of; the first is that of Gravitation, the second is that of Magnetism.</P>
<P>Of the first of these I have some Years since discours'd more particularly, and
therefore shall omit it at present.</P>
<P>Of the second of these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hypothesis of Magnetism.</NOTE> namely, Magnetism, I shall only propound my
Hypothesis now and explain it more particularly in my next Discourses.</P>
<P>My Hypothesis then is this, First, That all magnetical Bodies have the con∣stituent
Parts of them of equal Magnitude and equal Tone.</P>
<P>Secondly, That the Motion or Tone of one Magnetical Body is convey'd
to that of another by means of a Dense Medium.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That the motion of the Dense Medium is Circular and Vibrating.</P>
<P>From which three Suppositions all the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Magneticks will be
most evidently and clearly, even <HI>a Priori,</HI> deduc'd.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="344"/>
SInce the following Discourse treats of that surprising Experiment of the Mer∣curies
standing so much above the usual standard, and gives our Authors Ex∣plication
of that Phaenomenon, I thought fit to join it to the foregoing of the Figure
of the Atmosphere, and the rather because it also gives several very good hints of
the Nature of that fluid, as likewise concerning the Aether. This Discourse was
first read in one Thousand six hundred seventy odd to my Lord <HI>Brouncher,</HI> and with

<HEAD>Of the standing of the Mercury in the Tube to the height of 75 Inches,
read May the 28th. 1684.</HEAD>
<P>THat <HI>Theories</HI> are not altogether useless, we may perceive by the happy
invention of the ingenious <HI>Galileo,</HI> and the addition of the acute <HI>Torri∣cellius,</HI>
which two compleated the Experiment of the <HI>Aethereal Vacuum;</HI> the
further Improvement and Observation of which hath produc'd the <HI>Barometer,</HI>
now useful for predicting the variation of the Weather, and the <HI>Pneumatick</HI>
Engine much more prolifick of discoveries; the causes of most of whose
Phaenomena are sufficiently obvious, and certainly known to be the Gravi∣tation
and Spring of that part of the <HI>Atmosphere,</HI> which is call'd <HI>Air,</HI> and
agreed to by the most accurate of the Modern Philosophers. But Mr.<HI>Hu∣gens</HI>
about twenty Years since having tried Mr <HI>Boyle</HI>'s Experiment of making
Water descend in a Tube, the Orifice of which was inclosed in an exhausted
Receiver, found that if the Water were first well freed from the Air that is
usually latent in it, and then inclosed, the Water would not descend in the
Pipe, tho' the pressure of the Air were wholly taken off; this occasion'd the
trial to be made here with <HI>Quicksilver</HI> instead of Water, and by many Experi∣ments
it was at last found by Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> the Lord <HI>Broucher,</HI> and several o∣thers,
that the <HI>Quicksilver</HI> also when the Tube was very well freed from
the latent Particles of Air, would not part from the top of a Tube, tho' it
were twice as high as the usual height the <HI>Quicksilver</HI> used to stand at; and
tho' there were no more pressure upon the stagnant Vessel than was usual,
and that the bottom of the Tube were as open and free for the <HI>Mercury</HI> to
run out, as was usual for Experiments of the Mercurial Standard. This
seem'd at first to overthrow the Theory of the Gravity of the Air, and was
made use of by some <HI>Antagonists</HI> to that purpose, but with little reason; for
it was observ'd, that in the making this Experiment if a little Jog were
given to the Tube in which the <HI>Mercury</HI> thus remain'd suspended, the
<HI>Mercury</HI> would immediately leave the top and fall down in the Tube to the
usual height of about thirty Inches, and there exhibit all the same Phaeno∣mena
as the common Mercurial Standard or Torricellian Experiment had
been observ'd to do. However it could not but affect the inquisitive after the
causes of things, with a disire of satisfying themselves with some probable
Conjectures at the causes of this so strange an Effect, some supposing one
thing, some another; what my Conjectures were, and still are, I shall in
brief declare and leave them to be consider'd by such as have better Abilities,
and shall please to trouble themselves with such inquiries.</P>
<P>Since I first made the Experiment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proof of the Aether.</NOTE> I saw an absolute necessity of a pressing
Fluid very much more subtile than the Air, and yet consisting of parts of a deter∣minate
bulk, which would easily strain through and pervade the Pores of Glass,
Water and other Bodies impervious to the Air, but could be kept out by the
nearer Conjunction of some of the constiuent parts of those Bodies which consti∣tute
Pores of a much less Magnitude or Capacity, which fluid I suppos'd might
be somewhat of the Nature of the second Element of <HI>Descartes,</HI> tho' for
many Reasons drawn from Experiments, I suppos'd it to have many differing
Proprieties from those which he ascribes to his, and I saw also a necessity of
supposing a third Element consisting of a matter yet more subtile and fluid,
<PB N="366" REF="345"/>
as he supposes, and more then that, of several other fluid Matters, some
more subtile than others, each of which have their proprieties distinct, and
are the causes of this or that Phaenomenon in the World, of which there hath
as yet been no intelligible reason given of their Power and Original, as I
may hereafter shew in the Explication of some of them. And I do believe,
from that little insight I have had of the Operations of Nature, that all the
sensible part of the World is almost infinitely the least part of the Body there∣of,
and but, as it were, the <HI>Cuticula,</HI> or outward Filme of things; whereas
that which fills up and compleats the space incompass'd by that Filme consists
of a multitude of insensible Bodies, each of them as distinct in their Natures
and Operations, as Air and Quicksilver, or any other two sensible Bodies
we can name; for so many, so curious, and so minute are the insensible work∣ings
of Nature, that without supposing some such Instruments as these we
shall quickly find a <HI>non plus</HI> in the explication of any one appearance in Na∣ture.
But for the finding out the Number and Nature, of these Elements
we can proceed but by slow and single steps, and 'tis not to be expected but
from a long and close prosecution of Nature as we see that the pressure of the
Air was not detected till <HI>Galileo</HI> and <HI>Torricellius</HI> happily light upon that No∣tion,
and this second Element was not experimentally manifested till the
making of this Experiment of the <HI>Mercury</HI>'s standing much above the height
discover'd by <HI>Torricellius.</HI> The matter on which the Loadstone works will
perhaps be found another, and that which causeth Gravity a Fourth.
But this by the bye.</P>
<P>My Notion and Explication of this Phaenomenon is this, That there is an∣other
fluid Body; this Fluid is the Menstruum or Liquor into which the Air
is dissolv'd like a Tincture of Cocheneel into Water, which, as I have explain'd
in the 15th Observation Microscopical, <HI>Page</HI> 96, and 97, doth penetrate the
Pores of the Glass Water, and several other terraqueous Bodies (possibly all
such as are transparent, for that I have not a sufficient supellex as yet to de∣termine
positively; nor is it material for the Explication of this Phaeno∣menon,
as other more curious and critical Experiments shall be found out, it
will be time enough to determine it.)</P>
<P>Next that this fluid, as all other sensible fluids we meet with, hath a grea∣ter
Congruity or Incongruity to this or that Body it is contiguous to, and
therefore doth more readily join to this Homogeneous than to that Hetero∣geneous
Body, whether Solid or Fluid, and doth more easily penetrate the
small Pores of the Homogeneous, and not without some difficulty the Pores
of the Heterogeneous Bodies. And in short, that this Congruity or Incongruity
of it to other Bodies doth make it perform the same kinds of Effects with
those we find perform'd by sensible Fluids and Solids, such as I have expli∣cated
in my sixth Mycroscopical Observation.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That this Fluid doth not at all penetrate the Body of <HI>Quicksilver,</HI>
tho' <HI>Quicksilver</HI> may be penetrated by a great number of other more subtile
Fluids, such as those which cause Gravity, Magnetism, Fluidity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if at
least it shall be found necessary by future Experiments to ascribe those three
Properties to more than one fluid.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That several other Liquours whose greater Pores are penetrated
by this Fluid, may yet be sustain'd by it above the level equivalent to twenty
nine Inches of <HI>Quicksilver,</HI> so long as the Pores are not so far seperated as to
admit the parts of this Fluid between them where they are more neerly con∣tiguous,
and have some more subtile fluid Body only between them. Of this
kind Water well purged of Air may be one, as the Experiment of the not
subsiding of Water purg'd of Air doth maaifest.</P>
<P>Fifthly, That this Fluid hath a pressure every way analogous to the pressure
of the Air, and that this pressure is much greater than that of the Air.</P>
<P>Sixthly, That there is no need (for the explicating any Experiment I have
yet heard of) of supposing it to have a springy Nature like that of the Air,
since all the Phaenomena may be solved without it.</P>
<P>For the more intelligibe Explication of this Solution, I shall indeavour to
shew an Experiment very much like it, in sensible Bodies. I took then a small
Glass Cane <HI>a, b, c,</HI> open at both ends, then having procur'd a long small Glass
<PB N="367" REF="346"/>
Pipe in a Lamp almost as small as a Hair, I brake it into a great many short
ones and made of them a Stopple by binding them together Fagot-wife
with thread, and melting Wax or Cement about them, so as that none of their
Perforations were stopt, I put them into the end <HI>a, b,</HI> for a Stopple, then I
had another Cane of Glass big enough to contain the former wholly as Def.
which was fill'd with Water;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 8. Fig. 3.</NOTE> then the first Tube with the open end down∣wards
was immers'd into the said Tube Def. till the Water had fill'd the
whole, and the ends of the small Pipes <HI>iiiii,</HI> then gently raising up the Tube
<HI>a, b, c,</HI> out of the Water, I found I could raise it so high as that the Water in
the Tube <HI>a, b, c,</HI> did stand above the Surface of <HI>g, h,</HI> the Water in the Glass
Def. some Inches. Wherein 'tis observable, that tho' all the ends of the Pipes <HI>iiii</HI>
were pervious to the Air, yet by reason of a greater Congruity of the Water
to Glass than of Air, the Air was not able to force its way thorough without
the help of the Gravity of the Cylinder of Water <HI>a, g, h, b;</HI> the same Experi∣ment
I tried also with <HI>Quicksilver,</HI> by making the Stopple <HI>k,</HI> of Brass, and
instead of the small Pipes caus'd to be drill'd, thro' the same a great number of
small holes, then by the help of <HI>Aqua Fortis</HI> I caus'd all those holes to be whited
with <HI>Quicksilver</HI> then holding my Finger against those holes, and filling it with
<HI>Mercury</HI> and stopping the other end, and immerging it under other <HI>Mer∣cury</HI>
in a Dish, by degrees I rais'd the same, and found that the Air would
not force its way in at the above-said drill'd holes, till the end <HI>A, b,</HI> was
rais'd above the level of the <HI>Mercury</HI> in the Dish some Inches.</P>
<P>From both which Experiments 'twill not be difficult to understand my ex∣plication
of this Phaenomenon of the extroardinary hight of the <HI>Mercury</HI> in a
Tube, well fill'd, and perfectly cleans'd of Air: For if we suppose in the for∣mer
Experiment, that the Ambient Air doth represent the Ambient Fluid,
whose pressure we do suppose, and that the Perforations of the small Pipes
do represent the imaginary Pores of Glass, and that the Water with which
it is fill'd doth represent the <HI>Quicksilver</HI> in the new Experiment, and that we
suppose that <HI>Quicksilver</HI> hath a greater Congruity to Glass than the other,
and that consequently it keeps the other from getting a Body within the hol∣low
of rhe Tube by stopping it at its first entry, 'twill be easie to imagine
how, tho' the Glass can be supposed all over Porous, through which the Ae∣ther
can pass, the Ambient new Fluid can by its more free pressure on the
Surface of the bottom, keep the <HI>Mercury</HI> suspended forty five Inches above
the former Standard of thirty Inches.</P>
<P>Nor doth the second Experiment explicate it less naturally; for the Air
represents the Aether, or what other name soever it be call'd by: The <HI>Quick∣silver</HI>
in the one represents the <HI>Quicksilver</HI> in the other. Immerse that Dish
in a Bucket of Water, and you shall find that the top of the Tube will be
rais'd considerably higher above the Surface of the <HI>Mercury,</HI> in the Dish be∣fore
the <HI>Mercury</HI> will leave the top; Then the Water, under which the <HI>Mer∣cury</HI>
is immers'd, will represent the Air or Atmosphere, and the holes in the
Brass Stopper, the Pores of the Glass, the additional raising of the height
of the <HI>Mercury</HI> after 'tis put under Water will shew how part of the seventy
five Inches is ascribable to the pressure of the Air, and the other height will
shew how another part of it is ascribable to the pressure of the Aether. I think I
need not explain it farther, only 'tis observable, that tho' the Air finds a difficul∣ty
to make its first entry into the small holes of the Glass Pipes, or of the
Brass Stopper, yet after it hath got through, and that there is Air within
the Tube as well as without, it very readily and freely maintains its Passage,
and the same <HI>Phaenomenon</HI> also happens in the <HI>Quicksilver</HI> Experiment, for as
soon as ever the <HI>Mercury</HI> begins to seperate from the top of the Tube, and the
Aether hath a Body within the Tube, it readily falls down to the height support∣ed
by the pressure of the Air. The Reason of the two preceding Experi∣ments,
to wit, of the suspension of Water in the Tube whose end is stop∣ped
with a bundle of small Glass Pipes, as also of the suspension of the
<HI>Mercury</HI> in the Tube whose end is stopp'd with the perforated peice of Brass,
will be,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Congruity &amp; Incongruity.</NOTE> I think, sufficiently manifest to him that shall thoroughly consider
the Nature of the Congruity and Incongruity of Bodies to one another; some∣what
of my Thoughts concerning the same I have formerly deliver'd in the
<PB N="368" REF="347"/>
sixth Observation of my Micrography, which was indeed but a cursory Me∣ditation
for the solving of the Phaenomenon then mention'd; but whosoever
shall thoroughly examine the Nature and Power of it, will, I dobut not, find
it much more universal. To me indeed it seems to be not only the cause of
this extraordinary <HI>Phaenomenon,</HI> but of the Conglobation and Tenacity of most
Liquors of the Tenacity Springyness, Sonorousness, Malleability, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of all
solid and hard Bodies: But of this elsewhere when I have occasin to examine
what is the cause of Congruity itself, which I do not suppose a first Principle,
but rather of a second, third, or fourth Rank, which being more universal,
must be ascended to by degrees, after the Synthetick method. To proceed
then, I did heretofore propound in the twentieth Page of my Micrography
as a thing worthy trial to examine what Power was requisite to force a Liquor
through holes of several bigneses made in a Heterogeneous solid, and fill'd with
some Liquor Homogeneous to that solid; for were that accurately done
I judge this Experiment of the extraordinary height of the <HI>Mercury</HI> above the usual Standard would give us a demonstration of the bigness of the Pores
of Glass; for since we find that a hole of—of an Inch will make the <HI>Mer∣cury</HI>
stand suspended one Inch in height a hole of—of an Inch will make it
stand suspended two Inches; a hole of—of an Inch will make it stand three
Inches, it will follow that a hole of—of an Inch will make it stand forty
five Inches, and a hole of—of an Inch will make it stand a hundred Inches,
which minds me of several other Experiments worth trial, for determining
this controversy; such as these;</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several Expe∣riments hinted</NOTE> Whether some Glasses are not more porous than others, and conse∣quently
whether the <HI>Mercury</HI> will not stand to a much greater height in Tubes
made of Glass of a more opacous or more refracting Substance than in Tubes
of a more transparent or less refracting Substance.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE> Whether in a Tube made of Lead very intire from holes and
perfectly cleans'd of Air and rubb'd with <HI>Mercury</HI> that doth every where
stick to the same; if the said Tube be fill'd with very well cleans'd <HI>Mercury,</HI>
the <HI>Quicksilver</HI> will not stand suspended to a much greater height than it doth
in Tubes of Glass, for if Lead, Silver, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be impervious to this fluid Sub∣stance
that so freely penetrates Glass, it seems not improbable, but that the
<HI>Mercury</HI> may stand suspended to a very much greater height, and if so it will
be a certain way of finding out the force or pressure of this fluid; from the
determination of which will follow probably the reason of the Strength,
Weight, Sonorousness and Springyness of Metals. And I am the more in∣clin'd
to believe that this Experiment will succeed, because I judge that the
same fluid that conveieth height, is the cause of this Phaenomenon; and what∣soever
Body is perfectly impervious to Light, is also impervious to this fluid.
But herein I would be understood not to mean such Bodies, as by the thick∣ness
of their bulk and some degree of opacousness, do intercept the direct
passage of this fluid Matter, and so by consequence cause a kind of opacous∣ness,
as a thick Body of Red and Blew, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Glass which notwithstanding are
not perfectly opacous Bodies, because, when made very thin, they are trans∣parent
of a Red or Blew Colour: For such Bodies tho' they may intercept
the direct passage of the Light, yet may they admit the fluid freely to pass
through their winding Pores, and so may not perhaps keep the <HI>Mercury</HI> su∣spended
much higher than a Tube of Crystal-glass; whereas I am very apt
to think, that if there could be a Tube made of a Substance perfectly impe∣rvious
to this fluid Matter, the <HI>Mercury</HI> may possibly remain suspended as ma∣ny
Feet as it doth now Inches; but this trial will more fully inform. Now
that a Body may be pervious to some Liquors and yet not pervious to Light,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A way to dis∣cover the Mi∣croscopical Pores of Bo∣dies.</NOTE>
is evident by the Experiment of forcing <HI>Mercury</HI> through the Pores of Wood,
for if you take a Pipe of Beech, Elm, Oak, Firr, Ash, or the like, of four,
five, six, eight, or ten Foot long, and stopping one end thereof, you erect
it with the open upwards and fill it with <HI>Quicksilver,</HI> you shall find that the
<HI>Quicksilver</HI> will as freely and plentifully pass through the Microscopical or
Imperceptible Pores of the same, almost as it will be strain'd through the
<PB N="369" REF="348"/>
Pores of Cloath, Linnen or Leather, and will thereby so fill the Pores of the
Wood as to make it feel almost as heavy as Lead; by this way I have been a∣ble
to force <HI>Mercury</HI> into the Pores of Charcole, and divers other Vegetable
Substances, whereby the Pores of the same are made very conspncious, by
placing small peices of those Substances at the bottom of a Glass Tube of
four, six, eight, or ten Foot long, and filling the Tube with <HI>Mercury</HI> over
them, for those and most other Vegetable Substances; will, by the pressure of
such a Cylinder of <HI>Mercury,</HI> be fill'd with <HI>Quicksilver,</HI> and thereby plainly dis∣cover
the Shape and Texture of their Pores. I have not had the opportunity
to try Bones, Horns, Teeth, Hair, Quills, and the like animal Substances
this way, tho' it seems to me very probable, that their Pores may be disco∣ver'd
this way, at least by lengthing the Cylinder, and making the pressure
yet greater, or by a condensing Engine. Nay, I am inclin'd to believe, that
<HI>Mercury</HI> may be forc'd even through the Pores of Glass itself if the Cylinder
pressing be sufficiently lengthned; for by this Experiment of the suspension of
<HI>Mercury</HI> at seventy five Inches high, it seems that <HI>Mercury</HI> has a greater Con∣gruity
to Glass then the pressing Fluid or Aether hath to the same, and there∣fore
'tis not improbable but that a force as great in proportion to the bulk of
<HI>Mercury,</HI> as the force of the Aether is to the bulk of the Aether, may force
it through the Pores of Glass, that it may be subtile enough to do it, seems
probable from this, that it doth so readily penetrate the Pores of Gold, Tin,
Lead, Silver, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> those Bodies with whom it hath a perfect Congruity even
with meer apposition and contiguity; and therefore 'tis not improbable but
that a degree of force may make it penetrate the Pores of Glass, which in
probability are much greater than those of the congruous Metals, especially
since we find it can be forc'd into the Pores of Wood, Cork, Pith, Coles <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
so as to drive out the Juices contain'd in them; whereas those Juices having
a greater Congruity, do penetrate them by meer apposition. Now that this
penetrancy of <HI>Mercury</HI> into Glass is not meerly conjectural, I shall shew you
by taking notice of certain Spots or Stains which I have found in polish'd
Looking-glass-Plates after they have remain'd a long while foil'd, and then
being unfoil'd, for I have very plainly seen with a Microscope that there hath
been in the place, where spots appear, an infinite number of exceeding minute
Parts of <HI>Mercury</HI> which seem to be gotten into the very Pores of Glass, and
can by no kind of rubbing be fetcht out without wearing away so much of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he very Substance of the Glass itself: What therefore is thus done acciden∣tally
by duration, might in probability be much better done by pressure, if
we were able to make it considerable enough, as by letting down Glass in
<HI>Mercury</HI> to a very great depth under Water, where that can be done; or to
a considerable depth under the pressure of <HI>Mercury.</HI> It may possibly be Ob∣jected,
that if <HI>Mercury</HI> hath a greater Congruity to Glass than this suppos'd
Fluid, why doth not the <HI>Mercury</HI> without much force penetrate the Pores of
Glass at first, and so running through it, make it appear opacous. To which
I Answer, That tho' I suppose <HI>Mercury</HI> to have a greater Congruity to Glass
than this Subtile Fluid, yet that it hath not a perfect Congruity, but rather
an Incongruity in respect of other Fluids that are more Congruous, as Air.
Nor hath that a perfect Congruity, but rather an Incongruity in respect of
Water; for there may be infinite degrees of Congruity, as Water salt hath
more Congruity to Glass than Water fresh, Waters than Vinous Spirits, Vi∣nous
Spirits more than Oils, Oils more than Airs and Fumes, and they more
than <HI>Mercury,</HI> and <HI>Mercury</HI> than this fluid Aether, or what other Name so∣ever
we call it by; and in every one of these degrees of Congruity or In∣congruity
there may be a multitude of other Subdivisions; as for instance, un∣der
the first Head there may be a very great variety; I know some, acid Li∣quours
that will of themselves, without any force, penetrate the Pores of Glass
so as to dissolve it into a Powder, whereas others will not at all penetrate
or dissolve it by any means I have yet found: But this part of Congruity and
Incongruity by which solid Bodies become dissoluble by Fluids, and where∣by
Fluids readily penetrate each other, and unite with one part of a Fluid,
and separate or precipitate another, belonging to another Subject, I shall pre∣termit
<PB N="370" REF="349"/>
at present, and only take notice of some things that may be perti∣nent
to the Inquiry under Consideration; and those may be these;</P>
<P>First, That there is no difficulty at all in admitting, that within the same
Liquor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Variety afflu∣ids in the same Liquor.</NOTE> which to the sight appears uniform, there may be a greater variety of
Fluids of differing penetrancy, for we find in <HI>Aqua Regis</HI> for instance, that
there are the <HI>Sal Armoniack</HI> parts that help to penetrate Gold; the <HI>Nitrous</HI>
that penetrate Silver, Copper, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the <HI>Flegme</HI> that will penetrate neither:
There have been few Experiments made of the penetrating of one Fluid by
an other, beside that I formerly shew'd of Water and Oil of <HI>Vitriol,</HI> 'tis a
copious Head, and contains much of information; Copper and Tin melted
are an example of it. From which Observation we may without difficulty
suppose the Air (as it is commonly taken) to be a Body consisting of a great
variety of Fluids, of which this Aether we supppse may be one; and possibly
the principal which takes up the greatest space, and whose Effects are the
suspension of <HI>Mercury</HI> above the height suspended by the pressure of the Air and
the like; tho' yet I suppose it not the subtilest, there being many Experiments
that do seem to require a much more subtile and penetrant Fluid, of which
more elsewhere. The Elastical Part of the Air that causes the Phaenomena
of Springing a Second, the Steams of Bodies a Third, the Nitrous part a
Fourth, each of which have several degrees of penetrancy, and may possibly
be several distinct Fluids, tho' when blended altogether they make that com∣pound
Body, which we call the Element of Air. Now as the Air consists of
a variety of Fluids, so 'tis not unlikely but that each of these may differ in
their proportionate quantity, and in their respective Gravity; so that if we
should take the whole bulk of the Air or Atmosphere we might possibly find
it made up of divers Fluids,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Fig. 4.</NOTE> as of the Fluids <HI>A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H,</HI> &amp;c.
and each of these of differing proprieties, both as to penetrations, Quantities
and Gravity, Congruity, and the like; and that That part of it which is next
the Earth might be a compound of the Fluids <HI>A, B, C, D,</HI> and <HI>G, H,</HI> exten∣ding
to a certain number of Yards above the level of the Sea, the next part
of the Atmosphere immediately above it may consist of <HI>B, C, D, E,</HI> and <HI>G, H,</HI>
and have nothing of <HI>A</HI> or <HI>F.</HI> The third Region may consist of <HI>C, D, E, F,
G, H,</HI> and have nothing of <HI>A,</HI> or <HI>B:</HI> And this seems probable, Frst, because
we find that there are several distinct Surfaces of the Air, upon which the
several Regions of the Clouds seem to swim like Froth upon the Surface
of Water; for 'tis obvious to any that shall observe it, to see the under Surface
of the Clouds smooth and level, and the upper in confus'd heaps, and fur∣ther,
that all the under Surfaces of Clouds appearing at the same time lye as
near as one can judge by the Eye in the very same Level. Next that the make
of the Clouds in a higher Region are quite differing. Thirdly, that the
parts of the Air in several heights from the Earth, have differing proprie∣ties,
as it hath been found in very deep Wells, that the lower twenty Fa∣thoms
were all possess'd by a Damp, or an Air in which no Fire would burn,
or Animal live. We are inform'd also, that the Air at the top of some ex∣ceeding
high Mountains is of such a Nature as will not serve for Respiration.
Possibly the presence of <HI>A,</HI> in the lowest, may be the cause of the first Ef∣fects
and the want of <HI>B,</HI> at the tops of Mountains may be there the cause of
those other Effects.</P>

IN the following Lectures the Reader will find a Confirmation of the foregoing
Treatise of Earthquakes and their several Effects or Consequences, as likewise of
the Corrollaries raised from them, and tho' they are not all here Printed in the or∣der

to joyn those Tracts together that related to the same Subject than interpose others
of far different Matters. In these our Author endeavours to confirm his former
Hypothesis by Histories; and in the first place by two very remarkable ones, the first
that related by <HI>Plato</HI> in his <HI>Timaeus,</HI> the other that of the Circumnavigation of <HI>Hanno</HI>

<DIV2>
<P>I Have indeavour'd to discover and prove the true Figure of this Body of
the Earth upon which we Inhabit, and likewise to give some Conjectures
concerning the <HI>Form</HI> and <HI>Shape</HI> of the <HI>Superficial</HI> Parts thereof. This I have
done in order to comply as near as I could with a Natural Method of Natu∣ral
History: This great Body being the Mother of all Terrestial Productions,
which make up the greatest part of <HI>Natural History;</HI> and the Foundation, as
it were, upon which, not only all that History, but all the other Parts and
Superstructures almost do rest; for from the Productions of this we take our
Principles, we raise our Axioms and Maxims, we form our Similitudes, we
make our Observations, Experiments and Trials, and by Analogy from Com∣parison
and Similitude we deduce our Conclusions. I thought it therefore
not improper, since Natural History will carry us into forein Parts of the
World, very far remov'd from this our Country or the Earth, to be first of
all a little acquainted, at least, with what we have at home, that thereby we
may the better be able to observe and judge of what those far remote Parts
may present us with, whether they be like our own or not, in what they agree,
and in what they differ, that these we know at home may be the Standards
and Touch-stones of all the rest we meet withal Abroad.</P>
<P>In prosecution of this Method,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Figure of the Earth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> I began first to shew what seem'd to me to
be the most likely Figure of the whole Body, which I shew'd for several Rea∣sons
seem'd to be of a prolated Sphaeroidical Figure, not of a perfectly Glo∣bular,
as most Authors suppose and affirm, much less of an Oblong Oval, as
the ingenious Author of the sacred Theory of the Earth, and some others,
have indeavour'd to make probable.</P>
<P>From this I deduc'd the prolated Sphaeroidical Figure of the Waters also,
and more eminently of the Air or Atmosphere, and from that deduc'd these
Conclusions, That the Lines of Gravitation or Perpendicularity did not tend
to one single point, as all hitherto have asserted, but to infinite points in the
middle parts of the Axis.</P>
<P>And that a Degree, or a 360th part of the <HI>Aequinoctial</HI> did not agree
exactly with any one Degree in a <HI>Meridian,</HI> and thence that the Magnitudes
of the respective Parallels were not to be estimated as if the Body were truly
Globular.</P>
<P>From this I deduc'd a necessity of a differing Gravitation of the same Bo∣dy
in differing parts of the Earth, and thence a necessity of a differing length
of Pendulums to measure by their Vibrations the same quantity of time, by
which the universal Standard of Measure, by some suppos'd from the length of a
Pendulum, became questionable and dubious.</P>
<P>I have likewise shewn what Observations of Celestial Bodies were likely to
be assistant to the perfecting and confirming of these Matters, at least of
discovering the Truth whether really so or not.</P>
<P>I have also inquir'd concerning the fixedness and instability of the Terrestial
Axis, and shewn some Arguments to induce us to believe that it may have
and suffer a mutation, and not be always fixt in the same parts of the Earth,
and by what methods that may be ascertain'd in a short time with more exactness
<PB N="372" REF="351"/>
than many Ages of Observations made with less accurateness would have
done.</P>
<P>And from thence I have deduc'd what would be some of the necessary
Consequences of such a mutation; such as the differing Latitude of places in
differing Ages. The differing Azymuth of Places as to one anothers Position;
the differing Altitudes of Places with respect to the Superficies of the Sea, as
the Emerging of some places from below that Surface and the sinking un∣der,
and the being overwhelm'd by that Surface in others, and consequently
of changing the Nature, Soil, Climate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the superficial Parts of the
Surface; to which, as I conceiv'd, some alterations might be ascribed.</P>
<P>But Lastly, I shew'd that the ruggedness and inequalities of Hills and Dales,
Mountains and Lakes, and also the alterations of these superficial Parts of the
Earth, as to the seeming Irregularities thereof at present, seem'd to me to be
most probably ascribable to another Cause, which was Earthquakes and
Subterraneous Eruptions of Fire. That there had been many such altera∣tions
I indeavour'd to prove from the almost universal Disposition of those
curious Medals of former Ages now found in the petrify'd Monuments of
the parts of several both Terrestial and Aquatick Animals and Vegetables,
but especially by those Productions of the watery Element found in places
now far remov'd from the Sea, and far above its Level; of which I have
produc'd several Instances, some of which, and those very considerable, were
procur'd by the inqnisitiveness of a Person here present.</P>
<P>I have made some Excursions out of this Method; as First, in order to
answer the Doubts and Scruples of some, and the Obloquies of some other
Persons, who, I hope, are now, or will be somewhat better satisfy'd, which
I wish all might be, for I have no desire to impose Conjectures and Inquiries
as Demonstrations, but only to shew what Arguments have inclin'd me to be
of these Opinions, which, whether sufficient, I must leave to their better
Judgments and Examinations, hoping at least that no preposession will hinder
them from examining them with Candor and Indifference, as I indeavour to
do in all my Inquiries. Next by some Experiments made for the clearing some
accidental Discourses at the meeting, as those about the best ways of com∣municating
force at a distance, and of making a Pendulum to observe by
Trials the Velocities of the parts of Pendulous Vibration, and to make a
Pendulum that shall, without Clock-work, continue moving twelve Hours or
longer. And Thirdly, By accidental Observations made of the growth of
Trees and some others; nor will it, I hope, be taken amiss that I indeavour
to produce such Arguments as occur to me, that seem to favour these Con∣jectures,
tho' possibly much better may be shewn by others eithers for or a∣gainst
them; however give me leave to alledge what I can to answer such as
I conceive are not sufficiently cogent Arguments against what I have supposed.</P>
<P>One of the most considerable Objections I have yet heard, is, that Histo∣ry
has not furnish'd us with Relations of any such considerable changes as I
suppos'd to have happen'd in former Ages of the World; I do confess our
Natural History as to these and many other matters of the first Ages is very
thin and barren, but yet I conceive not wholly devoyd of Instances, nay,
possibly if they be look'd into with a little more attention than hitherto has
been used, they may be found to contain many more than has of late Ages
been imagin'd. Some things of this kind, I fancy I have detected, of which
I shall produce some, together with some Remarks upon them, which I have
added, they are, I conceive, related as true Histories; but whether so or not
I must leave others to judge who are better Antiquaries and Criticks.</P>
<P>What Learning and Accounts of Ancient Times the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> might have
in their Histories,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Account of the Atlantis out of <HI>Plato</HI>'s Timaeus.</NOTE> who are said by <HI>Plato</HI> in his <HI>Timaeus,</HI> to have had accounts
of great alterations in the World for nine thousand Years before <HI>Salon,</HI> which
is now above two thousand Years since, it is very hard to guess from that short
account that is there given of it; yet since of all the Records that are to be
met within the Ancient Historians to this purpose, this is the most consider∣able,
I thought it would not be improper to relate it on this occasion, by
reason that tho' it should be accounted <HI>fabulous,</HI> as some have thought, and
<PB N="373" REF="352"/>
to be only a Fiction in <HI>Plato</HI> in order to lay a Scene for his Republick; yet
there is so much of Probability in it (bating only his number of Years) and
so much of Reason and Agreement with the State of things, that if it be
not a true History, it will at least shew that <HI>Plato</HI> himself had, at that time,
some such Notion or Imagination of the <HI>Preceding State of the Earth,</HI> and that
he saw, or found at least, some very good Arguments for his being so; <HI>Plato</HI>
then in his Dialogue maketh <HI>Critias</HI> thus speak, “Hear, O <HI>Socrates,</HI> a won∣derful
indeed, but yet a true History, which <HI>Solon,</HI> the wisest of the seven
Wise Men, related to my Grandfather <HI>Critias,</HI> as the old Man hath since
told me; among other things he told me of the memorable Actions of this
City (<HI>Athens</HI>) by length of Time, and Death of many, quite obliterated.
But among the rest he related one remarkable Passage, which I think now
proper to acquaint you with, and it was an old History, which he being
then about ninty Years old, told to me when I was about Ten, upon a solemn
Day, when I, with divers other Boys, as the Custom was, were wont to re∣cite
divers Verses by Heart to see which could excel, among which were
divers Verses of <HI>Solon:</HI> And I remember I heard my Grandfather then say,
that if <HI>Solon</HI> had but committed to Verse, not what he did for refreshing
of his Mind, but seriously, and like other Poets, the History, which he,
returning out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> resolv'd to have written (from which, by disturbances
which he met with at home, he was interrupted in perfecting) neither <HI>Ho∣mer,
Hesiod,</HI> nor any other Poet, would have been comparable to him. This
was of the greatest Affair that had been transacted by this City, of which
we have no remains at present, by reason of the length and injury of Time.
The summ of what I remember was, That <HI>Solon</HI> going into <HI>Egypt</HI> to <HI>Saim,</HI> at the
Mouth of the <HI>Nile,</HI> when <HI>Amasis</HI> was King, was there receiv'd honourably.
There he inquiring of those Priests which were most skilful in those Matters
concerning the Memorials of great Antiquity, found, as he related, that
neither himself nor any other Greek knew any thing of Antiquity; and
when he to provoke the Priests to tell him some of their Knowledge, had, in
there presence, spoken concerning the most antient Actions of the <HI>Athenians</HI>
of <HI>Phoroneus</HI> and <HI>Niobe,</HI> and of <HI>Pyrrha</HI> and <HI>Deucalion,</HI> after the inundation of
the World, and of the times when those had happen'd; one of the Seniors
of the Priests cried, O <HI>Solon, Solon,</HI> you Greeks are all Boys, not one Old
Man among you. <HI>Solon</HI> asking him why so? The Priest answer'd, beeause
you have young Heads always that contain nothing of ancient History,
of ancient Opinion, or of Old Mens Science, which has happen'd to you by
reason that there have been already, and shall be many and various De∣structions
of Men: But the greatest of all will be caus'd necessarily, either
by a Conflagation of Fire, or an Inundation of Water; but the lesser by
innumerable other Calamities: For what you tell of <HI>Phaeton,</HI> the Son of the
Sun to have got into his Father's Chariot, and not knowing how to Drive
like his Father, had fired the Earth, and with that Flame had almost set
Fire to the Heavens, tho' it may seem fabulous, yet 'tis not without its
truth in some sense. For in long process of time there is a certain <HI>permuta∣tion
of the Caelestial Motions which a vast Inflammation must necessarily follow.</HI>
Whence such as inhabit high and dry Places will suffer more than such as are
nearer the Sea and Rivers. Now our <HI>Nil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> as it is in most other things ve∣ry
wholesome for us, so will it preserve us from such a Destruction. But
when the Gods of the Waters shall wash away the Filth of the Earth by a
Flood, those which feed Sheep and other Cattle at the tops of the Moun∣tains
will scape the danger; but your Cities that are situated in the Plains,
by the impetuosity of such Floods will be swept into the Sea. But in our
Region we have no Water descends from above, but all ours springs out of
the very Bowels of the Earth; which is the reason that with us the Re∣cords
and Monuments of the most antient things are safely preserved.
Whence it comes to pass, that where neither too great a Storm of Rain
nor any extraordinary Fire happens, tho' sometimes more, sometimes fewer,
yet still some Men always escape. Now whatever we hear that is worthy
notice, either acted by our selves, you, or any other Nation we keep describ∣ed,
in our Temples: With you indeed, and other Nations things lately
<PB N="374" REF="353"/>
done have been committed to Writing, and preserved by other Monu∣ments.
But in certain periods of Time there come from the Heavens cer∣tain
Destructions which depopulate all; whence the following Generations are
depriv'd both of Letters and Learning. Whence you are all again made
Boys, rude, and altogether ignorant of preceding Matters. Hence 'tis that
what but now you speak of, O <HI>Solon,</HI> differs very little from Childish Fa∣bles.
First, In that you make mention but of one Inundation, whereas
many have preceeded. Next, That the stock of your Ancestors which was
most Eminent, and of the best, you know nothing of; whence both thy self
and the other <HI>Atheneans</HI> had your Birth, which was a small Remnant that
scaped the publick Destruction: Which becomes unknown to you; for that
this Remnant and their Posterity for many Years wanted the use of Let∣ters;
whereas your City before that had excelled both in the Arts of War
and Peace, of which we had a full account.” [So he proceeds to tell how
they had Records of their own City for nine Thousand Years, and of the
Laws, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as also, of long times for <HI>Athens,</HI> which I pass over, and only
mention what seems to relate to Natural History.] He proceeds then,
“Many wonderful Actions of your City are preserved in our Monuments;
but one above the rest for Greatness and Virtue exceeds; for 'tis said, that
your City resisted a numberless company of Enemies, which coming out of
the Country where the <HI>Atlantick-Sea</HI> now is, had conquer'd almost all <HI>Eu∣rope</HI>
and <HI>Asia;</HI> for at that time was that navigable Streight which is call'd
that of <HI>Hercules Pillers</HI> which had near the Mouth, and as it were in the
very entrance of it, an Island then said to be bigger than <HI>Lybia</HI> and <HI>Asia,</HI>
through which was a Passage to other Neighbouring Islands, and from the
Islands was a prospect to the main Lands lying near the Shoar, but the
Mouth of the Streights was very narrow. This Sea was truly the Ocean,
and the Land was truly a Continent. In this <HI>Atlantick Island</HI> was a most
great and wonderful Power of Kings, who Rul'd over, not only that whole
Isle and many others, but over the greatest part of the Continent, and e∣ven
over those which were near us, for they Reigned over a third part of the
World, which is call'd <HI>Lybia</HI> even unto <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and over <HI>Europe</HI> even to the
<HI>Tyrrhene</HI> Sea; the whole power of these collected together, invaded both
ours, and your Country, and even all the Lands within the <HI>Hercule<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>
Streights, but both your and our Country repell'd them; the manner I o∣mit.
Afterwards by a prodigious Earthquake and Inundation which hap∣pened
in a Day and a Night, the Earth cleaving swallow'd up all those War∣like
Men, and this Island of <HI>Atlantis</HI> was drown'd by a vast Inundation of
the Sea, by which means that Sea became unnavigable, by reason of the Mud
of that sunken Island which was left▪ the rest I omit.” Now,</P>
<P>Whether this Relation be a Fiction or Romance invented by <HI>Plato,</HI> or a
true History, I shall not now dispute, only by all the Circumstances of <HI>Plato</HI>'s
relating of it, I conceive he design'd to have it to be reputed a true History
and not a Romance, for that his design for laying a Scheme for his imaginary
Government, needed no such Fiction, and accordingly he made very little, if
any, use of the Circumstances of it that relate to Natural History. How∣ever,
be it what it will, it evidently shews that <HI>Plato</HI> did suppose and believe
that there had been in many preceding Ages of the World, very great changes
of the superficial Parts of the Earth by Floods, Deluges, Earthquakes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
for as much as he could suppose a Continent or Island as big as the third part
of the known Earth, to be by one Earthquake sunk into the Sea and over∣whelmed
by it.</P>
<P>I think therefore I may at least conclude, that divers of the Antients, and
particularly <HI>Plato,</HI> had some knowledge of past Catastrophys of some parts of
the World. And those to have been caus'd by Earthquakes and fiery Erupti∣ons,
such as had sunk some places into the Sea and rais'd other places out of
it, of great Floods also and Inundations by Rains and Eruptions of the Sea:
And that some of those had happened in <HI>Greece,</HI> others without the Streights
Mouth, and others elsewhere, and at another opportunity I shall produce a
Cloud of Witnesses to this effect, which, I conceive, will put it past dispute▪
but because this Relation has been possibly too long, I shall only add one Re∣lation
<PB N="375" REF="354"/>
more, because it seems to relate to the remainders of the Island of <HI>At∣lantis,</HI>
and it seems to be of a later date much than the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Stories.</P>
<P>That which I mean is the History of the <HI>Periplus</HI> of <HI>Hanno</HI> the <HI>Carthaginian.</HI>
When it was writ I know not, but sure it was very ancient, 'tis lately in the
Year 1674, Publish'd by <HI>Abrahamus Berkelius,</HI> with some fragments of <HI>Stepha∣nus
Byzantinus,</HI> with the Commentaries of <HI>Gesnerus</HI> and <HI>Bochart,</HI> being but
short I have put it into English.</P>
<P>It pleas'd the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> that <HI>Hanno</HI> should sail beyond the Columns of <HI>Her∣cules</HI>
and build <HI>Lybyphenician</HI> Cities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The History of <HI>Hanno</HI>'s Cir∣cumnavigation.</NOTE> he went then with sixty sail of Ships each
rowed with fifty Oars, in these were transported to the number of 30 Thous∣and
Men and Women with necessary Provision and Stores. After we had
sailed two Days without the Columns; the first City we built we call'd <HI>Thy∣miaterium;</HI>
under this lay a large Plain, thence carried Westward we made
<HI>Solunte</HI> a Cape of <HI>Lybia</HI> cover'd with Wood, where having built a Fane to <HI>Nep∣tune,</HI>
we tacked about and sailed <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> towards the South, half a
Days sail into a Lake not far from the Sea, filled with many and large Canes,
where were fed Elephants and various other wild Beasts; having passed this
Lake in one Days sail, we built those Maritime Cities, <HI>viz. Caricus, Gytte,
Acra, Melissa</HI> and <HI>Aranibys;</HI> sailing thence we arriv'd at the great River <HI>Lix∣us</HI>
which falls out of <HI>Libya.</HI> Near this the <HI>Nomades</HI> (a sort of Grasiers or
Cattle-herds) and <HI>Lixitae</HI> feed their Cattle, with these having made Friend∣ship
we stay'd sometime. Beyond this the savage <HI>Aethiopians</HI> live, whose
Country is full of wild Beasts, and intercepted with great Mountains from
which the <HI>Lixus</HI> flows. Those Mountains the <HI>Trogloditae</HI> inhabit a strong
sort of People swifter in Running than Horses, as the <HI>Lixitae</HI> told us. From
hence we coasted two Days Southwards, and then one Day more <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
and in a Bay found a small Island five Stadia in Compass, where we left some
Planters and called it <HI>Cerne;</HI> this, by the Journal of our Voyage, we judged
to be in the same parallel with <HI>Carthage,</HI> and as far without the Columns as
<HI>Carthage</HI> was within. Hence we enter'd a great Lake, through which past
a great River, which we called <HI>Chreses.</HI> There we found three Islands bigger
than <HI>Cerne.</HI> From these in a Days Voyage we reach'd the inermost parts of
the Lake: It was incompassed with vast Mountains, inhabited by Savages,
who threw Stones at us. Thence sailing we past a large River full of Cro∣codiles
and Hippopotams, and return'd to <HI>Cerne.</HI> From hence we past twelve
Days by the Coast towards the South, all inhabited by <HI>Aethiopians,</HI> much a∣fraid
of us, and not understood by our Interpreters; the last day we disco∣ver'd
great Mountains covered with Woods, which were of various Kinds
and Odoriferous. Coasting round these Mountains we found an immense
opening of the Sea, that side which was next the Continent was a plain Coun∣try,
from whence by Night we perceived Fires from all places, some greater
some lesser Watering here we Coasted along for five Days till we came to
a great Bay, which they called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Here we found Lakes and Islands,
where landing we found nothing by Day but Woods, but in the Night we
saw many Fires, and heard an innumerable noise of Drums, Trumpets,
Cymbals, and the like; wherefore being afrighted, and our South-sayers
commanding us also to leave it, we Coasted <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
the burning Coast of stinking Vulcano's, from whence there run out into the
Sea Rivers of Fire, and the Earth was so burning hot that our Feet could
not indure it. Hence therefore we hasted and for a Days sail we saw all the
Land full of Fires in the Night; but in the middle of these was one vastly
bigger than the rest, so that it seem'd to touch the Stars; this, in the Day-time,
we found to be a prodigious high Mountain call'd <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
or the Chariot of the Gods, in three Days sail more we past all the fiery Ri∣vers,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The reason why I have been so particular in translating the whole Story, is
because I conceive it is an instance in History so considerable, especially as to
the preceding Relation of <HI>Plato,</HI> that I can hardly believe there is a better
Instance to be found. <HI>Plato</HI> tells us of the Island of the <HI>Atlantis</HI> that it
was by an Earthquake some Thousands of Years before him sunk into the Sea,
but yet so that it left many Lakes and unnavigable Places. This gives us a
<PB N="376" REF="355"/>
Relation of a Navigation (over the very place where the <HI>Atlantis</HI> was placed
and sunk by the former Relation) in the times of <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Macedon,</HI> or soon∣er,
as some suppose; these Navigators find the Coast of <HI>Africa</HI> without the
Mouth of the Streights to trend Westward almost <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>ad Occas∣um.
Gesner,</HI> in his Notes upon this place, seems a little startled, and says, <HI>At∣qui
mihi videtur ambientibus Africam omnis past columnas Navigatio converti vel
ad Meridiem vel ad Orientem &amp; postremo ad aquilonem;</HI> not thinking, I suppose,
of this Supposition. He seems also to be as much to seek about the situation
of <HI>Cerne,</HI> but at last he thinks it may be the <HI>Maderas</HI> (p. 85.) which I conceive
to have lain North-westward from it, but with divers Gulphs and Bays in which
were divers great Lakes and Islands, divers Mountains likewise and some
Rivers. But which is most considerable, a great part of this Island to the
South was then all on Fire. Now comparing this Relation to the present
State of those parts, we find all that Continent which they passed by between
the Columns and <HI>Cerne,</HI> to be wanting, for 'twill be hard to reconcile the Re∣lation
with the present State of that Country, so in probability sunk and co∣ver'd
with the Sea; for <HI>Cerne</HI> by this Description, lying in the same Lati∣tude
with <HI>Carthage,</HI> and as far from the Pillars without as <HI>Carthage</HI> was within,
it must have lain to the North or North-west of the <HI>Maderas,</HI> from which
place the Coast of the main Land seemed then to trend South for twelve Days
Voyage as far as the <HI>Canary Islands</HI> are now found, or somewhat farther,
from whence it turned away to the Eastward. About these Islands, I con∣ceive,
was the Land that was all on Fire, multitudes of which they saw in
the Night, and heard the noise of the Vulcanes, and Rivers of Fire running
into the Sea, and in some places found the Earth so hot as to burn their Feet.
That which directs me the better in this Conjecture, is the prodigious <HI>Vulca∣no</HI>
mention'd, called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the Chariot of the Gods, by reason of its
prodigious height, seeming to touch the Stars. This, in all probability,
seems to have been the same with the present <HI>Pike</HI> of <HI>Tenarif,</HI> which tho' it
burns not now, yet, yet there are present Evidences enough, as I have been
told by those who have been at the top of it, to prove it to have formerly
been a <HI>Vulcano.</HI> And if they had now been wanting, yet no longer since
than <HI>Sebastian Munster</HI>'s time it was known to be so, and in his Geography he
has so described it. Besides, this by late Example, as in 1639, and by a
latter in <HI>Ferro,</HI> which I have Printed, it appears, that those Vulcanoes are
not Strangers to those Parts even in this Age: But I have detained you too
long with those Conjectures, yet if all Circustances be examined in the Re∣lation
of <HI>Plato</HI>'s, <HI>Atlantis,</HI> and in that of <HI>Hanno's Periplus</HI> and compar'd with
the present Condition of those Parts, I conceive there will appear many Rea∣sons
to make us conclude that there have been in those parts prodigious alte∣rations
somewhat like those I have supposed in my Hypothesis, which may
serve as an instance of History for such Mutations. The next opportunity
I shall produce many other, which, I conceive, will as plainly speak the same
thing, according to the Mind and Intention of most of the Ancients, and
this is to take off the odium of Novelty.</P>
<P>After the foregoing Passages quoted out of <HI>Plato</HI>'s <HI>Timaeus</HI> and the <HI>Periplus</HI>
of <HI>Hanno,</HI> I shall adventure to present this illustrious Assembly with some of
my Conjectures at the meaning of the Fables of the Poets, but first to say some∣thing
as to that of <HI>Plato</HI> and of the <HI>Periplus,</HI> which last is suppos'd by several
Authors to be very Ancient. From both those Relations compar'd together,
there seems at least to result a probability, that there has been some great
changes of the superficial Parts of the Earth, where <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he now <HI>Atlantick</HI> O∣cean
without the Streights of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> as they are now call'd, is; and then
we have certain Histories now to prove that the main of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> hath
extended Westward beyond the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and Southward as far as somewhat
farther than the <HI>Canaries.</HI> I have given the Reasons why I entertain'd those
Conjectures, which I submit to the Judgment of such as are more knowing
and better read in Historical Matters.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="356"/>
<HI>Varro</HI> has distributed the Ages of the World into three, <HI>viz.</HI> the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> we know nothing from Heathen Writers;
of the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> we must look for an account from the Fables of the Poets,
<HI>Homer, Hesiod, Ovid,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Ovid,</HI> to pass by <HI>Hesiod</HI> and <HI>Homer,</HI> is said to have
imitated the Greek Poet <HI>Parthenius,</HI> and has left us a very large History of
the changes that had anciently happened in the World, his whole Metamor∣phosis,
being, as I take it, written for that purpose: We are extreamly obliged
to <HI>Pliny</HI> and some few others, as all well know, for what they had collected out
of others, or wrote from their own Observation and Knowledge.</P>
<P>Now, that <HI>Ovid</HI>'s Metamorphosis was penned for this end we may find by
the 4 first Verses.</P>
<Q><LG>

</LG></Q>
<P>That is the time of <HI>Augustus Caesar</HI> in which he Lived.</P>
<P>The Hypothesis in <HI>Ovid</HI> (for I conceive it only an Hypothesis in him) is
this, that the prae-existent Matter of the World was first, a quantity of Mat∣ter
without any particular form, <HI>Rudis indigesta{que} moles,</HI> a rude disorder'd Mass,
and yet it had the property in it which (when directed afterwards to some
Center) was weight, which as yet he calls <HI>Pondus iners</HI> unactive weight.
Secondly, It had in it the seminal Principles, which were afterwards
to effect the Productions, these he calls <HI>discordia semina rerum,</HI> the jarring
Seeds of things, as being then <HI>non bene junctarum,</HI> not well conjoined, no
not to form the Sun, Moon, or the Earth, the primary or secundary Pla∣nets,
<HI>Nec cirsumfuso pendebat in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere Tellus, ponderibas librata suis,</HI> nor did
the self-poiz'd Earth encompast round hang in soft Air; these Verses do seem
to glance at an <HI>Hypothesis</HI> I have formerly acquainted this Society with, some∣what
of which Mr. <HI>Newton</HI> hath Printed. <HI>Tellus, Pontus &amp; Aer,</HI> Earth,
Water, and Air were yet all confounded with each other, like Mortar or
Mud. <HI>Instabilis Tellus innabilis unda.</HI> The Earth unstable, Waves for Keels
unfit, which it comes to attain afterwards, and remains so for sometime, till
by degrees again it lost it when <HI>Astraea</HI> left it, which was just before the Gy∣gantomachia;
for <HI>Astraea,</HI> as I shall by and by make appear, is the Virgin
and primitive Smoothness and Stability of the superficial Parts of the Earth,
from (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) the first or Primitive, as (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Omega,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
stability, <HI>Et Virgo caede madentes ultima Caelicolum terras Astraea reliquit.</HI> The
last of Deities from Blood polluted Earth <HI>Astraea</HI> flies; for like moist Pap or
Mud, by degrees the watery and Aerial exhaleing, it settled into a smooth, ten∣der,
and uniform Substance, like the Youthful and Virgine Constitution, but
a farther separation of the Fluid Parts makes the Earthy, Dry, Rough, Rincl∣ed
and Chopt; inclining to the Countenance and Constitution of Age, and
the Virgin Beauty is fled: for a while there was a jumble, <HI>Corpora in uno,
frigida pugnabant Calidis, humentia siccis, mollia cum duris,</HI> the Cold, the Hot;
the Moist, the Dry ones fight; the Soft, the Hard, all incorporated strove
together, <HI>Sine pondere habentia pondus</HI> with weight, yet weightless, that is,
they all being Bodies had a capacity of being weighty, but a gravitating or
attracting Center not yet being existent, they had no actual Gravity any
way; but so soon as <HI>hanc Deus &amp; melior litem Natura diremit,</HI> God and the bet∣ter
Nature ends this War; that is, God and Nature had made the gravitat∣ing

a shining Fire like a Star or Sun, for its place was <HI>in arce,</HI> above all; within
this was Air.</P>

<HI>Sacra.</HI> Thus far, I suppose, it will easily be granted that the Poet gives us
a short History of the formation of the Earth, and 'tis as plain that the
twenty eight Verses following are to the same effect, wherein he describes the
cutting and forming the Face of the Earth into Lakes, Seas, Rivers, Hills,
Dales, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the dividing the whole into Zones, and assigning the use of Air,
for Clouds, Rain, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> nor has he yet Personated or Mithologized any thing,
but in the twenty ninth Verse following, <HI>viz.</HI> The sixtieth Verse of this first
Book he begins calling the Winds Brothers, <HI>Tanta est discordia <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> &amp;c.
the Sense of all the rest is plain till the eighty second Verse, where he be∣gins
again to personate Actions Mythologically; for speaking of the formati∣on
of Man,
<Q><L>—Natus homo est, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L>
<L>Sive recens tellus seducta{que} nuper ab alto</L>
<L>Aethere cognati ret inebat semina Coeli;</L>

<L>To Heav'n ally'd, which Earth <HI>Prometheus</HI> took</L>
<L>And mixt with Waters of a living Brook</L>
<L>Made Man like th' all-commanding Deities.</L></Q>
<P>From this place onwards he seems to Mythologize the most part of his
History, of which he gives notice in the eighty sixth and eighty seventh Ver∣ses.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>Sic modo quae fuerat rudis &amp; sine imagine Tellus</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>So what was rude and shapeless Earth, puts on</L>
<L>When chang'd, the unknown Character of Man.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>Hitherto he had spoken of things as Dead and Unactive Earth, but from
hence forth he will describe the Earth as changed and clothed with the vari∣ous
shapes of Men and Persons, and so having described the Formation or
first Generation of all things Physically and plainly, he comes next to tell the
Age or Ages of the World, and what Periods of Life or Being it hath had,
and the States it hath been in during those several Periods.</P>
<P>The first Age or Chilhood of the World he calls the Golden Age: Gold
is soft, flexible the most ductile of Metals, it has the best Lustre, and has al∣ways
had the greatest Esteem. This state of the Earth he represents to be
like that of Childhood, wherein all things are gay and pleasant, all things
flow plentifully and smoothly; the Skin or Shell is yet smooth, succulent and
soft, moisture and heat abound; so that things sprouted forth and flourish:
There is a continued Spring, all things are Budding, Blossoming, and bear∣ing
Fruit at the same time, no need of Art as yet to help the progress of
Nature forwards; or to regulate it, no one part of Nature intrenched, in∣vaded,
or hundred the free progress of another; there was plenty and e∣nough,
for all Rivers flowed with Milk and Nectar, and Honey drop'd from
the Leaves of Trees.</P>
<P>All these Poetical Expressions, which the Author seemeth to speak, as of
Men, and their Actions, and Enjoyments, I take to be significative of all
acting Powers of the Earth whether Vegetative or Animal, <HI>Per se dabar omnia
tellus, Vererat aeternum. Sponte sua sine lege fidem Rectumq; colebant.</HI> The Earth
gave all things of itself, Spring was Eternal, and Justice observ'd without
Law, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now, tho▪ all that happened in those times of the World, fell within the
Age which <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rro</HI> calls the <HI>Adelon Tempus;</HI> that is unknown as to the Heathen
Writers, yet I look upon this Account almost as considerable, if not more,
than those things which fall within the Mythologick; for I take this to be
the Summe and Epitomy of the Thoughts and Theories of the most ancient
and most knowing Philosophers among the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> and <HI>Greeks;</HI> and howmuch
soever there may be some who fllight and neglect and villify the Know∣ledge,
Doctrines and Theories of the Ancients, which Humor I am apt to
think proceeds from their ignorance of what they were, and the difficulty of
attaining the knowledge of them: Yet certainly former times wanted not for
Men altogether as eminent for Knowledge, Invention, and Reasoning as any
this present Age affords, if not far before them; for if we do believe a time
of the Creation or Production of this Earth (as we have somewhat more of
Argument to persuade us than possibly the Heathens had from the History
thereof written by <HI>Moses</HI>) then 'tis very rational to conclude, that in the
more Youthful Ages of the World, there was a much greater Perfection of
the Productions of it, and that before those many and great Alterations and
Catastrophies that have since happened, and before the senile Iron and de∣caying
Ages of the same, wherein every thing by degrees grew more Stiff,
<PB N="379" REF="359"/>
Rocky, Unactive and Barren, and so a degeneration of the Productions there∣by
seems a necessary Consequent. In the times, I say, that preceded all or
many of these, it seems very rational to conclude, that it might produce
Men of much longer Life, bigger Stature, and with greater accomplishments
of Mind (of all which we have very good Testimonies without the Argumen∣tations,
Histories, Traditions or Theories of the Heathen Writers) upon
which account tho' this Description of the Genesis of the Earth, and the first
Age of the World should be supposed to be but the Theory or Philosophy
of some of the most eminent Men, as <HI>Orpheus, Pythagoras,</HI> &amp;c. in Ages so
much nearer to those more active Ages of the Earth, yet, upon that ac∣count,
they may, I conceive, be well worth our inquiring into, to see, at
least, how Consonant those things are which they thought Reason, to that of
ours at this present. Some possibly may be of <HI>Aristotle's</HI> Opinion that the
Earth was eternal: But I am apt to think that such as are so, have not so
fully consulted their own Reason and Experience, nor much troubled them∣selves
with that Speculation. We found that the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Priests by that Pas∣sage
I quoted out of <HI>Plato,</HI> had the notion of the <HI>Genesis</HI> Mutations, Cata∣strophies,
by Fire and Water, and the like of the Earth, if we will not
allow them to have the History of them, or the Accounts of so many 1000 Years
as <HI>Plato</HI> mentions. But it will by some be required perhaps, by what means
can we judge of any such preceding Age? I answer, That possibly the petrified
Shells that lye in the Repository, and the prodigious Bones and Teeth that
have been found buried in the Earth, of which the Repository affords some
instances, and more might be fetched elsewhere: These, I say, might to
some unprejudiced Men prove Arguments, but for others 'tis best to let them
enjoy their own Thoughts. But to return to the Subject I was indeavouring
to prove, namely, That the Metamorphosis of <HI>Ovid</HI> was a continued account
of the Ages and Times of the duration of the Earth. I say, so far as I have
gone, namely, to the end of the Golden Age, none will doubt but that this
was the design of it, to relate what were the most celebrated Opinions con∣cerning
its Formation and first Ages, and as I conceive more particularly
that of <HI>Pythagaros,</HI> who had spread and left his Doctrines in <HI>Italy</HI> long before
<HI>Ovid</HI>'s time.</P>
<P>We come next to the 313 Verse where he begins to give an account, tho'
very short, of the Youthful time of the Earth, which he calls the Silver Age.
<HI>Postquam <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
gentea proles.</HI> After a long time was past and buried in Obscurity, the World
had got a new Face and was under the Regiment of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> which signified
the <HI>Aether</HI> and <HI>Celestial Fire;</HI> before this 'tis said in the Golden or infant Age
of the World, <HI>Ver <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at aeternum; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

driness is got into the Air. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
This ingress of <HI>Jupiter</HI> caused those strange changes in
the Air, that we in part now feel; for 'tis not immediately the heat of the
Sun that makes that difference in the heat of the Air, tho' that be also a
Cause. But as I shall have occasion to treat in an other place 'tis the Consti∣tution
of the Air, nor is it the oblique Radiation (is all which one consent af∣firme)
nor the nearness to, or distance from the Sun, but it is the ingress of
<HI>Jupiter</HI> that makes the Air susceptible of these Mutations. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

The Earth being now dried having lost much of its Infant softness and moi∣sture,
needed some helps to make the Seeds grow. After this iuvenile Age

Earth growing drier and drier, and the Air more intmperate, but yet it pro∣duced
no direful Effects of terraneous or aerial Catastrophies. But <HI>De <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<PB N="381" REF="360"/>
is introduced, all its Rocks and Iron Mines. <HI>Protinus Erupit venae
pejoris in aevum omne Nefas.</HI> Then followed all the dismal effects of Subterraneous
and Superterraneous Dissentions, Conflagrations, Floods, Earthquakes,
the Sea overwhelming the Lands, and the Lands getting out from under the Seas,
here Islands, there Lakes, here Mountains, there Voragoes and Abysses, and
multitudes of other Confusions which rased and mangled the superficial Parts
of the Earth, so that no place was free from the effects of these discordant
Principles. <HI>Astrea,</HI> as I said before, which signified the Virgin, <HI>Juvenile</HI>
smooth, soft, and even Face and Constitution of the Earth which it first re∣ceived
from the gentle Influence of the Heavens, and preserved in the In∣fant,
<HI>Juvenile</HI> and pretty well in the Virile or brazen Ages. Now, that
the Earth was arrived to its old Age, Wrinkles, Chops, Furrows, Scarrs,
and the like, had not left one spot of <HI>Astrea</HI> unblemish'd, then she is said to
have left it. This is a short account of this Iron or old Age of the World,
of which I suppose the whole following Metamorphosis is written; this in
good part falling within the Mythologick History of the Poets, but the Ge∣nesis
and three preceding Ages, I look upon to belong to <HI>Varroe's <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
tempus,</HI> and to be the Epitome of the Theories of the most antient and most
approv'd Philosophers. This I could in part prove, as I could also many o∣ther
Passages of this Discourse, by Quotations out of other Authors among
the Antient, and also by the consent of many more Modern Writers. But
that possibly might seem too tedious, and I doubt not but there are others
who having more applied their Studies that way will do it more fully. The
first of the memorable events of the Iron or old Age of the World is described
in the next following Verses.</P>
<LG>
<L>Neve foret terris securior arduus Aether,</L>
<L>Affectasse serunt Regnum caeleste Gigantes</L>
<L>Alta{que} congestos struxisse ad syder a montes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But least high Heav'n should unattempted rest,</L>
<L>Aspiring Thoughts the Giants Minds possest,</L>
<L>Mountains they rais'd' gainst the aetherial Throne.</L>
</LG>
<P>Now the dismal effects of the old Age of the Earth appear, the outward
Shell of the Earth being now hardned and petrified, and the Pores of Ema∣nation
stoped so that the fiery and watery Vapours and Rarefactions below
the same, could not now find their usual transits; these are said to conspire
against Heaven to break out of that Prison of <HI>Tartarus,</HI> where <HI>Jupiter</HI> had
lately thrust down and inclosed <HI>Saturn, Saturno tenebro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in tartara misso,</HI> and
to force their Passage into the open Heaven, where <HI>Jupiter</HI> now prevails;
these therefore fermenting together had raised the subterraneous Parts into
many Cavities and <HI>Cryptae,</HI> and therefore were said to have a thousand Hands,
being so many Caverns and far extending <HI>Cryptae,</HI> wherein these subterrane∣ous
Sprits convened, in which lay their strength; and because such <HI>Cryptae,</HI> are
winding and not streight, they were called <HI>Anguipedes</HI> like Snakes; these at
last break forth and make Mountains, lay <HI>Pelion</HI> upon <HI>Ossa, Alta{que} congestos
struxere ad sidera montes.</HI> Then <HI>Jupiter</HI> is said to have rent the Heavens with
his Lightning and to have buried them at last with Mountains heaped on
them; that is, these Vapours having made Eruptions and thereby carried
the Earth up with them, so as to make Mountains one of the top of the
other, the Vapour got into the Air where it produced hideous Lightning and
so spent it self in the Air, and the Mountains being left, and the Vapours
that raised them spent, <HI>Jupiter</HI> is said to have destroyed them and buried
them under those Mountains: One of these is said to be buried under <HI>Sicily,</HI>
and to breath through the Mountain <HI>Aetna.</HI> But I must not stay too long
upon the particular Explication of every thing concerning it, it may be suffi∣cient
for me at present to hint the meaning in general; only 'tis to be noted,
that the Blood of these produced a generation that was of the same kind;
that is, that the remainders in the Earth were of the same kind.</P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="361"/>
These remainders of the first Effects were so prodigious that they made
<HI>Jupiter</HI> groan and grow white hot with Anger, that is, made Thunder and
Lightning, and call a Council of the Gods,</P>

<P>It seems this was as great a Conflagration, or Collection of subterraneous
Spirits, and like to be as dreadful as the preceding, nay greater, for that was
but one single Enemy, but one small part to be destroyed; but now there is
an universal defection, all must be destroy'd; for speaking of the last Eruption,

<L>Now where so'ere the silver Waves are spread,</L>
<L>I must destroy Mankind.</L>

<P>And why must all this be? Why <HI>Jupiter</HI> being informed of this designed

the <HI>Semidei, Fauni, Nymphae, Satyri,</HI> and <HI>Sylvni,</HI> that were the terrer∣strial
Deities of the Plains, Rivers, Woods and Hills; but even <HI>Jupiter</HI> him∣self,
who ruled the celestial Deities, the Aether, Air and Meteors, all which
he had call'd together, who

<P>But who is this <HI>Lycaon?</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> as the Word signifies, is Dissolution,
the general Congregation of the Sulphureous, Subterraneous Vapours being e∣very
where pent in, threaten'd a general Dissolution and Catastrophy of the
whole World at once, and so would not only overturn Hills, Plains, Rivers
and Woods, but set on Fire and destroy the Air; for, as in another place he
expresses it,

<P>The same white tops of Mountains, the same gaping devouring Mouth,
the same flaming Eyes, the <HI>Caldera</HI> at the top yielding Fire, the same fright∣ful
and terrible Aspect, like that of a devouring Wolf; and that this is the
meaning of the shape of a Wolf which <HI>Lycaon</HI> is said to be transformed into,
is more plain by what is said in the eleventh Book, Verse 365, of <HI>Psamathes</HI>
being turned into a Wolf, where <HI>Antenor</HI> is introduced telling a story to <HI>Peleus</HI>
of a devouring Wolf destroying Men and Cattle which had come out of the
Sea: It will be plain to any that shall read it, that an Earthquake is there
meant by the description of the Wolf, but I must not now insist upon it.</P>
<P>But to proceed, there was yet but a stop put to some small <HI>Vulcano</HI> or Erup∣tion
which had destroyed but some small Country <HI>de Gente Molossa,</HI> some of
which it had overflowed with Water, and destroy'd some other parts with
Fire.</P>

<P>But this was not sufficient to vent these subterraneous imprison'd Spirits;
but an universal Catastrophy was necessary, because <HI>Erynnis</HI> ruled over the whole

whether by an universal Conflagration by fiery Eruptions</P>

</LG></Q>
<P>He concludes at last to do it by an Inundation.</P>
<P>But I must not dwell too long upon the Explication, which with this notion
will plainly appear to him that reads the Poet's Description. Next this fol∣lows
the Story of <HI>Python,</HI> which is nothing but the Corruption and ill effects
of it from the Mud and Stagnations left by the Flood, which the Sun by its
Rays by degrees destroys, drying it up. And the next of <HI>Daphne</HI> turned into
a Laurel by <HI>Apollo,</HI> is nothing but the pleasant verdures the Sun produced
upon the Earth, inriched by the Inundation after it was dried. I could pro∣ceed,
but I fear I have already wearied you with this Recital, which was on∣ly
designed as a Specimen to shew what I hinted the last Day, namely, That
this Mythologick History was a History of the Production, Ages, States and
Changes that have formerly happened to the Earth, partly from the Theory
of the best Philosophy; partly from Tradition, whether Oral or Written,
and partly from undoubted History, for towards the latter end we find ac∣counts
of many things our Histories reach, as <HI>Orpheus,</HI> the <HI>Trojan</HI> War, <HI>Py∣thagoras,
Romulus, Rome, Numa,</HI> and it comes down even to the Death of <HI>Ju∣lius
Caesar,</HI> and the Reign of <HI>Augustus,</HI> under whom he lived.</P>
<P><HI>IN Confirmation of what is said in the foregoing Page concerning the</HI> Giants, <HI>I
shall here insert a loose Paper as I found it among Dr.</HI> Hook<HI>'s Manuscripts, in∣scribed,
A Copy of Dr.</HI> Thomas Gale<HI>'s Paper concerning</HI> Giants.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>R. W.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>IN Answer to your Question about the word</HI> Rephaim <HI>and</HI> Gigantes, <HI>I make
this short return.</HI></P>
<P>1. There is no rudical word in the Hebrew Language whose signification doth at all
lead us to understand <HI>Gigantes</HI> by the word <HI>Rephaim,</HI> so, that the Radix of <HI>Re∣phaim</HI>
is either lost as to the present Hebrew Language (as many others are) or else
that word <HI>Rephaim</HI> is a foreign word to that Language, as many more such are now
found in the Bible.</P>
<P>2. The Septuagint Translators do often render Hebrew words not according to their
Natural Sense, but with respect to some History or Tradition, or general belief pre∣vailing
at that time: The reason was because those Translators lived among Greeks
at <HI>Alexandria:</HI> And they were desirous to shew that the Bible was not unaquainted
with the Greek Stories, where the thing could be done without injury to their Books.</P>
<P>3. In their rendring of the word <HI>Rephaim</HI> by <HI>Gigantes</HI> and <HI>Mortui,</HI> and the
Verb—they plainly point at the Story of the <HI>Titanes,</HI> who in the Greek
Mythologies are said <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> St. <HI>Jude</HI> uses the same word when he speaketh
of the Hellish Angels, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Another Greek Translator rendereth the
same word Rephaim by Titanes.</P>
<P>4. As to the suspicion that the <HI>Gigantomachia</HI> was an Earthquake, or perhaps se∣veral
Earthquakes, but by the Poets put altogether, the true notation of the word
<HI>Gigas</HI> seems to make for you. In Hebrew the <HI>Radix Gagash,</HI> is <HI>terra commota
fuit.</HI> And the Substantive <HI>Gigas,</HI> tho' commonly taken for a Greeks word, is indeed
of Hebrew or Phaenician. Original. In that place of <HI>Isaiah</HI> where the 70 use <HI>Gi∣gantes,
Symmachus</HI> uses <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, both alluding to the Poetical Fable, but the
70 do it more warily, <HI>Symmachus</HI> more plainly.</P>
<P><PB N="385" REF="364"/>
But to me I confess it seems rather to allude to the fourth Verse of the
sixth Chapter of <HI>Genesis,</HI> where it is said, that there were Giants in the Earth
in those Days, because the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is made use of by the Septua∣gint
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and it seems to be a full
Period, besides we find that God immediately after this Passage, is said to be
very highly displeased with the wickedness of Mankind at that time upon
the Earth, and to resolve their Destruction and Extirpation, which shews
that there is a great agreement of the Poets Mythology with this History of
<HI>Moses:</HI> For <HI>Ovid</HI> makes this <HI>Gigantomachia</HI> to precede the Flood of <HI>Deuca∣lion,</HI>
as the Scripture doth make this to precede that of <HI>Noah.</HI> And besides
joins the Fable of <HI>Lycaon</HI> to that of his Giants, which seems plainly to al∣lude
to the wickedness of Men mentioned by <HI>Moses</HI> upon this occasion. Fur∣ther,
I do not know whether the word may not sometime have been used to
denominate Earthquakes, or subterraneous Powers; for in the ninth Verse of
the fourteenth of <HI>Isaiah</HI> where the same word is used by the seventy. It
seems plainly to signify some such thing; but this is besides my Province,
and I shall rather leave it to the Divines to determine: For <HI>Gigas</HI> is the same
word with the Greek word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which <HI>Eustachius</HI> derives from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
that is an Off-spring or Progeny of the Earth, <HI>i. e.</HI> somewhat generated in
the Bowels or Womb of the Earth and thence Born, brought forth or pro∣truded,
which is a very proper Appellation and Description of that pro∣duction
of Nature, wherewith the Earth seems to be first impregnated and
made tame, then to be in great Agony and Pangs, and to have many pangs
and throws before it is delivered of it; and last of all to produce Islands,
Mountains, or the like Monsters, which seem to threaten or aspire at the
Celestial Mansions.</P>
<P>When I gave an account the preceding Meeting, <HI>July</HI> the thirteenth, of
what I conceived the Poets meant by the Mythology of the Giants warring with
the Gods, some of the Society then present were very Inquisitive to be in∣formed
what should be meant by the History of <HI>Python</HI> which was destroy'd by
<HI>Apollo,</HI> of which though I had made some mention in a former Discourse con∣cerning
the Mythology mention'd by <HI>Ovid,</HI> yet being then only mention'd
<HI>in transitu,</HI> I have now somewhat more particularly drawn up my Sentiment
concerning it. I mention'd before then <HI>Ovid</HI> by this Mythology (as I con∣ceived)
did design to describe the state of the Earth from its first beginning and
formation out of a <HI>Chaos,</HI> through all the various Alterations, Changes and
Metamorphoses it had undergon even to that time in which he lived. And
therein to comprise the Traditions and Opinions of the Antients, and possibly
also some of the Moderns of his Times, and some also of his own, thereby
to give some Account and some Reasons of the then present Phaenomena of
the World. I need not repeat what I have formerly instanced in, about the
<HI>Chaos</HI> and the Ages succeeding, nor what I said concerning the Fable of the
<HI>Giants:</HI> But to make the probability of my Conjectures the more manifest, I
would observe to you the Co-haerence and Connexion of the Mythologies, as
they are ranged in this first Book. After the War of the <HI>Giants</HI> which had
raised up Mountains that seemed to threaten the very Heavens by their height,
and the disturbances that had thereby been caused in the Air by Lightning
and Storms which he makes to be the means by which the Gods destroy'd
their fury, he comes to consider the Face of the Earth as it was left, which
he Mythologizes by the Story of <HI>Lycaon,</HI> whereby he describes the confusion
there was left by the subversion, sinking, overwhelming and destructions that
had been made, the <HI>Rustica Numina</HI> as the <HI>Fauri, Nymphae, Satyri,</HI> and the <HI>Syl∣vani</HI>
of the Mountains, were all likely to be destroyed for the future; that is,
the fine Plains, the Woods, the Rivers and Rivulets, the Woods on the Hills
were all deformed, confounded, and put into confusion, and not only so but
the Air itself was from the Clefts and Chasms poisoned and continually filled with
noxious, Expirations out of the Earth, the People remaining were di∣stracted
and grown barbarous, preying upon and destroying one another; it
was thought therefore by <HI>Jupiter,</HI> i. e. Divine Power, necessary, that all must
be set to rights again by a general Deluge, whereupon the Poet brings in <HI>Jupiter</HI>
Swearing,</P>
<Q><PB N="386" REF="365"/>
<LG>
<L>Nunc mihi qua totum Nereus circumsonat orbem</L>

<L>All ways first try; But th' incurable Wound</L>
<L>Must be cut off, lest it insect the Sound.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>The Flood then follows that was to reduce this torn and confounded Face
of things into some better Form and Order,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fable of <HI>Deucalion</HI> and the Flood explained.</NOTE> by which the Caverns left
should be filled, the ruggednesses plain'd, the superficial Parts, now Rocks and
Stones, and the Recrements of the Eruptions should be cover'd by a more
soft, and fine, and fatter Skin of Earth, which should be fit to produce and
nourish Vegetables and Animals as before. The Poet then describes the
Flood, and thereby makes all Men and other Creatures to perish by it, ex∣cept
only <HI>Deucalion</HI> and <HI>Pyrrha,</HI> who were to be the restorers of Mankind,
whom he supposed to have somewhat more Divine than all the rest of the
Creatures, which he conceived to be generable out of Corruption, as you
will see by and by; but Man only by propagation, yet his method of Pro∣pagation
looks at first glance but very extravagant, namely, from Stones
cast behind them by <HI>Deucalion,</HI> and <HI>Pyrrha, Deucalion</HI>'s being generated into
Men, and <HI>Pyrrha</HI>'s transformed to Women (<HI>quis hoc credat nisi sit pro teste Ve∣tustas)</HI>
says <HI>Ovid;</HI> and I am very apt to think that <HI>Ovid</HI> himself was one of the
Unbelievers, notwithstanding the Testimony of the old Traditions, that is,
that he did not take it to be a truth in the plain Sense of the Words, tho'
he seems to draw a Consequence from them. [<HI>Inde genus durum sumus experiens{que}
Laborum.</HI>] But that he understood what was meant or intended to be signi∣fied
by this Mythologick Description [<HI>Et Document a damus qua sumus origine na∣ti.</HI>]
But to proceed. After he has told us how Mankind was preserved and
propagated after the Deluge, he next comes to the other Creatures.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>Caetera diversis, Tellus animalia, formis</L>
<L>Sponte sua peperit; postquam vetus humor ab igne</L>

<L>By Steps and Time both Growth and Shape assume.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>And here he is for <HI>Aequivocal</HI> Generation to the height, if you under∣stand
him literally, or according to the words, <HI>Quippe ubi temperiem Sumpsere
Humor{que} calor{que} concipiunt &amp; ab his oriuntur cuncta duobus.</HI> All came from two
Principles; for he seems to make all things to arise or be generated out of a
temperature of Heat and Moisture, and by that means the Earth, when left
by the Deluge, abounding with muddy and boggy Places the heat of the Sun
working thereupon produced, according to him, not only all the several
Creatures a new which had been lost and destroyed by the Deluge, but di∣vers
others of strange,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fables of <HI>Python</HI> ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/></NOTE> and before unknown, and monstrous Forms, which
were terrible and destructive to Mankind, and amongst the rest he mentions
a strange, venomous and prodigious <HI>Serpent,</HI> which he calls <HI>Python,</HI> which he
<PB N="387" REF="366"/>
relates to be killed or destroyed by the Darts of <HI>Apollo.</HI> By which I conceive
no more is meant, but that those boggy Places after a time corrupted and
produced pestilential, dark, Clouds and Vapours, which frighted and was noxi∣ous
both to Men and Beasts.</P>
<P>But that in some time after the Rays of the Sun and Lightning having
prevailed, did thereby burn off and discharge the poisonous Exhalations, and
put an end to that monstrous off-spring, nor need we be much concerned for
what the <HI>Daemonologers</HI> had thereupon superstructed for the promoting and
carrying on of their <HI>Theourgy.</HI> After this drying of the boggy places of the
Earth by the Sun; we have the account of the production of Woods and Trees
by the Power of the Sun in the Story of <HI>Daphne:</HI> And then the description of
the Rain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Daphne.</NOTE> Dew and the Foggs that moistened the Air, and made Rivulets and
Streams producing Grass in the Fields, and greenness on Trees and Plants by

the Stars to watch it by Night and cause it to fall: But <HI>Mercury,</HI> or the light
of the Morning cuts off the head of <HI>Argus,</HI> that is, makes the Stars disap∣pear
and the Sun return to raise them, and <HI>Io</HI> is then restored to her former
Shape, or the Dew or Moisture on the Ground is raised into Vapours. By
the bye he inserts the Generation of Water, and River-plants by <HI>Syrinx,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Syrinx.</NOTE> and
the production of the <HI>Rain-bow</HI> by the Head of <HI>Argus,</HI> placed by <HI>Juno</HI> or the
power of the Air in the Feathers of <HI>Juno</HI>'s Bird, which are the Clouds of the
Air. By these Mythologies having described the postdiluvian state of the
Waters, and the Air and watery Meteors, he ends the Book with the Pedi∣gree
of <HI>Phaeton</HI> which he compleats in the beginning of the next, of which
hereafter.</P>
<P>But as to <HI>Python,</HI> which gave the occasion of my present Discourse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pytkon.</NOTE> 'tis
plain that its Name signifies Corruption, and by the manner of its Genera∣tion,
'tis evident that he supposes this Corruption to be caused by the Bog∣giness
or Floods that remained in the Plains, Lakes, or Holes, lower
Grounds or Vales incompassed with higher Grounds that the Water could
not run off: From the fermentation of the softned Earth he sup∣poses
the Animals to be formed that were of the same form with the <HI>Ante∣diluvian;</HI>
but from a longer stay of the Waters this fermentation turned to
Corruption, and then produced not only Monstrous Creatures, but noxious
and dreadful Exhalations, whence proceeded Distempers and Diseases,
because these Waters by several Streams moved (as most commonly they do)
to lower Places and Cavities and there made a great Body which possessed a
considerable part of the incompassing Hills or Mountains: <HI>Apollo or Jupiter,</HI>
that is, the Sun by many Days and Years irradiating with its Darts, Rays or
Beams, doth partly dry by Exhalations, partly by flashes of Lightning, dis∣sipate,
and dispel, and last of all it causeth Clefts and openings of the Earth
which swallow it up, and leave those Cavities like the black Wounds which the
Post affirms to remain for a witness to Posterity.</P>

<P>The Earth produced various Creatures some monstrously shaped, these
were <HI>invita terra</HI> contrary to its proper teeming Vertue brought forth: Of
these one was more corrupt than the rest, and more contrary to Nature;
this possessing so much room of the Mountains, wrigling on all sides by the
Rills that ran into its vast Body or Lake, by its Poison became dreadful to
the new produced Creatures: This Celestial Power that kept the Tower of
Heaven (so I English <HI>Arcitenens</HI>) that is, the Sun, Fire, or Heat, by its
Rays and by thousands of flashes of Lightnings (insomuch that one would
have thought they had been all spent and the whold stock fired off and where∣as
those Rays before had been only used to dispel and scatter small Clouds or
Foggs) did hereby at last destroy or disperse this stagnant and corrupted Bo∣dy
of Water, by causing it to rise into Thunder Clouds discharging by Light∣ning
its poisonous Vapours with which it swelled; besides the heat of the
Sun and the Lightning also kindling the Subterraneous Spirits, caused Clefts
and Chasms in the Earth, which swallowed up most of the remaining stag∣nant
Waters, and so destroy'd the Cause or Original of those Evils, leaving
in several places divers of those Chasms or black Wounds which the Poet
describes.</P>
<P>To this purpose there is a notable Passage in <HI>Lucian,</HI> which, among others,
to another intent, is quoted by Dr. <HI>Burnet, Theor. Sacr.</HI> Part 2. Chap. 4. “These
are the Matters (says <HI>Lucian</HI>) which the Greeks have related concerning
the Flood of <HI>Deucalion.</HI> But among the things that have happened soon af∣ter
it, there is a certain relation of the Inhabitants of <HI>Hieraep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> which is
justly looked upon with great admiration, namely, that in their Country
there had happened to be made a great Chasme in the Earth, which had
swallowed up all the remaining Waters; whereupon <HI>Deucalion</HI> had built Al∣tars
and a Temple dedicated to <HI>Juno</HI> over the <HI>fame.</HI> Now for a sign that
this Relation is so, they do thus twice every Year, Water is brought from the
Sea to this Temple, and not only the Priests bring it, but all <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>A∣rabia,</HI>
and many which dwell beyond the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uphrates, go to the Sea and fetch∣ing
the Water from hence bring it to this place: And first indeed
they pour it out into the Temple, and then it runs into the Chasm, and tho'
this Chasm be but small, yet it swallows an immense quantity of Water.
When they perform this Ceremony, they siv that De<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>calun instituted this
Rite and Law of this Temple, that it might be a Memorial as well of the
Destruction by as of the Deliverance and Safety procured against the Flood.
This (says <HI>Lucian</HI>) is the old Story concerning this Temple.” This Tradi∣tion
'tis very probable, <HI>Ovid</HI> was not ignorant of and might therefore add to
his Relation <HI>Fuso per vulnera nigra veneno. Nerve operts famam posset del<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e vetusta.</HI> And 'tis very probable also that the Mythology of <HI>Argns</HI> has a respect to the
Generation of the Rainbow soon after the Flood as it is mentioned by <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>
For 'tis plain that their Signs or Hieroglyphical Representations and Notions,
were many of them abundantly more incongruous with the things signified
than this is; for Clouds may by an easy Figure be fancied the Fowls or Birds
of the Air, as we usually say when great flakes of Snow fall, the Winter is
plucking its Geese of Fowls: And which among all Fowls, or indeed Crea∣tures,
does better represent the Rainbow then the Peacock when it spreads its
Tail, whereby it represents such a glorious Arching of a most stupendious Va∣riety
<PB N="389" REF="368"/>
of Colours as numerous and as resplendent as the very Rainbow. And
to make the coherence the greater those Rings being made up of a Circular
Order of beautiful Spots, what could he better Metamorphose it from than
from a Head adorned with abundance of Eyes, which he makes to be of one
<HI>Argus?</HI> I suppose for want of Microscopes he knew not that the Eyes of
Flies were planted in so curious an order, otherwise possibly that might have
served for a Hieroglyphick for the Star-light-Night as well as <HI>Argus.</HI></P>
<P>I have formerly discoursed concerning the great and strange Effects that
have been produced on the superficial Parts of the Earth by means of Earth∣quakes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The occasion of this Lecture.</NOTE>
the raising of Hills, the sinking of Vallies and Lakes, the swallow∣ing
and new producing of Rivers, the raising and sinking of Islands, the
cleaving of Hills and Rocks, and the tumbling and disordering of the super∣ficial
Parts of the Earth, by which means have been produced the Veins and
various mixtures in Marbles and other kinds of Stone, and most of the pe∣trifactive
Productions, besides the Production of Mines and Metalline Bodies,
as well as of other Saline, Sulphureous and divers other mineral Substances.
And in short I conceive that the whole Surface of the Earth, as it is at pre∣sent,
has been some ways or other influenced and shaped by them: I have on
several occasions alledged several Arguments and Observations to make these
Conceptions probable, and have produced several Histories that seem
to be that way conducing. But most of the greatest Mutations having in
probability been performed in the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the uncertain or
fabulous Times, as they are termed by <HI>Varro,</HI> there is not to be found in the
Historical time very many that do make much for it; the greatest Instance I
conceive to be had of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That the <HI>Egyp∣tians</HI> had Re∣cords of <HI>Phae∣ton</HI> in their Histories.</NOTE> is the History of <HI>Phaeton,</HI> which, tho' among the
Greeks it be included within the fabulous times, yet it seems by that Passage
of <HI>Plato</HI> which he relates concerning what <HI>Solon</HI> had learned from the <HI>Aegypti∣an
Preist</HI> that the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> had Records thereof in their History, as in
probability they had of many others, of which the <HI>Grecians</HI> were wholly igno∣rant,
as may in part appear by the Relation of the <HI>Atlantis;</HI> for the <HI>Greeks</HI>
had nothing of History elder than the Flood of <HI>Oygges,</HI> which, as <HI>Eusebius</HI>
says, happened about the times of <HI>Jacob,</HI> which was long after that of <HI>Noah,</HI>
and long before that of <HI>Deucalion,</HI> which was about the latter end of <HI>Moses's</HI>
Life. All which time according to <HI>Varro,</HI> and many hundred Years after e∣ven
to the beginning of the <HI>Olympiads</HI> (which was but 776 Years before
Christ) was included in the Fabulous Age, which was likewise 776 Years after
<HI>Moses</HI> his Death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">At what time that happened.</NOTE> he dying in the 1552 Year before Christ's Nativity; within
which space of time the Catastrophy Mythologised by the Story of <HI>Phaeton</HI>
seems to have happened; for <HI>Orosius</HI> relates it to have been much about the
time of the <HI>Israelites</HI> departure out of <HI>Aegypt;</HI> as he doth also assert that of
<HI>Deucalion</HI>'s Flood, in which the greatest part of the People of <HI>Thessaly</HI> were
lost, only some few escaping who fled to the Mountains, especially <HI>Parnassus,</HI>
near the Foot of which <HI>Deucalion</HI> then reigned. Now if we consider the Story
as it is related by <HI>Ovid</HI> in the second Book of his <HI>Metamorphosis,</HI> making al∣lowance
for what is Poetically spoken, one may plainly enough from the
whole drift of the Fable conjecture at the History or Tradition that is couch∣ed
under it, as well as somewhat also of the Philosophy; as for the morality
thereof enough have taken notice of and writ concerning it. As for the time
of it, <HI>Ovid</HI> places it soon after the Fable of <HI>Deucalion</HI> which is the seventh
Fable of his first Book; and the eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelvth, are of
Matters consequential of that Flood which must have followed it in a very
short time (as I may on some other occasion make more probable) or rather
praevious to this, as being indeed part of it. But to let that pass for the pre∣sent,
I shall only take notice now of the Physical or Philosophical part thereof,
which to me seems to contain a Description of some very great Earthquake
or fiery Eruption which affected a great part of the World then known.</P>
<P>First then we find <HI>Phaeton</HI> to be termed a Son or production of the Sun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Explication of the Fable of <HI>Phaeton.</HI></NOTE>
which is the biggest and most powerful Fire of the World, that we who live
upon the Earth do know, but by the Mothers Side, to be the Son of <HI>Clymene</HI>
which is an epithite of <HI>Pluto</HI> and denotes <HI>Phaeton,</HI> or this aspiring Fire to be
generated by the Sun in the Bowels of the Earth; all the proeme of the
<PB N="390" REF="369"/>
Story is Poetical and of a moral Signification to denote a Genius aspiring and
undertaking more than what it was able or fit to perform and manage, yet
it is so ordered as to comprise the main Design and Physical meaning of the
Poet, <HI>viz.</HI> that by some extraordinary or universal influence of the Suns
Beams the Subterraneous Vapours had been kindled, and that a fore-runner
of this was Lightning and Thunderings in the Air, which seems to be expres∣sed
by the description of the Horses that drew the Chariot of the Sun.</P>

<L>Metam. Lib. 2. v. 153, &amp;c.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>The Managery and Course of the Horses and Chariots through the Hea∣vens
is all poetical, accommodated to shew the Constellations of <HI>Aratus,</HI> and to
the Cosmography of the Poets, to signify the concurrence of the other Ce∣lestial
Bodies and Powers: But the effects it produced on the Earth as the
flaming and burning of Mountains, the cleaving and chopping of the Earth,
the swallowing up of Rivers, the rising of Lands out of the Sea, as especial∣ly
that about <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and the Sandy Deserts on the West side of it, seem to
be Historical as well as Poetical.</P>
<P>But I confess the whole is so Poetical that much certainty of History cannot
be fetched out of it; yet for the present let me add thus much that I conceive
may be deduced therefrom, and that is this, That there was an ancient Tra∣dition
among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and that there was an ancient History among the
<HI>Aegyytians</HI> of some very great and almost general Conflagration or Eruption
of fiery Streams which made very great Devastations on the Earth, especi∣ally
of those parts mentioned by the Poet in this Relation; such as <HI>Athos,
Ida, Oete, Tmolus, Taurus, Helicon, Aemus, Aetna, Parnassus, Othry, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
Erix, Mimas, Rhodope, Dindyma, Caucasus, Mycale, Cytheron, Dindus ad Ossa,
Olympus,</HI> the <HI>Alpes</HI> and <HI>Appenine,</HI> all which Mountains, are said to have been
on Fire, and to have cast up Smoak, Ashes, and burning Coles, and to have
thickned and darkned the Air.</P>
<Q><LG>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then a dry Desert <HI>Libya</HI> became,</L>
<L>Her full Veins empty'd by the thirsty Flame;</L>
<L>With their scorcht Hair the Nymphs the dry'd up Stream;</L>
<L>And Lakes, their ancient seats, bewad.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>Then were cast up the <HI>Libyan</HI> Desarts and many Lakes and Rivers swallow∣ed
up and perverted, the names of which the Poet mentions, which are too
many now to repeat; then the other parts of the Earth were cleft and tumbl∣ed
to and fro.</P>

<L>The Ocean shrinks and leaves a Field of Sand,</L>

<L>Which multiply the scatter'd Cyclades.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>Then was the Sea contracted into a narrower but deeper Cestern, the Hills
and Lands on each side of it raised from under the former Sea and made dry
Lands and Mountains, the Islands that are now dispersed in it were thrust up
out of its bottom, and stand in that Position to this time: In short not to de∣tain
you at present too long upon this Mythologick Story, I conceive it to
contain the History or <HI>Cabala</HI> of the Production or Birth of the present <HI>Me∣diterranean,
Aegean</HI> and <HI>Euxine</HI> Seas, and of all the bordering Shores and
Countries near adjacent to them, together with all the Islands, Peninsula's,
Cliffs Promontories, Mountains, Hills, Lakes, Rivers and Countries which
had been before that time all covered with the Sea, but by a prodigious Ca∣tastrophy
which Divine Providence then caused to be effected, the former
Face of those Parts was transformed and metamorphosed into much what it is
now found, in General, tho' not in all Particulars; for that there may have
since been by the same Divine Providence produced other particular Cata∣strophies
and Mutations, of which there are many Instances mythologically
Recorded in this our Author, some of which I have already mentioned, and
divers others which I may have occasion to mention some other time, be∣sides
divers others of which we have plain and not hitherto doubted or disputed
Histories. Now, tho' I confess what I have here asserted to be seemingly ve∣ry
Extravagant and Heterodox from the general Conceptions of most that
have had occasion to mention this Fable; and tho' it had been less impro∣bable,
I should not have expected any Concurrence of Opinion: Yet possibly
when the Matter has beeen more sedately and without prejudice thought of
and examined, it may, as well as some of my former Extravagancies, receive
at least a more mild Censure, tho' it should not be wholly accommodated to
the Gusto of every such Examinant. In these Matters Geometrical Cogen∣cy
has not yet been applied, and where that is wanting, Opinion, which is
always various and unstable, prevails. However, I may on some other oc∣casion
shew that there is to be found in Physick, as well as Geometry, unan∣werable Probation.</P>
<P>And when the Extravagancy and Novelty of the Doctrine has run the
Gauntlet of Censures, I shall indeavour to add somewhat to cover and cure its
Scars.</P>
<P>I did the last day indeavour to shew what I conceived was veiled by the Poet
under the Story of <HI>Phaeton,</HI> and that was this, That by this Mythology the
<HI>Grecian</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Poets did preserve the memory of some extraordinary great
Catastrophy, which all the parts of the Earth or Countries not far removed
from the <HI>Mediterranean, Aegean, Euxine,</HI> and <HI>Caspian</HI> Seas had suffered by fiery
Eruptions or Meteors, effecting Earthquakes.</P>
<P>This to me seems probable from the Order and from the Manner of the
whole Relation.</P>
<P>For the Order of it; we find it placed by <HI>Ovid</HI> soon after the Flood of
<HI>Deucalion,</HI> and so we find it is related by <HI>Paulus Orosius</HI> (which I hinted the last
day) for in the ninth and tenth Chap. of his first Book of Historys he makes
the Flood of <HI>Deucalion</HI> to have happened much about the time of the Plagues
of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and the Passage of the <HI>Israelites</HI> through the Red Sea, by which
Flood the greatest part of the People of <HI>Thessaly</HI> were destroyed. <HI>Quo</HI> (says
<HI>Orosius,</HI> speaking of that Flood) <HI>Major pars populorurm Thessaliae absumpta est,
paucis perfugio Montium Liberatis. Maxime in monte Parnasso, in Cujus Circuitu
Deucalion tunc Regnabat; qui ad se consugientes Ratibus Suscepit &amp; per germina

Dicatur. Impressnm{que} Fervorem &amp; Aethiop, plus Solito, &amp; insolitum Scytha non
tulerit. Ex quo etiam quidam, dum non concedunt Deo ineffabilem potentiam suam,
Inanes Ratiunculas conquirentes Ridiculam Phaetontis Fabulam texuerunt.</HI> Thus
far he, by which it seems that <HI>Orosius</HI> did, in the Stories of <HI>Deucalion</HI> and <HI>Phae∣ton</HI>
for the main, believe the Matters of Fact to be true, but he was not for
giving a Philosophical Conjecture at the Causes of it, or the ascribing them
to the Pagan Deities, but for ascribing it immediately to the ineffable Power
of God.</P>
<P>Now I do not conceive it doth any ways detract from the Omnipotency and
Power of God, to explain the Causes that he was pleased to make praevi∣ous
to those Effects: For the Power of God is not less wonderful, in pro∣ducing
and disposing the Causes of things, than in producing the things more
immediately. But such a Story as this Fable of <HI>Phaeton</HI> is, and to give such an ac∣count
of its Causes, as the Poets have there given, if understood literally, seems
sufficiently ridiculous, and impious. But it is easy enough to be seen that
those who made this Fable knew better things, and only made use of Mytho∣logy
to conceale their knowledge from the Vulgar, and yet communicate it to
such as had the Key to unfold the Mystery contained therein.</P>
<P>And this appears plain enough from the whole series also of the History;
for as I noted before, <HI>Phaeton</HI> is said to be produced or generated by the Sun
in the Womb of <HI>Clymene,</HI> an Epithite of <HI>Pluto,</HI> that is, in the Subterraneous Re∣gions;
and that it is so understood, appears plainly by the behaviour of <HI>Cly∣mene,</HI>
who is said, after the Death of her Son, to have been <HI>Lugubris
&amp; amens, &amp; Laniata Sinus totum percensuit orbem, exanimes{que} Artus primo, mox
ossa requirens.</HI> Which seems to denote the murmuring and tumbling in the
Earth that continued after the Conflagration was over, and the Story of the
Sisters of <HI>Phaeton</HI> seems very consonant also thereunto if I had time now to
consider them.</P>
<P><HI>Phaeton</HI> being grown to maturity, is said to have a great desire to know his
Father, whom <HI>Clymene</HI> directs to go to the Palace of the Sun; that is, the
Vapours being copiously generated in the Earth are expelled into the Air as∣cending
towards the Sun. <HI>Phaeton</HI> is said to have come at length to the Pa∣lace
of the Sun, and there to have been much pleased with the glorious work
thereof, and more especially with the Workmanship of <HI>Vulcan</HI> in the Gates.

this, That the state of the World before this Catastrophy was much the
same (<HI>facies nou omnibus una, nec diversa tamen</HI>) with the State of it after∣wards;
that is, the Course of the Sun was through the twelve Signs; there
was a Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter, as there has been since; no alte∣ration
of the Axis or obliquity of the Ecliptick: But there were Ages, and
Years, and Months, and Days, and Hours as now; and <HI>Phaebus</HI> describing
the way to drive his Chariot through, doth name the same Constellations:
So that the Philosophers who made the Theory, or the Poets that made the
Fable, did not understand or suppose the obliquity of the Ecliptick to be made
by that Deviation of the Chariot, or that this Catastrophy had altered the
Axis of the Earth, with respect to the Heavens. But neither did they
design to signify, even by this Story, the Deviation of the Sun it self at that
time, as if that had descended and fired the Earth: For <HI>Phaebus</HI> did not ac∣company
the Chariot, <HI>Occupat ille levem juvenili corpore currum,</HI> v. 150. But
<PB N="393" REF="372"/>
they rather seem to make <HI>Phaeton</HI> a fiery Meteor proceeding from the East,
and moving Westward by another way and course than the Sun usually took,
and differing from the Direction that <HI>Phaebus</HI> had given to <HI>Phaeton</HI> to observe:
But his Horses now mounted upwards towards the fixt Stars, now down∣wards
towards the Earth, now far to the North, then as much to the South;
and last of all he was broak all to peices by Lightning, and fell down like a
Meteor upon the Earth, and like some such Meteors as have of late Years
been observed, but much greater. <HI>At Phaeton, Rutilos flamma populante capil∣los,

been any such Comet as in its Course might come so near the Earth as to set
the superficial part on Fire, and to kindle or excite the Subterraneous, Sul∣phureous

into a great Body in the upper Regions of the Air, and being kindled
might seem to pass near those Constellations, through which <HI>Phaeton</HI> is said
to be hurried and to come so near the Mediterranean parts as to burn the su∣perficial
Parts, and to inkindle the Subterraneous Mines of combustible and
inflammable Substances; or whether it were some prodigious quantity of in∣flammable
Steams collected in the Air, and so burnt off by continual Light∣ning,
it is hard positively to determine, because that part of the Story I
conceive to be Hypothetical, and Conjectural, or Philosophical, and not
meerly Historical. But the Effects produced, those I conceive to be Histori∣cal;
that is, that there were divers parts, which were before covered by
the Sea, that by this Eruption, were raised from under it and left dry. <HI>Tum
facta est Libye, raptis humoribus aestu arida: Tum Nymphae passis fontes{que} lacus{que} De∣flevere
comis. 237, 238. Et Mare contrahitur, Siccae{que} est campus arenae quod
modo pontus erat.</HI> 262 263. Then also were raised from under the Sea both
Islands and Mountains. <HI>Quos{que} altum texerat aequor Existunt montes, &amp;
Sparsas Cycladas augent.</HI> 263, 264. Then also did other parts sink under the
Water. <HI>Ipsum quo{que} Nerea fama est, Dorida{que} &amp; Natas, tepedis latuisse sub un∣dis.</HI>
Other parts were overflowed by the Sea and again deserted. <HI>Ter Nep∣tunus
aquis cum torvo brachia Vultu, Exerere ausus erat, ter non tulit aeris ignes.</HI>
272. Then were also caused great Earthquakes, and overturning and
tumblings of the Earth. <HI>Alma tamen Tellus, ut eras circumdata ponto, inter a∣quas
Pelagi, contractos{que} undi{que} fontes, Qui se condiderant in opacae viscera Matris,
Sustulit Omniferos Collo tenus arida Vultus: Opposuit{que} manum fronti,</HI> Magno{que}
tremore omnia Concutiens <HI>paulum Subsedit; &amp; infra, quam Solet esse fuit.</HI> Then
also was the Air filled with Fumes and Smokes, and the Surface of the Earth
covered with Ashes and Cinders. 231, 232. <HI>Et neque jam Cineres ejectam{que} fa∣villam
ferre potest, calido involvu ur undi{que} fumo.</HI> And again, 283, 284, speak∣ing
of the Earth, (<HI>Presserat ora vapor) tostos en aspice crines, in{que} oculis fumum;
volitant Super ora favillae.</HI> The superficial parts of the Earth, Vegetable and
Animal, were destroyed. 210, &amp;c. Corripitur flammis quae{que} a tissimatellus, fissa{que}
agit Rimas, &amp; Succis aret ademptis, pabula canescunt; tum frondibus uritur arbor,
Materiam{que} Suopraebet Seges arida Damno: Flumineae volucres medio caluere Caystro.
The earth was rent and cleft, and all the high Hills on Fire like <HI>Aetna or Ve∣suvius:</HI>
Those I named the last day. By this means many Rivers were swallowed
up into the Earth; others dried up by evaporation and boyling Heat. <HI>Mediis
Tanais fumavit in undis.</HI> 243, &amp;c. <HI>Nili Ostia septem Pulverulenta vacant, Septem
sine flumine Valles.</HI> And, to be short, all the effects that have ever been ob∣served
in Earthquakes, are here eminently expressed. So that there can be
no manner of doubt of the design of the Story, <HI>viz.</HI> That it was designed to
denote or describe a Catastrophy of the Mediterranean parts of the Earth
by Earthquakes; since all things are so properly delineated and represented
for that end, as if the Poet or Maker thereof had been spectator or Eye∣witness
of it, or at least a Contemporary with it. And we may here find the
whole Progress or Phaenomena of an Earthquake from its very first beginning
to its very last end, and the effects also that precede it, and those that are
subsequent to it, as I could plainly shew if it were not too much for this pre∣sent
Discourse, by explaining the Mythologick Histories immediately prefixt
and following it. Nay, there has not been in this late Earthquake in <HI>Sicily</HI>
<PB N="394" REF="373"/>
which seems to be the greatest mentioned in History) any one Phaenomenon
which cannot be shewn in this of <HI>Phaeton,</HI> and indeed most of the Phaenome∣na
mentioned in this of <HI>Phaeton</HI> have been exhibited or exemplified in this
last of <HI>Sicily;</HI> which I could easily manifest by comparing <HI>Ovid</HI>'s Description
with that of the <HI>Italian</HI> Frier; but I shall pass it by for the present.</P>
<P>I have,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part of another Lecture to the same purpose.</NOTE> in some of my former Discourses, indeavoured to shew some Pro∣babilities,
that the Mythologick Stories of the Poets did couch under those
monstrous and seemingly impossible representations of Actions performed by
humane Powers, some real and actual Catastrophies that had been caused by
the Body or Face of the Earth by other Natural Powers, of which the <HI>Ae∣gyptians,
Chaldeans, Greeks,</HI> or some other learned Nations had preserved
some Histories or Traditions among the more learned part of them; which,
that they might the better conceale their Knowledge, and keep it to them∣selves,
and abscond it from the Vulgar, and such as were not initiated and
admitted into their Fraternities, they had contrived and digested into fabu∣lous
Stories, which, as they might serve to amuse and awe the Vulgar by the
Daemonology they had thereupon superstructed, so they might serve to in∣struct
and inform the Adepti, or such as were admitted to the true interpre∣tation
and understanding of what they knew, of the real History that was
concealed thereby, as also of their Philosophical or Physical Hypothesis for
the Explication and Solution thereof. I think it cannot be doubted that the
Theogonia of <HI>Hesiod</HI> was of this nature, which if it was <HI>Hesiod</HI>'s (of which,
yet I confess their are some Moderns make a doubt) it seems to have been
some of the first Notions which the <HI>Greeks</HI> had obtained of these Matters
from the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> or <HI>Phaenicians,</HI> or some other of the Eastern Nations; except
we suppose that <HI>Orpheus,</HI> who preceded both <HI>Hesiod</HI> and <HI>Homer</HI> near five 100
Years, might in those times have known and communicated some what of
what they had by the same Methods procured. The Histories of those times
are very dark and uncertain, and nothing convincing can be built upon them.
It will be therefore but, lost Labour to indeavour to prove my Conjectures
from Histories, or hints to be sought among those few Fragments which are
now to be met withal among the Relicks of written Antiquities. Those, if such
there were, (as being committed to small and perishable Substances) have been
more easily drowned and swallowed by time, or buried and overwhelmed with
the Dust of Oblivion: And the Copy or Counterfeits of some of them, which
have been made by some of those we now call the Ancients (though with re∣spect
to them they are to be accounted Modern) seem to have been but very
imperfect, and to have been like Structures made up and peiced of the Rub∣bish,
Ruins and Fragments of those Antiquities which they in those times
could rake together; so that though some great Buildings have been by these
secundary Ancients erected; yet being made up of such Fragments or Parts
of those more ancient sacred Piles, by the new Disposition and Order of them they
now appear a preposterous <HI>Moles,</HI> yet we cannot but conceive that they had
some better and more certain informations of those more ancient Histories or
Traditions than what we now can find; and we cannot think so mean of them
as not to believe they did in some measure comprehend the Intention, Mean∣ing,
and Drift, or Design of those that preceded them; and tho' they want∣ed
a compleat knowledge, yet from the knowledge they had of the then
Ruins, they were better inabled to Judge and Conjecture concerning them,
than we now can. And tho' their Conjectures might not be all right, yet we
cannot but think they might be tollerably near the matter, and that they did
acquaint Posterity by their Writings what those their Conjectures were. And
of this Nature I take the Metamorphosis of <HI>Ovid</HI> to be, who, I conceive, had
made it his study to inform himself as fully as he was able of what was then
to be found concerning that knowledge, and out of those informations he
compiled that Book which was to comprise all the Records of Antiquity con∣cerning
the Changes and Catastrophies that had happened to the Earth from
the Creation unto his own time, which his four first prefactory Verses do plain∣ly
enough declare. <HI>In Nova fert animus mut at as dicere formas, Corporae dii caeptis
nam vos mutasti &amp; illas, Aspirate meis, Prima{que} ab Origine mundi, In mea per∣petuum
deducite tempora Carmen.</HI> Which is as much as to say, my design in
<PB N="395" REF="374"/>
this Book is to speak concerning the various alterations and transformations
which the Bodies or superficial Parts of the Earth have, by the Divine Powers,
undergone; for to those he doth ascribe them, <HI>Nam vos mutastis &amp; illas,</HI> and
therein to comprize all the knowledge I have been able to procure from the very first Creation or Original of it, even to these very times in which I
live. And accordingly we find him to begin this his History, even with the
beginning of the Creation of the Earth itself, and therein to have followed
the Traditions, Opinions, and Doctrines of the most Ancient Sages con∣cerning
its manner of Formation out of a preceeding Chaos; which Do∣ctrine
that it was very ancient, and indeed the most ancient of all others con∣cerning
the Origination of it, I think the Learned and Ingenious Dr. <HI>Bur∣net</HI>
in his <HI>Archaeologia</HI> has sufficiently proved, and therefore I shall not need to
say any thing concerning it; only I would make this one occasional Remark.
That how ancient soever it was, it did not savour of an unlearned or igno∣rant
Age or of a first beginning of real Knowledge, for that we find by <HI>Ovid</HI>'s
Copy of it, that it contained a more refined Conception concerning the Fi∣gure,
and Shape, and Properties of the Earth, than many of the Greek Phi∣losophers
(who in probability were many hundreds of Years after those first
Sages) had concerning it. Some of those Greek Philosophers making the
Earth to be of the form of a Drum or Cylinder, others of an infinite Column,
others of a Skiff or Boat, or of a floating Island in the midst of an infinite∣ly
extended plain Ocean, and others of other extravagant Shapes; whereas
we find that the Doctrine of the Chaos made it to be of a Sphaerical Form,
<HI>Solidumq; coercuit orbem,</HI> to consist of Land and Water, to have a proper
Gravity that kept all its parts in that shape, or his <HI>Tellus (Elementa{que} grandia
traxit &amp; pressa estgravitate sua</HI>) to be Involved with the Air, and that again
with the Aether. <HI>Haec Super imposuit liquidum &amp; gravitate carentem Aethera nec
quicquam terraenae foecis habentem,</HI> to be suspended in the Air, or Aether, or
space of Heaven without being supported by any imaginary Foundation, as
those Greeks fancied. <HI>Circumfuso pendebat in aere tellus, Ponderibus librata suis.</HI>
Nay, and by several other Passages and Expressions of this Book, it is clear,
that in those very ancient times, whenever they were, for 'tis hard certainly
to limit them; the Learned Men that then lived, had arrived to a very great
height of Natural Knowledge, especially of that part which concerned the
Cosmography or Constitution of the Universe; and by that Expression, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g∣nea
convexi vis &amp; sine pondere Caeli emicuit, summa{que} Locum sibi legit in Arce.</HI> It
seems plain that they placed the Sun in the Center of the universe, and made
the Earth to move about it. <HI>Principio terram, ne non aequalis ab omni Parteforet,
magni Speciem glomeravit in orbis.</HI> But this only by the bye; for I know the
common interpretation of these places, is altogether differing from what I
now give, yet were it now my business, I think I can shew susficient Reasons
to persuade any unprejudiced Person that what I have given is the designed
meaning of them; but I proceed to shew the general design of <HI>Ovid</HI> in this
Book. After the Description of the formation of the Earth, he comes to
describe the first times of its continuance; that is, the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or unknown
Ages of the World, of which he makes four, the Golden, Silver, Brazen
and Iron, in the last of which comes in the Mythologick and Historick, for
that he himself hath Mythologized also some of the Historical Times and
Events. What space of Time he allows to each of these Ages it doth not so
readily appear, but it is certain that the <HI>Chaldeans, Aegyptians, Brachmans,</HI> and
some Heathen Historians have assigned spaces large enough and even beyond
belief almost; and Mr. <HI>Graves</HI> tells us, that the Chinese do make the World
88640000 Years old. He begins the Mythologick Times with the Gygantomachia,
which to me seems to be nothing else but a Description of some prodigious
Earthquakes or Eruptions. And that by the Giants he plainly means noth∣ing
else but the Subterraneous Fires or Accensions which break out, and
throwing up before them the Earth, seemed to threaten the very Heavens
by piling Mountain upon Mountain (<HI>Affectasse ferunt Regnum Caeleste Gygantes Alta{que} congestos Struxisse ad Sidera montes</HI>) I shewed before in the interpreta∣tion
of the Rape of <HI>Proserpine,</HI> where it plainly appears what was meant by
<HI>Typheus</HI> one of those Giants, who is said to lie buried under the Island of <HI>Si∣cily,</HI>
<PB N="396" REF="375"/>
and therefore shall not need to say more upon that Subject. After the
breaking forth of these Subterraneous Streams and Flames, we find <HI>Ovid</HI>
describing them to be burnt off with Lightning. <HI>Tum Pater omnipotens misso
perfregit Olympum Fulmine &amp; excussit Subjectam Pelion Ossa. Obruta mole Sua
cum corpora dira jacerent, perfusam multo Natorum Sanguine terram immaduisse
ferunt, Calidum{que} animasse cruorem.</HI> This we find to be a general Concomitant
or Subsequent of such Eruptions, and it were easy to produce many Examples
of it in our late Eruptions; and 'tis also as usual for many of those places
that have been thrown or raised up into Hills to be sunk or tumbled down a∣gain,
<HI>Excussit subjectam Pelion Ossa.</HI> So we are told of a Hill that lately rose
up by <HI>Catanea,</HI> which soon sunk again. [<HI>Obruta</HI>] by this, I think, is plainly
signified the Eruption of fiery Streams or Rivers of melted Minerals out
of those Orifices or fiery Vents, such as in the two last Earthquakes in <HI>Sicily</HI>
have broke out of <HI>Aetna,</HI> and overflowed and burnt up and destroyed several
Towns, Villages, Fields, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for what can better express the moving, ra∣ging
and devouring Qualities of such a stream of Liquid Fire, than to call it
an animated, or living scalding Gore from its red and fiery Colour, its
scalding and burning Heat, its fluidity and rapid Motion, and its devouring
and consuming Power; but it would be too tedious to insist on all the remarkable
Circumstances and Expressions, which, I conceive, makes it plainly enough
appear what was the Design and Scope of the Story; nor need I mention
the Description of it by other Mythologers, as <HI>Claudian, Hygynus, Antoninus,
Liberalis.</HI> Nor will it, I hope, be needful to answer any thing to those who
would interpret it another way: Some making it to be only a Description of a
Rebellion; others a disguising of the History of the Tower <HI>Babylon.</HI> I shall rather
leave it to the Judgment of every one to make choice of which interpreta∣tion
he shall, upon duly considering the relation, think to be most aggree∣able
to the whole drift of the Book. And what I now deliver I would not
have to be taken otherwise than only as my Reasonings and Conjectures up∣on
the like Considerations: For as I observed before, the Poet has so couched
all his Relations and Expressions as to comprize a Physical, a Moral, and an
Historical Meaning in them. And it may be so interpreted as if it were de∣signed
to describe some particular Earthquakes, or some particular Rebellion,
or the general Rebellion of wicked Men against Heaven, and the Divine
Powers, or the attempt ot those at <HI>Babel,</HI> and at the same time it may also
be found designedly to contain in brief the Theory or Opinions of the most
antient Physiologers which they held concerning the Causes and Effects of
Earthquakes upon the uper Face of the Earth; which to me, I confess, seems
to be the principal aim and design or this Story of <HI>Ovid,</HI> as well as of the
most part of the rest of the Book, which I design, God willing, to prove
more expresly and particularly in a Treatise upon this Subject, so soon as I
have settled some Affairs, which have hitherto hindred me from perfecting
that and many other Subjects.</P>
<P>I shall not need here to say any thing concerning the Custom of the <HI>Greeks</HI>
in those former Ages of turning all their Histories into Mythologick Poetry;
'tis plainly enough proved by that Relation I read the last day out of <HI>Plato's
Timaeus;</HI> and it was not only used by them but by divers others Nations, as
the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Germans,</HI> as you will know. I suppose the reason was for the
better fixing it into the Minds of the Youth by a kind of indelible Character,
as <HI>Plato</HI> expresses it: Which could not be forgotten; for extravagant Marks
we know are the great helps of Artificial Memory, for that they raise extra∣ordinary
Attention; and that extraordinary Attention and Wonder does stig∣matise
or burn in as twere indelible Ideas in the Memory. Pleasure also is
another help to fix Ideas, and that Poetry and Songs contribute to, and the
activity of the Spirits in Youth work the Effects more powerfully, and
make them more durable. These I imagine were the Reasons why the <HI>Aegyptians,
Greeks</HI> and other Nations converted their true Histories into these Roman∣tick
Fables: Not that I do here undertake for the truth of History in every
Fable, for I conceive that there are as various kinds of Fables as there are of
Histories. Some are repeated and believed Fables which are true Histories,
others are believed true, but are really Fables: Some are believed Fables
<PB N="397" REF="376"/>
and are really so, and others are believed true and really are so. But of this
fourth Head I fear is the smallest number; but we must take the best Evi∣dence
we can to confirm our Belief of those that are generally so reputed: A∣mong
which none has been more looked after of late than Medalls, Inscrip∣tions,
and real Monuments, yet remaining of the preceding Persons and
Actions, these are by all looked upon as a most undeniable Proof to confirm a
written History, and yet we know that many things of this kind have been
counterfeited, yet that cannot be said of all: Now, if these that may be
counterfeited be yet looked upon as more Authentick than Written History,
then certainly these Medals, Inscriptions, or Monuments of Natures own
stamping, (which I alledged to prove an Hypothesis) which 'tis impossible for
Art to counterfeit, might in reason be looked upon as Proof sufficient tho'
no History could be produced. If I saw a perfect Medal, tho' I could not be
assertained whether it were Antique or Counterfeit, yet I could certainly
conclude it had been made by Art from the sensible Characteristicks of it;
now it seems very strange to me that so many evident Characteristicks as may
be plainly discovered in those figured Bodies should not force an assent; but
truth will in time prevail; but to give as much satisfaction as I can to all
Doubts, I will pitch upon one or two of the Fables of the Metamorphosis
for instances, to shew that they were designed to convey a certain History ve∣ry
much differing from the first appearance of the Fable. I will begin with
those of <HI>Perseus, Atlas, Andromeda</HI> and <HI>Medusa,</HI> because, as I conceive, they
have relation to the <HI>Herculean Columns,</HI> and to the <HI>Atlantis,</HI> or those parts
of <HI>Libya</HI> which were near it; they are somewhat long, however I must beg
your Patience to explain them a little more fully, and I will be shorter in the
rest.</P>
<P><HI>Perseus</HI> from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>circumferveo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of</HI> Perseus.</NOTE> I take to signifie hot inflamed Air or
Lightning which is the Earthy Exhalations set on fire by the Air dissolving
them; he is said to be the Son of<HI>Jove,</HI> that is of Aetherial or Elementary Fire
begotten in a shower of Gold or Fire from Heaven, that is Lightning. He
carries with him the <HI>Gorgons</HI> Head haired With Vipers, the Picture of Lightn∣ing.</P>

out sometimes: 'Tis represented as held in the Hand of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> some∣times
in the Mouth, sometimes in the Claws of his Eagle, and we shall find
afterwards in the Fable, that the Actions of <HI>Perseus</HI> against the Sea Monster

I conceive this alludes to the Snake-Stones, or Thunder-bolt-stones, as well
as the living Serpents; for the virtue of the <HI>Gorgon</HI>'s Head, which is Sub∣terraneous
Eructations or Damps, was the petrifying Quality converting all

receive the greatest part of the Sap from the Air and little from the Earth:
And they distribute more moisture to the Earth from their Bodies by their
descending Sap than they draw from it by their Vessels, and as the Sea Re∣turns
the Water it receives out of the Rivers into the Air, whence it circu∣lates
again into the Fountains and Rivulets by condensation and Rain, so
doth the process of Nature also operate in the manner of returning the moi∣sture

<P>The fiery Vapours flies over several Countries till it comes to the Country
of the <HI>Aethiopians,</HI> and the Plains of <HI>Cepheus</HI> or the <HI>Drones.</HI> Here he finds
<HI>Andromeda</HI> chained to a Rock expecting to be devoured by a Sea Monster.
<HI>Andromeda</HI>'s Name and Description agrees with that of an half drowned and
Rocky Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Fable of</HI> Andromeda</NOTE> by turns overflowed with the Sea at High Water and cover∣ed
with Sand (<HI>Jusserat Ammon</HI>) and seems to be that part of <HI>Africa</HI> where
<HI>Jupiter Ammon</HI>'s Temple was built; which since raised, is all Sandy, and therefore
is called <HI>Ammon</HI> or Sandy. <HI>Perseus,</HI> its said would have thought her Marble, but
that he saw the waving of her Hair by the Wind, which may signifie that
some Reeds, or such Water-plants, might grow among the Sand and Rocks
sometimes overflowed by the Sea. Here (to make it short) <HI>Perseus,</HI> or the
fiery Eruption, raiseth the frontier Parts to the Sea, and repelleth the Tide of
Flood from overflowing and drowning the Land. And so <HI>Andromeda</HI> becomes
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, raised and freed from the Inundation; this is so very plainly spe∣cified
in the Description, that bating a little poetical Expression about Love;
which <HI>Ovid</HI> had well studied, having a gust for it. It seems plainly to design
the History of such a Metamorphosis, and very probably of that very Coun∣try
I before mentioned; and were it worth while, I am apt to believe, that
the Histories designed by all the other Fables may be discovered; for that
they have all such Histories couched under them, I do no ways doubt; not on∣ly
for the Arguments I at first mentioned, but for several others. Moreover
I do conceive, that there is a Chronologoe of the preceding times to be dis∣covered
out of them, and that they are written, not fortuitously, but with
great Care, and according to the due Order in which they happened. And
tho' possibly this do not at first view so plainly appear, nor can be so unde∣niably
demonstrated without a more perfect knowledge of the <HI>Hieroglyphick</HI>
and <HI>Mythologick</HI> Characters; yet I am almost certain that some such Chrono∣gick
Account is couched in the Fable, and may, if well examined, be detect∣ed;
and to conclude, I am apt to believe, that in this Mythology is contain∣ed
the greatest part of the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> and <HI>Grecian</HI> History of the preceding
Ages of the World; the truth of which I do not undertake to defend, we
must take that as we do all other Histories, upon trust till we can have better
<PB N="402" REF="381"/>
Proof either for or against them. And if these be so admitted, this Book will
furnish a sufficient number of such Catastrophies that have happened in for∣mer
Ages to make the Hypothesis, I have indeavoured to explain, to seem
at least probable, if not necessary, and neither so absurd or impossible as some
have asserted.</P>
<P>Read <HI>March</HI> 8, 169<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>3</SUB>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fable of the Rape of <HI>Proserpina.</HI></NOTE> I have some Years since propounded in this place my
Conjectures for the explication of the Mythology delivered by <HI>Ovid</HI> in his
<HI>Metamorphosis,</HI> namely, That he thereby designed to comprise a History of
the changes which had happened to the World from the beginning thereof
to the times wherein he lived, which he signfies Aenigmatically by the first
four Verses. The method of which is by personating Things and Powers:
The one by Mortals, namely, material Things, the other by Immortals,
namely, Powers, or Energies and comprising therein a three fold <HI>Cabala</HI> or
Tradition, namely, A <HI>Physical,</HI> comprehending the Causes, Effects and Rea∣sons;
an <HI>Historical,</HI> comprehending the Times, Ages, Persons and Places,
And a <HI>Moral,</HI> to make them Instructive and Useful for the Regiment, and<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
moralising the more vulgar part of Mankind. In which he has indeavour∣ed
to follow the method of the Greek Poets, who, as I have formerly exem∣plified
in <HI>Homer, Hesiod,</HI> and the rest of the Mythologers, did prosecute
the same design. By the interpretation of which Mythology, if we could
discover and find out the true Key, I conceive it would open and make ma∣nifest
much of the History of the Catastrophics that have happened in the
World, and of the places and Ages wherein they were produced.</P>
<P>That which makes me repeat this Notion at this time, is the dreadful Ef∣fects
of the late Earthquake in <HI>Sicily,</HI> which put me in mind of what I had
here formerly instanced, on the Story as it is delivered by <HI>Ovid</HI> in his fifth
Book concerning the Rape of <HI>Proserpina</HI> by <HI>Pluto,</HI> which I then conceived, and
am still of the same Opinion (however others were of a contrary) was designed
by the Poet to represent some dreadful Earthquake that had formerly
happened in <HI>Sicily</HI> not far, nor much differing from the Place and Effects of
this late dreadful Catastrophy: Save only that we do not yet hear of the
swallowing up, or the sinking down into or under the Water of any consi∣derable
Country or Town, which I conceive is plainly specified by the Poet
to have been effected by that which he designs to delineate: For <HI>Proserpina</HI> or
<HI>Abrepta,</HI> as the Name signifies is plainly described to have been seated in
that place of the Island where the Lake <HI>Pergusa</HI> was in <HI>Ovid</HI>'s Time, and
where it remains, I suppose, to this Day: It is deseribed to be the Daughter
or Off-spring of <HI>Ceres,</HI> that is, a City or Place flourishing in a much civilised
and well cultivated Country; for that <HI>Ceres</HI> doth plainly denote, and is so
signified by the Poet.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>Prima Ceres Vnco Glebam Dimovit aratro,</L>
<L>Prima dedit Fruges alimenta{que} mitia terris;</L>
<L>Prima dedit Leges: Cereris sunt Omnia Munus.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Ceres</HI> with crooked Plough Gleabes first did turn,</L>
<L>And first taught Men to feed on Fruits and Corn:</L>
<L>She first gave Laws <HI>Ceres</HI> did all adorn.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>This Place or Country was also very pleasant and flourishing with Fruits, Flow∣ers
Fountains, especially Woods, in which <HI>Proserpina</HI> is said to be disporting and
innocently gathering Flowers, when <HI>Pluto</HI> suddainly seised her and carried her
into the Earth; that is, whatever the place were, whether Town, Village or City
before the Rape, it seems to have the same fate with St. <HI>Euphaemia</HI> mentioned
by <HI>Kircher</HI> in his <HI>Mundus Subterraneus;</HI> that is, to have been by an Earth∣quake
swallowed up into the Earth, and to have sunk so low, as to have left
a Bason for a Lake for after Ages, to this Day. Now, that this is plainly
the Physical meaning of the Poet will appear plain if the whole Story be taken
in. First, The Poet tells you the place to be <HI>Trinacria</HI> or <HI>Sicily.</HI> This Country,
the' most Delicious, Pleasant, rich in Soil, well Cultivated and Tilled, and
<PB N="403" REF="382"/>
very much Civilised and Governed by good Laws, as is figured by <HI>Ceres,</HI> as
I have mentioned, was yet feated on a Sulphureous, and Fiery, Cavernous
Foundation, subject to Heavings, Tremblings and Earthquakes, expressed
by the Giant <HI>Typhaeus,</HI> who had endeavour'd to invade Heaven, that is, to
belch up Flames, and throw Stones and Rocks against it, but at length came
to be covered with this Island. Verse 346, to 356. Hereupon <HI>Dis</HI> or <HI>Pluto,</HI>
that is, the Spirit of the Earth is fained by the Poet to be roused up to see
least the Vault of the Earth over his place or Residence, should be broken by
the fury of the Giant <HI>Typhaeus;</HI> that is, by the working of the Sulphureous
Vapours and Fulminations, Ver. 356—<HI>Et Rex pavet ipse silentum,</HI> Ver. 362.
That is, the Earth rose and swelled, and there were Eruptions of Smoke
signified by the Black Horses his Chariot was drawn by, and there was a ge∣neral
Earthquake over all the Island, but the great Eruption was at the place
where the Lake <HI>Pargusa</HI> is. Here the Poet fains that <HI>Pluto,</HI> or the Subter∣raneous
Powers were in Love with the Beauty of this Goodly Place personated
by <HI>Proserpina. Venus,</HI> or Youthful Beauty or Thoughts doth excite <HI>Cupid</HI> or
Love and Desire in this Terrestrial or Subterraneal Power to take away this
pleasant Place, <HI>Proserpina</HI> from its curious Situation, and swallow it up, or
hurry it away on a sudden into his own, or the Subterraneous Regions. Ver.
363, to 385. All Poetical to express how <HI>Dis</HI> was thus enamored of <HI>Proserpina,</HI>
from 385, to 395. The pleasant Situation of <HI>Proserpina</HI> is described▪ from
395, to 408. The Catastophy is described, which manifests, that this terrible
Earthquake extended from the place where the Lake <HI>Pergusa</HI> now is to the
Place where the City of <HI>Syracuse</HI> stood, now called <HI>Saragosa,</HI> where the River
<HI>Anapis</HI> runs into the Sea: By this the Lake <HI>Anapis</HI> was broken, open and made a
Bay to the Sea, and no remainder of <HI>Cyane,</HI> but some small Brooks that run
into that Bay. This I take to be the meaning of the Poet from 409, to the
end of 437. The remaining part of the Story seems to be a description of
the Devastations made in the Country, being made unfit for Tillage, and
therefore <HI>Ceres</HI> is said to seek her Daughter <HI>Proserpina</HI> all over the World, the
remaining Husbandman seeking for other places fit for Tillage, but returns to
<HI>Sicily,</HI> at Verse 463.</P>
<P>It would be too long to interpret all which I think I could easily do, and shew
plainly the meaning of the Physical <HI>Cabala.</HI> But I designed to mention this
only at present as an example pertinent to this present time, when we yet
have the noise of the <HI>Sicilian</HI> Earthquake, and some others, yet sounding in
our Ears: As to the Moral <HI>Cabala</HI> many have handled it; and for the Histo∣rical,
I shall take some other time to Discourse of it, and to give my Con∣jectures.</P>
<Q>A Lecture read. <HI>Feb.</HI> 15, 1687-88. confirming what the Author bad before said
as to Earthquakes and their Effects.</Q>
<P>I need not repeat what I have formerly said as to the several curiously fi∣gured
Stones found in many parts, nay, I may say, all parts of the Earth,
that they are really the several Bodies they represent, or the mouldings of
them Petrified, and not, as some have imagined, <HI>a Lusus Naturae</HI> sporting her
self in the needless formation of useless Beings.</P>
<P>I shall only add some Confirmations of the Conclusions I then deduced
from an <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> which I took the liberty to propose. And First,</P>
<P>As to the Sphaeriodical Figure of the Earth, and thence of the Decrease of
Gravity towards the Aequator instead of the Increase, as most of the followers
of <HI>Des Cartes,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hobbs,</HI> and divers others of the Modern Naturalists assert;
tho' it were at first much opposed, yet I find that it is now by divers not
thought so improbable but that it may be supposed; and tho' I find the con∣sequent
Supposition as yet opposed, yet I question not but in time to make
that appear to be necessary also; but every thing must have its time. As to
that also which I have Published, how unlikely soever it may appear, I hope
<PB N="404" REF="383"/>
also to be able to produce very good Arguments for it, and that it was not
an Hypothesis proposed at random, as some may imagine.</P>
<P>But because these in themselves, tho' fully proved, were not sufficient to
solve all the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Nature as to the Disposition of those figured Bo∣dies,
whether Shells or other Substances; therefore in the fourth place I laid
down as a Supposition, that the superficial Parts of the Earth had been very
much altered by <HI>Subterraneous Eruptions,</HI> whereby divers Parts that had before
such Eruptions or Earthquakes been under the Sea, had been raised out of it
and been made Islands; and that other parts that had been dry Land had been
sunk into and covered by the Sea; that Vallies had been turned to Cliffs, and
Hills to Vallies or Lakes, and the like.</P>
<P>This was likewise opposed and thought very improbable, because for so
long time as our History will reach backwards, it was affirmed there had hap∣pened
no such change; and therefore, because it was supposed no such Hi∣story
could be produced, this also was to be rejected, and we must again have
recourse to the <HI>Lusus Naturae</HI> as the only expedient to give satisfaction; only
some kind of Subterraneous Passages were thought of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Confirmation of the <HI>Atlantis.</HI></NOTE> by which Oysters and
other Fish might be conveyed to the middle of the <HI>Alps,</HI> going alongwith the
Stream of the Water from the Sea to supply the Springs and Fountains at
the top of the Hills.</P>
<P>I confess it seemed to me a little hard, because I could not give the Pedi∣gree
of the Fish, therefore I should not be allowed to believe it a Fish, when
I saw all the sensible marks of a Fish; and that, because I could not tell who
it was, or upon what occasion that caused the Stones on <HI>Salisbury</HI> Plain to be
dispersed in that irregular Regularity, that therefore I must allow them to
be a <HI>Lusus Naturae,</HI> or placed there by <HI>Merlin</HI> or, some such unknown way,
and not by the Hands, Labour or Workmanship some such Men as are now
living. Nevertheless that I might, as far as I was able, satisfy these Objections
also, I produced the History of <HI>Plato</HI> as brought out of <HI>Aegypt</HI> by <HI>Solon,</HI> con∣cerning
the Island of the <HI>Atlantis.</HI> But this tho' related by <HI>Plato,</HI> with all the
Circumstances, as if he believed it a true History, was yet supposed to be on∣ly
a Fiction of <HI>Plato</HI> to lay the Scene of his Common-wealth, or at best a Fable
of the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Priest to magnify the knowledge of the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> as to the
History of preceding Ages. I confess the account of the nine thousand Years
is Argument enough to make the whole History to be suspected as a Fiction;
but yet till we are certain what space of Time is there signified by a Year it
will be a little hard to reject the whole for that Circumstance, since most of
the other Circumstances of it are more probable.</P>
<P>And that they were thought so by divers of the Ancients, is plain from se∣veral
Testimonies that might be alledged; I shall only mention what <HI>Strabo</HI>
says of it in his second Book, where examining whether <HI>Eratosthenes</HI> had duly
amended the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of the Antients headds, that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
&amp;c. <HI>Erato sthenes</HI> (says he) has done well in expounding the manner how the
Surface of the Earth may be changed, by relating how the same may sometimes
be raised, and sometimes be sunk by Earthquakes, and various otherways
changed, as we also have in many particulars Enumerated, by which also he hath
properly shown how the History, which <HI>Plato</HI> relates concerning the Island of
<HI>Atlantis,</HI> as it was brought out of <HI>Aegypt</HI> from the Priests there, by <HI>Solon,</HI> may
be well believed not to be a Fiction, but a true History. From which Pas∣sage
it is plain, that both <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Eratosthenes</HI> did look upon this History
of <HI>Plato,</HI> or rather of the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> as very probable; <HI>Pliny</HI> also was of the
like Opinion, as appears, not only by his mentioning the History of <HI>Plato,</HI> but
by the several other Mutations, which he relates to have been made by the
means of Earthquakes.</P>
<P>But because the Scene of this Tragedy of <HI>Atlantis</HI> was placed very far back∣wards
in times remote, and that we have no other History of this change but
what <HI>Plato</HI> is pleased to relate, I did therefore indeavour to produce some
History concerning the changes that had happened since that time, namely,
within the reach of the Greek Histories, in the sameplace where this <HI>Atlantis</HI>
<PB N="405" REF="384"/>
was said to be sunk down into the Sea. For this I produced the History of
the <HI>Periplus</HI> of <HI>Hanno,</HI> the <HI>Carthaginian,</HI> as it is set forth by <HI>Berkelius;</HI> from
which I collected that at the time when this Expedition was made, the place
where the <HI>Atlantis</HI> was said to be sunk, was found to be partly Sea and part∣ly
Islands, and that the same extended, as I conceive, as far to the West∣wards
almost as the <HI>Madera</HI> Island, about which place was then found a small
Island called <HI>Cerne;</HI> from which Coasting Southwards for twelve Days, they
found the Land all on Fire, and one prodigious high Mountain flaming out at
the top, called <HI>Theon Ochema,</HI> or the Chariot of the Gods; which, by all Cir∣cumstances,
I conceived to be the same with the now Pike of <HI>Teneriff.</HI> Sup∣posing
which Relation true, I deduced thence that there must needs have hap∣pened
great changes in those Parts between the time of this Expedition and
the present; for that all those places which seem to be described by that Hi∣story
are not now to be found in the places where they are by that Relation
placed. But this Relation was also looked upon as fabulous, because I pro∣duced
no other Authority for it besides the Relation itself and the Testimony
of <HI>Pliny.</HI> But those who are better read in Ancient History, may find that it
was by most of the Ancients supposed real; and all agree that the <HI>Phaenicians,</HI>
of whom the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> were a Colony, were very skillful in Astronomy, Na∣vigation,
Arithmetick and Traffick, and that they were the first introducers
of these among the Greeks, together with the Knowledge and Use of Let∣ters.
And from those Particulars I noted in the said Relation, it seems to
me very evident, that they understood what Longitude and Latitude was,
and knew how to keep account of their Course and Distance; and tho' the
Interpretation thereof which I produced, be differing from all the other I
have yet known: Some supposing it to relate wholly to the Coast of <HI>Africa</HI> as
it is shaped, at present, and others in other Situations, yet whoever
(taking this Notion of their skill in Astronomy and Navigation along with
them) shall strictly examine the Relation itself, he will, I conceive, be per∣suaded
to be somewhat of my Mind. <HI>Strabo</HI> therefore says of them. <HI>The</HI>
Sidonians <HI>were reported to be good Artists in various things, as it is also manifest by
their Actions; as also,</HI> and <HI>Philosophers, Astronemers and Arithmeticians, and
such as well knew the se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ret of Numbers and of S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iling in the Night also.</HI> From
which considenration I conceive, that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in the Relation can signify no∣thing
else but the same Paralled of Latitude, or the same straight Line with
that from <HI>Carthage</HI> to the Mouth of the <HI>Streights.</HI></P>
<P>I was not then able to quote the place in <HI>Aristotle</HI> which relates to this dis∣covery
of the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> tho' I was well assured I had met with such a Re∣lation;
'Tis in his Book, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in these Words,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c.“ In the Sea that lies without the Pillars of
<HI>Hercules,</HI> they say, that, by the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> there has been discovered an
Island deserted, but abounding with variety of Woods, and rich Rivers fit
for Navigation, abounding also with variety of Fruits, distant from the
Continent several Days Sail.” <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> also mentions the extream <HI>At∣lantick</HI>
to be inhabited by a wild sort of People, which he calls <HI>Aegypanes,
Blemmeae</HI> and <HI>Gamphalentes,</HI> and a kind of <HI>Satyrs.</HI> And in his Third Book and tenth Chapter, he says, <HI>Vltra hunc sinum m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns altus ut Graec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vocant <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
vehiculum Deorum perpetuis ignibus flagrat,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> also mentions
some such Island in his Fifth Book <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c.
That is, “Against <HI>Libya</HI> there is situated an Island in the Ocean, considerable
for Magnitude, several Days Sail distant towards the West, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>” I could
cite several other Authors who mention some such Place, which may have
relation to the discoveries of the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> in <HI>Hanno</HI>'s Expedition; all
which do plainly make it appear, that his discoveries were towards the West,
and not towards the South; and therefore it seems very probable, that at
that time there were Islands both greater and smaller to the Westwards of the
Streights Mouth, which are not now to be found, and consequently they must
have suffered a Submersion by some intervening Catastrophies, which was the
thing Iindeavoured to deduce from it. Nor will it seem so unlikely if we will
<PB N="406" REF="385"/>
but consider the alterations by Eruptions out of the Sea near the Islands of
the <HI>Canarys,</HI> and in one of the Islands also within these few Years; the for∣mer
was the Eruption out of the Sea, in the Year 1639, which <HI>Athanatius
Kircher</HI> has given a description of, and I have received a relation of it by
Word of Mouth from two Persons who were both upon the <HI>Tenariff</HI> Island at
the same time, and had each of them often observed it tho' at a considerable
distance: The latter Eruption happened within a few Years since in one of the
same Islands, of which I have Printed the Relation in one of my Collections.</P>
<P>And thus, I hope, I have given some ground to believe that the Antient
Historians knew and gave some Credit also to both these Relations, namely,
that of <HI>Solon</HI> and that of <HI>Hanno,</HI> which, by that Passage of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> appears
to have been made either before or in his time.</P>
<P>I came in the next place to shew that the <HI>Metamorphosis</HI> of <HI>Ovid</HI> contained
many Histories of great Changes and Catastrophies that had happened long
before his time to the parts of the Earth; which, tho' rapped up in Mytho∣logy
and Mascarade, yet those disguises being removed, it will not, I con∣ceive,
be very difficult to make appear what the true Histories are, which
now pass Incognito. To this purpose I did observe that <HI>Ovid</HI> has in some part
or other of his Fable, given Marks or Characteristicks by which it may be
found what the History is which he doth there Mythologize; this he doth
very often in that part which serves as a Link to join the Story into a con∣tinued
Chain▪ or in the Etymology of the Names, tho' often times also in the
process of the Poem. And 'tis usual with him all along to have and mix a
treble Design in each of them, namely, an Historical, a Physical, and a Mo∣ral;
and this he hath done with great Judgment and Subtilty of Invention
and upon several occasions, he makes Excursions into this or that Design
and prosecuting it for a time, as if he had no respect to the other two; but
yet, if well examined, it will be found, I conceive, in most that he influenc∣eth,
even there also, that design by the other two. If I had leisure to pro∣secute
this Speculation, I conceive I could trace most of these his Designs but
it would be too long a Work; however, I hope in a short time to be able to
give several Instances and Examples out of those I have more attentively ex∣amined,
which may suffice to shew that there is a probability in this Con∣jecture
how differing soever it be from other Commentators.</P>
<P>But those perhaps may not be thought sufficient for the present Dispute to
satisfy such as demand positive and direct Histories, and undoubted Records
of such changes, as I have supposed necessary to make out the Hypothesis of
the figured Bodies, which are found to be real Shells, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to have been by
them disposed and situated in the places where they are now found: For such
therefore I shall prepare a Cloud of Witnesses, which, unless they will deny
all Histroy, will stand the Proof.</P>
<P>I confess I cannot see any Circumstance in the story of <HI>Hanno</HI> that should
render it suspected, since 'tis granted by all, that the <HI>Phaenicians,</HI> of whom the
<HI>Carthaginians</HI> were a Colony, were so early eminent in Arts, especially in that
of Navigation and Traffick; so that we find <HI>Solon</HI> made use of them; a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
that <HI>Sanchoniathon Beritius</HI> before the time of the <HI>Trojan</HI> War, did write the
Theology of the <HI>Phaenicians</HI> (as <HI>Porphyrius</HI> relates) in the <HI>Phaenician</HI> Language:
And that the Philosophy of the Greeks was derived principally from them;
as also Astronomy, and even the knowledge and use of Letters. For <HI>Thales</HI>
was a <HI>Phaenician,</HI> and <HI>Pherecides</HI> who was the Master of <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> and the
founder of the Italick Phylosophy, and co-equal with <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/></HI> learned it out
of the occult Books of the <HI>Phaenicians.</HI> And from <HI>Pythagoras</HI> his Philosophy
sprang and flowed both the <HI>Platonick</HI> Philosophy, and also the Philosophy of
his Scholar <HI>Aristotle,</HI> tho' somewhat altered by the Pipes it ran through. So
that tho' we have but very little of the Histroy of those Times, yet by those
few Fragments dispersed here and there, we may be sufficiently satisfied they
were able, and actually did make as great Voyages and Discoveries, as that
of <HI>Hanno;</HI> of which there are divers Relations mentioned by <HI>Herodotus</HI> in
his second Book.</P>
<P><PB N="407" REF="386"/>
But tho' (notwithstanding what I have alledged) all these Histories shall be
looked upon as Fictions and Romantick without any real Ground,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tho' History should fail Ex∣periments are Cogent.</NOTE> yet what
I have indeavoured to shew by Experiment and Inspection, and the deducti∣ons
made therefrom, will not be found destitute of good Authority, proved
from very eminent Authors both Antient and Modern, to make out the Truth
and Certainty thereof. As first to prove, that those Bodies were found at
the tops of Mountains, and that they were notwithstanding asserted to be
Shells; we have the Testimony of <HI>Herodotus</HI> in his <HI>Euterpe</HI> or second Book,
and twelveth Section,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proofs out of <HI>Herodotus.</HI></NOTE> where speaking of the Country of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> as having
been mostly raised by the Mud and Sand of the <HI>Nile,</HI> he says, the whole
Country was of such a Soil, only the Mountain above <HI>Memphis</HI> was Sandy,
and had <HI>Conchilia</HI> or Fishes Shells upon it, and abounded with Salt, so that it
corrupted the <HI>Pyramids.</HI> Which Passage is very pertinent to my present pur∣pose,
and is also fully confirmed by <HI>Aristotle;</HI> For it seems all the lower <HI>Ae∣gypt</HI>
was a Plain, which had rose by the settlement of Mud of the <HI>Nile,</HI> which
he says, in the space of nine hundred Years, had been raised eight Cubits, or
twelve Foot; for that eight Foot rise of the <HI>Nile,</HI> in the time of <HI>Myris,</HI> o∣verflowed
all <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and in his time there was necessary sixteen Cubits, or
twenty four Foot swelling to overflow it. So that he seems to understand,
that all the lower <HI>Aegypt</HI> had been at first Sea, and that the <HI>Nile,</HI> by degrees,
had filled it up to the height of the Plain, and so had covered all the bottom
or Sand of the Sea, only the Mountainous part above <HI>Memphis</HI> was above that
lével, and so that kept its old bottom or covering of Sand and Shells. This
seems to be the meaning of what he argues for; but yet I must needs say, that
does not solve all the Difficulty; for how comes this Mountain to be so much
higher than the Plain, as it was then raised by the <HI>Nile,</HI> and thence that
Plain to be much above the Sea that was thereby excluded, unless we do sup∣pose
also that some Subterraneous Power did raise that Mountain above the
level it was of when covered by the Sea, or that the Sea had sometimes been
so high as to cover that Mountain, which, tho' <HI>Herodotus</HI> takes no notice of,
yet <HI>Aristotle</HI> does fully solve it; but be it which way soever,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Pyramids</HI> are founded on a Rock</NOTE> 'tis Testimony
enough of the matter of Fact that <HI>Herodotus</HI> himself calleth them <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
and observed the exudation of the Salt. But this Place is also observable
for another Passage, and that is to confirm Conjectures I formerly acquainted
the Society with, concerning the <HI>Pyramids of Aegypt,</HI> namely, that I con∣ceived
them to be <HI>founded on and Ashler'd as it weere about a Core of Rock,</HI> and
by this Discourse it is plain, that the place where they stand is so qualified;
for by this Description 'tis plain, that it is described as Rocky, and covered
with Sea Sand; for that <HI>Herodotus</HI> takes notice it had both Sea-shells, and Salt
mixed with it; but this here only by the bye. Before I leave <HI>Herodotus</HI> his
Testimony, I cannot but take notice of another Passage in the same Book, in
the 74th and 75th Paragraphs; the translate runs thus, <HI>Circa Thebas sunt Sa∣cri
Serpentes Nihil omnino hominibus noxii, pusillo corpore, binis praediti cornibus e
summo vertice enatis, quos defunctos in Jovis Aede sepeliunt, huic enim Deo Sacros
illos esse praedicant;</HI> thus far is the story he is told by the <HI>Aegyptians, Est au∣tem
Arabia Locus ad Butum urbem fere positus ad quern Locum ego me cantuli quod
audirem volueres esse Serpentes. Eo cum perveni, Ossa Serpentum aspexi &amp; Spinas
multitudine Supra fidem ad Enarrandum quarum acervi erant magni, &amp; his alii at{que}
alii minores ingenti Numero. Est autem hic Locus ubi Spinae projectae Jacebant hu∣juscemodi,
ex Arctis montibus exporrigitur in vastam planitiem Aegyptiae Contiguaem.
Fertur ex Arabia Serpentes alatos, ineunte statim vere, in Aegyptum volare, sed eis
ad ingressum planities occurrentes aves Ibides, non permittere sed ipos interimere, &amp;
ob id opus Ibin magno in honore ab Aegyptiis haberi, Arabes aiunt.</HI></P>
<P>Part of this story is what he was told, part what he saw; he was, told of
flying Serpents, which the Bird <HI>Ibis</HI> met over that Valley, and so devoured
them leaving only the Back-bone. I have heard many stories told of our
Snake-stones or <HI>Cornua Ammonis,</HI> and I have seen some to confirm the story
with a very formal Head carved on them; I think not long-since here was one
shewed in this place; I am apt to think the Spines of the Serpents <HI>Herodotus</HI>
there found in such plenty and such variety of bignesses, were no other than
those <HI>Cornua Ammonis,</HI> and thence, I conceive, proceeded the superstitious
<PB N="408" REF="387" MS="y"/>
Custom when they found any of these Stones or Spinae they carried and buried
them in the Temple of <HI>Jupiter Ammon,</HI> and it seems to me a farther con∣firmation
of what I formerly hinted concerning the Stone adorned with Jewels,
and carried in processions by the Priests of that Temple, mentioned by <HI>Pliny</HI>
and several others. But to proceed, to this Testimony and Opinion of <HI>Hero∣dotus,</HI>
I shall add that of <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> as related by <HI>Ovid</HI> in his 15th Book of
the Metamorphosis, <HI>ver.</HI> 262, and so onwards. <HI>Vidiego quod fuerat quondam
Solidissima tell us, esse fretum. Vidi factas ex aequore terr as: Et procul a pelago conche
Jacuere Marinae. Et vetus inventa est in montibus anchora summis.</HI> From which
Testimonies 'tis plain that this Phaenomenon of Shells was taken notice of by
the Antient Historians and Philosophers: And I am apt to think that this
might, in some measure, spread among them, the Notion of general Deluges
that in preceding Ages had happened, as <HI>Pythagoras</HI> seems to hint in this
place, by supposing them to happen after a certain long Revolution of time;
and that <HI>Thales,</HI> and many others, supposed that the Principle, from which
all things sprung, was Water: And that the Passage in the Fragment of <HI>San∣choniathon,</HI>
where he speaks of the first Original of all things, says, That in
the <HI>Phaenician</HI> Language it was called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which possibly may be much of the
signification of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in the Hebrew, which signifies Motion; that is, Fluidi∣ty,
for so the interpretation of <HI>Sanchomathon</HI> seems to make it <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
Which some will have to be Mud, others the Corruptions of
watery mixtures (as if <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> were derived from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Mors</HI> Death or Cor∣ruption)
from which sprung the Seeds of all living Creatures, and the Gene∣ration
of all things. That the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> threw the History of the Flood so
far backwards, and made it so differing from the Chronology of the Bible, I
take it to be for no other Cause but to make the World believe they were pre∣ceding
to all others in Antiquity of History and Chronology: To which
purpose <HI>Herodotus</HI> tells a pleasant Relation of <HI>Psammiticus,</HI> that the Aegyp∣tians
before his time had vaunted themselves to be first People upon the
Face of the Earth, but he having a mind to be informed of this by Experi∣ment,
caused two Children to be bred up in a Desert Place by a Shepherd,
so that they should not hear any Language to all spoken, to the end to see
what Language they would naturally speak of themselves; from hence he
supposed they would speak the first and most Natural Language. This ha∣ving
been done, and the Children grown two Years old, the Shepherd o∣pening
the Door of the place where they were so kept and fed with Milk,
they both reached out their hands to him crying <HI>Beccos,</HI> which the Shep∣herd
taking notice of acquainted <HI>Psammiticus</HI> with, who inquiring what that
word might signify in any Language, was informed that <HI>Beccos</HI> signified Bread
in the <HI>Phrygian</HI> Language; from which time <HI>Herodotus</HI> says, the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> lost
their seniority, and granted the <HI>Phrygians</HI> to be the first and themselves the
second People for Antiquity. So that tho' their account of Years may be hence
supposed to be uncertain, yet their Learning and their lasting Monuments of
their former greatness, namely, the <HI>Pyramids, Obelisks, Colossi, Labyrinths,</HI> and
the like, shewed them to have been long before <HI>Herodotus</HI> his time very con∣siderable
for Arts and Literature. And that they had some Records of a
preceding Flood, I have before mentioned, whether the same with that of
<HI>Noah,</HI> Or some more particular Flood, which those of <HI>Deucalion</HI> and <HI>Ogygas</HI>
seem to have been, I leave to the learned Antiquaries to determine. I could
produce several other Testimonies to shew they had the notion of a Deluge.</P>
<P>But it seems to me very improbable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Flood.</NOTE> that these Shells should have been the
effect of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Flood by reason of its short duration; which was not long
enough of continuance to produce and perfect those Creatures in so short
a space to the bigness and perfection they seem to have had. It must there∣fore
have been either some particular Floods of a longer duration; or else
the places where they are found, must have been some times or other the bot∣tom
of the Sea, and afterwards raised by Subterraneous Motions, Swellings,
or Eruptions: Which, whither those just immediately preceded the end of
the general Deluge in the time of <HI>Noah,</HI> and that That part which before
the Flood was Land, did sink, and became covered by the Sea, and those
<PB N="409" REF="388"/>
parts which were before under the Sea, did, by degrees, towards the deter∣mination
of that Catastrophy, rise and swell up into Land, Hills and Moun∣tains,
I leave to the Learned to determine. Certain it is, that there were
some very great changes of the superficial Parts of the Earth at that time;
since it is said; that all the Fountains of the Deep, or Abysse, were broken
up; the Scripture renders <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
There seems by the Expression to be a twofold supply
of Water to cause this Flood, the one by the opening of the <HI>Stereoma</HI> or Fir∣mament
in the middle of the Waters, <HI>viz.</HI> that of the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
and of the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the gathering together of the Waters
above the former <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; but <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, these God called the
Sea, and the parts of the Earth that were uncovered thereby he called dry
Land. The <HI>Stereoma</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is assigned for the place of the Stars, Sun and
Moon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and has always the Epithet of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> joined with it.
<HI>Ovid</HI> likewise who seems to allude in some measure to this History of the Crea∣tion
delivered by <HI>Moses</HI> in the first Chapter of <HI>Genesis,</HI> says, <HI>Circumfluus hu∣mor
ultima possedit solidum{que} coercuit orbem.</HI> I think, were it proper to the
present Subject, I could give a very plausible account concerning the manner
of that Deluge, as it is expressed by <HI>Moses;</HI> tho' it differ from all that I have
yet met with, yet I can prove it warranted both by the Text and by genuine
Physical Principles: but it would be too long a digression for the present Sub∣ject,
and I shall shortly have a more proper opportunity to demonstrate the
inner Parts and Constitution of this Globe, my present Business being to
explicate the Phaenomena of the outward and superficial Parts, and to prove
that the Bodies, which I have asserted to be Shells, have been so reputed by
the Antient as well as the Modern Historians: Next to shew that they are,
or have been, found in most Parts of the World. And if those two be prov∣ed,
then will necessarily follow that there must have been some time or o∣ther
such Catastrophies, Metamorphoses, or Mutations as must haue caused
those parts, which were once the bottom of the Sea, to be now, or at the
time when they were so observed, to be dry Land.</P>
<P>That they were so esteemed by divers of the Antients I have in part shewn
and could inlarge upon that Head, but that I would likewise shew that they
have been so esteemed by the most eminent of our Modern Naturalists, and
for this I could produce the Testimonies of <HI>Georgius, Agricola, Cardan, Gesner,
Aldrovandus, Ferranti Imperatus, Wormius, Calceolarius, Bauhinus, Belonius,
Fracastorius, Cisalpinus, Fabius Columba, Stevinus,</HI> and a great many others yet
more Modern, besides the Testimony and Opinion of divers others, who
have themselves declared their judgment by word of Mouth; but this would
be too great a wasting of Time to prove that which carries in itself the true
<HI>Medium</HI> of its Proof and Demonstration, which is by sensible examination.
I shall therefore only give one Instance or two for all, and that is, First, That
of <HI>Fabius Columba,</HI> who has writ a Treatise on purpose to evidence this Truth
by many Arguments; 'tis at the end of his Treatise <HI>De Purpura. Nituntur
quidam</HI> (says he) <HI>acanis Natur &amp; in medium adductis, omni Responsione Seclusa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proofs out of Modern Wri∣ter▪</NOTE>.

<PB N="410" REF="389"/>
which would be too long to trouble you with at this time, and I only proceed∣ed
so far that I might give an occasion to have the Experiment now tried in
the presence of this Society, there being several of that kind in the Reposi∣tory,
and the trial being very easy will not be long in making, all things be∣ing
in a readiness for it. I shall only add one more Testimony, which is of
<HI>Andreas Cisalpinus</HI> in his first Book <HI>de Re Metallica</HI> and second Chapter. <HI>In
fodinis metallorum seu Marmorum</HI> (says he) <HI>aliorum{que} Saxorum Nunquam vivens
Corpus Reperitur. Etsi enim aliquando in eorum Caesura ostrearum testae aut caetera
Conchilia Reperta sunt; haec recedente Mari &amp; Lapidescente Solo inihi derelicta in La∣pides

animalem, intra Lapides, rudimenta animalium ac plantarum Gignere ut quidam pu∣tant.</HI>
He hath not told where <HI>Aristotle</HI> hath maintained this Doctrine; but
whosoever shall examine his Writings, shall, by many Passages in them find,
that he was fully of this Judgment: And more fully in the fourteenth Chap∣ter
of the first Book of <HI>Meteors,</HI> where also he confirms the same Sentiments
of <HI>Herodotus,</HI> which I have newly quoted; and concurs likewise with the Do∣ctrine
of the alterations that are caused by slow degrees of Progress, which I
have Hypothetically explained by the Oval Figure of the Earth, and the al∣teration
of that shorter Axis to differing parts of the Earth: But this only
by the bye to shew how much soever than Hypothesis were exploded by a
learned Dr., by reason of the Consequences that would follow from it; yet
<HI>Aristotle</HI> (though he hath not explained by what means and in what manner)
hath asserted Mutations as great and much after the same method of Pro∣gression,
as those which are alledged to be the <HI>extravagant Consequences of that
Hypothesis,</HI> some of which I shall have occasion to mention at another time.
So that to conclude for this time I hope I have shewn good grounds to evince.
First, That these kind of Bodies are either Animal or Vegetable Substances
Secondly, That the places where these are found must have sometimes been
covered with the Sea. Thirdly, That the general Deluge of <HI>Noah</HI> was not of
duration enough to effect it, unless the manner of it effecting were after that
which I proposed, by changing that part which was before dry Land into Sea,
by sinking; and that which was Sea into dry Land, by ri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing underneath it
Fourthly, That the universality of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> over the whole Earth seem
to argue for this manner. Fifthly, That there have been several particular
Floods, as that of <HI>Deucal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> which being caused, for the
most part, by Earthquakes, may have been the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of divers particular
<HI>Phaenomena,</HI> such as the raising of some part, from under the Sea, and the sin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing
of others into it, or into <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>The former Lecture was read <HI>Feb.</HI> 15th. 1688.</P>
<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 29. 1688. I have, in my former Lecture, proved how early and how
generally the Phaenomena of Shells were taken notice of by the most antient
Historians and Philosophers, and I could have given many other Instances to
confirm it, if it had been thought necessary. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> I conceived, might
be continually revived the Traditions and Theories concerning preceding
Floods and other Catastrophies that had happened to the Earth in Ages long
preceding. But because, among the Philosophers, I only quoted that place
in <HI>Plat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> about the <HI>Atlanti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> which was thought to be a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iction (however that
shewed he had such a notion) and the Doctrine or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as reported by
<HI>Ovid,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oufs out of Aristotle.</NOTE> which was thought Poetical (tho' a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I conceive <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those Mythologies
have certain Historical and real Truths thereby represented) I shall there∣fore
add one out of <HI>Artistotle</HI> which I hinted the last Day out of his first Book
of Meteors. “The same parts of the Earth (says he) are not always dry or
moist, but they receive a change from the increase or defect of River,
therefore parts bounding Sea and Land change often, nor is the same part
always Sea or always Land, but it is changed in time, and that which was, Sea
is Land, and that which was Land is Sea; but this is in a long process▪
This arrives from interior changes of the Earth, which from a long Consti∣tution
grows old, as the Bodies of Plant and Animals, and that not singly the
<PB N="411" REF="390"/>
Parts but the whole. It may therefore for a time be moist, and by degrees
grow dry and old: This may happen both by the decreasing of Rivers and also
of the Sea; but these happen not, but in a long time, in comparison of our
short Life, which is the cause they are not noted, the change being so little
in the space of one Life, and so several Ages pass before they are finished;
whence the memory of them is loft. (He adds much more to the same effect
to explain his Notion) Exemplifying his Doctrine by <HI>Aegypt,</HI> which (says
he) has been all made by Mud of Rivers, and is observed continually to
grow drier, and the Lakes filling up by degrees have been inhabited, and
length of time has obliterated the memory of such changes; for all the pre∣sent
Mouths of <HI>Nile,</HI> except the <HI>Canobic,</HI> have been cut by Art; for old
<HI>Aegypt</HI> was that only about <HI>Thebes,</HI> as <HI>Homer</HI> testifies, who lived not long
after these Changes; for he mentions <HI>Thebes</HI> only as if <HI>Memphis</HI> had not yet
then been, so he proceeds in explicating, and instances again in saying, so
marshy places grow better by draining, but dry grow worse and barren, as
it has happened to the Country about the <HI>Argives,</HI> and the <HI>Mycenaeans,</HI> and
what has happened to these parts, the same may be conceived of the whole.
So many parts which have been Sea have been added to the Continent; and
the contrary, those that do <HI>respicere and pauca,</HI> ascribe these changes to the
Heavens, but they are mistaken, but they are to be ascribed to Causes that
happen after a long process of time, as that of <HI>Deucalion</HI>'s Flood, which hap∣pened
only to <HI>Greece</HI> about that part which is called old <HI>Hellas,</HI> which is
that about the present <HI>Dodon</HI> and <HI>Achelou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> this happened from great abun∣dance
of Rains which are generated by the Mountains, which are by de∣grees
changed and so produce differing effects. He exemplifies his Doctrine
further by <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and the Country where the Oracles of <HI>Jupiter Ammon</HI>
was, saying, Twas formerly Marshy, but by degrees dried and grew parched;
so not only the present most famous Rivers will come in long process of time
to be dried and changed, but the Sea also; and that which was Sea will be
Land, and the Land will be Sea.” I have here given the sum of his Doctrine
which he doth much inlarge upon to explain it; but to save time, I have only
abstracted the meaning, and given you the Epitomy of it that may easily e∣nough
be more fully explained or read at large in the fourthteenth Chapter of
his first Book of <HI>Meteors.</HI> By the whole it plainly appears, that <HI>Aristotle</HI> was
of the Opinion that all the dry Land or the Earth had been sometimes cover∣ed
with the Sea, which he seems to be informed of by the then present <HI>Phae∣nomena,</HI>
as he plainly expresses in his description of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and of the Coun∣try
about the Oracle or <HI>Jupiter Ammon;</HI> and 'tis not to be doubted but one
of those <HI>Phaenomena</HI> and possibly not the least considerable was that of the Sea∣sand
and Shells, which I shewed the last Day <HI>Herodotus</HI> had taken notice of. I
do therefore humbly conceive (tho' some possibly may think there is too much
notice taken of such a trivial thing as a rotten Shell, yet) that Men do gene∣rally
too much slight and pass over without regard these Records of Antiqui∣ty
which Nature have left as Monuments and Hieroglyphick Characters of
preceding Transactions in the like duration or Transactions of the Body of the
Earth, which are insinirely more evident and certain tokens than any thing of
Antiquity that can be fetched out of Coins or Medals, or any other way yet
known, since the best of those ways may be counterfeited or made by Art and
Design, as may also Books, Manuscripts and Inscriptions, as all the Learned
are now sufficiently satisfied, has often been actually practised; but those
Characters are not to be counterfeited by all the Craft in the World, nor can
they be doubted to be, what they appear, by any one that will impartially ex∣amine
the true appearances of them: And tho' it must be granted, that it is
very difficult to read them, and to raise <HI>Chronology</HI> out of them, and to state
the intervalls of the Times wherein such, or such Catastrophies and Mutati∣ons
have happened; yet 'tis not impossible, but that, by the help of those
joined to other means and assistances of Information, much may be done even
in that part of Information also. And tho' possibly some may say, I have
turned the World upside down for the sake of a Shell, yet, as I think, there
is no one has reason for any such assertion from any action I have hitherto
done; yet if by means of so slight and trivial Signs and Tokens as these are,
<PB N="412" REF="391"/>
there can be Discoveries made and certain-Conclusions drawn of infinitely
more important Subjects; I hope the attempts of that kind do no ways de∣serve
reproach, since possibly 'tis not every one that takes notice of them,
nor one of a hundred that does, that will think of a reason; besides, much
greater conclusions have been deduced from less evident and more inconsider∣able
Marks, if we respect Bulk, Magnitude, or Number, and much more
weighty Consequences may, and will in time, be drawn from seemingly more
trivial, and much lighter and slighter Indications, yet where the Testimonies
are clear, certain and self-evident, they are not to be rejected for their bulk,
tho' it be, so small as no Eye or Sense can reach it unless assisted by Engines,
as the Sight by a Microscope, Telescope, and the like: In how few Letters,
Words, or Characters is the History of the World before <HI>Noah</HI>'s Flood? Is
it therefore not to be believed because we have not as many Volumes of its
History as there are now to be found words? In how little room will the Hi∣story
of the flood be contained if <HI>Homer</HI>'s Iliads could be boxed in a Nut∣shell?
But to leave every one to the freedom of his own Thoughts, I shall pro∣ceed
to what I thought was further necessary to be added to what I hinted the
last Day, which was concerning the Flood of <HI>Noah,</HI> because I find the gene∣rality
of those who indeavour to give a solution of these <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> are in∣clinea
to ascribe them to the effects of that Flood, and because what I then
said Was but in brief, and so possibly what I design might not be so plainly ap∣prehended,
or it may be misconstrued, I thought it might be necessary to ex∣plain
it a little more fully. I said then, that I conceived that those universal
<HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the remainders of the Sea which are found in all parts almost of
the present superficial Parts of the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A farther ex∣plication of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Flood. and the forma∣tion of the world.</NOTE> could not be caused by the general
Flood of <HI>Noah,</HI> if the manner of performance and executing thereof were
such as is for the generality supposed and explained by Commentators by reas∣on
that they make the time of the continuance of the present superficial▪
Parts of the Earth under the Waters to be no longer than the time of the
duration of the Flood, as it is recorded in Holy Writ. Supposing that the
present Earth and Sea is in the same places with respect to the Body of the
Earth as they were before the Flood; nor will the Hypothesis or Explication
of the ingenious Author that has lately writ of that Subject, reach it, he
supposing there was no apparent Sea before the Flood, but that the Sea was
all covered by the Earth, if at least I do rightly comprehend his intentions;
for that space of time will not be found of duration long enough to produce
<HI>de novo</HI> such multitudes of those Creatures, and to such Magnitudes and Ages
of growth as many of them seem to have had, and it will be difficult to be
imagined, that such Creatures as do not swim in the Water, should, by the
Effects of that Deluge, be taken from their Residences in the bottom of the
Sea and carried to the top of the Mountains, or to places so far remote from
those Residences. So then, if we will ascribe those Phaenomena to that Flood,
it will be necessary to consider which way that Catastrophy might be effected
that it might be the occasion of such effect, I therefore said, that un∣less
we supposed that there were thereby a change wrought of the superficial Parts
of the Globe, and that those parts which before the Flood were dry Land be∣came
Sea, and the parts which were before covered by the Sea after the said
Deluge, became the dry Land, it seems to me, thase appearances cannot
be solved by <HI>Noah</HI>'s Flood.</P>
<P>Tho' possibly this may seem a little improbable upon the first mentioning
of it, yet possibly also upon a little further examination, it may be thought
to have somewhat more of liklyhood than is yet imagined, at least I hope the
manner will be conceivable.</P>
<P>We have no other means of being informed of the true History of it, but
what is to be found recorded in the sacred Writing of <HI>Moses;</HI> and therefore
those are to be consulted, and the true meaning of them, as far as can be,
must be obtained; for whatever else may be s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ered here and there in other
Authors that seem to relate thereunto in all probability, were some way or o∣ther
fe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ched from his Informations.</P>
<P><PB N="413" REF="392"/>
I conceive then, that considering the Descriptions of <HI>Moses</HI> both of the Ge∣neration
of the Earth and manner of the Flood, the History of both may be
thus explained.</P>
<P>First, For the Fabrick of the Earth, the Description is but short in the
first Chapter of <HI>Genesis</HI> and 2d Verse. <HI>Et terra erat Solitudo &amp; Inanitas &amp; Ca∣ligo
Super facies abyssi, &amp; Spiritus Dei manabat Super facies aquarum, &amp; dixit Deus
sit lux &amp; fuit lux.</HI> This doth seem to represent the order of the four Grada∣tions,
Earth in the middle, Water next, then Spiritus, then Light; the
Central Earth is described only as a <HI>Vacuum,</HI> and called the <HI>Abysse,</HI> and
Darkness inclosing it; that is, the Water follows next above it, which co∣vered
it all round: Above this the Air, and lastly the Fire, Aether, or Light
in the fourth Verse, according to the Hebrew, <HI>Et divisit Deus inter Lucem &amp;
inter tenebras:</HI> The Septuagint renders it, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
That is, God caused a twofold Seperation, one in the
middle of the Light or Aether, and another in the middle of the Darkness,
which covered the Face of the Abysse or Central Earth; which covering of
Darkness was the Water, which is often called the Abysse or great Deep;
the former of these is afterwards always called the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
the Firmament of Heaven, to distinguis it from the latter, called the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
the Firmament in the middle of the Waters; for in the sixth
Verse it is so exprest, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Let
there be a Firmament in the middle of the Waters, and let it be a division be∣tween
the Waters and the Waters: And in the seventh Verse; and God made
the Firmament, and God made a separation of the Waters that were below
the Firmament, from the Waters that were above the Firmament. And in
the eighth Verse, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; it is generally rendered,
and God called the Firmament Heaven; I conceive it may be rendered, Also
God called the Heaven the Firmament, for to shew that there was also a Fir∣mament
of the Heavens; for so it is afterward every where called, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
But this I submit to Divines.</P>
<P>This first Firmament then, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, seems to have been a solid
and hard Sphaerical Shell, as it were, which incompassed the Ball of the Earth
Central, not clear without the Liquid Water, as the hard Shell of the Egg
is without the White, and so the Egg-shell doth inclose the whole White of
the Egg, as well as the White incloseth the Yolk: But it was, as I conceive,
meant, that this Firmament or Sphaerical hard Shell was placed, as it were,
in the middle of all the White, or of the incompassing Water; the Circum∣ferential
half of it being without the Shell, and the Central half of it with∣in
in the Shell. So then at its first Creation, the order was first the Central
Earth or great Abysse; this was in the middle as the Yolk of the Egg round or
Sphaerical; this was inclosed in Darkness by the Shell of Water underneath
the Firmament, being half the whole Body of the Water which was inclosed
perfectly within this Firmament, as the White of the Egg by the Egg-shell;
and by that hard Shell it was perfectly seperated from the other half of the
Water which was above the Firmament, and as it were a second, White of
the Egg without the Shell, and was the Water upon the Face of which the
Spirit was said to move; so that the whole Globe, for that time, was all co∣vered
with Water. This <HI>Ovid</HI> seems to allude to, when he faith, <HI>Circumfluns
humor ultimo Possedit, Solidumg; coercuit orbem;</HI> which I took notice of in my
Lecture about the History of the World, as expressed by that ingenious My∣thologick
Poet; for he seems to make the Water to be both below the Shell
of the Earth and to encompass it.</P>
<P><HI>Plato also</HI> was of that Opinion in making <HI>Tartarus</HI> the place of the Waters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">of Tartarus</NOTE>
that is the middle and Central parts of the Ball or Globe of the Earth; and
so the hard part of the Earth to be nothing but this Shell near the Superfi∣cies,
and it seems also, that <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> yea, and the <HI>AEgyptians</HI> and <HI>Chaldeans</HI>
likewise were of the same Sentiment, and divers are of Opinion that <HI>Moses</HI>
also understood the same by the great Abysse which he mentions in the De∣scription
of <HI>Noah's</HI> Flood. Butt by this Description of the Creation he seems to
be understood otherwise, when he says, <HI>Et terra er at Sclitudo &amp; Inanitas &amp; Caligo
super sacies Abyssi.</HI> For by this he seems to make the form of the Terraqueous
<PB N="414" REF="393"/>
Globe to be no other than of a Bubble, such as Children blow into
the Air, that is only a Sphaericla film or Orb of Water, which within it had
nothing but <HI>Solitudo &amp; Inanitas, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Vacuum &amp; Fnane,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
and only that this Film of Water was divided in the middle by the
solid hard shell of the Firmament which inclosed half the Film; that is, the
inner side; and excluded the other half of the Film; that is, the outward
superficial Parts: And hence 'tis possible that <HI>Virgil</HI> in the eighth Book of his
<HI>Aeneids, says, Spiritus Intus alit, totam{que} infusa per Artus men agitat molem &amp;
mago se Corpore miscet. Inde hominum pecudum{que} genus vitae{que} volantum &amp; quae
marmoreo fert monstra sub aequore pontus, &amp;c.</HI> He seeming there to make the
place for the Soul of the World; others there are who would have it to be
Fire, and thence to proceed the Causes of the Vulcanos and fiery Eruption;
but <HI>Aristotle</HI> there places the pure Element of the Earth; some of the Mo∣dern
Philosophers would hav it to be all one great Load-stone. I could pro∣duce
various other Opinions, but they are all but Opinions; and it matters
not much what the substance be that f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lls, it, as to the present inquiery; I shall
therefore proceed.</P>
<P>This Firmament then in the middle of the Waters, I take to be that which
in many places of the Bible is said to be the Foundation of the Earth, as in
<HI>Psal. 24. 2. The Earth is the Lords and the fullneds, thereos for he hath founded it
upon the Seas.</HI> (Prov. 3. 19.) <HI>The Lord by wisdom hath founded the Earth, by un∣derstanding
hath he establis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hed the Heavens,</HI> (this seems to refer to the two Fir∣maments)
and in the following Verse, <HI>By his knowledge the depths are broken at
and the Clouds drop down their Lew.</HI> (This seems to refer to the Causes of the
general Deluge by opening to those two Firmaments, as I shall by and by shew.)
<HI>So Job 38. 6. Whereupon are the Foundations of the Earth fastned?</HI></P>
<P>This Sphaerical Firmament or Shell then in the middle of the Waters, we
may suppose, was in some places raised or forced outwards, and some other
parts were pressed downwards or inwards, and sunk lower, when in the
ninth Verse, God commanded the Waters under the Heaven to be gathered
together to one place, and the dry Land to appear; for by depressing in or
some parts of that Sphaerical Shell (to make room to receive all the Waters
that had before covered the whole) other parts must be thrust out, the Con∣tents
within being the same, and so requiring equal Space or Extension; so
that what went below the former Sphaerical Surface, must be equalled by o∣ther
parts ascending without that Surface, and so the quantities of the Wa∣ters
both within it, and those without it, remained each the same, and stil
distinct and separated by this Firmament in the middle of the Waters, tho'
altered from its Sphaerical Figure; and the outward Surface of the outward
Water, as well as the inward Surface of the inward Water, must remain
Sphaerical, because of the Power of Gravity from without a Central Earth,
or Yolk within, formed of a Sphaerical Figure.</P>
<P>In this State the Earth seems to remain till the time of the Flood, which is
accounted between sixteen and seventeen Hundred Years according to the
Hebrew. When <HI>God looked upon the Earth, and behold it was corrupt, for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
flesh had corrupted their may upon the Earth, as</HI> Chap. VI. V. 12. And in the
thirteenth told <HI>Noah,</HI> that he would destroy all living Creatures with the Flood▪
This Destruction began in six Hundred Years of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Life, Chap. VI.
V. II. The manner of which was expressed thus in the Septugint <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
<HI>The foun∣tains
of the great deep mere drawn up, and the windows of Heaven were opened.</HI> This
refers again to the twofold Firmament, that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
As for that of the Heavens the effects of the opening of them was, that it Rained
40 Days and 40 Nights; but the Consequents of the other are not expressed
any otherwise, but that the Flood was upon the Earth forty Days, that is, the
Sea continued to flow in upon it. <HI>And the Waters intereased, and bare up the
Ark, and it was lifted up above the Earth, V. 17. And the Waters prevailed ex∣ceedingly
upon the Earth, and all the high Halls, that were undea the whole Heavens,
were covered, V. 19. Fifteen Cubits upwards did the Waters prevail, and the
Mountains were covered, V. 20. Every living substance was destroyed which was Upon
the Face of the around,</HI> Noah <HI>only, and those with him on the Ark, remarked a∣live,
<PB N="415" REF="394"/>
v.</HI> 23 By which it appears, that not only all Men, Beasts, Cattle, Fowls, In∣sects,
Worms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> perished by the Flood, but every living Substance; that
is, all Vegetables also; for all Animals were enumerated before: We see there∣fore
that here was a double Cause of the Waters. First, The Rain from a∣bove.
And, Secondly, The pulling up of the Fountains of the great Deep:
What I understand by the great Deep, I shewed before; that is, the sinkings in∣ward
of the Firmament in the middle of the Waters; and the forcing up of the
Fountains of the great Deep, I conceive to signify the raising again of those parts
that were before sunk to receive the Sea; and a Consequent of that would ne∣cessarily
be a sinking of that which was the dry Land, and a Consequent of that,
flowing and increasing of the Sea from out of that which was the great Deep,
and a prevailing and increasing upon that which was a sinking Earth; and this
motion being forty Days in progression before the rising Surface of the Sea,
and the sinking Surface of the highest Land met. So long the Waters Were
said to be flowing and increasing before it was wholly covered; nay, the Hi∣story
goes on with the Journal of its progress, till the Waters were gotten fif∣teen
Cubits above the highest Mountains; but then the account ceaseth, and
adds only, that the Waters prevailed on the Earth a hundred and fifty Days,
and so long the whole Firmament was covered with Water. So that in pro∣bability
the progress of the alteration of the Firmament proceeded so far till it
recovered its perfect Sphaerical Figure truly in the middle of the Waters, as
it was at its first Creation placed at about seventy five Days after the forty;
but as I conceive it staid not there, but the progression of both the parts went
onwards; that is, the sinking parts went as much below the Level, as before
they were above, and the rising parts by degrees ascended as much above as
they had been below, and that which had been the bottom of the Sea under
the Water, became the dry Land, and that which had been before the dry
Land, now became the bottom of the Sea, whether the Waters retreated
from off these parts which were raised when the Flood was finished; for it is
said in the eighth Chap. That God remembred <HI>Noah,</HI> and what was with him
in the Ark, to prepare them another Habitation, by making dry Land for
them again; and, First, The Heavens were cleared from Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning. And,
Secondly, By turning of the Water that had fallen, into Vapours, and by turning
all those Vapours, which such a Commotion or the Earth and Sea had caused,
into Wind, and by causing the Waters to return from those parts which it
had covered into the Deeps that were appointed for their Reception; so
that at the end of the hundred and fifty Days the new Earth began to appear.
<HI>Ver. 3. And the Waters returned from off the Earth continually, and after the end
of the hundred and fifty Days the Waters mere abated.</HI> And, <HI>v. 4. And the Ark
rested in the seventh Month, on the seventeenth day of the Month, upon the Moun∣tains
of</HI> Ararat, which probably was the Name of the Mountain after the
Flood in the time of <HI>Moses.</HI> Ver. 5. <HI>And the Waters decreased continually until
the tenth month, when the tops of the Mountains were seen. Forty days after this
<HI>Noah</HI> opened the Windows of his Ark and sent out a Raven.</HI> So that it seems that
as the old was forty Days in being covered, so the new was forty Days is be∣ing
discovered; but <HI>Noah</HI> staid yet many Days longer before the Surface of
the Ground was dried. This Explication, I think, doth fully, answer to the
words of the History of the Flood as they are written, by <HI>Moses;</HI> and will
likewise shew a probable Cause how those Phaenomena of Sea-sand and Shells
are become so universal over the Face of the whole Earth, as it is at pre∣sent,
which were the two things which I now indeavoured to make intelligi∣ble.
I have not, I hope, given any Explication, or made any Supposition,
how differing soever it be, from all the Explications I have yet met with, that
will any ways distort the plain words of the Text; for I have in this, as near
as may be, guided my progress by that Direction, and I hope I have hereby
shewed a very plain and intelligible way how the Flood became so perfectly
universal, and the Earth returned perfectly to its primitive and first Created
Figure, without any extravagant supposition of new Created Waters, or
bringing them down from above the highest Heavens; nor is here any great
need of Calculation to know how great a quantity of Water would need to
be new Created and afterwards Annihilated, or first fetcht down from the
<PB N="416" REF="395"/>
Heavens, and then sent back again; nor is there any need of supposing the
Earth to be broken to pieces since the Flood, and the Antediluvian World
without any visible Sea. And if it were much to the purpose, I could shew
how all this, that I have supposed, may be Physically explained, and the Ae∣quilibrium
maintained: And, in short, to shew how consonant this Hypothe∣sis
may be both to several Expressions in the most antient Authors, and, in a
word, with the Rules of Nature itself, of which I have formerly given divers
hints to this Society, and may some other time more fully explain, but I fear
I have detained you too long at this time.</P>

<HEAD><DATE>July 23. 1690.</DATE> A Discourse of Earthquakes in the Leeward Islands.</HEAD>
<P>THE greatest Objection that has hitherto been made against a Theory
which I have several times discoursed of, to give a rational and pro∣bable
account of the Reasons of the varieties observable in the present superfi∣cial
Parts of the Globe of the Earth; which was, that all those inequalities of
its Surface had been caused by the Power of Earthquakes, or Eruptions of
fiery Conflagrations in kindled in the Subterraneous Regions, which by that
means did sometimes raise Mountains, Hills, Islands, &amp;c. and sometimes
produce the quite contrary Effects, by levelling of Eminences or sinking of
Places, swallowing up Rivers, and making Lakes of Land, or sinking Lands
under the Sea, and the like.</P>
<P>The greatest Objection, I say, against this, I find hath been, that there
were wanting Instances to confirm it from History. For that, all Places,
Countries, Seas, Rivers, Islands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have all continued the same for so long
time as we can reach backwards with any History: All <HI>Greece</HI> and the <HI>Greecian
Islands, Italy, Aegypt,</HI> &amp;c. are all the same as they were above two Thousand
years since, and therefore they were so from the Creation▪ and will be so to
the general Conflagration; and as to the effects of Earthquakes, First, They
have happened but seldom: And, Secondly, They have not produced any no∣table
Change, such as I have supposed them to be the Authors and Efficients
of; so that it seems but a bare Conjecture and without Ground or Foundation
sufficient to found and raise such a Superstructure of Conclusions as I have
thereupon raised.</P>
<P>For Answer to which I shall not now repeat what I have formerly produc∣ed
here, and alledged to that purpose, such as were the Instances that were to
be met with here and there dispersed in antient Writings; since many of those▪
Occurencies having been long since produced, and the relations of them made
by such as were not Eye-witnesses, many of the particular matters of Fact
have been doubted or disputed; I shall therefore take notice of some particu∣lar▪
Instances which have happened within our own Memory, and more par∣ticularly
of this late instance which hath happened in the <HI>Antilles,</HI> of which
we have an account but this last Month in the <HI>Gazer,</HI> namely, in that of <HI>June</HI>
the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0th.</HI> and another in that of <HI>June</HI> the 16th. preceding; both which Re∣lations,
tho' they are but short and imperfect, as to what I could have wish∣ed
and shall indeavour to obtain, yet as they are, they will be found to contain
<PB N="417" REF="396"/>
many Particulars, which do very much illustrate and confirm my Conjectures.
And tho' the particular effects were not so great as to equalize those which
I have supposed to have been the productions of former Eruptions, such as
the raising of the <HI>Alpes, Pyreneans, Appennines, Andes,</HI> and the like Moun∣tains,
or the making of new Lands, lslands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or the sinking of Countries,
and drowning of Islands as the <HI>Platonick Atlantis</HI> and contiguous Islands, yet
if they be considered they will be found to be of the same Nature, and to dif∣fer
only in Magnitude, <HI>Secundum Magis &amp; Minus,</HI> but not in Essence.</P>

“[On <HI>Sunday</HI> the sixth Instant, about five a Clock in the Evening, was, for
some few Minutes, heard a strange hollow noise, which was thought to pro∣ceed
from the great Mountain in the middle of this Island, to the admira∣tion
of all People; but immediately after, to their greater Amazement, be∣gan
a mighty Earthquake, with that violence, that almost all the Houses
in <HI>Charles</HI> Town, that were built of Brick or Stone, were in an instance le∣velled
with the Ground, and those built of Timber shook, that every Body
made what hast they could to get out of them. In the Streets the Ground
in several places clove about two Foot asunder, and hot stinking Water
spouted out of the Earth a great height. The Sea left its usual Bounds more
than a third of a Mile, so that very large Fish lay bare upon the Shoar,
but the Water presently returned again. And afterwards the same strange
motion happened several times, but the Water retired not so far as at first.
The Earth, in many places, was thrown up in great quantities, and thous∣ands
of large Trees went with it, which were buried and no more seen.
Tis usual almost at every House to have a large Cistern, to contain the Rain∣water
of above nine or ten Foot deep, and fifteen or twenty Foot Diameter,
several of which, with the violence of the Earthquake, threw out the Wa∣ter
eight or ten Foot high; and the motion of the Earth all over the Island
was such, that nothing could be more terrible. 'In the Island of St. <HI>Chri∣stophers</HI>
(as some <HI>French</HI> Gentlemen, who are come hither to treat about the
exchange of Prisoners, do Report) there has likewise been an Earthquake,
the Earth opening in many places nine Foot, and burying solid Timber, Su∣gar-mills,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and throwing down the Jesuits Colledge, and all other Stone
Buildings. It was also in a manner as violent at <HI>Antego</HI> and <HI>Montserrat;</HI>
and they had some feeling of it at <HI>Barbadoes.</HI> Several small Earthquakes
have happened since, three or four in twenty four Hours; some of which
made the biggest Rocks have a great motion, but we are now in great hopes
there will be no more.”]</P>
<P>This is the whole of the Relation from <HI>Nevis.</HI> But the other Account▪ from
<HI>Barbadoes,</HI> of the 23rd. of <HI>April,</HI> taketh notice of other particulars than what
are mentioned in this Letter; the Printed Account is this that follows.
[“About three Weeks since there were felt most violent Earthquakes in the
<HI>Leeward Islands</HI> of <HI>Montserrat, Nevit</HI> and <HI>Antego;</HI> in the two first no consi∣derable
hurt was done, most of their Buldings being of Timber; but where
there were Stone Buildings they were generally thrown down, which fell ve∣ry
hard in <HI>Antego,</HI> most of their Houses, Sugar-mills and Wind-mills being
of Stone. This Earthquake was felt in some places of this Island, but did
no manner of hurt to Men or Cattle; nor was any lost in the <HI>Leeward Islands,</HI>
it happening in the Day-time. It is reported to have been yet more violent
in <HI>Martinico,</HI> and other <HI>French</HI> Islands. And several Sloops who came from
<HI>Nevis</HI> and <HI>Antego</HI> passing between St. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ucia</HI> and <HI>Martinico</HI> felt it at Sea: The
agitation of the Water being so violent, that they thought themselvcs on
Rocks and Shelves, the Vessels shaking as if they would break in pieces.
And others passing by a Rock and inhabited Island, called <HI>Rodund<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> found
the Earthquake so violent there, that a great part of that Rocky Island split
and tumbled into the Sea, and was there sunk, making a noise as of many
Cannon, and a very great Cloud of Dust ascending into the Air at the fall.”]
[“Two very great Comets have lately appeared in these parts of the World,
and in an Hour and a quarters time the Sea Ebbed and Flowed to an unusu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l
degree three times.”] In these Relations are many considerable Effects
produced, which will much confirm my former Doctrine about the Effects of
<PB N="418" REF="397"/>
Earthquakes. And First, It is very remarkable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Observables in this Earthquake</NOTE> that this Earthquake was not
confined to a small spot or place of the Earth, such as the Er<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ption of <HI>Ae∣na</HI>
or <HI>Vesuvi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> out of one Mouth, but it extended above five Degrees, or
three hundred and fifty Miles in length; namely, from <HI>Barbadoes</HI> to St. <HI>Chri∣stophers,</HI>
and possibly, upon inquiry, it may be found to have gone a great
deal further, and to have produced Effects in <HI>Statia</HI> St. <HI>Martin, Anguilla, Por∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o
Rico,</HI> or some other of those Islands in the North-west or St. <HI>Christophers,</HI>
where, by the Relation, it seemis to have been the most violent: And tho'
possibly there might not be opportunities of fe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling or taking notice of the
effects in all places of the Sea where it might have been felt; yet by those
few Instances which are related, we may probably conjecture, that its effects
might be very considerable, and sensible a great way in breadth under the Sea;
for we find that the Strokes or Succusions thereof were felt by the Vessels
sayling over some parts of the Sea so affected; and those so violent as if the
Vessels had struck upon Rocks, which could be from nothing else but the sud∣dain
rising of the bottom of the Sea, which raised the Sea also with it, like
Water in a Tub or Dish: And that this was of that Nature does further ap∣pear
by the unusual Tides at the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> mentioned in the last Relation,
<HI>viz.</HI> That in an Hour and ¼ the Sea Ebbed and Flowed three times in an un∣usual
Degree; which, in probability, were nothing else but Waves propa∣gated
from the places where the Ground underneath, and the Sea above, had
been by the Concussions of the Earthquake raised upwards. This appears also
farther by the recess of the Sea from the Shore at <HI>Nevis <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of a Mile; for the
whole Island being raised by the Swelling or Eruption of the Vapour or Fire
underneath, made the Sea run off from the Shores, till it settled down again
into its place after the Vapour had broken its way out through the Clefts that
were made by those Swellings: From all which Particulars, and several others,
'tis manifest, that the space of Earth raised or struck upwards by the impe∣tuosity
of the Subterraneous Powers that caused it, was of great Extent, and
might far exceed the length of the <HI>Alps,</HI> or the <HI>Pyreneans,</HI> &amp;c. But there
may be other Instances also produced of the great extent of the Powers or
Effects of Earthquakes, as those I have formerly mentioned to have happened
in <HI>Norway</HI> about thirty Years since; and those which happened in the Nor∣them
parts of <HI>America</HI> of a later date.</P>
<P>Another particular notable in this, is the Recess of the Sea from the Shore,
and the leaving the Fish upon the so raised bottom; and tho' this part soon
after sunk again, so that the Sea returned to its former bounds, yet if some
other parts of the Subterraneous Ground had filled up the made Cavity, or
that they had so tumbled as to support the so raised parts, Instances of which
kinds of Accidents may be produced from other Earthquakes, then it would
have left some such kind of Tract as it is now in <HI>Virginia,</HI> where, for many
Miles in length, the Low-land is nothing but Sea-sand and Shells, which
have been, in probability, so raised into the Air, and there supported and
continued from sinking again and being covered with the Sea: Of Shells taken
up from this Tract, there can be no doubt that they have belonged to Fish
of their kind, they remaining hitherto perfect Scallop Shells; of which kind
there are some in the Repository.</P>
<P>A Third particular Remarkable, is the overturning and burying of thou∣sands
of Trees which were no more seen, being covered by the Earth which
was thrown up by the Eruption. This gives us a very plain Instance of the
manner how Trees that are now found in divers parts of <HI>England</HI> buried un∣der
the Ground, may have come to have been there so disposed and deposit∣ed;
for tho' possibly in those places there may be no such Trees now grow∣ing;
and tho' we have no History when there were, or of any such Eruption
that might have so overturned and buried them; yet the Records that we
have of the antient or former State of those Parts, are not so full and particu∣lar,
but that we may well enough suppose that such Catastrophies may have
happened long since we have begun to have Writings and Records in <HI>England;</HI>
that is, since the time that the <HI>Romans</HI> first conquered this Isle; and yet not
find any mention thereof there made; since possibly those that might be in
or near those Parts might have perish'd with it, and those which were at a
<PB N="419" REF="398"/>
distance took little notice or regard of what they had little concern for: Be∣sides,
in those Days very small were the number that could Write and Read,
and fewer were those that minded any thing the effects produced by Nature:
What was written was either somewhat relating to Religion or Civil History,
very few and rare are the Instances that can be met with of Natural History;
and it has not been a Defect peculiar to these parts of the World only, but
was taken notice of two Thousand Years since by <HI>Aristotle</HI> upon this very ac∣count,
as we find in the fourteenth Chapter of his first Book of <HI>Meteors;</HI>
“Moreover (says he in the beginning of this Chapter) the same Parts of the
Earth are not always dry Land, or always covered with Water, but they
suffer a change from the rising of new Rivers, or decay and drying of old;
therefore also in places near the Sea there are wont to happen these changes.
So that those which are Land, or those which are Sea do not always re∣main
so; but where was Land there is Sea, and where was Sea there is Land;
and we are to conclude these changes to happen according to some order.
Now (says he) because many of these changes happen but slowly in com∣parison
to the quickness and shortness of the Life of Man, therefore they
are hardly taken notice of, a whole Generation having passed away before
such changes have come to perfection. Other Catastrophies that have been
more quick, have been forgotten, by reason that such as escaped them were
removed to some other parts, and there the Memory of them was soon lost;
at least a longer tract of Time did quite obliterate the remembrance of
them, and the transplanting and transmigration of People from place to
place much contributed thereunto.” This is made plain enough by the lit∣tle
remembrance was found in <HI>America</HI> of their preceding Estate, when they
were first visited by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and other <HI>Europeans.</HI></P>
<P>A fourth particular Remarkable in these Relations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">of the Veins Marble.</NOTE> is the Chapping and
cleaving of the Earth and Rocks, and the spouting out of them of stinking
Water to a great height; as also of Smoke or Dust, which serves to explain
the Reason and Causes of the Flaws and Veins in Marbles and other Stones;
for by the Power and Violence of the Subterraneous Heavings or Succussions
the stony Quarries become broken, flawed and cleft, and Subterraneous Mine∣ral
Waters impregnated with Saline, Metalline, Sulphureous, or other Sub∣stances
are driven into them and fill them up, which having petrified Qua∣lities
in them, do, in process of time, petrify in those Clefts, and thereby
form a sort of stony Veins of different Colour, Hardness, and other Quali∣fications,
than what the parts of the broken Quarry had before, and oft time
inclose divers other Substances by their petrifying Quality, which have hap∣pened
to fall into those Clefts, and thence sometimes there are found Shells
petrified in the middle of the Vein, as I have seen, and other Substances.
These Clifts or Chaps hapening not only upon the Land, but even under the
Sea; so that not only the Sea-water may descend and fill up those Clefts, but
it may carry with it Sands, Shells, Mud, and divers other Substances from the
bottom of the Sea, that then lay above it, there to be, in process of time,
changed into Stone somewhat of the Nature of that which hath been so
cleft.</P>
<P>Fifthly, 'Tis worth noting, that this Earthquake happened at so great a
distance from the main Land and great Continent, and that the noise of the
same was first observed to begin at the great Mountain in the middle of the
Island of <HI>Nevis,</HI> not but that it might in other parts have begun sooner or
at other times; from which I draw these deductions. First, That it seems
probable, that this great Mountain may have been formerly visited with E∣ruptions;
and possibly might have been first produced by some such Power,
and so have great Cavities within its Bowels produced by such a preceding E∣ruption,
the dislocatcd Parts not returning each to its own place. And next,
that it may hence seem probable, that some such preceding Earthquake (tho'
then possibly more violent before the foment of the Fire was by inkindling
exhausted) might, not only be the cause of raising this Mountain, but of
lifting up from the bottom the whole I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le, nay, possibly of all the Islands of
the <HI>Antilles,</HI> since one seems as possible as the other, and the Northern of them
all seems to hint as much, if considered, in the Map; besides, there seems to
<PB N="420" REF="399"/>
be many Instances of a like Nature, as in the <HI>Canaries, Tenariff</HI> seems to be
a most remarkable Character of such a Supposition; to this may be added
<HI>Del Fuogo</HI> among the <HI>Azores</HI> and the Island of <HI>Madera, Sicily, Strombulo,</HI> and
<HI>Lipary</HI> in the <HI>Mediterranean, Iseland</HI> in the North Sea, <HI>Mascarenos</HI> near <HI>Ma∣dagascar;</HI>
to this I may also add the many Islands of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> which,
tho' they have now no great signs of burning Mountains, yet to this Day
Earthquakes are very frequent, and antient Traditions do preserve some∣what
of the memory of very great alterations that have happened those
Parts by such sorts of Causes; but I will not now meddle with that kind of
History, nor of Mythology, having said more concerning if in a more pro∣per
place; but I shall rather on this occasion take notice of those Islands
that have <HI>Vulcanoes</HI> in or near them, which to me seem to proceed from the
same Cause and Principle. And I do not question, but that all those Islands
which lie so far in the Sea, if they were thoroughly examined, would plainly
manifest whence they have proceeded by Characters of Nature's Writing,
which to me seems far beyond any other Record what soever. Here I conceive
it Lawful and Philosophical to <HI>Jurare in Verba,</HI> when Nature speaks or dictates;
however, I shall leave it free to every one to judge, as he thinks most reason∣able.</P>
<P>Sixthly, 'Tis very remarkable that the Isle of <HI>Rodunda,</HI> which it seems is
all an uninhabited Rock, was split, and a part of it tumbled down and sunk
into the Sea; upon which occasion it seems it made a prodigious noise as of
many Cannon, and sending up at the same time a great Cloud of Dust, as
they term it, which, in probability, was also mingled with Smoak. Which
puts me in mind of the Phaenomena I observed lately, when the Pouder-mill
and Magazine at <HI>Hackny</HI> blew up; for besides the very great noise of the
Blow which I heard, being within a Mile of it, in the Fields, I observed im∣mediately,
a great white Cloud of Smoke to rise in a Body to a great height
in the Air, and to be carried by the Wind for two Miles and better without
dispersing or falling down, but perfectly resembling the white Summer Clouds:
But this only by the bye. From these Phaenomena of the Earthquake it seems
very probable, that it proceeded from such▪ Subterraneous in kindling as re∣sembles
Gun-powder, both by the noise it yielded, and in the suddenness of
its firing, and its powerful Expansion when fired; for the noise was as of ma∣ny
Cannon; this alone proves it to be very suddain. Next the splitting of
the Rocky Island proves its Power to be very great; this is proved yet farther
by the Blow and Strokes it communicated to the Sea, and so to the Ships
that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailed upon it; for no slow motion whatever could have communicated
such a Concussion through the Water to the Vessels upon it; but it must be as
suddain as that of Pouder, otherwise the stroke of the Earth upon the in∣cumbent
Seas, would never have had the like success; for if it had been a
gradual rising of the bottom, the Sea would gradually have run off from it,
and upon its sinking again have gradually returned, and the Vessels on it
would only have been sensiblc at most but of a Current or Running of the
Water to or from the place sinking or rising, somewhat like the effect that
happened at <HI>Nevis;</HI> which doth plainly shew, that, besides the suddain
Strokes or Concussions, there was also a considerable rising aud sinking of the
whole Island as to the level of the Sea. But that which I principally note un∣der
this Head is, that a good part of the said Island tumbled down and was
sunk into the Sea, which gives an account how many parts of the Earth
come to be buried under Ground and displaced from their former Situations,
and thence how Ships, Ankers, Bones, Teeth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that have sometimes been
digged up from great depths, may have come to be there buried.</P>
<P>Seventhly, 'Tis remarkable also, that this Eruption sent up into the Air
great Clouds of Dust and Smoke, which for the most part must soon fall down
again into the Sea, or contiguous parts of the Island. This will give a pro∣bable
account how the Layers of the Superficial Parts of the Earth may come
to be made; for the bigger part of this Dust must come down to the bottom
first and settle to a certain thickness and make a Bed of Gravel, then will
follow Beds of coarse Sand, then Beds of finer and finer Sand, and last of
Clays or Moulds of several sorts; again much of that which fell upon the
<PB N="421" REF="400"/>
higher parts of the Island, will, by the Rivers, be washed down into the
Vales, and there produce the like Beds or Layers of several kinds, and so
bury many of the parts that were before on the Surface. Thus Plants and
Vegetable Substances may come to be buried, and the Bones and Teeth of the
Carcasses of Dead Animals: These may also sometimes be buried under Beds
or Crusts of Stone, when the parts that thus make the Layers chance to be
mixed with such Subterraneous Substances as carry with them a petrifying
Quality. But I shall not detain you any longer with farther Deductions from
these few Remarks we find in these two casual Relations of this Earthquake;
I shall only add, that I could heartily with that some care were taken that a
more particular account might be procured of it whilst the effects thereof are
fresh in Memory, that they might be Recorded and added to the Collections
of Natural History. And for the same end it were desireable to know what
former. Earthquakes have been taken notice of in these, or any other of these
Islands, as <HI>Jamaica, Cuba, Hispaniola, Porto Rico,</HI> &amp;c. for that the Memory
of such Accidents, if they be not Collected and Recorded whilst the Specta∣tors
are in being, are soon forgotten and lost or not regarded by the suc∣ceding
Generations, as <HI>Aristotle</HI> has taken notice of also in the Chapter I be∣fore
quoted.</P>
<P>What is most remarkable in these Earthquakes in the <HI>Leeward</HI> Islands, is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why Island &amp; Sea-Co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sts are most subject to Earthquakes.</NOTE>
that they have all happened to places not far distant from the Sea, or even
under the Sea itself, though the Eruptions have been, for the most part on
the Land. So that there doth seem to be somewhat of Reason to Conjecture
as <HI>Signior Bottoni</HI> in his <HI>Pyrologia Topographica,</HI> that the saline Quality of the
Sea-water may conduce to the producing of the Subterraneous Fermentation
with the Sulphureous Minerals there placed, which the Experiment lately here
exhibited at a Meeting of this Society, does yet make more probable; for
by that it was evident, that the mixing of Spirit of Salt with Iron, did pro∣duce
such a Fermentation as did produce a Vapour or Steem, which by an
actual Flame was immediately fired like Gun-pouder, and if inclosed, would,
in all probability, have had a like effect of raising and dispersing of those
parts that bounded and imprisoned it. Now, 'tis evident that the melted
Matter which was vomited out of <HI>Aetna</HI> the Year sixty nine (of which we
have a part now in the Repository) was very much like to melted or cast Iron,
and I doubt not but that there may be much of that mineral in it; besides,
the Foot of the of that Mountain does extend even to the very sea, and in all pro∣bability
may have Caverns under the Sea itself, which is argued also from the Concurrency of the Conflagration of <HI>Strombolo</HI> and <HI>Lipary,</HI> Islands considerably di∣stant
from it by Sea, at the same time, where it is generally believed that
there may be Subterraneous Cavernous Passages between them, by which they
communicate to one another; so that sometimes it begins in <HI>Aetna,</HI> and is
communicated to <HI>Strombolo,</HI> and reciprocally communicated to <HI>Mongibel.</HI></P>
<P>This possibly may afford a probable Reason why Islands are now more sub∣ject
to Earthquakes than Continents and inland Parts; and indeed how so
many Islands came to be dispersed up and down in the Sea, namely, for that
these Fermentations may have been caused in the parts of the Earth subja∣cent
to the Sea, which being brought a Head of Ripeness, may have ta∣ken
Fire, and so have had force enough to raise a sufficient quantity of the
Earth above it, to make its way through the Sea, and there make itself a
vent, as the of that <HI>Canaries</HI> did in the Year 39, which, if sufficiently copi∣ous,
may produce an Island as that did also for a time, though it hath since
that time again sunk under the Surface of the Sea. But the Island<SEG REND="decorInit">o</SEG>f <HI>Ascen∣sion;</HI>
which, by all appearances, doth seem to have been the same way pro∣duced,
doth still remain as a witness to prove this Hypothesis. A like Testi∣mony
to this, of the Cause and Manner of their Production, I take the Island
and Pike of <HI>Tenariff</HI> to be, so <HI>Hecla</HI> of <HI>Iceland,</HI> so <HI>Bearenberg of John Mayens</HI>
or <HI>Trinity Island,</HI> so <HI>del Fuego</HI> of the Icelnd, of <HI>Cape Verd,</HI> so <HI>Ternate</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the
<HI>Moluccas,</HI> and the Island of <HI>Mascarenas,</HI> of the Islands about <HI>Madagas∣car</HI>
among the <HI>Antillas on Caribes,</HI> all which do seem to me to be remaining
Testimonies how, and in what manner, and by what means those other Islands
which have now worn out the marks of their first Origination, were at first
<PB N="422" REF="401"/>
produced. And tho' the Fires be extinct in many of the other Islands, yet
tis observable, that the prodigious high Mountains or Sugar-lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Pikes or
Hills do yet remain as marks of what they had been heretofore; so the Pike
of <HI>Fayal.</HI> among the <HI>Terceras,</HI> and the whole Island of St. <HI>Helena,</HI> and several
others of those about <HI>Madagascar</HI> and of the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> and of those of the
<HI>Antilles,</HI> and that of St. <HI>Martha</HI> mentioned by <HI>Dampire,</HI> do seem to me to be
plain evidences of the former and Original Causes of them all.</P>
<P>Nor do I in the least doubt but that an inquisitive Person who should pur∣posely
survey all other Islands that wanted these Marks or Tokens of such
Eruptions, might find enough of other Indications to manifest by what means
they so came to be placed in the Sea, so far from any part of the Continents
they are opposite to. Nor do I conceive they were all thus formed at once,
but rather successively, some in one, some in other Ages of the World, which
may probably be in some measure collected from the quantity or thickness of
the Soil or Mould upon them fit for Vegetation; whence the Island of <HI>Ascen∣sion</HI>
may be rationally concluded to have been a Production of not many Ages,
and the <HI>Bermoodas</HI> also of not very many more, because of the thinness of
such a Soil. So also the Island of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and some others, whose
Mould is yet but thin in respect of what it is in some others, and especially
in those of greater Magnitude and in the greater Continents.</P>
<P>Hereupon possibly it may be inquired why those greater isands and Con∣tinents'
should be of greater Antiquity than the smaller Islands. To which I
answer, that in the first▪ Ages of the World there were much greater Maga∣zines,
or Stores of the Materials fitted for this purpose, which being first
kindled threw up from under the Sea, with which they were covered, vast
quantities of it all at once, and thereupon those Magazines became in a manner
exhausted, yet not so totally as not to leave some smaller parcells of those
Substances so disposed, as not to be ready for inkindling together with those
greater; besides there remained other smaller parcels of it disposed and
placed in other parts of the Globe sufficiently distant from them, not to be
affected or inkindled at the same time, as those I have mentioned to have
been the causes of the Islands far distant from the Continents. Nor do I con∣ceive
that all those Clusters were all thrown up at once, as the <HI>Greecian</HI> Islands
in the <HI>Archipelago</HI> the <HI>East-Indian</HI> in that part called the <HI>South-sea,</HI> the <HI>Maldi∣via
Islands</HI> near the Coast of <HI>Malabar,</HI> the Islands scattered at the North of <HI>Ma∣dagascar,</HI>
the Islands to the South-west of St. <HI>Helena</HI> in the
<HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean,
<HI>Finidada dos picos,</HI> the Isles of <HI>Cape <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erd, Canaries, Tercer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, Orcades,</HI> &amp;c.
also the <HI>Gallopegas</HI> and others in the <HI>Pacifick</HI> sea or <HI>Mar del Zur;</HI> but rather
that some were made in one Age, some in other Ages of the World. And
this was timed as the several Magazines came to be ripened and then fired;
they only indicating, as I conceive, that in those places of the Terrestrial
Globe, there were placed the proper min<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ral Fomen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s or Seeds as it were of
them, which, when the convenient times were come and accomplished, then
they were put into Act, and then they produced their Effects, which are the
Islands that now remain the lasting Monuments of them. Nor can I suppose
that all the Magazines of the Earth of this kind are blown up and spent, but
that there may be many other yet remaining for future Ages▪ to be made sen∣sible
of their Effects. Nor can I be fully satisfied that all the main Conti∣nents
were thrown up or made Land all at once. Nor have we any proof
that the Continent of <HI>America</HI> was in the time of <HI>Noab's</HI> Flood, nor indeed
how large the habitable World then was, but certain we are, that what was
then in being was all overflowed and drowned by it, and all living Creatures,
except those preserved in the Ark with <HI>Noah,</HI> perished by it. But whether
the dry Land that appeared after the Flood, were the same with that before
the Flood, is a question not easily determinable▪ to me it seems that the pre∣ceding
Earth was wholly changed and destroyed, and that there was
Pro∣duced
a new Earth, which before that had not appeared; and this Doctrine
seems to be indicated by that Text in <HI>Genesis</HI> v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 13. <HI>And God said unto</HI> Noah,
<HI>the end of all Flesh is come before me; for the Earth is filled with violence through
them, and behold I will destroy them with the Earth.</HI> And again <HI>Chap. viii. 21.
I will not again curse the ground any more for Man's sake.</HI> And 2 Pet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. iii 5. <HI>By
<PB N="423" REF="402"/>
the word of God the Heavens were of old, and the Earth standing in the Water and
out of the Water.</HI> (ver. 6.) <HI>Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with
Water, perished.</HI> But the clearing this Doctrine by the Expressions in Scrip∣ture
I shall leave to the Divines; nor shall I in the least interfere with them:
However, it seems to me, that the Expression of <HI>Breaking up the Fountains of
the great Deep,</HI> might signify the raising up of the bottom of the Sea; and the
<HI>Water prevailing so as to cover the top of the highest Mountains,</HI> might denote to
us the sinking or subsiding of the former part of the dry Ground: So as <HI>the
former was wholly drowned and destroyed,</HI> which was <HI>Cursed for Man's sake,</HI> so a
new one was raised, which God promised should not be <HI>Cursed for Man's sake,</HI> as
the former had been; but this only by the bye. Certain I am that I have ne∣ver
yet met with my self, or heard of any other that hath any Records of the
Age of <HI>America,</HI> which, for any thing appears, may have been much younger
than the Flood of <HI>Noah:</HI> Nay, I believe it will be pretty difficult to prove e∣ven
these Islands of <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> to have been in being ever
since that Flood, and much more that there were such before it. And tho'
some may Conjecture that they have been so (which is the most that any one
can do) yet others may Conjecture that they have not (which is every deal as
valid). The same may be said of a very great part of the Earth, without
any trespassing upon our Faith or Religion; nay, it was we know, not long
since, that a Bishop was condemned of Heresy because he asserted Antipodes.
So skillful were some of our Fore-fathers in the Geography of the Habitable
Parts of the World, or of the Figure of the Earth; and I do very much
question, whether any Inhabitant of <HI>Europe, Asia,</HI> or <HI>Africa</HI> had ever any know∣ledge
of <HI>America,</HI> till within these last three hundred Years. But my present
subject is not so properly to search and inquire into the History, as to find out
what have been the Natural or Physical Causes of their Productions, Situa∣tions
and Forms, and that, I think, I have shewn to have been in probabili∣ty
some preceding Earthquakes, which Earthquakes may have been, caused
by Subterraneous Fermentations<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Accensions.</P>
<P>But some perhaps may except against this Doctrine as supposing it Deroga∣tory
to Divine Providence to assert any other Cause but the immediate Hand
of God. To which I Answer, That 'tis not denying of Providence to in∣quire
into, or to assign the Proximate Causes of Phaenomena in Physical Sub∣jects.
For that we have Instances in the sacred Scriptures of such Explica∣tions,
as in the case of the <HI>Israelites</HI> through the Red Sea; where 'tis said,
<HI>The Lord caused an East Wind to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which made the Sea to go back and to leave
the bottom dry Ground.</HI> And at the Waters of <HI>Marah</HI> God shewed <HI>Moses</HI> a
Tree, which, when he had cast into the Waters, the Waters were made
sweet. So in the Description of the Deluge, we find that God caused it<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to
Rain forty Days and forty Nights, and the Foundations of the great Deep
to be broken up, and the Windows of Heaven to be opened; which denote
by what Natural Means God was pleased to effect and Collect the great quan∣tity
of Water that was to drown and overflow the then Habitable Earth;
and many other such Instances there are to be met with in Holy Writ, where
the Physical Causes are explained, for it is the same Omnipotent Power
which does influence the remote Causes as well as the proximate; and the
universal Providence that ordereth all the effects, doth also determine and
appoint all the Causes and Means conducing thereunto; nor is there a neces∣sity
of supposing new created Causes for all the effects that we are ignorant
how they are brought to pass, or to believe every thing effected supernatur∣ally,
of which we cannot find out the Natural Cause; the Divine Providence
is not less Conspicuous in every Production that we call Natural, and think
we know the Causes of it, than in those we are less skillful and knowing in:
'Tis the Contemplation of the wonderful Order, Law and Power of that, we
call Nature, that does most magnify the Beauty and Excellency of the Divine
Providence, which has so disposed, ordered, adapted and impowered each
part so to operate, as to produce the wonderful Effects which we see;
I say wonderful, because every natural Production may be truly said to be a Won∣der
or Miracle, if duly considered; for who can tell the Cause of the
Growth, Form, Figure, and all the Qualifications and peculiar Proprieties
<PB N="424" REF="403"/>
of each▪ or any one Vegetable or Animal Species or individual? An obser∣ving▪
Naturalist may perhaps tell the Steps or Degrees he has taken notice of
in its Progress from the Seed to the Seed: Again, how he has observed the
Seed to s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rout, how that Sprout increaseth and forms itself of this or that
Magnitude; Shape, Colour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and how it produceth such a Flower, and
after that Flower such other<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Seeds as that from which it sprung: He may also
tell the Times and Seasons in which these Progresses have been or will be per∣formed;
but if it be inquired how the Progresses come to be acted, what is
the moving Power, or what is the inlivening Principle that orders, disposes,
governs and performs all these wonderful Effects, there he finds the <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
plus ultra▪</HI> there is the Miracle that he may truly admire but cannot under∣stand;
however, <HI>Est aliquid prodire tenus si non datur ultra,</HI> let us first find the
proximate Causes, and then proceed to the more remote; I think no one
ought to be blamed or discouraged from searching after these Causes and Rea∣sons
of Natural Productions so far as the Powers he is endowed with will en∣able
him; for this will more powerfully convince him of a Divine Providence
that Rules and Regulates the things of this World, than all the other me∣thods
of Contemplation or Argumentation whatsoever.</P>

<HEAD><DATE>July 30. 1699.</DATE> A Discourse of the Causes of Earthq<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>akes.</HEAD>
<P>I mentioned in some Lectures that the Earth did seem to grow old and to
have lost many of those Parts, which, in the younger times of the World, it
seemed to me to have more abounded with; that which I instanced in, was
the Foment or Materials that serve to produce and effect▪ Conflagrations, E∣ruptions,
or Earthquakes. These Materials I conceive to be somewhat an∣alogous
to the Materials of Gun-pouder, not that they must be necessarily the
very same, either as to the Parts or as to the Manner and Order of Compo∣sition,
or as to the way of Inkindling and Accension; for that as much the
same Effect may be produced by differing Agents, so the Methods and Order
of proceeding may be altogether as differing: A clear Instance of this we may
find in the phaenomena of Lightning, wherein we may observe, that the Effects
are very like to the Effects of Gun-pouder.</P>
<P>For we have first the flash of Light,<NOTE PLACE="marg">of Lightning and Thunder.</NOTE> which is very suddain, very bright,
and of very short continuance, being almost momentan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous, at least every
single flash is so, tho' the kindling of several parts at some distance from one
another does sometimes continue a succession or longer duration of the
Light.</P>
<P>Next we may observe the violence of the Crack or Noise which is likewise
as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omentaneous as the Fire, if it be single, but if there be many particular
flashes that contribute to this effect, and those made at several distances, then
the duration of the Thunder heard is longer than the duration of the flashes
of Lightning, which proceeds, as I conceive, from two Causes; First, For
that those flashes that are farther distant, have their Thunder a longer time
in passing to the Ear, than those which are nearer, by reason, that tho' the
Passage or Motion of Light be almost instantaneous, vet the progression or
motion of sound is temporaneous, and requires a certain sensible time to
pass a sensible s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace, and the times are proportionably longer as the spaces
passed are greate. But a second Cause of the duration of the Thunder, I
conceive, proceeds from Echoes that are rebounded both from parts of the
Earth, and likewise parts of the Air, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as from charged Clouds; of both
which I am sensibly assured both by natural Reasoning and from sensible Ob∣servations,
and I have observed much the same Effects produced by the Echoe∣ing
and Rebounding of the sound of a peice or Ordnance, from places at
several distances adapted for the production of such Repercussions.</P>
<P>But, Thirdly, We have also the Power and Violence of the force of the
Fire and Expansion, in fireing several things that are Combustible, in sud∣denly
melting of Metals and other Materials, which are difficult and flow
enough otherwise to be made to flow, in rending, ta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng, throwing down and
destroying whatever stands in its way, and the like; and yet after all, that
<PB N="425" REF="404"/>
which causeth these and many other strange Effects resembling those of Gun-pouder,
seems to be nothing but a Vapour or Steem mixed with the Body of
the Air, which is inkindled, not by any actual Fire, but by a kind of Fer∣mentation
or inward working of the said Vapour. Again, we find that the
<HI>Pulvis Fulminans</HI> as 'tis called, which hath some of its materials differing from
that of common Pouder; as also <HI>Aurum Fulminans,</HI> which is yet more differ∣ing
both as to its materials and as to its way of kindling, have yet most of
the same effects with Gun-pouder, both as to the flashing and thund<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring Noise,
and as to the Force or Violence. So that as these are differing in many par∣ticulars,
and yet produce much the same effects; so 'tis probable, that what
is the cause of Earthquakes and Subterraneous Thundring, Lightning and vi∣olent
Expansion, as I may so call those Phaenomena observable in those <HI>Crises</HI>
of Nature, may be in divers particulars differing from every one of these,
both as to the materials, and as to the form and manner of Accension, and
yet as to the Effects they may be very Analogous and Similar. So that tho'
I cannot possibly prove what the materials are, yet the Effects speak them to
be somewhat Analogous to those of Gun-pouder, or <HI>Pulvis Fulminans, Aurum
Fulminans</HI> or Lightning, which, tho' they seem very differing in many parti∣culars,
yet when I come to shew the Causes and Reasons of those Effects, I
shall manifest, that 'tis but one Operation in Nature, and that which causes
the effect in one causes the effect in all the rest, and the outward appearances
of the differing materials, and the differing way of Operating, are nothing
but the Habits, and Dresses, and Vizards of the Actors, and the differing
Modes and Dances by which they Act their several Parts, which, when they
have done, they are at an end, and have exerted their whole Power, and
there must be a new set of Actors to do the same thing again; the Oil of the
Lamp will be turned all into Flame, but you must have fresh Oil, if you will
have the Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me continued. So the Materials that make the Subterraneous
Flame or Fire, or Expansion, call it by which name you please, is consumed
and converted to another Substance, not fit to produce any more the same
Effect; and if the Confiagration be so great as to consume▪ all the present
Store, you might safely conclude that place would no more be troubled with
such Effects;<NOTE PLACE="marg">All things are in a perpetual charg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> but if there be remainders left, either already fit and prepared,
but shelteredd from Accension by other interposing incombustible Materials;
Or that there be other parts not thoroughly Ripe, and sufficiently prepared
for such Accension, then a concurrence of after Causes may repeat the same
Effects, and that <HI>toties quoties</HI> till all the Mine be exhausted, which I look up∣on
as a thing not only possible, but probable, nay, necessary, for that I find
it to be the general method of Nature, which is always going forward, and
continually making a progress of changing all things from the State in which
it finds them in at the present; all things as they proceed to their Perfection,
so they proceed also to their Dissolution and Corruption, as to their preced∣ing
Estate; and where Nature repeats the process, 'tis always on a new In∣dividual.</P>
<P>Now, tho' it may be Objected, of the material that produceth Lightn∣ing,
tho' it seemeth to be all kindled and so burnt off by the flash, yet we
find that after some time the same is again renewed, and so from time to
time, and therefore as one Operation doth destroy and consume it, so ano∣ther
doth generate and produce it anew, and therefore it doth seem pro∣bable
that the same may be done in the Subterraneous Regions, and thence,
tho' there were many Accensions and Consumings of the foment of Earth∣quakes
in former Ages, yet if Nature did thus again repair it, there would
be little reason to suppose, that former Earthquakes should be greater than
those which have in later, or in this present Age, been observed; to which
I Answer, That tho' it seem plain, that the foment of Lightning is renewed,
yet I conceive that to be only by new Emanations from the proper Minerals
in the Body of the Earth, and not for that the same Substance which is burnt
off in the Lightning, is again restored into its former State and made fit for
a second Accension, for tho' there may be necessary a praevious Digestion of
the Steams, which is performed by the Air and heat of the
Weather, yet that
does only prepare it with a proper fitness, but it must be some proper Mine∣ral
<PB N="426" REF="405"/>
that must furnish the Materials: And the same thing is more evident in
<HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lcanoes</HI> and burning Mountains, which are there only oberved to break
forth and burn where there is plenty of Brimstone and other proper Sub∣stances
for such Conflagrations; for if the same were only a continual new
Generation of Combustible Materials for the Fire, then I see no Reason why
those <HI>Incendiums</HI> should not be equally frequent and equally great in all places,
as well as in those where they are now frequently observed; for why should
it not as frequently happen in our Hills and Mountains, as it does in <HI>Sicily,</HI>
or <HI>Island,</HI> in <HI>Aetna,</HI> or <HI>Hecla,</HI> the one being as much colder then we, as we
are then the other? It follows therefore, that it must be caussed, not by the
Renovation of the Foment, but from the Duration of the Mines or Mine∣rals
that supply fit Materials, and consequently, that when those shall be quite
consumed, then, and not 'till then will the Fire go quite out. Nay that there
are some such Instances of preceding <HI>Vulcanoes,</HI> which have heretofore burn∣ed
and are now almost quite spent, may be concluded from the <HI>Pike of Tena∣riff,</HI>
which, by all Circumstances, seems to have been formerly a burning
Mountain, but is now quite extinct, and the Island of <HI>Ascension</HI> seems to be
another such an Instance. All which Conflagrations are the several Symp∣toms
of the progress of Nature in the determined Course and Method,
which, tho' it be differing from that of Life or Vegetation in lesser Bodies,
yet it may be possibly as Natural and Necessary in the greater.</P>
<P>I cannot therefore see any Absurdity in thinking or asserting that this Globe
of the Earth on which we inhabit is in a state of Progression from one degree
of Perfection to that of an other degree, which may be termed of Perfection,
for as much as it is the Progress and Operation of Nature; and at the same
time it may be conceived in a progress to Corruption and Dissolut<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on in as
much as it continually changed from its preceding State, and acquires a new
and differing one from what it had before, which new Estate may be upon
some accounts considered as more perfect, tho' upon other accounts it may be
accounted corrupting and tending to its final Dissolution; and as 'tis certain
that it is continually older in respect of Time and Duration, so I conceive al∣so
that it grows older as to its Constitution and Powers, and that there have
been many more Effects produced by it in its more Juvenile Estate, than it doth
or it can now produce in its more Senile, as more particularly to Earthquakes
and Eruptions; for to me it seems most evident and past doubting, that
there have been in some preceding Ages of the World Eruptions and Confla∣grations
which have infinitely surpassed any that have happened of later Years,
or indeed any that we have any certain account of in History. Some kind
of Memory of some antient Traditions concerning a very great one that
sometimes happened, seems to be preserved by the Poetical or Mythological
History of <HI>Phaeton,</HI> of which <HI>Plato</HI> also tells us, that the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> had a
more perfect knowledge and account, than ever the <HI>Greeks</HI> were Masters of,
who, at best, as to Histories of preceding Ages, were by the <HI>Aegyptian</HI>
Priests, accounted but Boys and Children; however, <HI>Ovid,</HI> by his wording of
that Fable, does seem plainly to have had some knowledge of what was mean<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
or understood thereby; and tho' he seems to ascribe the Cause thereof to
some extraordinary heat of the Sun, yet that might be nothing else but the
relating the Opinion of the Antients preserved by the same Tradition, by
which the Memory of the Prodigious effects that had been wrought had been
retained.</P>
<P>In which case we are to distinguish between Histories of Matters of
Fact, and those of Opinion; and <HI>Plato</HI> takes notice of as much when he men∣tions
of Relation. The Matters of Fact seem to have been the Conflagra∣tion
of many parts of Earth at once, and those the most eminent, such
as the Mountains, which, whether they were in being before the Conflagra∣tion,
or made by that Eruption, does not appear by the Story, but it seems
most probable, that that was the time of their Production; and the calling of
them by several Names, yet retained, does signify no more, but that those
Mountains, which are now called so or so, were then on Fire and burning.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="406"/>
But having before explain'd this Fable of <HI>Phaeton,</HI> and several others of
that ingenious Mythologick Poet <HI>Ovid,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Earthquakes formerly more frequent, and why.</NOTE> I shall for bear the repetition o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them
here, and for the present would only infer, that in former and younger Ages
of the World those kind of effects, produced by Eruptions and Earthquakes,
have been much more considerable than those which are now produced, or
which have been produc'd since we have had any Records kept of such Events;
and therefore we are not to conclude that such huge Mountains, as the <HI>Alpes,</HI>
the <HI>Andes, Caucasus, Atlas,</HI> or the like, could never be produced by means
of Earthquakes or Eruptions, because we do not now find Instances of Effects
of the same Grandure produced in our present Age, or in the Ages of which
we have some more perfect account; for that in the former Ages there have
been a much greater plenty of those kinds of Minerals which have been con∣sumed,
and for that the Relicts which are now left are but very small, and
in probability not so apt for Conflagration, nor so strong and efficacious in
their Operations; besides many of their Substances that were left may have
since been petrify'd and converted into Substances, wholly unfit for the Fo∣ment
or Fuell of such kinds of Fire; for that such Mutations have been ef∣fected
by length of Time, I think no one that has observ'd and consider'd the
Nature of Petrifaction can at all doubt, any more than he can whether there
be any such Substance as Stone; for that all Places and Quarries especially
will furnish him with Evidences enough to convince any that will not be wil∣fully
ignorant.</P>
<P>This effect of Petrifaction is a Symptom of old Age; for as plenty of <HI>Spiri∣tuous,
Unctuous</HI> and Combustible or Inflammable Juices and Moisture is a sign of
Youth: So the want of them, and of the Effects produced by them, is a sign
of old Age, in which those unctuous Juices are consumed and the Spirituous
Fluids wasted, and the Parts become dry, and hard, and Stiff, and unactive;
neither fit to inkindle the active Flame or to maintain it; neither fit to make
other Substances fluid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earth grows old and less f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tful.</NOTE> nor to be made fluid themselves; which Fuidity is an
inseparable Concomitant of that we call Spirituous Substances: And 'tis the
plenty of those kind of Substances that maketh the Youthful Ages both of
Plants and Animals to flourish, and the Consumption and want of them, that
makes both Plants and Animals to decay and grow old, as we call them, to
grow stiff, and dry, and rough, and shrivelled; all which Marks or Sy∣pmtoms
may plainly be discovered also in the Body of the Earth, and I am apt
to believe would be very much more if we could be truly inform'd of the for∣mer
and younger Condition thereof; for I have very good Reason to believe,
that there has been times of the Earth wherein it hath had a much smoother
and softer, and more succous Skin than now it hath, when it more abounded
with Spirituous Substances, when all its Powers were more strong and vegete,
and when those Scars, Roughness and Stiffness were not in being; and tho'
possibly some may think all these Conceptions to be groundless and merely
Conjectural, yet I may in good time manifest, that there are other ways of
coming to the discovery of many Truths than what have been to this purpose
hitherto made use of, which yet are not less capable of Proof and Confirma∣tion,
than Histories or Records are by Coins, Inscriptions or Monuments.
And tho' it may seem difficult to understand or be informed of the State of
the subterraneous and inaccessible Regions, and of the Ages before History,
yet I do not look upon either as an impossibility, no, nor as insuperable by
the Industry of a few, nay, of a single Person. And possibly I may some o∣ther
time shew divers other ways of Inquiry, and other Methods of Demon∣stration
of Causes than what have been yet applied to those purposes.</P>
<P>Nor is this Assertion of the growing old of the Earth to be looked on as so
great a Paradox, or as Heterodoxical, or Scismatical, for we find in Scripture
that the Kingly Prophet <HI>David</HI> in the 102 <HI>Psalm</HI> has an Expression that doth
plainly assert it, not only of the Earth but even of the Heaven. <HI>Of old hast
thou laid the foundations of the Earth, and the Heavens are the works of t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y hands,
they shall perish, but thou shalt indure; yea all of them shall wax old like a garment,
as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed.</HI> Which Expression is almost verbatim repeated by the Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> Chap. 51. v. 6. <HI>Lift up
your eyes to the heavens and look upon the earth beneath, for the heavens shall vanish
<PB N="428" REF="407"/>
away like Smoke, and the Earth shall wax old like a Garment.</HI> Nay, this Expres∣sion
of the <HI>Psalmist</HI> is verbatim repeated by St. <HI>Paul</HI> in the 10. 11 and 12.
Verses of the Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews.</HI> By all which it is evident at least, that
<HI>David, Isaiah</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI> were all of that belief. I could produce many Ex∣pressions
to the like purpose both in Sacred and Prophane Histories, both of
Christian and Heathen Writers, but those I have quoted I suppose may be
sufficient to answer Objectors of that kind.</P>
<P>As for any other objections that may be brought against this Doctrine,
such as the equal Stature and Ages of Men for so long time as we have had
any History; from the want of Histories of such Juvenil Estates, from the
Permanency and Duration of all the Species of Plants and Animals in the
same Estate, from the Incorruptibity of the Heavens and Caelestial Bodies,
and so of their Influences, Causations, and many other of the like Nature; I
doubt not to be able to give a satisfactory Answer if any of them shall be
pressed or insisted upon, tho' at the same time I cannot hope that all will be
convinced, much less, that all will confess themselves to be so, tho' really they
are. All I can say, is <HI>Valeat quantum valere potest,</HI> let every one enjoy his
own freedom.</P>

<P>The Aim of my present Discourse is rather a Progression in the The∣ory
of the Nature of the Air, than of any of the formerly mention'd
Effects of Earthquakes, and the rather by the way of Query and Inquisiti∣on,
than of possitive Theory and Affirmation.</P>
<P>As First, Whether the late Feaverish Distemper that was here so fre∣quent,
supposed by some to be inclined to Pestilential, tho' not so Mortal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">of the Constitution of the Air after Earthquakes.</NOTE>
might not be caused by some Infections or Poisenous Vapours cast into it by
those late Eruptions in <HI>Italy</HI> or <HI>America?</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Whether the coldness, unseasonableness of the Spring, the strange
Rains, Storms and Tempests, and other such unusual Accidents, that have
lately happened in the Weather, may not have been caused by the same Ef∣ficients
that caused the Eruptions?</P>
<P>Thirdly, Whether it may be reasonable to conceive, that there could be a∣ny
Communication Subterraneous between these places of those Eruptions in
<HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Lima;</HI> or whether it were Superterraneous through the Air and
Aether?</P>
<P>Fourthly, Whether it may be rationally conceived, that Steems raised in∣to
the Body of the Air in <HI>Lima</HI> or in <HI>Naples</HI> could be continued so long in it
as to be conveyed from either of those places to <HI>England, London,</HI> &amp;c.?</P>
<P>Fifthly, How long time may be judged necessary for such a Conveyance?</P>
<P>Sixthly, Whether such Distempers of the Air may be precedent to the
Distempers within the Earth, and so be of the Nature of a Procatarctick cause
of the Earthquakes, and if so, whether those Distempers may arise from the
Nature of the Air itself, or form some external and influential Cause, ei∣ther
from the Aether, Comets, or some of the more Conspicuous Caelestial
Bodies?</P>
<P>Seventhly, Whether there may be not some general, tho' yet unknown,
Cause, that may produce both those effects in the Earth and those in the Air,
nay, and those in the Aether also, such as Comets and some kinds of Meteors
also? because of the usual Concomitance of them; as will in part appear by
subsequent Relations.</P>
<P><PB N="429" REF="408"/>
These possibly may be looked upon as not very easily solvable, and there∣fore
not so proper to be propounded as Queries, unless they could also be
as satisfactoraly answered. I must leave every one to Censure as he thinks
meet, only this I must add, that the first step towards Knowledge is Inqui∣sition.</P>
<P>And that I may manifest that these Queries are not altogether at random,
I shall add some Natural Histories, that may possibly give some hints of their
Solution; and those shall be the Accounts of some Accidents or Effects similar
to those, which have lately happened at other Times, and in other Places;
from whose Congruities one would be apt to conjecture a similitude of Causes,
and if not a necessary, yet somewhat more than an accidental Concurrency
of Effects, and a kind of Periodick Revolution of them.</P>
<P>In the Year 1672, in the Islands of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> that is, the Islands of
<HI>Greece,</HI> this Winter was so Stormy and Tempestuous, that not only the Trees
and Plantations, but the Houses also were destroyed by the Lightning and
Hail; so that both the Towns and Villages became almost unknowable, being
reduced to Ruins.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> also was a most violent Hurricane, in which many of our
Nation Perished.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Ancona, Fauno</HI> and <HI>Rimini,</HI> there were this Year, in <HI>April,</HI> many
Houses overturned by an Earthquake; and more especially in <HI>Romania</HI> and St.
<HI>Marc,</HI> there were above six hundred People killed, and above quaruple
that number hurt: At <HI>Rimini</HI> the Cathedral Church was overthrowed, the
Bells shaken out of the Tower, and may People lost their Lives.
At <HI>Fauno</HI> twenty eight Persons were killed by the fall of a Bell. The churches of the
<HI>Theatines, St. Agnie, St. Apollonce, St. Mary de la Gomia, St. Innocent, St. Ber∣nard,
St. Mary della Colonolla,</HI> and all the others except only those of the <HI>Ca∣puchines,</HI>
and of <HI>Maria de Mari</HI> were endamaged. A great number of Palaces
and Houses were ruined: This happened whilst People were at Church; so
that above fifteen hundered were killed, and many more were hurt. At <HI>Pe∣saro</HI>
and <HI>Senegallo</HI> the Walls of the City and many Chimnies were thrown
down. <HI>Ancona</HI> and <HI>Rimini</HI> were abandoned by their Inhabitants, who were
constrained to lie under the open Canopy of Heaven.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> the 30th., of the same Year, there was a Hurricane passed trough
all <HI>Spain,</HI> but it was most furious about <HI>Madrid,</HI> insomuch that it blew down
the Roofs, Chimnies; nay, and the Houses too; as also the Towers and
Churches; insomuch that the Damage was exceeding great along the <HI>Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI>
and at <HI>Buon Retiro.</HI> But all this was nothing in comparison of what happened the
same Day in almost all the Countries of <HI>Spain;</HI> for this furious Tempest caused
such Ravages in <HI>Andalusia, Gallicia, Castal, Grenada, Valencia and Biscay,</HI> as were
truly Amazing: But what was most remarkable was this, that three Days
after the Gallions of the Plate-Fleet, which came from the <HI>West -Indies,</HI> being
arrived at the Islands of <HI>Terceras,</HI> felt not the least of it.</P>
<P>In this Year were also seen two Comets,—one in <HI>January</HI> another in <HI>April.</HI></P>
<P>Eight Years before this, namely in 1664, were two Comets also; but all
the other Natural Histories, or Physical Accidents of that Year I have not
yet procured.—</P>
<P>But eight Years after this, <HI>viz</HI> 1680, which is now also eight Years since;
First, For the Comets they are yet in most Mens Memories, and besides
there are Histories enough extant; but next for the Earthquakes: First, By
a Letter from <HI>Botavia</HI> we have an account of a great Earthquake that hap∣pened
in <HI>China</HI> about <HI>Peking</HI> the preceding <HI>August,</HI> viz. That the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <HI>August</HI>
79, about ten in the Morning, there happened a most terrible Earthquake,
which overturned almost all the Houses of that great City<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the parts there-about,
where by a World of People were destroyed in a most dreadful manner, be∣sides
multitudes that were hurt, whose number we cannot yet learn to this Hour:
Two Heads of certain Beasts, which were Carved and fixed over the Imperial
Palace Gate, were beaten off and thrown down to the Ground by the force
of the shake. All the palaces of the <HI>Mandarines</HI> and their Families, and the
Courts of Justice round the Palace were tumbled down; the Emperor com∣manded
the principle <HI>Mandarines,</HI> that had command over the five parts of
<PB N="430" REF="409"/>
the City of <HI>Peking,</HI> to examine themselves in their proper Persons, and to
give him an account of all the damages that had happened, that he might
the better advise of ways to help the Poor People that had suffered. This
they did, and advised, that if his Majesty would distribute to each two or
three Crowns of Silver at twenty five Frecks the Crown, it might be a suf∣ficient
supply: But he thinking this was too little, commanded ten Thou∣sand
Crowns to be taken out of his Treasury and distributed for the present
Necessity. The first, second and following Days that it lasted, the Earth
was shaken five, six, or seven times a Day, but not with so much violence as
by the first; so that the Inhabitants were in such Consternation as to for∣sake
their Houses; the Soldiers and their Wives were most afflicted having
nothing left to subsist; by Day they were exposed to the Sun, and by Night
to the cold Heaven, which much incommoded them. The Emperor also was
in great Pain to know the Damages that had happened in the Neighbouring
Parts by this Earthquake, and commanded one of his great <HI>Mandarines,</HI> nam∣ed
<HI>Samolio,</HI> to inquire and inform him of them, who returned this Report,
That the ½ 3/3 of <HI>August,</HI> whilst the Heaven was covered all over with dark
Clouds, the Earthquake shocked extraordinarily the City of <HI>Tongfu</HI> about a
Days Journey from <HI>Peking,</HI> that all the Imperial Magazines there had been
overturned, as likewise the old Walls of the City so that of ten Parts of
the City scarce on remained which had not been indamaged, whose pitiful
Condition was deplored by every one. The commissioners of the Magasines
Emperial who had escaped, render'd themselves presently to His Imperial
Majesty to give him an account of the flying of the under Officers for the
Consternation, and of their fear of the Robbing of the remaining Rice and
Provisions by Thieves, which caused him to send them sixteen Hundred Sol∣diers
for their Guard. The <HI>Primier Intendant</HI> of the Navy was killed by the
overturning of his House. The Emperor had also reported to him, how the
Robbers had wasted much of his Treasury in the Magazines that had been
overturned; and upon consideration of the general Calamity, the Em∣peror
makes a most Pious Speech to the principle <HI>Mandarines,</HI> which I shall
not trouble you with, only my Author adds, What Christian could have spoke
better? Will not such as he rise up in Judgment against many Christians?
This is a short Account of what happened to two Cities of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>a.</HI> I say Ci∣ties<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
For tho' generally we have only an account of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> caused to
Cities, Towns and Men, yet we are not to conceive, as if the shaking and
disorders of an Earthquake were only aimed at Cities like Marks and Goales
to be shot at; no, certainly, there may, in all such Concussions and Devastati∣ons
have happened much greater and different Effects from those which come
to our knowledge; for that the most part of the World have little concern
for what may happen in the Mountains, Hills, Plains, Forrests, Seas, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
which make not any great or publick Calamity to the more considerable sort
of Men; wherefore questionless, tho' many strange Effects of this kind may
also have happened, and may have been seen and observed by some Men, yet
they are but as it were <HI>In transitu,</HI> and quickly forgotten, since there is none
to Record them. So that many thousands of such Effects have been swallow∣ed
up by the Oblivion of Time, where one h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> chanced to get by some
accidental hint to lie Recorded by chance among the heap of other Histories.
Comets indeed, as glaring in every ones Eyes, have found, among the mul∣titude
of Observers, some that have Recorded somewhat of them to Posteri∣ty,
but even among them also, I doubt we shall not find that one of ten has
obtained a History. But this Earthquake in <HI>China</HI> was not the only Acci∣dent
of this time which I would mention; for upon the Coast of <HI>Coroman∣dal,</HI>
the Sea so overflowed the Country, that infinities of Men and Cattle
were destroyed, many Cities and Villages were drowned. This overflowing
was also found at <HI>Jasnapatnam,</HI> where it did much mischief to the Fortification, and to the Country, and the Cattle, but not so much to the Men.</P>
<P>Nor were these kind of Accidents only felt in <HI>India,</HI> but the same Year there happened a considerable Earthquake in <HI>Spain,</HI> and particularly at <HI>Ma∣laga.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="431" REF="410"/>
All <HI>Spain</HI> was this Year so perished with Drouth, that not only the Pits,
Fountains and Rivers were dried, but the Harvest was spoiled, and many
perish'd by this means: On the other side in the <HI>Autumn</HI> arose such horrible
Tempests and Earthquakes as were felt long after. After the beginning of
<HI>September</HI> they had continual Thunder and Lightning, by which divers perish∣ed.
The Hail fell so on <HI>Pardo,</HI> a Pleasure-house of the Kings of <HI>Spain,</HI> that
it rooted up the greatest Trees, and kill'd so many Beast and Foul, that not
only the Fields were almost cover'd, but the River <HI>Mancanarez;</HI> it much in∣damaged
the Village <HI>Foncarral;</HI> the Old Bridge <HI>de Aranda de Duerro</HI> was born
down by the Waters of the River <HI>Tagus,</HI> which run under, and did much da∣mage
to <HI>Ar anivez,</HI> sweeping away divers People, Cattle,
Trees, Bridges, and
Houses: The like Ruins were caused almost over all the Kingdom, insomuch
that in one Village, only, forty People were lost. The greatest violence was<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
at <HI>Madrid</HI> the twenty sixth of <HI>September,</HI> where the Water overflowed so as
to mount into the Garden of the <HI>Augustines</HI> and throw down the Wall; also
into the fair Parterres of the Countess <HI>Ognate,</HI> and run into her House, ruin'd
the rich Furniture of Pictures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the lower Story; ruin'd the Stables
and razed one House. The River also bore away fifty Foot of a strong Stone-Wall
made to stop the Passage into the River <HI>Prado:</HI> This River one of the
least in <HI>Spain,</HI> so swelled as to carry away almost all before it, as four Iron
Gates, and the Cross of the <HI>Via Sacra.</HI> It beat down the Bridge before <HI>Bu∣on
Retiro,</HI> and broke through the middle of the Stone Bank. It rush'd into
the Gardens of <HI>Nostre Dame de Arocha</HI> after it had beat down the Wall; it
run into the general Hospital carrying with it an Arch of Stones. The twen∣ty
seventh the overflowing continued with constant Thunder and Lightning,
when the River <HI>Mancanarez</HI> bore down the fair Bridge of <HI>Toledo</HI> of sixty Ar∣ches.
The twenty eighth the Streams of <HI>Prado</HI> so swelled by the Torrents
from the Mountains, that all the Champain near it was drowned, the King
and Queen of <HI>Spain</HI> were like to be lost in their return from <HI>Nostre Dame de
Arocha; Malaga,</HI> a City of the Kingdom of <HI>Granada,</HI> situated on the <HI>Medi∣terranean,</HI>
twenty five Miles from the Streights, a Place Great, Rich and well
Peopled, had, the ninth of this Month, such violent Shocks of an Earth∣quake,
that all were frighted, the Sea was so disturbed, that the Fish leaped
out of the Water, and the Ships in the Harbour were cast above twenty Foot
from their places, which the Mariners believed to be sunk; the Harbours
and Walls were sunk, together with the Bulwarks, Towers and Fortifications
of four Parishes, of which the City consisted, having, 4284 Houses, 1057
were ruined to their Foundations; 1259 so decay'd., that they must be Re∣built
to be Habitable. Divers Churches and Palaces Felt the effects also; five
Cloysters of Religious with the People were utterly ruined, and above all,
that of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> where Stone was not left on Stone, where fourteen Per∣sons
Perish'd, four Hospitals, one Colledge, the Bishops Palace, the Palaces
of <HI>A Diego de Argote, de Jo. de Torrez, de Diego de Cordua,</HI> and a fair House
joining to the Cathedral was thrown down, yet the Church which had been
Repai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing and Beautifying ever since 1521 scaped, tho' divers times shaken.
In the Suburbs <HI>Los Perchelez</HI> two hundred and twenty five Houses were thrown
down, so that in all 1282 Houses were destroy'd. Many Houses in the
Confines of <HI>Malaga</HI> were overturned; besides the Earth opened in divers
places and disgorged Waters in great abundance, which swelled the Rivers
and made them overflow. Many Houses in the Villages were destroyed, as
at <HI>Pizaria</HI> four Miles from <HI>Malaga,</HI> fifteen of twenty four Houses were
overturned; some Mountains were displaced, and divers Persons and Cattle
lost: The Wall of <HI>Alhaurin de la tor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> two Miles from <HI>Malaga,</HI> opened four
Foot, but closed again: The Jasper Columns of the Church were lifted up
and setled down again on their Pedestals. At <HI>Competa,</HI> six Leagues from the
City, nothing but the Tabernacle and the Cross of the Church remained
whole. At <HI>Aloizana</HI> forty Houses were tumbled down, as many at <HI>Cartama,</HI>
and thereabout also at <HI>Coin,</HI> and a great number of People perish'd.
At great <HI>Alhaurin</HI> two hundred and forty Houses and the Church were destroy'd,
of which only fifty three were somewhat Habitable. In the City of <HI>Minorz</HI>
five Leagues from <HI>Malaga,</HI> thirty seven Houses were tumbl'd down, and fif∣teen
<PB N="432" REF="411"/>
Persons crush'd. The Church at the City <HI>Binal-Madera</HI> fell on a heap,
and all the Houses render'd unhabitable. The Earth opened at <HI>Veles Malaga,</HI>
and so swelled a River, which run some space from thence, that it rose ten
Pikes above the tops of the Houses, which it squash'd in running. Many
Houses were ruin'd at <HI>Alorb,</HI> others much endamag'd, with the Cloister of
St. <HI>Francis.</HI> All the churches of <HI>Granada</HI> were shaken, and a Chappel in the
Church of <HI>Mercy</HI> ruin'd: All which were sad Spectacles.</P>
<P>I have given the Particulars of the whole Relation, most of which concern
Buildings, Men and Cattle, those being the Particulars most People are af∣fected
with and so observe, and you find only two hints, as it were, of o∣ther
Effects, the one is of the removing several Mountains, the other of the
Earths opening and disgorging a Flood. But 'tis not to be thought but that
an inquisitive Naturalist might have found ten times more remarkable. Ef∣fects
in the Country than the shaking down a few Houses in the Towns and
Villages, all which, if taken notice of, are soon forgot and lost, and so have
been in former Ages, and therefore no wonder if we hear nothing of them in
Books: But Nature itself has preserved somewhat of the memory of them
by the Medals or indelible Characters of Shells or other Petrify'd, or other-wise
preserved Substances, which any, that have Senses and Understanding,
may read. But this is not the aim of my present relating these Histories,
but to give an example of a Contemporariness of Earthquakes at great di∣stances
upon the Earth, and a similitude of Effects with those we have this
Year heard of from <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>America;</HI> nay, and let me add what we
have had in <HI>London</HI> and <HI>England, viz</HI> a kind of Agueish Distemper, yet not Pe∣stilential,
which, 'tis well known, has been very general; for I find that in
<HI>October</HI> Agues were as frequent this Year in <HI>France,</HI> as the late Cold or Di∣stemper
was here: It was then that Dr. <HI>Tabour</HI> cured the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI>
and many other Persons of great Quality, among the rest the <HI>Dauphiness</HI> first,
and afterwards the <HI>Dauphin</HI> himself, by a Medicine he had invented; tho'
<HI>Tabours</HI> demanding five Thousand Crowns for discovering his Receipt, made
the <HI>Dauphin</HI> first make use of other means, but without effect. (I will not
like an Astrologer name to you the Occurrences that then happened at <HI>Cologne,</HI>
nor make comparison with the present, but leave those to the Astrologians,
<HI>&amp;c</HI>). The Plague also this Year 1689, was very much at <HI>Prague,</HI> so that some
judged there died in that City thirty Thousand<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at <HI>Dresden</HI> above four Thou∣sand,
at <HI>Leipsick</HI> about three Thousand; I cannot say there hath ben a Comet
this Year, but I have been confidently told, that there appear'd one in the
Mornings about a Month since, but I could not have the luck to see it, tho'
I looked for it divers Mornings after I heard of it, but 'tis more likely it may
appear in <HI>October,</HI> or later; but that belongs to another Head, the Affected
Earth and Infected Air being those I designed at present to compare; and in
these we find the effects in <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Coromandel</HI> eight Years since to answer
those of <HI>America</HI> this present Year, and that then of <HI>Spain</HI> to this now of <HI>Ita∣ly;</HI>
and those then of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> to the late here in <HI>England,</HI> tho' in
all particulars those of the Year eighty seem to exceed those of the present
Year. But as the Relations of that are but short and imperfect, so are those
of the present as yet much more; but 'twere to be wish'd some more full
might be obtained and Recorded before they be forgotten, which a little
space of time will otherwise effect, and 'tis not to be doubted but we might
hear of much stranger effects of the <HI>Lima</HI> Earthquake, than yet have arrived,
if care were taken to procure a fuller account of them. And by the Yester∣days
<HI>Brussells</HI> we are informed of a Cleft in a Mountain belonging to the
<HI>Marquis de Tarracusa,</HI> of four Spans broad and two Miles long, of which
they can find no bottom, and of a Fire shot into the Heavens like a great
Beam, of which they lost the fight, not knowing whether it went.</P>
<P>But in the mean time possibly it may not seem altogether unreasonable to suppose, that such an Eruption may emit poisenous Vapours, as well as sometimes poisenous Waters; as appears by that of <HI>France</HI> which I have Printed in one of my Collections. Nor may it seem so strange to suppose its effect may operate at such distances, and not at the very place; when we consider how fiery and volatile such Steams may be, how violently shot into the Air,
<PB N="433" REF="412"/>
and blow far off the Dust and Ashes of Hecla, <HI>Aetna,</HI> the <HI>Palma,</HI> and many
others have been carried in the Air before they have fallen, of which Instances
may be produced. And that, in probability, the less active or dead Earthy-Materials
are those, which fall near the, place, whose Qualifications may be of
differing Natures. Nor will any very long time be thought requisite for their
transport to far distant Countries imbody'd in the Air, when I have proved
the velocities of its motions. Nor will it seem strange to one that shall well
consider the known Effects of the several Winds, to suppose such kind of trans∣ports:
But of these Particulars I shall say more upon some other occasion.</P>

<CLOSER><SIGNED>R. W.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>I Delivered in my last Lecture in this place, the Methods I had made use
of for the founding and establishing the Doctrines or Conclusions I had
made concerning the Causes and Reasons of the present State and Phaenomena
of the Surface of the Earth, which was by a methodical Induction from the Phaeno∣mena
themselves of the most remote, as well as the more approximate and im∣mediate
Causes thereof. But notwithstanding all the Arguments I have al∣ledged,
and the Proofs I have produced in the delivery of this <HI>Theory,</HI> I still
find that there remain upon the Minds of some such Doubts and contrary
Persuasions, that they cannot forsake their former Opinions; and therefore
(tho' I think I have already fully proved every part, so that the Confutations
of such Objections would be but the necessary Corollaries from the said Do∣ctrine,
yet since I find they are still insisted on as material Objections that
will need a more particular Discussion and Examination) I thought it not im∣pertinent
to examine them more strictly, to find the Power and Efficacy, or to
discover the Weakness and Insufficiency of them for the purpose they are de∣signed.
That thereby the <HI>Idola</HI> (as my Lord <HI>Verulam</HI> says) which pre-possess
the Minds of some Men, and molest: them in the discovery and imbracing
of Sciences may be detected, and, as much as may be, removed and dislolved,
thereby to leave the Mind more free to Discourse and Reason aright, with∣out
the prejudices of any unfound, unaccountable and unwarrantable Do∣ctrines
formerly imbrac'd.</P>
<P>The Objections I shall at present examine are only two, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>First, That if these large Petrified Bodies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Obj. 1st. As to a Species being lost</NOTE> such as the <HI>Ophiomorphite</HI> Stone
which I did formerly shew to this Society in the place, be supposed to have
been the Production of this Shell of a certain kind of <HI>Nautilus</HI> of that big∣ness
and shape, which, in preceding Ages of the World, had been produced
and perfected to that Magnitude in the bottom of the Sea, which then was
near the place where they are now found, as I have argued for; then it will
necessarily follow, say they, that there have been; in former times, certain
Species of Animals in Nature, which in succeeding and in the present Age
have been and are wholly lost; for neither have we in Authors any mention
made of such Creatures, nor are there any such found at present, either
near the places of their position (as on the Shores or Sea about this Island)
nor in any other part of the World for ought we yet know. Now, to suppose
such a Doctrine as doth necessarily infer such a Consequence, is looked upon by
such as absurd and extravagant; for that it would argue an imperfection of
the first Creation, which should produce any one Species more than what was
absolutely necessary to its present and future State, and so would be a great
derogation from the Wisdom and Power of the Omnipotent Creator.</P>
<P>To this first Objection I Answer, First, That tho' it may possibly be true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st. Answer.</NOTE> that there is at present no such <HI>Nautili</HI> to be found upon the Coast or Shores
<PB N="434" REF="413"/>
of the Lands where these forts of figured Stones are found, yet no one is as∣sured
that there are not some of the same Species, and as big in some other
parts of the World, as possibly at the bottoms of some of the great Oceans.
Of such Productions and those Multifarious both Vegetable and Animal, no
one can doubt that has found in soundable Depths such variety of testaceous
and crustaceous Animals there residing, as in their proper and Natural Regi∣ons;
which would by no means possibly be produced or kept alive in parts of
the Sea where they should want their natural Accommodations; one of which
may possibly be a sufficient degree of Pressure from the incumbent Column of
Water, which, if such be necessary to their Life and well Being, we are
no more to wonder that they should not be found in shallower Waters, than
that Men should not be found inhabiting the tops of the <HI>Andes,</HI> of the <HI>Atlas, Alps,</HI>
or <HI>Caucasus,</HI> which from the thinness and coldness of the Air at those heights,
are no ways fit for Respiration and sustaining Life. Now, that the present
Land of <HI>England</HI> may have in former Ages had some such Position with respect to
an incumbent Sea, I could produce several Arguments were they now mate∣rial
to the answering the present Objection, but I will not now insist upon it.</P>
<P>But in the second place I answer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d. <HI>Answer.</HI></NOTE> That tho' possibly there may be no such
<HI>Nautilus</HI> to be found described in any Natural Historian at this Day, yet 'tis
possible there may be many of the same Species, and of as great Magnitudes
in divers parts of the World, such as have been either not yet discovered by
the <HI>Europeans</HI> or but of late, or but little frequented; and so tho' they may
be there frequent and plentiful enough, yet none may have been brought
thence into <HI>Europe</HI> as yet, or possibly so much as seen there; 'tis not to be
doubted that there really are great multitudes of differing Species of Vege∣tables,
Insects, Beasts and Fishes yet in places less frequented, of which we
in <HI>Europe</HI> have hitherto had no knowledge or information; and tho' many
strange things have been of late Years brought to our view, yet we may with
Reason enough assert, there are many more yet latent, which Time may make
manifest: For if we consider the small knowledge of things of this Nature
that we yet have acquired, of places remote, even the most frequented, we
need not much wonder at the lesser information of such, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> are not known or
less frequented; for not to insist upon the multitude<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Vegetables that have
been newly shewn to us by the Authors of the <HI>Hort<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Malabaricus,</HI> and by
<HI>Brennius,</HI> and others, we are put in hope, to see the Descriptions of as many
more yet by the same Authors, from the same places which yet are but two
small spots in respect of the vast Spaces, and variety of Soils and Climates
yet unsurvey'd; and 'tis not to be doubted but that the Earth, and Air, and
much more yet, the Seas or several Countries and Climates would afford as
great varieties of Birds, Beasts, Insects and Fishes, if there were found know∣ing
and diligent searchers and describers of them: And that this is so, I shall
mention only one Instance, because 'tis pertinent to the present Subject, name∣ly,
that I have had a peculiar kind of <HI>Nautilus</HI> brought from the <HI>Caribys,</HI>
where they are in great plenty, and yet I do not find any Author has taken
notice of them, nor could I ever meet with more than one Man that had ta∣ken
notice or knew any thing of them, tho' the Island has been long inhabit∣ed
and planted by the <HI>English;</HI> which Shell I have formerly shewn to this So∣ciety,
who were satisfy'd by the Characteristick that it is a Species of the
<HI>Nautili.</HI></P>
<P>And as we yet want a <HI>Hortus Sinensis, Japonensis, Tartaricus, Canadensis Vir∣ginianus,
Brasilianus, Peruvianus, Americanus,</HI> &amp;c. so we want the Natural Hi∣stories
of the Animals of most kinds, of those places, and even of the Fishes
which are frequently enough met with by Navigators, tho' not further taken
notice of than as they may be useful for their present Food, or the like. We
are therefore two hasty in our Computations and summing up all we have,
and concluding that must be the summe of all that can be had; for that there
are yet many particulars behind, that must come into the same account before
the inclosure be fully made and the Books be shut, if at least a full Account
be expected. We are informed by Mr.—<HI>Cole,</HI> and divers other late, inqui∣sitive
Men, how many new things have been discover'd here at home, where
<PB N="435" REF="414"/>
yet there have not formerly been wanting inquisitive Men; what then may
we not expect from other places where none such have ever come, at least,
that we know of?</P>
<P>Again, how apt should we have been, if there had been found a Petrify'd
<HI>Stella arboresceus Rondeletii,</HI> before we had been certify'd of the existence of
such a strange shaped Fish of the Species of the <HI>Stellae,</HI> to have concluded
there had never been such a Fish, because it differs so very much from the
Star-fishes or five Fingers, as they term them, commonly taken on our Coasts?
The like may be infer'd concerning the strange variety I have seen of the <HI>E∣chini</HI>
brought from several parts; for they differ much more from one another
than the Helmet Stones, which I have hitherto seen, do from several sorts
of them: The like may be said of the varieties of Sharks Teeth, as to one
another, and as to the <HI>Glossopetrae</HI> found upon the Land.</P>
<P>So that upon the whole we may conclude, that it does not necessarily fol∣low,
that those <HI>Species</HI> of <HI>Nautili,</HI> must be now wholly lost that produced
the moulding Shells of these <HI>Ophiomorphite</HI> Stones, we find here in <HI>England,</HI>
because they are not now found upon our Shores, nor because we cannot now
certainly affirm where they are to be found, and therefore that the induction
or inference is made from too few Particulars, and may, nay, ought to be ex∣amined
a-new, when we can procure a more full Account of the Productions
of the Shores and Oceans, which Time and Industry may possibly effect.</P>
<P>But not further to insist upon this way of Defence, we will, for the pre∣sent,
take this Supposition to be real and true, that there have been in for∣mer
times of the Word, divers <HI>Species</HI> of Creatures, that are now quite lost,
and no more of them surviviug upon any part of the Earth. Again, That
there are now divers <HI>Species</HI> of Creatures which never exceed at present a cer∣tain
Magnitude, which yet, in former Ages of the World, were usually of
a'much greater and Gygantick Standard; suppose ten times as big as at pre∣sent;
we will grant also a supposition that several <HI>Species</HI> may really not have
been created of the very Shapes they now are of, but that they have changed
in great part their Shape, as well as dwindled and degenerated into a dwar∣fish
Progeny; that this may have been so considerable, as that if we could
have seen both together, we should not have judged them of the same Species.
We will further grant there may have been, by mixture of Creatures, pro∣duced
a sort differing in Shape, both from the Created Forms of the one and
other Compounders, and from the true Created Shapes of both of them.
And yet I do not see how this doth in the least derogate from the Power, Wis∣dom
and Providence of God, as is alledged, or that it doth any ways con∣tradict
any part of the Scripture, or any Conclusion of the most eminent
Philosophers, or any rational Argument that may be drawn from the Phaeno∣mena
of Nature; nay, I think the quite contrary Inferences may, nay, must,
and ought to be made.</P>
<P>For first we do find that all individuals are made of such a Constitution, as
that beginning from an Atom, as it were, they are for a certain period of
Time increasing and growing, and from thence begin to decay, and at last
Die and Corrupt. And in every part of their Life they are in a continual
change or progress, from more perfect to more imperfect, there being a continual
growth or Death and Decay to the final Dissolution; yet this is not Argu∣ment
against the Omnipotence, Providence and Wisdom of the Creator, who
thought fit so to Create them. Again, we find that the Powers and Facul∣ties
of the animated Bodies do continually exert a succession of differing Ef∣fects,
and continually change the Figures and Shapes from one degree to an∣other.
As we see that there are many changings both within and without
the Body, and every state produces a new appearance, why then may there
not be the same progression of the Species from its first Creation to its final
termination? Or why should the supposition of this be any more a derogation
to the Perfection of the Creator, than the other; besides, we find nothing
in Holy Writ that seems to argue such a constancy of Nature; but on the
contrary many Expressions that denote a continual decay, and a tendency to
a final Dissolution; and this not only of Terrestial Beings▪ but of Celestial,
even of the Sun, Moon and Stars and of the Heavens themselves. Nor have
<PB N="436" REF="415"/>
I hitherto met with any Doctrine among the Philosophers, that is repugnant
to this Doctrine, but many that agree with it, and suppose the like States
to happen to all Celestial Bodies, that is, to the Stars and Planets that
happen to the Individuals of any Species; and consequently if the Body of
the Earth be accounted one of the number of the Plantes, then that also is
subject to such Changes and final Dissolution, and then at least it must be
granted, that all the Species will be lost; and therefore, why not some at one
time and some at another? This Objection therefore, I conceive, is of little
validity against the Doctrine I have delivered, and therefore I shall proceed
to the second Objection, and examine the Validity thereof.</P>
<P>It is Objected then in the Second place, That since it is manifest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d. <HI>obj.</HI> As to figured Spars and Chrystals.</NOTE> that
there are many curiously figured Bodies found in the Earth, which cannot be
imagin'd to be produc'd by the Causes and Means that I have alledg'd as the
Shapes of Salts, Sparrs, Ores, Chrystals, and divers other kinds of regular
mineral Bodies, also, Agates Mochuses, curiously speckled Marbles, and the
like. Now, since it must be granted, that they are made by a Plastick Facul∣ty,
why may not that Faculty extend also so far as to be the cause of those
other Figured Stones, which resemble Shells or other Animal or Vegetable
Substances?</P>
<P>To this I answer, That tho' it be manifest,. that Salts, Chrystals, Sparrs.
&amp;c. do plainly receive their regular Figures from the Texture or Naturae of
their own Parts, as is evident, most especially in the Chrystallization of Salts,
and the Petrifactions of the like Figur'd Substances, yet the Figures, and
painted and stained Shapes, as it were of <HI>Agates, Mochus's</HI> and the like, are
not to be ascribed to the Designs of Nature, but to the Productions of
Chance; for instance, the Pictures that in <HI>Mochus's</HI> seem to represent Trees,
Hills, Houses, and other perspective Representations, they are no otherwise
caused than by some Clefts, or Flaws in the said Stones, into which some
colour'd juices have insinuated themselves, and by that means formed those
Representations which appear in the Body of the Stone, and that this is so,
and may be Artificially produc'd by several Bodies and Liquors, which have
no affinity, either with <HI>Agate, Mochus,</HI> or Marble, I can make it plainly ap∣pear
by Experiment, which, if it be thought fit, I shall produce either now,
or the next Meeting.</P>
<P>THe Experiment here mention'd, was by taking two flat Marbles or Glass-plates,
and laying upon one of them several drops of a dark Oil-colour, such as Pain∣ters
use, and pressing the other flat Stone or Glass upon it, by that compressure seve∣ral
curious Representations, like the branchings of Vegetables, and the like, were ex∣hibited;
which explain'd the Representations in <HI>Agates,</HI> &amp;c. a different colour'd mi∣neral
Juice insinuating itself into the Clefts or Interstices of the Stone, and asterwards
petrify'd to an equal hardness with the rest of the Stone; tho' many times there is a
different hardness in the Veins, or Representations from the other parts of the Stone,
as is seen in Marbles and other <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ed Stone.</P>

<P>We have lately had an Account from Mr. <HI>Tentzelius</HI> Historiographer of the
Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> of the Skeleton of an Elephant found buried in <HI>Germany,</HI> at
the Foot of a Hill or Mountain at fourteen Foot deep, and cover'd with
several Layers of Earth, but buried in a Sand, which the whole adjacent
Mountain is found to consist of, being at a place call'd <HI>Tonna</HI> near <HI>Erfond</HI> in
<HI>Germany.</HI> [I take notice of these Particulars, because they may be found to
give some light as to the explication of an other Phaenomenon which I shall
by and by relate.] Now, tho' <HI>Tentzelius</HI> really judged and pronounced it
to be the Skeleton of an Elephant, yet it was not without the Contradiction of
many others of divers differing Opinions; the greatest number of which were
for asserting it to be <HI>a Lusus Nature,</HI> as it seems the whole Colledge of <HI>Gottha,</HI>
and divers other Learned Professors; but their Arguments are prov'd insig∣nificant,
and his own Doctrine sufficiently Establish'd in the Epistles which
he wrote to Snr. <HI>Magliabechi</HI> and Publish'd in Print, and this Honourable So∣ciety
<PB N="437" REF="416" MS="y"/>
were yet farther convinc'd of the certainty of it, by the Fragments and Spe∣cimens
of the trials he had made of several of those Bones: But, after all, great Dif∣ficulties
arose concerning the Means and Cause of the burying of itat such a
place, and at such a depth and the covering of it, to be the natural Layer of the
Earth, and not the Artificial, filling up of a Grave or Pit dug by Art to bury
it; Some attributed it to the effect of <HI>Noah's</HI> Flood, as 'tis usual for most to do
in the like Cases, where they can think of no other Cause; to me, I confess,
it seem'd rather to be the effect of some preceding Earthquakes, as I formerly
here deliver'd in a Discourse on that Subject, when I first met with a Relation
of it, as I have in other Discourses also about <HI>Lignum Fossile</HI> or Subterrane∣ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Trees, and other Substances found buried, and now dug out from under
the Ground, not only in <HI>Italy, Germany</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> &amp;c. but even in <HI>England,
Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI> Now, because by our forreign Gazets, and also by our
own from them of a late Phaenomenon in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> we have the History of
a late Earthquake that happened there this present Year, whose effects do
give an evident Proof of the Doctrine which I supposed, and indeavour'd to
maintain, I thought it would not be improper to mention it here, and to
add it as a further addition to the History of Nature. I shall indeavour to
get the full Account of it Printed at <HI>Batavia</HI> in <HI>Java,</HI> an Abstract of which
was Printed in the <HI>Harlem</HI> Currant in <HI>October</HI> last, and an Epitomy of that
in our Weekly News-papers, which was this. Transcrib'd out of the <HI>Lon∣don</HI>

<P><HI>“Amsterdam October</HI> 2. Our Letters from <HI>Batavia</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies</HI> of the
8th of <HI>February,</HI> say, That on the fifth of <HI>January,</HI> about two in the Morn∣ing,
a most terrible Earthquake happen'd, which was so violent, that one
and twenty Brick Houses, and twenty others were overturn'd, so that if it
had lasted a little longer they must have been all thrown down. About 40
or 50 Persons were Buried alive under the Ruins of the Houses that fell, and
near the same number were Lamed. Some small time before the Earth∣quake,
the Blew Mountain, otherwise call'd Mount <HI>Sales,</HI> burst, with such
a terrible Flame and Noise, that it was both seen and heard there, tho' six
Days Journey distant. Next Morning the River which falls into the Sea
here, and has its Rise from that Mountain, became very high and Muddy,
and brought down abundance of Bushes and Trees half Burnt; and the
Passage being stopt, the Water overflow'd the Country round, all the
Gardens about the Town, and some of our Streets; so that the Fishes lay
Dead in them: It was a whole Month before the River could be clear'd,
altho' 3000 <HI>Indians</HI> were daily imploy'd to clear the same, during which
time we were oblig'd to fetch fresh Water from <HI>Bantam,</HI> which is forty Miles.
All the Fish in the River, except the Carps, were kill'd by the Mud and dirty
Water: A great number of drown'd Buffaloes, Tigers, Rhinocero's, Deer,
Apes, and other Wild Beasts, were brought down by the Current; and
notwithstanding a Crocadile is Amphibious, several of them were found
Dead among the rest.”</P>
<P>The Phaenomena of this Earthquake, tho' they afford a probable soluti∣on
of the more common Phaenomena of fossile Trees, Wood, Nutts, Leaves,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Vegetables, and of the fossile parts of Animals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> such as Teeth,
Hornes, Bones; yet there are some other strange Phaenomena, which I con∣jecture
to have been effected by the same efficient Cause. If it be inquir'd
what those strange Phaenomena are, that I may give you an Instance, I shall
acquaint you with one I late met with and receiv'd from a curious Person, who
made the Observations himself, of which I have since been confirm'd by an∣other
curious Person who had seen and observ'd all the same Particulars. The
Relation, in short, is this.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>A Description of the Ridge of Mary Burrow in the Queens County in
Ireland.</HEAD>
<P>“This Ridge runs North and South, from <HI>Tymohoe</HI> to <HI>Mary-burrow,</HI> about
seven Miles, from thence towards <HI>Montmelick,</HI> four Miles further, and as
this Author was inform'd through the King's County of <HI>Westmeath,</HI> towards
<PB N="438" REF="417" MS="y"/>
<HI>Athlone,</HI> but in these last mention'd Countries is much lower than in the
Queens County.”</P>
<P>“From the said <HI>Tymohoe</HI> to <HI>Montmelick,</HI> being both in the Queens County,
it is about fourteen or fifteen Foot high, where highest, as near as this Au∣thor
can conjecture, being laid as irregular as the Sands are usually laid by
the Waves on the Sea-shoar, with several bendings in and out, high
and low; the Sides so steep, that in most places not easy to ride up, and in
many places Trees growing on the Sides, and a little thin Skin of Grass,
apt to be burnt or scorch'd with the least dry Weather.”</P>
<P>“It is so broad on the top as to afford room enough for four Horse-men to
ride a Breast, the Road, in many places, lying on the top thereof.”</P>
<P>“It is compos'd altogether of small rough Pebble grayish Stones about the
bigness of a Mans Fist; and other smaller ones mix'd with Sand or Gravel,
but no mixture of Clay or Loam, as this Author ever observ'd, which several
times he sought after as he travell'd that way.”</P>
<P>“None of the Lands adjacent to this Ridge have any of the materials where∣of
it is compos'd, mix'd with their Soils; in most places there are Boggs to
within a very few Yards of its Foot, and where any Arrable lies near it, there
is no mixture of the above Pebble or Sand therewith.”</P>
<P>“So that it should seem probable that this Ridge of Pebble and Sand was
brought from some remote places by some violent motion of Waters, and
dispos'd into the form it now remains in, which induc'd the Author se∣veral
times to say, he believ'd it to be the effects of <HI>Noah's</HI> Flood, the Con∣sideration
whereof he refers to better Judgments.”</P>
<P>“If any farther Particulars relating to this Ridge are desir'd, and a few

<P><HI>MAY</HI> 26. 1697. We have lately had several Accounts of Animal Sub∣stances
of various kinds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Animal substances found buried.</NOTE> that have been found buried in the superficial
Parts of the Earth, that is not very far below the present Surface; as par∣ticularly
the parts of the Head of an <HI>Hippopotamus</HI> at <HI>Chartham</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> that of
the Bones <HI>Mammatoroykost,</HI> or of a strange Subterraneous Animal, as the
<HI>Siberians</HI> fancy, which is commonly dug up in <HI>Siberia,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Ludolphus</HI> judges
to be the Teeth and Bones of Elephants; and indeed that peice which I saw of it
was much like Ivory in its Texture, only the out side of it seem'd to have
been cover'd by a kind of Skin, which I never heard of or saw any Elephants
Tooth so cover'd with; then the Bones and Teeth of a large Elephant lately
dug up in <HI>Pomerania,</HI> of which I some while since transcrib'd the Relation out
of one of the late Monthly Mercuries, and read it at one of the Meetings of
<PB N="439" REF="418" MS="y"/>
this Society; also the great Bone in the Repository presented to the Society by
Sir <HI>Tho' Brown,</HI> which was found upon the foundering or calying of some Cliff in
<HI>Norfolk,</HI> which seems to have been the Leg-bone of some Elephant, if it be not
some Bone of the fore Fin of some Whale; 'tis equally admirable which soever
it may be found to be by one skill'd in the Ofteology of those Creatures; and
lastly the great Hornes that have been often found and dug up in <HI>Ireland,</HI> of which
the account is Printed in the last Transaction; all which, and divers others
which I could mention, do shew that the present superficial Parts of the Earth
have suffer'd very great Alterations, which I in my Lectures in 1664. indea∣vour'd
to prove to have been the effects of some preceding Earthquakes, with∣out
which Supposition I cannot conceive any probable Cause can be assigned,
much less can there be any such rational Cause assigned for the Position of ma∣ny
other Phaenomena which have been observ'd of such like Substances found
and dug up at much greater depths, that is, of more than two or three Fa∣thoms
below the present Surface, at which depth those I have mention'd are
said to be found. I conceive it will be very improbable to assign the Cause to
the universal Deluge of <HI>Noah,</HI> and much more so to
ascribe it to any particular
Deluge, as to that of <HI>Deucalion,</HI> &amp;c. for how could the Flood bury the Shells of Fishes
in the middle of some of the highest <HI>Alps,</HI> and cover them with a prodigious height
or thickness of Rocky Mountains? Or how should the bottom of the Sea come to
be raised to such a prodigious height above the present bottom of the Sea at the
Shore next such places? To me, I confess, it seems a most improbable, and ground∣less
supposition: Improbable, for that 'tis hardly conceivable how the Water
should heap up these Substancess, such prodigious masses of Stony or Earthy
Concretions; and groundless,
for that we have no mention in Sacred or Pro∣phane
History of any such effects produced by a Flood. However, tho' we
should grant that Elephants might be carry'd by the Waters of the universal
Deluge from the more Southern or Aequinoctial Parts to those Northern of
<HI>Siberia</HI> or <HI>Pomerania,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of a ship found buried deep in the Ground.</NOTE> yet how shall we conceive by what means the universal
Deluge should bury a Ship and forty Men at a hundred Fathom under Ground,
and that at so great a distance from the Sea, as <HI>Switzerland</HI> now is, of which
nevertheless we have an undoubted History? I say undoubted, because I
have not found any Author that has question'd the truth of this Relation.
Now, tho' I confess I did not know 'till lately (upon perusing Dr. <HI>Wagners</HI>
curicus Natural History of <HI>Switzerland</HI>) who inform'd me who was the first
Historian that had acquainted the World with this discovery, tno' I had met
with the account in several other Historians, yet none of them speaking of it
with any doubting Expression I conceiv'd it must be related by some Historian
of good Repute. This Enquiry then Dr. <HI>Wagner</HI> answer'd by telling me the
first relater of it, which was <HI>Baptista Fulgost</HI> Duke of <HI>Genoua,</HI> which Author's
Book I have since procur'd, and have read his Account of it, which I will pre∣sently
give you as I find it express'd by <HI>Camillus Gilnus</HI> in Elegant Latine, be∣ing
by himself, and his Father translated from the Original, Publish'd by the
Author in the Year 1483, but the Book translated into Latin was Printed
1565. In this Book I find an account of the Author, and the Esteem he had,
and the occasion of the writing of it, which was partly to drive away melan∣choly
Reflections on his past Misfortunes, having lost his Dukedome, and
partly for Instruction to his own Son. In which Relation 'tis remarkable, that
this Ship and Men should be buried so deep in the Earth as a hundred Fa∣thom
or six hundred Foot. Next, that the Bodies of forty Men should be
found in the Ship itself. <HI>3dly.</HI> That this should be a Ship of the Ocean, and
not of some River, because of the great distance of it from the Sea. <HI>4thly.</HI>
That the Anchors and Sails, tho' torn, should yet remain and be plainly' dis∣coverable.
<HI>5thly.</HI> That he did not take this Story from uncertain Report,
but from divers grave Men, who had been Eye-witnesses of it, who had in∣form'd
him themselves. <HI>6thly.</HI> That it was so remarkable in that time, that
the Learned Men had meditated and reason'd on it to assign the Cause of it;
that is, to give a rational Hypothesis, by which to shew how it might come
to pass; they having it seems pitch'd upon two especially, which do both of
them to me seem very insufficient, not to say very absurd. So that upon the
whole Matter, there seems to me no Reason or Cause to doubt the matter of
<PB N="440" REF="419"/>
Fact or the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, but all the difficulty lies in the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> that then shall be the
next thing to be examin'd, and that the rather, because this seems to be a
true <HI>Experimentum Crucis</HI> to distinguish between my Hypothesis and those of
some other Authors. As first, concerning the two Solution specify'd by the
Author, not as his own, but as of some other Philosophical Men, who then
lived, and who were satisfy'd, it seems, of the truth of the discovery, and 'tis
not unlikely it might be some of those. <HI>Plurimi Graves viri qui rem perspexerunt
&amp; qui in Re presenti fuere a quibus ipse accepit.</HI> For as for himself he ventures
not at any Solution, but says only <HI>Caeterum utcunq; res fuerit admirationis non
Mediocres relinquit Causas.</HI></P>
<P>First then, for the Hypothesis of <HI>Noah's</HI> Flood,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>That it could not be from</HI> Noah's <HI>time.</HI></NOTE> 'tis not said in any Histo∣ry,
that Navigation, especially on the Ocean, was grown to such a perfection
in <HI>Noah's</HI> time as to make Ships of that bigness and perfection of Anchors,
Sail and Rigging, as this by this short Description seems to have been;
and 'tis very likely if any such Navigation had been, it would have been ta∣ken
notice of in the History of the Bible; for it cannot be suppos'd that
<HI>Noah</HI> should not be inform'd of it, if any such Art had been then practiced in
any part of the World how remote soever from the place of his Abode. Next,
if such should have been, it might have happen'd that some ther Men or
Creatures might have escap'd with Life besides those in the Ark. Next, sup∣posing
that there had been such a perfection of Navigation at the time of the
Flood, I cannot conceive how a Ship of that bigness, as this seems to have
been, should be carry'd down so deep under the surface of the Earth as 600
Foot: Certainly a twelve Month soaking of the Earth, much less forty Days,
could not reduce the superficial Parts to such a hasty pudding Consistence as
this Phaenomenon does seem to require, since I doubt whether there can be
found the World any part of the bottom of the Sea, that has been soaked
for some thousands of Years, that is so softned.</P>
<P>Next for the second Hypothesis of a Subterraneous Navigation, to me, I
confess it seems a ridiculous Supposition, tho' I know a late Author has im∣brac'd
such an Hypothesis to solve the Phaenomena of Sea-shells, and the like
Substances found in Mountains and Mines; tho' Mr. <HI>Purchas</HI> has Publish'd a
like Story of <HI>Andrew Knivet,</HI> but I am apt to think that most Readers will
look upon it as told by a Seaman and a Traveller.</P>
<P>But the Matter of Fact being so well attested, it must at least be suppos'd
to be there plac'd by some Natural Cause, as must also all those other Phaeno∣mena
I have ment'on'd.</P>
<P>Now for assigning a Cause sufficient, I conceive there cannot be a more
probable one, than the effect of Earthquakes, which have, and do still pro∣duce
as considerable Effects as any of these; the late Relations we have had
of the effects wrought by them in <HI>Lima, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> among the <HI>Cariby</HI> Islands, a∣mong
the <HI>East-India</HI> Islands, about <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> in <HI>Norway,</HI> and in the Island of
<HI>Sicily,</HI> will furnish us with Phaenomena almost as strange; besides it seems ra∣tional
to believe, that Earthquakes in former Ages before we had History,
were not only more frequent, but much greater and more powerful.</P>
<P>These, I conceive, have not only produc'd wonderful Effects in this or that
part of the Earth at one time, but at many times successively, possibly at the
distance of many Ages; so that at one time they may have raised the bottom of
the Sea to make a dry Land, and sunk other parts so as to be overflow'd by
the Sea, which were before far above the Surface of the Water, or to make
Inland Seas or Lakes, as that of <HI>Geneva</HI> and divers others thereabouts: But
by succeeding Earthquakes those effects may have been quite differing, so as
to sink again those parts it had raised, and raise again and fill up with other
Earthy or Stony Matter, those it had formerly sunk, and so also by various
Efforts at various Times it may have overturn'd and turn'd upside down, or
otherwise tumbl'd and confounded the parts of the Earth, which seems plainly
to be hinted to us by the Mythologick Story of the Giants fighting with the
Caelestial Powers, and heaping Mountains upon Mountains; and (I do confess)
I conceive there can be nothing more reasonable and conformable to the pro∣ceeding
of Nature in these Times, than to suppose there have been the like and
much greater, in former Ages of the World.</P>
<P><PB N="441" REF="420"/>
I conceive then, that whenever that part of <HI>Switzerland</HI> was the bottom of
the Sea, this Vessel (which the Author calls <HI>Navis</HI> or a Ship) was upon that
Sea over this very place, when there happen'd an Earthquake just underneath
it, which did raise the same above the level of the Water, as much as it now
is; and that by this there having happen'd to be an Opening, Clearing, or
Chasm in the Ground under it which swallow'd up some of the
Sea; and with
it this Vessel, and afterwards closed again, and inclosed what it had swallow∣ed;
or else that this part had been some very deep Inland Lake, as that of
<HI>Geneva,</HI> and divers others there about, that this Vessel was Navigating in
this place when some Earthquake happen'd, which overthrew some Neigh∣bouring
Mountain, Hill or Lands, which, falling into this Water, did not on∣ly
sink the Ship, but fill'd up and levell'd the Lake with the Contiguous Lands
or Shoars of it; neither of which ways of explicating it do need any other ef∣fect,
but such as we are by antient and much more later Observations ascer∣tain'd,
are the usual effects of Earthquakes.</P>
<P>I have consider'd the Passage mention'd by <HI>Leo. Bapt. Alberti</HI> in the fifth
Book and Twelfth Chapter, concerning <HI>Trajan's</HI> Ship found in his time in <HI>Ita∣ly.</HI>
Now, I find that this <HI>Alberti</HI> was a <HI>Florentine</HI> Gentleman, who flourish'd
about the Year 1483, and was accounted the <HI>Vitruvius</HI> of his Time: He be∣ing
a Scholar, an excellent Painter, Sculptor and Mechanist, and an excel∣lent
Architect, he was the first that indeavour'd the Explication of <HI>Vitruvius,</HI>
in which he made great progress, much to the improvement of that Age; in
order to which he survey'd and measur'd the remainders of Antiquity; he un∣derstood
Perspective also, and writ a Book on that Subject, which was not well
understood by the Antients, not much by the Moderns in his Time. But my
present Inquiry is chiefly about this Passage mention'd in his Book <HI>De Re Aedi∣fitatoria,</HI>
produc'd the last Day by Mr. <HI>Bridgman</HI> concerning <HI>Trajans</HI> Ship
discover'd in <HI>Alberti's</HI> Time, which had lain sunk in a Lake of <HI>Italy,</HI> which
he calls <HI>Nemorensis,</HI> ever since the time of <HI>Trajan,</HI> which was near one hundr∣ed
Years after Christ, for he died in the Year ninty eight, which is now full
sixteen Hundred Years since, and so was more than thirteen Hundred in the
time of <HI>Alberti.</HI> The Passage is as follows. <HI>Leo Baptista Albert<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s De Re Aedi∣ficatoria.

of it, I have not met with, nor can I find any such Lake as is call'd <HI>Lacus Ne∣moreasis,</HI>
or <HI>Nenorensi Lago,</HI> as <HI>Petrus Laurus,</HI> in his Translation of this Book
into the Vulgar <HI>Italian</HI> renders it. <HI>Bartoli,</HI> who Translated this Book into <HI>Ita∣lian</HI>
after <HI>Causes</HI> renders it <HI>Lago della <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> indeed mentions a Ship
of <HI>Layus,</HI> which was purposely sunk at <HI>Ostia</HI> to found the Mole upon; but he
could not say any thing of this, he dying almost 20 Years before <HI>Trajans</HI> time;
nor do I treat upon what occasion it was that caus'd them to dig it out, nor
at what depth it was found, nor whether it were buried in the Ground, or
were only sunk into the Mud: If any have met with any further information
concerning it in their Reading, I should be glad to be inform'd concerning it.
<HI>Fulgosus</HI> having writ his Book much about the same time that <HI>Alberti</HI> writ this,
I thought I might have met with some account of it in him, it being some-what
Analogous with his Relation of the Ship found in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> about the
same time; but I do not find he hath any mention of it. It seems pretty
strange how either of these Ships should come to be transported
into the places
where they are said to be found; but 'till we know the History we can at
best but conjecture concerning them. There are many other particulars I
should have defir'd information of besides those which he has mention'd, and
'tis very likely some of them may have been taken notice of in the Relation
of its discovery, which I am inclin'd to believe must be somewhat more at large
and more fully related than we find it here, which Only hints two Remarkables
<PB N="442" REF="421"/>
proper to the purpose, for which it is mention'd, <HI>viz.</HI> About the durableness
of Timber fit for building of Ships in its own Nature: And, Secondly, Of
the way of securing it against the Corrosion of Worms, which it seems was so
long since taken notice of and provided against by the Shipwhrites of <HI>Trajan</HI>'s
Time; which they perform'd by a double Sheathing; the first, next the double
Planking, (<HI>Tabulis extrinsecus duplicem Superextensam &amp; pice, atra perfusam tela
ex lino adglutinarant</HI>) was a kind of Tarpollin, they covering the Planks with
Pitch, and that Pitch with Linnen-cloth sticking to it; the second was a thin
sheet of Lead fastn'd by Brass Nails to the-Plank;, that it was very thin, I think
is denoted by <HI>Charta Plumbea,</HI> that is, such kind of thin Lead as they formerly
us'd for Writing on, much like the thinnest sort of Mill'd-Lead now made by
the new Engine; which how they made is not known, nor do we certainly
know how they make the like Sheets of Lead in <HI>China,</HI> of which kind I have
seen a great variety, and all of it very even and regular: The Plumber will
tell you 'tis done by Casting the Lead on Ticking, but that I conceive will
not make it so thin and even as I have seen it; we have a way of beating it
after the manner of Gold-beating, which doth foliate it very thin and even,
'tis commonly call'd <HI>Tin Foile,</HI> and 'tis us'd for foiling Looking-glasses; 'tis a
mixture of Lead and Tin, as is also the <HI>Tootenag</HI> of <HI>China,</HI> and possibly theirs
may be done the same way; but the Rowlers in the Mill I take to be much the
better way; 'tis by somesuch. Engine they foliate Brass and Copper in <HI>Germany,</HI>
tho' they do some sorts also with the Hammer, as Kettles, and the thin Iron Plates
for Latton by beating many of them together at once, as they do also Leaf-gold,
Silver and Brass; but Asidue somewhat thicker, is done by an Engine with
Rowlers, as they flatten Wire for Threads; and To also is a sort of Sheet Brass
somewhat thicker: Possibly both ways may be known and made use of in
<HI>China,</HI> where they have many other curious Inventions which we have not
yet attain'd, and 'tis not unlikely but that the Antient <HI>Romans</HI> might for this
foliating of Lead, have somewhat the same.</P>
<P>Now as to the use of it for Sheathing of Ships, I find the <HI>Spamard,</HI> make use
of it at this time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sheathing Ships with lead known in the <HI>Romans.</HI></NOTE> and have done so for a long time. This I find Sir <HI>Rich-Hawkins</HI>
takes notice of in the account of his Voyage to the South Sea, Page 87,
which see.</P>
<P>Here we have an account of all the ways of Sheathing of Ships he knew,
and his Judgment or Censure of them, which how just they, are must be left to
Experienc'd Men; however, I have been lately inform'd that the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
make use of the same way still for their Gillions, which 'tis not likely they
would if they knew any way better; they had indeed another help to keep
out the Water in case of any failure in the outward Plant, and that is the fil∣ling
all the Space between the Ribbs and Planks with a certain sort of Plaister
which may be a security to the innermost Plank, but not at all to the outermost
against the Worm or Springing of them; however, 'tis of good use to keep off
suddain overflow or entrance of the Water in case of either Defect. But the
best way of all seems to be the <HI>Chinese,</HI> by the Varnish, which neither
Worms nor Water, nor Heat will damnify; nor in their way of building their
junks, do they leave any vacuity in the thickness of the sides to need Plaister,
but what is fill'd with Damar, which is in itself lighter than Water, and will
swim on it. But that way is not practicable here in <HI>Europe</HI> where we want the
Varnish, whereas the others are, especially that of Sheet Lead, of which
Metal this Nation affords us great plenty, and the late invented Mill doth
certainly out do all other for giving it a proper Form; besides, if Plaister
were necessary, we have as good as the World affords, or which possibly may
be better, we can have Pitch enough (much of the same Nature and Use
with Damar) to prevent any suddain gushing in of the Water: But this only
by the bye:</P>
<P>The strangeness of the Relation or History of the Ship found sunk in a
Lake, some where in <HI>Italy,</HI> mention'd by <HI>Leo. Bapt. Albert,</HI> and the short∣ness
and imperfection thereof as deliver'd by him, made me very desirio us to
get a more full and perfect Relation thereof. I thought <HI>Baysius</HI> in his Treatise
<HI>De Re Navali</HI> might have taken notice of it, he having Written since that
time; but he has never a word concerning it as I can find, nor do I find any
<PB N="443" REF="422" MS="y"/>
mention of it in <HI>Dassie</HI>'s Book <HI>de L' Architecture Navale;</HI> but <HI>Pere Fournier</HI> in
his Hydrography (Book the Fourth, Chap, the First) treating of the Naviga∣tion
which was before the universal Deluge of <HI>Noah,</HI> says, it seems rational to
think that (considering the long Life of Men before the Flood, and the po∣pulousness
of those Times) there was no part of the World uninhabited, tho'
we have no History of them but the Bible, and tho' that has not one word
concerning it; and that not only the great Continents of Land, but there be∣ing
Islands both in the Seas and Rivers, those also were inhabited which
could not be suppos'd without the use of some kind of Navigation. Add to
this in the third place, that 'tis reasonable to think that the <HI>Antediluvians</HI>
were as ingenious, if not much more, than the <HI>Postdiluvians,</HI> for the invent∣ing
of Ships, and for the use of them, for the transplaning of Colonies, for
Trading and for War. Moreover (says he) in the Year 1462, as is Record∣ed
by <HI>Fulgosus,</HI> at <HI>Bern</HI> in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> as they were working in the Mines, at
above a hundred Fathom deep in the Earth, there was found an old Wood∣en
Ship built as ours are, whose Anchors were of Iron and the Sails of Lin∣en,
with the Carkasses of forty Men. <HI>Peirre Naxis</HI> Relates a like Histo∣ry
of another, such a one as was found under a very high Mountain. In like
manner the Jesuite <HI>Eusebius Neurembergius,</HI> in the Second Chapter of the Fifth
Book of his Natural History, says, “That near the Port of <HI>Lima</HI> in <HI>Peru,</HI> as
they were working a Mine for Gold, those which follow'd the Vein in the
Mountain found an old Ship, which had many old Characters very differing
from ours, which ail People believed to have been there buried by the uni∣versal
Deluge.”—<HI>Nam{que} Juxt a portum Lime in Peru cum eviscerar at
avaritia terram, insecuta auri vename, Navigium inventum est sub ipso monte, quod a
nostris, &amp; hactenus fame &amp; Script's antiquorum notis plurimum dissidebat. Credi∣tum{que}
ab universis illuvie fuisse humatum.</HI> There was found also in a very high
Mountain of <HI>Mexico</HI> a prodigiously large Elephants Tooth, tho' in all <HI>Ame∣rica.</HI>
there was never yet found any Elephant. “Without doubt (says he) all
these things have been thus buried by the tumbling and overturnings of a
universal Deluge, as well as the Wreeks of other Vessels which have been
found at three Thousand Stadiums or Furlongs from the Sea, as <HI>Strabo</HI> re∣lates
in his First Book.”
Thus far Father <HI>Fournier</HI> to this purpose. Nor do I
find that he hath taken any notice or made the least mention of this Vessel,
mention'd by <HI>Alberti,</HI> which, methinks, he should not have been ignorant of,
especially considering the great Pains he has taken, and great Learning he
hath shewn concerning the Subject of Shipping.</P>
<P>The <HI>Heer Witsen</HI> in his Book intitled, <HI>Ael Oude en Hoden dueysone Scheeps
Bouven Bastier,</HI> in the Fourth Chapter of his First Book, hath given us a
somewhat larger account and more particular than <HI>Alberti,</HI> but quotes not the
Authors from whom he receiv'd it; so that we must rely on his Reputation
'till we can be better inform'd. His Relation in <HI>Dutch</HI> is to this effect.
“In the time that the Pope, <HI>Pius</HI> the Second, possest the Chair (which I find was
from <HI>August</HI> 1458, to <HI>August</HI> 1464) Men found in the <HI>Numidische</HI> Lake twelve
Fathom under Water, in the Mud, a Ship, in length thirty Foot, and in
breadth proportionable; built of <HI>Cypress</HI> and <HI>Larix</HI> Wood (which is a Species
of Pine-Tree Wood) which was become of such an hardness, that it could
neither be burnt nor broken, if it were needful. This Ship had lain under
the Water for fourteen Hundred Years without the least perceivable Rotting
to decay it: It was on the Deck done over with Pitch, and that cover'd with
a Coat or Crust of a certain Pap or Morter made of Clay and Iron well tem∣per'd
or beaten together, which art of mixtura is now conceil'd; tho' others
are of Opinion that this mixture was not made of Clay and Iron, but of Clay
and Pitch well kneaded together. The Deck was cover'd with Paper, Lin∣nen
Cloth, and Plates of Lead, which were nailed to the Planks with Cop∣per
Nails guilded. This Ship (a wonder) was found so stanch, that not the
least drop of Water was found to have soaked into its Hold; it had the length
of an old <HI>Trireme</HI> Vessel, and the breadth of a Hulk. In the Hold was
found the Hangings of fine Velvet of an Orange Green, and in the mid∣dle
of the Floor a Copper Coffer fastned by four black Strings, which being
open'd there appear'd an Earthen Urne or Vessel, which was ornamented
<PB N="444" REF="423"/>
with a Gold Plate, and fill'd with Ashes; and because Men saw the Name
<HI>Tiberius,</HI> several times engraven upon some Leaden Plates about the Border
of it, they conceiv'd this might be the place of his Sepulture.”</P>
<P>This Account, tho' in divers Particulars different from that of <HI>Alberti,</HI> yet
seems to be translated from the same Original History, which neither for them
having mention'd by what Author it was written, we are yet to seek of the
true account, which probably may be much more particular than either of
these, or both of them put together; for that it is usual in secoud Hand Re∣lations,
to take notice of such Passages of the Original, as concern the pre∣sent
Subject they are treating of, and to omit many other Particulars, tho' in
themselves much more remarkable; this therefore I further sought for in di∣vers
other Authors; and in <HI>Riccioli</HI>'s <HI>Hydrography,</HI> I found a further account
of it, which also gave me a hint of the true Author: <HI>Riccioli</HI>'s Account is
this, Chapter the thirty ninth of the Tenth Book, which whole Chapter
treats of Ships that have been much celebrated for their Magnitude, Splen∣dor,
Voyages, or other very remarkable Conditions; among which, Page
340, he brings in the Ship of <HI>Tiberius</HI> as one very remarkable instance, whose
History he thus describes, <HI>Narrat Aeneas Sylvius, suo tempore repertum in
lacu Numicio Cubitis</HI> 12 <HI>Sub aquam, navem ex Larice Cubitorum</HI> 2<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Bitumine &amp;

<P>Thus we have found at length the Bush where this Game is seated, and
whence it is to be started if we will have it, and I have follow'd it by its scent
and Foot-steps to its Seat; but in what part of the Volume of the Works of
<HI>Aeneas Sylvius,</HI> it is to be found I cannot yet discover, for his Tracts are many
and make a bulky Volume together, which, whether it contain all that he
writ I am not yet well inform'd; for he wrote very many particular Tracts,
and left some imperfect and not ready for the Press, as <HI>Conrad Gesner,</HI> informs
us. This was the Man that, in <HI>August,</HI> 1458, was made Pope, and who died in
<HI>August,</HI> 1464, so that he possest the Chair six Year; within which time it
seems both these discoveries were made, (if at least they were two differing
Discoveries, for possibly they may be only two differing Relations of the same
Discovery) the one noting one sort of Circumstances, and the other, another.
I cannot so well judge of the matter, 'till I find this Relation of <HI>Sylvtus;</HI> how∣ever,
'tis obvious that what <HI>Riccioli,</HI> makes to be only twelve Cubits, Mr.
<HI>Witsen,</HI> makes twelve Fathom, which is four times as much; and possibly this
twelve Fathom or seventy two Foot <HI>Fulgosus,</HI> might make one hundred Cubits,
and yet all of them innocently without a design of imposing on their Readers,
they writing from the Relations of others, and possibly from the failing of
their own Memory to boot; for we find how rare a thing it is to find out the
truth of a Fact, tho' twas done but Yesterday and almost at next Door, if
allowances are not made for the Circumstances of the Relators, and the de∣fects
of every one's Memory and Comprehension;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide Pbilos. Transact. No. 234, p. 757.</NOTE> upon which account it is
that I could wish that Relation concerning the Elephant lately found in <HI>Ger∣many,</HI>
and made by the Colledge of <HI>Gothan,</HI> might be inserted into a Trans∣action
as well as that of <HI>Tentzelius,</HI> that Men might see how much the Hu∣mour
and Inclinations of the Relators will diversify the Relation, and confound
the Apprehension and Judgment of the Reader; and therefore I conceive it
would not be amiss also to add to this last account the Sentiments of this So∣ciety,
or at least of some of their Members, concerning the Substances sent
by <HI>Tentzelius,</HI> to be perus'd and examin'd by them; for there is no better way,
I conceive, in the World to give a satisfactory account to Posterity of this
Fact than this Course; for there cannot be made a good History, either of
things Natural or Artificial, without curious judicious and accurate Observations,
and Pertinent and Critical Experiments, that may be as thoroughly ex∣amin'd
and verify'd, as a Geometrical Proposition by Persons sufficiently accomp∣lish'd
for such a Task. 'Tis not one possibly of a hundred is fit for such a Busi∣ness,
and yet such are necessary, and hence I conceive it is, that we have
such a multitude of medicinal Observations made or pretended to be made by
young Physicians, and possibly not one of five Hundred of any manner of real
<PB N="445" REF="424"/>
Use or Benefit; for that the most of such Writers are two much biassed by
precarious Hypotheses, and many likewise Compose and Publish them only
for Interest, that is, as Advertisements to make themselves the more known,
and so to get Practice; and tho' this or that Symptom may be true and ma∣tter
of Fact, yet the true Cause of the Distemper, and the reason of the Cure
or Miscarriage of the Patient possibly was really quite differing from those as∣sign'd
by them; and tho' some of them may have been truly describ'd, yet
those that know how small and inconsiderable Circumstances in themselves
will yet make great and most considerable alterations in the Effects, will be
more cautious than to take them all for true which are in reality quite other∣wise;
those therefore that relate an Experiment or Observation, should be
both very understanding in the Subject, and very diligent in taking notice of,
and relating the Circumstances of it; for that all that can be done in this way
will be little enough of information to him, that is to make use of it for
making Deductions and Inferrences therefrom, and indeed it will be hazar∣dous
to build any thing upon Foundations so uncertain; for even in the
most perfect Accounts of this Nature, a Writer or Applier of it for the
founding or examining a Theory thereby will find a necessity of ocular in∣spection
and examination proper and fitted to his present Subject, either
to obviate some Objection, or to give some further Light; for oft times the
most considerable part of the whole Experiment may lie in some one trivial
Circumstance, which not one of a thousand would otherwise have thought
worth taking notice of, yet to him that knows what that Circumstance is
that makes for or against his Theory which he is inquiring into, will judge
it very considerable, and be sure not to omit the Scrutiny and Test there∣of;
and 'tis preposterous for any one to write an Experimental Natural Hi∣story
without making and examining the Experiments needful to the per∣fecting
thereof, without making the Experiments himself, nay, and with∣out
the repeating of them, as Doubts may arise after the first Trial, or
as he may need further information upon them; nay, without making them
whilst he is writing, that he may trust, as little as may be, to his own Me∣mory
and Judgment. Thus in Anatomical Experiments and Observations,
how many considerable Discoveries do we owe to such repeated Trials o∣mitted
wholly, or scarce hinted at in many preceding; For every discovery
gives a new set of Doubts and Inquiries, as well as a new Light, not only
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Sed etiam decies repetita placebunt,</HI> as I have very often experimented
my self; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay, I have found it absolutely necessary, and even that not enough to
make some Spectator to apprehend the Consequences thereof: But this only
by the bye. Before I leave this Subject I cannot but take notice of a Doubt
that arises from the variety of these Relations, and that is, whether the
Sheet Lead were used for the Sheathing of the outsides of the Ship under
Water, or only for the Covering and Housing of the Deck, as the <HI>Heer Wit∣sen</HI>
makes it; nor know I how to solve it without seeing the Original Relation,
only I must not omit one Passage of <HI>Riccioli,</HI> which seems to hint the use of
Sheet Lead somewhat Analogous to Sheathing, and that is this, describing
the Ship of <HI>Hieron,</HI> whose Architect was <HI>Archimedes.—Dimedia Pars navis
per</HI> 300 <HI>operartios sex mensibus absoluta, rimae asserum laminis plumbeis tectae,</HI> &amp;c.
My doubt on this Passage is, whether the Vessel were Caulked and Pitched
in the Joints of the Planks under the Sheet Lead, or whether the Plates of
Lead were only made use of instead of Caulking and Pitching, the descrip∣tion
is at large in <HI>Athenaeus,</HI> which I have not by me, and he, it seems, had
it from—, who writ a whole Book of the Description of it: It was
in this Ship where <HI>Archimedes</HI> made use of his admirable Invention of his
helical Pump, which he himself hath no where describ'd.</P>
<P>The small number of Authors that have recorded so remarkable a Phaeno∣menon
as this, informs us how little curious the World have been in the mat∣ter
of Philosophical History, and thence how vain a thing it is to expect to
find every such accident as this to be Recorded, tho' very remarkable in its
self; for if these Ships were differing, then they have each but one Original
Historian; for all the other Authors that have since mention'd them, seem to
have borrow'd the Accounts from these two; but if the Relations were
<PB N="446" REF="425"/>
only of one and the same Vessel, (as methinks the Circumstances of the time
and the being sunk deep into the Earth seem to intimate) then we have but
two Historians that take notice of so remarkable a Fact; and those so discor∣dant
in their Stories, that one knows not which of them to give Credit to;
the one making it to be found in the <HI>Lago de Nemi,</HI> about twenty Miles
from <HI>Rome</HI> towards the West; the other making it to be found near <HI>Berne</HI> in
<HI>Switzerland,</HI> when 'tis not known that ever there was any Lake there, as
<HI>Fulgosus</HI> mentions and Objects. It is therefore unreasonable to reject all Hy∣potheses
that suppose other Accidents to have been the occasions of produc∣ing
Petrify'd Substances, than those Recorded in History, especially if they
happen'd before Printing was in use, or possibly Writing commonly known;
for even since that time many considerable Phaenomena have been very slight∣ly
hinted only, and scarce taken any notice of; as for instance, the Comet
that appear'd in 1580, which produc'd but one diligent Observer and Histo∣rian,
which was <HI>Mich. Mastlin,</HI> and the great Earthquakes and Catastro∣phies
in <HI>China,</HI> which are Recorded in the <HI>Mercurie Hollandois,</HI> and no
where else that I know: So 'tis probable this newly happening Earthquake at
<HI>Constantinople</HI> would have been quickly forgotten, and probably never record∣ed
to Posterity, if the <HI>Gazett</HI> and News Papers had not taken notice of it<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
But this only by the way.</P>
<P>As to this accident of the Ship, I conceive it to have afforded so many par∣ticular
Informations worthy to have been Recorded, that I could wish it had
happen'd in a more curious Age; at least I conceive it very desirable, that the
Original History of it, such as it is, might be sifted out and inserted in a
more proper place to be found, than where it is said to be at present.</P>
<P>The Memoires of the <HI>Parisian Academy</HI> have furnish'd many curious Dis∣coveries
both Mathematical and Physical,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The misfortune of Inventors.</NOTE> yet divers of them or of the
same kind have been first discover'd in this Society, tho' not entertain'd with
that approbation, which they have there met withal; nor are the <HI>English</HI> so
nimble in Publishing what they discover themselves, nor so sharping to arro∣gate
to themselves what they know to have been first discover'd by others;
(as I do find divers to be) who will leave no means unattempted to make all
their own, tho' there be never so evident Arguments against their Cause.
But tho' this be a Practice to be abhor'd by every ingenious Man, and the
bashfulness of the other be blameable, yet there is somewhat to be said both
for the one and the other Party, that may seem to countenance these procee∣dings
of them. As first, 'tis a discouragement to any one to Publish that which
he finds by Discourse is generally disapproved. A Man may rationally e∣nough
distrust his own Thoughts and Reasons, may, and even his Senses too,
if he finds those he converses with to be of another Opinion, tho' acquaint∣ed
with the Arguments that prevail'd with him, at least till he finds, that it
was done for some Sinister Designs to defraud him of his Discovery. Next,
when by publishing, more Opponents or Emulators (which are both Enemies)
are produced, than approvers or indifferent Persons, who at best will do
him no good; 'tis thought better to abstain with quietness, than with Labour
and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndustry, to create new Troubles. But on the other side 'tis certain,
however, that ambitious Minds will try all means to obtain their Designs;
they find that such Practises often prevail, and therefore <HI>Quid tentare No<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ebit;</HI>
they find that the generallity of Men are not much concern'd for the first
Discoverer, and that they usually take him for such, who first acquainted them
with it; and for one Reader that can disprove them, or detect them of Pla∣giary,
there are a thousand that can not, and for those that can, they find
ways to evade and by Confidence carry the point, and even with a general
Approbation and Advantage: 'Tis, I confess, a general Observation, that
seldom the first Inventer reaps either Honour or Advantage by his Inven∣tion,
but on the contrary, those that come in at a second Hand acquire them
both.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> But be it as it will, certain it is, that many Discoveries pretended to
in the Works, of the <HI>French Academy,</HI> were first made here and elsewhere,
nay, and many of them publish'd too in Print, and some of them also in the
<HI>French</HI> Language, which yet they will not own, or mention to have seen. I
shall instance but in two or three things: The First is that of <HI>Torricellius</HI> a∣bout
<PB N="447" REF="426"/>
his Invention and Demonstration of the <HI>Solidum Acutum Hyperbolicum,</HI>
which was Pablish'd by him, together with his other Works at <HI>Florence</HI> in the
Year 1644, and that without Contradiction by <HI>Roberval</HI> ever since; yet now
a Letter is trumpt up, and some Papers found that must needs persuade us
that <HI>Torricellius</HI> stole it from <HI>Roberval.</HI> The like slur is cast upon the Works
of Mr. <HI>James Gregory;</HI> both which Persons have given sufficient Proofs by their
other Works, that they had very little need of stealing from <HI>Roberval,</HI> who
has not yet made it evident, nor any other for him, that he was Master of
either of their Problems, 'till since the publication of them by the said Au∣thors.</P>
<P>The Second is the discovery of the Glade of Light observable in the E∣venings
in <HI>Febr.</HI> and <HI>March</HI> each Year, which was first made by our Dr. <HI>Chil∣drey,</HI>
and an Advertisement of it Publish'd in his <HI>Britannia Baconica,</HI> in the
Year 1660; which Book was Translated into <HI>French,</HI> and Publish'd at <HI>Paris</HI>
soon after, which was long enough before it is pretended to be discover'd
there. However, the second Person has the Title of the discovery, and the
first is defrauded of his due Praise. I could add a hundred other Instances to
prove this Assertion; but I shall not at present spend time thereon, tho' it
may possibly not pass without some Reflections on another Occasion, that e∣very
one, as near as may be, may have his due Praise. For my own part, I
think it ingenuous to mention any thing of theirs, which I have occasion to
make use of, and to own all such things as theirs, as I find to be new or in∣genious;
and that First, Because I would give every one that which is due to
him. But, Secondly, Because I find it necessary to back a Doctrine with a
<HI>French Approbation.</HI> I know there are many things will not be regarded, 'till
they have that Stamp to make them current, and then they will readily pass
with the present Age and Humor.</P>
<P>In the Memoir of the 31st. of <HI>June</HI> 1692, (so 'tis marked) I find an Obser∣vation
concerning a Petrify'd Substance produc'd and examin'd by the <HI>Royal
Academy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Remark out of the</HI> French <HI>Memoires.</HI></NOTE> with some Reflections on it made by Mr. <HI>De la Hire,</HI> which because
consonant to some Discourses I have formerly made in this place, I thought
might countenance somewhat the Doctrine I then deliver'd, I have also
render'd the same in <HI>English</HI> before I make Reflections upon the same.</P>
<P>“The Cabinets (says he) of the curious are fill'd with all forts of Bodies
Petrify'd, as of Plants, Fruits, Woods, and of divers parts of Animals,
but Naturalists are not yet agreed about the cause of their Production; some
supposing them to be Stones so shaped by accident, but others suppose them
produced by a Water that has a power of converting those several Sub∣stances
into Stone, after it has long pickled them; probable Reasons are
alledg'd for each Opinion.”</P>
<P>“Mr. <HI>L' Abbe de Lou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oys</HI> sent to the <HI>Academy;</HI> a Petrifaction, which may
serve to decide this Controversy, namely, two peices of the Trunk of a
Palm converted into Stone, they were brought from <HI>Africa,</HI> with two other
pieces of a Palm just like them, but not Petrify'd, the better to compare
them together; the Petrifactions are <HI>true Flints,</HI> as appears by their hard∣ness,
by their Colour, and somewhat of Transparency, by their Sound,
which is clear and sonorous, and by their Gravity, which is more than ten
times that of the unpetrify'd; yet these two Flints are so like to the two
pieces of Wood, that there is no shew of Reason to conceive, they should
be so formed by chance.”</P>
<P>“One of these Flints which is two Foot long, and about four or five Inches
Diameter, is a piece of the Trunk of a Palm Barked of its Rind; in this
may be seen all the Fibres of the Wood of the bigness of ⅔ of a Line, some
of which are forked; they run the length of the Trunk and are hollow like
Pipes. The Pulp, which is between the Fibres, which serves to join them
together, is chang'd into a kind of <HI>Gluten,</HI> but very hard.”</P>
<P>“Mr. <HI>De la Hire</HI> gives a Reason of the hollowness of the Pipe, <HI>i. e.</HI> that
the outward Parts being dry'd before the middle, when they are dry, they
are by the outward Parts kept from shrinking, and so the Pipes become
stretched from the Center outward (<HI>which is the same Reason with that I have
given for the blebbs that appear in the Glass drops.</HI>)”</P>
<P><PB N="448" REF="427"/>
“Now, tho' some might fancy (yet without the least probability) that this
with straight Fibres might thus be formed by chance, yet 'tis impossible to
conceive so of the other piece, which is a part of the bottom of the Trunk;
for this is not only compos'd of streight Fibres as the other, but its Bark is
all garnish'd with small Roots as big as one's little Finger, and about three
Inches long, which is cover'd with a thin Skin, which, contains an infinite of
small Fibres like Hairs; in the middle of each of these Fibres is a ligneous
Chord, that one may call its <HI>Nuel</HI> or Pith, about ⅓ of the bigness of one's
Finger, whose hollow was fill'd with a Pithy extended Substance. All which
Parts are also exactly shaped in the Flint, where are visible not only the
long streight Fibers, but the Roots and all the small Fibres of a blackish
transparent Substance, but the Pith in the middle is of a whitish opaque
Substance, and in the most of the small Roots it is hollow; which Mr. <HI>De la
Hire</HI> conceives to proceed from the same Cause that he before assigned.”</P>
<P>“It is evident therefore (says the Author) that this was no <HI>Lusus Naturae,</HI>
but that these two Flints were originally two pieces of the Trunk of a Palm
afterwards chang'd into the Substance of a Flint; and what <HI>Father Duchatz</HI>
reports in his Physical and Mathematical Observations, doth decide the
Controversy, and leaves it without doubt.”</P>
<P>“This Father there says, that the River that passes by <HI>Bakan</HI> in the King∣dom
of <HI>Ava,</HI> has, for the space of ten Leagues, or twenty eight Miles,
the vertue of Petrifying Wood, and that he had seen great Trees Petrify'd
thereby so high as the Surface of the Water reached, but that the other
parts of them remained still dry Wood. He adds, that those Petrify'd
Woods were as hard as the Flints of a Fire-lock; and such indeed was the
ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dness of the two pieces of which we have been speaking.”</P>
<P>“This Account of <HI>Duchatz</HI> is to be found in the Second Volume of Obser∣vations
made in the <HI>Indies</HI> by the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> sent thither by the King of <HI>France,</HI>
but Corrected and Printed by the care of <HI>P. Gouye;</HI> I have not yet seen the
Book, but by the Account of it I find in these Memoires, I conceive it will
be well worth the procuring, as containing many other curious Observations,
and Histories of Matter of Fact.”</P>
<P>This Memoire of Monsieur <HI>De la Hire is much the same with what I have former∣ly
presented to this Honourable Society,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Remarks &amp; De∣ductions from the former Ac∣count.</HI></NOTE> and have Printed among some other Observations
made with <HI>Microscopes,</HI> wherein I examin'd the Shape, the Colour,
the Hardness, the Weight, the Brittleness, the Incumbustibleness, the Soli∣dity,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> of it; for I found it to be for its appearance to the naked Eye, per∣fectly
like a piece of Wood, and to have the visible Grain of Wood, and
farther by a Microscope, I found it to have all the Microscopical Pores like
Wood; I found it of the colour of Wood, but of the hardness of a Flint,
and that it would cut Glass: I found its Weight to be to Water as 3 <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which
seems to be much the same with this of Mr. <HI>De La H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re;</HI> only he compares
its weight to that of the Palm Wood, which, by his description, must be
much lighter than Water, and mine was only comparative to Water. I found
it incumbustible in the Fire, tho' dissolvable by corrosive Liquors. I found it
Brittle and Friable like a Flint, and to feel cold to the touch, as a Stone, or
Mineral Body usually doth; from all which I concluded it to have, at first,
been a piece of Wood, and afterwards, by some Petri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying Water or Va∣pour,
converted into the Substance of a Stone or Flint. And I find that
from the very same Arguments, the <HI>French Academy</HI> draw the same Conclusions
as to this Substance, and they confirm it by the Observation of <HI>P. Dumchatz;</HI>
this therefore passing there for a good Argument, I see no reason why it may
not also be a good Argument here, and why the same will not also pass for the
Petrifactions of other Bodies both Vegetable, as Leaves, Fruits, Roots, and
also Animal, as Shells, Bones, Teeth, Scales, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are found to have
the same Qualifications, that is, the Shapes, Colours, Textures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of
those animate Substances, nay, and often times the very Bodies themselves
not Petrify'd, tho' included in Petrify'd Bodies, as Stones or Minerals; must
these be questioned or rejected, only because such Substances are found in
places where we cannot give particular Histories of their pristine Estate, and
how they come to be there placed and transformed, or so inclosed, or because
<PB N="449" REF="428"/>
possibly we are not able to produce patterns of Creatures now at hand, and
in being, which are exactly of the same Shape and Magnitude as the Acade∣my
did produce, to Authorize, or at least incline them to be of that Senti∣ment;
certainly the same Argument that is cogent for the one, ought not
to be less valid for the other; for if the finding of Coines, Medals, Urnes,
and other Monuments of famous Persons, or Towns, or Utensils, be ad∣mitted
for unquestionable Proofs, that such Persons or things have, in for∣mer
Times, had a being, certainly those Petrifactions may be allowed to be
of equal Validity and Evidence, that there have been formerly such Vege∣tables
or Animals. These are truly Authentick Antiquity not to be coun∣terfeited,
the Stamps, and Impressions, and Characters of Nature that are
beyond the Reach and Power of Humane Wit and Invention, and are true
universal Characters legible to all rational Men.</P>
<P>Now, if these are such (as to me they seem to be, notwithstanding I can∣not
tell the time when, or the certain History how, they came to be there
disposed and ordered as they are now found) then certainly it cannot be ir∣rational
to conclude at least, that there have been some precedent means
that have produced these Effects; and that those means have been such, as we
have from Histories and Relations within the times of our own Memory,
Experience and Information, that they have produced much the like, which
tho' they are not exactly the same, nor possibly by much so great and power∣ful
as they must necessarily be granted, that did effect those we now discover;
yet I think it not unreasonable to conceive, that there may have been much
greater and more powerful Agents than those we now have had, yet still of
the same kind, and acted by the same Powers; for if there are now newly
such as have raised, removed, cleft and torn Mountains, have made Lakes, fill'd
and levelled Plains, stopped and turned Rivers, spouted out Sea-water at a
great distance from the Sea; raised the Sea-shore above the Surface of the
Sea and left it dry, with the Fish, and the remainders of them to cover the
Surface of it; at other places to raise the bottom of the Sea, which was many Fa∣thoms
under Water, and place it above the Surface, and many such other
wonderful Effects; then certainly it cannot be unreasonable to suppose, that
there may have been much greater in former Times, whilst the matter was
yet unconsumed and dispers'd up and down in more places, and more Copi∣ously,
and that more Powerful and Effective.</P>
<P>But it is Objected by some, That for such Persons, Places, or Things, of
which we find now the Relicks; we have Histories that tell us what, who,
and when they were; whereas for the other we have no such Histories in
being, nor during the times whereof we have any Histories, can we find a∣ny
parallel Instances that can countenance such Mut<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tions, Changes, and
Catastrophies as are, and must be supposed to solve the Phaenomena. <HI>Greece,
Aegyt, Italy, Spain</HI> and <HI>France</HI> have continued the same; no new Lands have
been raised out of the Sea, much less Hills or Mountains. Besides, there
are many of those Bodies that we now find, both Animal and Vegetable Substances,
that are as perfectly like the Species of those supposed Creatures now
is being; and therefore we are not to suppose, that any Species could be ut∣terly
destroyed, which yet that Supposition, seems to make necessary, if well
consider'd, and the Consequences thereof produced.</P>
<P>To which I Answer, First, That tho' we have no true History, when, or
by whom, or by what means the <HI>Pyramids</HI> of <HI>Aegypt</HI> were built, yet all that
have seen them do conclude that they were built by Men, and that those
Men were good Masons and Architects and Engineers; and that they were
not produced of that Shape or Magnitude, by a <HI>Vegetative Power,</HI> or by a
<HI>Plastick Faculty, or by meer chance, or the accidental concurrence of Petrifactive
Atoms.</HI> Nor can I see any reason to conclude, that the vast <HI>Obelisks</HI> that
have been transported from place to place, and erected, were so ordered
by Conjureing or Diabolical Magick, tho' I may not be able to tell by what
means they become so ordered; I should rather be inclin'd to believe that
they were so made and placed by the Industry, and Invention, of some know∣ing
and ingenious Mechanick, who had some Contrivances to perform his un∣dertaking
that I am ignorant of. Nor do we make it an Argument that these
<PB N="450" REF="429"/>
<HI>Pyramids</HI> were never made by Men, because no History does tell us when
the like have been made since. Besides, I conceive it would have been a ve∣ry
absurd Conclusion, if any one should have asserted that those Horns, I lately
mention'd here, were a <HI>Lusus Naturae,</HI> and not the parts of any living Ani∣mal,
because he could not tell of what Creature they were; or if he should
have concluded that the Species of the Creature that produced them were
lost, because he knew not where to find it. Certainly there are many <HI>Species</HI>
of Nature that we have never seen, and there may have been also many such
<HI>Species</HI> in former Ages of the World that may not be in being at present,
and many variations of those <HI>Species</HI> now, which may not have had a Being in
former Times: We see what variety of <HI>Species,</HI> variety of Soils and Climates,
and other Circumstantial Accidents do produce; and a <HI>Species</HI> transplanted
and habituated to a new Soil, doth seem to be of another kind, tho' possibly it
might return again to its first Constitution, if restored to its first former Soil.</P>
<P>But I say again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Conclusion.</NOTE> that we have, since the times wherein Histories have been
Written, many Instances of the like Changes and Catastrophies, as I have suppos'd
to be the necessary Consequences of this Theory of Petrifaction, and several so
lately, that the sound of them is hardly out of our Ears; so that we need not be
beholding to antient Historians, to tell us when and where they have actually
been produced; for first there is no place in the Earth that we do know, nor
can we indeed know any such, that is now and ever has been exempt and free
from such Mutations, as I have supposed; who can tell what part of it hath
ever been and ever will be exempt and free from Earthquakes? And tho'
Histories should inform us that during the times of which they writ, there
had been no such Crisis of Nature (which yet would be a very improbable Asser∣tion
as being a Negative) yet it were impossible to be assured by them, that
there had never been any before that time, nor never would be for the fu∣ture.</P>
<P>And, Secondly, There is no impossibility in the Supposition that every part
hath, at some time or other, beeu shaken, overturned, or some way or o∣ther
subject to Earthquakes, and transformed by them; and when we consi∣der
how great a part of the preceeding Time has been <HI>adelon,</HI> or unknown,
and unrecorded, one may easily believe that many Changes may have hap∣pened
to the Earth, of which we can have no written History or Accounts.
And to me it seems very absurd to conclude, that from the beginning things
have continued in the same state that we now find them, since we find every
thing to change and vary in our own remembrance; certainly 'tis a vain thing
to make Experiments and collect Observations, it when we have them, we
may not make use of them; if we must not believe our Senses, if we may not
judge of things by Trials and sensible Proofs, if we may not be allowed to
take notice of and to make necessary Consectaries and Corollaries, but must
remain tied up to the Opinions we have received from others, and disbelieve
every thing, tho' never so rational, if our received. Histories doth not confirm
them; this will be truly <HI>Jurare in verba Magistri,</HI> and we should have no more
to do but to learn what they have thought fit to leave us: But this is contra∣ry
to the <HI>Nullius in verba</HI> of this Society, and I hope that sensible Evidence
and Reason may at length prevail against Prejudice, and that <HI>Libertas P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilo∣sophandi</HI>
may at last produce a true and real Philosophy.</P>

<P><HI>NAVIGATION</HI> is a passing from place to place upon the Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> by
the help of some Vessel; so that to <HI>Navigation,</HI> the first thing ne∣cessary
is the Vessel or Engine to Float or Swim upon the Water,
to the end that it may be moved to the Place, and by the way we
design.</P>
<P>For this there are requisite two helps; First, Somewhat to move it: And,
Secondly, Somewhat to guide or direct that Motion; in the supply of which
two in all particulars to the best advantage, consists the Art of <HI>Naviga∣tion.</HI></P>
<P>Of the first of the Three, namely, of the <HI>Ship,</HI> or of the Form, Structure,
or Make of the Vessel, much more may be said and done than has been hither∣to,
but I shall say nothing at this time, it being a particular Mechanical Art,
and so more proper for another Occasion, where I may have Reason to treat
more largely and more particularly of it. Nor shall I at all meddle now with
the Second Head, namely, concerning the ways of giving Motion to the
Vessel, which may be by various means performed, either by Animate or In∣animate
Movers; but the most commonly used are either Sails by the help of
the Wind, or Oares, by the strength of Men. Tho' there may be other Ways
and Means (much more Advantageous and Commodious than what are at
present) made use of for the same purpose, as possibly I may afterwards ma∣nifest.</P>
<P><PB N="452" REF="431"/>
The principal Matter I here design to treat of, is concerning the Third
thing requisite to the Art of <HI>Navigation,</HI> and that is the way of guiding or
directing a Ship or Vessel, so as to pass from Place to Place, or from Port to
Port the nearest,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Author's chief design in this Treatise,</HI> viz. <HI>The Theo∣vical part.</HI></NOTE> surest, safest, and speediest way: In doing of which I shall
not meddle with the Mechanical Part, or the Business of the Mariner or
Steers-man, or he that guides and moves the Rudder to Kun or Steer the
Ship in this or that Course or Rumb, that being more properly taught and
learnt at Sea by Practice; but shall confine my self only to the <HI>Theorical</HI> part,
which is proper to the <HI>Pilot</HI> or <HI>Master,</HI> who directs the Steers-man, what
Course to take, and which way to Steer the Vessel.</P>
<P>Things necessary to be known in this part of <HI>Navigation</HI> are principally
two; First,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Two things to be known.</HI></NOTE> The true Situation of places in respect of one another, and of
the interjacent Seas, both as to the <HI>Longitude</HI> and <HI>Latitude,</HI> and thence the
<HI>Rumb</HI> and <HI>Distance.</HI></P>
<P>And, Secondly, The safest and nearest Course (all things considered) that
is to be kept for attaining the desired Port; for the most direct Course and
shortest distance is not always the best way, but that way which is safest,
that has the best and surest helps of Winds and Currents, is least endangered
by Rocks, Shoals and Storms.</P>
<P>For both those in part, but for the first wholly we must at present be be∣holding
to the Discovery and Observations that have been made by diligent
and inquisitive Navigators, and other Artists, who have been assistant to the
making and rectifying our Maps and Charts, which tho' they may labour un∣der
many Errors and Imperfections, yet 'tis to be hoped that the Industry of
ingenious and skillful Artists may much amend and rectify those Failings, and
reduce the Descriptions to a much greater certainty and exactness; and in
time give us such Maps, as may be a true Picture or Representation of the
Surface of the Earth and Sea, which is the first principal thing. I need not
Instance in the great Errors that are to be found in our present Maps, nor
in the Discrepancy they have one with another;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Errors in the present Sea Chartes.</NOTE> since none that has been a∣ny
way conversant in them can be ignorant thereof: However such as they
are we must be content to make use of them, 'till by the collected Observa∣tions
of some that have already communicated their Knowledge, and others
that may for the future labour in this Work, there be a compleater set of
Mapps and Charts Graved and Published a-new for the Benefit of Mankind.
For the doing of which I could suggest many things that would very much
improve their usefulness, both as to <HI>Geography,</HI> and <HI>Hydrography,</HI> or <HI>Navigati∣on;</HI>
of which I shall say more hereafter upon another occasion.</P>
<P>Secondly, The other part is partly Theorical, and party Historical.</P>
<P>The Historical Part consists in the Relations of Voyages that have been, or
are now made to any known Part, wherein we may find an account or
what Course they have hitherto observed to be the best to be kept from place
to place, what Seasons of the Year, what Currents are to be met with, and
at what times; what Winds blow at certain Places and Seasons, what safe
and convenient Harbours lie in the way for Victualling, Watering, Careen∣ing,
and the like: What Sands, Rocks, Shoals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are to be avoided;
what variation they have found of the Compass at this or that part of their
Course, or Ports they have touched at, and at what times they were observed
because of the continual Variation of the Variation; what ligns they have of
ensuing Storms, and what methods they have used to secure themselves; and
many other of the like Nature—. And it were much to be desired that the
Journals and Observations of all Navigators were in some certain place re∣tained
and preserved,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The use of Journals</HI></NOTE> that Recourse might thereto be had for extracting and
methodizing all such Observations into a compleat History of such particular
Voyages, and for the compleating a general Theory. For tho' many consi∣derable
things are Known to divers skillful Navigators to those parts, partly
from their own Observations, and partly from the informations they have
had from others, yet a very great number of Observations and Methods, that
have been formerly and lately known and observed by divers others, have
been lost and forgotten, and are not now to be found. And to speak of
Artists now living, 'tis to be feared that even those things which they them∣selves
<PB N="453" REF="432"/>
know, when they Die, will be lost, and others that shall follow them,
will be fain to begin upon a new score with their own Observations; several
of those may possibly be handed from one to another by Discourse and oral
Tradition; but that at best must needs be very imperfect, since we find that
Men themselves forget in a little time their own Observations, and this or
that particular Circumstance will slip out of their Memory, especially in mat∣ters
of number; and certainly there could be no better way to preserve them
for future Use, than by treasuring them up in some one certain place, where
they might be safely preserved: And it were as much for the observers In∣terest.
so to do, since it would put him upon observing as well as upon writ∣ing
his Observations, and 'twould prompt him to recollect things taken no∣tice
of, whilst the impressions of them are yet fresh in his Memory, by which
means he would not only fix them more lastingly in his own Memory; but it
would be an occasion to him of making. his Observations much more certain
and determinate, and of minding many other considerable Circumstances,
which he would otherwise not at all have regarded; as any one that makes
trial will easily be convinced of; this therefore, we hope, Time may pro∣duce.</P>
<P>The Theorical Part, which is that I aim principally to Discourse of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Theor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> part.</NOTE> is a
knowledge or Art, by which Directions are obtained for Guiding and Steer∣ing
a Vessel from any one place to any other, whereof we have the Situation
given and all the material Circumstances, that have been taken notice of to
be usually met with in, Voyages made to those Parts; for 'tis with Voyages at
Sea oftentimes as it is in Journies upon the Land, that the farthest way about is
oft times the nearest way thither: The cause of which, in Sea Voyages, is to
be ascribed either to the Winds or to the Currents and Tides; of which I
shall say more hereafter. And tho' the general Theory would direct you to
Sail or Steer by the shortest and straightest way through the open and free
Sea from one place to another, yet the intervening of these and some other
Circumstances do make you take a very differing Course, and go sometimes
this way, and sometimes that way, for the better attaining your end. As
when they Sail to the <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> they do not Steer on the direct Rumb that
leads thither, but Sail a-way more towards the South, that they may get in∣to
the Trade or Easterly Winds, which may carry them from thence more
directly and speedily towards their Port; whereas in the direct Rumb they
meet with Calms or contrary Winds and Currents, which would take up
much more Time, and cause much greater inconvenience; 'tis plain there∣fore,
that both these parts are necessary, <HI>viz.</HI> First, True Charts of the Si∣tuition
of Places: And, Secondly, A true History of the Conveniences and
Inconveniences of passing by this or that Course.</P>
<P>For the first of these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For knowing the Situatier of piaces.</NOTE> namely, for the knowing of the true Situation of
Places to one another, it is requisite to understand, First, the Figure of the
Body of the Earth: And, Secondly, The Magnitude. Concerning the Fi∣gure
of the Earth; there have been very many, and those very differing O∣pinions
among the ancient Philosophers, but whether their Opinions are tru∣ly
related to us, or whether they had any Grounds or Reasons for those O∣pinions
we are uncertain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Terra∣queous Figure, the Opinions of the Antients.</NOTE> because little is said concerning them. <HI>Anaximan∣der</HI>
is said to have supposed it like a Column; tho' yet consdering his skill in
Astronomy, 'tis hardly to be believed. <HI>Leucippus</HI> like a Cylinder or Drum.
<HI>Cleanthes</HI> like a top or double Cone, whose Points were at the Poles as some
say; but others, that he supposed it like a Dish, hollowed in the middle, but
rising towards the Edges, that the Sea might not run over, of which Opini∣on
<HI>Heraclitus</HI> is also said to be. <HI>Anaximenes</HI> and <HI>Empedocles</HI> are said to have
supposed it like a round Table, or a round Plain, being the top, as it. were,
of a mighty Cylinder or Column, for the bottom of which, they assigned no
bounds; of which <HI>Aristotle</HI> in his Book <HI>De Caelo,</HI> and <HI>Plutarch De Placitis Phi∣losophorum</HI>
give an account. Of this Opinion are most Men who are ignorant
in Astronomy and Geography, and that because the visible appearance, they
always have of the Earth, is a very large Plain covered with the Heavens as
with a Hemisphere, and because the Land was always bounded by the Sea,
and that the Limits or Bounds of that Sea was not known, it was supposed
<PB N="454" REF="433"/>
that the Sea was bounded by the hollow Hemisphere of Heaven, and thence
that the Sun, Moon and Stars that Rose and Set, did rise out of the Sea,
and set or descend again into the Sea, which was the occasion and ground of
those Expressions and Fables of the antient Poets; and even to this day igno∣rant
People, that have been no better informed, are from the same Cause, as
I have already mention'd of the same Opinion; for this cause also it was,
that some were of Opinion, that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or the whole of the World was Wa∣ter,
and that there was a kind of Arch or Firmament of Heaven, which
kept off the Waters that were above this Arch from coming to the Waters
which were beneath the Arch, upon which the Earth floated, as it were a
Dish; and that beneath the Earth that kept up the Waters above, was the
space, wherein the Air and Meteors were placed—. This also was much
countenanced by the visible appearances both of the Earth and the Heavens,
and so needs not much of Arguments to make it pass with the Vulgar and Il∣literate,
and such as have not been used to consider and reason about these
Matters. Hence comes it, that even to this Day, we may every where find
People who retain as absurd Imaginations, and who still look upon Antipo∣des
as impossible Fictions, and the Product only of the Authority of Sea∣men
and Travellers to tell strange things; nor has it been only the Opinion
of the Vulgar and Illiterate, but even of many otherwise very Learned and
Excellent Men, such as were several Fathers of the Church, who, from their
want of this sort of Knowledge, and from their misunderstanding some Texts
of the Scripture, have zealously opposed the Opinion of the roundness of the
Earth and of Antipodes.</P>
<P><HI>Parmenides,</HI> among the Antients, is said by <HI>Diogenes Laertius,</HI> to be the first
that ever asserted the Earth to be a round Ball or Globe, and seated In the
middle of the World, and the first, that set out or limited the habitable Parts
of the World, and bounded them by the Frozen <HI>Zone</HI> on the one side, and
the Torrid or Burning <HI>Zone</HI> one the other side, as is related of him by <HI>Plu∣tarch</HI>
in his Treatise <HI>De placitis Philosophorum:</HI> This Man flourished in the six∣ty
nineth <HI>Olympiad,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of an antient learned Age.</NOTE> that is, about five Hundred Years before <HI>Christ.</HI> But tho'
this Person were an extraordinary Philosopher and great discoverer of Na∣ture,
and so might possibly receive this Opinion, yet we find by the fore-men∣tioned
Book of <HI>Plutarch,</HI> that this Opinion is ascribed to <HI>Thales,</HI> who lived a∣bove
a Hundred Years sooner; and if we had not been defective in the Hi∣story
of antient Times, without doubt we should have been informed that
Astronomy and the Theory of the World, revived by <HI>Copernicus,</HI> was, long
before <HI>Thales,</HI> well known, and if so, then the roundness of the Body of the
Earth could not be a thing unknown to so learned an Age; of which learn∣ed
Age, beyond all the Histories now to be met with, <HI>Hugo Grotius</HI> has given
us a Collection of <HI>Testimonies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Simplicius</HI> in his Notes upon <HI>Aristotle,</HI> mentions, that <HI>Calisthenes</HI> (who upon
the taking of <HI>Babylon</HI> was presented by <HI>Aristotle</HI> to <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great) had
several very antient Writings of Astronomers very long before that time,
namely, of 1903 Years, which, according to the common Account, must fall
about threescore Years after the Flood, and consequently, if Astronomy were
so early so well known, the Figure of the Earth could not be unknown; for
whatever strange Opinions some of the Philosophers might have, who had on∣ly
contemplated some of the lesser Bodies and Productions of Nature which
were within their reach, yet most certainly those that were skillful in Astro∣nomy
could not be ignorant of its Form, which we may plainly enough
prove from their assigning the Eclipses of the Moon to be from the shadow
of the Earth; but especially if the System of <HI>Aristarchus</HI> were so very anti∣ent,
wherein the Earth is supposed a Planet.</P>
<P>But to omit any further mention of the Opinions or Theories of the Anti∣ents concerning the Figure of the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Sphaeri∣cal Figurr of the Earth.</NOTE> it is now supposed or granted by
all Philosophers, Astronomers, and Geographers, that the Figure of the Bo∣dy
of the Earth is Globular, or every way equally round, or of a Sphaerical
Figure, and accordingly the Model of it is commonly made of that Figure, a
Globe, and the Parts or places of it are set down and described upon the
Superficies of a perfect Globe, and so the distances from place to place are
<PB N="455" REF="434"/>
computed as upon such a Sphaerical or bending Surface; and many Arguments
are commonly brought to prove this Opinion, which, because they are to be
met with in almost every Geographical Writer, I shall pass by at present;
some only I would here take notice of, that tho' it be so generally assented to,
and concluded by all, yet I conceive there is no one positive and undeniable
Proof to evince it against some I have lately met with, who would have it to
be somewhat of an Oval or Egg-like Figure, the Axis of its motion being
supposed the longest Diameter;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Oval Fi∣gure thereof.</NOTE> or of another, who supposes it may be of an
Oval Figure the contrary way, and that the longest Diameter of it is the Ae∣quinoctial,
and the shortest the Axis; the reason of the first was alledged to
be, for that the Sun does exhale and draw up into the Air from the parts of the
<HI>Torrid Zone</HI> a great quantity of Water and other volatile Materials from it
into the Air, and drive them towards the two Polar Parts, where they again
praecipitate and falldown in Rain, Snows, Hails, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and so turn to Ice, and
so raise the parts thereof towards the Pole, and diminish the parts about the
<HI>Torrid Zone:</HI> But the Answer to this Argument is very casy, that if the
Water be most raised within the <HI>Torrid Zone</HI> and rain'd down again in the Fri∣gid,
then it would follow, that there must be a continual passage of Water
from the Frigid towards the Torrid, and possibly it must carry more parts a∣long
with it in its return towards the Aequinoctial in the Form of Water, than
from the <HI>Torrid Zone</HI> back to the Frigid in the form of Air: This therefore
will be a better Argument for the second Hypothesis than for the first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What the Au∣thor mentions here of the O∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Figure, is more largely <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed of and demonstrated Page 355. Supra.</NOTE> but
'tis judged no positive and certain Argument for either, since what it carries
back towards the Aequinoctial, serves only to fill up the Caverns in the bot∣tom
of the Sea: The Argument alledged for the second Opinion, was, that
the Globe of the Earth being whirled round upon its Axis, the parts near
the Aequinoctial have less Gravity than the Parts near the Poles; but tho'
this be more significant than the former, yet it may be said that the Body of
the Sun, tho' it be moved upon its Axis as well as the Body of the Earth, yet
the Figure thereof, as far as we can discover by the Telescope, is still per∣fectly
round. Now the proportion of the Diameter of the Sun to the Dia∣meter
of the Earth being greater than the period of the Sun's Revolution to
the Period of the Earth's; it follows that the parts of the Sun move swifter
than the respective parts of the Body of the Earth. Now, tho' it be alledg∣ed
that the Body of <HI>Mercury</HI> passing through the Body of the Sun in the last
Conjunction observed by Montieur <HI>Gallet,</HI> was by him said to appear of this
Figure, yet no such appearance was taken notice of by others that observed
the same; and if it had, 'tis not yet known whether <HI>Mercury</HI> be moved round
upon its Axis or not, and therefore no certain conclusion can thence be de∣duced
But as neither of these Assertions is sufficiently proved, so I must
needs say that the absolute round ness of the Ball of the Earth does yet want a
positive Proof; for no one of the Arguments or Experiments, yet brought to
prove that Figure, are sufficiently exact and positive to prove it; for tho'
they do most of them prove it to have a Figure which is near a round, yet
they do not prove it absolutely; for First, It cannot certainly enough be dis∣covered
by the Eclipses of the Moon; for the shadow may be somewhat El∣liptical
either way, and yet the appearances not sufficient to determine the
difference; for we find that no Observation hitherto made doth exactly agree
with any Calculation yet made; and to what to ascribe the difference is not
hitherto agreed. Next, none of the measures of a Degree, tho' some of them,
as particularly that of the <HI>French</HI> lately Published by the <HI>Royal Academy,</HI> are
made with great exactness, for each of them only shew what measure was
found of a Degree of the Meridian in that Latitude; but they differ enough
one from another to shew that no two of them compared together will be
sufficient for this purpose. Further, tho' two of them should pretty
near agree, as that of Mr. <HI>Norwood</HI> here in <HI>England,</HI> and that of Mr. <HI>Picart,</HI>
yet to make them significant for this purpose, the same examinations should
have been made Eastward and Westwards, to see whether the Parallels Would
have answered to the respective Latitudes; and therefore if these Proofs be
not sufficient, much less will the Observation of Seamen, whose computations
of Leagues failed, are by no means accurate enough to determine this mat∣ter;
<PB N="456" REF="435"/>
for there may be a considerable difference, and yet they unable to detect
it.</P>
<P>Against this the most material Objection is, that if the Body of the Earth
should be Elliptical,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Objection a∣gainst the El∣liptical Figure.</NOTE> as there is some probability that it is so, not with the
longest Diameter in the Axis, which would make it of an Egg form, but
with the longest Diameter, in the plain of the Aequinoctial, which would make
it of a Turnep or Bowl Form, and that because the Rotation thereof must
necessarily make the parts of the Earth, which are carried the swiftest with
that motion, have an indeavour outwards, or from the Axis of Rotation, as
we find in all Bodies moved with such a motion; which indeavour must neces∣sarily
take off from the Gavitation of those Bodies towards the Center, and
thence if the power of Gravitation be every ways from the Center equally
forcing towards the Center, the parts of the Earth towards the Aequinoctial
must have less Gravity than the parts of the Earth that are nearer the Poles;
and consequently there must be a longer Cone or Cylinder near the Aequi∣noctial
to counterpoise a shorter near the Poles, and consequently to keep the
Water of the Sea in a Counterpoise, there must be a rising of the Sea above
the Sphaerical Surface near the
Aequinoctial, and a depression of the Sea below
that Sphaerical Surface near the Poles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">From the point∣ing of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣pendicular.</NOTE> which makes it of this Turnep or Bowl
shape. Against this, I say, the greatest Objection is this, either the Perpen∣dicular
doth point directly to the Center of the Earth, or it doth not: If
it be asserted that it points directly to the Center of the Earth, then the
Surface or the visible Horizon would discover such a variation from perfect
Sphaericalness by an obliquity of its plain to the Plumb Line, which then would
not be Perpendicular to it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Answered.</NOTE> To which I Answer, that this Obliquity being
but little, it would not easily be discovered by reason of the Refraction of
the Air near the Horizon, yet if it really be so, I grant it may with great
care be found, if a place convenient for such an Observation, and the Expe∣riment
be purposely and with great care made, as at some promontory of Land
running Eastward or Westward into the Sea, where the Surface of the Sea or
the Horizon thereof may be seen both to the North and to the South. But
this I do not find has ever yet been observed as it ought to be, and therefore
there may be such an appearance, and yet not hitherto detected. But, Se∣condly,
If it be asserted that if the Plumb-Line do not point to the Center,
then this would be discovered by the different account of Leagues failed East
and West, from the Leagues failed North and South, to answer to a Degree,
or by the differing length or a Degree in differing Latitudes; to which I An∣swer,
that I do confess that there would be really such a difference, but yet I
say no Observation hitherto made could detect it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Accurate Ob∣servations are yet wanting.</NOTE> there are wanting therefore
many Observations necessary for the verifying and positively demonstrating this
Question, which, tho' it has scare been ever yet mentioned by any Writer,
yet I judge it may be well worth the while to have it exactly tried and exa∣mined;
for tho' it hath been generally believed and asserted, that the Fi∣gure
of the Earth is exactly Sphaerical or Globular, yet I assert that there is
not one, that I have ever yet met with, that has proved or demonstrated it so
to be; and to me it seems very probable from some Physical Considerations,
that it may be considerably otherwise; of which I have discoursed much more
largely on another Subject, wherein I have shewn the necessary Consequences,
and the several Proprieties thereof, which are much differing from the No∣tions
hitherto commonly received.</P>
<P>However probable it is, that 'tis pretty near the Sphaerical Figure, and
therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earth pretty nearly of a Sphaerical Figure.</NOTE> 'till it be some ways found to be otherwise, the computation of di∣stances
may be so made as if it had been positively proved so to be, and the
measures of distances made accordingly; which brings me to the second neces∣sary
to be known, and that is the true Magnitude of the Body of the Earth
compared to the common known measures, as that of a Foot, Pace, Fathom,
Stadium, Mile, League, or the like.</P>
<P>For this then we have an account of very many Experiments and Trials
that have been made both heretofore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The meas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of a Degree a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpted by se∣veral of the Antients and Modern<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> and of later Days; but if we compare
them together, one would be apt to imagine, either that they were very im∣perfectly
made, or else that we are very ignorant of their several particular
<PB N="457" REF="436"/>
measures, or else that there may be a real difference of the measure of a De∣gree
taken at several Latitudes of the Earth; for <HI>Aristotle</HI> makes it 1111 Sta∣dia,
<HI>Eratosthenes</HI> 700, <HI>Possidonius</HI> 666, and <HI>Ptolomy</HI> 500, and the <HI>Arabians</HI> yet
less; but in truth we know not what ways they took for exactness, nor what
measure any of them made use of compared with those in use at present a∣mong
us; and therefore it will be much less difficult not to err our selves, than
to know whether the Antients err'd or no.</P>
<P>If we consider the Modern Experiments for this purpose, we may find that
Mr. <HI>Norwood</HI> in the Year 1635, did find the Meridian Altitude of the Sun
on the eleventh of <HI>June</HI> to be 59, 33#, and that two Years before that, <HI>viz.</HI> on
the eleventh of <HI>June</HI> 1633, he had found the Meridian Altitude of the Sun at
<HI>London</HI> 62° 01#, whence he concludes (not making any allowance for declina∣tion,
Refraction, or Parallax) that <HI>York</HI> was more <HI>North</HI> than <HI>London</HI> 2, 28.
Now by measuring the distance by Chains of ninty nine Foot long, or six Rod
of 16 ½ to a Rod, he found it to be 9149 Chains, or 905751 Feet; whence
he concludes in a Degree there are 367196 or 367200 Feet, which is sixty nine
Miles and an half and 236 Feet, whence there will be 6120 Feet in one Mi∣nute
or a gradual Mile, which is 840 Foot more than our Statute Mile which
is 5280 Foot.</P>
<P>The last Experiment that has been made for determining this measure, is
that of Monsieur <HI>Picart,</HI> and the Gentlemen of the <HI>Royal Academy of Paris,</HI> who
with great exactness of Instruments and great Skill and Care in performing,
examin'd the measure of a Degree and found the same to be 57060 Toises or
Fathoms of the Castle of <HI>Paris,</HI> each Fathom or Toise containing six Parisian
Feet, and thence a Degree contains 342360 Parisian Feet; and the Parisian
Foot being to that of <HI>London</HI> as 16 to 15, a Degree will contain 365184 <HI>En∣glish</HI>
Feet, or 69 Miles and 864 Feet; which is almost 1/6 part of a Mile, a
sixth part of a Mile being 880 Feet, so that by this Account a Degree is less
than what Mr. <HI>Norwood</HI> makes it by 2012 Feet, and consequently a Minute
or gradual Mile will contain 6086 1/5 Feet, which is longer than a Statute
Mile 806 2/5 Foot, which is almost a Sixth, <HI>viz.</HI> 880. Now having the mea∣sure
of one Degree, it will be easy to find the measure of the Circumference
of the whole Earth, there being 360 such Degrees in a great Circle of it. 360
times 365184 gives 13156624<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Feet in the Circumference of the Earth, or
24915 Miles and 5<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4 Feet.</P>
<P>These two last Mensurations are less than that which was made by the
<HI>Arabians</HI> about the Year of our Lord 827 by several skilful Mathematicians
at the command of <HI>Almaiman</HI> an <HI>Arabian</HI> Prince, in the Plains of <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI>
they finding a measure of a Degree, which, reduced to our <HI>English</HI> Measure,
amounted to 370222 Feet; so that That of Mr. <HI>Norwood</HI> is less by 3022 Feet,
and that of Mr. <HI>Picart</HI> 5238; so that <HI>Norwood</HI> is less by about 1 1/2<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> part of a
Degree, or about half a Minute, and <HI>Picart</HI> is less by a 72 1/2 part of a Degree,
or almost an <HI>English</HI> Mile.</P>
<P>What to ascribe the Reason of these differences one from another to, is pret∣ty
hard to say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To what their Discrepancy may be ascrib'd and of the dif∣ference of mea∣sures.</NOTE> but most probably it is partly the differing method each of
them took, and partly also the uncertainty of the comparative Magnitude of
the measures they each of them made use of; for to go no farther back than
Mr. <HI>Norwood,</HI> we are not well assured but that the Foot he made use of was
less than the Foot we now make use of by 181 1/2 part by which he differs from <HI>Pi∣cart,</HI>
which is about half a Centesm; for the Standard Foot we now use was since
that time agreed upon by a Club of our Mathematical Instrument-makers, of
whom Mr. <HI>Elias Allen</HI> was the chief; we will not now mention any other
cause, tho' possibly there may be another more considerable than either But
not to trouble our selves with what the measure of a Degree has been, 'tis on∣ly
necessary for our present Enquiry to know what really it is now, reduced
to a known and certain and invariable measure, in which all Nations may a∣gree;
for 'till that be done,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Logline at present leads, into errors.</NOTE> our measuring the Course at Sea by the Logline
is false and leads into great Errors and Mistakes; for if with the Logline
we measure a League, or the 60th part of a Degree, and account it to hold
but 15840 Foot, or 2640 Fathom, and it really contains 18259 1/5 Feet, or 3043
Fathoms, then the Course measured by such an erroneous measure must needs
very much confound our reckoning</P>
<P><PB N="458" REF="437"/>
It will be necessary therefore in the first place to rectify our measure and the length of our Line.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of an univer∣sal standard for measure.</NOTE></P>
<P>Many have been the attempts and designs both of Antient and Moderns
to perform this necessary <HI>Praecognitum</HI> to Geography and Mechanicks;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st. The Pen∣dulum propos'd for that end.</NOTE> but to
this Day it remains a thing to be sought after. The last and best way hi∣therto
thought of is, that by the length of a <HI>Pendulum</HI> vibrating Seconds of
Time measured by the Sun's middle motion in the Ecliptick, reduced to the
Aequinoctial or right a ascensum, which, for ought I know, was first invent∣ed
by the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> tho' it has been since published by Monsieur <HI>Hugens,</HI>
Monsieur <HI>Picart,</HI> and divers others. Or which were yet more easy to be found
and more certain, by reason that the Sun's true <HI>Anomaly</HI> is not yet ascertain∣ed
by the length of a <HI>Pendulum</HI> vibrating a Second of Time, by the diurnal Re∣volution
of some notable fixt Star; because, in all probability, that is always e∣qual
and the same at any time of the Year, and in any Year, either past or to
come. And tho' the ingenious <HI>Kepler</HI> has from his Hypothesis of the-turbi∣nating
Power of Light supposed that the turbinating or diurnal Motion of
the Earth upon its Axis is accelerated and retarded in that diurnal Rotation,
according as it moves nearer to, or further off from the Sun; yet there is no
one certain and positive Experiment or Observation yet brought to prove
any such inequality; and from another Hypothesis which I have of the causes
of that motion, which is very differing from that of <HI>Kepler,</HI> I suppose there
can be none such, and therefore 'till by some certain Observation, it be found
to be otherwise, we may, with great Reason, suppose it to be at all times of
the Year, the same; so that if a <HI>Pendulum</HI> be made of such a length as to
make 86400 single vibrations in the time that any fixt Star passes from the
Meridian, 'till it return to the same the next Night, that length may be ta∣ken
for a perpetual measure of length or a Standard Yard, to which all o∣ther
measures of Length, Breadth, Solidity, Capacity, Weight, or Power,
may be reduc'd; and ⅓ of that may be taken for the universal Foot, and two
of those for an universal Fathom, and five of those may make a Rod or Pole;
or which were yet better, to divide this length into ten, for Decimals or
Hands, and each of those into Decimals which may be called Digits or Fin∣gers,
and each of these into Decimals which may be called Threads, and
each of these into Decimals which may be called Clews or Hairs, and so on∣ward
by Decimal-subdivision, to continue downwards, so as you have occa∣sion,
of a smaller or smaller measure, which may be call'd Tenths, Hun∣dreds,
Thousands, ten Thousands, hundred Thousands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and for grea∣ter
measures to compute only by the number of such Yards, Arms, or
Paces.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Hugens</HI> has determined the length of a <HI>Pendulum</HI> vibrating Se∣conds
by the Sun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The length of a Pendulum vibrating Se∣conds.</NOTE> to be three Foot 8 1/6 Lines of the <HI>Parisian</HI> measure, account∣ing
the Limits of his measure so taken, to be from the Center of Suspension, to
the Center of Oscillation or Vibration, which is a Point to be found by a pro∣portion
which he assigns, depending on the length of the Diameter of the
Ball to the length of the String by which it is suspended.</P>
<P>The Toise or Fathom of the Observations of <HI>Paris,</HI> which Monsieur <HI>Picart</HI>
made use of for the measure of a Degree, was, according to the last establish∣ment
at <HI>Paris,</HI> compared with the Standard of the length of a <HI>Pendulum</HI> vi∣brating
Seconds of Time conformable to the mean motion of the Sun.</P>
<P>The Toise contains six Parisian Feet, and the Parisian Foot to the <HI>London</HI>
Foot is in proportion as 16 to 15.—Each of these Parisian Feet is divided
into Duodecimals or Inches, and each Inch into Duodecimals or Lines.</P>
<P>Now, by many trials, he found the length of such a <HI>Pendulum</HI> to be thirty
six Inches, and eight Lines and an half.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pendulum</HI> he used, as he himself declares, was made of a Ball of Copper
of one Inch in Diameter exactly turned, and the first String, he used to sus∣pend
it by, was of a flat Silk. The length of the <HI>Pendulum</HI> he reckons to be from
the Center of Motion to the Center of the Ball, omitting the part proporti∣onal
taken notice of by Mousieur <HI>Hugeus,</HI> the Ball being but a thirty sixth part
of the length of the Thread; otherwise if the Ball be bigger, the proportional
part must be taken notice of as making a considerable variation, the vibrati∣ons
<PB N="459" REF="438"/>
also observ'd were very short, otherwise there would have been a consi∣derable
variation in their Duration or Time, but afterwards finding that the
Silk was apt to shrink and stretch by the least driness and moisture of the Air,
it was found much better for that purpose to make use of a flake of Silk
Grass, which is a sort of long and very fine Flax brought out of <HI>America,</HI>
which is very flexible and yet very strong, and not subject to shrink or stretch.
The upper end of this Flake was put between the Chops of a small Vice which
held it very firm when pinched by the Screw, and the length was measured
by a small Rod of Iron made exactly of the length of the String, when the Ball
hung Perpendicular between the Head of the said Vice and the Ball.</P>
<P>This <HI>Pendulum</HI> was adjusted by two large <HI>Pendulum-Clocks,</HI> whose <HI>Pendulum</HI>
had been by trials adjusted to move Second Minutes by the mean motion of
the Sun, and which were found slower by three Minutes and fifty six Seconds,
at every return of the same Star to the Meridian; and that to such an ex∣actness,
that they differed not one from another, one single Second during
many Days; the Single <HI>Pendulum</HI> was so suspended and put into motion, that
it vibrated the same way as the <HI>Pendulum</HI> of the Clock; and if it were of 36
Inches eight and an half Lines, it continued its Vibrations the same with those
of the Clock, but if it were never so little either longer or shorter than that
measure, it became, in less than an Hours time, sensibly differing; however
he acknowledged that this length was not always found so precise, but that
it seemed it ought to have been a little shortned in Winter and lengthned in
Summer; but that, he conceives, ought to have been but the tenth part of a
Line, and the excess on both sides being pretty near equal, he therefore made
choice of the length of 36 Inches, eight and an half Lines, as the medium or
middle length between that of the Summer and that of the Winter.</P>
<P>Now, if this were made the general Standard for the measures of all Coun∣tries,
or that there particular measures, whatever they be, were reduced to
this, then the knowing the proportion thev bear to the Standard would ma∣nifest
the proportions they have to one another, and so the measures given of
a Degree in one place, by the measures of that Country might easily be re∣duced
to the measures of any other; and so Experiments truly made might
be as accurately examin'd and compar'd together.</P>
<P>But against this way of finding a natural,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Objections a∣gainst this Standard.</NOTE> universal, and perpetual Stand∣ard
measure of length there may be divers Objections not inconsiderable;
as, First, That if the Gravitating Power of the Earth be greater in one place
than in the other, as towards the Poles more than towards the Aequator,
then the length of a <HI>Pendulum</HI> to vibrate Seconds, must also be considerably
longer towards the Poles than towards the Aequinoctial, otherwise the <HI>Pen∣dulum</HI>
of the same length with what is determin'd in <HI>France,</HI> which is about the
middle between the North Pole and the Aequinoctial, will go too quick near
the Poles, and too slow near the Aequinoctial. Now, what I many Years
since discover'd in this place, reading about Penduls for Longitude, and what
I have now before mention'd concerning a probability, if not a necessity of
such an inequality of Gravitation, and cousequently of a Boul-like form of
the Earth, does at least hint that some Experiment of that kind ought to be
try'd at some place near the Aequator, to see whether it be so or not, and 'till
that be done there can be no certain Conclusion made thereupon.</P>
<P>Next, 'tis not impossible but that the Gravity or attractive Power of the
Earth may be at some times greater than at others;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gravity may differ in the same place.</NOTE> for we see that there is
hardly any thing in Nature that stands at a certain stay, but does sometimes
increase and sometimes diminish; and if so, then that Iron Rod, that is the
exact measure of the length of the String of the <HI>Pendulum</HI> this Year, will be
differing from the length of the same, which was three or four Years since,
and may be three or four Years hence; this therefore ought to be first ex∣amin'd
by Experience, before any certain Conclusion can be made there∣upon.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And at differ∣ent seasons.</NOTE> It is not yet certainly known but that the Gravitating Power of
the Earth may be different at various Seasons of the Year, as when the Earth
is in its <HI>Apholion</HI> and <HI>Perihelion;</HI> for which possibly there may be a plausible
Reason assign'd; and if so, it will then be necessary to mention at what time
<PB N="460" REF="439"/>
of the Year the measure is taken; for if the gravitating Power should be found
to be lesser when the Earth is in its <HI>Perihelion</HI> in our Winter, than when in
its <HI>Aphelion</HI> in the Summer, then the <HI>Pendulum</HI> must be accordingly propor∣tion'd to the time of the Year.</P>
<P>Fourthly, If the Rotation or Diurnal Motion of the Earth should be ac∣celerated
in its <HI>Perihelion</HI> in our Winter, and retarded in its <HI>Aphetion</HI> in our
Summer, as the ingenious <HI>Kepler</HI> supposes, and seems to assert from Experi∣ments,
then the quite contrary will follow, and the <HI>Pendulum</HI> must be shorter
for the Winter than for the Summer; which will be necessary to be prov'd by
trials, before any thing can be built thereupon.</P>
<P>Fifthly, If both these two last mention'd Effects are produc'd, and that
they keep in some proportion one to another, then a <HI>Pendulum</HI> of the same
length may serve at all Seasons of the Year; but if either exceed the other in
that proportion, then must the length of the <HI>Pendulum</HI> be accordingly
lengthen'd or shortn'd.</P>
<P>Sixthly, If the differing Density of the Air have an influence upon the Mo∣tion
and Velocity of the <HI>Pendulum</HI> made in it, as most certainly it has, and
that a Body in a dense Air moves not so quick, <HI>Caeteris paribus,</HI> as in a rarify'd
Air, then the <HI>Pendulum</HI> must be shorten'd in the Winter, and lengthen'd in
the Summer; and so the same measure will not last round the Year.</P>
<P>Seventhly, If the <HI>Pendulum</HI> be made of a Brass, Silver, or Iron Rod, then
the length of the same Rod will be greater in Summer than in Winter, and
consequently the space measur'd therewith will be found shorter in Summer
than in Winter; for those and the other Metals, when hot, will have larger
Dimensions than when cold, and so cannot make an exact Standard for the
measure of length.</P>
<P>Eighthly, If the <HI>Pendulum</HI> be made with twisted Threads, then the Threads
will be found to be longer in dry Weather than in moist, and so 'twill be neces∣sary
to take an account of the Seasons when the Experiments are made, and
to reduce to exactness the limits of such shrinking and stretching.</P>
<P>I could mention divers other Objections against this way, tho' notwith∣standing
I conceive it to be the best and easiest that has been yet Publish'd;
and with finding out the true limitations to all those Qualifications, it may
possibly prove the best for use.</P>
<P>There have been others who have thought the best way for the making an
universal Standard for the measuring of length,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Degree pro∣pos'd for an u∣niversal Stand∣ard.</NOTE> to be the finding the exact
length of a Degree upon the Earth; and to do that by most exactly determin∣ing
two places upon the Earth that are both in the same <HI>Meridian,</HI> and differ
from each other exactly one Degree of Latitude, observ'd by a very large and
curious Instrument; which places being so found out, their true distance is to
be exactly measur'd and found some one certain measure; then this length, to
be divided into sixty equal Parts, which may be called Geographical Miles or
Minutes, and each sixtieth part being subdivided into a thousand parts, may
denote Geographical Paces, and each thousanth part, being again subdivided
into five parts, may denote a Geographical Foot, and each of these fifth parts
being again subdivided into twelve, may denote Geographical Inches; and
these again subdivided into twelve parts, may denote Geographical Lines;
and so subdividing onward by Duodecimals the least sensible length may be
determin'd in proportion to the Circumference or Diameter of the Earth.</P>
<P>But against this way of making a Standard for the measure of length there
may be these things Objected; First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Objections a∣gainst this way</NOTE> The great difficulty that there will be,
First, To determine exactly by Astronomical Observation two such places to
the certainty of five Hundred Foot. Secondly, In measuring their true di∣stance.</P>
<P>Secondly, If the Body of the Earth be not exactly Sphaerical, then the mea∣sure
of a Degree, taken in one Latitude, will be differing from what it is
in another, and so it must be determin'd, First, By trials exactly made in
differing Latitudes, whether any such difference be or not, before any Conclu∣sion can be made thereupon.</P>
<P><PB N="461" REF="440"/>
Thirdly, 'Tis not improbable but that the Body of the Earth itself may
shrink and grow closer together, and so grow lesser, that the Gravity thereof
does continually press the parts thereof harder, and possibly closer together;
and so 'tis possible the irregular Surface of the Earth may have been, in part,
caus'd by the puckering of the Cortical Parts thereof; and if so, then the
measures, this way found, will every Age grow shorter and shorter; which,
possibly, may have been the Reason why the measures of a Degree, which
have been taken in several Ages, have always been found shorter and shorter,
the later they have been taken, as I before-mention'd.</P>
<P>Fourthly, The same Objections do lie about the shrinking and swelling of
the last Substance that preserves the Standard, as in the former way. I could
instance in some other Objections, but that I conceive these will be sufficient
to shew the difficulty of procuring such a measure.</P>
<P>I have been more particular upon this Inquiry, for that this seems to be
the very <HI>Basis</HI> and Foundation of Geography and Navigation; and, 'till this
be well determin'd, all the Superstructure will be but infirm.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 21. 1683. I did the last Day explain to you the necessity there was of
a certain and determinate Measure or Standard of length;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The use of an universal Stan∣dard for mea∣sure.</NOTE> for that might be
so, not only to all the World at present, but that it be and remain to all Po∣sterity for the future; that so, by means of that, all things that could be re∣duc'd
to a certain Weight, Measure, Capacity, Power, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> might, by that
means, be compar'd, First, To that common Standard-measure, and after∣wards
one with another; because without such a natural and perpetual Stan∣dard,
neither could the present quantities of things be compar'd with those
of preceding Ages, nor indeed one with another at present; nor could future
Ages have the true Use and Benefit in this Particular of the Obversations
and Inventions of this present; for to instance in no other Particular at
present, I shew'd you how every one of the measures of the Earth taken by
any of the Antients differ'd both one from another, and all of them from the
measures now last of all found; and how those quantities, which they took of
a Degree, thereby seem'd to have diminish'd ever since the first that was ta∣ken
this way. So that it doth necessarily follow, either that the Standard-measure,
made use of by them, did continually increase or grow bigger, the
longer it remain'd in the World, or that the very Body of the Earth itself,
did really, from time to time, as it grew older and older, shrink into less
and less Dimensions, much after the same way as we find divers animated Bo∣dies,
as Plants and Animals, upon growing old, really to do; whence, as I
hinted, the Mountains and Vallies, and the like inequalities of the Earth's
Surface might seem to be nothing else but the wrinkles and puckering of the
Skin of the old <HI>Vesta.</HI> There is no impossibility nor absurdity in either of
these Solutions or Suppositions. Nor will I determine or prepossess any with
a positive assertion of my Opinion, which is the most likely; only this I may
say, that there seems a kind of unnecessity to admit either the one or the other,
If at least we will give any credit to the truth of the Relations, or to the
certainty and exactness of their Observations (for it may lie also in either
of those) but that seems not so probable;<NOTE PLACE="marg">That the Earth shrinks.</NOTE> for my part I am inclin'd to be∣lieve
that the Body of the Earth doth really shrink and grow less, by reason
that the Gravity of the Earth doth seem to press and ram the parts thereof
continually closer and closer together, and for that it seemeth not so na∣tural
to conceive that the common measure should continually grow bigger
and bigger, especially, since it is believ'd rather that the size of Men grows
less and less, and consequently it seems less probable, that the Foot, Fathom,
Pace, and the like, which are deduc'd from the size of Mens Feet, fathoming
and going, should grow bigger; but be that what it will, it seems at least to
shew the great Use and Conveniency of a natural, universal, and perpetual
Standard of length: I have already mention'd two ways that have been
thought of and attempted for the making this universal Standard, and those
were; First, The length of a single free <HI>Pendulum</HI> vibrating Seconds of
Time.</P>
<P><PB N="462" REF="441"/>
Secondly, The length of one Thousanth part of a Minute or Mile found
upon the Earth by accurate Astronomical and Geometrical Mensuration to
be for a Geometrical Pace, and a fifth part of that for a Foot.</P>
<P>I told you also what Objections there lay both against the one and the o∣ther
way, and I shew'd you also how those uncertainties might be ascertain'd,
and the difficulties remov'd; but neither of them could be perfectly regu∣lated
and ascertain'd without a great deal of Care, Pains and Skill, which yet
(for all accurate Observations) is necessary to be done. I could have shew'd
some other ways of making a universal, natural and perpetual Measure;
but for the purpose of Geography and Navigation, these possibly, when
rectify'd as they ought, may prove the best. I explain'd the last time how
one of those measures might be found or made by Observation; I shall now
a little more particularly discourse of the second way, namely, That, by the
true length of a Degree upon the level Surface of the Earth, found by accurate
Observations. Now there are many ways to find out and determine the
Magnitude of a Degree that are mention'd by Authors, and there may be
many more; but they may be all reduc'd to two general Heads.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ways of measuring a Degree.</NOTE> Such as require some Caelestial Observations to determine the De∣gree,
or other certain part of a great Circle imagin'd upon the Surface of
the Earth.</P>
<P>And, Secondly, Such as only require Observations made upon the Earth
to determine the same. The First, for brevity's sake, may be call'd the A∣stronomical;
the Second Geographical.</P>
<P>The Astronomical ways are two,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Astrono∣mical ways.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> First, The finding the difference of
Latitude between two places lying due North and South of each other, or
under the same Meridian, by accurate Observations of some Caelestial Bodies,
whether Sun or Stars.</P>
<P>And the Second, The finding the said difference of Latitude between two
places lying in some other Position to each other, whose true Positions are
known, and not in or very near the East and West of each other, and so
finding the proportional length of the part of the Azymuthal Circle, then
finding by exact Mensuration upon the Earth, or otherwise with some known
measure, the true distance between them in a straight Line.</P>
<P>The Astronomical Observations necessary for the finding the true <HI>Latitude</HI>
of any place may be either made in the Day or in Night;<NOTE PLACE="marg">To find the La∣titude of a place.</NOTE> by the Sun
whose Altitude, Azymuth and Declination for any time of the Day being
known, the <HI>Latitude</HI> may easily be found, but the best of all Azimuths is the
true South and Meridian: For that First, The labour of Calculation to re∣duce
it to the Meridian is sav'd: But, Secondly, Because the Body of the
Sun is there mov'd with a horizontal or level motion, and so does not so sud∣dainly
Change its Altitude, but remain sensibly the same for some time.
Thirdly, Because the Body of the Sun is there most remov'd from the Hori∣zon,
and so will there have the least Refraction, which, in this Case is very
considerable, and must be avoided as far as may be. In the Night the Lati∣tude
of a Place may be found by the observation of the Altitude of any one
known Star, whose Azymuth and Declination is known; but here also the
best Position of any such Star for this purpose is, when it is in the Meri∣dian,
and if it pass the Meridian both Northwards and Southwards, the Zen∣ith,
the best is that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Southwards; and of all Stars for this purpose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stars near the Zenith best for this purpose.</NOTE>
those are best for such Observations as pass the nearest the Zenith of the
place. (Because, as I shew'd before, the great incumbrance of all▪ All ronomi∣cal
Observations is thereby remov'd, namely, Refraction.) Now, the Re∣fractions
are always so much the greater, the nearer the Body observ'd is to
the Horizon, but the nearer the Zenith the less; but the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of pro∣portions
of such Refractions is not so certainly found, because, neither is the
Refraction the same at all places, nor the same at one and the same place at
differing Seasons of the Year, nor in differing times of the Day and Night,
<PB N="463" REF="442"/>
tho' the Sun or Star be in both those times in the same Altitude, and is not
yet reduc'd to any certain Rule or Calculation: And therefore the best way of
all, is that which doth wholly avoid that Inconvenience, which is the way that
I above twenty Years since, for this very end and intention, explain'd to the
<HI>Royal Society,</HI> and which, about fourteen Years since, I made use of in making
my Observations for the finding the parallax of the Orb of the Earth among
the fix'd Stars, which had hardly been possible any other way, especially to
avoid all manner of Doubt or Objection; and that was the Observation of
some Star which pass'd very near the Zenith of the place; where in a very
clear Night there is no Refraction at all; and this was the way which Mon∣sieur
<HI>Picart,</HI> and the Gentlemen of the Royal <HI>Academy</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> have, since
that time, made use of in their Observation for the finding the difference of
Latitude between <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Amiens,</HI> which, upon this account, is much more
accurate than any of the other ways which before that time had been taken by
any, either of the Antients or Moderns who had made this Observation: For
tho' I confess we do not certainly know what ways some of the Antients made
use of, yet by considering of the ways they might make use of, we may with
probability enough conceive, that it was not this way, by observing the Stars
in the Zenith, especially since we do not find that they had any notion of Re∣fraction
at all, and therefore 'twas not very probable that they should provide
against it, the notion or invention of Refraction being not much before <HI>Ti∣cho
Brahe,</HI> and he seems to be the first that reduc'd it to Rule; for tho' <HI>Ptolo∣my</HI>
and some of the Antients did take some notice of the alterations of the
Air, and of some alterations they caus'd in the appearances of Caelestial Bo∣dies
through them, yet it seem'd to be no more than this, That they con∣ceiv'd
that the grosser Air and Vapours near the Horizon did cause the Cae∣lestial
Bodies to appear greater near the Horizon than near the Zenith, which
was a mistake likewise; for neither does the Refraction of the Air any ways
cause such an appearance, but rather the contrary; nor is there indeed really
any such appearance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Refraction does not make Bo∣dies to appear bigger near the Horizon.</NOTE> if it be more curiously inquir'd into, it being only Opti∣cal,
and rising from the imaginary greater distance of the Sun and Moon
near the Horizon, where the known distances upon the Earth can be com∣par'd
with them; for otherwise the Bodies of the Sun and Moon would ap∣pear
less, as is very evident in the vertical <HI>Diameter,</HI> which is sometime a
quarter less than it ought to be, as any one that will examine the Rising or
Setting Sun, will plainly perceive, by the help of a Telescope fitted with a
Micrometer. Again, The Refraction of the Air elevating the two extream
Points of the Horizontal Diameter pretty near perpendicularly in the two
Vertical Circles that pass through those Points; and all those Vertical Cir∣cles
meeting in the Zenith, it follows, that the greater the Refraction of the
Atmosphere is, the shorter will appear the Horizontal Diameter of the Sun
or Moon, nor was this Propriety, whether known or not, made use of by any
before <HI>Ticho Brahe,</HI> tho' ever since that time it hath been acknowlodg'd and
verify'd by all Astronomers, and yet 'tis not agreed upon, what the Proporti∣ons
of it are; but a sort of randum Numbers are set down, of which the true
ground is not assign'd, that I know, any where; and possibly the thing it self in
strictness may be almost impossible, being uncertain even in itself, and being
in a continual state of change.</P>
<P>I need not, I suppose, mention the way how to come by the Latitude of a
place where the Declination, Altitude and Azymuth is given, that being com∣mon
and easily enough known. Nor shall I need to mention any other diffi∣culties
in this Astronomical way, but rather proceed to the second way how
to find two places in any Position whatsoever, which are distant from each o∣ther
a Degree of a great Circle of the Earth, or any other less assignable
part without making any Observation of any Caelestial Body; which is that
which I call the Geographical or Mechanical way.</P>
<P>This Mechanical or Geographical Probleme then may,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Geographi∣cal way of measuring a Degree.</NOTE> by various Means
and Instruments, be perform'd according to the particular way that is made
use of for effecting thereof; the thing that is to be found being the inclination,
of the Perpendiculars of two distinct places one to another. This, as I told
you, was most certainly found by finding where those Perpendiculars pointed
<PB N="464" REF="443"/>
in the Heavens, by seeing how far the Zenith of the place was distant from
this or that Star which pass'd the Meridian, the Zenith of the place being
the continuation or upper end of the Perpendicular or Plumb-line of the place.
This also may be found by Calculation from the height of the Sun or fix'd
Stars taken in any known Azymuth. But the Geographical ways are by the
level Lines of any two distant places, which level Lines are Lines at right
Angles, to the Perpendiculars of those places; and in this way the Query is to
find what Angle the two level Lines make with one another, or with the Per∣pendiculars
of the distant places. This way, were the Ray of Vision from
place to place a true straight Line, might, by convenient Instruments, be
made the easiest and the most exact; and it were possible this way to deter∣mine
the quantity of a Degree even to a single Third, which would come
within two Foot by measure, according to the quantity of a Degree collected
from the best Observations which have yet been made. So that could the
Mensuration of the distance be made as exact as the Observation of the level
Line, or the certainty of the magnitude of the Body of the Earth, or of the
quantity of a Degree, it might be adjusted to all imaginable exactness; and since
there are some places upon the Earth which may be seen more than a Degree,
nay, more than two Degrees distant, it were possible to determine it within
one single Foot: For, First, By means of the level of Water, an Instru∣ment
to take the level Line may be made of any length desir'd so as to be
able to distinguish Thirds of a Degree; and since by the help of Telescopes,
which may be made and easily used in a Horizontal Posture almost to any
length, the sight can distinguish the parts of the Object to as great a certainty,
there need to be no deficiency in the exactness of such Observations, were the
Rays of Vision true right Lines. And by the same means of long Telescope
Sights, the distances between such two Stations might as accurately be mea∣sur'd,
as I shall mention by and by. There are various ways or performing
it this way, mention'd in several Authors, but I think none more plain and
easy than these I shall instance in.</P>
<P>As, First, From a very high Cliff adjoining to Sea, the Altitude of the
same above the level of the Sea being exactly measer'd the Angle that the
Perpendicular makes with the visual Ray, that touches the Horizon of the
Sea, must be exactly observ'd; or else the Angle that the visual Ray makes
with the Horiozantal or level Line; for in both those Cases the Effect <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Consequence is the same; for the level Line being at right Angles with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Perpendicular of the aforesaid Angles so found, must be the complement of
the other to a right Angle.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Table <HI>IX.</HI> Fig. 4.</NOTE> As for instance, let CD represent the Surface
of the Sea, A the Center of the Earth, BC the Cliff, the height of
whose highest Point B above the level of the Sea is exactly known by measure,
the Angle ABD is found by the Plumb-line BC, and the Telescope BG direct∣ed
at the Horizon of the Sea D, or the complement thereof the Angle FBG
is found by the level EF, and Telescope BG; having therefore the Angle
ABD by Observation, the complement there of ABD is likewise given and
in the same manner, if FBG be given by Observation, BAD equal to it is also
given. Now by the common Tables or Secants you may from the length of
BC and the Angle DBF or DAB easily deduce the Diameter of the Earth;
for as the difference between the Radius and the Secant of the Angle at A is
to the Radius, so is the height of the Cliff BC, to the Semidiameter of the
Earth. I could have instanc'd in several other ways of finding the Diamet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
of the Earth from the knowledge of these two, or which <HI>Cassati</HI> in his <HI>Terra
Machinis Mota,</HI> gives a great many, some of them complicated enough, but
I mention this as being the most facile and simple way that can be thought
upon, there being hardly any difficulty at all, either in the Instruments neces∣sary
either for the observing the Angle, or of measuring the height above the
level of the Sea, or in computing the Consequence when the Experiment is
made, or of finding the Meridian Line or Azymuth or Distance or Latitude,
Longitude, or the like; which are necessary to be observ'd in other ways,
and that with great accurateness, I thought the best to mention. So that one
would imagine there could not possibly be any other way to equalize it for
this purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="465" REF="444"/>
But what I mention'd to you heretofore to be the incumbrance and per∣plexity
of all Astronomical Observations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The inconve∣niences of this and the like ways from Re∣fraction.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> the Refraction, or rather In∣flection
of the Air, is abundantly more considerable, and perplexing here in∣somuch
that how plausible soever this may seem, yet this inconvenience in∣terferring
makes it almost wholly impossible: For the Rays of Vision which
run as Tangents to the Surface of the Sea, are by the Refractiveness or ra∣ther
Inflectiveness of the vaporous Air near the Horizon rais'd much higher
than they ought to be, if they proceeded in direct Lines from the Eye or
Sight of the Instrument at the top of the Cliff to the Horizontal Point D of
the Surface: Which Refraction or Inflection, were it also certain, might, by
some trials, be remedied and reduced to a Rule, but that being so extreamly
uncertain, and various, and differing almost with every blast of Wind, and
every several Degree of Heat and Cold, Driness, or Moisture, Gravity, or
Levity of the Air, the Effects thereby produc'd are so various and uncertain;
that 'tis impossible to reduce them to any certain Rule.</P>
<P>However,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A second Geo∣graphical way.</NOTE> for variety, I shall mention a second Geographical way which may
be made use of for this purpose, <HI>viz.</HI> from two very high Hills which are very
far remov'd from each other, as suppose 60, 80, 100, or more Miles, which
yet are so situated, as that by means of a great Plain between, or else of an
interjacent Sea, they are visible each to other, whereof there are many in∣stances
to be found in the World, and even in <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Wales.</HI>
Let the inclination of the common visual Ray between them be exactly ob∣serv'd
with the Perpendiculars or level Lines of both those Places, and thence
deduce the true inclinations of the two Perpendiculars, or the two level
Lines of those places to one another, whereby you will certainly have the
quantity of the Angle of the Perpendiculars at the Center of the Earth, or
the quantity of the Arch of a great Circle of the Earth that is interjacent
between those places; then if the distance be over a Plain upon the Land by
measuring the interjacent Space by Chains, Rods, Wheels, or Triangles of
observation made from place to place, you will obtain the distance between
those Stations, and consequently the Magnitude or Semidiameter of the
Globe of the Earth. Or if the space interjacent be over the Sea, then by
measuring a certain length of Ground at right Angles with the visual Ray, if
it may be upon either of the said Hills, which is visible from the other of
those Hills, and by exact Observation finding all the Angles of such a Tri∣angle,
you will easily and very exactly, and much truer than by any Mensu∣ration
made between them, obtain the same thing as the other way, namely,
the true distance between them, and consequently the Magnitude or Semi∣diameter
of the Globe of the Earth; for instance, in the Figure, let B and
C represent the tops of two very high Hills distant from each other, by com∣pute
about threescore common <HI>English</HI> Miles, which are notwithstanding by
means of a large Vale or Sea between them, visible to each other. By In∣struments
as before,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Table IX. Figs.</NOTE> find at B the Angle ABC of the Perpendicular AB with
the visual Ray BC, and by Observations at C find the said inclination of the
Perpendicular AC, and visual Ray CB, namely the Angle ACB; then either
by an actual Mensuration of the Space or Distance BC, or by Triangles of
Observation in <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elius</HI> his way, or else by measuring a certain length, as BD
on the top of one of the Hills, as B, whose extreams, B a D are visible to each
other, and to the Point C of the other Hill, find any two of the Angles
at BC and D, and from thence find the side BC, and having before all the
Angles A, B, and C, you will easily find the Sides AB and AC which are the
distances of those places from the Center of the Earth, and if the space in∣terjacent
be Sea, you will easily obtain the side AE, which is the Semidiame∣ter
of the Globe, or Sphaerical Surface of the Sea, and consequently the true
length of a Degree of a great Circle on the Sea, which, for Navigation, is
the principal thing sought, and thence also collaterally may easily be found
the several heights of those Hills B and C above that level, and the like.<NOTE PLACE="marg">This way has its inconveni∣ences.</NOTE>
But this way, as the former, is also incumbr'd with the Refraction, or ra∣ther
Inflection of the Air; so that the Line BC is not really a straight Line,
but a crooked or bended Line, and so those places B and C are visibie to each
other much farther than they really could be, were there no inflection in the
<PB N="466" REF="445"/>
Air, but that the Ray that touch'd the Sea interjacent, did always proceed
straight.</P>
<P>We need not therefore trouble our selves either with those,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Micrography. <HI>p.</HI> 217</NOTE> or with any
other of the like ways, tho' there are divers to be found dispers'd here and
there in Authors, and more of that kind might be thought of, but they will
be all in vain, since the Refraction or Inflection of the Ray near the Horizon,
upon the exact observation of which so much is built, do so confound the truth
of the Angle, that since great things are to be calculated from little, 'twill
be in vain to think of coming at any possible certainty by the ways of Obser∣vation.
Now, that this is not <HI>Gratis dictum,</HI> besides what I my self have ob∣serv'd,
and Publish'd at large in the Year 1664, let me acquaint you with
what the <HI>French</HI> have lately taken notice of in their way of trying by a Le∣vel:
They observ'd then, that an Object which at break of Day appear'd in
the Horizon, or Level-line, or a little above it, a little after Sun-rising
appear'd below it; and the same appearance they found in the Evening, for the
Object before Sun-set appear'd below the Level, which soon after Sun-set would
appear in it or above it; insomuch, that in half an Hours time the difference
has been observ'd to be no less than three Minutes, which must needs cause a
very great Error in the computation of the Magnitude of a Degree, and con∣sequently
the Magnitude of the Earth; for if there be three or four Miles
Error in the space of less than a quarter of a Degree, it will amount to an
Error of a fifth or sixth part of a Degree in a whole Degree, and so a vast
Error in the Compass of the Earth. The cause of which appearances they
conceive to be the Cold of the Night condensing the Vapours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cause of this Inflection.</NOTE> and so mak∣ing
them to descend towards the Earth, leaving the higher parts of the Air
more pure, thin and serene, which makes an Inflection of the Ray which is to
pass obliquely through Media of such differing density, and so the Refraction
or Inflection is the less. But yet, even then the Ray doth not pass without
a considerable Refraction or Inflection; for which they give us Experiments
of two Observations both made at Noon Day, by which the same Persons not
only found there was a Refraction, but that there was a considerable difference
between one Day and another Day at Noon as to their Refractions. To this
purpose in the Summer time, at Noon, in a clear Day, they observ'd the
Tower of <HI>Montlehery</HI> from the top of the Tower of <HI>Nostre Dame</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI>
and found the Foot of the laid Tower of <HI>Montlehery</HI> to appear exactly in the
Level or Horizontal Line; but some Days after, at Noon also, observing the
top of <HI>Nostre Dame</HI> Tower from the Foot of the Tower of <HI>Montlehery,</HI> they
found it to be 11'. 30''. below the level; but comparing the measur'd distance
of those two places, and examining from the measure of a Degree, found the
other way nameless by the Perpendicular Stars, they found that the Angle
ought to have been 13'. 30''. which is two whole Minutes difference in the distance
of 81894 <HI>English</HI> Feet, or about fifteen Miles and an half; by which we may
plainly see what exactness is to be expected from any Mensuration of the
Earth that should be this way made; and therefore there can be no more
certain way of determining the Magnitude of the Earth by measure, than the
way I first of all propos'd, and that was by observing the Stars near the Zenith.</P>
<P>Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vse and Benefit of Re∣fraction or In∣flection.</NOTE> tho' this inflective quality of the Air be a great incumbrance and
confusion of Astronomical Observations made both at Sea and Land, yet is it
not without some considerable benefit to Navigation; and indeed in some
cases the benefit thereby attain'd is much greater than would be the benefit of
of having the Ray proceed in an exact straight Line. I shall not need to in∣stance
in the Observation made by the <HI>Hollanders</HI> that wintered upon <HI>Nova
Zembla,</HI> who, by means hereof, found that the Night in that place shortned
no less than a whole Month, which must needs be a very great Comfort to
all such places as lie very far towards the North or South Poles, where the
length of the Night, and want of seeing the Sun, cannot chuse but be very
tedious and irksome. But then it may be said, that this benefit is only to a
very small part of the World, and that the most inconsiderable and least fre∣quented
of all, by reason of the extreamity of the Cold, and want of other
necessary accommodations for the use of Man. But yet we find chat some of
those Northern Parts have, of late Years, been frequented by Navigation
<PB N="467" REF="446"/>
not without very considerable benefit and advantage in the returns, and may,
in time, be very much more, when the Industry and Skill of future Underta∣kers
shall discover Passages that way to the <HI>Indies</HI> or South Sea, which for se∣veral
Reasons, I conceive, may in time be effected, and with very great ad∣vantage
frequented: But this only by the bye. The great advantage I con∣sider
therein, is the first discovery of Land upon the Sea; for by means here∣of
the tops of Hills and high Lands are raised up into the Air so as to be dis∣coverable
several Leagues farther off on the Sea than they would be, were
there no such Refraction; which is of great benefit to Navigators for steer∣ing
their Course in the Night when they approach near Land, and likewise
for directing them in the Day-time much more certainly than the most exact
Caelestial Observations could do by the help of an uninflected Ray, especial∣ly
in such places as they have no soundings.</P>
<P>And I doubt not but that by some Observations carefully made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To discover a Ships distance at Sea.</NOTE> the In∣flections
of the Air may be reduc'd to exactness enough, for several sorts of
Terrestrial Observations which may be of great use in the practice of Navi∣gation,
tho' I very much doubt whether it will ever be exact enough for de∣termining
the measure of a Degree, and consequently that of the Earth; the
use that I chiefly intend of this discovery may be for determining the distance
of a Ship at Sea by means hereof from a Land so raised: The way how I con∣ceive
this may be effected is thus. First, The descent of the true Level-line
below the apparent Level-line, for several distances, must be known by Cal∣culation,
the true Level being a Circular Line upon a Sphaerical Superficies of
the Earth, and the apparent Level-line being a tangent Line, it will be easy
enough from the knowledge of the Earths Semidiameter to find this Descent.</P>
<P>Now the Semidiameter of the Earth from the most accurate Observations
that have been yet made being 20923500⅘ Feet, or 3962¾ Miles, and 180
Feet of 5280, which is our Statute <HI>English</HI> Mile, it will follow that the true
Level-line will be easily found by the help of a Table of Secants; the De∣scent
below the Horizontal Line for any determinate, distance being always to
the Semidiameter of the Earth, as the excess of the Secant of the distance a∣bove
the Radius is to the Radius. But because this Statute Mile is of no use
in Navigation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of reduceing the measure of a Mile.</NOTE> Navigation always accounting the sixtieth part of a Degree
to be a Mile, and three of those Miles to be a League, it will be necessary
to reduce the Mile, we account by, to the measure of a Degree found, account∣ing
it to be a full sixtieth part of the length thereof which is found, and ac∣cordingly
ought to be the Measures and Divisions of the Log-line. Now,
by the aforesaid Observations there being no less than 365184 <HI>English</HI> Feet
in a whole Degree, there will be 6086 4/10 Feet in a sixtieth part thereof, and
therefore the measure of every such Mile ought to be accounted 1014 Fathom
two Foot and 4/10, and consequently a League will be 18259, or 18260 Feet,
or 3043 Fathom and two Foot; the Descent then for such Leagues will be as
follows, for one such League, 7, 976688 Feet, or to make use of round numbers
eight Feet, at two Leagues distance thirty two Foot, at three Leagues seven∣ty
two Foot, at four Leagues one hundred and thirty Foot; or if you will
reckon by Minute Miles, then the descent of one Mile is 10 ⅔ Inches almost,
at two Miles will be three Foot and an half, at three Miles eight Foot, at
four Miles fourteen Feet, or thereabout; at five twenty two Foot and an
half, at six Miles thirty two Foot, at seven Miles forty four Foot, at eight
Miles fifty six Foot, at nine Miles seventy two Foot. Now the use that may
be made of this knowledge I conceive to be this, that when a Land is ap∣proach'd
by ascending the Shore or Mast with a small Perspective Glass, 'till
the Surf of the Sea upon the Shore be discover'd by knowing the height of
the Eye, that so discovers it from the Surface of the Water by the Ship, a
much nearer and truer compute of the distance thereof can be made than by
any other way yet practis'd: But this only here by the bye, because hereafter
when I come to speak of that Subject, I shall mention several other feasable
ways of doing it. I here only mention it upon the account of the Refractive∣ness
of the Air, which tho' it spoil the accuracy of Observations for the mea∣sure
of a Degree, yet in such Observations as these it may serve well enough, at
least 'till better and more accurate be made use of.</P>
<P><PB N="468" REF="447"/>
These two Fundamentals concerning the true Figure and Shape of the
Earth, and likewise of its Magnitude being acquir'd, it remains in the next
place to find out some means to distinguish every Point or Part of the Surface
of this Globular Body in respect of any other; we are therefore to inquire
what helps are to be found that are useful for this purpose: For upon the
Surface of a perfect Sphaerical Body, there is no one point but has the very
same Respect to the whole Surface thereof, that any other Point hath; as
suppose the Sphaerical Body were of Chrystal or Glass perfectly Polish'd and
Uniform, no one Point has any Mark or Characteristick to distinguish from
any other, and a Point being once lost, 'tis impossible to find the same again,
tho' it be turn'd a thousand times; because there is suppos'd to be no one
Point of it that differs from any other, and they cannot be distinguish'd
or measur'd from, and every point may be said to be the middle of the whole
Circumference; and thence it is that the People of every Country and Place
have thought themselves to be in the middle of the Earth, and all the Neigh∣bouring
Ambient Countries to lie towards the Extremities. Which Opini∣on
always hath and always will possess the Minds of ignorant People, 'till by
Learning and Art they are better inform'd; for seeing an extension of Land
or Seas round about them on every side, and seeing the Sky whelm'd over
them like a Dish or Hemisphere, the middle of which seems to be just over
their Heads, and the Brims to touch the Earth and Seas at a great distance,
they cannot without much thinking and considering (which few People care
to do, especially in matters which they think not of immediate concern) they
cannot chuse but be impos'd on by the appearance to their Sense, which seems
so to represent it; and if so at Land, much more does it appear so on the Sea
where there is no sight of Land, when the Superficial Parts of the Sphaerical
Surface have no remaining visible marks more than the Chrystal Ball. On
the Land indeed, and in sight of Land there are many obvious helps to find
and distinguish one place from another, and the Positions of one from all the
other that are visible and accessible, as Hills, Vales, Mountains, Woods, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
But the Surface of the Sea wants all those, and has nothing but a fluctuating
changing Surface, which way soever you look 'tis all alike, you know not
which way you go forwards or backwards, whether the Wind blows for you
or against you, or the Current sets you near to or further from your Port;
which was the cause why the Antients never durst venture out of the sight of
Land but went along the Shores, they being not then able to distinguish, e∣specially
in cloudy or close Weather, which way lay the Quarters of the Earth
or Azymuth. And indeed before Astronomy was known, the very Quarters
of the Wind were not distinguish'd with respect to the Heaven's, but only
with respect to the Countries from whence they seem'd to come. Thence we
find that they call'd one <HI>Vulturnus,</HI> another <HI>Phaenicius,</HI> a third <HI>Africus, Olym∣pius,
Thracius, Hellespontius,</HI> and the like, which were the Names of the Coun∣tries
from whence they seem'd to come.</P>
<P>But the Diligence and Inquisitiveness of succeeding Ages has furnish'd us
with better and more universal ways or distinguishing and naming the Quar∣ters
of the Winds, or the Azymuthes, or Divisions of the Horizon, and Posi∣tions
of the Parts of the Surface of the Earth, and not only so, but of determi∣ning
the distance of any place from the Points certainly fix'd upon this
Globe of the Earth.</P>
<P>I shall therefore in the next place consider what means there are hitherto
found and made use of for dividing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the ways yet known to discover the place of a Ship at Sea.</NOTE> and distinguishing, and defining of the
Superficial Parts of this Globe of the Earth, so as certainly to know any one
Point of the Surface of it, from any other determin'd, whether upon Land or
Sea; for, that there are no two Points of the whole Surface but that have some
ways or other their distinct Characteristiks.</P>
<P>There have been various ways invented of performing this Effect; those
that are thought of the best, and so apply'd at present to use, may be reduc'd
into two Heads, and these arc Caelestial or Terrestial, namely, some Re∣spects
or Aspects of Caelestial Bodies, or Situation, Substance, Qualification,
Form, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of some Terestrial Bodies.</P>
<P><PB N="469" REF="448"/>
The Caelestial are such as are afforded by the Motion or Position of the
Caelestial Bodies, <HI>viz.</HI> the Sun, Moon and Stars.</P>
<P>The Terrestrial are either, <HI>1st.</HI> Magnetical, by the help of the Compass,
or Magnetical Needle: Or, <HI>2dly,</HI> Computatory, by keeping account of the
Course and Distance, fail'd from a known place: Or, <HI>3dly,</HI> By founding the
depth of the Sea, and examining the Substances that are to be found at the
bottom: Or, <HI>4thly,</HI> By the Sight and Prospects of some high and eminent
Places which may be seen at a great distance upon the Sea, and from thence
collecting the Position bearing and distance from them.</P>
<P>The Caelestial, and the two former of the Terrestrial are of use in all places,
the two last are more particular, and restrain'd only to such places where
soundings are to be found; for there be many places where there is no Bot∣tom
to be sounded, and many others where no part of Land can be disco∣ver'd;
in which Cases recourses must be had to the more general ways, by the
Heavens, the Needle, the Course, and Diftance.</P>
<P>The helps which the Heavens afford for distinguishing of places on the Earth
either are, <HI>1st.</HI> Their Position in respect of the Earth: Or,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Caelestial ways.</NOTE> <HI>2dly,</HI> Their
Motion. By their Position they serve as helps to find the Latitude of a
Place; and by their Motion they may, in time, serve to discover the Longi∣tude.</P>
<P>First, By their Position they help us to discover, that this vast Globe on
which we live,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By their Positi∣ons.</NOTE> and which seems so fix'd and steadfast, is mov'd round (like a
Globe which is commonly made to represent it) on an <HI>Axis,</HI> or an imaginary
Line that passes from side to side through the very Center thereof; or like a
two Headed Top upon two imaginary Points, which are Diametrically op∣posite
to each other upon the Surface thereof; each Revolution of which is
perform'd once in twenty four Hours from West to East, and thereby each
part of the Earth, according to its Situation or Distance upon the Surface
from one or other of those two Points, moves or is mov'd in a Circle round
the said Axis greater or less, according to its distance from the nearest of
them; so that all the Parts that lie at equal, and the greatest distance from
them both are mov'd in the greatest Circle of all the rest. By means hereof is
discover'd, First, The Positions of Places one to another, in respest of their
Revolution; that is, the Azymuths or Quarters of the Horizon, or usual
Limit of the Heavens; for by means hereof the Caelestial Bodies first begin
to appear at one Quarter of the Horizon, and to cross the Heavens over us,
and to Descend, and Set, and Disappear on the other; whence the former is
call'd the rising part of the Heavens, and the other the setting part, and the
middle part between these two are call'd the Meridional, and the Polar,
which is either North or South; and then an imaginary straight Line sup∣pos'd
drawn between them either upon the Earth, or in the Heavens, is cal∣l'd
the Meridian of that place where this Supposition is made.</P>
<P>Now that end of this North or South Line which goes towards that Quar∣ter
of the Heaven where the Star is in the extreamity of the Tail of the lit∣tle
Bear, near which is the Polar Point in the Heavens, is call'd the North,
and the other end is call'd the South. Now, one or the other of these is al∣ways
visible both at Land and Sea in all parts of the Globe in a clear Night;
but the Polar Points of the Earth, either in the North or South, have not
yet been difcover'd.</P>
<P>This North and South Line then is discoverable by means of the Heavens
in every point of the Surface of the Earth, and by means of that, the Posi∣tion
of Places with respect to them, is easily known, and thence also all the
other Quarters or Parts of the Horizon of any Place are easily discover'd;
for a Line imagin'd drawn in the Plain of the Horizon through any place,
cutting the former Line at right Angles, points out in the Limb of the Ho∣rizon,
the East and West.</P>
<P><PB N="470" REF="449"/>
These two Lines distinguish the Horizon or visible Limb of the Heavens
into four equal Quarters or Quadrants, <HI>viz.</HI> The first between the North and
East; the second between the East and South; the third between the South
and West; and the fourth between the West and North. Now each of these
Quadrants may be and usually are subdivided into lesser Divisions. The Sea∣men
generally content themselves in Steerings and taking Bearings, with a
Division of each of these into eight parts, so that the whole Horizon is di∣vided
into thirty two Parts, which they call Points, because they are pointed
out by their Compass or Winds, because of their taking notice in which of
those Points the Winds blow; the first are the principal Points, <HI>viz.</HI> N. S.
E. W., the Lines that divide these four Quadrants in half are the half Winds
or Points, namely, NE. SE. SW. NW.; the eight Points in the middle of
these are the Quarter Winds, <HI>viz.</HI> NNE. ENE. ESE. SSE. SSW. WSW.
WNW. NNW. all these together make sixteen, and these being again sub∣divided
into halves make sixteen more, which are the by Winds, <HI>viz.</HI> N. b E.
N. b W. S. b E. S. b W. E. b S. E. b N. W. b S. W b N. and N E. b N.
N. E b E. S. W. b. S. S. W. b W. These again they do subdivive into four
Parts in their Accounts cast up, or protraction of their Course. Astronomo∣ers
divide the Circuit of Horizon as they do all other, into Degrees, Mi∣nutes,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> And so do Mariners in observations of Amplitudes and Varia∣tions
of the Compass, tho' not in the Bearings of Lands and Islands.</P>
<P>Now, thus far the Heavens only serve for determining the Position of any
Place whatsoever, with respect to the bearing of those Polar Points of the
Earth I but now mention'd, but shew not at all how far they are remov'd or
distant from either of those Points. This also the Magnetical Needle or
Compass does in part discover, but not wholly without Rectification by the
help of the Heavens, as I shall, in its proper place, explain. But this does
little as to its determining the positive Point of this Place upon the Surface
of this Globe, but only by the account of the Course Sail'd, 'tis known-pretty
near which way the Place lies, from whence the departure is made, and
which way the Course lies to the Place bound to. Some further information
therefore is requisite to determine the distance from these Polar Points, or
from an imaginary Circle incompassing the Globe, lying at equal distance
be∣tween
them, call'd the Aeauinoctial-Line, or more commonly the Line; of
which I shall speak more hereafter.</P>
<P>This then the Heavens afford an help for, namely, by their Position or
height above the Horizon, or the visible Limb of the Sky which seemeth to
touch the Earth; but before I speak of this I shall a little further explain the
true notion of the Horizon.</P>
<P>The Horizon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the true no∣tion of the Ho∣rizon.</NOTE> or, as the Seamen call it, the Orison, at Sea is the extream
edges of the Sea which the Sky seems to touch, which, in clear Weather, is
very easy to be seen in the Day-time, like a black Line bounding the Sky, and
may be also plainly enough discover'd in a very clear Star-light-Night, espe∣cially
when the Moon is pretty well inlighten'd, or in the time of the Twi∣light,
when as yet the Stars are very visible; but when the Air is thick and
hazy, tho' the Sun, Moon, or Stars may be discover'd when they are a
pretty way above it, yet the Horizon cannot be distinguish'd, but the Sea
and Sky gradually mix with one another, so as no Observation can then be
made of it, there being no distinct visible separation.</P>
<P>This visible edge of the Sea is nearer or further off, according as the Eye
that sees it is nearer to, or higher from the level Surface of the Sea; the pro∣portions
of which one to the other I hinted the last time, but shall now some∣what
farther explain.</P>
<P>The sensible Horizon Mathematically consider'd, is an imaginary Plain
touching the Globe of the Earth or Sea in any Place or Point thereof, which
is to be consider'd; and this Plain is suppos'd to be extended to the extrea∣mities
of the universe every way; so that when any Star or Caelestial Body
on the Eastern side of the Meridian appears in the Plain thereof, it is Rising,
and when they appear in the Western side thereof, they are Setting; or ac∣cording
to the Copernican Hypothesis, the Horizon is an imaginary indefi∣nite
Plain, touching the Globe of the Earth at the place design'd, which,
<PB N="471" REF="450"/>
together with the motion of the Globe, is carry'd round once in a Day, and
so twice in that time passes over the Caelestial Bodies that lie in its Zone; when
the Easter-most side passes them, they are said to be Rising, and when the
Wester-most, they are said to be Setting, both which Hypothesis equally
solve the Phaenomena; and upon this speculative notion of the Horizon,
there is also suppos'd a Rational Horizon, which is also an imaginary indefi∣nite
Plain passing through the Center of the Earth, and parallel to the former,
namely, at the distance of the Semidiameter of the Earth; which distance
being extended to the sixt Stars, becomes wholly insensible, being view'd
from the Earth, and so as to them, and even to the Planets superior or far∣ther
distant from us than the Sun, they become wholly the same, and the sen∣sible
and rational Horizon are one and the same imaginary Plain or Circle in
the Heavens; but in the Moon especially, and in the Planets nearer to us
than the Sun, they are, by curious and nice Observation, sometimes disco∣verable:
But those Speculations more concern Astronomy, than Geography
or Navigation, and therefore I shall say no more of them at present, but ra∣ther
speak of a third Horizon, which is a real and visible Circle, and that
which Navigators call the Orison.</P>
<P>The sensible Horizon, as it concerns Navigation, is not a Plain, nor a
Sphaerical, nor Conical Surface, but rather an imaginary <HI>conoeidical</HI> Surface
touching the Sphaerical Surface of the Sea in a Circle, which Circle is nearer
or farther off from the Eye, which is in the Apex of the Conoeid, according
as the Eye is lower or higher rais'd into the Air above the Surface of the Sea,
and according as the inflective quality of the Air is less or greater; and from
the same causes that the distance thereof from the Eye is diminish'd or aug∣mented,
does the imaginary Limits or Base of it, which is a Circle in the
Heavens, descend lower and lower below the Rational, or notionally sensible
Horizontal Line, or imaginary Circle in the Heavens. This is a third Hori∣zon
differing from both the other, and below them both in the Heavens; so
that to the Eastwards the Stars and Planets appear to have pass'd the Nauti∣cal
or Mariners Orison some time before they arrive at the Speculative or No∣tional
Horizons, and in the West they have pass'd the Notional Horizons
some time before they touch or arrive at the Nautical and Visible Orison. So
that all those Observations which are made at Sea, either for finding the
Azymuths, or for discovering the variation of the Compass, or for Altitudes,
or the like, are every one of them Erroneous, and there ought to be a recti∣fying
thereof made: For, First, How much the said Line appears below
the true Level or Tangent Line of the place, by so much less is the Altitude
of the Caelestial Body taken from it, than what it is taken at; and the Ampli∣tudes
in an Oblique Sphere will thereby also be considerably augmented more
than what they should have been by the common Theory of the Sphere, Cal∣culating
as from a true Horizon; for all the Geometrical Rules that are made
concerning the Notional Horizons; are produc'd from the consideration of
the Globe, and of the Proprieties and Affections thereof, and of Plains either
passing through the Center, or touching the superficies, and from the Hypo∣thesis
that the Rays of Light pass in straight Lines from the Caelestial Body
to any Point of the Surface of the Earth, in which they suppose the Eye of
the Observer to be plac'd; but because the Eye is never known to be exactly
in the Superficies of the Surface of the Sea, but at some height above it;
therefore the visible Orizon of the Navigator, if the Rays of Light were
straight, would be a Conical Surface, and not a plain; and the higher the
Eye is rais'd the sharper will be the Cone. But because the Rays of Light
are not really s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raight in their passage through the upper and lower parts of
the Atmosphere, but are by the Inflection of the unequal Density of the parts
of that Medium inflected into Curves, whose Concave side is towards the
Earth, therefore the Superficies of every visible Orizon is not a Conical, but
a Conoeidical Surface, in the Apex of which is plac'd the Eye aud the edge
of the Sea, which is a Circle upon it, the Center of which is in the Perpen∣dicular
below the Eye, and thereof is very near as much below the Surface
of the Sea under the Eye, as the Eye is rais'd above it; and as this Orizon
on the Earth is a lesser Circle, and not a greater Circle, so the Basis of this
<PB N="472" REF="451"/>
Conoeidical Body, in the Heavens is not a great Circle, as is the Rational
Horizon, but a lesser parall<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Circle below it, and that so much the more
below it, as the Eye is higher, elevated above the Surfaces of the Sea, and
as the inflective quality of the Air is greater.</P>
<P>Now, if we first consider the Rays of Light as straight Lines, we shall
find the Angles of the several Conical Superficies adapted to the several heights
of the Eye, as I have already mention'd, and thence the distance of Objects
may be ghess'd where they are discoverable; but that which I here men∣tion
it for is in order to find the true Situation of any place upon the Sea, in
respect of the two Polar Points where no Land is discoverable, which I
shall next shew you is discoverable by the Heavens, by knowing the height of
the Caelestial Bodies above the true Plain of the Horizon, or as Navigators
commonly above the Line, they call the Orison. And I have been somewhat
the longer upon this Discourse of the Orison, because it seems to be the
Foundation of all the Caelestial Observations that are made at Sea, and if
that be Erroneous, then all the Observations will be so too. It will there∣fore
be necessary to have the true Theory thereof, both for Latitudes and
Amplitudes, or Azymuths; I shall therefore add one Observation concerning
the Mariners Orison, and so conclude this present Discourse.</P>
<P>The Observation then is this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whence the Looming or Glaring of the Sea.</NOTE> That there are some Constitutions of the
Air, near the Surface of the Sea, that do really elevate the Orison above the
true Horizon or Level-line, and that is at such times as the Sea is said by the
Sea-men to <HI>Loom</HI> and <HI>Glare,</HI> as if it were Smooth'd and Polish'd, whereby
the Surface of the Sea seems to be lifted up above its own level Surface into
the Atmosphere incompassing it: And this I have often taken notice of, and
as near as I could ghess from what Observations I was able to make; I judge
it to proceed from a dense, and, as it were, foggy Air which lieth equally
spread upon the Surface of the Sea, not extending above ten or twelve Foot,
or there about, above the same, and there terminating in a kind of Level,
the Air above it being perfectly clear and transparent, but this under Air
having a Fogginess or Haziness in it, nothing can be seen through it but on∣ly
what appears above it; so that at a distance (tho' nothing of it can be
perceiv'd at the Ship) it appears to coalesce with the very Sea, and the Sur∣face
of this seems to be the Surface of the Water; so that by this means
the Mariners Orison instead of being below the true Horizon, is really rais'd
above it; and consequently Altitudes taken from that will be too low, and
additions ought to be made to the Altitudes found, to bring them nearer to
the true Horizon. Now, how to rectify this and the other Irregularities of
the Orison, I shall some other time give an account.</P>
<P>THe Author having mentioned in the foregoing Discourse several Methods that
have been proposed for finding and settling an universal Standard for Mea∣sure,
I thought it not improper to insert part of a Lecture read about 1683 upon that
Subject, and omitting the beginning of it, which treats only of the several unsucces∣sful
ways yet attempted, the rest of the Discourse is as follows.</P>

<DIV1>
<P>WHat I have farther to add,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Stand∣ard of Measure propos'd.</NOTE> as to the finding a Natural Universal Stand∣ard
for Measure, is a Conception of my own, of a way differing from
any other way whatsoever that I have ever heard of, which, I conceive will
afford a Natural Standard for Weight and Measure at all times, and in all
places, and which, I conceive, will not be very difficult to perform, if trial
be made with convenient Care and Accurateness; not that I pretend to dis∣cover
any new Thing or Propriety which none have ever observ'd before, no,
'tis that which all see and all know, and as trivial as the, pendulous vibrating
Motion, which, in Contempt, hath been call'd Swing Swangs, tho' the Ap∣plication
and Use of it, found by <HI>Galileo,</HI> hath since prov'd of such excellent
use; and possibly this also which I shall mention may not be unimproveable to
much better uses than I shall now mention.</P>
<P><PB N="473" REF="452"/>
It is I doubt not suffciently known to all present, that all fluid Bodies what∣soever
from the <HI>Homogeneity</HI> of their Texture and <HI>Heterogeneity</HI> to the in∣compassing
fluid <HI>Medium,</HI> have a power of Conglobation or forming them∣selves,
when in small parcels into Globular Bodies, and that the smaller they are
and the less difference of weight, the nearer they approach to a perfect Glo∣bular
Figure, and the bigger and more differing the contained, and contain∣ing
Fluids are, the more doth the form of the contain'd differ from that per∣fect
Sphaerical Figure, and there is one certain quantity of every simple Fluid,
which, in some certain <HI>Medium,</HI> will make the Conglobated Figure to be
flatted or ovall'd; so that the longer Diameter to the shorter shall bear a
certain assign'd proportion; for instance, to take the most remarkable, name∣ly,
2. to 1. I conceive then, that this quantity being certainly found, and
most accurately measur'd, will afford a natural and perpetual Standard of mea∣sure;
for instance, let <HI>Quicksilver</HI> perfectly depurated, and <HI>Rain,</HI> or <HI>Distill'd
Water</HI> be the two Fluids; I say, there is a certain quantity of <HI>Quicksilver</HI>
which, in such <HI>Water</HI> will be form'd into an ovall'd or flatted Body, so that
the Horizontal Diameter to the Perpendicular shall be as 2. to 1. This longer
Diameter I make a Primitive and Natural Standard of length, and the weight
of this Body of <HI>Mercury</HI> so ovall'd, I make the Primitive Sandard for Weight;
the same may be done with any other Fluid.</P>
<P>This may be also done by purely refin'd <HI>Gold</HI> or <HI>Silver,</HI> whose Purity may
be found by the proportion of weight it beareth to Rain-water; for if a
certain quantity of Gold be melted and pour'd out upon a perfectly smooth
and horizontal Surface of a Stone, this will form itself into an Oval Body,
whose Horizontal Diameter to the Perpendicular, will be as 2. to 1.</P>
<P>The same may be done with any other Metal besides Gold, but only we
cannot be so sure of the purity and unmixedness of the Metal, as we may
be of Gold.</P>
<P>It would be too long now to mention the various ways there may be used
for exactly finding, determining and measuring this Figure, but I design at
some other time to entertain the Society with the Experiment and Trial
thereof, which will make all things more evident and plain.</P>
<P>THe way mentioned at the end of this Discourse of exactly measuring the Fi∣gure
and Shape of any Body, I find described in another Paper, read <HI>Decem∣ber</HI>

<P>The knowledge of Nature and Art is advanc'd by the discovery of such
things, as serve like Engins or Organs, to make such further Inquisitions in
either as the Natural Faculties of Men, without such assistances, are not able
to perform; and therefore how trivial and slight soever a thing may seem be∣fore
the Use and Application thereof be known, especially to such as have
no occasion or curiosity for such Inquiries, or who have not consider'd the
Consequencies that may be drawn therefrom, yet to such as really have, I
doubt not but they will find Reason to think them valuable. Of this Nature
were the little Globules of Glass apply'd to the use of Microscopes, from
whence have proceeded most of those curious Discoveries made by the inqui∣sitive
Mr. <HI>Lieuwenhook,</HI> I could instance in the Pendulum, and several other
such Applications of things, in themselves inconsiderable, to proper purposes,
which have produc'd admirable Discoveries, which would hardly have been
done without them; but that would be too tedious for such an Assembly, who
are already well acquainted with them.</P>
<P>That which I shall acquaint you with at present,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great use of the Suns Rays let into a dark Room.</NOTE> is an Experiment or Me∣thod
rather, by which several very considerable Discoveries may be made
both in Nature and Art. It is, in short, a way of contracting a very consi∣derable
quantity of the Rays of the Sun into a very small Point or Space, the
smaller the better, from which they issuing again with great Brightness and
Radiancy may be able, by the differing Refraction and Reflection which those
<PB N="474" REF="453"/>
Rays suffer in their way, to describe upon a smooth, white plain the true shape
of the Body interpos'd between that radiating Point, and that smooth ex∣panded
white Plain. This in itself is very plain and obvious, and is very lit∣tle
differing from the way now commonly known, it being no other than the
fitly placing one or two Convex Glasses against an hole cut in the Shutter of
the Window of a darkn'd Room, so as that the Rays of the Sun may pass in
through the same directly and be collected into a Focus, and from thence a∣gain
spread and diverge into the Room, so to as be cast upon the Table afore∣said.
The Experiment itself, tho' I cannot now exhibit, yet there are sever∣al
of this Honourable Society who have seen and been witnesses of some of its
Effects. Tho' there are many more yet behind which I shall hereafter shew, so
soon as the Sun comes in the Room I have fit for it.</P>
<P>By this then I discover various motions of the Medium or Air, not other∣wise
visible, as also the Emanation of Steams out of Bodies of several kinds
not otherwise visible; likewise several other Natural motions of transparent
Bodies, not otherwise, that I know of, to be seen.</P>
<P>By this you plainly see the matter of a burning Candle or Lamp, which is
dissolv'd by, and mix'd with the Air, to ascend from the same like a great
Stream of Water running at the Tail of a Sluce or Bridge, which doth also
plainly illustrate the appearances of the Blaze of Comets.</P>
<P>These are some of the uses of it for discovery of the Operations of Na∣ture.</P>
<P>Next, for the uses of it in Art; it most respects the Art of Painting and
Statuary, as by this may be drawn the exact out Lines of any Body that is to
be describ'd on a Plain, and these truly as they do appear to the Eye plac'd
at convenient distance, as that of a Man's Head, Face, Hands, or Body,
in which it is so curious, that every Hair that appears without the solid part of
the Head, Hand, or Body, is truly represented in its Place and Magnitude.</P>
<P>By this the out-lines of Birds, Beasts, Shells, Fishes may be taken: As
also <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he true shape of small Plants as they are whole and intire, or the Leaves
Flowers, Seeds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of greater Plants.</P>
<P>By this the true out Lines of a Flower-pot, with all the variety of the
Postures of the Flowers that compose it, may be represented and drawn; all
which are very useful for Painters, or such as would draw such Delineations.</P>
<P>By the help of this, and a pair of Compasses, may be truly drawn all Pa∣rabolas,
Hyperbolas, and Ellipses, which are of good use in projections of
the Sphaere, Dialling, Perspective, and the like.</P>
<P>There are several other uses that may be made of this Experiment or Me∣thod,
which I omit at present, 'till I can exhibit again the Experiment.</P>
<P>And I have contracted this Discourse that I might only summ up the Uses
and Applications thereof, without spending your time in hearing the Causes
and Reasons thereof.</P>

THe following Discourses were read the later end of the Year 1684, and contain
several Matters relating to the former Subject of Navigation; there is in
the beginning a Repitition of some things formerly treated of, which could not well
be struck out, without breaking the thread of the Discourse; and the most part of the
Author's Treatises in this Volume, being Lectures read at several times, it was
necessary for him to make some Repetition of what had been before said for the better
understanding of what was to follow; nor could they have been omitted here without
a nem Modelling and Epitomizing the whole, which made me rather trespass upon
the Reader's Patience, than attempt to Alter or Abridge any thing of the Author's
Sense; and indeed I thought it more advisable to give them as he left them, than ad∣venture
upon such an undertaking.</P>
<P>This treats first of the Nature and Generation of a Globular Figure and its Pro∣prieties.
Of the Circles of the Terrestrial Globe. Of the Prime Meridian. Of the
Parallels. Whether the Perpendiculars respest the Earths Center. Of the Variation,
and its unfitness for finding the Longitude. Of the change of the Latitude
and Longitude of Places. Why the Circles have been divided into three hundred
and sixty Degrees. Of the difference between the Eastern and Western Literati. A
new Duodecimal Progression propos'd. Several Maxims laid down, and several ways
for finding a true Meridian and the Latitude.</P>

<P>I Have, in some former Lectures in this place, explain'd in general the Art
of Navigation, shewing by what Helps and Methods, and from what
Principles the Navigator may be able to direct his Course through the Ocean
to the place design'd, and at any time to be able to know in what part of
the Sea his Vessel is Sailing.</P>
<P>For the performing of which I shew'd in general,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Requisites for a Navigator</NOTE> that it was requisite that
our Navigator should, First, Be very well skill'd in Geography, or the true
description of the Earth and Sea, upon the Surface of which he is to make
and compute his Course. And, Secondly, That he should be very knowing
in all those Particulars, which may serve him for Marks or Directions to know
and distinguish the Parts one from another.</P>
<P>In order to understand the description of the Earth more effectually for this
purpose, it will be requisite to determine,</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Four things to be determin'd.</NOTE> The Figure of the Body of the Earth, and the several Proprieties
belonging to that Figure, that so we may the better be able to comprehend
the difference between a curve and a plain Superficies, and what Lines will be
useful to be drawn or suppos'd on it, and from the knowledge of those be
the better able to find and determine,</P>
<P>In the Second place, the Magnitude of this Body by known Measures,<MILESTONE N="2"/>
and to examine and prove the Ways and Methods of measuring the same;
both such as have been already either experimented or invented, and such o∣thers
as may be thought of or try'd for the future; for upon a true know∣ledge
of these two are founded all the other Superstructures in this Art; these
two cannot be truly and exactly obtain'd without a clear knowledge.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Of the motions of this Body, and what Effects are thereby pro∣duc'd<MILESTONE N="3"/>
pertinent to this purpose, namely, what Circular and other Lines are
thereby design'd, and ought to be understood on the Surface of the Earth.</P>
<P>The motions of this Body are either Total or Partial; the Total are,
First, Gravitation. Secondly, Magnetisme. Thirdly, Rotation upon its
own Axis. Fourthly, Circumvolutation about the Sun Excentrically. Fifth∣ly,
Menstrual, Cycloeidation or Undulation. Sixthly, Libration. The
Partial are either of the Water or Air; of the Water are, First, The ge∣neral
motion of the Seas, as, First, Currents. Secondly, The Tides, or of
Rivers running into the Seas. Of the Air are either constant, or, Secondly,
<PB N="476" REF="455"/>
The uncertain Winds, and both of them either Moderate or Excessive all
which ought, as near as may be, to be brought to a Standard of Mensuration,
without which all the Art we hitherto know or make use of, will not sufficient∣ly
inable us to keep a true Reckoning or Account of the Ships way in passing
or crossing the Seas, or how we change our Situation Eastward or Westward,
especially in respect of the fix'd parts of the Earth; for 'tis one thing to
measure our way through the Superficial Parts of the Body of the Water in
which we float, and another thing to know how great a part, and upon what
Point or Azymuth we have pass'd over the Earth at the bottom of the Sea;
the parts of the Earth at the bottom remaining fix'd and steady, but the
Water of the Sea being carry'd various ways, and with differing Velocity over
the same, in several parts of it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="4"/>Fourthly, The differing Substances of which the Superficial Parts of this
Body consists, as of Earth, Water, Air, and the several Extents, Bounda∣ries,
and Qualities of each, and how posited with respect to the Caelestial Bo∣dies
and proper Motions of the Earth; that is, as to Longitude and Lati∣tude,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> for without the assistance of Caelestial Observation, we have not as
yet helps sufficient to distinguish the Superficial Parts of the Earth one from
another, at least not upon the Sea where there are no Land-marks to be dis∣cover'd.</P>
<P>Having already treated in the foregoing Lectures of the several Opinions
touching the true form of the Earth, I shall not now repeat any of them
here, but proceed to shew several other Properties thereof necessary to be
known, in order to the better understanding the Subject in Hand, <HI>The Art of
Navigation;</HI> and, in the first place,</P>
<P>Supposing it, as 'tis believ'd by most, tho' prov'd by none, to be of a per∣fect
Globular Figure, and consequently the Surface of the Sea, as well
as that of the Land, to be Sphaerical, we will in the next place proceed to
consider of the Proprieties of this Body, because 'tis upon the Surface of
this Body that all our Voyages and Mensurations are to be made and not
upon a Plain; for tho' the level or the Sea doth, to a vulgar Eye, seem to be
a Plain, and generally most common People do believe or suppose it to be so,
yet 'tis past dispute that it is Sphaeroeidical, and has a Curviture answer∣able
to the Curvity of the Superficies of the Earth, tho' it be not so easily
found by the prospect of the naked Eye.</P>
<P>And that we may the better find out and examine the Properties thereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The properties of a Globular Figure.</NOTE>
it will be sit to consider how a Sphaerical or Globular Figure is generated. I
need not premise either Definition, Postulata or Axioms for this Explication,
because so much, as I have here occasion to mention, will be easily enough un∣derstood
without them, and common words of Expression will be significant
and defin'd enough for this purpose.</P>
<P>A Sphaerical or Globular Superficies may be conceiv'd to be generated by
the Conversion and whole Revolution of a Semiperiphery upon its Diameter;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Globular Su∣perficies how generated.</NOTE>
and a Globular Body may be conceiv'd, generated by a whole Revolution of
a Semicircle upon its Diameter: As, let ACB represent a Diameter bisect∣ed
at C, and upon the Center C, and distance AC. Let ADB represent a
Semiperiphery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Table <HI>IX.</HI> Fig. 6.</NOTE> every Point of which is equally distant from the Center C;
suppose then this Periphery to be revolv'd round upon the Diameter AB
remaining fix'd, this Periphery shall describe a Globular or Sphaerical Super∣ficies,
every Point of which Superficies shall be equally distant from the Cen∣ter
C; for since the Sphaerical Superficies is describ'd by the Rotation of the
Periphery ADB, no one Point of it can be further from, or nearer to the
Center C, than any one Point of the Semiperiphery ADB; but every Point
of the Semiperiphery ADB is equally distant from the Center C; therefore e∣very
Point of the whole Sphaerical Surface so generated, is equally distant
from the Center C; this distance is always equal to the Semidiameter of the
Periphery, <HI>viz.</HI> AC, or CB.</P>
<P><PB N="477" REF="456"/>
Next by this Rotation upon the Diameter AB, every Point in the Semipe∣riphery<MILESTONE N="2"/>
ADB will describe a Circle in the Spherical Surface: All which Cir∣cles
are parallel to each other; for since that any two of them are describ'd
by two Points of the Semiperiphaery, which two Points retain the same di∣stance
or place in the Semiperiphery for the whole Revolution, and that
That distance is the shortest that can be measur'd upon the Sphaerical Sur∣face,
it follows that any two of them will be parallel, and since one of the
two may always be one and the same Circle, and any other Circle may be the
other, it follows that all these Circles, so describ'd, will be parallel to each
other</P>
<P>Thirdly, supposing from any number of Points, as EEE, how many so∣ever<MILESTONE N="3"/>
Perpendiculars, let fall or drawn to the Diameter AB, as EF, EF, EF,
which will therefore be parallel to each other, because they are all Perpendi∣cular
to the same Line, and in the same plain of the Semicircle ADB: By the
Rotation of the Semicircle ADB; every one of the Lines EF, EF, DC, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
will, describe a Circular Plain, and every one of these Plains will have its Center
in the Line AB. Thirdly, Every one of those Plains will be parallel to each
other, because the Lines describing them are parallel to each other, because
they are at right Angles with the Axis, therefore the imaginary Superficies
describ'd by them, is a Plain. Next,</P>
<P>Fourthly, The Diameter AB will be Perpendicular to each of those Plains<MILESTONE N="4"/>
and will pass the Plain in the Center thereof.</P>
<P>Fifthly, These Plains will be bigger and bigger the, nearer the Perpendi∣cular<MILESTONE N="5"/>
that, describes them, is to the Center C; and the biggest of all will be
that describ'd by DC, that being the longest Perpendicular; and because
DC is equal to AC, therefore the Circles describ'd by those as Radii, shall be
equal, that is, ADB, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Circle describ'd by the Rotation of DC;
therefore these Circles shall be great Circles, therefore great Circles shall di∣vide
the Sphaerical Superficies into two equal Parts, because AD is equal to DB,
and consequently the Sphaerical Surfaces describ'd by the Rotation of them.
Therefore all great Circles upon a Globe are equal to one another; and be∣cause
ADB is half a great Circle, the Points whereof A and B remain, fix'd,
whilst the Simiperiphery is revolv'd round; and so the same will pass through
every Point of the Sphaerical Surface describ'd by it, all which concur in the
Points A and B; therefore all those great Circles do bisect each other in the
Points A and B: Therefore all the lesser parallel Peripheries cut these great
Circles at right Angles, and are all bisected by them: therefore the Plains
of the lesser Circles are at right Angles with the Plain of the great Circles
that bisect them; therefore the Angles made by any two Positions of the Se∣micircle
at the Axis of its motion, make equal Angles in all the parallel Cir∣cles
and equal parts of Arches in all the Peripheries of them.</P>
<P>And because the Center C may be suppo'd to remain fix'd, and the Points A
and B may be suppos'd fix'd in any other two opposite Points of the Sphaerical
Surface already describ'd, as X and Y and the Semiperiphery ADB may be sup∣pos'd
revolv'd upon those Points or Poles as AB upon the Axis ACB, therefore
this Revolution of XDY will describe the same Sphaerical Surface with the for∣mer,
which will describe other great and lesser Circles in it; all which will
have the same Respects and Proprieties to each other, as the former had a∣mong
themselves; therefore the Plains of all great Circles pass through the
Center, the Diameters of them being always equal to the Diameter of the
Sphaere; therefore all great Circles bisect each other; therefore the Plain of
all lesser Circles cut or pass through the Globe beside the Center; therefore
all Plains passing through or cutting the Globe, cut it in Circles, and if
they pass through the Center cut it in great Circles, and if they pass beside
and not through the Center, cut it in lesser Circles, therefore all lesser Circles
are parallel to some great Circle, which is in the middle between the Poles
A and B; therefore the same Points that are the Poles of a great Circle, are
<PB N="478" REF="457"/>
the Poles also of the lesser Circles that are parallel to it; therefore all Sphae∣rical
Surfaces that intersect each other, do cut each other in the Periphery
of a Cricle, and consequently in a Plain; therefore the Line drawn between
the Centers of two such interfering Globes shall pass the Center of that Plain
at right Angles or Perpendicularly.</P>
<P>These Proprieties of a Globular Body and Sphaerical Surface, which follow as
Corollaries from the way of the Generation of them, and so need little Ex∣planation
for the evidencing the demonstration of them, will be sufficient at
present for the Explanation of such Divisions and imaginary Circular Lines
as have been made use of by Geographers, for the better Description, Limi∣tation
and Division of the Superficial parts of this great Globe of the Earth;
as for the other kinds of Lines which are not Circular but Sphaerohelical, such
as the Rhumbs or Magnetical Lines, those I shall hereafter discourse of in
their proper places, and explain all those Proprieties which are peculiar to
them, and of use in Navigation.</P>
<P>Geographers then have represented this great Globous Body of the Earth
by a great round Ball or Globe, whose Surface is Sphaerical and Smooth, and
on the Surface of that they have describ'd the various parts of the Superficies
of the Earth bearing such Form, Position, Magnitude and Variety one to
another, as the real parts of the Earth do one with another; and therein
have taken notice of the Position, Shape, Magnitude and Boundaries of all
Lands, and Continents, Islands, Peninsulas, Isthmus's, Promonotories, Moun∣tains,
Plains, Deserts, and other remarkable differences, as are known, of the
parts of the Earth which appear above the Water; as also of all the Boun∣daries
and Extents of Oceans, Seas, Gulphs, Bays, Channels, Streights,
Lakes, Rivers, and the like; where the Water covereth the Face of the
Earth; as the best Discoveries hitherto made, can furnish them with the in∣formation
of. These, I say, they have delineated and describ'd upon a Glo∣bous
Body with what exactness and skill they are able; and tho' I conceive
it to be far from that fulness, exactness and truth of Representation that is
to be wish'd; yet comparing what is now known and describ'd, with what
was known to the Antients, we shall find more than a new World has been
of late Ages discover'd: And indeed the very World itself; for 'twas a
long time before it was known what the Figure or Magnitude of the Earth
was; and there was a time, when the beleif of Antipodes was accounted and
punish'd as a Heresy. Every one then believ'd his own Country to be the
middle of the Plain of the Earth, and that the utmost Limits of it, which
touch'd the Vault of Heaven, were the Sea, into which the Sun, Moon and
Stars descended when they Set, and out of which they ascended again when
they Rose; and the utmost extent of Land seem'd no more than what a
Conqueror was, in a little time, able to over run and vanquish.</P>
<P>It is hard t conceive,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earths Fi∣gure first found by the Greek Mathematici∣ans.</NOTE> how Men from such a state of Ignorance should ar∣rive
at such a degree of certainty of Knowledge, as the World has at present
attain'd; how they came to know that the Earth was a round or globular Bo∣dy;
nor have we any Histories that do inform us; but we first met with it a∣mong
the Mathematical Philosophres of the Greeks, who, 'tis probable,
from the curiosity of their Caelestial Observations, and from the strictness of
their Arguing came to find and demonstrate the truth thereof; and then to in∣deavour
to find out also the certain Magnitude and Measure thereof by Ob∣servations
and Mensurations purposely made. These Caelestical Observations,
I conceive, were the first occasions of their discovery of the true Form of the
Earth, and 'tis by means of those that the Magnitude of it hath been, and
is to be truly discover'd, there being so many unanswerable Objections against
all the other ways of attempting it, that I think it wholly impracticable to
any tolerable degree of certainty.</P>
<P>Caelestial Objects then, 'tis probable, were the Marks that guided them to
this Discovery, which were sufficient for this purpose, whether they were
suppos'd to move round the Earth whilst that was suppos'd to stand still and
fix'd, or whether they were look'd on as fix'd and immoveable as to the Diur∣nal
Motion; and the Earth itself, according to <HI>Aristarchus Samius,</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> our
<PB N="479" REF="458"/>
late <HI>Copernicus,</HI> were suppos'd to be whirl'd round upon an Axis once in twen∣ty
four Hours.</P>
<P>Beofre the revival of this Opinion the Body of the Earth, tho' accounted
but a Point in respect of the expanded Universe, yet was it suppos'd to be of
such a solid, Dense and sluggish Nature, as not to be mov'd out of its place or
posture, tho' the whole Universe, which was so many Millions of Millions
of times bigger and more noble, was suppos'd to whirle about it with an in∣credible
Velocity, and all to wait and administer to it; which yet at the same
time was said to be damn'd to the worst of places (as it was accounted) the
Center of the whole Creation, where it was affirm'd to the made up of the ve∣ry
Dreggs and Dross of the <HI>Chaos,</HI> to which all the vile and baser parts of
the Universe continually descended, and was there excluded, as it were, and
thrown out of the very Communication of the rest of the Creation. To
maintain this Opinion the whole Creation was strangely Metamorphos'd, the
most glorious Caelestial Bodies were depriv'd of their greatest Powers and the
best places of the Universe: First, For their Powers they were rarify'd al∣most
to be no Bodies, and suppos'd more light and spungy than Air itself;
and next they were wholly depriv'd of the Power of Motion, so as to be
suppos'd to be carry'd about by certain Orbs, in which they were suppos'd
plac'd and in them to be only Passive and not Active at all; and thus as sit∣ting
in Chariots to be whirl'd round this despicable Point of the Earth, for
the more State and Pomp. On the other side to make this seem more pro∣bable,
the whole <HI>Expansum</HI> or <HI>Aether</HI> was consolidated into more than ada∣mantine
Hardness and Transparency, and divided into Sphaeres or Orbs
within Orbs Concentrical, Excentrical, Progressive, Retrograde, and together
with these qualities of Hardness and Transparency, there was added to this
Substance that fill'd the Aethereal space so great a smoothness, as that all these
Orbs could pass by each other without loosing any part of their motion by
rubbing, and such an impenetrability as not to wear out or wast each other by
Grinding or Fretting; and yet to heighten the wonder they were suppos'd to
be Sonorous and Tonick, and to out-do all the Musick besides in the World,
by the harmonious Melody of the Symphonick Sphaeres; which Harmony
yet was so sublime as not be to heard or understood by any but such as were
gone out of themselves and had left those Corporeal Senses which other Mor∣tals
here make use of, behind them, and were transported into an Exstacy of
Contemplation and Attention. By this contrivance the Universe was all
made solid impenetrable, except only what space was left below the Con∣cave
part of the Moon's Orbe, which Concave part was the inside of the
Walls of this Prison to which the Earth was condemned, beyond which no
Terrestial Matter could penetrate, nor any Earthly Power reach; nor in∣deed
could they reach so far, because this Concave Superficies was lin'd with a
very thick Coat of the Element of Fire which had Power to consume and
disperse all that which rising from the Earth, or inferior Regions of the Air,
should attempt to invade and penetrate the Heavens. Thence Comets or
Blazing Stars were suppos'd Sublunary and Aereal Meteors, and to be kindl'd
by this Guardian Element of the Fire, and by that to be variously thrown from
place to place like other Meteors and falling Stars, retorting their ill influence
back again to the Earth from whence they were sent; or like Squibbs and
Powder-Serpents drove to and fro by the blaze of their own Tail. Thus
former Artificers contriv'd the Heavens into Wheel-work, and supposing
themselves to have establish'd their Machinations by Suppositions, which freed
them from the fear of Discovery or Contradiction they did a long while a∣muse
the World with their Hypotheses. But later Astronomers finding, by
accurate Observations, that Comets did pervade all those spaces which they
had fill'd up, began to discover their Fictions to be groundless, and soon af∣ter
found out a much more probable Solution of all the Phaenomena of the
Heavens, by placing the Sun in the Center of the Planetary System<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and
instead of whirling round the Heavens once in twenty four Hours, they found
or believ'd at least, that the Body of the Earth itself turning round upon one
of its Diameters as an Axis, caus'd all those appearances of change, which
was formerly ascrib'd to the motions of the Heavens, suppos'd to be causs'd
<PB N="480" REF="459"/>
by the rapidity of the Sphaere call'd the <HI>Primum Mobile;</HI> but taking which
Supposition we will, as to what principally concerns the distinguishing of Lon∣gitude
and Latitude in Geography, it will come much to the same thing.</P>
<P>We suppose then that the Earth is, by all common Observations, found to
be a round Body, and suppos'd to be mov'd round upon two Points in its Sur∣face
or upon an imaginary Axis or Diameter of it, and that it makes a whole
Revolution to the same Position again in respect of the Plain through the Sun
once it twenty four Hours thereby making Night Day; and supposing an
imaginary Plain passing through the Center of the Sun and the two Polar
Points of this motion, this Plain will describe upon the Surface of the Earth
every moment that it moves a great Circle, and so in a Revolution infinite
of great Circles passing through the Polar Points and dividing the whole Sur∣face
of the Earth into a Morning and Afternoon half; the Morning half will
be that which is moving towards the Sun, and the Evening half that which is
moving from it: These great Circles are call'd Meridians, because when a∣ny
Point of the Surface of the Earth comes by its motion into this Plain, the
Sun is in the Meridian of that place, and are usually drawn in Lines upon the
Globe which is made to represent the Earth; but because to draw them all
would perfectly cover the Surface of the Globe, there being no moment pas∣sing
without an alteration of it in respect of the Superficial Parts of the Earth,
therefore on smaller Globes they usually draw but twelve of them, which di∣vides
the whole Surface into twenty four parts answerable to the Hours of
the Day and Night, but in greater Globes they treble that number answer∣able
to every third part of an Hour or twenty Minutes of time.</P>
<P>And because these imaginary Circles alter every moment, and all have the
same respect to the Heavens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the prime Meridian.</NOTE> so that from thence there is no reason why
they should not be drawn over some places as well as others, that there
might be a certainty where to begin to number them; there hath been sever∣al
attempts or profers by several Authors to place under that which they call
their first or beginning Meridian, this or that remarkable place of the Earth.
<HI>Ptolomy</HI> accounted his first Meridian from one Degree West of the Wester∣most
<HI>Fortunate Islands</HI> or the <HI>Canarys,</HI> and thence accounted his Longitude or
distance Eastward, 'till he arriv'd to the Easter-most Border of <HI>China,</HI> sup∣posing
thereby to have compris'd all the Habitable part of the World.</P>
<P>Upon the farther discoveries of late times of Lands more to the Westward
than these <HI>Canaries;</HI> some have taken the Meridian passing through the Island
of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> one of the Islands of <HI>Cape Verd.</HI> And <HI>Hondius</HI> has chosen for
his first Meridian that which passes through the Island of St. <HI>Jago;</HI> but <HI>Ger∣rardus
Mercator</HI> has plac'd his first Meridian over the Island of <HI>Corvo,</HI> one of
the <HI>Azores,</HI> because at that time the Magnetical Needle or Compass had no
variation from the true Meridian Line in that place, which he therefore
judg'd would be a very good mark to find it again in succeeding Ages: But
as there are other Meridians in which the Compass has no variation, so it
has been since his time found that there is a variation of the variation of the
Magnetical Needle; and tho' the Needle then varied here at <HI>London</HI> to the
Eastward, yet since that time, <HI>viz.</HI> about thirty Years since, had no varia∣tion
here at <HI>London,</HI> and is now very considerably gone towards the West.
Some others have made the first Meridian that which pass'd by the most East∣wardly
part of <HI>Brasile; Arnoldus,</HI> and <HI>Wendelinus</HI> have chosen the Island of St.
<HI>Vincent</HI> for their first Meridian; and <HI>Jodocus Hondius</HI> has taken the same in
his Globe making it pass through <HI>Iceland; Robert Dudley</HI> in his <HI>Arcano del
Mare</HI> places it at the Island of <HI>Pico</HI> one of the <HI>Azores;</HI> but <HI>Gulielmus Blaw,</HI> and
most of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Mapp makers, begin their reckoning from the Pike of
<HI>Teneriff.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> Geographers, by order of <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIIIth. in the Year
1634, plac'd their first Meridian to pass through the Island of <HI>Ferro</HI> one of
the <HI>Canaries,</HI> as is testify'd by <HI>Brietius</HI> in his Parallel between the Antient
and Modern Geography, much the same with that of <HI>Ptolomy.</HI> Another
prime Meridian was constituted by Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the first, as a Boundary be∣tween
the <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>Portuguese</HI> Division or Conquest of the World, and that
was after a long Debate, but never any final Decision or Determination sup∣pos'd
to pass through the Mouth of the River of <HI>Amazons</HI> and that of <HI>De
<PB N="481" REF="460"/>
la Platta,</HI> as <HI>Langrenus</HI> has made it in his Mapp (which, whether they lie both
under one Meridian or not, no one yet knows) And the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were to be
proprietors of all Lands they discover'd to the Westwards of that Meridian,
and the <HI>Portuguese</HI> all to the Eastward; but these two meeting each other in
the <HI>East-Indies</HI> again, caus'd much Dispute. However, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> keep the
<HI>Philippines,</HI> tho' it be thought to intrench upon the <HI>Portuguese</HI> half. Other
Geographers have taken other beginnings, which has caus'd a very great Con∣fusion,
in particular Geographical Mapps, it being difficult to know from
what prime Meridian they begin their Account.</P>
<P>Besides these, the Astronomers have made choice of other Meridians for their
Astronomical Calculations, as <HI>Ticho Brahe,</HI> and his followers, take the Meridi∣an
of <HI>Vranibourg,</HI> being in <HI>Huena</HI> an Island in the <HI>Sound. Origanus</HI> takes that
of <HI>Frankfort, Maginus</HI> that of <HI>Venetia, Eichstadius</HI> that of <HI>Stettn,</HI> and indeed
almost every new Writer makes the Meridian of the place of his abode the
first Meridian, and refers all the rest to that, which breeds a great and need∣less
Trouble and Confusion in Geography; and it were very much to be wish∣ed
that they had, or would for the future agree upon some one to which all
might be refer'd. There is not yet found any very considerrble ground in
Nature why one should be agreed to rather than another; that of the di∣rection
of the Magnetical Needle in the true Meridian Line would have look∣ed
so much like such an indication of Nature, if the Hypothesis of <HI>Linton</HI>
and <HI>Nantonier</HI> had been true; but since Time has discover'd that those were
but groundless Hypotheses, that pretence is vain.</P>
<P>That of the prodigious high Mountain of the Pike of <HI>Tenariff,</HI> which <HI>Wil∣liam
Bleaw</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> take notice of in their Charts, is likely enough to
be a lasting Mark, and 'tis considerable enough to distinguish it from all o∣ther
Mountains yet known in the World; and lying conveniently in the
way of Shipping, may, for ought I know, be as proper as any other place
whatsoever, provided all agree to make their Compute from it; and the com∣puting
Eastwards may serve well enough since it is now generally us'd, but
had it been to be now establish'd, I should think it had been much more ac∣cording
to Nature to have computed the contrary way.</P>
<P>Next, the Earth being suppos'd to be mov'd round upon this Axis, may
be suppos'd to have infinite Circles describ'd upon the Surface of it, by the in∣finite
Points of the great Circle that thus it moves round withal, which
will therefore be parallel to one another, because all are describ'd by the same
motion upon the Axis; that Point of it which is in the middle between the
two Poles describeth a great Circle, which is call'd the Aequator or Aequi∣noctial
Line,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Parrl∣les.</NOTE> and all the other Circles will be lesser Circles, which being
parallel to it are call'd Parallels; all these Circles cross the former Meridi∣ans
at right Angles, and so every one of them are, by every one of the for∣mer,
divided into two equal parts.</P>
<P>These parallel Circles are drawn upon the Globe that represents the
Earth, but not all of them, for that would cover the whole superficies of
the Globe, but only so many of them as may, together with the Meridians,
serve to distinguish and divide the Surface thereof into Trapezia of a conveni∣nent
bigness, and are generally proportion'd to the number of Semimeri∣dians,
<HI>viz.</HI> so many between the Aequinoctial, and either Pole, as there are
Meridians, as at every Five, Ten, or Fifteen Degrees distance from the Ae∣quinoctial
Circle, from which they begin to be accounted.</P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 13th. 84. I explain'd the last Day various Opinions concerning the Fi∣gure
of the Earth on which we live, and shew'd you why, tho' it has not
been sufficiently prov'd by any Observations yet made, that it is positively
of this or that Figure, yet by comparing all together it seems most probable
that the Figure of it is Sphaerical or Globular, or at least so near it as not
easily to be discover'd of any other, by the shadow of it in the Eclipses of the
Moon, nor by any other Observations yet made for measuring the Quantity
or Magnitude of a Degree upon the Surface of it, which is the only certain
and positive way of performing it: For tho' 'tis certain that the quantity of a
Degree, or a three hunder'd and sixtieth part of the whole compass of it has been
measur'd in several Latitudes, and some of them with care enough; yet 'tis
<PB N="482" REF="461"/>
also certain, that most of them have been made by unaccurate Methods and
uncertain Measures; so that they are wholly useless in this particular, by
reason we cannot make a pertinent comparison between them; nor do I
know any other certain and uncontradictable way of proving it, than by either
first actually measuring the quantity of a Degree upon the Earth in Latitudes
very differing, as of one lying very near the Aequinoctial Line, and of an∣other,
as near as may be towards either of the Poles; and those Mensurations
to be made as near as may be by the same Persons, with the same Instru∣ments,
and the same Measures, and with the same Exactness and Care; by
the comparing together of which two Degrees so measur'd, it would plainly
appear whether those Degrees would prove equal or unequal; for if they
prov'd to be unequal, then it would plainly appear that the Figure of the
Earth was not of a perfect Globular Form, but some way or other Oval; if
the Degree near the Aequinoctial be found longer than near the Pole,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Away to deter∣mine the Earths two Diameters.</NOTE> then
the greatest Diameters of the Earth are in the Plain of the Aequinoctial; if
on the contrary, then the longest Diameter is in the Axis of its Revolution:
This is supposing that the Perpendicular Lines pass through the Center of the
Earth, whence would follow a second method of examining the Figure of it,
and that is by examining whether the Horizontal Line be at right Angles
with the Perpendicular; for if the Perpendicular be not found at right An∣gles
with the visible Horizon, then will the obtuse Angle be on that side of
the Perpendicular which is next the longest Diameter of the Earth, and the
Acute towards that which is the shortest; it may therefore be easily try'd
upon the same Place or Promontory where the Horizontal Line of the Sea
can be seen both Northwards and Southwards with some exact Instrument
fitted with a long Plumb-line and a large Telescope set at right Angles with
it, by which the visible Horizontal Line may be observ'd to what exactness
it shall be desir'd, by turning the Instrument in the same place, and viewing
the level of the said Line through it Northward and Southward. But if up∣on
examining the Horizontal Line this way, it shall be found that the Per∣pendicular
is at right Angles with the Horizontal, and yet by the other way
of trial, by measuring a Degree in several Latitudes, it be found that the
Degrees are differing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whether the Perpendiculars respect the Cen∣ter.</NOTE> it will be an Argument that the Perpendiculars do not
always respect the Center of the Earth, but that they cross the Axis in some
other part thereof, which is out of the middle, sometimes towards one Pole,
sometimes towards the other; which may be true, and yet none of the Obser∣vers,
that have hitherto been, may have found, or taken notice thereof; one
Reason of which may have been, that they have not hitherto suspected it, and
therefore did not inquire after it. But tho' it he probable enough, that the
Body of the Earth is nearly Globular, or rather was so form'd at first, that
being the most perfect and regular Figure, and that, of which the other Ce∣lestial Bodies seem to be of, yet since we find that there are other varieties in
Nature, as that of the Ring about the Body of <HI>Saturn,</HI> and even here upon
the Earth, that of the differing Variation of the Magnetical Power there∣of,
I think it may not be improper to suspect, that there may be such an un∣certainty
of pointing in the Perpendicular or Plumb-line, 'till by certain Ob∣servations
we are assur'd, and 'tis not safe in Philosophy to leave inquiry 'till
a certainty be found. It was for some time believ'd, that the Earth itself
was a great Load-stone, and that the Poles thereof were the same with the
Poles of its diurnal Motion; and that the variation of the Needle from that
North Point was occasion'd only by the approximation to the sides of great
Continents, and according to that Theory, the causes of the several varia∣tions
of the Needle at several places were assign'd to be for this or that Con∣tinent,
or this or that Ocean near adjoyning.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Needle respects not the Poles of diur∣nal motion.</NOTE> But upon further Inquiry it
was found that there were several Instances, that contradicted that Theory,
and that the Needle seem'd to respect some Poles that were not in the Poles
of the diurnal Motion, but at some distance from them: These were said
to be some vast great Rocks or Mountains of Load-stone at certain distances
from the Poles of the diurnal motion; which Poles the Needle was suppos'd
always to respect, and thereupon <HI>William Nautonier</HI> of <HI>Castlefrank</HI> in <HI>Langue∣dock,</HI>
wrote a large Book, which he Printed in the Year 1603, wherein he
<PB N="483" REF="462"/>
describes his Theory thereof, and furnishes it with Instruments and Tables
fitted to find the Longitude thereby.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Variation un∣fit for finding the Longitude.</NOTE> Much about the same time one Mr.
<HI>Anthony Linton,</HI> our own Country-man, a Minister I suppose, Publish'd
small Tract in <HI>English,</HI> under the Title of <HI>News of the Complement of the Art
of Navigation,</HI> in which he pretended to shew a way for discovering the Lon∣gitude
by the help of the variation of the Needle, and goes upon the same
Hypothesis that the Earth was one great round Load-stone, and that the Poles
thereof where at a certain distance from the Poles of the World, or those of
the diurnal Motion; that there were, as it were, proper Magnetical Meri∣dians,
and a Magnetical Aequator and Parallels corresponding, all which
bore the same respects to the Magnetical Poles, that the Meridians, Aequa∣tor,
and Parallels of the diurnal Motion did to the Poles of the World; and
thence he shews a way how to find the Longitude of any place by Sea or
Land, in the Day or Night. But later Observations have found, that this
Magnetical Variation varies, tho' yet the parts of the Earth do not seem at
a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>to have alter'd their Position; this was found by Mr. <HI>Foster</HI> and others in
the Year 1635.</P>
<P>Here <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mr. <HI>Bond</HI> makes a supposition, that these Magnetical Poles
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Air, not in the Earth, and out of the Poles of the World at a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> distance from them, and that they were two, one North and an∣other
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> South; that the Magnetical Axis cross'd the other Axis in the Center,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at the Poles made a Revolution about the Poles of the Earth in a cer∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n
period of Time, but that at the same time all over the World the Needles
respected these Poles both by variation and dipping; by this he suppos'd the
Longitude might be found in the same manner as <HI>Linton</HI> and <HI>Nautonnier</HI> had
before suppos'd; but by comparing several Observations together it is found
that this.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Four Magneti∣cal Poles.</NOTE> Theory will not hold neither. And the ingenious Mr. <HI>Halley</HI> has
examin'd and compar'd Observations so far, that he judges it reasonable to
admit four Magnetical Poles in the Earth, two of which are near the South,
and two others near the North Pole, by which he finds the most accurate
Observations of variation will be solv'd very rationally.</P>
<P>These Instances I mention to shew that tho' the Supposition of Dr. <HI>Gilbert</HI>
were very ingenious, and seem'd very rational, and in many things agreed
with the Phaenomena of the terrella or round Load-stone; yet was it not a
sufficient Argmment for all others to disist from inquiring farther, and examin∣ing
whether upon trial all the Phaenomena would answer to the Theory, and
whether it would always remain the same that he in his time did find it;
for things of this Nature being so far remov'd from common and vulgar Ob∣servation,
and the very Maxims and Grounds of them being taken up upon
I know not whose, Credit, I conceive, it might be worth inquiry by Experi∣ment
to examine whether they be really so or not, how generally soever they
be believ'd or consented to; for 'till that be positively prov'd by certain Ob∣servations,
there may be good Reason to hesitate upon the Reception of any
Hypothesis how plausible soever it may appear.</P>
<P>This I mention on the occasion of considering the form of the Body of the
Earth, and of the pointing of the Perpendiculars to the very Central and
middle Point thereof; which, tho' it be generally taken for granted, and ve∣ry
agreeable to the general Phaenomena, yet I think there are very good Ar∣guments
may be produc'd that may make the thing questionable, since I do
not find that there has ever yet been made any Observations or Trials ac∣curate
enough to determine positively whether it be certainly so, or other∣wise.
'Tis true, that it is certainly near enough to that Figure of a Globe,
that the common Observations and accounts of Seamen cannot disprove it;
and therefore as to that use, and so far as the acurateness of that Art is
hitherto practis'd, it can make no sensible difference; but yet if that Art be
carry'd to a much higher degree of Perfection, as 'tis not impossible but that
it may, it may be very considerable in that particular also: But 'till that be
done we will be contented to agree to the common receiv'd Opinion, and con∣sider
of it as of a Globe perfectly round, at least as to the Surface of the O∣cean,
that part which is of principal consideration in the business of Navi∣gation.</P>

<HEAD>A Discourse of the Magnetical Variation, read <DATE>July 7th. 1686.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>THe causes of Gravity and Magnetical Attraction are so far remov'd be∣yond
the reach of our Senses, that the greatest part of Philosophers
who have indeavour'd to give us an information thereof, have rather made us
more sensible of their and our own Ignorance and Inability to do any thing
therein, some making it Corporeal, some Spiritual; but what either of them
mean either by Corpuscles or Magnetical Effluvia, or Atoms, or Magnetick
Vertue, or Hylarchick Spirit, or Anima Mundi, when you come to inquire
to the bottom you find, that neither they nor we know what is meant, and
we do as good as say 'tis so, because it is so; the Reason of which I conceive
to be, that Men are usually very impatient of the Labour of examining and
trying, and of going the long and tedious way of coming to a certainty of
knowledge by Experiments, wherein the progress is very slow, and, as it
were, step by step; but affect rather to leap into a Theory at once, and make
to themselves an Hypotehesis upon some few Observations they have met with,
of some few Experiments they have try'd, or some pretty Conception or Hypo∣thesis
they have accidently pitch'd upon that pleases them, to which with a
little Shouldring they can make every cast to run, as it were, directly, though
at last it miss the mark; yet, rather than they will indure the trouble of far∣ther
search by Trials or by Examinations and strict Reasonings, they are
contented to take up with somewhat that may serve to amuse.</P>
<P>It was for some time believ'd, that the Magnetical Needle did always re∣spect
the North and South Poles, not of the Earth, but of the Heavens,
and that the Pole-star was that wherein the vertue did lie. In process of
time it comes to be discover'd, that this' vertue was not in the Heavens, but
in the Earth, and that the Magnetical Needle, had, in some parts of the
World, a considerable variation from the Meridian of the place, the North
end declining in this part towards the East, in that towards the West, in
some places more, in others less; but that this variation was fix'd and per∣petual
to the place, and that by reason, said some, for that there were to be
found in the North certain Rocks of Mountains of Load-stones, which at∣tracted
the North end of the Needle to them from all parts of the World.
But this, in a short time, also vanish'd as appearing ridiculous, and not answer∣ing
to the Consequences that must have follow'd from it. Instead of which
another cause is introduc'd for the variation, and that is the great Conti∣nents
that lie either on this or that Hand, and the great Sea that lies on the
other: Hence it was suppos'd that Variation would be found always re∣gular,
and the same in the same place at all times, as proceeding from the
greater attraction from the parts of the Earth; which were more prominent
and elevated, and which were not likely to be alter'd by time; at least, not
enough to make a sensible variation of the variation. This was Dr. <HI>Gilberts,</HI>
but in process of Time was, by Mr. <HI>Gillibrand</HI> of this Colledge, and some
others, found to alter, and there was found a variation of the variation of
the Magnetick Needle in the same place, and that not verify'd in one, but
in thousands of places. This overthrew all the former Hypotheses, and we
are now to seek a new one; Mr. <HI>Bond,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Philips,</HI> and some others,
have been hammering at a new Hypothesis, wherein they make the Magne∣tick
vertue to be in the Air, and so the Magnetick Poles to be moveable
in Circles round about the Poles of the Aequinoctial, and the Mag∣netick

Axis of the Earth to have a Conical motion about the Axis of the di∣urnal
Revolution: Which Conical motion they suppose to be perform'd in
a certain number of Years; so that at length the Polar Points of the Mag∣netick
vertue after they have revolv'd a periodick Circle, return from the
same Point from which they did begin. Others have taken other Hypothe∣ses,
and rais'd other Conclusions and Consequences from them; but still af∣ter
all we are yet to seek whether this motion of the Magnetick Polar Points
be in straight Line, or in a Curve as in a Circle, Ellipse, or some other more
irregular Figure; whether it move round the diurnal Pole or some other
Point; whether it move Eastward or Westward; whether it move nearer or
farther off from the Pole; whether it move quicker at one time than another;
whether it will return or continually proceed, whether there are only two
or more Magnetical Poles; whether the Magnetical Axis of one, or Axes, if
there are more than one, pass through the Center of the Globe, or besides
it, and if more, whether parallel to each other, or Oblique, and whether one
only hath a motion or whether both; whether these motions keep the same Ve∣locities
or differing; and many other the like Queries might be made; I could
add a hundred, of which we are still to seek, and cannot give a positive an∣swer,
because there are not yet materials enough of Observations to build a
certain Theory upon; and the Observations that have been hitherto made
have been so gross and imperfect, that little of certainty can be concluded
from them, and therefore such Observations can only be rectify'd by Time,
by reason that the Degrees and Steps of this progressive motion are so far
undefin'd, that some Years must be stay'd before the alterations that are
made in the interim in the motion can be made sensible, and when sensible,
they are very imperfectly defin'd. Hence, I suppose, it may have proceeded,
that we have lately heard of some such Magnetical Observations as have
seem'd to prove a station of that motion, and some others of a differing Na∣ture,
which, in probability, have proceeded from some imperfection in the
Observation.</P>
<P>For if we consider the Nature of such Observations, how many Requisites
there are necessary to make any one as it ought to be, we shall quickly find
that our store to fit materials to work upon will be exceedingly small; and
that upon examining into or querying upon such Observations as we meet
with, we shall be apt to throw by and neglect as useless the greatest part▪
for there are but a very few in the World that are fit and able to make such
Observations, or that know what is Pertinent and what Impertinent: Fewer
there are that will be at the trouble of doing what they know fit, and tho'
Skill, and Will be joyn'd, yet if Instruments and other assistances are wanting,
they will come short of Perfection.</P>
<P>As tho' an Observer knows how to find the true meridian of the place,
how to place his Needle, what inconveniences to look after for preventing
(as the removing of all such Magnetical or Chalibeate Bodies as influence
the Needle) how to observe the Angle the Needle makes with the Meridian
Line, and the like; yet if he wants fitting Instruments, whether Mathema∣tical
or Magnetical, to do these Requisites and convenient Assistances, and
a sufficient stock of Perseverance and Industry to prosecute the trials to the
utmost exactness, the effect will be imperfect, whatever is look'd after beyond
that exactness: For instance, after all other Requisites are found, if there be
wanting such a Needle as will certainly distinguish to the sixth part of a De∣gree,
then any such Observations are wholly useless in such Inquiries where
a much greater accurateness is requir'd; and for the making them significant,
there is no other way but staying a sufficient number of Years, and the
courser the Observations be, the greater number of Years are requisite to
make them equally useful; and even then they are altogether useless for
answering many other Queries; as if it should be queried, whether the pro∣gress
for that whole interval have been equal or unequal, and if unequal,
what those Degrees have been and at what times, whether in differing Years,
or differing parts of the same Year? <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="486" REF="465"/>
Now since Time is that which cannot be alter'd, and that therefore Po∣sterity
only are like to have the Fruit of our Labours and Indeavours of that
kind, I thought it would be best to make such Instruments as would make
that sensible in a very short time, which, by the common, could not be but
in a long, by those means if possible to reduce our Observations to use with∣in
the compass of our own Lives; for if a Needle could be made that should
distinguish the alterations or the variation of the Variation, as nicely to the
parts of a Minute as the present Needles do to the parts of a Degree, then
should we discern as sensible an operation or alteration in one Year, as by the
other in threescore, and in ten Years as in six hundred; for that all other re∣quisite
accurateness can be procur'd, as to distinguish the Meridian Line,
the division of the Angles, the interposed space of time, the removal of im∣peding
or altering materials that may influence the Needles.</P>
<P>Divers have attempted to procure Instruments fit for this purpose, some
by Needles of great length, others by shorter view'd with Glasses or Micro∣scopes,
others by other ways, as by one of the late Leipsick Acta may be
seen; every of which I conceive to be sufficient for this purpose, and do
only aim to discover the divisions of the same Angle; that which I am now
describing does that indeed of Consequence, but directly and immedi∣ately
it magnifies or multiplies the Angle, by making that a Degree which is
really but a Minute, and so by consequence contracting of time.</P>
<P>'Tis then, in short, is no other but this,</P>
<P>A Needle is fix'd at right Angles upon a very light and straight Axis of
Wood or Brass, which Axis hath at each end the point of a very fine and
sharp Needle, the finer and sharper the better, which is easily enough pro∣curable:
these Needles points are to be put into two small Center holes,
made fit for them in a Ring, or Frame made after the shape in the draught.</P>
<P>THus far the Author. The Figure of the Instrument is represented in the ninth
Plate, Figure the first, which may be understood without farther Explanation,
which the Author has omitted.</P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 20. 1684. In my last Lecture I explain'd to you these two last Lines
or Circles which are usually drawn upon the Superficies of a Globe made to
represent the Body of the Earth, which were, First, All great Circle passing
through the two Polar Points of the Earth, or those Points upon which the
Body of it, or the <HI>Primum Mobile</HI> is continually mov'd round once in twenty
four Hours, or the time of a natural Day, which are call'd Meridians.
And, Secondly, All those Circular Lines, which may be suppos'd to be de∣scrib'd
by all the Points of any one such Meridian, turn'd round
upon the said Globe, suppos'd to stand still; or by the conversion of the
Globe upon its Poles, the Meridian being suppos'd to stand still, the effect
being the same in both cases, as to this particular. These Lines or Circles
are call'd Parallels, either because they are all parallel to one another, or ra∣ther
because all the lesser of them are parallel to the middlemost and great
Circle, which is call'd the Aequinoctial, Aequator, or most commonly be Sea∣men,
the Line.</P>
<P>These two sorts of Circles are the principal made use of in the Descripti∣on
of the Superficial Parts of the Earth, and to which all other Lines made
use of either in Geography, Astronomy, or Navigation are reduced, these a∣lone
serving to shew the Position and Situation of the several parts of the
Earth to one another, and to determine the positive Point or Spot upon the
Artificial Globe, every real place upon the Surface of the Earth ought to
have, and <HI>Vice Versa</HI> any place situated on the Globe may be found upon the
Earth: And being once so determin'd, 'tis suppos'd by most, that it is al∣ways
the same, that is, the same place upon the Superficies of the Earth be∣ing
once adjusted both as to its Longitude and Latitude, shall always remain
and continue the same both in respect of the one and the other Position. As
suppose this City of <HI>London,</HI> if the Latitude and Longitude be once certain∣ly
observ'd and determin'd, and so posited on the Globe, it is suppos'd that
it shall always remain and continue to have the same in all succeeding Ages,
<PB N="487" REF="466"/>
without any Variation or Deviation from the same, whatever Deviation or
Variation doth happen in the Caelestial Bodies without it. This, I say, is
suppos'd or believ'd by the most Geographers and Astronomers: But yet
not by all; for there have been, and there now are some, as particularly
Monsieur <HI>Pierre Pettit,</HI> who have not only suppos'd, but positively asserted,
that these also have a Variation, and that after a certain time both the Latitude
and Longitude of many places, upon the Surface of the Earth, hath a sen∣siable
change and difference; and to confirm this he hath compar'd many Ob∣servations
Recorded by the Antients, of the Latitude of divers places, as
particularly those of <HI>Paris, Rome,</HI> and some other eminent places with later
and modern Observations of the Latitudes of the same places;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Latitude and Longitude of places va∣ries.</NOTE> whereby 'tis
found, that there are very considerable differences between them, which he
ascribes to the variation of the Poles of the Earth. Certain it is, that la∣ter
Observations concerning the Latitudes of several very eminent places of
the World do very much differ from those that were assign'd them by the An∣tients;
as particularly that of the famous Accademy of <HI>Greece Athens,</HI> whose
present Latitude is found to differ almost two whole Degrees from what
was formerly assign'd to it, as I have been inform'd by the Ingenious and
Learn'd Traveller Mr. <HI>Francis Vernon,</HI> who with great care made the Ob∣servation.
I could instance also in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and several other eminent
places not mention'd by Monsieur <HI>Pettit,</HI> but I shall omit them at present
'till some farther and more accurate trials be made for this purpose, and up∣on
this occasion mention only, that, I conceive, it would not be amiss that
there should be some Observations purposely made to examine this Theory,
and reduce it to a certainty, for 'till that be done it is but Hypothetical to
suppose the Polar Points of the Earth fix'd or moveable, there being as great
a possibility of their moveableness, as there was of the Magnetical Poles,
before the discovery thereof made by some of this College in the Year 1635.
That, I suppose, which prompt'd Monsieur <HI>Pettit</HI> to make this assertion, or
at least gave him a hint for this Inquiry, was a kind of mistake of <HI>Joseph
Scaliger</HI> in an Epistle of his wrote to <HI>David Rivatlus</HI> upon the occasion of
the Explanation of the variation of the Magnetical Needle from the true
Meridian, made by Dr. <HI>Gilbert</HI> in his Book <HI>de Magnete,</HI> Publish'd not long
before. This Epistle was Printed with other Works of his at <HI>Paris</HI> in the
Year 1610. but written in the Year 1604 for by his Discourse he would
seem to explain the Reason of the Magnetical Variation or the Meridians
themselves, which he pretends must needs follow from the Theory of the
praecession of the Aequinoctial Points, and yet at the same time he says, that
the <HI>Cynosure</HI> or Tail of the lesser Bear was never farther from the North
Pole of the World than now it is. But in short (to spend no more time up∣on
declaring and explaining this Opinion) I say, 'tis very evident he under∣stood
not what he said himself, or if he did, 'tis certain he grosly mistook
the Explanation of the matter, and has been long since confuted by <HI>Maginus,</HI>
who was then professor of Astronomy at <HI>Padua.</HI></P>
<P>Now it there be any ground for this Opinion, then must also follow an
alteration of all the Meridians and Parallels imagin'd to be made upon this
Globe of the Earth; for if the Polar Points, or the Axis of the diurnal
motion of the Earth does vary, those must also vary with it, and conse∣quently
the Positions and Distances of all places, in respect of them, must
vary also; and consequently, as <HI>Scaliger</HI> says, the Positions or Meridians of
Dials, will, after a certain time, be false, as will also the very Dial itself,
as if it had been remov'd and plac'd in a wrong Latitude and wrong Posi∣tion.
However, the Position and distances of places one to another will
contain the same, tho' they differ in respect of the Heavens; and therefore
if those be procur'd, tho' both the Latitude and Longitude of all should be
alter'd, this Description or Picture of the Earth, upon the Artificial Globe,
would remain true and unalter'd, and other Meridians and Parallels might
be drawn over them.</P>
<P>But to leave this Digression for the present, I shall proceed to consider of
the Divisions usually made upon these Circles describ'd upon the Artificial
Globe.</P>
<P><PB N="488" REF="467"/>
All these Circles then both great and lesser are divided,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The divisions usually made on the Globe.</NOTE> or suppos'd to be
divided into three hundred and sixty equal parts, which are call'd Degrees,
Grades, Steps, but none of them are number'd quite round, save only the
Aequinoctial, which noteth the divisions of Longitude, but all the rest are
first divided into four equal parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the reason why the Circles are divid∣ed in 360.</NOTE> which are call'd Quadrants, and each
Quadrant into ninety; what the reason was at first of pitching upon this
number of three hundred and sixty, I know not, there being no Reason in
Nature for this more than for some other Divisions, tho' the Astrologers
make much thereof, and build much thereupon; but the most likely seems
to have been this, that the Radius being equal to the Subtense of a sixth
part of the Circle, did very naturally prompt them to that Primary and na∣tural
Division of it into six equal Parts or Sextants; which division also did
both bisect and trisect the whole Circle, and gave them the Halfs and
Trines, or Thirds; then bisection being the easiest of all other Sections, the
bisecting the Bisection gave them the Quadrisection, Quadrants, or Quar∣tiles
of the whole; from these Quadrants setting off the Sextants either
way, gave them the Duodecimals or Twelfs of the Circle, or the Thirds of
the Quadrants or Quartiles. These Duodecimals in the Ecliptick, of which
I shall hereafter speak, are call'd Signs, which signifies Marks, Divisions, or
Sections of the Ecliptick. Thus far the cause or their Divisions, seem'd
reasonable enough, more especially for the New Moons being twelve in the
Year; as did also their next of subdividing each of these into halves,
making four and twenties or Hours, into which number they divided the
Natural Day, or one whole Revolution of the Earth. But the <HI>Chinese</HI> and
<HI>Tartars</HI> contented themselves with the Duodecimal, dividing the whole Re∣volution
only into twelve Cha. which we must call Bi-hours; tho' on the
contrary, they divided their Zodiack into twenty four parts, which we must
call half Signs, being produc'd only by Bisection upon the first Sextants; but
why the Eastern and Western <HI>Literati</HI> differ'd afterwards, is not easy to guess.</P>
<P>And whether the Western <HI>Literati</HI> did divide these twenty fourths into
fifteenths,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Difference be∣tween the Eastern and Western Lite∣rati.</NOTE> that they might introduce into the Circle both Trisection and
Quisection, which are both necessary to this subdivision, I dare not deter∣mine.
That which seems to have been the most likely occasion, I conceive
to have been the nearness of this number of three hundred and sixty to the
natural Division of the Zodiack, by the annual motion of the Sun, which e∣very
Day doth almost measure such a space, compleating its Circuit in three
hundred sixty five Days and a quarter almost, as the Revolutions of the
Moon in a Year might prompt them to make use or the Duodecimal Section
for the Zodiack. But whatever were the Occasions or Reasons that prompt'd
them to these Divisions, certain it is that now all do agree to make use
thereof, and call this twelfth part a Sign, and the three hundred and sixtieth
part a Degree; and thence each Sign containeth thirty Degrees, each of
these Degrees they again subdivide into sixty equal parts, which little parts
they call Minutes or Primes, each of these Primes subdivided by sixty, give
Seconds or Second Minutes; a sixtieth part of a Second is a Third, a sixtieth
of a Third a Fourth, and so onward by Sexagesimal Subdivision, to Fifths,
Sixths, Sevenths, in a continued Geometrical Progression, as far as is needful;
for what Reason they have pitch'd upon this Sexagesimal Progression, I can∣not
imagine, unless it were because they had divided the Sextant (which, as
I told you, was the first and most natural Division of the Circle, its Subtense
being equal to the Radius) into sixty Degrees; but certain it is, that it
is much more incommodious for Calculation than the common Decimal way,
and much more than a Duodecimal, which might be invented; for that the
Sexagesimal must take two places for every Ascent, whereas the Decimal
takes up one place only for one Step or Ascent. So also might a Duodeci∣mal,
if rightly order'd, by making two new single Characters for ten and
eleven, and making the Character of ten serve for twelve or Dozen; then
the next or third place will be Grosses, the fourth Dugrosses, the fifth Gross
Grosses, the sixth Du gross Grosses, and so onward, answerable to Unites,
Tens, Hundreds, Thousands, Ten Thousands, Hundred Thousands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
in the Decimal progression of places. And tho' possibly the Names and
<PB N="489" REF="468"/>
Practise of it may seem at first a little uncouth and strange, yet a little use
will easily overcome that difficulty, and make it manifest to be a much better
Progression than the Decimal, which is now generally used: But this only by
the bye.</P>
<P>I shall next proceed to shew how these Divisions are made use of in those
two sorts of Circles. First, Then, the Aequinoctial, and all the lesser Circles,
begin their Divisions from the Section of them by that half of the Meridian
which is call'd the first Meridian, which passes through the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean,
of which I have already spoken; and the Divisions of them are accounted from
thence Eastwardly, 'till the whole Revolution be compleated and end in this
first Meridian in three hundred and sixty. But the Divisions made upon the
Meridians begin to be number'd or accounted from the Aequinoctial, and end
at each Pole in ninety, which expresses the several Latitudes of those places
that lie under them, or their breadth or distance from the Aequinoctial Line,
either towards the North or South Pole.</P>
<P>Now, the next thing is to consider, how both these Lines and the divisions
of them, proper and peculiar to any one place, may be actually found at that
place, which is the ultimate end and result of all that is sought for in the Art
of Navigation; for these being truly found for any place, they presently
shew Its true Position and Situation in the respect of all other known and de∣termin'd
places upon the Earth.</P>
<P>In order to perform which Inquiry the whole Art of Navigation is con∣triv'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The end of the Art of Navi∣gation.</NOTE>
and all the assistances that can be procur'd, either from Nature
or Art, are fetch'd in and made use of; and all indeed that can be found,
tho' very many and very curious and ingenious, are little enough, and too
few to accomplish the same to that certainty and accurateness that is to be
desir'd, and is necessary to compleat and perfect the same.</P>
<P>The Helps then that are made use of are either afforded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Helps.</NOTE> First, By the
Heavens and the Caelestial Bodies, such as the Sun, Moon, Planets and
Stars.</P>
<P>Or, Secondly, By the Terrestrial, or such things upon and In the Body of
the Earth itself, as afford Indications and Charactersticks proper and sufficient
to direct the Geographer and Hydrographer, for discovering and determin∣ing,
by known measures, how every place is Posited and Situated in respect of
those Lines I have already mentioned; and thence of determining their Posi∣tion
and Magnitude in respect to one another in regard of other imaginary
Lines, which are taken in from Art to assist the Mariner in his Computations
and Accounts; such as are the Rhomb Lines and other great Circles which are
neither Meridians nor Aequator, but such as are necessary to be suppos'd ei∣ther
for computing the way of the Ship, or Course steer'd, or for computing
and resolving Triangles, or for giving the Position and nearest distance be∣tween
place and place, in a great Circle or determin'd Azymuth.</P>
<P>Three things then may be found out by the help of the Caelestial Bodies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three things to be found by the help of Caelesti∣al Bodies.</NOTE></P>
<P>First, The Meridian Line or North and South Line, and consequently all
the other Azymuth Lines or Points of the Horizon on either side of the
Meridian.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Latitude of any place, or the distance of that place from
the Aequinoctial or the midellemost of all Parallels between the two Poles.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The Longitude of any place, or distance of the Meridian of the
place from the Prime Meridian agreed upon.</P>
<P>But before I proceed to shew how these three things are to be found by
the help of Caelestial Bodies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several Max∣ims premis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.</NOTE> I conceive it necessary to premise some few
Maxims which are not obvious to any, but such as have by diligent Obser∣vation
found out and demonstrated the certainty thereof. The grounds and
method of which Inventions would be as little to our present purpose as it
would be tedious here to repeat. I shall rather chuse to acquaint you with
the Result or Conclusion which may be taken for granted, 'till some more cu∣rious
and exact Observers, than have hitherto been, shall find and demonstrate
<PB N="490" REF="469"/>
the contrary, some of which may be done by Land Observations, but not
by such as can be made at Sea.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1"/>The First Maxim then (of which we are sufficiently assur'd for this pur∣pose)
is this, That the distance of the fixt Stars is so very great and im∣mense
in respect of the Magnitude of the Earth, that its whole Body is
but as it were an insensible Point; so that the Figure, Appearance, Posi∣tion
and Distance of all the fixt Stars, to, or from, one another, doth to the
naked Eye, or assisted by the best common Instrument, appear exactly the
same, whether the Eye be plac'd in the very Center of the Earth, or in any
Point of the Superficies, or any other Point of the whole Body. So that
not only the Center of the Earth may be taken to be the Center of the
imaginary Concave Sphaere wherein all the fixt Stars are plac'd, but any o∣ther
Point whatsoever of its whole Extension or Corporeity.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"/>A Second Maxim of the <HI>Aristarcheans</HI> or <HI>Copernicans</HI> is this, That the di∣stance
of the fixt Stars is so incomprehensibly great, that tho' the Earth be sup∣pos'd
to move round the Sun in a Circular or Elliptical Line, whose Diame∣ter
is ten thousand times the Diameter of the Earth, yet that even this whole
Circle, in comparison of the imaginary Orb of the fixt Stars, is but a Point,
and that therefore with the naked Eye and common Instruments no differ∣ence
can be discover'd of the Distances and Positions of the fixt Stars in re∣spect
of one another, tho', as I have elsewhere shewn, there is a way to find a
difference by the help of very long and good Telescopes, fixt at Land, but
no Instruments at Sea can discover it; which is enough for our present pur∣pose.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3"/>A Third Maxim is, That two Points of the Earth do steadily point or
direct towards two Points among the fixt Stars in the Heavens, which Points
are call'd the two Polar Points, the two in the Heavens being Perpendicular
over the two on the Earth; and the Diameter of the Earth passing through
these Points, is call'd the Axis of the World, and suppos'd to be continu'd
to the fixt Stars: And tho' this Axis be carry'd round in the Orb of the
Earth in a Parallelism, and so describes an Elliptical Cylinder, whose long∣est
Diameter is the Diameter of the Earth's Orb about the Sun, yet so vast∣ly
are the fixt Stars distant, that this whole Ellipsis, among the fixt Stars,
appears but a Point, and the Axis of the Earth seems to respect one and the
same Point among the fixt Stars quite round the Year.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="4"/>A Fourth Maxim is, That all Perpendicular Lines respect the Center of
the Earth, and that the level of Water, and other Liquors is a plain and
at right Angles with this Perpendicular in every Point of the Surface of the
Earth.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="5"/>Fifthly, That every one of these Perpendiculars, suppos'd continu'd to
the fixt Stars, will, by the diurnal Rotation of the Earth, describe, among
the fixt Stars, a Circular Line; which Circular Line, answering to the Per∣pendicular
or Zenith of any place, will appear the same round the Year, to
any Instrument that can be us'd at Sea.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="6"/>Sixthly, That the level of the Water, or any other Liquor suppos'd con∣tinu'd
to the fixt Stars, will actually divide the whole Sphaere thereof into
two equal parts, tho' it be out of the Center of the Earth, and upon its
Surface; and tho' the Body of the Earth itself be suppos'd to be as far di∣stant
from the Center of that Orb, as it is distant from the Center of the
Sun.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="7"/>Seventhly, That the visible Angle of any Caelestial Body, with this Per∣pendicular
or Zenith Line of any place, or with the plain of the level of
the Water or Horizon, will be the same (as to any thing that can be disco∣ver'd
by Instruments at Sea) as if the Center of the Instrument were in the
<PB N="491" REF="470"/>
Center of the Earth, and that Center of the Earth were always in the
Center of the Sun, and that Center of the Sun were the true Center of the
Orb of the fixt Stars; and thence</P>
<P>Eighthly, We are to conclude that all Observations of the fixt Stars,<MILESTONE N="8"/>
wheresoever made upon the Surface of the Earth and Sea, will give the same
appearances, as if the Eye or Center of the Instrument (by which such an
Angle is measur'd) were at all times in the Center of the Orb of the fixt
Stars.</P>
<P>Ninethly, That all Observations to be made of the Positions of the Sun in<MILESTONE N="9"/>
respect of the fixt Stars, will be the same, as if the Eye and Center of the
Instrument were plac'd in the Center of the Earth; and that whether the
Sun be suppos'd to be mov'd about the Earth, or the Earth about the Sun,
the visible appearances of the Place, Line, or Point of the Sun among the
fixt Stars, will be in both cases the same.</P>
<P>I shall not now meddle with the appearances of the other Planetary Bo∣dies,
because at present, for this purpose, I shall not have occasion to make
use of them, but reserve the consideration of their appearances to another
part of this Discourse, wherein I shall more particularly treat concerning
the ways for finding the Longitude of places by Caelestial Helps.</P>
<P>First then, for finding the true Meridian,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ways for find∣ing the Meri∣dian.</NOTE> or North and South Line of
any place, there are very many and very differing ways that have been in∣vented
and Publish'd by several Authors for this purpose, of which some are
much more difficult and complicated, and prae-suppose several things to be
known which require another method than this I am now discoursing of;
which may be very useful for performing other kinds of Problems, but are
not so proper for what I here intend: Others that are more simple and plain,
and yet sufficient to perform this effect; some of these are more proper to be
made use of at Land, others are more easy and practicable, and can be made
use of at Sea as well as on the Land.</P>
<P>These ways are either, First, By help of the Sun in the Day-time, or by
the help of the fixt Stars in the Night.</P>
<P>Those,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By the sun two ways.</NOTE> by the help of the Sun, are twofold; First, By the help of an Azy∣muth
Compass to observe the true Azymuth or Amplitude of the Body of
the Sun in its Rising in the Morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st. Way.</NOTE> and Setting at Night of the same Day
in the Winter half Year, or the said Amplitude of the Sun in Setting at
Night, and rising the next Morning in the Summer half Year; for by divid∣ing
the Angle, made by those two Azymuths, into two equal parts, the Me∣ridian
Line for the place where it is inquir'd and observ'd is given, the Me∣ridian
Line this way found, is that which is most commonly us'd, and will be
near enough the truth for any common use, as for finding the variation of the
Compass for the place where it is made, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But yet, it is not exactly true,
nor can it in some more curious Inquiries, be made use of, and that, First,
By reason that all the times of the Year, unless it be on the very solftitial
or longest and shortest Days, and even then also unless the Solstice be ex∣actly
at Noon, the Sun is either increasing or decreasing its Declination; and
so the Sun is really in a differing parallel in the Morning from what it was at
Night of the same Night, and in an other parallel at Night than what it was
in the Morning of the same Day, and consequently the Rising and Setting
Azymuths or Amplitudes do not make equal Angles with the true Meridian
Line; but the nearer the Sun is to either of the Solstitical Points, the less
the Error, and the nearer the Aequinoctial, the greater.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Meridian this way found is not exact, by reason of the
differing Refraction of the Air in the Morning from what it is in the Even∣ing,
which I my self have very often observ'd here at <HI>London,</HI> and may be
much more considerable in more Southern Countries, where the difference
between the warmth of the Air at Sun Rising and Sun Setting is much more
considerable than in this more temperate Climate, tho' on the other side that
<PB N="492" REF="471"/>
greater difference of Refraction may, I confess, make a much less difference
of Azymuth or Amplitude where, the Sun's Rising and Setting is nearer to a
Perpendicularity to the Horizon. However, some uncertainty is thereby
caus'd, and in no case, but what I before mention'd, is exact: However,
this is better than the way that is most made use of at Sea, for finding the va∣riation
of the Magnetical Needle or Compass, tho' yet it be far enough
from the accurateness desirable: for the way by them generally practis'd is
not by comparing the Morning and Evening Amplitude together, but either
the Morning or the Evening alone esteeming the apparent Amplitude to be that
which by Instruments or Calculation for that Day and Latitude they are in,
the true Amplitude ought to be, allowing nothing at all for Refraction; in
which case the visible Amplitude, by Refraction, makes more difference from
what it truly ought to be, than two Amplitudes compar'd together, tho' suf∣fering
differing Refractions, will produce.</P>
<P>A Second way of finding the Meridian of any place by the Sun, is this,
First, By the help of an Azymuth Compass to observe the Azymuth of the
Sun about three Hours before Noon, at the same moment another Person
with some convenient Instrument observing the true Altitude of it above the
Horizon, then staying 'till about three Hours after Noon, and watching di∣ligently
when the Sun is descended to the same Altitude or height it was ob∣serv'd
at in the Morning, and noting the true Azymuth thereof, and pro∣ceeding
to divide the Angle between the two Azymuths, this way found by
the Azymuth Compass, into two equal parts; this doth give the Meridian
Line, and at the same time the variation of the Compass. This is abundant∣ly
more exact than the former way; for, First, The Sun is to be taken when
at a considerable height above the Horizon, and so by that means is free for
the most part from Refraction, whereas the Refraction in the Horizon is some∣times
exceeding great. Secondly, The times between the two Observations
being but short, as four, five or six Hours at most; the difference that is
caus'd by the Sun's altering its Declination, is not so sensible; as in a longer
time; and therefore this of the two is much to be prefer'd, and is sometimes
made use of at Sea also.</P>
<P>Now these Azymuths may be easily enough observ'd upon the Land, where a
Horizontal Floor may be procur'd convenient for this purpose? but at Sea,
where the Ship is roul'd and turn'd by the unsteady Surface of the Waves, it
seems more difficult. But even there also Art has not left the Mariner with∣out
a convenience of a Horizontal Plain, which may be call'd fix'd, and that
is the Compass Needle or Chard conveniently suspended in a Box; for by its
suspension it maintains its Level, and by the Magnetical Vertue of the mid∣dle
it keeps its Position in respect of the Points of the Horizon, notwith∣standing
all the unsteadiness of the Vessel in which it is carry'd: But of this
and other Instruments, I shall hereafter discourse more at large.</P>
<P>There is another Way of finding the Azymuth by the Sun or Stars at all
times, either of the Day or Night, and that is by the help of exact Clocks,
either with a Pendulum, or some other exact way of equally and exactly
measuring and dividing of Time; and this method will be the most easy, the
most exact, and most practicable at Sea, such a Clock at all times giving the
true time of the Day or Night, if it be set with care at the Rising and Set∣ting
of the Sun, and then either by some one of the Projections (for it may
be done by all the three usual Projections with case) or by the Doctrine of
Triangles: the Azymuth of the Sun or Star, for that time, is given, the Lati∣tude
being suppos'd known; but the Meridian is given, tho' the Latitude be
not suppos'd known, and without either Projection or Trigonometrical Cal∣culation,
if the times of Rising and Setting be noted; for if by the said
Clock the exact time when the Sun is risen just above the Horizon in the
Morning, so that the under Limb of it juse touch the Horizon, be taken no∣tice
of and set down; and the time when the under Limb of the Sun just
touches the Horizon in the Evening be constantly observ'd, it will be easy
to know what Hour and Minute by the said Clock, will denote either the
<PB N="493" REF="472"/>
Hour of Twelve at Noon, or the Hour of Twelve at Night; that is, when
the Sun shall be in the Meridian of the place; for by halfing the time inter∣jacent
between the Rising and Setting, or between the Setting and Rising,
you have the time of the Sun's being in the Meridian to be shewn by the said
Clock; and, if it be desir'd, the Clock may, by this way, be daily adjusted to the
Meridian of the place. As suppose by the Clock (not yet adjusted to the
Meridian of the place, but yet going equally and adjusted to the length of
the Day) in be observ'd, that the Sun in Setting just touches the Horizon at
1h. 26'. by the Hand of the Clock, and that the next Morning, when the Sun
in Rising be just got clear above the Horizon, the Hand of the Clock points
at 11. 48'. it will be easy to find what Hour, by the Hand of the said Clock
so continuing moving without altering or setting the Hand, shall denote the
Hour of Twelve for the following Day; for halfing the time between 1h. 26'.
and 11h. 48'. which is 10h. 22'. you have 6h. 37'. for the Hour of Noon the
following Day; for half the difference between 1h. 26'. and 11. 48'. being 5h. 11'. this being added to 1h. 26'. the Hour of Setting will shew the time of
Midnight to be by the Clock 6h. 37'. and consequently the Hour will be the
same when the Sun will be in the Meridian the next Day. Against this way
it may be Objected,</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Objection against this way obviated.</NOTE> That tho' the Clock be adjusted to the middle motion of the Sun,
yet that That will not be true for the length of any Day in the Year with∣out
regard to the reaper Aequation of Time for the Day of Observation.
This I grant is so; but as the difference between the length of any one
Day and any other is not very great, so will this difference be yet much less
considerable, if it be made use of for to shew them, when is the time to observe
the height of the Sun in the Meridian; and not much more considerable, if
the knowing the time when the Sun is in the Meridian, the Line of North
and South be to be found, or the variation of the Needle; but yet if it he
thought necessary or considerable, it is easily provided against by a Table of
Aequation of Time.</P>
<P>But then there may be a Second Objection made against<NOTE PLACE="marg">A second Ob∣jection obviat∣ed.</NOTE> this way, and
that is, that a Ship being suppos'd under Sail doth continually alter either
its Latitude, or its Longitude, or both; and so, tho' the Clock so observ'd
and adjusted, would at Land, or when the Ship lies at Anchor, serve to
find the time when the Sun is in the Meridian, yet, by reason of this mo∣tion
and progression of the Ship, the direction this way obtain'd cannot be
just. This I grant is also a real cause of variety, and much greater than the
former; yet 'tis not so great, but that it may be provided against, allow∣ance
being made for the same according as the case shall require; for by the
Course Steer'd in the mean time, and the progress in that Course being ta∣ken
notice of by the common way of keeping the Course, and distance Sail'd
by the Logline and Compass, it will be easy to know, near enough for this
purpose, what allowances are to be made, both in regard of the alterations
of one and the other; and so the time of Noon (when the Sun is in the Me∣ridian)
may be accurately enough (for all uses at Sea) known and observ'd.
And as this may serve to find the time, when the Sun is in the Meridian, in
the Day, so may it serve to find the time when any notable Star, whose right
Ascension is known, comes to the Meridian at Night; and so consequently
(the declination of the Star being also known) of finding the Latitude of the
place, by taking the Altitude of the said Star, when thus known, to be in
the Meridian.—Which is the second way of finding the Meridian by the
help of Caelestial Bodies in the Night.</P>
<P>Now as the Meridian may be found by Stars, with the help of such a Clock,
so may it be found out by the Amplitudes of their Rising and Setting, or
their Azymuths observ'd with an Azymuth Compass, when they are found
to be of the same Altitude, before they come to, and after they have pass'd
the Meridian; the same methods being us'd, as I have already shewn, are
necessary to be observ'd in finding the Meridian by the Sun.</P>
<P><PB N="494" REF="473"/>
A Fourth way of finding the Meridian Line by the help of Caelestial Bo∣dies
is by such of the fixt Stars near either of the Poles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A fourth way of finding the Meridian by the Stars near the Pole.</NOTE> as in the place where
the Observation is to be made, do neither Rise nor Set, but continually ap∣pear
above the Horizon; this is done by noting their greatest Eastern and
Western Digressions, by the help of an Azymuth Compass; for by compar∣ing
those two together, and halving the difference, the Meridian Line is
easily known, and at the same time the variation of the Needle for the place,
where such Observations shall be made. Now the Times and Positions of
these Stars, when in their greatest Eastern and Western Digression, may be
easily found, if the Day of the Year be known, and the right Ascensions and
Declinations, of those Stars be also known, and a Mapp be at hand to shew
the Situation of those Stars in respect of one another, and in respect of the
Polar Point, about which they seem to move; which is in part done in the
Instrument call'd the Nocturnal. In making these Observations also, such a
Clock, as I but now mention'd, will be of very good use to find the time pre∣cisely,
when they are in their greatest Elongation from the Meridian.</P>
<P>These are (among multitudes of ways that have been proposed by Astrono∣mers,
Geographers, and Natural Writers) the most easy, plain, and obvious
ways to be understood and practis'd by any one, not otherwise skill'd in A∣stronomy,
nay, most of them even without knowing the Latitude of the place
where the Observation is made, or the declination of the Sun, or place of
the Planets or fixt Stars; which I have chosen the rather, because to me they
seem more simple and praevious to them all; and therefore I chose first to
discourse and explain them, after the ways of finding the Meridian, and con∣sequently
the variation of the Compass.</P>
<P>The next thing that is to be obtain'd by Observations of Caelestial Bodies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of finding the Latitude.</NOTE>
is the Latitude of the place, or the distance of that place either Northwards
or Southwards from the Aequinoctial Line. This is found various ways, both
in the Day by the Sun, and in the Night by the Stars; and that with much ease
after the true Meridian by the former method, and consequently the varia∣tion
of the Compass for the place of inquiry, are first known; for by means
of the Compass, so examin'd, the true Meridian Line is continually pointed
out upon the Sea; and so it will easily appear when the Sun or Stars are in
that Azymuth. The same thing is also found by the aforesaid Clock; then
the declination of the Sun, or the true place of the Sun, for that time, being
known for the Day, and the declination of the Star, to be observ'd, being
known for the Night Observation, both which are express'd in Tables cal∣culated
for that purpose, by observing the Altitude of either, when in the
Meridian, above the Horizon, and making allowance for the declination of
the Body so observ'd, either by Addition or Subduction, as the Case requires,
you find the height of the Aequinoctial Circle, which is the same with the di∣stance
of the Pole from the Zenith, the Complement of which is the Altitude
of the Polar Point of the Heaven, or the distance of the Zenith of the place
from the Aequinoctial Circle in the Heaven, or the Latitude of the place
from the Line or Aequinoctial, suppos'd to be drawn upon the Earth.</P>

THe Author having, in the foregoing Descourses treated of the Refraction or
Inflection of the Air, as likewise concerning the drawing a true Meridian
Line, and taking the Latitude of the place exactly at Land, I thought best to insert
here the Abstracts of some Astronomical Lectures of that Subject, and give the de∣scriptions
of some Instruments contrived by him for the nice taking and dividing of
Minute Angles, and some other useful Astronomical Instruments and Contrivances;
especially, since I do not find them any where Published in any of his Works. When these
Lectures were read, I know not, there being no date to them; but I judge by the
Hand, and some other Circumstances, that they were read some Years before those of
Navigation in 1683, and the following Years; however, the time not being, as to
this, material, I hope the Reader will not be displeased with them: They treat of the

<P>THe Persection of Astronomy (a Science that has been cultivated in all
Ages, but more highly improv'd in these last Centuries) depends very
much upon the knowledge of the distance of those Caelestial Bodies, whose
ways we would know, and whose motions, and velocities we would calculate.
Of which how certain we hitherto are, we need go no farther to be satisfy'd
than to examine a few of the most famous Astronomers in their Opinions a∣bout
the Distance or Parallax of the Sun. We find the noble <HI>Ticho</HI> to make
the middle distance of the Sun 1150 Semidiameters. The ingenious <HI>Kepler</HI>
in the <HI>Rudolphine Tables</HI> almost thrice as much,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the differ∣ence between Astronomers as to the Suns di∣stance.</NOTE> namely, 3381. The learned
<HI>Bullialdus</HI> 1460; but <HI>Vendelius</HI> ten times more than he, and near fourteen
times as much as <HI>Ticho, viz.</HI> 14656. with the half of which <HI>Riccioli</HI> is con∣tent
making it only 7580. And these being deductions from their own se∣veral
Parallaxes, and perhaps not any one of them from the true Parallax of
the Sun, we shall not wonder to see them there also disagree as much <HI>Ticho</HI>
making the Parallax of the Sun in its middle distance to be full 3.' 0.'' <HI>Kepler</HI>
only 1'. 0''. but <HI>Bulliald</HI> 2'. 21''. <HI>Vendeline</HI> 14''. and <HI>Riccioli</HI> 28''. And as <HI>Here∣cules
ex pede,</HI> we may hence guess what is likely to be the Hypotheses of all
the other Planets. Nor indeed shall we wonder if we consider, First, The
accurateness requir'd both in their Calculations and Observations, and next
the uncertainty of the Horizontal Refraction; and 'till this last be brought
to a very great degree of accurateness and certainty, it is not to be expected
that we shall every certainly know the true distance of the Planets by the most
accurate Calculations and Observations imaginable;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cause these of from the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> for not to stay now on
the consideration of what I shall by and by more largely manifest, <HI>viz.</HI> the
small and suddain mutations of the internal parts of the Air from Heat and
Cold, and Winds and Rains, and the like; we may from the differing Gra∣vitation
of the Atmosphere, which has been observ'd from the rising and fal∣ling
of the Quicksilver in the Torricellian Experiments to be very considerable,
namely, almost a fourteenth greater at some times than at others; we may,
I say, from hence collect how uncertain the Refractions, must be, which are
caus'd by so unstable and uncertain a Medium. If therefore we that are
thus plac'd this in Atmosphere, have yet a mind to know as much as could
be known of those great Works of the Creator that seem to whirle about us and
incompass us, we should, for that end, first consider well, and indeavour to ac∣quaint
our selves with the Nature of the Air or Medium through which we
look, that lying the first Obstacle in our way towards those Bodies, we would
contemplate. And therefore the examination of the Nature of this trans∣parent
Medium which thus incompasses us, and through which we are fain
to see all the Caelestial Bodies as through a Glass Window, will deserve and
require our indeavours in the first place; for being ignorant of the Nature of
this ambient pellucid Body, it will be very difficult to determine any thing
positively and exactly about the distance and true place of the Planets. And
to this end I do not at all like their way of examining it, who first choose an
<PB N="496" REF="475"/>
Hypothesis of the Planets distance, and from that collect the height of the
Air and the Refraction of it, and by that means reconcile what Parallax they
please to the Planet they observe. Nor yet their way who fancying an ima∣ginary
Surface of the Air, at I know not what height, and there giving it an
arbitrary refractive Quality, still make the Refraction of the Air as would re∣concile
all their Theories and Observations. Nor theirs who, from the Ec∣clipse
of the Moon and shadow of the Earth, collect great matters; for (as I
shall anon shew) all those Phaenomena may be explicated, tho' the Diameter
of the Sun be no bigger, nay, tho' much less than that of the Earth, by
means of the Refraction in the Atmosphere, we being hitherto uncertain how
great it may be, and 'till we are assur'd of it nothing can be concluded as to
the distance of the Sun or Moon from the Ecclipses. But I rather therefore
suppose it necessary for him that will know the true Nature of the Air as to
Refraction, and the true Parallax or Distance of the Caelestial Bodies, to go
quite other ways to work to find each of them a part. And for the exami∣nation
of the Air it will be requisite to collect and examine as many Phaeno∣mena
of that kind as can be met with all. Such as these I shall now acquaint
you with. It has been often observ'd, by the naked Eye, that the Sun and
Moon, when near the Horizon, appear oval; but since the Invention—</P>
<P>The remainder of this Lecture is lost.</P>
<P>I did the last Term indeavour to shew, from very many Experiments and
Observations, that the Air or Atmosphere, wherewith we are incompass'd,
had in it two Proprieties not taken notice of before, which, 'till they were
well understood, examin'd and regulated, would so far spoil all the most ac∣curate
Horizontal Observations that were not somewhat regulated according
to them, that there could be no certain deductions from them of the Distance
or Parallax of any Caelestial Body; no, not of the Moon itself, which is
nearest to us, and consequently has the most sensible Parallax: For I then
shew'd, that notwithstanding all the Affirmations, and Theories, and Cal∣culations,
and Observations of the best and most accurate Astronomers, it
was possible to solve all the Phaenomena, tho' the Moon, for instance, were
suppos'd not above a third part of the distance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Inflecti∣on of the At∣mosphere.</NOTE> she is commonly by them sup∣pos'd
to be: For the Inflection of the Rays of Light, which is made in the
several Regions and Spaces of the Air from the differing degrees of Expansion
and Condensation of the parts of the Air in those places, does so uncertain∣ly
bend those Rays before they come to the Eye, that 'tis hardly possible by
the most accurate and diligent Observations that can be made in any one
place, to regulate one already rais'd Hypothesis, or to found and establish a
new one; and therefore I shew'd, that certainly the best way to redress this
inconvenience, will be to get certain Observatioas made of the way of the
Moon among the small or Telescopical fixt Stars,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two observers at a distance to observe the Moon's place among the fixt Stars.</NOTE> by two Persons very far
remov'd from each other in Latitude, tho' as exactly as could be seated under
one and the same Meridian as to Longitude; each of which two Persons should
observe exactly with an excellent Telescope fitted with a divided Ruler, the way
of the Moon among the small fixt Stars; and thereby we should (by first regu∣lating
the distance and knowing certainly her apparent Diameter at that
time when she was at that distance) be able at all times by a single Observati∣on
of her Diameter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How to know the Moon's true distance; and thence the In∣flection of the Rays.</NOTE> with a good Telescope, without any further Calculation,
certainly to observe and know her true distance at that time, and then it
would be easy very to know also what must be her Parallax in all Altitudes a∣bove
the Horizon, and consequently it will be extreamly easy by the de∣duction
of the Parallax of the Altitude of the Moon, to know, by the Ob∣servation,
what is the then sensible Inflection of the Rays.</P>
<P>For the performing of which Observations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Requisites for this Observa∣tion.</NOTE> there seem to be very many
things requisite, which I shall indeavour to explain. And the first is a good
Telescope about some ten or twelve Foot long; for this, if it be well fitted
into a small and light Tube, is easily enough managable by any one single
Person without much trouble. This Telescope is best adapted for Caelestial
Observations, if it have only at that end which is next the Eye, one pretty
<PB N="497" REF="476"/>
deep Convex Crystalline Glass well Polish'd and of clear Mettle; for there∣by
the Objects will appear much plainer and distincter, tho' there cannot be
so much seen at a time, as through a Telescope fitted with two, or more
Convex Eye-glasses: Then to fit this Instrument for the Observation of the
Diameters of the ☉ ☽ ♄ ♃ ♂ ♀ or ☿, the most convenient and most easy
way is to take a small piece of Wire, and to place it so within the Tube, at
such a convenient distance from the Eye-glass, that the Eye indeavouring to
look, through the Tube may ice it most distinctly; that is, it must be plac'd
within the Tube just in the focus of that Eye-glass; then having by the Eye
found the true distance of this Ruler to take it out and divide it into Inches,
and Decimal parts of Inches, cutting with the edge of a Knife, or the like,
very small cross Strokes or Gutters, in each of those Divisions, and every
fifth or tenth Notch, to cut much deeper, so to make it more conspicu∣ous.
Having thus divided and mark'd it, this Ruler or Wire should be a∣gain
put into its place, and the Tube directed against some Star in or near
the Aequator, and in that Position so fixt, that the motion of that Star may
be plainly observ'd passing along by the divided Ruler. Then having so a∣dapted
it, there should be provided a Pendulum made with a Thread and
Plummet and adjusted to such a length, as may make it vibrate once every
second Minute of Time; having this ready, the next thing to be done, is
to place the Tube so, as that the Star may appear just coming into the
Glass, then fixing the Tube, and observing 'till the Star be just upon one of
the Divisions, let go the Pendulum, and observe the passage of the Star a∣long
by the Ruler, 'till by the vibration of the Pendulum you find a minute
of Time past, or any other determinate number of Seconds you shall think
fit, observing exactly how many Divisions on the Ruler the Star has past by
in that time; for by this means it will be exceeding easy to observe how ma∣ny
of those Decimal divisions answer to the Subtense of a Minute of a De∣gree;
for since we know that the motion of those Stars which are in, or ve∣ry
near to the Aequinoctial, is near a Minute of Longitude in four Seconds
of Time, or a Degree of Longitude in four Minutes of Time, 'twill be very
easy by observing the motion of the Star along the Ruler, and comparing in
with the Vibrations of a Pendulum, to find what length of the Ruler does
answer to a Minute, or the five Thousand four Hundredth part of Quadrant;
which having found, it will be easy to place several divisions on the other
side of the Ruler, that each Minute may be divided into Seconds.</P>
<P>As in the fifth Figure of the eighth Table;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the Instru∣ment Tab. 8. Fig. 5.</NOTE> suppose ABCD to represent
the bright Area of Light appearing through the Telescope; let BD represent
the Wire or Ruler, which seems, to one that looks through it, to divide that
Area into two equal parts; let the small divisions on the under side be the
Inches and Decimals; and let the divisions on the upper side E F G H I K,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> represent the distances, which, by the Vibrations of the Pendulum, have
been found to answer to a Minute; for having, by the Pendulum, found
the Star to have mov'd from K to E in twenty Seconds of Time, it is mani∣fest,
if that distance be divided into five equal parts, each of these must
answer to a first Minute of a Degree; each of which first Minutes or
Di∣stances EF FG GH HI, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may be again subdivided into a determinate
number of equal parts, each of which will answer to so many second Mi∣nutes
of a Degree; so that by this means not only the Diameters of the
Sun and Moon may be found pretty exactly to Seconds, but the Diameters
also of all the other Planets. The distances also of the small Telescopical
Stars one from another, may, by this means, be very easily observ'd.</P>

which by the opening or shutting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A double Te∣lescope for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ak∣ing Angles, this is after∣wards describ'd</NOTE> or the moving of two six Foot Te∣lescopes
on a Joint in the manner of a Joint-Ruler, and a small diagonal Scale
which measures the Angle they make with each other, when any two Stars, by
two Observators, are at the same instant seen through those two Tubes;
which Instrument I shall, on some other occasion, describe; for it is indeed
one of the best for the observations of the distances and places of the Stars that
has been yet thought on, and may serve also for measuring the Diameters of
the Sun and Moon, tho' nothing near so exactly as the newly mention'd
twelve Foot Telescope; for by the divided Ruler the Diameter of the Pla∣nets
may be distinguish'd even to Seconds. Wherefore, if by means of Ob∣servations
made at very far remov'd Stations, we can be assur'd of the di∣stance
of any of the Planets, and by this means, at the same time, we have
the apparent Diameter of that Body, it will be exceeding easy at any other
time, by observing the apparent Diameter with this Tube, to know the
then true distance of the Planet at that time also; for the sines of the ap∣parent
Angles of the Diameter, and the respective distances will be very near
reciprocal; that is, as the sine of the apparent Angle of the Body in the se∣cond
Observation, to the sine of the apparent Angle in the first, so the di∣stance
of the Body in the first Observation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 8. Fig. 6.</NOTE> to the distance of the Body of
second very near. As in the eighth Table, Fig. 6. Let A represent the
Eye on the Earth, BC the Semidiameter of the Moon; for instance, in its
<PB N="499" REF="478"/>
Perigeum; AB the true distance of the Moon at that time from the Eye, BAC
the apparent Angle of the Moon's Semidiameter; let DE represent the
apparent Semidimameter of the Moon in its Apogeum; EAD the Angle
under which it appears. Then on A, and the distance AC describe the Circle
CFG, and from F draw FG Perpendicular to AD; I say, as FG the fine of
the apparent Diameter in the second Observation to BC the fine of the ap∣parent
Diameter in the first; so is AC to AE; that is, so is the Radius of
the lesser Circle of distance to the Radius of the greater, that is, very near
as the lesser distance of the Center of the Planet is to the greater distance of
the Center of the Planet: For DE is very near equal to CB by the supposi∣tion,
as being the visible Diameter of the same Body; tho' why 'tis otherwise
I shall by and by shew; and AC is equal to AF, as being the Rays of the
same Circle; therefore by the second of the sixth Book of <HI>Euclid,</HI> as FG to
ED, that is, to CB; so is AF, that is AC to AE; which AC and AE give
the distance of the Center of the Planet from the Eye much more exactly than
the Lines AB or AD; tho' neither of them are exact but both somewhat less
than the truth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 8. Fig. 7</NOTE> To demonstrate which let DEF in the seventh Figure repre∣sent
the Body of the Sun, Moon, or other Planet, A the Eye, B the Cen∣ter
of that Body, AB the true distance of that Center from the Eye, DAB
half the apparent Angle of the Body, AD a tangent Ray that touches the Globe
DEF in D; from D let fall the Perpendicular DC on AB. I say then, that
the Line AD shall be much nearer an equality to AB than AC; for by the
eighteenth of the third of <HI>Euclid,</HI> ADB shall be a right Angle, and the
Angle ACD is a right Angle by the Construction, and the Angle DAC is
common to both Triangles; therefore as AC to AD, so AD to AB: AD
therefore will be a mean proportional between AC and AB, and consequent∣ly
will be nearer to an equality with AB than AC will be. Nor is the visible
Diameter of a Globe exactly the same at a nearer and farther distance, as
I even now hinted: Nor indeed is it at any time exactly the true, but tho'
the appearing Diameter be really always less than the true Diameter, yet, does
it always subtend a bigger Angle at the Eye.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 9. Fig. 2.</NOTE> To demonstrate which, let us
suppose DEH to signify a great Circle drawn en the Body of the Moon, or
other Globular Body, A the Eye, DC the Semidiameter of the visible part,
BG the true Semidiameter or the Body. I say therefore first, that DC is
really less, tho' it appear bigger to the Eye than BG; for drawing the Line
BD in the Triangle BCD, the Angle C is a right Angle, and consequently BD
is bigger than DC, therefore DC is less than BG which is equal to BD. But Se∣condly,
I say, that DC subtends a greater Angle at the Eye than BG; for AD
being by the supposition a tangent to the Circle at D, a Line, as AG drawn from
any other point of the Semicircle HGE to the point A, must necessarily di∣vide
the Angle DAC into two parts, DAG and. GAC; therefore GAC be∣ing
but a part is less than the whole DAC. Further, I say, of the apparent
Diameters at several Distances, that the shorter distance has always really the
shorter apparent Diameter, but that that shorter Diameter does substend a big∣ger
Angle at the Eye. That the shorter distance has really the shorter visible
Diameter, is evident, because the Bodies are Globular. To demonstrate
which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Fig. 3.</NOTE> suppose ADFG, in the third Figure, to be a plain passing through the
Eye and the Center of the Sun. Let A be the Eye farther remov'd, and B
the Eye nearer plac'd to C the Center of the Sun. DEFH therefore be∣ing
the intersection of this Plain, and the Superficies of the Sun or Planet
will represent a greater Circle on that Body. From the Points A and B
draw the Lines AE and AH and BDBJ; which may touch the Circle in EH,
D and I, and from these two points draw the Lines EH and DI. I say there∣fore
first, that the Diameter EH. of the Disk, of the Sun apparent to the Eye
A, is bigger than DJ the Diameter of the Disk, apparent to the Eye B; for
drawing the Lines EC and DC, HC and IC, 'tis evident DCJ is less than
ECH, and consequently by the fifteenth of the third of <HI>Euclids Elem.</HI> that
DI is less than EH. Next, I say, that the apparent Diameter DJ subtends
a bigger Angle at B than EH does; for BD and BI being tangents to the
Circle DGI, whatsoever Lines are drawn from the point B to any point
of the Circle, must necessarily be drawn between BD and BJ, and conse∣quently
<PB N="500" REF="479"/>
any two of them must make a lesser Angle than DBJ. But to omit
these Niceties, which indeed are so inconsiderable in the observation of the
Distance or Diameter of the Sun or Moon, and much more of the other
smaller Planets, that with the most accurate Instruments that the Art of
Man hath hitherto invented, they will hardly be discernable, as not amount∣ing
to 1/10000 part of the Diameter of the Sun or Moon, when biggest, as
may be seen by a Table of Natural Sines: It will be therefore suficiently ex∣act
to make the Diameters and Distances Reciprocal. So that if by a good
Telescope order'd, as I have directed, the apparent Diameters be heedfully
observ'd, we may, supposing any one distance known, by means of two Ob∣servators,
easily enough know the distance at any time, and consequently
the present Parallax, and from that the Refraction, or rather Inflection of
the Rays in the Atmosphere: We must therefore rectify our Refractions or
Inflections, caus'd by the interpos'd Air, by our certain fore-knowledge of
the present Parallax.</P>
<P>And this Method, tho' it be somewhat praeposerous to the ways yet
practis'd by the best Astronomers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How to know the Moens Or∣bit exactly.</NOTE> is certainly the most Natural; for having
once the certain Parallax of the Moon, we may very easily, from Observations,
collect exactly in what kind of Line or Orbits he is mov'd about the Earth,
and with what Velocity in what parts of that Orbit, and consequently from
some few Observations, her true motions may be known, which we are hi∣therto
not so sure of; and thence consequently 'twill be no difficult matter
to Compose and Constitute a true and real Theory of the motion of the
Moon, and to calculate Tables accordingly; which, tho' it has been hither∣to
pretended by very many, yet o'tiil some such Course as this be taken for
the regulating of Observations, I fear 'twill not be in hast done. From which
Tables, and a Hoop, or Zone of all the Telescopical Stars as well as visible,
what could be less expected than an easy way for finding of the Longitudes of
places? For 'twould be no more difficulty to know the true Longitude of any
place then by a fix Foot Telescope, which is very easily manageable at Sea to
make an Observation of the appulse of the Moon to some fixt Star in that
Zone, and from those exact Tables to calculate at what time that should be
in the place for whose Meridian they are calculated, and at the same time to
what a Clock 'twere in that place where the Observation Is made.</P>
<P>Having, by this means,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To get a true Theory of the sun and the Eccliptick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> got the true Theory of the A Moon, it will be so
much the easier to find out the true Theory of the Sun; for by that of the
Moon we shall be able to know the Inflection of the Rays in the Air, and
consequently the Parallax of the Sun, if sensible, will be quickly found, and
having its apparent Diameter measur'd with a good Telescope at that time
when the Parallax was calculated, it will be very easy from the apparent Dia∣meter
of the same at any other time, thro' the same or any other Telescope
fitted accordingly, to know the true Parallax of the Sun at the time of the
Observation; and consequently both the Obliquity of the Eccliptick will be
exactly known, and the place or Velocity of the Sun in that Eccliptick (or of
the Earth in its Orbit which is all one) will be more easily found, which be∣cause
the ways hitherto us'd of observing only the Meridian Altitudes, are
not so accurate as might be desir'd, I shall propound a way which I think will
be very easily practicable, and will afford most certain information of the ap∣parent
place of the Sun as to its Positions among the fix'd Stars at all times;
and consequently a Year or two's Observations, made after this manner, will
very exactly instruct one how to make exact Tables of the Velocity of the
Sun or Earth in the Eccliptick, and consequently to be the better enabl'd to
raise a true Theory of the motion of the Sun or Earth; and so to be able
more exactly to calculate the Ecclipses of both the Luminaries, and to foretel
all the visible Phaenomena of the Positions of those two Bodies one to another.</P>
<P>The way I propounded is this, First, To get in a convenient place for Ob∣servation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ways to find the Meridian.</NOTE>
an exactly true Meridian Line drawn. This may be done very
many ways, some more easy, others more exact: The most easy and plain
way, and which is pretty exact also, if the Sun be near either of the Tro∣picks,
is by procuring a large smooth Plain, which must be exactly level'd
Horizontally and fixt in that Position; then finding the middle part and tak∣ing
<PB N="501" REF="480"/>
there a Point, describe about that Point, at several distances, several Cir∣cles
one less than another; then erecting a Perpendicular stile in the Center,
and observing a Morning and Afternoon shadow of the Sun, where the sha∣dow
of the top touches the same Circle in two distant places, and dividing
the interpos'd Arch between those two parts into two equal parts, a Line
drawn through that middle Point so found, and the Center of the Plain will
give the true Meridian or North and South Line of the place.</P>
<P>And this supposing the Sun near the Tropick of <HI>Cancer</HI> or <HI>Capricorn</HI> will be
pretty near the true Meridian. But in this Observation care should be had,
that the Sun be pretty much elevated above the Horizon, before the sha∣dow
he observ'd, because of the varying Refractions at several times of
the same Day. The Meridian likewise may be found when the Sun is in ei∣ther
of the Aequinoxes, by observing any two shadows of the Stile, and
drawing a Line through them, and then to that Line from the Center,
drawing another Line at right Angles; for this Perpendicular Line shall be
in or very near the Meridian of the place.</P>
<P>A third way, but not so certain as either, may be, by a pretty large Mag∣netical
Needle, suffer'd to play or move upon a very sharp Point; for in
many places, as at the present, here in <HI>London,</HI> the Needle will, by the Mag∣netism
of the Earth, be directed very near the North and South Line of the
place. But none of all these being exact, the two first being uncertain, by
reason of the annual motion of the Sun or Earth; and this last by reason of
the variation of the Magnetical direction of the Needle, 't will be requisite
to make use of some other that is more accurate.</P>
<P>And among these may be reckon'd the way by taking the Altitude and A∣zymuth
of any known Star, which will require the calculation of a Triangle
or two; or to observe the Azymuth of any Star when it is in the same
Eastern and Western height; or, which is best of all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The most exact way.</NOTE> to observe Azymuths
of the most Eastern and Western excursions of a Star within or near the Ar∣tick
Circle, which, how it may best be done, I shall shew in my next Dis∣course,
as likewise describe some useful Instruments for Astronomical Ob∣servations.</P>
<P>I did, the last Day, propound three things that were requisite for the
Perfection of Astronomical Theories by Observations; and they are such as▪
without which, we shall have but little certainty of any Hypothesis whatso∣ever.
And indeed they were such as should never be seperate; for either of
them being wanting, the other would be imperfect: And therefore when∣soever
any Observation is made of the one without taking notice of the o∣ther,
that Observation must need be imperfect and insignificant. The things
to be observ'd, I shew'd, were three; the first was the true distance of the
Body, whose way and motion was to be observ'd from the Center of the
Earth; the only accurate way of doing which, I shew'd, was by means of
two Observators very far remov'd from each other on the Surface of the
Earth. I shew'd also, that the most convenient places, for such stations,
would be some two places as far remov'd from each other in point of Lati∣tude,
as could be conveniently found, and as near under the same Meridian
or Degree of Longitude. That their belt method of Observation would be to
begin with the Moon, and to find her true distance; and next with the Sun,
observing at the same time their apparent Diameters; for by that means I
shew'd how the apparent Diameter of any one known distance being given,
the true distance, at any other times, would be easily found from the ap∣parent
Diameters, and that therefore there needed no more trouble but
only to observe the apparent Diameters by means of a good Telescope;
and the true distance might, by Calculation, be presently known; for I then
shew'd, that the apparent Magnitude of the Diameter, and the distances
were Reciprocal. I shew'd likewise by what means a Telescope might be so
prepar'd as to be fit for such Observations.</P>
<P>And therefore it were extreamly desirable, that some, whose leisure would
permit them, would set upon this Work, and if they were not able to go
through with the whole, to indeavour to do as much as were requisite for
<PB N="502" REF="481"/>
the Observations to be afterwards made, of the ways and motions of the
Planets.</P>
<P>And for this end,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fixt Stars in the Zodiack to be observ'd.</NOTE> if they did only regulate exactly all the places of the Stars
within, or pretty near the Zodiack, that were either of the first, second,
or third Magnitude; it would be sufficient for any Observations that were
to be made of the Planets, especially if the Observator were furnish'd with
an Instrument which I the last Day mention'd, and promis'd then more ful∣ly
to describe; and that is with a double Telescope, as I may so call it, or
an Instrument, which, by means only of two Telescopes, mov'd on a Joint,
and a Ruler divided by a Line of Chords answerable to the length of the
Telescopes, does, by the help of two Observators, easily and most exactly
determine the Angle of distance of any two Objects. This Instrument was
invented by Sir <HI>Christ. Wren,</HI> a Person so eminent in all kind of Knowledge,
and most especially in Mathematical and Mechanical, that the naming him
the Author will be a sufficient commendation of the Instrument itself. O∣mitting
therefore any further Praises of it, I shall indeavour, in as few
words as may be to describe the Instrument itself, and the several parts of
it, the manner of rectifying it and using it for any Caelestial Observations.</P>
<P>The Instrument consists of two square Tubes or Boxes AB,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Description of the double Te∣lescope. Tab.</HI> 11. <HI>Fig.</HI> 1.</NOTE> and CD, which
are each of them at B and D furnish'd with a good Object-glass of six Foot,
and at the other ends A and C are likewise furnish'd with a very deep Lens
or Eye-glass MN; each of them also have a small Cell to keep the Eye at a
due distance from the Glass; and at a convenient distance within those Eye-glasses,
as about O and P, are plac'd two small Plates of Brass, out of which
a round hole is cut in the manner of the Figure R, only leaving a small Tri∣angle,
whose Point just comes to the Center or middle of this Circle at S;
this I call the Sight, the use of which I shall by and by describe. These two
Tubes, thus fitted, are join'd together by a very firm Joint at E; which
Joint is made so strong and so exact, that the Tubes always, whether open or
shut, keep in the same Plain: These Tubes, being thus join'd, are first recti∣fy'd
to an exact Parallelism one with another, by being directed so against
some Star, and mov'd to and fro 'till the Star be seen through both of them
at the same time to touch the Apex or Corner of the Triangle in the Sight;
at which time, by means of a contrivance at the other end, they are fix'd in
that Parallelism; so that against whatsoever Star one of them be directed,
the other will, in the same manner, be directed also; the conetrivance for
fixing these Tubes at the ends A and C, is this: On the Tube CD is fasten'd
a peice of Brass JK, at the end J, of which, is made a Center or Hole L, at
the same distance from the Tube that the Center E is of at the other end;
and on to the Tube AB is likewise plac'd a corresponding piece of Brass FG,
which is not so fixt to the Tube as the other, but is made to slide a little, as
occasion shall require, between two pieces of Brass T and V, but so as by
means of a small Screw H to be suddainly fix'd in any posture; this piece of
Brass has likewise a small Center or Hole L, at the same distance as near as
may be, that the Center E is remov'd from the Tube AB; these two Centers
are both join'd together by means of a small Screw which passes through both
of them; which being done the Screw H is loosn'd, and the Tubes are, by
being both directed against the same Star, reduc'd to an exact Parallelism;
which being done, by the turning of the Screw H, the Plate FG is firmly fixt
in that posture to the Tube AB, and the Instrument is rectify'd for Observa∣tion.</P>
<P>This being done, the exact distance of the Centers E and L is measur'd,
and by that distance as Radius a Ruler YY is divided, either into a Line of
Chords, or, which is better, into such equal parts whereof ten Thousand
make the whole Radius; then the Screw being remov'd that held the two
Centers together at L, and two small Sockets <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> screw'd on, through which
this divided Ruler may slide, the one on the Center of the Plate FG, the o∣ther
on that of IK. And the one end of the Ruler being fix'd in one of these
Sockets, so as the beginning of the divisions lies just over the Center of it;
and the other part sliding in the other Socket, according as the Tubes are
more or less open'd from each other on the Center E; the two Observators
<PB N="503" REF="482"/>
are to direct each of them his own Tube to the Star, which they have a∣greed
upon to observe; so that at the same time one directs his Tube to
one of those Stars, the other directs his to the other Star, and when each
of them has at the same instant rectify'd his Tube to the Star, he observes
so that the Apex or Point of the Triangle in the sight does just touch the
Star, then he that has the Tube through whose Socket the divided Ruler
slides by turning a small Screw YZ, fixes those Tubes in that posture, and by
the number of the equal divisions of the Ruler, which measures the distance
of the two Centers, the apparent Angle or distance of those two Stars, is
most exactly found to Minutes. And indeed, by means of a small additional
contrivance, which I shall elsewhere shew, it may not only be made to di∣stinguish
Angles to Minutes but to Seconds also. Now this Instrument, be∣sides
this great exactness, has many other conveniences which may render it
very considerable; for it may be made very light, and is also exceeding easily
manageable, and by being clos'd together takes up but a little room, and
may be easily transported from place to place, and made use of almost in any
Chamber; and indeed all Particulars consider'd, it is a worthy Product of its
excellent Inventor: By this, not only the places of the fixt Stars may be re∣gulated,
but even the places of the Planets may most exactly be found.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> Shall here add the Description of an Instrument for taking Angles at one Prospect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 11. Fig. 2.</NOTE>
as I found it describ'd upon a loose Paper. ee, ff, two long Rulers or Arms open∣ing

<P>If therefore by the Instrument describ'd Page 502, all the Stars within or
near the Zodiack were regulated and assertain'd, it would then be much
more secnre, taking the true distance of the Planets to be observ'd from
them, and much more easy to find their true place in the Zodiack; and con∣sequently
a much less number of such kind of Observations would suffice to
determine their true Ways, Motions and Velocities. Now, tho' that emi∣nent
Astronomer <HI>Hevelius</HI> has promis'd shortly to publish to the World a
perfect Catalogue, not only of all the fix'd Stars already taken notice of in
other Catalogues, but even of multitudes of others sufficiently manifest to
the naked Eye, yet we think that Expectation should no ways discourage
any from making Observations himself, since, at belt, no Man can be so sure
of anothers Observations as of his own. And next, since it would not be a
labour of very great difficulty to regulate the places of all the Stars of the first,
second and third Magnitude within or near the Zodiack, because their num∣ber
is not very great.</P>
<P>And, Thirdly, It cannot but be a great satisfaction to any such Obser∣vator
to find when those others, promis'd by <HI>Hevelius,</HI> shall be Publish'd,
that his own Observations do concur with those of the other, or that he
is assur'd that his own are more exact than those.</P>
<P>But, Fourthly, And, molt especially, he should not be deter'd, but much
rather excited, since without such Corrections of the places of the fixt Stars
nothing can be done in any other Caelestial Observation, and consequently
such a part of a Man's time, as to this design, will be wholly lost.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Observations in order to re∣gulate the Pla∣nets motions.</NOTE> But to
proceed with what I was saying concerning the Observations requisite for the
regulation of the Theories of the Planets; I say, supposing the true places
of the fixt Stars, as to their Longitude and Latitude, were known, and sup∣posing
we had, from distant Observations, the Moons true distance from
the Center of the Earth, and her apparent Diameter at that time, we
might easily, by the Telescope, find her distance at all other times, and by
<PB N="504" REF="483"/>
her appulse to certain Stars, or distance from them, together with the time
of the Observation and her apparent Diameter, we might easily know her
true Position among the fixt Stars, in respect of the Center of the Earth;
and if such Observations were continu'd every Day for some Months, or ra∣ther
some Years, we might expect another kind of Theory than any we
have hitherto had of the Moon. Now the best time for making all these
Observations of the Moon, should be when it can, with convenience, be
perform'd when the Moon comes just to the Meridian; at that time the
Moon being least incumbr'd with Refraction and Parallax; and as for the re∣ducing
of her Orbit to the Eccliptick, that will be easily enough done after∣wards,
when her passage among the fixt Stars is once well known; and, by
the way, methinks it would be the best way for any such Observator not to
puzzle or prepossess himself with many Notions, Suppositions, Theories and
Hypotheses, but rather to lay aside for a while, at least, all those Opinions of
determinate Orbs, and Epicycles and Excentricks, and Circles and Elipses,
or any other pre-conceiv'd Notion, and only to make and regulate the Ob∣servations
so (the manner of which I have already shewn) that the true Place
or Position of the Moon, among the fixt Stars of the Zodiack, in respect of
the Center of the Earth; and her true distance from the Center of the
Earth in that Position, might be accurately found out and Register'd; for by
a good number of such Observations and Collections, we should not only be
able to examine more narrowly all the already famous Hypotheses, and to
overthrow them perhaps, but to raise and excogitate divers others, such as
would at least rest upon a more sure Foundation, and if carefully and consi∣derately
built be of a more sound and substantial Structure.</P>
<P>Nor should these kinds of Observations be made of the Moon only, but of
the Sun. <HI>Mercury,</HI> ♀, ♂, ♃, and ♄; for tho' indeed their true distances
from the Center of the Earth are not so easily known (tho' indeed we know
not yet neither to how great a certainty Industry may bring us even in this
particular also) tho', I say, the true distances of these Bodies from us be
very difficult to be round, yet their comparative distances may much more
easily; for, by the help of a very good Telescope, we may at all times ob∣serve
their apparent Diameters most exactly, and consequently since, as I
have shew'd the last Day, the apparent Diameters and Distances are Reci∣procal,
we might have their comparative distances, and perhaps also from
comparing several Circumstances we might come by their true ones also.
For supposing we had the distance of the Sun and Earth (the most likely way
for finding which I shall anon explain) we might possibly find those of the o∣ther
Planets by some such way as this, namely, by the accurate Observation
of their apparent Diameters with an excellent Telescope of forty or rather
threescore Foot long, when they are nearest approaching their being hid by
the Beams, and when they are in their opposition to the Sun; for by the
comparing of these two we might be inform'd of the proportion between
their distances at those times, and consequently the difference of those two,
seeming, for the most part, to be ascribable to the great Orb of the Earth.
It will not be difficult, from many of these Observations, to determine the
proportion of the Diameter of the great Orb of the Earth to the Diameters
of the Orb of <HI>Saturn,</HI> of the Orb of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and of that of <HI>Mars;</HI> the
Diameters also of <HI>Venus</HI> in her retrograde Conjunction with the Sun, and in
her direct; that is, when she is in her nearest and farthest distance from the
Earth, will very much help towards the finding the proportion of the Orb
of <HI>Mercury</HI> about the Sun to that of the Earth.</P>
<P>As for the finding the true distance of the Sun, the best way would be by
means of two Observators, plac'd as far asunder as they could be conveni∣ently;
which two should either at certain times of the Year (namely, when
the Sun is in or very near either of the Solstices) observe by the help of a
Quadrant (which I shall another time more fully describe) by which the Alti∣tude
of any Caelestial Body may be observ'd to second Minutes; they should,
I say, with such a Quadrant observe most exactly the Meridian heights of
the Sun when in the Solstice, being each of them most exactly assur'd of the
true height of the Pole by observing the greatest and least height of some

notable Star within the Artick Circle by means of this Instrument. And
'tis not unlikely but that by this means, these two Observators, comparing
their Observations, may be able to deduce the Parallax of the Sun. But sup∣posing
that be exceeding difficult and scarce feasable, yet some Ecclipse of the
Sun may so fall out as to be discernable by both; and then from the comparing
of such Observations made by each, 'twill be no difficult matter, supposing
the distance of the Moon known, to know that of the Sun also: And ha∣ving
its true distance once given, together with its apparent Diameter at
that time, its distance at any other time will be easily enough found, sup∣posing
its Diameter only observ'd.</P>
<P>Having found this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of finding the Earth's Or∣bit.</NOTE> it will be easy, by Observations, to find out the Orbit
of the Sun or Earth, and the Velocity of either of them in any part of it;
and this will be by accurately observing and comparing the Appulse of the
Sun and any notable fixt Star, whose Longitude and Latitude is certainly
known to the Meridian; observing likewise the exact Meridian Altitude of
the Sun, together with its apparent Diameter. For performing of these
Observations as they should be,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three things necessary.</NOTE> there will be three things requisite besides
what I have already describ'd, which was the Telescope; and those three
things are, First, An exact Meridian Line or Instrument for Azymuths.
Secondly, A most exact and manageable Quadrant for observing Altitudes.
And, Thirdly, A most accurate Time-keeper, Watch, or Clock, each of which
I shall describe in their order.</P>
<P>I did, the last Day, shew the necessity of regulating the places of the fixt
Stars before they could be made use of for finding the true place of any of
the Planets, for I then hinted how much many of them had been found to
deviate from the places assign'd them by <HI>Ticho.</HI> But because it would be very
difficult to rectify all the Constellations I then hinted; that it would be suf∣ficient
for most Observations, if only those Stars were regulated, which were
the most conspicuous or notable in or near the Zodiack; and for this pur∣pose
I did likewise then delineate and describe a new and most exact Instru∣ment,
which I judg'd the most convenient for that purpose, of any that has
yet been made use of, it being an Instrument very easily manageable, very
little subject to Error from the make, and if diligence be us'd, such as will easily
enough distinguish every four Seconds. I did indeavour likewise to shew the
manner of rectifying it, and using it for those Observations. And indeed, if only
a Caelestial Globe of all the fixt Stars were to be made, wherein only the Re∣spect
and Position of the Stars one to another were to be noted, there needed
no other Instrument; but because their particular Respects also, both to the
Poles of the World, and to the Poles of the Eccliptick, that is, to the
Poles of the diurnal and annual motion of the Earth, or rather indeed the
places of those Poles among them are to be taken notice of, therefore other
Instruments also will be requisite Those I mention'd the last Day would be
three, and those were, First, An exact Meridian Line. Secondly, A most
exact Quadrant for taking Altitudes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">To draw a true Meridian.</NOTE> And, Thirdly, An exact Watch or
Time-keeper. As for a Meridian Line the most exact way of obtaining it
(to omit now several more common which I before hinted) is by observing
by the help of certain Perpendiculars, the most Eastern and Western Excur∣sions
of some Star not far remov'd from the Pole at least somewhere plac'd
within the Artick Circle. The manner of doing which may, in short, be
this, Fix to some convenient Beam a very long Perpendicular or Plumb-line,
whose suspending String should be of Brass-wire of a smaller size, to the end
of which should be hung a Plummet of Lead, almost as big as the Wire will
conviniently bear; this Plummet should be so inclos'd within a Box, that it may
conveniently move, so as to draw the Line Perpendicular, and yet be shelter∣ed
from the motions and disturbances of the outward Air. To the North
of this, at a good distance, the farther the better, from a convenient Beam
suspend two other Perpendicular Lines carefully prepar'd and fitted accord∣ing
to the directions I gave for the former, and fix them so, that by looking
by the first, and one of these, you may be able to see the most Eastern Ex∣cursion,
and by the first and the other of them, the most Western Excursion
of the Pole-star, or any other within the Artick Circle. And having these
<PB N="506" REF="485"/>
three Perpendiculars thus exactly regulated, it will not be difficult to suspend
a fourth, so as that by looking by the first and fourth, the Angle made by
the second, first and third, may be divided into two equal parts: Between the
tops of these two Perpendiculars, extend also another small Wire which shall
lie most exactly in the Meridian Line. And this I judge to be the most accur∣ate
way of any I have yet met with for finding the Meridian Line, and the most
convenient for the uses hereafter to be mention'd. This Line will denote out
the imaginary Circle which passes through the Pole of the World or of the
diurnal Motion of the Earth, or the Pole of the Horizon or the Zenith of the
place:<NOTE PLACE="marg">To find the Pole.</NOTE> And this being found it will be exceeding easy to find the exact place
of the Pole in it. Not by the Meridian Altitudes of the Sun; which is to
suppose that already most exactly known, which we shall afterward examine
and find out; but by taking most exactly the height of any Star within the
Artick Circle, when by these Perpendiculars it be found to be in the Meri∣dian;
for if by an exact Quadrant its height be observ'd when it crosses the
Meridian below and above the Pole; and half the difference of those two
heights be added to the least elevation or height found, it will give the exact
Point among the fixt Stars, to which the Poles of the Earth do at that time tend:
I say at that time, because it has been found that the Poles of the diurnal Mo∣tion
of the Earth do in time change and alter their places among the fixt Stars,
so as to describe a kind of Circle about a Point, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in or very near the Poles of
the Eccliptick or Annual motion of the Earth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Earths annual motion and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the Eccliptick.</NOTE> I say, in or very near, be∣cause
it has not been yet certainly determin'd what the variation of the Poles of
the Eccliptick or the annual motion o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Earth is; and tho' various Astro∣nomers
have excogitated several Hypotheses, whereby they indeavour to
make the variation of the Obliquity of the Eccliptick regular, and tho' some
have ascrib'd that variation of that Obliquity to proceed from a motion of
the fixt Stars, others from the variation of the very Orb of the Sun or Earth,
others to the variation of the Aequinoctial; yet I cannot find by all the Ob∣servations
that have hitherto been recorded, that the matter can be ac∣curately
determin'd; for since the places of the Stars, set down by the An∣tients,
have been found by the noble <HI>Ticho</HI> to be in many particulars very
false; and since that even of those exact and diligent Observations of <HI>Ticho,</HI>
there are lately found, by the excellent <HI>Hevelius,</HI> as I hinted the last Day, so
many of them most egregiously differing from those Places and Positions they
are plac'd in by <HI>Ticho,</HI> what hope is there of bringing that to any certainty
where the Ground-work or Foundation of Observations on which the Theo∣ries
are to be built, are so unstable and uncertain? For either there can
be no certain credit given to any Observations to be met with in Authors;
or if there be, I see, no reason why we may not affirm even the very ap∣parent
distance of the fixt Stars one from another, or their Positions or Re∣spects
among themselves to be alter'd, and this or that Star to be really in
an other Position to the Circumambient fixt Stars; that is, really to appear in
an other place of the Heaven at this Day, than it did in the times of the
Antient Astronomers. Now if this be so, it will be yet a further dispute,
whether this has been caus'd by some slow motions of those Stars one among
another; or whether by the alteration of the very Systeme of the Sun in re∣spect
of them; and tho' the first seem the more probable, there having of late
Years been observ'd very strange variations and alterations as to Magnitude
even among those fixt Stars; witness those several new Stars which have ap∣pear'd
and disappear'd, and vary'd their Magnitudes to all degrees almost
[witness also those Comets which have been by the latest and best Astrono∣mers
judg'd to be above the Orbs of the Planets, and to be equal'd with the
Region of the fixt Stars;] [as to instance in no other than that new Star
which has so many times appear'd and disappear'd in the Neck of <HI>Caetus</HI> which
was observ'd by <HI>Hevelius</HI> in the Year 1660, and does not, that I can find,
appear at this time, no not through a Telescope.] Tho', I say, these parti∣culars
might make it most probable, that those transpositions have heen made
even in the Regions of Stars; yet 'tis not impossible but that some variati∣ons
even in the Systeme of the Sun, may make some sensible difference. And
this, by the way, minds me of a thing which I have several Years since pro∣pounded
<PB N="507" REF="486"/>
as a thing worthy examination and experiment, and that is to be,
by fixing a long and good Telescope directly against that Star of the Dragon,
which is little more than three Degrees distant from the Pole of the Ecclip∣tick,
when in the Meridian,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To examine that motion.</NOTE> and to observe whether by that means there
cannot be found a manifest difference between the Elevation or Altitude of
it at two distant times of the Year; that is, supposing those two Observa∣tions
to be made at half a Years distance; for to me it seems not unlikely
but that the annual Orb of the Earth (if such a motion it have) may, by this
means, be perceiv'd to describe a small Circle about the Pole of the Ecclip∣tick.</P>
<P>For since by a thirty six Foot Telescope it is exceeding easy to distinguish
the Seconds of a Degree,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This was wrote before the Au∣thors <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttempt for the Earth's motion.</NOTE> nay, almost Thirds, 'tis <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot improbable but that
the annual Orb of the Earth may describe a Circle about the Pole of the
Eccliptick, whose apparent Diameter may at least amount to some Seconds if
not Minutes. And there seems not any more likely way in the World of
determining the Truth or Falsity of the Copernican Systeme than by this
means. Now, tho' these Stars which lie nearest the Pole of the Eccliptick, if
other particulars be answerable, were the best for this kind of Observation,
yet the Observation of the Pole-star may perhaps be sufficient; for if the
difference of the Meridian Altitudes of those Stars that are near the Poles
of the Eccliptick be considerable, those Stars also which are very near the
Poles of the World, cannot chuse but have a sensible variation; and conse∣quently
also the Pole of the diurnal motion of the Earth will describe a small
Ellipse near the Pole-star, which 'tis not unlikely but some such way as this
may, by several Circumstances, detect. But to return to what I was saying a∣bout
the manner of examining the places of the fixt Stars. I say, it were
extreamly desirable that a Caelestial Globe were so made, that the exact Place
and Positions of all the Stars, in respect of one another, were most acturate∣ly
determin'd and delineated, without any regard at all to the Eccliptick or
Aequator; that is, that the distances of the Stars from one another might,
by accurate Observations to be made with the double Telescope, be defin'd,
after which, from a sufficient number of accurate Observations to be made,
as I shall by and by direct, the true Eccliptick or way of the Sun or Earth a∣mong
these Stars should be exactly found out and delineated: For it is
sufficiently evident from the various Theories and Hypotheses, and Tables of
Astronomers, and by the variations of them all from Observations, how much
they are all of them hitherto to seek in many particulars, not only in a
great measure of the true Motion or Velocity of the Sun or Earth in the
Eccliptick Line, but somewhat also of the very Position of the Eccliptick-line
itself, and consequently all the Aequations of times which are deduc'd
from these, are somewhat uncertain also. Now for finding out the Ec∣cliptick,
the best way would be, First, To find out the true Point or Pole of
the World, which may with care be most accurately done. Next the Aequa∣tor
or Aequinoctial Circle should be found, and for the Time and Year when
the Observations are to be made, the Declination and right Ascension of some
of the most notable Stars near the Aequator; that is, taking for the time the
Longitude and Latitude of the Stars to be reckon'd after the same manner
as the Longitude and Latitude of places on the Earth are, namely, by tak∣ing
a Meridian or great Circle passing through the Pole of the World, and
any notable fixt Star, and for the present placing that as the first Meridian,
as 'twere; then taking notice of the right ascension of the most notable Stars
in respect of that Point where that great Circle cuts the Aequator, making
some allowance in all the following Observation for the procession of the
Aequinoxes, according as I shall by and by direct; and instead of the true
Latitude of the Stars from the Eccliptick, which we will suppose yet to be
sought, at least which we design hereby to examine, to take their Declina∣tion
<HI>pro tempore,</HI> from the Aequinoctial Circle. But because neither these nor
the following Observations can be well made without the two other Instru∣ments
I formerly hinted; therefore in the next place I shall indeavour to de∣scribe
those and the manner of using them.</P>
<P><PB N="508" REF="487"/>
And First, For a Quadrant to observe the Altitudes and Angles of the
fixt Stars or Planets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The description of the Quadr∣ant.</NOTE> which shall be exceeding light, small and easily manage∣able,
and yet shall be adapted so as to distinguish an Angle as exactly as a
Quadrant made the usual way,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 10. Fig. 2.</NOTE> shall be capable of performing, tho' it be
twenty times bigger in Diameter, I shall add this following Description.</P>
<P>Prepare a Quadrant of Brass or Wood, or any other convenient Substance,
that will neither warp nor shrink, such as ABC in the Figure, whose Radius
PB may be about sixteen or eighteen Inches long, more or less; let, to one
side of it, be fastned a long, square, hollow piece, as AD, of the same sub∣stance,
and about a Foot longer than the Radius of the Quadrant having a
perforation through the whole length of it, of about an Inch over, to serve
for the Tube of a three Foot Telescope on the out side of the piece; suspen∣ded
a Perpendicular or Plumb-line FE, whose Plummet F may be large and
heavy; then prepare a small long Index, shaped in the manner of that in
the Figure IHG, which should be of some matter that is exceeding light and
stiff, such as the outside of a Cane, or the like; and so order'd, that the
short end GH may counterpoise the longer HJ; which longer HJ should be
taper'd into a very small and slender Stern, and point towards I: Into the part
H of this should be let in a small piece of Brass k, into which should be
drill'd an exceeding small and fine Hole or Center, the smaller the better, so
that it will indure the finest Steel Wire tho' as small as the Hair of a Man's
Head to pass through it, and no more; for the more curious and exact this
contrivance be made, by so much the more exact will the Instrument itself
prove: At the bigger end of this slender Index G, fix a small piece of Brass
which may stand above the Plain about a quarter of an Inch, as X, and in
the midst of it cut a very small slit only just big enough for the Plumb-line
FE, to slide or be thrust between it. Having thus prepar'd this Index, by
means of a small Steel Wire coming out of a hole in the middle Line of the
Tube AD, at a convenient place of it, put on this Index, so that the small
top of it, I, may reach and point to the small cross at F; the other end of
this Wire passes through the hole of a small bended Arm of Brass NH, and
is there fastned. Having thus fitted on this Index and hung on the Plumb-line
EF, making it pass through the small slit of the Brass X, that is erected
upon the bigger end of the Index GHI, set the piece AD Perpendicular,
which you will be able to do to the greatest exactness imaginable; for by
means of this small Index, if the piece AD be never so little out of its Per∣pendicularity,
the top of the Index I, will make it most visible; so that by
this means you may come to as great an exactness as if the piece AD, and the
Plumb-line, were above sixty Foot long; for the end of the Index HI being
near thirty Inches, and the Plumb-line being somewhat longer, and the shor∣ter
end of this Index being but one Inch, or the thirtieth part of the length,
it will follow, that whatsoever motion is impress'd on the shorter end of the
Index G, will be thirty times more sensible at the smaller end of the Index F,
and consequently that the same exactness of Perpendicularity will be found,
as if the length of the Perpendicular or Plumb-line were thirty times in∣creas'd
or lengthen'd, which would amount to more than threescore Foot.
But thus far I have only explicated the way of setting the Quadrant most ex∣actly
Perpendicular. The next thing I am to shew is, how it will be able to
determine Altitudes, not only to Minutes, but even to Seconds. The con∣trivance
for performing which effect, for measuring, is this, Let the edge
of the Quadrant BC be made of Brass, tho' the rest of the Quadrant be o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Wood; let this edge be an Inch thick at least, and rounded most exactly
and truly to the Center P; upon which Center P, make a Ruler PR to move,
and on this fix a small Telescope MO of the same length with AD, namely,
about three Foot long, having a very good Object-glass at M, and a very
deep Eye-glass at O, and by this Glass the Position of an Object may more
nicely be distinguish'd than it can be by any common sights, tho' they be plac'd
more than sixty Foot asunder: And for the exact determination of the An∣gle
that this visual Ray makes with the Perpendicular I, cause to be plac'd
upon this Tube and Ruler a flat Circular Plate VXY, of about two Foot
Diameter, the Limb of which I divide into three equal Parts, and each of
<PB N="509" REF="488"/>
those I subdivide again into sixty Parts, and each of those sixty I again sub∣divide
into sixty more; so that the whole Circumference, which will be
about six Foot and a quarter, will be divided into ten Thousand eight Hun∣dred
parts; for thrice sixty will be one Hundred and Eighty, and sixty
times one Hundred and Eighty will make one Thousand eight Hundred;
which number of divisions it will easily enough bear, by means of Diagonals.
This Circle is so fixt on the Ruler, that the Center of it Q may be distant
from the edge or limb of the Quadrant BC, exactly one One Hundred and
twentieth part of that Diameter; then prepare a small Cylinder of Brass,
whose Diameter may be exactly the sixtieth part of the Radius PB, and
whose length may be equal to the thickness of the edge or reim of the Qua∣drant;
let this, by means of two small Centers or Pins, be mov'd in the
hole, on the end of which Axis is put a small light Index ST; these things
being so prepar'd, by means of a small String which is stretch'd on the broad
edge of the Quadrant BC, and at the same time rould about and fix'd to
the Cylinder Q; this Cylinder Q is so held by it, that, by the moving
the Ruler PR three Degrees on the edge of the Quadrant, the small Cy∣linder
Q makes a perfect Revolution, and consequently also the Index ST
will make a compleat Revolution also: So that the Hand making a Revo∣lution
every three Degrees, and every of those three Degrees having a space
o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> length of above twenty five Inches, it will not be difficult, as I shew'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ore, to divide each of those Spaces into sixty Minutes, and each of those
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Minutes into sixty Seconds. And this is that Instrument, which, if
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Care and Art be us'd in the making of it, and in the manner of ob∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing
will be found as exact as a Quadrant of thirty or forty times that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dius, if not more, and for its lightness and smallness will be easily ma∣nageable
and portable. I shall not now stay to shew the manner of rectifying
and using it, but shall refer it to some other opportunity.</P>

<P><HI>JVne</HI> 25. 1685. I have, in my former Lectures, explain'd those imaginary
Lines upon the Surface of the Earth, which are of use in Navigation,
and are found by the help of Caelestial Observations, <HI>viz.</HI> First, Meridians,
being great Circles which pass through the two Poles of the Earth. And,
Secondly, Parallels; namely, lesser Circles which are parallel to the Aequa∣tor,
that great Circle which divides the Surface of the Earth into the No∣thern
and Southern Hemispheres: And have shewn you, that all indea∣vours
in the Art of Navigation, is to be able to find out the proper Circle
of both kinds, which is peculiar to the place of the Ship. How the Paral∣el
Circle is found I have also shew'd, <HI>viz.</HI> how the Latitude of a place, or the
distance of it from the Aequinoctial Line, is to be found by Caelestial Ob∣servations,
either of the Sun in the Day time, or of the fix'd Stars in the
Night; the methods of which are very easy, and commonly known
and practis'd, tho' not without considerable defects both in the Instruments
and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mmon practise of Observation, as I shall explain more at large
when I treat concerning the Nautical Instruments, and their use at Sea.</P>
<P>I have likewise explain'd the ways of finding the Position of the Meridian,
or the North and South Line of a place, by the help of Caelestial Observa∣tions,
and of the Magnetical Needle, and at the same time of finding how
much that Magnetical Needle or Compass doth vary there-from either to∣wards
the East, or towards the West. But this is only the finding of the
Meridian consider'd as an Azymuth Circle, and not the finding of the Me∣ridian
peculiar to the place in respect of any other Meridian which passeth
through some other place; which is that which is requir'd to the determina∣tion
of the Position of a place upon the Surface of the Earth in respect of
the Parallel and Meridian, which is the main end of Geography and Navi∣gation.</P>
<P>The finding then of the Meridian of a place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What the Lon∣gitude is.</NOTE> which I here intend, is the find∣ing
which of all the infinite Meridian Circles which pass through the two Poles
and cut the Aequinoctial at right Angles, is the Meridian that passes through
the place where, or for which the inquiry is made; that is, what Angle that
Meridian maketh at the Pole with any other known or determin'd Meridian
that passes through any other known and assign'd place, or what part or
parts of the Aequinoctial Circle are intercepted between the two Points
where the said Meridians cut the said Circle. This is that Ploblem which
<PB N="511" REF="490"/>
is call'd the finding of the Longitude of a Place, and which hath for so long
a time puzzl'd all the Geographers, Astronomers, and Geometricians to find
out a demonstrative and practical way to resolve; and which, nothwith∣standing
the multitude of ingenious attempts that have been made for that
purpose, doth hitherto remain an unsolvable Problem, especially at all times
and at Sea, where the most <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e of it would be. Not but that much hath been
done towards it, by various inventions, which, tho' not compleat and per∣fect
in their kind, are yet of very great use in Geography and Navigation,
as I shall by and by shew. But the perfecting of this Art is, yet as a thing want∣ing
in the World, and very much sought for. And this the more, because
Geography and Navigation are lame without it, having but one of its two
Leggs good and sound, the other being but a Stilt or Prop; however it
hath hitherto serv'd to carry on the practice of Navigation, by which the
greatest part of the World hath been not only discover'd but Traded to, and
by means hereof every one part almost of the Earth, especially of Maritine
Parts hath Communication with every other. It will therefore deserve to
be inquir'd into and describ'd as to that state of Perfection and Practice
which it hath now attain'd; that from the knowledge from what state it is
in at present, we may be the better able to discover its Defects, and what
it further wants to make it compleat and perfect.</P>
<P>The helps then that have been propounded or made use of hitherto for
finding the difference of Longitude between two places, or the Angle that
their respective Meridians make at the Pole, may be reduc'd to these seven
general Heads.</P>
<P>First, Astronomical,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seven methods for finding the Longitude.</NOTE> such as depend only upon Caelestial Motions and
Observations.</P>
<P>Secondly, Hodometrical; such as depend upon the Mensuration and Com∣putation
of Course and Distance.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Magnetical; such a depend wholly upon Magnetical Proprieties
and Instruments.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Chronometrical; such as depend upon an exact Mensuration and
Computation of Time.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Mechanical; such as depend upon some Mechanical Inventions,
and have no relation to any of the former.</P>
<P>Sixthly, Physical; such as depend wholly upon some Physical Proprieties
of the Body of the Earth.</P>
<P>Seventhly, Mixed or Compounded ways, making use of two, or more, of
the former six principal Heads.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Astrono∣mical methods.</NOTE> Then, for the Astronomical Methods, or such as depend wholy up∣on
Caelestial Motions and Observations; there have been divers ways thought
of, all which may be reduc'd to two Heads.</P>
<P>First, Such as depend only upon some Caelestial appearance made for the
effecting of this Inquiry in several parts of the same Hemisphere, without
respect to Astronomical Tables. Or,</P>
<P>Secondly, Such as depend upon the truth of Astronomical Tables, calcu∣lated
for some known Meridian, to which such Observations may be referr'd,
and the Longitude of any place, where such an Observation is made, may be
presently deduc'd. Now, tho' no Astronomical Tables have been so perfect
and compleat as to perform what is necessary, yet they have notwithstanding
been founded upon a true Ground and Principle, and have failed only upon
the account of the Imperfection of the Theories yet known o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Caelestial mo∣tions,
a help for which I intend shortly to publish.</P>
<P><PB N="512" REF="491"/>
The first way is by the Ecclipses of the Moon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Six of them.</NOTE> observ'd either at several
places, or at one place only.</P>
<P>The second way is by observing the place of the Moon crossing or reduc'd
to the Eccliptick.</P>
<P>The third way is by observing the true place of the Moon in any part of
her Orb or Dragon, which is various ways perform'd, either by taking her
distance from one or more fix'd Stars, or from Altitudes taken in known Azy∣muths.</P>
<P>The fourth way is by observing, with a good Telescope, the progress of
the Light and Darkness over the spots and marks in the Face of the Moon.
These four last ways suppose a perfect Theory, and Tables of the Lunar mo∣tions,
both which are yet wanting.</P>
<P>The fifth way is by the Satellites of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> or by the fix'd spot in one of
the Belts of <HI>Jupiter;</HI> and this either observ'd at divers places, or at one only.
This last supposeth a perfect Theory and Tables of the motion of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s
Satellites, which are yet wanted.</P>
<P>The sixth is by the Satellites of <HI>Saturn.</HI> These two last ways are to be ob∣serv'd
by the help of long Telescopes, without which, the motions and ap∣pearances
requisite for this purpose, cannot be observ'd; and therefore 'till
better Telescopes be found than those we have at present (such as, tho' of
but a short and manageable length, as of three or four Foot, will yet make
the appearances as plain as one of those we now use of thirty or thirty six
Foot long) these ways will be of little or no use upon the Sea, tho' they may
be of very considerable use upon the Land in those Towns or parts where the
Ship has occasion to stay. First, Because they happen very often in compari∣son
of Lunar Ecclipses: And, Secondly, Because by Observations of these
kinds made on the Land at such places, compar'd with Observations made at
any other known place, the difference of Longtitude between those places
will be rectify'd, and consequently they will much help to the rectifying
Mapps or Chards, which is one very necessary Instrument to be made use
of in Navigation.</P>
<P>Now for the better understanding of all these Astronomical wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣quiring
the Longitude of a place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some things p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nised.</NOTE> It is necessary to pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mise some praecog<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
which are necessary to be known, in order to a better comprehension of the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></P>
<P>It is to be observ'd then, that every place upon the Surface of the Eart<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
hath a Caelestial as well as a Terrestrial Meridian, that is, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>maginary
plain of the Meridian of each place suppos'd extended to the Orb of the
fix'd Stars, doth design an imaginary Line among them; which, as the ima∣ginary
Meridians upon the Earth are suppos'd to pas through the <HI>Arctick</HI> and
<HI>Autarctick</HI> Poles or Points upon the Surface of the Earth, so the imaginary
Meridians answering to them in the Heavens, arc suppos'd to pass through
the two Poles of the Aequinoctial in the Heavens, upon which is made the
diurnal motions of the Heavens in the Ptolomaick Hypothesis. When there∣fore
the Sun is seen in any place to be in the Meridian of that place it is
twelve of the Clock at that place, but at no other place whatsoever but
such as lie under the same Meridian, for to all other places it is either before
or after Noon. So that as many Degrees as a place lies Eastward of the
place in which the Sun is at that present in the Meridian, by so many De∣grees
doth the Sun there appear to have past it, and by how many it lies
more West, by so many doth the Sun want of coming to its Meridian; and
because the Sun passeth three hundred and sixty Degrees in twenty four
Hours, and consequently fifteen Degrees in an Hour, and fifteen Minutes in
a Minute, and fifteen Seconds in a Second of Time, therefore it is easy to
reduce the Degrees and Minutes of the difference of Longitude to Hours
and Minutes of Time, and contrary wise, to reduce Hours, Minutes and
Seconds of Time to Degrees, Minutes and Seconds of Longitude.</P>
<P>This being premis'd, I come next to the Explication of the Astronomical
methods</P>
<P>The First then,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first me∣thod by Ec∣clipses of the Moon.</NOTE> and principal, which hath been often practic'd, and
which hath been of very good use for discovering the Longitude of Places,
is that by an Ecclipse of the Moon, observ'd first in differing places at the
<PB N="513" REF="492"/>
same moments of universal time, but at different Local times: This Eclipse of
the Moon being an accidental darkning of the whole or some part of the
Moon's Face, by reason of the Moon's passage through some part of the
conical shadow of the Body of the Earth, becomes visible to more than a
Hemisphere of the Surface of the Earth. So that if the same were observ'd
accurately in as many places as it could be seen at, this alone would shew
the true Longitude of all those places in respect of one another, and would be
a means to rectify the Mapps for all such parts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Local time what.</NOTE> By Local time, I mean that
denomination of one and the same instant of universal time which it receives
in several places, from the respect that the Caelestial Bodies have at that in∣sant
to the Horizons and Meridians of those several places; because the
same instant that is call'd twelve a Clock in one place where the Sun appears
in the Meridian, is in other places call'd, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, a
Clock, and all other denominations of Minutes, Seconds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that can be in
the twenty four Hours of the Day. Now the beginning and end of an E∣clipse
of the Moon being made in less than a Minute of time (for it is easy,
by the naked Eye, to discover, within less than a Minute, when the real
shadow just touches the Limb of the Moon, and by the Telescopes to disco∣ver
to less than a quarter of a Minute) if those times be diligently observ'd
in several places, and adjusted exactly to the Local times of those places,
the different Local times being compar'd will give the different Longitude of
those places in respect of one another; for every Hours difference of time
gives fifteen Degrees difference, and every minute of time gives fifteen mi∣nutes
of a Degree of Longitude: And by so much the sooner or earlier in
the Local time of the Natural Day or each place it appears, by so much the
more Westwardly is the place situated; and by so much the later the same
appearances are seen in each place, by so much the more Eastwardly is the
situation of that place. 'Tis true, that in such places where the Eclipse
appeareth near the Horizon, respect ought to be had of the Refraction and
Parallax of the Moon, in giving the visible Position of the Moon in respect
of the fix'd Stars that may pass under or very near to it, when so Eclipsed;
but if we only regard the Local time, that may be exactly found by the fix'd
Stars, either by taking their Altitudes or observing their Transits by the
Meridian, without having any regard at all to either of them.</P>
<P>The whole uncertainty that happens to Observations of this kind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The difficulty in observing Eclipses of the Moon and how to obviate it.</NOTE> is only
from the difficulty of discovering the very moments of the beginning and
end of the Ecclipse, because of a certain penumbra or lesser shadow which
incompasseth this Conical shadow of the Earth; insomuch, that I have of∣ten
observ'd this Penumbra to dusk that Limb of the Moon which is next
the Cone for near half an Hour before the real shadow toucheth it, and for
as long after the real shadow is gone off from it, after the end of an Eclipse.
But generally the Umbra is so much differing from the Penumbra, that
one may, with ease, be certain; to less than a minute of time, when it
toucheth the Limb, especially in Immersions and Emersions out of the total
darkness in total Eclipses. Those that have the convenience of Telescopes
may have the particular intermediate times when the Umbra doth cover or
pass through the middle of some remarkable spots in the Face of the Moon
as the shadow comes on or goes off; because the Limb of the Umbra is much
more defin'd upon the Face of the Moon, when both the light and the dark
parts can be seen together; and 'twill not be difficult this way to be certain
to less than fifteen Seconds of Time, and consequently to be sure of the dif∣ference
of Meridians to le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s than four minutes of a Degree: which is as near
to exactness as need be, for most Geographical or Nautical Uses. For the use∣fulness
and practicableness of this way I could produce you multitudes of in∣stances
of the Rectification of the Longitudes of places from one another, and
consequently of the true ground of making or rectifying of Mapps; but I
shall only instance in one or two: The first shall be that which was made
by Captain <HI>Thomas James</HI> at <HI>Charlton</HI> in <HI>Hudson</HI>'s <HI>Bay, October</HI> the 29th 1631,
and by Mr. <HI>Henry Gellibrand</HI> professor of Astronomy in this House, where
he, with several other Friends, made the Observation of the same Eclipses.
Now, after the return of the said Captain <HI>James,</HI> Mr. <HI>Gellibrand</HI> comparing
<PB N="514" REF="493"/>
the two Observations together, found that the Meridian of <HI>Charlton</HI> was
Westward of the Meridian of <HI>London</HI> five hours eighteen minutes in Time;
or in Degrees of Latitude, 79°. 30'. This he verify'd also by another method,
of which I shall have occasion to speak hereafter, and found the difference of
Meridians of those two places to be in time 5h. 14m. or in Degrees of Lon∣gitude
78°. 30'. which differs from the former account but four minutes of
Time, or one Degree of Longitude. Now what difference did thus arise be∣tween
the account of the former, and the latter way is certainly to be ascri∣b'd to
the latter method, which was more complicated and depended upon
the truth of Tables, there being no Observation made here at this place to
correspond with Captain <HI>James</HI>'s made at <HI>Charlton:</HI> However, Mr. <HI>Gelli∣brand</HI>
in his appology thinks it may be the better born withal, since it could
come so near the truth in the finding the difference of Longitude of Places
so far remov'd; since very famous Authors, who have sought the Longitude
of Places by other methods, have differ'd from one another, and from the
truth so much more; for giving an instance of the situation of two eminent
Cities here in <HI>Europe,</HI> not very far from one another, and which have each
of them had very eminent Mathematicians and Astronomers, <HI>viz. Rome</HI> and
<HI>Norimberg: Regiomontanus</HI> makes their difference of Longitude <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6; <HI>Werner
32; Appian 34; Mestline</HI> and <HI>Origanus 33; Stof<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er 18; Maginus 26; Schonerus
12; Mercator</HI> and <HI>Handiuso 12. Stadius 13; Jans<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nius 10; Longomontanus 16;
Lausbergius 10;</HI> but <HI>Kepler</HI> by two Observations of two Lunar Ecclipses, made
according to this method, destroys them all, and proves them to be different
but only four minutes of Time.</P>
<P>So that we may plainly perceive that this method, if it be duly observ'd,
and the Observations accurately and judiciou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly made, is much to be prefer∣r'd
before divers others. And therefore I do very much wonder why the
Learn'd Dr. <HI>Vossius.</HI> in his late Treatise, that he hath publish'd concerning the
rectification of the Longitudes of places, should reject this way as fallacious
and uncertain, whereas tis most undeniably certain that 'tis infinitely to be
preferr'd before the other ways which he there mentions: And indeed con∣sidering
the facility and obviousness of it to any ones understanding, and
thence the practicableness of it by any of the most ordinary Capacity, and
with the least apparatus of Instruments, and without a supposition of the
perfection of Astronomical Tables; I think I may pronounce it the most
generally practicable way yet known; not but that several of the other A∣stronomical
ways which I am to explain, will, with great Care and Circum∣spection,
and convenient Instruments, together with intelligent Astronomers
to perform the Observations and Calculation, bring us to a much grea∣ter
preciseness. But since those Requisites are not at all times and places to
be procur'd, there is more of real good to be expected from this one me∣thod,
than from any other yet known; and to hint that only by the bye,
I find that this Observation of Captain <HI>James</HI> and Mr. <HI>Gellibrand</HI> doth prove,
that the most part of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Mapps have made that place in <HI>Hudsons-Bay</HI>
above ten Degrees of Longitude too much to the Westward.</P>
<P>There are other instances of this Nature might be produc'd to shew that
several parts of the East Indies are, in the Mapps, plac'd too far to the East∣ward,
contrary to the suppsition of Dr.<HI>Vossius</HI> in his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Treatise. But I shall
not now insist upon further proof of that which will be so easily understood
by any one, who shall well consider o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> its Principles.</P>
<P>Next to this way <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall annex that of observing the <HI>Satellites</HI> of <HI>Jupiter,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The secnd me∣thod by the</HI> Satellites of Jupiter.</NOTE> be∣cause
they are of the same Nature, and proceed upon the same Grounds.
And supposing the use of Telescopes to be practicable at Sea, would be
there of very great use, which I do not despare to see effected in a short time:
But for determining the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ongitudes of places upon the Land, Observations
may be made twenty times more exact, if a convenient apparatus of Instru∣ments
be procur'd, and diligent and knowing observers be made use of, and
this by reason of the almost momentary continuance of the appearance, that
is to be observ'd, which will thence be seen by all the observers at the same
instant almost of time; whereas there is a greater Latitude of uncertainty in
Eclipses of the Moon by reasonn of the Penumbra.</P>
<P><PB N="515" REF="494"/>
This way then by the <HI>Satellites</HI> of <HI>Jupiter</HI> to knowing and diligent Astrono∣nomers
is much to be preferr'd before that of <HI>Eclipses of the Moon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">This way pre∣ferrable.</NOTE> upon
three accounts. First, By reason of the frequency of appearances sufficient
for determining this Inquiry.</P>
<P>Secondly, Upon the account of the distinctness, exactness and preciseness
of the time of the appearance.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Upon the account of the easiness and facility of making the Ta∣bles,
and of calculating the time; there being little else to be consider'd, but
only the middle motions of them; at least, what inequalities soever it be in
their Anomaly, it is hardly sensible or worth taking notice of them.</P>
<P>First, For the frequency of appearances sufficient for this purpose; where∣as
of Lunar Eclipses we seldom have above one or two in a Year, of those
may be had one, two, or more almost every Night; and these for so long as <HI>Ju∣piter</HI>
is more than a Sextant from the Sun, are very conspicuous by the help
of a large Telescope; nay, within half that distance if the Position of the
Ecliptick do favour the appearance either in the Morning before the Sun
Rising, or in the Evening after the Sun Set: But the <HI>Satellites</HI> are most con∣spicuous,
when <HI>Jupiter</HI> is more than a Quadrant from the Sun. Now, that
this may be the better understood, it will be necessary to explain, in short,
the <HI>Mundus Jovialis:</HI> We are to know then, that <HI>Jupiter</HI> being the highest Pla∣net
but one, namely, <HI>Saturn,</HI> being view'd through a Telescope, is discover'd
to have around Body in Diameter, when acronical about 50'.. This Body
is observ'd to have several darker or dusky Belts which cross the Face of it
parallel to the Eccliptick, and by a conspicuous spot, which I first disco∣ver'd,
this Body is found to move round upon its Axis in about ten Hours
time; besides this, <HI>Galileo</HI> first discover'd that it had four smaller Planets,
which he call'd <HI>Satellites,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Satellites <HI>first observ'd by</HI> Galileo.</NOTE> which continually mov'd round about it; these,
by later Observations, compar'd with former, have been reduc'd to such a
Perfection, as that by Tables, made of their periodick Revolutions, the Po∣sitions
and Affections of them, for any certain time, can be pretty near as∣certain'd..
The first and innermost of these is distant about three Semidia∣meters,
and performs its Revolution in about 42½ Hours: The second is di∣stant
about five Semidiameters, and performs its Revolution in eighty five
hours and twenty minutes: The third is distant about 8 ½ Semidiameters,
and performs its Revolution in about one hundred seventy two Hours. The
fourth and outermost is distant about fourteen Semidiameters, and performs
its Revolution in near sixteen Days, eighteen Hours and a Quarter; or 402¼.
Hours.</P>
<P>THo' the distances and Revolutions of these secundary Planets differ very con∣siderably
from what the Learned Dr. <HI>Gregory</HI> in his late accurate <HI>Astrono∣miae,
Physicae &amp; Geometricae, Elementa,</HI> yet I have not presumed to alter
them, but have Printed them as the Author has left them: They are placed by
Dr.<HI>Gregory</HI> as follows. The innermost <HI>Satellite</HI> of <HI>Jupiter</HI> makes its Revolution
in one Day ¾ and is distant 5 ⅔ Semidiameters from the Center of <HI>Jupiter.</HI> The
second surrounds him in 3 ⅗ Days, and is distant nine Semidiameters, The third
in the space of 7 ⅙ Days, whose distance is 14 ⅓ Semidiameters. The fourth and last
in 16 ¾ Days,, and is distant 25 ⅓ Semidiameters. The distances are almost double,
whence the mistake of our Author proceeded, I know not, but I thought best to give
the intelligent this short Advertisement of it.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>R. W.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>Every one of these four in every Revolution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Satellites</HI> may serve for finding the Longitude in six Positions.</NOTE> have at least two remarkable
Positions fit for this purpose; some have four, some may make six remark∣able
Signals. The Signals fit for this purpose, are, First, Their touching
the Limb of the Body of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> either at their ingress or egress, and that
is also in every Revolution double: First, When they are in their superior
half of their Epicycle, and so move direct, they have their Ingress and E∣gress
behind the Body of <HI>Jupiter.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="516" REF="495"/>
Secondly, When they are in the lower half of their Epicycle and appear
Retrograde, they have their Ingress likewise, and their Egress from the Face
of <HI>Jupiter.</HI> Next when the outermost of them does not touch, but either
move above to the Northwards, or below to the Southwards, their Orbit
or Epicycle then appearing an Ellipsis, then there are at least two remarkable
Positions of them which will be fit for this purpose; that is, their direct Con∣junction
and their Retrograde Conjunction. Besides these, there are two sorts
of Eclipses; the first sort are those of the <HI>Satellites,</HI> that is, when the <HI>Satillites</HI>
enter into the dark Cone of the shadow of the Body of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> or when they
emerge or get out of it, both which may be sometimes plainly discover'd in
the same Revolution of the <HI>Satellite,</HI> at other times only one of them, that is,
either the Immersion or Emersion.</P>
<P>Secondly, There is an Eclipse also caus'd upon the Body of <HI>Jupiter</HI> by the
shadow of the <HI>Satellite,</HI> by which means one may, with a good Glass, plainly
perceive a dark spot or shadow entring the East Limb of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and passing
over some part of its Face, to leave the Body of <HI>Jupiter</HI> at its West Limb:
Each of these Transits of the shadow will afford three remarkable Instants or
Times fit for this purpose, namely, First, The Ingress of the Shadow or
Spot into the Face. Secondly, Its Position in the middle of the Line of its
Transit, which by region of either of the Belts upon the Face of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> or
the lateral Position of some of the other <HI>Satellites,</HI> may be easily discover'd.
And, Thirdly, The Instant when it goes off or leaves the Limb of <HI>Jupiter,</HI>
which are plainly enough discover'd by good Telescopes and diligent Obser∣vers.
So that since there are so many remarkable Accidents observable, scarce
any Night can pass without affording some one or more of those opportu∣nities.
Hence it will be sufficiently evident, that there will be above a
hundred convenient times to make such Observations more than can possibly
happen by means of Ecclipses of the Moon.</P>
<P>Besides these, there are other remarkable Conjunctions of the <HI>Satellites</HI>
themselves one with another, which will serve for proper Remarks, especi∣ally
at such times as <HI>Jupiter</HI> is in or very near the Eccliptick; for then the
plains of the Orbs of the <HI>Satellites</HI> are very near in the plain of the Ecliptick,
and the apparent motion of the <HI>Satellites</HI> is very near in a straight Line, and
so the Conjunction of one of them Retrograde in the lower part of its Epicy∣cle
with another of them direct in the upper part of its Epicycle, is very
short and momentary, and so becomes a fit mark for such an Observation.
The like may also be observ'd when <HI>Jupiter</HI> having a considerable Latitude the
way of the <HI>Satellites</HI> appears Elliptical; for then the Conjuction of two <HI>Satelli∣tes,</HI>
may, with sufficient accurateness, be observ'd.</P>
<P>Now any one of these remarkable appearances being view'd and exactly
observ'd by two Persons at differing places, if the times of such appearances
be exactly taken at both places, they will certainly give the difference of the
Longitude of those two places in the same manner, as I before shew'd, might
be done by Eclipses of the Moon; and consequently if the same appearance
were observ'd with the same care in a hundred places, the Longitudes of all
those places would be thereby ascertain'd, and that in the next place to a
much greater preciseness than 'tis possible to do by the help of Eclipses of
the Moon; because some of these may be distinguish'd almost as easily to a
Second of Time, as those of the Moon may be to a Minute, which ap∣pears
yet farther, First, By reason of the smallness of the Body of the <HI>Sa∣tellites.</HI>
Secondly, By reason of the great Velocity of all and much more of
the innermost or first, which is next the Body of <HI>Jupiter.</HI> Thirdly, By rea∣son
of the small distances of them, and especially of the two innermost from
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ody of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and consequently of the small Penumbra the shadow of
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ody there affords, which is also so much the more distinguish'd by reason
of the vast distance of the Sun, and thence of the great Dimination of its
Diameter, when view'd from the Body of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and thence the smallness
of the Angle of the Penumbra; for whereas the Angle of the Penumbra at
the Earth is about half a Degree, the Angle of the Penumbra at <HI>Jupiter</HI> will
not be more than 1/9 part of a Degree, the distance of the Earth from the Sun
to that of <HI>Jupiter</HI> being but as 10 to 45, or as 2 to 9. All which Particulars
<PB N="517" REF="496"/>
do contribute to the quickness and short duration of the appearance: So
that the Time is very precise and seen by a whole Hemisphere of the Earth,
as it were, in a moment; and there is no regard to be had of Parallax, and
nothing else to be taken notice of but the very precise time of the appear∣ance;
for this only gives the true difference of Longitude between all those
places where it shall be so observ'd by the same method, as I mention'd be∣fore
in Eclipses of the Moon.</P>
<P>The Difficulties that occur in this method,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The difficulties in this method.</NOTE> are, First, That pretty long
Telescopes are requisite for making the Observations and accurate Pendulum
Clocks, both which are as yet not practicable at Sea. But, as I said before,
notwithstanding this it may be made useful in Harbours and on Shore in such
places where Ships may reside, which will be of great use for rectifying the
Longitudes of Charts and Mapps.</P>
<P>A second Difficulty in this way, is the distinguishing of one of the <HI>Satellites</HI>
from the other: But for this the Theory of them is so far brought to per∣fection,
and was above twenty five Years since much advanc'd by my Prede∣cessor
the ingenious Mr. <HI>Laurence Rook,</HI> that the Positions and appearances of
the <HI>Satellites</HI> can be certainly Predicted and Calculated for any certain time;
and 'tis not difficult to make an Automaton or piece of Watch-work which
shall, at all times, give the Positions and appearances accurate enough for
such Observations, at least to direct an Observer at what time he is to expect
or watch for such an Appearance; and I have verify'd very many of Mr.
<HI>Rook</HI>'s Predictions and Ephemerides for those Appearances, and found them
pretty exact, even to less than a minute of Time. By which method if Ephe∣merides
be made for one, two, three or more Years, and sent abroad into
the East and West <HI>Indies,</HI> and other parts of the World, 'tis not unlikely
but many such Observations might be procur'd from several parts of the
World, which would be of great use, especially if at the same time there
were some in <HI>England</HI> that should constantly make the like Observations here
with equal care. And I have good reason to hope, that by this means we
may obtain the Longitudes of several places in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> since I un∣derstand
that the <HI>French</HI> King hath sent several very able Astronomers into
the <HI>East-Indies</HI> with an apparatus of sit Instruments, almost on purpose to
make these and such other curious and useful Observations.</P>
<P>Besides this I am certainly informed, that it hath been of late much practi∣sed
in <HI>France,</HI> whereby they have fix'd the Longitudes of the principal Towns
in <HI>France,</HI> and also that of <HI>Vraniburge</HI> in <HI>Denmark,</HI> and of <HI>Cayen</HI> in <HI>Iceland,</HI>
in the Possession of the <HI>French</HI> upon the Coast of <HI>Guiana</HI> in <HI>America.</HI> But
this only by the bye▪</P>
<P>But <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to proceed, the same thing may be done by the <HI>Satellites</HI> of <HI>Saturn;</HI>
but they being discover'd but of late, and so not yet brought to so perfect
a Theory, and besides requiring much longer and better Telescopes to observe
the Appearances; I shall forbear to discourse farther of them 'till those <HI>Desi∣derata</HI>
are procur'd; but whatever Invention will serve to detect their Ap∣pearances,
will be much more useful for observing the same of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> which
are much more near, and so much more vivid and conspicious.</P>
<P>The same thing may be done by observing the Appulses of the Moon to
any fix'd Star that lies in its way, when observ'd at several places of the
Earth, wherein the Appearance is so very short and precise, that even in the
space of a single Second of Time, a Star is seen and quite disappears behind
the Body of the Moon; but then by reason that both Refraction and Parallax
are to be accounted for, which are differing to every place where the Obser∣vation
shall be made, it is not fit for common use, but requires some better
skill in Astronomy than most Observers are furnish'd with, which I shall there∣fore
pretermit for the present, because I shall have occasion to treat more
largely of it when I explain those ways that do necessarily require a know∣ledge
of both those.</P>
<P>But still all these methods are useless as to the main design for which the
knowledge of the Longitude is desir'd; which is from Observations made
upon the place wherever it be, whether at Sea or on Land, and to deter∣mine
presently what is the Longitude of that place from any known Meridi∣an.
<PB N="518" REF="497"/>
This is that Invention which has hitherto puzzl'd all the Learned Men,
whether Mechanicks, Navigators, Geographers, Astronomers, Geometers
and Philosophers; among which, tho' there have been many pretenders, yet
no one has perform'd it, or shewn the way how to do it: 'Tis true, there
have been enough have shewn what things are requisite to do it, but no one
has produc'd those Requisites. 'Tis certain, that an exact Theory and Tables
of the motion of the Moon, or of the motion of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and his <HI>Satellites</HI>
would perform it; but those Theories and those Tables are hitherto want∣ing,
as are also exact Clocks that will move exactly upon the Sea, and such
Telescopes as tho' but of three Foot length, and so might be made use of
at Sea, would yet do as much as those we now have of thirty Foot; 'till which
be procur'd, these ways, that I have hitherto nam'd, will be of little use for
this purpose.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 12. 1685. I explain'd to you the last Term, several praecognita
necessary ro be known, in order to the finding the Longitude of any place
upon the globous Body of the Earth; that is, of finding the Angle that the
Meridian of that place maketh with any other determinate Meridian, whe∣ther
it be the prime Meridian generally agreed upon, or any other particular
Meridian of some notable place from which the Ship departs; whose re∣spect
to the prime Meridian, or the Meridians in the Chart made use of, is
known. In order to which I enumerated the several general ways that have
been hitherto thought of for effecting this end,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The several ways for find∣ing the Longi∣tude.</NOTE> namely, Astronomical, Ho∣dometrical,
Magnetical, Chronometrical, Mechanical, Physical, and Mixt.
Each of these ways I did more fully explain the last Term, and shew'd the
several bounds of them, as also the several Objections, Difficulties and Im∣perfections
each of them was subject to, and what they wanted to make them
compleat and useful; which I shall not now trouble you with the repetition
thereof, but rather proceed to the second method or general way of finding
the Longitude of places, or difference of Meridians. Namely, The</P>
<P>Hodometrical,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hodome∣trical way.</NOTE> or by the observation or computation of the way of the
Ship between place and place; that is, of observing the several Rumbs or
Lines in which the Ship saileth, and what way it hath made in every of those
Rumbs; that is, how many Leagues or parts of a League the Ship hath
pass'd in every Rumb it hath sail'd upon, and how to compute the same, and
thence to deduce the true place of the Ship at any time, in respect of the
place from whence the departure is made, or the difference of the Meridi∣ans
of the Ship, and that place, which is the Longitude desir'd. In order to
the better explication of which it will be necessary to explain the several
parts that are necessary Ingredients in every such Inquiry or Operation, that
so it may be perform'd the more knowingly and scientifically, and not by
wrote and ignorantly as it is now perform'd, for the most part, by practical
Navigators;<NOTE PLACE="marg">What the Rumb or Line of a Ships way is.</NOTE> and to that end it will be necessary to explain, First, What
kind of Line it is a Ship describcs upon the Surface of the Earth or Sea in its
passing or sayling through it, when steer'd upon a certain Point of the
Compass. Secondly, How that Line is found and distinguish'd from all other
Lines that may be describ'd upon the Surface of the Earth, for that it is a Line
not only differing from all other Lines upon the Surface, but because every
one of those Lines differ from every other of the same kind; and not only
so, but every part of each Line differs from every other part thereof in many
respects;<NOTE PLACE="marg">How it differs from all other Lines.</NOTE> as First, In its flexure or bending: Secondly, In respect of its pro∣portion
to the Meridians and Parallels, namely, as to the mensuration of
Latitude and Longitude: And, Thirdly, In respect of any other great or
lesser Circles that may be drawn, or suppos'd drawn upon the Surface of the
Earth; such as lesser Circles of distance from any one Point or Place; or
greater Circles, such as Lines of Position or great Azymuthal Circles. Nor
have I hitherto met with any Globe whereon the said Lines have been truly
describ'd, or any other that has prescrib'd a Scientifical or practical way of de∣scribing
the same.</P>
<P>The chief propriety then of this <HI>Rumb-line,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e chief Pro∣priety of the Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e.</NOTE> upon the Surface of the Globe,
is, that it always makes the same Angle with all the Meridional Lines or Cir∣cles
that it cuts or crosseth, and consequently that it is a <HI>Spherical-Spiral</HI> or
<PB N="519" REF="498"/>
<HI>Helix</HI> which incompasseth the same with infinite Revolutions which will ne∣ver
bring it to the two Polar Points which are the Centers, towards which it
tends both towards the North and towards the South; notwithstanding the
infinite Revolutions, yet it is a finite Line which beareth a certain proportion
to the length of a Meridian, and may be defin'd, determin'd and divided as
exactly as any other Line or Circle drawn upon the Face of the Globe, and
also the respect or proportion that any part of the whole Line beareth to
the Meridian or Parallel that it crosseth.</P>
<P>First, As to the length of any Rumb-line; I say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of its length and proportion to a great Cir∣cle.</NOTE> that it beareth the same
proportion to the length of a great Circle, that the Secant of that Rumb
Angle from the North or South, hath to the Diameter of the Globe; so
that tho' it maketh Infinite Revolutions about each Polar Point, and will
never arrive at it, yet are all these infinite Revolutions equal to a finite and
determinable length of a straight Line, and that to as great an exactness as
the proportion is or can be determin'd between the Radius or Diameter of a
Circle and the Circumference thereof. Both which Proprieties, and several
other tending to the mensuration and computation of the parts thereof, and
for manifesting the respect they bear to the Meridians or Parallels, or for de∣termining
of the respective Variation of the Longitude and Latitude which
it maketh in its Progress either way towards the North or South Poles, I
shall, in some following Lectures, demonstrate; whereby all such Disputes, as
have arisen about that Subject, will be remov'd, and the Nature and Pro∣prieties
thereof will be manifested by a much easier method of Demonstra∣tion
than what hath been hitherto by any one us'd or produc'd for that pur∣pose.
I shall also shew some other sorts of Projections of the Sphaere in <HI>Plano,</HI>
than have hitherto been produc'd, very apt and pertinent for this purpose,
whereby the Navigator may more easily, with his Ruler and Compasses,
measure the Rumb-line, and resolve all Questions that concern the sailing
by the said Line with as great certainty and exactness as is necessary to work
withal from any Observations or Mensurations that can be made at Sea by
the Logline and Compass.</P>
<P>But before I can well proceed with the explication of this Head, it will
be necessary to premise some Praecognita of practical Geometry, which will
be useful for the knowledge and more easy description of the Rumb-lines,
and for the measuring of the parts of them; especially by reason that the
Rumb-line as it is, or ought to be, describ'd upon the Globe, as it is very
difficult and almost impracticable to be made use of at Sea; so do I not find
that the said Lines are hitherto truly laid down upon any Globes yet extant,
or any certain way prescrib'd for the true drawing or laying down of the
same upon the Surface thereof, but they are set off by some Points from Tables
calculated for that purpose, and the interjacent parts of the Lines are fitted
up by hand and by guess, which is very imperfect and inartificial.</P>
<P>But by an Instrument that I ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e invented, it may be most exactly drawn,
not only upon the Surface of the Globe itself, but also upon several pro∣jections
of the Globe in <HI>Plano</HI> or upon a Plain, whereby not only the several
Proprieties of the said Line may be express'd, but also the mensuration of it
by the help of Ruler and Compass, will be more facile, expedite and tract∣able
for use, and the true Na<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of this perplex'd Line more easily compre∣hended
and conceiv'd: And this I do the rather, because I judge, that by
means of this way the true Course of the Ship may be more speedily, easily,
and with less subjection to mistake, be computed and protracted, than by re∣solving
of Triangles or Arithmetical Calculationt; for if by the Instrument
can be discover'd as small a part as one can be assur'd by the Log-line in
Sailing one Watch, then all nicety beyond that is loss of Labour and Time.</P>
<P>By Practical Geometry then I understand that part of Geometry, which
teaches an easy way of performing that by Operation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is here meant by practi¦cal Geometry.</NOTE> which is requir'd to
be done by Theory, in order to put it into effect and practise. The business
then of this Practical Geometry, is principally to describe, design and lay
down all those Things or Lines exactly, according to the Theory which are
requir'd to be done, and to determine and measure the quantities of the parts
desir'd by, or from that Description.</P>
<P><PB N="520" REF="499"/>
I know that into Practical Geometry, is usually also taken all the Business of
Observation, such as the taking or measuring of Angles, of Altitudes of the
Caelestial Bodies or Terrestrial, as Mountains, Clouds, and the like, and
the measuring of Sides or Angles upon the Earth in surveying; and the mea∣suring
of the Contents of solid Bodies, as Timber, Stones, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the
measuring of Liquors, or the capacity of containing Vessels, as is done in
Gauging, and other practical parts of Mathematicks; but these as not at all
pertinent to my present purpose, I shall now omit, and only confine my self
to speak of so much of Practical Geometry as serves to teach the true de∣scribing
and dividing of such Lines, Surfaces or Bodies as are, or may be
useful for this part of Mathematicks upon which I am discoursing, which is
of the Art of Navigation; namely, how any Probleme that is requir'd, or is
necessary for this Art, may, by the help of Ruler and Compasses, be truly
protracted and measur'd upon a Plain, with as great exactness as 'tis possible,
by the help of the Instruments and Methods that are hitherto us'd to make
Observation on which to ground the Calculation.</P>
<P>In this then I have four things to be consider'd, which makes up the Pytha∣gorick
Tetractys, namely, Point, Line, Superficies and Solid; of each of
which I shall discourse.</P>
<P>By Point then I do not here understand an imaginary nothing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is here meant by a Point.</NOTE> which, in
speculative Geometry, is defin'd to be a Negation of Quantity, or an Entity
that hath no Part or Quantity; but I understand such a Point as hath
Quantity and Extention, but yet so small and minute, as that the sense can∣not
distinguish that it hath any Parts; such as the Point of a very sharp Needle,
or the Point of a very curious pair of Compasses; or such a mark with Ink
as is made with a very sharp nibb'd Pen upon fine smooth Paper, which tho'
it may be easily enough prov'd, either by Microscopes and other Glasses and
by Reasons too to have breadth, and so both Longitude and Latitude, nay,
and Profundity too or thickness, yet as to the use, for which it is here de∣sign'd,
it is sufficient, and may pass for a true Mathematical Point, if at
least we will but suppose the middle of it to be that which is aimed at in
our Operation.</P>
<P>A Point is determin'd or given or found when the respects it hath to some
other Point or Points, Line or Lines that are also given and known, and are
sufficient to determine its true place., as if it be desir'd to find or place a
Point upon a plain Superficies that shall have the same distance from each of the
two other Points given that they have one from another: The Proprieties
can but agree with two Points in all that Plain, which two Points are one on
the one side, and the other on the opposite side of a Line drawn between the
two first Points given, and therefore the place of the Point is not determin'd
unless the said respect be also given.</P>
<P>But if a Circular Line be given, and it be desir'd to find or make a Point
which shall be equally distant from every part of that round Line, then is the
Position of that Point truely defin'd, and can be plac'd but in one place to
have that Respect or Propriety.</P>
<P>But further, if two Points be given in a Plain, and it be requir'd to find
or place another Point in that Plain that shall have this Propriety, that the
straight Lines drawn from the third Point to be found, shall make a right
Angle, or any other Angle at that third Point, then are the Data not suffi∣cient
to determine the Point, because there may be infinite of such Points
found, which will all fall in some part of a Circle which passes through those
two first Points; and to determine such Point it will be necessary either to
give the determinate distancc from one of those two first Points, or the An∣gle
that is made at one of them. Again, if from two such Points it be re∣quir'd
to find or place a third Point, whose distances from the first two shall
be to each other of any known or determin'd Proportion, as 2, to 3, or the
like; the Data are not sufficient to determine the third Point, because there
may be infinite of such Points, all which will fall either in a Circle or a
straight Line; and therefore there is some other Propriety requisite to de∣termine
the third Point to a certain Position. In the like manner I could in∣stance
a hundred other Cases, to shew the necessity there is of giving Pro∣prieties
<PB N="521" REF="500"/>
sufficient to determine the Position of any Point which is to be plac'd,
otherwise the Practise or performance thereof cannot be done. But I shall
not here further insist upon it, because that I shall discourse of it more fully in
the consideration of Lines, Superficies and Solids; and the only thing to be
observ'd in the placing of a Point, is to set it exactly in the crossing of two
Lines which are to determine its Position.</P>
<P>The next we are to consider is Lines; that is, not a length without bredth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Lines.</NOTE>
as in pure and speculative Geometry, but a length that hath the least sensible
bredth that can be describ'd, such as a Line drawn with the point of a very
sharp Needle, or point of a Compass, or fine nibb'd Pen, which may pass for
a length without bredth at least, if we consider the middle of it.</P>
<P>Now Lines may be either straight or bent; a straight Line is that which
is the shortest that can be drawn between two Points given, and consequent∣ly
there can be but one such drawn, and therefore that Line is perfectly gi∣ven,
which is so determin'd by two given Points, and therefore in speculative
Geometry, 'tis put for a <HI>Postulatum,</HI> that such a Line may be suppos'd drawn,
or is easy to be drawn; but in practical Geometry we must consider of the
means how to draw it actually, which in some cases is not so easily perform'd,
if extraordinary truth and exactness be requir'd: For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The difficulty of drawing a strait Line.</NOTE> First, if the Line be
to be drawn upon a plain, a straight Ruler being laid so as that the straight
edge of it just passes over the two Points, then moving along by that edge a
fine pointed Needle or sharp nibb'd Pen, we draw a line from the one Point to
the other, and for common use the thing is done; but if any thing of Niceness
or Curiosity be requir'd, we shall find it very difficult to lay the Ruler so as that
it equally respects the two Points, but that it will lie a little nearer one Point
than the other. Again, 'tis difficult to carry the Needle or Pen along with
the Hand, as always to keep the same respect to the side of the Ruler. And,
Thirdly, 'Twill be very difficult to find or provide a Ruler that is perfectly
straight, but that it will have some bending in it one way or other, be it
shot never so true with a Plain; for tho' the Plain be true that shooteth it,
yet if the Ruler be not secur'd from warping it will bend under the Plain;
besides, there are very few Plains that are so true, but that, if they are of
Wood, will, in a short time, have some little warping or bending; and I know
an ingenious Workman that assur'd me he could never shoot any thing true
'till he had made a Plain of Steel, which he had ground down to a truth of
smoothness and plainess by rubbing and polishing it upon another Plain, and
to have a true Plain to rub it upon, it is no easy matter to procure as I have
been sufficiently satisfy'd by such as have indeavour'd to have them for grind∣ing
of Optick or Perspective Glasses; for I could never yet meet with any one
but that, by a way I had to examine them, I have found them either a little
Concave, or a little Convex, tho' that were so little, as not, by the common
ways of examination, to be easily found. But it may be said, that streign∣ing
a fine Wire, or Hair, or fine Silken Clew between two Points, will de∣scribe
or draw a straight Line between two Points; to which I answer, that
if the Plain on which such a Line be to be drawn be exactly plain, and that
plain lie exactly Horizontal, then such a Wire or Hair will perform it; but
if the Plain be inclin'd or stand Perpendicular, and the two Points are not
Perpendicular one over the other, then such a Line can never be streign'd
strait whatever strength it be streign'd withal; for its own weight shall
make it bend down in the middle, as has been sufficiently demonstrated by
the ingenious <HI>Galileo,</HI> and <HI>Mersennus,</HI> and divers others; especially if there
be any considerable distance between the two Points. These things I mention
to shew, that tho' it be taken for granted, that this which seems the easi∣est
of all things in practical Geometry to be done, yet is not performable
without great difficulties where niceness and great exactness is requir'd:
And possibly this might be the reason why Geometricians will not allow such
Lines to be Geometrical, whose way of describing requires the sliding of a point
along by the straight side of such a Ruler as the Ellipse, and several other
Curve Lines, whose Proprieties are as exactly known and calculable as that
of the Circle, and this only granted may be as easily describ'd, and therefore
may as reasonably be suppos'd describable as the Circle or a straight Line.
<PB N="522" REF="501"/>
Since from what I have alledg'd 'tis evident, that it cannot be done exactly
without considerable difficulties; but if the two Points be very far distant,
it is almost impossible by any way to exhibit or draw such a Line; for not a∣gain,
to mention the bending of Rulers or Line, which 'tis impossible to pre∣vent,
even the sight itself, that is the Ray of Light, passing from Point to
Point through the Air, is not a strait Line as to its Position, by reason of the
differing Refraction which is in the <HI>Medium</HI> of the Air, which I my self have
very often prov'd by Observation, finding the same three Points which ap∣pear
at one time in a straight Line, at another time, sometime within half
an hour, have appear'd out of it very considerably, which I have very often
diligently remark'd.</P>
<P>I have been the more large and particular in shewing you the difficulties
that occur in the actual or practical performance of that which seemeth, and
is so suppos'd, the easiest sort of Line that can be drawn, that you may not
think it strange if hereafter when I shew you the way of drawing Rhomb∣lines
of several, sorts, and some other Curve-lines useful in Navigation, you
meet with some kind of Difficulties and Obstructions in the methods and
ways of describing and measuring of them, which yet I shall shew you as to the
true use that is to be made of them in Navigation, will be as sufficient as the
Circle or straight Line; but upon this I shall not now further insist, but pro∣ceed
In the next place to shew how on a given Line about a Point given, a
Circle may be describ'd; this, in Speculative Geometry, is a <HI>Postulatum</HI> and
suppos'd as easy and obvious to be done, and in small Circles on a Plain or
Table,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The difficulty of drawing Arches of great Circles.</NOTE> it is so by opening the Compasses to the length of the Line having set
one Point of the Compasses in the Point given, and with the other striking
round the Circumference 'till it return to the place where it began, by which
means a Circular Line may be describ'd much easier and more exact than a
straight, Line, or any other can be drawn. But for the describing greater
Circles the thing to be done is not so easy, nay, so difficult, that 'tis almost
impossible, especially where exactness is requir'd, as I was sufficiently sa∣tisfy'd
by the difficulties that occurr'd in striking a part of the Arch of a Cir∣cle
of sixty Foot Radius for the gage of a Tool for grinding Telescope Glas∣ses
of that length; whereby it was found that a Beam Compass made with all
Care and Circumspection imaginable, and us'd with as great Care, would not
perform the Operation nor the way by an Angular Compass, such as is de∣scrib'd
by <HI>Guido Vbaldus</HI> in his description of the Planisphere, and also by
<HI>Blagrave</HI> in his Mathematical Jewel, and several other Authors, there being
found so great a difficulty in making the edges of Rulers exactly smooth and
straight, as I did formerly mention, there being indeed no other practical
way of making such edges but the gaging of three such edges all true to
one another by rubbing and grinding, as there is hardly any other practi∣cal,
way of making the edge of a Ruler to be a part of a very large Arch
sit to be a gage for a Tool for grinding Telescope Glasses, then by grinding
and rubbing the edges of two such Rules together, the one whereof is Con∣vex
and the other Concave. The difficulties in this kind I do the more insist
upon here, because of the use of such parts of large Arches in the drawing
of the Projections of the Sphere, which the Work-men usually perform by
the help of a Steel Bow, which is bent less or more, as is desir'd, by means
of a Screw against the middle of it, the two ends of the said Bow being held by
the frame of the Instrument in which the Screw is also mov'd. But this In∣strument
as it is much more easy and applicable to this purpose, so is it far
less true and exact than the Angular Instruments. The true Figure of such a
Steel Lath for bending Circularly being not yet known, which I affirm not∣withstanding
what <HI>Marchetty</HI> in his Treatise <HI>de Resistentia Solidorum,</HI> has de∣monstrated
seemingly to the contrary; and if it were, and were exactly
made, yet those that have been conversant or experience'd in the Nature and
Use of Steel for Springs or bending, will quickly be satisfy'd how difficult a
matter it is to procure such a uniform peice of Steel, and how much harder
it is to temper it equally But I shall not insist further on this Matter at
present, having only mention'd what I have here alledg'd, to shew, that
tho' th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se two Lines which are the simplest and most easy to be drawn and
<PB N="523" REF="502"/>
describ'd are yet not of so easy performance in some Cases where great ex∣actness
is requisite, but that there is great care necessary in the preparing and
using Instruments fit for that purpose; and likewise to shew that if the same
care be taken in the providing and using of Instruments for describing the
Rhomb-lines, they may also be describ'd and drawn with the like certainty
and exactness, and be every way as fit for use and practise in business of Na∣vigation.</P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 19. 1685. I begun the last day to explain some part of Practical
Geometry, in order to reduce Mathematical Theories about Navigation in∣to
Use and Practise, and explain'd the ways and the difficulties also of draw∣ing
the simplest and plainest of all Lines, <HI>viz.</HI> the straight and the Circular
Lines whith are taken for granted in Speculative Geometry to be so easy to
be done, which notwithstanding, when there is requir'd great exactness in the
performance, are not so easy actually to be effected.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why specula∣tive Geometry puts some things as Po∣stulata that cannot be per∣formed.</NOTE>
It may therefore be in∣quir'd,
why then are they put as <HI>Postulata</HI> as if performable by any? To which
I answer, That the business of Speculative Geometry being only to demon∣strate
the propriety of such quantities, as Lines, Superficies and Solids from
their Definitions or Descriptions; it is sufficient to have only a right Con∣ception
of what is to be understood by those Appellations, and that they are
things possible to be done, or conceiv'd so to be, for grounding the Demon∣strations
thereupon, and that the actual drawing and delineating of them there,
is only to help the Imagination to conceive the notion of them aright. But
when we consider them in reference to Practical Geometry, we are to con∣sider,
not only that the things to be done are possible, but to teach the
Ways, Instruments and Operations how they may be actually perform'd,
and therefore 'tis not here enough to conceive, that there may be a right
Line drawn between two Points, or there may be a Circle describ'd about a
Point or Center at a distance given or determin'd, and then to demonstrate
by reason that those Lines must have such and such Proprieties; but we are
to draw them actually, and to shew by practise and actually doing, the thing
requir'd, and thereby to exhibit the thing done to Sense, which is one of the
ends and uses of Speculation. But it may be Objected by some, or at least
thought so; but what need is there of all this Curiosity, Preciseness and
Care of placing Points aright, and drawing Lines so curiously straight, and
of Circles so exactly round and true? To which I answer, that this is not
a needless Curiosity, nor so slight and insignificant a Matter as not to be re∣garded,
but a matter of great Use, nay, a thing of absolute Necessity; and
without which, all the real use of Practical Geometry, especially in Geogra∣phy,
Navigation and Astronomy, will be lame and imperfect: for all our
deductions and conclusions in these Arts are founded upon proper and true
Observations made; and all our Observations are made by the help of Instru∣ments;
and thence it will follow, that if our Instruments, us'd for such Ob∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervations,
be not exactly made and divided, our Observations cannot be
true, and if our Observations are not true, our Deductions from them will
not be true neither, but erroneous and false, and consequently all the rest of
our Labour and Care and Skill will be needless and insignificant: And that
this is so any one will easily grant, when he considers, that in most Instru∣ments
that are us'd for the Sea, which seldom exceed two Foot Radius, the
smallest Point almost that is sensible is the representation of a Minute, and
that Min<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te upon the Surface of the Earth, is no less than 6086;<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7/<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 <HI>English</HI>
Feet, there being found 365184 Feet in one Degree of the Earth, which a∣mounteth
to sixty nine Miles, and eight hundred sixty four Feet, or about <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
part, the Statute Mile containing 1760 Yards, or 880 Fathoms; so that
in the make of an Instrument of such a Radius, the error of the bredth of a
Needles Point in the placing the divisions of the Limb or the drawing the
Diagonal Lines or Circles, or the other parts of it, will easily make an er∣ror
of a Mile in Latitude upon the Face of the Earth, and much more in
Longitude.</P>
<P>And indeed considering the carelessness that is at present in the make of
the ordinary Sea Instruments made for Sale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The defect of the common Sea Instru∣ments.</NOTE> and several other Imperfections,
it is well if they can be certain to ten or twelve Minutes, that is, twelve or
<PB N="524" REF="503"/>
fourteen Miles. Now what signifies the resolving and calculating of Tri∣angles
to single minutes or lesser parts, when you are not sure by Observa∣tions
to ten. If therefore by the help of Instruments, such as a Planisphere,
a Sector and Compasses all Problems may be truly protracted and resolv'd
more exactly than the Observations can be made, on which they are ground∣ed,
what need will there be of more curious Calculations? But that this
may be done, I shall prove by the sequel of this Discourse, if at least due
care be taken in the materials making and dividing the Instruments, where∣by
I shall shew that it will not only be sufficiently accurate for all such uses;
but it will have this of advantage also, that whereas the other method by re∣solving
Triangles Arithmetically is done blindly and by wrought, and with∣out
a true Conception of the reason of those Operations; this will be done
more knowingly by protracting; since that alone will be sufficient to shew
the reason of the Operation, and to prevent a World of mistakes of one thing
for another very usual in the other way, since this way things are plac'd and
and measured in their proper places. This I thought necessary to acquaint
you with, that you might thereby see the great necessity and significant use
of such Niceness and Curiosity, as I mention'd to you the last Day, in find∣ing
and making the Points and drawing both the straight and circular Lines
true, and that such as may have occasion to make use of such Instruments,
or to make them themselves, as I hope some here may do, would be very
careful to see that they are made with sufficient exactness, and that the Ma∣terials
be such as may continue and preserve their form without warping or
shrinking. But on this Subject I shall say more hereafter when I treat of the
several Instruments themselves: I shall therefore at present proceed to the
other parts of Practical Geometry, and in the next place explain what is un∣derstood
by the respects that two right Lines drawn upon the same Plain,
bear to one another: This will fall under two general Heads; First, Such
as are equally distant from one another, and so call'd Parallels: Or, Second∣ly,
Such as some ways cross each other, and so form an Angle between them;
for an Angle is nothing else but the Respect, Tendency, or Inclination of
two Lines in the Point wherein they cut or cross each other.</P>
<P>This Inclination of two right Lines in the Point of Intersection is computed
by the part of the Arch of a Circle drawn about the Point of intersection as a
Center intercepted between those two Lines, and computed or compared with
the whole Circumference of that Circle; as if AB and DG cut each other
in the Point C,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 3. Tab. 10.</NOTE> and upon the Point be described the Circle FHKI; FE mea∣sures
the Angle FCE, for what part FE is of FHKIF, FCE is of four Right
Angles.</P>
<P>If the intercepted part be one quarter of the whole Circumference, then,
that Angle measured by it is call'd a Right Angle, and the Lines are call'd
Perpendiculars to each other; as if AB and HI crossing each other in the Point
C, FH be ¼ of the whole Circumference, then is HI Perpendicular to AB and
AB to HI.</P>
<P>If the intercepted part be less than a quarter of the whole, 'tis call'd an
Acute, as the Angle ECF or BCG, because FE or KG are each of them less
than a quarter of the Circumference, FCE and ECH making one quarter of
the Circle.</P>
<P>If the intercepted Arch be more than a quarter 'tis call'd an obtuse Angle,
as ECB or FCG, which are compounded of a Right Angle and an Acute, <HI>viz.</HI>
ECH and HCB, or FCI and ICG.</P>
<P>Hence 'tis obvious that Perpendiculars make four equal or right Angles a∣bout
a Point as FCH, HCB, BCI, ICF.</P>
<P>And that all other crossing Lines make two Acute and two Obtuse, which
four are equal to four right; and any two adjoining are equal to two Right
Angles as FCE and ECB are equal to FCH and HCB. So,</P>
<P>From hence proceeds the necessity of dividing and measuring the parts of
a Circle, and finding the proportion they bear to the whole Circumference;
which is various ways performed, the most usual and useful of which are per∣form'd
by the help and measure of straight Lines, which have certain respects
both as to lengths and position to some Diameter or Radius of the said Cir∣cle,
<PB N="525" REF="504"/>
of which I shall afterwards speak; such as are Chords, Sines, Tangents,
versed Sines or Darts.</P>
<P>A Diameter of a Circle is any straight line drawn through the Center,
and terminated at each end by the Circumference, as FB, HI, or EG.</P>
<P>And a Semidiameter, which is also call'd a Radius, is equal to half the
former, being any straight line drawn from the Center to the Circumference,
and terminated by them; as the half of any of the former line terminated
at one end by the Center C, as FC or CB, HC, CI, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>All Diameters of the same Circle are equal to one another, as are also all
Semidiameters or Radij, because every part of the same Circumference is e∣qually
distant from the Center.</P>
<P>If a straight line be drawn within the Circle cutting the Circumference
thereof in two Points, the part of the line intercepted between those two
Points is call'd a Chord or Subtense in similitude to the String of a Bow,
subtended or stretched from the ends thereof, as HG is the Chord of the Arch
HKG being extended between the ends of it H and G, and 'tis call'd the
Subtense or Chord of both those Arches or parts of the Circumference which
it divides or under which it is drawn; as of HKG, and of HFG. So a Dia∣meter
is always the Chord of a Semicircle.</P>
<P>All Chords that are equal subtend equal Arches of the same Circle, be∣cause
a Circle is a bent or curve Line, whose bending or curviture is every
where equal and uniform, every part thereof therefore which is equal in
length must have the same curviture, and consequently the same length of
a straight line extended or fubtended from its ends.</P>
<P>These Definitions or Descriptions will be enough for my present Use and
Discourse, I shall therefore proceed.</P>
<P>In Practical Geometry, as every regular line is drawn or described by some
proper Instrument; so every length is measured and every division also made
by some proper or known measure, by which the sensible truth thereof is e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣perimentally
verify'd and exhibited; I do not say demonstrated, as some I
perceive are very apt to do both in their Writings and Discourse, who
suppose the shewing a thing drawn upon Paper to be that which is under∣stood
by Demonstration; but that, I conceive, may proceed from a common,
tho' false Acceptation of that Word, since the strict and proper sense thereof is
much an other Notion, of which I formerly more largely discoursed: And
therefore I now take it for granted, that the Principles of Speculative Geo∣metry
are already known, and as such I shall refer to them where I have oc∣casion
to make ues of Demonstration; and shall not oblige my self to follow
the method of <HI>Euclid,</HI> but only treat of such parts of Practical Geometry as
relate to the Subject I have in hand.</P>
<P>Now because I shall only discourse of straight Lines and Circular, I have no
need at present to mention any other Instrument than a straight Rule and
Compasses, which are the most plain Instruments used, and so are sufficient∣ly
known so as not need any thing more to be said of them than what I
have already premised.</P>
<P>I need not also, I suppose, now mention the several ways how to draw or
let fall a Perpendicular from a Point given to a line given, nor how to raise a
Perpendicular from a Point in a line given to that line; nor how to divide a
line into two equal parts, these being sufficiently obvious and commonly e∣nough
known. And therefore taking these for granted as already known, I
proceed to other ways of dividing a line given into such a number, or such
sorts of parts as shall be required.</P>
<P>And First for dividing a given Line into any number of equal parts, the
way of proceeding is as followeth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of dividing a given Line. Tab. 10. Fig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4.</NOTE> Let AB be a line given to be divided in∣to
nine equal parts, First, Open your Compasses to the length of the line,
and having one point of them in A, describe the part of an Arch CB, then
from the Center B describe the Arch AD, then taking with your Com∣passes
the distance of any point in AD as D from the point A; set off the
same distance from B in he Arch BC to C. Then draw the lines ACE and
BDF, through the points AC and BD: Then opening your Compasses as
near as you can judge to the length of ninth part of the Line AB, the
<PB N="526" REF="505"/>
nearer you guess the better; and beginning at A, set off that length on AE
eight times, as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, then with the same opening of your
Compasses, beginning at B, set off the same length eight times on BF, as
g, h, i, k, l, m, n, o, lastly, laying the Rule on i and 0, 2 and n, draw the
several lines j 0, 2 n, 3 m, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> These parallel Lines shall divide the line AB
into nine equal parts as was desired in the Points p, q, r, s, t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the de∣monstration
of which is so easy that I shall not stay to insist upon it.</P>
<P>Next let it be required to divide a line given into all its aliquot parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To divide a line into all its aliquot parts.</NOTE> or
to give a series of parts which shall be reprocal to a series in Arithmetical
proportion, as, 1, ½, ⅓, ¼, ⅕, ⅙, 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>&amp;c</HI> in infinitum. The method of doing it
practically may be either of these three following ways.</P>
<P>Let AB be a line given to be divided into all its aliquot parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 11. Fig. 4.</NOTE> as ½, ⅓, ¼, at
one of its ends, as B; cross it with the Perpendicular KI, and produce it to∣wards
I, as far as there shall be occasion. Then taking any Point in the line
BK at pleasure as D, draw DC equal and parallel to AB and compleat the
Parallelogram AKDB. Then with your Compasses taking the length BD set
it off from B towards I, as many times as you disire aliquot parts, as BE, EF,
FG, GH, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> then laying the Rule on the Point C, and thoese other Points
E, F, G, H, successively draw straight lines which shall cut the line AB in
the points 2, 3, 4, 5, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the shall the line AB be thereby divided in as ma∣ny
aliquot Sections as shall be desir'd; for A2 shall be half of AB, A3, ⅓, A4
¼, A5 ⅕, and so onward so far as you will proceed; for since Dc is parallel
to AB, and equal to it the Triangles DEC, and BE2 shall be similar, and
DFC and BF3 are also similar; and DGC, likewise to BG4, and so onward in
infinitum. It follows therefore that as ED, 2, is to EB, 1, so CD = to AB, 1, to
B2 = to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, = A, 2, in like manner as FD, 3, is to FB2; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o CD, 1, to B, 3, ⅓, which
taken from AB leaves A3 = to ⅓, and so for all the rest, which is obvious
enough.</P>
<P>The same might have been thus demonstrated; AC being made equal and
parallel to BE, EF, FG, GH, the Angle CAB will be equal to ABE, there∣fore
the Triangle CA2 will be similar to EB2; and therefore as CA is to A2
in the Triangle CA2; so EB will be to B2 in the Triangle EB2; but CA
is put equal to EB, therefore A2 is equal to B2, therefore A2 = <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> AB. A∣gain,
for the same Reasons, CA3 will be similar to FB3, and consequently
CA. A3:: FB. B3; but FB is double CA, therefore B3 is double A3, there∣fore
A3=⅓ AB, and the same for all the rest.</P>
<P>Here in the practical performance of this Problem will appear the necessity
of that nicety and exactness I prescrib'd in drawing of straight lines curious
and true, and placing of the points precisely in the middle of the line and
of laying the exactly straight edge of the Rule over the very middle of the
Points, through which the lines, are to pass, and carrying the Needle or
Point with which you draw very equally and uniformly; for if all these par∣ticulars
be not carefully observ'd, and accordingly pracits'd and perform'd,
tho' the Problem be true in the Theory, yet the divisions made upon the
line AB, will be but imperfect and lame, especially if the line BJ be far pro∣duced,
and the repetitions of the equal parts be made some scores or some
hundreds of times, because the lines drawn from the point C through these
Divisions on the line BI produced, will be so oblique that a very little error
in any of those observables, will be apt to make an error of a whole division,
and so 'twill be difficult to distinguish for instance between a 99th part and a
100th part, moreover because the effecting of the Problem this way, if
the Reciprocals run far, will require the line BJ, to be drawn out to a
great length, and requireth as much room as the performing it by the Hy∣perbola,
which in many occasions cannot be so conveniently done, therefore
the same Problem may be effected by another way in a much less room and
with shorter Instruments, which therefore will be the less subject to warping,
and may be more carefully perfected.</P>
<P>The second way then of effecting this Problem is this:<NOTE PLACE="marg">d <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> Let AB be a line
given, all whose aliquot parts are desir'd as its ½, ⅓, ¼, ⅕, ⅙, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are re∣ciprocals
to a rank of numbers in Arithmetical progression, as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Upon the line AB make a Parallelogram Square or Rhombus ABCD,
<PB N="527" REF="506"/>
then draw the Diagonal AC. Now for finding the half, draw the Diagonal
DB crossing AC in E; though E draw FEG parallel to AD or CB, cutting
the line AB in G: Through D and G draw DHG cutting the Diagonal AC
in H; and through H draw IHK parallel to AD; then through D and K
draw DLK crossing the Diagonal AC in L; and through the Point L draw
MLN parallel to AD, and so proceeding so far as shall be needful or desir'd,
you shall find as many aliquot parts of AB as you shall desire; for as AB is
the whole, so AG is the half, AK the third, AN the fourth, and so you
may find the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and so onward as far as
you please. For First, the opposite sides of the Figure ABCD being equal
and parallel, the Diagonals must intersect each other in the middle, because
AED is similar to CEB, and therefore as AD is = CB, so AE = CE and
DE = BE. Next because the Triangles ABC and AGE are similar, as AE is
half AC, so AG = AB/2.</P>
<P>Secondly, AK is ½ of AB; for the Triangles AHG and DHC are similar,
because the opposite Angles at H are equal, and the alternate Angles at A and
C are equal, as also the other alternate Angles at D and G; therefore as DC
is to AG, which is as 2 to 1, so CH to AH, AH therefore is ⅓ of AC, and
because ABC and AKH are similar, therefore as AH is = AC/3, so AK = AB/3
The like Demonstration will serve for all the rest how far soever con∣tinued.</P>
<P>This Problem I have been the more particular in explaining for that I
shall have several occasions to make use of both in projections, and likewise
in the contrivances of several useful Instruments for Navigation, as parti∣cularly
in a way of sounding, the depths of the Sea in such places as Lines
will not reach, and in computing the way of a Ship through the Water, and
several other inventions, of which I shall speak hereafter.</P>
<P>Now because the drawing of parallel Lines so often as there are Divisions
made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 11. Fig 5.</NOTE> may seem somewhat troublesome, therefore I shall shew another way
how to effect this Problem without drawing parallel Lines; which is thus.
Let AB be a line given to be divided into all its aliquot parts. Through the
Points A and B draw right Lines parallel to each other, as CD and FE, whe∣ther
at Right Angles or not with the line AB it matters not. Set off on each
side of each of the Points A and B in the lines so drawn parallel a Point, as
C, D, E, F, of equal distance from the respective Points A and B. Then
draw CE, which shall cut AB in the Point G in half; the draw AE and DB,
which likewise intersect each other in half in H; then drew CH and Dg,
which shall intersect AB at I, making AI 1/3 of AB, and AE at K, making
AK 2/3 of AE; draw CK and DI, these shall intersect the lines AB and AE
at L and m, making AL 1/4 of AB and AM 2/4 of AE, and so proceed in infi∣nitum:
This will also give you all the aliquot parts of AB or AE. Or a Se∣ries
decreasing in reciprocal proportion to any Arithmetically increasing Se∣ries,
as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in infinitum. The Demonstration of which
Problem is much the same with that in the preceding Problem, and therefore
I shall not spend time in the repetition thereof.</P>
<P>And thus far I have proceeded to shew how any line given may be divided
into an infinite Series of Reciprocals to a Series in Arithmetical Progression,
of which sort I have only instanced in that Reciprocal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &amp;c.
but the same method will serve to give the Reciprocal to the Series that ex∣presses
the differences between square numbers of the prime Arithmetical
Series, as 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or any other such Arithmetical Progression, what∣soever
the common excess or difference be, as I could plainly demonstrate if
it were material to my present design, and may hereafter more at large up∣on
another Subject: but I shall now rather proceed to shew how any line given
may be divided into an infinite series of Parts in Geometrical Proportion
continually decreasing or increasing, according to any proportion whatever
assign'd, as 1, ½, ¼, ⅙, 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, 2/32, 1/64, and so onward in infinitum: Or, 1, ⅓, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>/<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7,
1/12, 1/43, and so onward to any proportional less then can be assign'd, and how
<PB N="528" REF="507"/>
to find the sum of such an infinite decreasing Series or a line equal to them,
all added together.</P>
<P>To effect which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 11. Fig. 6.</NOTE> let AB be a Line given to be divided into an infinite se∣ries
of Geometrical proportionals, according to any Ratio given; as sup∣pose
of 1000 to 999, or any other Ratio whatever; for instance, let it be
of 8 to 7 cross the line AB at the point or end A with another straight
line, as CAD, which may be drawn at Right Angles, or any other Angle
pretty near it, for the same effect will follow; then opening your Compasses
to any distance, but as near as you can guess to an eighth part of the length
of the Line CD, <HI>viz.</HI> according to the conveniences you may have of draw∣ing
or producing the said Line on the Plain or Table you are delineating up∣on
and setting one Foot in A, set off the same eighth part from A to C on
one side of the Point A; Then on the other side set off the saiddistance
AC seven times, <HI>viz.</HI> to D. Then draw from the Point C the Line CE par∣rallel
to AB, and from the Point B to draw BE parallel to AC, so as to com∣pleat
the Parallellogram or Rhombus ABEC; then through the Points
D and E, draw the Line DE, cutting the Line AB in F; through F draw
FG parallel to AC or BE; and through D and G draw DG cutting the
Line AB in H; through H draw HJ parallel to AC or BE, and draw DJ,
cutting AB in K; and through K draw KL parallel to AC, and so proceed
to draw DL, Mn, Dn, Op, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as far as you please. These Points F, H, K,
M, K, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> shall divide the Line AB into a series of Geometrical continued
proportionals in the Ratio of 8 to 7, as was describ'd or requir'd to be
done: For AB shall be to AF, as 8 to 7, AF. AI,:: 8. 7, and AH. AK
:: 8. 7, and so onward in infinitum, or as far as shall be requir'd; and not
only so, but the whole line AB shall be made up or compounded of an infi∣nite
series of continual proportionals, in proportion as 8 to 7, all which in∣finity
of proportionals being joined or added together into one line will be
equal to the line AB, and neither exceed it, nor be shorter than it.</P>
<P>Now that this division will be rightly done, will appear by the following
Demonstration is requir'd to be done; DC also being a straight Line touch∣ing
the Line AB in A; and DE being a straight Line cutting the Line AB
In F; the two Triangles DCE and DAF will be similar; and consequently
as DC to DA, which, by the construction, is made, is as 8 to 7, as was re∣quir'd;
so CE (which was put equal to AB) to AF. In the same manner
FG being drawn parallel to AC, CG and AF are equal, and the Line DG
being drawn cutting the remainder AF in H; he two Triangles DCG and
DAH are also similar, and consequently as DC to DA; so is CG (which
is equal to AF) to AH. Now DC to DA is put as 8 to 7, therefore also
AF to AH is as 8 to 7, as was requir'd: By the same Ratiocination, may all
the rest of the infinite proportionals be proved to be to one another, as 8 to
7, and consequently they will be all an infinite series of continued proporti∣onals,
decreasing infinitely in proportion as 8 to 7' which was the thing re∣quir'd.</P>
<P>Now since the whole Line AB, and the Ablata AF, AH, AK, AM, are
in continual proportion, as 8 to 7, as is prov'd the Reliqua BF, FH, HK,
KM, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> will be also in the same Geometrical continu'd proportion one to
another, as 8 to 7, as evident by the 17th of the 5th of <HI>Euclid,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>To express these Proportionals in Numbers is very difficult, but if this
Series he express'd Algebraical it will be easily perform'd; for putting the first
difference a, and the second, b, it will be this, a, b, bb 3b b4b b5/a a2 a3 a4 <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This method of finding and easily describing a Rank or Series of conti∣nual
proportionals, I have the rather chosen to explain and demonstrate by
this Problem, because by means hereof the true Nature of Logarithms and the
Logarithmick Line will the more plainly be understood and comprehended,
which by reason of the reservedness and design'd obscurity of most of those
who have written concerning the method of compounding and forming the
Logarithmick Tables, are not o obvious to every Reader; for in this present
<PB N="529" REF="508"/>
Problem, if the continual Proportionals BF, FH, HK, KM, MO, and all
the rest be put for the absolute Numbers: Then BE, BE—FG, BE—FG,
—HI. BE—FG,—HI—KL. will be the Logarithms to those Numbers, that
is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for Logarithms are nothing else but the Numbers
of the proportionals that are in the Series pitch'd upon, or made choice of
between any two absolute Numbers (or because a unite is the first and root of
all other Numbers) between one and any other absolute Number whatsoever.
And to that end in the making of Logarithms, because if the proportional
difference between the antecedent and the consequent be very great, it will
hardly fall out, that any of the proportional Sections will either fall in the
equal Section of the absolute Number exactly, or so near the same' as will be
sufficient to make the number of the proportional differences exact enough to
serve for the Logarithm; therefore the greater the number of those propor∣tionals
are between the unite and the other absolute number, the nearer will
the equal divisions of the interjacent space approach the proportional Secti∣ons
of the same; and by the increasing the numbers of the intermediate
proportionals, if the equal divisions do not <HI>coincidere</HI> with the proportionate
exactly, yet the approach may be made within any difference whatsoever re∣quired,
which is all that the nature of the thing, in some cases, will bear, they
being infinite and incommensurate; for the making of which Logarithmick
Numbers or Tables various ways have been made use of by several Authors,
some more easy in the Invention than others, yet they are all to the same
effect, tho' some of the Progressions are more accommodated for use than
others; as that of <HI>Mr. Briggs,</HI> where the Logarithm of one is, put a, 0,
and the Logaritthm of 10, 1 of 100. 2 of 1000. 3 of 10000. 4 with a cer∣tain
number of Cyphers after them, as <HI>Mr. Briggs</HI> puts 14. So that he sup∣poseth
One hundred Millions of Millions of proportional parts between
one and ten, and between 10 and 100, and between 100 and 1000, and so
onward in the Decimal progression; or between 1 and 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 and 1/100, and
1/<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>00, and 1/1000, of which in 100 Millions of Millions, there are thirty Mil∣lions
of Millions, One Hundred and Two Thousands, 999 Millions, 566
Thousands, 368 continual proportionals between one and two; and be∣cause
it would be impossible ever to enumerate and calculate all these, there∣fore
there have been various Expedients found to facilite this <HI>toedium</HI> of work∣ing
proportionals by Multiplications and Divisions, and extractions of the
Roots, and to perform the same thing for finding the Logarithms or the
number of proportionals in the series pitch'd upon, answering to each ab∣solute
number, by little more trouble than bare addition, which doth save
an infinite of trouble; and considering the great Use and Benefit of them in
solving many difficult and almost insolvable Questions of Geometry by any
other way, is a part of Geometry extreamly desirable to be thoroughly
known and understood, nevertheless it being not so much to my present pur∣pose,
and belonging more particularly to the business of Arithmetick, I
shall not further proceed in the explication thereof at present.</P>
<P>But rather proceed to the Explication of the Logarithmick Line, and
shew how it depends upon the Problem I have now explained, of dividing a
Line given into any infinite series of continual proportionals, because, as I
shall after prove, die same is the true Line of the Rumb in those projections
which I design to describe.</P>
<P>Let AB then in the second Figure represent the Radius,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 12. Fig. 1.</NOTE> BC a line at right
Angles with it, and equal to it the tangent of forty five Degrees, which is
to be divided into an infinite series of continual proportionals; so that BC
to BG shall be as any one number to any other number assigned. For in∣stance,
as 100000 to 99999, make Bd equal to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> part of AB, and
draw de parallel to BC; them make ds, st, tv, vx, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> each equal to dB, and
draw the lanes s, 1. t, 2. v, 3. x 4. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> parallel to BC. Then proceed to

the Line AB, shall represent the absolute numbers which are here a rank of
continual proportionals answering to the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, B or nought,
and Bd, Bs, Bt, Bv, Bx. The respective Logarithms to them increasing as the
absolute do decrease, according to <HI>Neiper</HI>'s method, or else BX, DX, SX,
TX, VX, X, or o, will represent the Logarithms decreasing as the absolute
decrease, according to Mr. <HI>Briggs</HI> and most others.</P>
<P>This Line which I have here described is not a true Curve Line, but a Line
compos'd of fragments or short pieces of straight Lines, <HI>viz.</HI> of the straight
Lines of cf, gh, ik, lm, no, pq, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are all Secants to the Radius bd
of the continual proportionals put as tangents, because fg, hi, kl, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are
all equal and parallel to it; and as AC the Secant of 45 is to AB; so fc to
fg = dB as Radius; so fi = gh, 12 = ik, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> so cfi 2, 3, 4, 5, is equal to the se∣veral
Secants Cf; gh, ik, lm, no, pq, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and supposing dB one infinite part
of AB, these fractures will be infinitely small, and so the Logarithmick Line
or Rhumb-line will be a true Curve Line compos'd of infinite of these infi∣nitely
small Secants.</P>
<P>From which Generation of this Curve Logarithmick or Rhumb-line, may
be deduc'd, First, That the Line AB being infinitely continu'd towards A,
shall be the Asymptot Line to the Logarithmick Curve cf, 1, 2, 3, 4, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
nearer and nearer, to which it shall always approach, but never touch it.</P>
<P>Secondly, That if from any Point of this Line infinitely continued either
way a perpendicular or ordinate to AB be drawn, and also a tangent, the di∣stance
between the ordinate and tangent intersection of the Asymptot shall
always be equal to the distance AB; from which propriety the mechanical
Description thereof, with great exactness and certainty, I shall prove to be
easy.</P>
<P>But because this Line may be various other ways describ'd also which will
also give light to the Nature of it; it may be conceived to be generated by
the composition of two differing kinds of motions crossing each other at
right Angles with differing tendency and velocities.</P>
<P>As supposing a Point or Atom at C, actuated by two equal tendencies or
velocities, the other towards W. Supposing the velocity towards C to re∣main
always the same, and uniform the motion or velocity towards W wil
continually increase so that when the Atom has past, for instance, 1/10 of
the distance between CW and AB, the velocity from BC towards AW will
he as 10/9 and at the end of the second space of time, as 1/8, of the third, as
10/7, of the fourth, as 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and so 10/2, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>/4, 10/3<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>/7, and 10, and so onwards in
infinitum.</P>
<P>If on the other side we suppose the tendency, velocity or motion from BC
towards AW, to be always equal and uniform, that is, in a certain space of
time, to move a space equal to one tenth of the length CB, then the motion or
velocity from CW towards AB, will decrease continually by an infinite series
of continual Proportionals, according to the differing velocities of the two
tendencies. These Proprieties I have not now time to demonstrate fully as
they ought, but shall reserve them to another opportunity.</P>
<P>THere being mention made at Page 524.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 12. Fig. 2.</NOTE> above, of an Instrument for drawing
Spirals or Rhumbs but not described I have here added a short description
of an In<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trument I remember he shewed the model of to the Royal Society with its
performance. Let there be made a thin flat Ruler a b c, having a slit through the
middle of it c d to slip freely upon a Center Pin fixt perpendicular in a plain, upon
which the Line is to be drawn: As the end of this Ruler c there must be cut a
round hole with a Ring of Brass exactly fitted to it, and in this Ring a small Truckle
Wheel with its Axis well fixt at right Angles: Then by moving this Ring in its So∣cket
in the Ruler, the plain of the Wheel may be set to any Angle with the slit in the
Ruler; which done, by moving the Ruler upon the Plain round the Center, the edge
of the said Truckle-wheel will describe, upon the Plain, the Spiral with the Angle re∣quired
at every revolution proportionally approaching the fixt Center. E is the Tru∣ckle-wheel
and Ring taken-out of its Socket in the Ruler.</P>

<P><HI>MAy 8th</HI> 1685. It is a Postulatum in Geometry, that 'tis possible or
practicable to draw or describe a Circle to any given Radius, and al∣so
from a Point given to any other Point to draw a straight Line; but tho'
in Speculative Geometry it be only to be understood, that a Circle of any
bigness may be conceived as drawn about a Center given, or a straight Line
may be conceived to be drawn between any two Points given; yet in Practi∣cal
Geometry where the <HI>Postulata</HI> are to be produc'd to effect and to be actual∣ly
executed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The difficulty of drawing a strait Line.</NOTE> if either of them are very large, the difficulties are greater
the every one will easily imagine, and neither the one nor the other can,
with any tolerable exactness, be perform'd. 'Tis true that a Line may be
extended and streined between two Points at a considesrable distance, and be
that Line may be said to be a straight Line as to its swarving laterally; but
as to its straightness in the Perpendicular Plain that passes through those two
Points, 'tis not in the power of Art to make it; for that the power of gra∣vity
acting on it will bend it into a Curve (which has of late Years much
excercised the Speculative Geometers to contemplate, they have given
it the name of the <HI>catenaria</HI>) but none have found any ways of describing it
otherwise than by Points, which are very troublesome and tedious, and at
best but imperfect (which yet shall shew how to do some other time) but I at
prefe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r only mention it by the by, to shew, that tho' a Line may be
strained between two Points, yet gravity will bend it from its straightness
and tho' tis Possible in great part to take off that gravity by a fluid, in which
the sai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Line shall be immers'd yet that for a great length will not obviate
the Objective. 'Tis true, if the Points be plac'd perpendicular one over an∣other,
a Line may be extended straight without any impediment from gra∣vity,
but then any motion of the Air, through which it passes, is apt to
bend it some ways or other, so that even that way is not free from Objecti∣ons.
And I found in my Observation of the Parallax of the Earth, that
there was very much trouble and difficulty to find the true Perpendicular
Point under the Center of the Object-glass, which yet with perseverance, I
conceive, I did at last attain. However some have propounded ways of
performing that Observation which have ten times the difficulty to execute
it to any tolerable satisfaction that was found in mine.</P>
<P>Now as this first <HI>Postulatum</HI> of actually drawing a straight Line between a∣ny
two Points has its difficulties,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> so the next of drawing a Circle to a Center
and Radius given, has many more, especially when the Radius is large. 'Tis
almost impossible to make a Beam for the Compass that is to describe it that
shall not bend and warp, and shrink and stretch in the using of it; and I re∣member
when Mr. <HI>Reeve</HI> was to make a Gage for a Tool to grind an Object-glass
for a Telescope of sixty Foot, after much Charge an Labour to per∣form
it, tho' all possible care and caution was imploy'd to effect it, yet after
all he was near a Month in Gaging his Tool before he could bring it to any
tolerable perfection, and even then he found it not to be of a Sphere of its
due length, but considerably less; which caus'd me to contrive a way how to
do it true at once with a much less aparatus, and that of as great a Sphere as
should be requir'd, as of six hundred as well as of sixty Foot, which I pub∣lish'd
in my Micographia in the Year 1664; but one <HI>Campani</HI> an <HI>Italian</HI> above
ten Years after publish'd the same thing as his own Invention, not taking any
notice of what I had done. I know Mr. <HI>Auzout</HI> Objected, that there were
some difficulties in adjusting the Machin, but I soon satisfy'd him that they
were all insignificant.</P>
<P><PB N="532" REF="511"/>
So that we see, that tho' Science can easily suppose and conceive things as
possible to be done, yet Art doth find many difficulties in the actual perfor∣mance
of them, and both ought to be call'd in for assistants in the prosecu∣tion
of experimental Philosophy: Wherefore there ought to be as much care
taken for the improving and perfecting of Art, as there is requir'd Sagacity
and Perspicacity in observing the effects and methods of Nature.</P>
<P>Now Nature in its Operations, is, for the most part, Regular, Constant,
Exact, Potent and Effective, and whatsoever is thereby design'd, it, accom∣modates
all things necessary to the performance thereof; it not only makes
the Materials of a proper Substance, but it shapes the parts of their due
Figure, and joins them in their due order, and actuates or moves them with
proper motions. But Art, which at best does but mimick Nature, must
search for materials where it can find them, and make use of such as can be
procur'd. These it must shape and fit for its purposes as the Matter will
indure, and as the Tools and Instruments, made use of, will perform, and
they must be join'd and compos'd together as other circumstances will per∣mit,
and actuated by uncertain, irregular and insufficient Powers. So that
at best the productions of Art in respect of those of Nature, are very much
inferior in perfection.</P>
<P>And yet they are of great significancy for the accommodating the producti∣ons
of Nature to the use of Mankind.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The benefits of Art.</NOTE> Thus Art doth form a Ship to pass
the Seas as big as the largest Fish, which it animates and directs with Men,
and makes the Wind to move and convey from Port to Port. Art doth
often also help and promote Natures Operations; as it improves the Sight
by Spectacles, Microscopes and Telescopes. It divides and measures the
parts and intervals of Time by Watches: It converts Corn into Bread by
separating the Husks and Bran by the Sive and Scarce, kneading the more
nutritive part into Dough, and last of all baking it in the Oven. And the
Fruit of the Vine it improves to a most pleasant Spirituous Liquour for drink.
We owe almost all our Accommodations of our Life to the productions of
Art. Nature puts us into the World more naked than most other of our
fellow Creatures; but Art has abundantly supply'd that Defect, by accom∣modating
the teguments of other Animals and Vegetables for that purpose.
Nay, Minerals also and Metals have been made subservient. I might in∣stance
also in infinite other accommodations and conveniences of Life. So
that tho' Art be far short of Nature in perfection of acting, yet since the
power of it is placed in Man, it seems to be of as great a concern to him
to be knowing and potent therein; for every new discovery therein gives
him a new Power which he had not before. Thus the discovery of the Mag∣netical
Needle inabl'd him to cross the Ocean and discover a New World;
and to incompass the Earth and converse with the remotest Inhabitants.
Thus the discovery of Telescopes inabled him to discover Caelestial Bodies
never so much as dreamt of before; and the Miscroscope has discover'd a
New World which was before wholly invisible. The discovery of the Pen∣dulum
has actually proved the inequality of the length of Days, and divid∣ed
the intervals of Time more exactly than the Sun.</P>
<P>The discovery of Gun-powder and Guns has chang'd the whole method of
offence, and defence both by Land and Sea. I might instance in many o∣ther
effects of Art to shew how much the Power of Man is increased by
them: but these are sufficient, and by these we may be inabled to judge of
their significancy when they are made use of as they ought.</P>
<P>By these also we may be sufficiently inform'd how much a new Discovery
or Observation may be considerable when duly apply'd, tho' in itself it seems
never so obvious, slight and common, as to instance in the Pendulum, or in
Printing, the grounds of which were sufficiently obvious to all, and there∣fore
slighted, whereas the due application of them has perform'd almost mi∣racles.
And there are other things as obvious as them, which being duly
apply'd, will be as effective tho' in another kind. An Experiment or Dis∣covery
is not therefore to be slighted, because, when it is shewn, it seems
easy, and obvious, and trivial, and because the consequences or uses thereof
are not presently detected.</P>
<P><PB N="533" REF="512"/>
What I some Weeks since propounded concerning the drawing of a Circle
true to a large Radius, I do very much doubt whether the best Mechanick, it
should be propounded to, would presently be able to effect it; which I am the
more inclin'd to believe from the Experimets I have seen try'd to that effect,
by the most accomplish'd Persons both for Science and Art; and yet when
discover'd, I doubt not but almost every one will be apt to say, he knew as
much; and yet I do not find that any one has mention'd it in their Writing.
<HI>Guidus Vbaldus</HI> and <HI>Stoffler</HI> have shewn a way of drawing a part of a Circle
of a large Radius by the help of two Rulers fix'd at a proper Angle, and
sliding against two Pinns at the extreamities of the Arch to be describ'd, which
is founded on a proposition of <HI>Euclid;</HI> but our Mathematical-Instrument-ma∣kers
seldom or never make use thereof, because of the difficulty of its use,
and imperfection of its performance; and tho' Mr. <HI>Reeve</HI> had procured one
made with great exactness, yet it did not perform its effects; but he made a
Beam compass of sixty Foot Radius, which did it not much better, by reason
of the warping at so great a length, which I conceive also Sir <HI>Chr. Wren</HI>
complain'd of in striking the Circle for the Dome at St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, tho', for
that effect, it were accurate enough. The Mathematical-Instrument-makers
instead of the Angular Rule make use of a Steel Bow, which they can,
by a Screw, bend more or less as they have occasion, and so can strike a small
Arch of a Curve, which, tho' not exact, is yet near enough to the Arch of
a Circle they have occasion to make upon their Instrument, and serves
well enough for common use in small Instruments; but where the Instru∣ments
are large and the Arches great, the irregularity may be discover'd;
and if a Planispherical<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> projection of a Sphere of twenty or thirty Foot Dia∣meter
were to be drawn, both these Inventions would be insignificant.</P>
<P>The contrivance which I shall at present describe is such as will perform
what is necessary for the describing a Circle of two hundred or three hundr∣ed
Foot of Diameter;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The method for drawing large Circles.</NOTE> which for most uses in making Instruments or Mapps
of the Planispherical Projection as large as any I have yet seen, or for strik∣ing
Gages for Glass Tools or Dishes larger than any have been yet made;
tho' for such Tools indeed, the method I have describ'd in my Micrography
is much better, because it doth at once, gage the Mould for casting, or the
Tool for working of the true Spherical Surface requir'd, whereas this only
making or describing a Line, the Mould and the Tool must be turn'd by that
Gage to make the Surface thereof, of the Sphere requir'd. But there are
other considerable uses of it as I shall shortly have occasion to shew.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday, May</HI> 16. The Royal Society met, I discours'd of my Instrument
to draw a great Circle, and produc'd an Instrument I had provided for that
purpose, and therewith, by the direction of a Wire about a hundred Foot
long, I shew'd how to draw a Circle of that Radius; which gave satisfaction;
the way was by a small Truckle-wheel fix'd in a thin Ruler, so that the Axis
of the Truckle kept parallel to the extended Wire Radius. Which Ruler
had two 'all Staples fix'd in it, through which the Wire could easily slip
to and fro. I explainsmd also to them the other way of fixing the Truckle at
the end of a small long Pipe of Brass that had a hole at the Center of each
end, through which holes that Wire was to pass that was extended from the
Center, and the same Truckle being always at right Angles with the Radi∣ant
Wire, and the Wire being free to slip to and fro in the holes, the edge
of the Truckle would describe the Arch of the Circle exact.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday May</HI> 22. 1695. I have the last Meetings indeavour'd to explain
the difficulties there are in making considerable discoveries either in Nature
or Art; and yet when they are discover'd they often seem so obvious and
plain to be understood or to be discover'd, that it seems to be more difficult
to give a satisfactory Reason why they were not sooner discover'd than how
they came to be detected now. How easy it was (we now think) to find out
a method of Printing of Letters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and yet except what may have hap∣pen'd
in <HI>China,</HI> there is no Specimen or History of any thing of that kind
done in this part of the World. How obvious was the vibration of Pendu∣lous
Bodies? And yet we do not find that it was made use of to divide the
spaces of time, 'till <HI>Galileo</HI> discover'd the Isochroness of its motions, and
<PB N="534" REF="513"/>
thought of that proper use for it. What I shew'd an Experiment of and ex∣plain'd
the last Meeting, may possibly be thought obvious and easy enough
to have been sooner thought of, by such as may have had occasion for its use,
and yet I never found the least mention made of it in any Author I have yet
met with. That contrivance will serve very well for describing a Circle of
two, three or four hundred Foot Diameter, and will describe it as exactly and
curiously as any small Beam Compass will do a Circle of two, three or four
Foot. But when it doth exceed a certain length, even that also will begin
to fail, and the difficulties will much increase; for that a Wire will be too
weak to bear a weight sufficient to strain it near enough to a straight; so
that there is in this way also a <HI>a non plus ultra,</HI> but <HI>est aliquid Prodire tenus;</HI>
this is much farther than could be done any other way; and by this way, if
a true plain be given, any part, or even a whole Circle may be discrib'd of
as great a Diameter as I have already mention'd.</P>
<P>But if a greater be yet necessary, Mechanicks do hitherto fail us, and
Nature also gives us none greater nor less than the Circumference of the
Earth, and that in the Surface of the Water, when the Air is Stagnant, or
without Wind, or in the Surface of such Water frozen into Ice. But this is
so great a Spherical Surface, that it can be of no Mechanical use that I yet
know of, unless it be to afford us a Plain large enough to describe a large
Circle upon, which is otherwise difficult enough to be procur'd. But when
we have procur'd such a Plain by the help of Nature in this manner by freez∣ing,
yet to duscribe a Circle of a thousand or two thousand Foot Diameter,
will be impossible by any way I have yet met with; and yet I think it not
beyond the power of Art, nay, tho' one of twice that magnitude were it
necessary.</P>
<P>And tho' it may be difficult enough to find a way before it be shewn, yet
when discover'd, every one will be ready enough to say, 'tis easy to do, and
that it was obvious to be thought of and invented; for that indeed every
one sees the Experiment of it daily, and yet no one has thought of applying
it to this purpose, as in the instance I just now mention'd of the Pendulum:
And that I may the more Plainly evidence this, I have prepar'd an apparatus
for the effecting thereof experimentally; which, tho' it be not a compleat
Instrument, such as I design to have made (when I can procure a proper
Workman at leisure) yet by this, and the demonstration of the truth of the
Grounds and Reasons thereof, it will be put out of doubt. This Apparatus,
and the demonstration, I will presently produce.</P>
<P>THe Author not having given any farther description of his way, and the Ap∣paratus
of performing it, I thought it might be acceptable to transcribe the
account of it as I found it enter'd in the Journal of the Royal Society as follows.
<HI>May</HI> 22. 1695. Dr. <HI>Hook</HI> produced and read an account of an Instrument for de∣scribing
a very great Circle, being, by the help of two rouling Circles or Truokles in
the two ends of a Rule, made so as to be turn'd in their Sockets to any assigned An∣gle,
thereby to become the two Tangents of any great Circle to be described; the in∣clination
of the plains of the two little rouling Circles being always equal to the An∣gle,
the length of the Ruler subtends to the Radius of the Circle proposed.</P>
<P>This is all I find concerning it; it were to be wisht there had been some draught
thereof preserved; but this way may be better apprehended by the next following.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>R. W.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P><HI>June</HI> 20. 1695. I have in my former Discourses or Lectures shewn some
new methods of describing the Arches of very large Circles, such as are very
hardly possible to be describ'd by any other way, at least not to that ex∣actness,
nor without almost infinitely more trouble and labour; and these
by Instruments easy enough to be made and used, and as easy to be under∣stood
and demonstrated, and those founded on Experiments and Practices so
universally known, that one would wonder how such an application as this
<PB N="535" REF="514"/>
should not be thought of by any one that had occasion for the use of it; and
this the rather, because we know it to be the reason on which is founded the
practice not ony of turning the Waggons, Coaches, and such other four
Wheel'd Carriages, but also of Boats, Lighters, Ships, and other Vessels;
as also Fishes for moving upon and through the Water, and of Hawks, Kites,
and other Birds which move through the Air. But we need not much won∣der
neither, when we consider at the same time how obvious the grounds of
the Art of Printing were by the use of Seales, and of rectifying Clocks by
the use of Pendulums, and yet how long the World was without those Arts
before they were thought of for those purposes and reduc'd to practice. The
true cause of which is the unwillingness that Men generally have to be at
the trouble of thinking and meditating, especially when they observe that
those that are so, do generally reap nothing for all their Labour, but either
Contempt, and the nicknames of Madmen and Projectors, or the Emulations
of others, which creates them continual troubles. Nor is there less difficul∣ty
in procuring the Instruments or Apparatus necessary to put a new Inven∣tion
into use and practice, than to invent and contrive the same; for Work∣men
are generally very unwilling to be put out of their common Road of work∣ing
and make a hundred Objections before they will undertake, and very
often make as many mistakes in the performing, before they will rightly exe∣cute
what is desir'd; and the inventer must be content not only to afford
them his patience, but his Purse also, otherwise no further progress is to be
expected, and often also, tho' both are supply'd, yet nothing will procure a∣ny
further trials; and new hands must be fought, where possibly the inven∣tor
speeds little better; but supposing him at last to have executed his de∣sign
and made his purchase, what has he got but some <HI>Difficiles Nugae,</HI> some
new <HI>Swing Swangs,</HI> which were the names that the Barometer for the Wea∣ther,
and the Pendulums for Clocks did a long time bear; but when Truth
at length doth prevail, and the usefulness of an Invention appears, then e∣very
one claims it for his own, tho' possibly he never had the thought of it,
'till all the World knew it. These may be some of the reasons why inven∣tions
have come so thin and seldom into the World: And why many parts
of useful Knowledge do yet remain undiscover'd; nor can we well expect
that they should be more frequent, 'till the allurements that should prompt
the Inquiry have another appearance. However, whether from the Genius
of these later Ages, or from the increase of Literature by the propagation
and communication of Knowledge by Printing, or from some other happy
influence from above; we have found that the present Age has been much
more fruitful in that kind than many preceeding, and we may hope that the
approaching may be yet more, if at least <HI>invenire discamus invienendo, ut Scri∣bendo
discimus scribere; Nam Res dat lumina Rebus.</HI> This was one cause why I
contriv'd the following addition to what I have already explain'd concerning
the methods of describing very large Circles. The first of which was how to
describe such a Circle about a Center given, and the length of the Radius, and
that of so great a length, that it is almost impossible for to make any Beam
Compass long enough to perform it without warping and bending, or any
string strong enough to do it without stretching and shrinking; all which in∣conveniences
I have thereby shew'd how to obviate most easily by making use
of one small Truckle put upon a Wire strain'd from such a Center to its Cir∣cumference.
The second way was how to describe a Circle, or any part of
it be the Radius almost never so great, and that without knowing or mak∣ing
any use of the Center, but only upon knowing the length of the Radius
or the desir'd Magnitude of such a Circle, or the Magnitude of the Subtense
of the Arch of a Degree, Minute or Second, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of such a Circle. Now
because there may be yet another condition desirable for some occasions,
which cannot be well perform'd by either of those methods, and yet may be
of necessary use for the solving of some Problems, or the actual execution of
some Designs; upon further contemplating this Subject I have contriv'd this
present Addition; and that is to draw the Arch of a Circle to a Center at a
considerable distance, where the Center cannot well be approach'd, or where,
by reason of incumbrances interjacent, a Wire cannot be extended; as from
<PB N="536" REF="515"/>
the top of a Pole let up in the midst of a Wood, or from the spindle of a
Vane at the top of a Tower in a City, or from a point on the other side of a
River, or in a Lake or Morass; in all which the Center cannot conveniently
be approach'd or come at otherwise than by the Sight. This Requisite then
I perform by the help of two Telescopes, so plac'd at the Truckles as there∣by
to see through both of them the same Point which is propos'd for the said
Center, and, by thus directing o them to such a Center, to set the Truckles
in their due posture, so as to describe by their motion any part of such a Cir∣cle
as shall be desir'd, whose Center shall be the point of the Pole or Spindle
mention'd. The qualification of the Instrument necessary for this Effect are,
First, That the Centers of the Truckles be exactly equi-distant from the
Center of the Compass; that is, that the Arms of the Compass be of
equal length. Secondly, That the plains of the edges of the Truckles do
exactly intersect in the Center of the Compass. Thirdly, That the two Te∣lescope

<Q>An Extract out of the <HI>Parisian</HI> Academies, Memoires relating to the al∣teration
of the Axis of the Earths motion, Read to the R. S. <HI>July</HI> the
third 1695.</Q>
<P>As there are some Inventions that are the Products of Design and Ratioci∣nation,
such as are acquir'd by the use of known Principles by the way of
reasoning, Application or Contrivance; so there are others found out by meer
chance upon Trials made for other purposes, as Gun-powder, the Magnetical
Vertue, Telescopes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But there is also a third sort of Inventions which may
be ascrib'd partly to the one, partly to the other, partly to Design and
Ratiocination, and partly also to Chance and Observation: Of this kind was
that of the cause of the Caelestial motions and of the Spheroidical form of the
Earth; of which I have long since discours'd, as also of the Parallax of the
fixt Stars, and likewise of the alteration of the Poles of the Earths diurnal
motion. Now tho' this Doctrine has hitherto met with great opposition on
the one Hand and contempt on the other, because the later part of the in∣vention
has not been compleated by some lucky chance to prove it positively,
by finding out some instances among the many Observations that are record∣ed
that might put it beyond dispute, nor by hitting upon a <HI>medium,</HI> by which
that might be verify'd in a short time; which, according to the known me∣thods
of Observations, require a very long one, yet I hope that a little time
will produce some such proof as will put it out of doubt; and if that does
not succeed according to my expectation, yet I hope I shall in some little
time be able to shew a way how to effect it. I am not displeas'd that Mon∣sieur
<HI>Cassini</HI> thinks it worth his inquiry, and I am apt to believe is conscious
of the truth of it, and that he begins to think of expedients how to solve
the Phaenomena when they shall be certainly found to concur with this Hy∣pothesis,
if he be not already convinc'd of it, and to be able to loose the in∣venter
of it by finding a great number of old pretenders to it. 'Tis true
that many have mention'd such a suspicion, and have indeavour'd to prove it,
but they seem to have grounded their Conjectures only upon experiments or
Observations made at several times in the same place, but not upon the The∣ory
of the causes of such a variation, whereas my Conjectures concerning it
were deduc'd from a Theory, which I conceive may be consonant to the pro∣cesses
of Nature; I know, indeed, that 'tis a very difficult matter to find out
such a Theory, and almost impossible to make it so evident as the Principles
of Geometry; for that the Nature, Composition, and internal Operations
and Powers of mixt Bodies are far beyond the reach of the Senses; nor will
<PB N="537" REF="516"/>
the Analogy hold between the motion of gross and sensible Bodies and those
of minute and insensible, as can plainly enough be prov'd.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The use of The∣ories.</NOTE> And upon that
account the <HI>Data,</HI> upon which the Ratiocination is founded, being uncertain
and only conjectural, the Conclusions or Deductions therefrom can at best,
be no other than probable; but still they become more and more probable,
as the Consequences deduc'd from them appear upon examinations by Trials
and design'd Observations to be confirm'd by Fact or Effect. So that the
Effect is that which consummates the demonstration of the Invention itself;
and the Theory is only an assistant to direct such an Inquisition, and by what
means to procure the demonstration of the Existence or non-existence there∣of.
Thus by my Theory I was led to believe that the body of <HI>Jupiter</HI> had a
motion upon its <HI>Axis,</HI> and thereupon I had a long time indeavour'd to dis∣cover
by my sight, whether it were really so as I suppos'd; but I could not
perceive it 'till I procur'd and made use of a very good Telescope, and there
was a Concurrence of a due position of the permanent Spot in <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and
a clearness of the Air, and possibly of my Eyes that assisted me in the Obser∣vation;
however therefore, tho' the Observation were the Demonstration,
yet the Theory was the occasion of seeking after it: And the same was that
discovery of the Parallax of the Earth, and of the Caelestial Motions, which
I have mention'd in my Discourse, Printed on that Subject. Now, tho' I do
not find that any have given themselves the trouble to repeat the Experi∣ments
and Observations necessary for that purpose; and tho' I think there
is no one that can find a real Objection against the way and method of ve∣rifying
it, which I made use of, yet there have not been wanting divers who
have so far taken notice of it as to suggest other ways of doing it, tho', I
conceive, much more troublesome, and abundantly more liable to Objection
than that which I contriv'd. But let every one take his own method (for
there may be many, but I believe it will be hard to find a better or so good)
provided they do actually make the discovery of the reality thereof; and I
am very apt to believe that the same has been verify'd in <HI>France</HI> and elsewhere
also by my way, tho' they seem unwilling to own it, and have not publish'd the
Fact; and that possibly may be, because they (that have made it) are un∣willing
to be thought to learn from others; and because I fear they cannot
find another way of their own that will be so good as mine. And this I am
inclin'd to think from a late Discourse Publish'd in the <HI>Memoires of the Parisian
Academy</HI> and elsewhere, by which they would have it be believ'd, that the
Well in the Observatory of <HI>Paris</HI> was made for that purpose before the pub∣lication
of my attempt, tho' 'twas two Years after I had made those Observa∣tions,
and read them to the Royal Society; and that Monsieur <HI>Cassini</HI> has
purposely made Observations of the Latitudes of Places to find whether
they do alter or not, and that thereupon he had detected such a variation of
the height of the Polar Star, which might serve to make him the discoverer
of the annual Parallax. The mode of the whole Discourse is somewhat
singular, which I have therefore extracted, to snew what methods are us'd by
some to raise Arguments against a truth they are unwilling to have known;
and the rather, because it is also somewhat a kin to Discourses for the same
purpose of our own <HI>English</HI> Manufacture.</P>
<P>“The irregularity of the Seasons of some late Years, and the frequent
<HI>Earthquakes</HI> which have happen'd in divers places has made some suspect a
change in the <HI>oeconomy</HI> of the World, and there have been some Astrono∣mers
who believ'd that there has been of late some considerable changes
of the height of the Pole. Mon. <HI>Cassini</HI> having been consulted on this affair
from divers places, has computed the present posture of the Heavens,
with the Observations he has made for above thirty Years, as also with
those of the most antient Astronomers, to see not only whether there has
been any change of late, but even for many past Ages.”</P>
<P>“The Antients took great care to compare the parts of the Heaven with
those of the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alteration of the Latitude of places.</NOTE> observing the Circles of the Heavens which corre∣sponded
with the Mountains, Promontorys, and other notable parts of
the Earth; and from time to time took notice whether these did alter:
'Twas not long before they found some. <HI>Eratosthenes</HI> about two Thousand
<PB N="538" REF="517"/>
Years since found by preceding Charts (as <HI>Strabo</HI> relates) that the Moun∣tains
plac'd on the East part of the Continent, had chang'd their Site,
declining more to the North, as had also the <HI>Indies.</HI> He corrects those,
and by a new Chart draws a parallel passing between <HI>Hercules</HI>'s <HI>Pillers,</HI> thro'e,
the <HI>Streights</HI> of <HI>Sicily,</HI> over the South extreams of <HI>Peloponesus,</HI> and con∣tinu'd
through <HI>Cilicia</HI> to the Gulph of <HI>Issus,</HI> and from thence to the <HI>Indies,</HI>
over the Mountain <HI>Taurus</HI> parting <HI>Asia</HI> into the North and South. These
in <HI>Ptolomy</HI>'s time, four hundred Years after, had changed places, <HI>Taurus</HI>
lying three Degrees more North than the <HI>Streights</HI> of <HI>Hercules.</HI> But if
the heights of the Pole in <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> now 1550 Years since, were exact,
the Poles are gone back and are come to the places where <HI>Erato sthenes</HI> found
them, <HI>Taurus</HI> and the <HI>Streights</HI> being both plac'd at 36°, but this parallel
runs two Degrees South of <HI>Sicily;</HI> and indeed the most part of the heights
the Pole, observ'd by the Antients, differ very much from those found at
present. If any could be rely'd on, those should be at <HI>Marseilles</HI> and <HI>Byzan∣tium;</HI>
the one made by <HI>Pytheas,</HI> and the other by <HI>Hipparchus,</HI> two of the
most famous Observators of their times. These were made by <HI>Gnom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI>
of great height, and at the Summer <HI>Solstice,</HI> well circumstantiated, and
with all the exactness Astronomy was then able to effect. Now if these
were exact, 'tis certain great alterations have happen'd since the times of
<HI>Hipparchus;</HI> for <HI>Hipparchus</HI> found <HI>Byzantium</HI> in the parallel <HI>Pyth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s</HI> had plac∣ed

it was remov'd seven whole Degrees. The Oriental Astronomers,
who liv'd divers Ages after <HI>Strabo,</HI> make <HI>Byzantium</HI> two Degrees mote
North than it was in <HI>Hipparchus</HI>'s times, as is plain by the Tables of <HI>Nasser
Edd<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r.</HI>▪ and Vlug <HI>Beg.”</HI></P>
<P>“But in this Age on the clean contrary, <HI>Marseilles</HI> is two whole Degrees
more North than <HI>Bizantium;</HI> for <HI>Cassini</HI> going on purpose to <HI>Marseilles</HI> in

its Latitude only 41°. 6<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. which agrees also with the Observations of Fa∣ther
<HI>Besnier,</HI> from all which, if suppos'd true, there must have happen'd
great changes.”</P>
<P>“The difference also between the Latitudes of divers places recorded by
<HI>Ptol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>my,</HI> and those observ'd in the same places by other Astronomers, since
may be argument enough for our Beleif, that the Pole has chang'd much
since the time of <HI>Ptolomy.</HI> This difference appear'd so convincing to <HI>Do∣minick
Mari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of <HI>Ferrara</HI> (a Man of an excellent <HI>Genius</HI> as <HI>Maginus,</HI> affirms,
and who was Tutor to <HI>Copern<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cus</HI>) that he asserted that the height of the
Pole did continually change, and that places now in the <HI>Torrid Zone,</HI> would,
in process of time, come into the Frigid and the contrary; and that the
Mountains of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> now roasted by the Sun, would in time be co∣vered
by Snow and Ice. <HI>Maginus</HI> also, and the Astronomers of his time,
affirm the Poles also to have changed. And <HI>Ticho</HI> was so far mov'd by this
Opinion, that he desir'd the State of <HI>Venice</HI> to send an able Astronomer
on purpose to see, if the present Latitude of <HI>Alexandria</HI> were the same that
<HI>Ptolomy</HI> had found it; but this without effect; however tis expected from
some, since sent for that purpose by the <HI>French</HI> King. 'Tis true, the ex∣actness
of anfient Observations was not to be compar'd to the Modern,
and therefore no more shall be said on that head at present.”</P>
<P>“But next to come to Observations less to be suspected, as made
this last Age. <HI>Rothman</HI> assures <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ho</HI> by a Letter, that he had found a dif∣ference
of the height of the Pole of a Minute or two, between the Win∣ter
and Summer of the same Year. <HI>Snellius</HI> and <HI>Ricciolus,</HI> who are both a∣gainst
this Opinion, do yet report Observations that confirm it, as that
<HI>Ticho</HI> observ'd the Latitude once 50°. 6'. another time 50°. 4'. 30'. such are
the Latitudes of <HI>Paris</HI> found by several Men, 48. 39'. [48. 45.] 48. 50. and
some 48. 55. Great differences are also found of the Latitude of the same
place taken at different times by <HI>Riccioli</HI> and <HI>Grimaldi</HI> with the greatest ex∣actness.
<HI>Grimaldi,</HI> in 1645, finds the Tower of <HI>Modena</HI> in 44°. 37'. ex∣actly,
<PB N="539" REF="518"/>
and the same <HI>Grimaldi</HI> with <HI>Riccioli</HI> in 1654, finds it 44. 38'. 50'. the
same found a place on the Mountain of <HI>Bolonia</HI> 44°. 27'. and the same
place another time 44. 27'. 50'. The same in 1646, found his Observatory
in <HI>Bolonia</HI> 44°. 29'. 30'. but in 1655, he, with <HI>Cassini,</HI> found it 44°. 30'. 20'.
the same says, <HI>Ferrara</HI> was once observ'd 44°. 50'. another time 44°. 51'.
7'. and <HI>Cassini</HI> another time since, by repeated Observations, found it 44°.
52'. In the Year fifty six <HI>Cassini</HI> found the Palace of <HI>Farnesi</HI> in <HI>Rome</HI> 41°.
52<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. but in sixty eight he found the Palace of <HI>Cardinal d'Este</HI> (which should
have been more) only 41°. 51'. At <HI>Paris</HI> 1668. <HI>Cassini</HI> and <HI>Picart</HI> found the
height of the Pole-star at the Kings Library 48. 53. and by that the height
of the Observatory must have been 48°. 51'. 10'. two Years after when
the Observatory was finish'd, <HI>i. e.</HI> in <HI>September</HI> 71. <HI>Cassini</HI> finds it 51°. 19'.
40'. and the twelfth of <HI>October</HI> following 51°. 19'. 50'. and the eighth of
<HI>September</HI> 51°. 19'. 10'. <HI>Picart</HI> at <HI>Vraniberg</HI> 1671. on the eighth of <HI>Octo∣ber</HI>
finds the greatest height of the Pole-star 58°. 23'. 15'. but in <HI>November</HI>
he finds it 58°. 22'. 55'. and in <HI>December</HI> 58°. 22'. 45'. He adds other in∣stances
of his own and other Observations too long to repeat at this time,
by which he seems to prove a change of the Latitude of Places, or the
height of the Pole even at the Observatory of <HI>Paris.</HI> But after all he pro∣ceeds thus—”.</P>
<P>“Notwithstanding all these Observations of apparent variations, it may
be said only, that in these later times there has happen'd no extraordi∣nary
change either in the height of the Pole or Meridian Altitudes of the
Sun; but also that the Heavens have at all times kept the same Position
to the Earth that they have at this present Age; since it may be believ'd
that all those variations, of which I have spoken, may have proceeded from
Defects in the Observations: As, First, From the defaults of Instru∣ments,
since it is certain that Instruments do suffer alterations from time
to time, the causes of which are imperceptible, which is the cause why
they are sometimes examin'd and corrected. Secondly, From the difficulty
of distinguishing the parts of a Minute. Thirdly, From the differing
Refraction of the Air, especially at the Observatory of <HI>Paris,</HI> being on the
South side of so great a City. Fourthly, As there is a variation of the
direction of the Magnetical Needle, so there may happen some change of
the direction of the Perpendiculars of Instruments, and these changes may
be more sen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ble in some places than in others. Lastly, As to the Observa∣tions,
of these the Antients were made with very course Instruments, they
had no regard of Refraction or Parallax or other Circumstances that might
cause Errors, and thence we need not wonder at such considerable differences
among them, besides the mistakes of Numerical Figures by the Transcribers;
so that maki<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> allowances for all these, there will remain little difference of
Position of the Heavens to the Earth, or the motions of the Stars to be
rely'd on, and it is more reasonable to ascribe those that are found to these
accidents than to a change in the Heavens.”</P>
<P>“And yet it is most probable that there is some small variation of the
height of the Pole which happens from time to time, but that never ex∣ceeds
two Minutes, and it will be settled in time. This is very remark∣able
in the height of the Pole of <HI>Alexandria.;</HI> for <HI>Ptolomy</HI> with all his
care found it sometimes 30<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 58'. at other times 31°; so tho' there be a
little change, yet this must not pass as extraordinary, since it exceeds not
two Minutes. The difference between those of <HI>Ticho</HI> and those of <HI>Picart,</HI>
in 71 and 72. is but 50. in 88 Years; and we must consider that this is
not in proportion, since we have found a greater change in one and the
same place in one Year. For twenty two Years now since the Observatory
has been built, <HI>Cassini</HI> has found but two variations: This variation the
said <HI>Cassini</HI> has attempted to reduce to some Rule; he fancies the Altitudes
of the Poles diminish as the Sun approaches the Aequinoctials and Solstices,
and increase as it departs from them.”</P>
<P>“Mr. <HI>Cassini</HI> also believes there is some change in the Solstitial Altitudes,
and has actually found them, but those not so great as those of the Pole;
and these variations he conceives, will in time settle also. We have al∣ready
<PB N="540" REF="519"/>
seen, that those of <HI>Pythias</HI> made at <HI>Marseilles</HI> three hundred Years
before Christ, and <HI>Cassini</HI>'s in 1672. differ but some Minutes, and we may
shortly expect, whether those sent by the. King on purpose to <HI>Alexandria,</HI>
will find any difference from <HI>Ptolomy</HI>'s Solistitial Altitudes.”</P>
<P>“It is of great importance in Astronomy to know to what preciseness the
height of the Pole can be found; for if we cannot with all our care, be sure
of it within half a Minute, 'tis in vain to make use of it for finding the
Parallax of Planets above the Moon, or for setling the hour of the Sol∣stice,
where some few Seconds are considerable; but indeed for <HI>Geogra∣phy,
Navigation,</HI> or <HI>Chorography,</HI> this is curious enough”.</P>
<P>What the design of this long Discourse of Mr. <HI>Cassini</HI> may be I cannot ga∣ther,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Authors Reflections.</NOTE>
unless it be to seem to deny the variation of the Altitude of the Pole,
because possibly he is oblig'd so to do, and yet at the same time exactly prove
it; or by a new way to solve the annual Parallax of the fixt Stars; which he
seems to grant, but yet 'tis by a new fancy of his own, for which I can con∣ceive
no reason. Me thought Monsieur <HI>Comiers</HI> was much more conceiv∣able,
tho' extravagant enough, that every Star mov'd in a little Epicicle o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
a Minute in Diameter, once round in a Year. Next I cannot but wonder to
find him at the same time relying on Observations of the Antients to prove
what he would have to be so and rejecting as far (and bespattering indeed all)
that are not for him; an easy way to prove or dispove any thing. Thirdly, I
observe, that tho' what I had formerly, spoken of the alteration of the Center
of the Gravitation of the Earth, were look'd upon as a very extravagant and
improbable Opinion, yet I conceive it is not so esteem'd by the <HI>Parisian Aca∣demians;</HI>
otherwise it would not have been Printed. I am also now apt to
suspect that <HI>Ticho Brahe</HI> did <HI>doulein Hypothesei;</HI> since, by <HI>Rothman</HI>'s, he was
advertis'd of such an annual Phaenomenon or Change, and that he might
easily have satisfy'd himself by his own Observations, without sending to <HI>Ae∣gypt</HI>
for information. To conclude, as Monsieur <HI>Cassini</HI> conceives these lit∣tle
variations or swayings of the Poles and Solstices will, in some short time,
settle and fix in their true places; so I conceive that all these struglings to
make it this or that, somewhat or nothing, more or less, will at last termi∣nate
in that Explication thereof, which I have long since propounded.</P>

For determining a Controversy much agitated now among the Learned,
whether the Position of the Meridians and Parallels on the Earths Surface
do really alter;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Difference of Meridians a∣mong the Mo∣derns.</NOTE> for that not only the present posture of them are found ve∣ry
different from those of the Antient Geographers; but differences are found
also among the more modern Observations, as the present Meridian of <HI>Vra∣neburg</HI>
<PB N="541" REF="520"/>
has been lately found by Monsieur <HI>Picart</HI> and others, to vary 18'. to∣wards
the East from that fixed by <HI>Ticho Brahe</HI> above a hundred Years since;
and the <HI>Pyramid</HI> of <HI>Egypt</HI> has been found newly to stand in a posture that
two sides of it respect the South. Now he having found that the Meridian
and Parallel of <HI>Bononia</HI> have not alter'd at <HI>Bononia</HI> in fourty Years, conceives
those other alterations, suppos'd to be found, are to be ascrib'd to the de∣fects
of the Observations themselves. In the next place he relates the first
occasion of making a Meridian Line in this Church of St. <HI>Petronio,</HI> to be for
rectifying the time of <HI>Easter,</HI> and the Feasts of the Church which depend on
the true time of the Vernal Aequinox. Now the Prelates of <HI>Alexandria</HI>
(who were deputed by the Council of <HI>Nice</HI> to state that time) found it then to
be on the twenty first of <HI>March;</HI> but Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> being inform'd, that it,
in this time, fell on the eleventh of that Month; he alter'd the <HI>Julian Ac∣count,</HI>
and made the eleventh to be the twenty first. This was the occasion
of <HI>Ignatio Dante</HI>'s first making a Meridian Line in the Pavement of that
Church in the Year 1575, before this alteration which was in 1683; but this
Line being found to vary from the present Meridian, and to be serviceable
only for observing the Solstices, and being suspected to be so misplaced by
reason of the obstruction of the Pillars of that Church was the occasion of
Monsieur <HI>Cassini</HI>'s finding a fitter place, and fixing there his new Meridian
Line in the Year 1655. the place where, and manner how he more parti∣cularly
and fully expresses, because it was of so considerable, and, as it
were, of sacred use to the Church: He names all the eminent Astronomers
who were his Concomitants in the Operations, as witnesses of the exactness
of it. After this he relates several variations that have happen'd to that
Fabrick since he first fixed this Line, and thereby shews the necessity and use
of the Restauration, and adjusting it for the time to come, by which any
further alteration that may happen to that Building for the future, may be
so far remedied, and the essential parts of this Line so far restor'd and recti∣fy'd,
that they shall be as effectual as if no alteration had happen'd. The
uses of which will be not only to shew the true time of the Suns ingross into
the Tropicks and Aequinoctial Points, but likewise into all the other Signs,
and so serve for the verifying or rectifying the Calender. The same being
now so plac'd as that the Perpendicular height of the hole by which the
Light is admitted (which is an Inch in Diameter) is a thousand Inches of the
<HI>Paris</HI> Foot above the Pavement and the Meridian Line which is as a tangent

<P>These considerations induc'd the Senators of <HI>Bononia</HI> who had the care of
the said Edifice committed to them to be at the charge to repair the said
Line, and to take care that it should be preserv'd for the future; to which
intent they not only caus'd the Instruments made use of in the fixing this
Line to be safely preserv'd, but they also desir'd <HI>D. Guilelmini</HI> to make so
good a description of them, that in case of decay it may be known how to
supply and make use of them for this purpose for the future; which
intention and desire the said Learned Professor hath fully perfected and com∣pleated
in his Discourse subjoined to that of Monsieur <HI>Cassini,</HI> and has like∣wise
added some useful Tables, as that of the parts of the Radius answering
to the divisions of the Tangent into Degrees, Minutes and Seconds. Second∣ly,
That of the Refractions and Parallaxes of the Sun at several Altitudes.
And, Thirdly, A Table of the Declination of every Point of the Ecliptick,
answering to the Minutes of Declination for the obliquity of the Ecliptick,

<P>That the Meridian Line which was fix'd by <HI>Dante,</HI> was not plac'd in the true
North and South Line, but did vary a little from it at first I can easily grant, by
reason of the Position of the Church and the Pillars thereof which would not sup∣ply
a fitting Room and Space for a more convenient Situation of it; and for
that I find the Author <HI>Dante</HI> to acknowledge as much in <HI>his Anemographia,</HI> Printed
1578. namely, that it did deflect a little towards the North-East; for that he
says, that the Sun, when it come to pass his Line, was a little fallen from its
Meridian Altitude; but whether the same did then respect the Meridian with
the same Inclination as now it is found to do; namely, with an inclination
of 9°. 6'. 20''. as <HI>Riccioli</HI> observ'd it, we have no Evidence; and I do very
much doubt whether we should have been acquainted with it if there had
been found a real variation; because the very imagination of such a variati∣on
was condemned in <HI>Galileo,</HI> who brought it as an Argument to prove the
motion of the Earth; who, as <HI>Riccioli</HI> words it, <HI>ex nimio Pruritu annuum mo∣tum

And such as are zealous to defend a Profession of their own, or receiv'd
Doctrine of the Religion they profess, or of the Church of which they are a
Member, are very unwilling to hear any Argument that shall be urged against
it; much less to produce or publish any new Argument or Evidence of their
own finding; however, 'tis very hard to suppose the noble <HI>Ticho Brahe</HI> to
have been so negligent or ignorant as to place it eighteen Minutes wrong,
and the variation observ'd by <HI>Guil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elmni</HI> of the Latitude of <HI>Bononia</HI> to be
different from that observ'd by Senr. <HI>Cassini,</HI> seem to argue somewhat for a
variation, But let Time determine this Controversy to Posterity, and every
one for the present satisfy himself as well as he can with what evidence he
can meet with: That there are as great mutations as these in the Globe of
the Earth, and of some of the other Globes I hope I shall be able some other
time to Prove.</P>

proportional Spiral upon a plain parallel to the Aequator, and consequently
the Rays from the Center being Meridians, are the true tangent Lines of
half the Angles from the Center, or of half the Degrees of the Comple∣ment
of the Latitude, and consequently the intersection of the Rumb-line
is easily found by the propriety of the proportional Spiral, equal differences
of Longitude dividing the said Meridian or Tangent Lines into continual
Proportionals; which continual Proportionals are easily found by the Lo∣garithms,
and by the Logarithms of the half Tangent Lines the Degrees of
the Complement of the Latitude are also found; and in a plain projection
upon a Cylinder, the division of the Meridians are made in proportion of
the Logarithm of the half Tangents of the Complements of the Latitude;
but if it be made by the projection beyond the Aequinoctial, then the Logar∣ithms

<DIV2>
<HEAD>Read before the Royal Society, <DATE>May 11th. 1687.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I mention'd, in some former Discourses, some ways of discovering the La∣tiudes
of places at Sea without knowing the Meridian, and without ta∣king
an Altitude, which were perform'd by the help of some true Projections
of the Caelestial Hemespheres, whereof the Polar Points were the Centers,
by finding and observing some remarkable Stars in some one Azymuth or
Perpendicular, and two other remarkable Stars in some other; and this to
be performed either when such Observations happened to be made both at
the same instant, or the one of them some known or noted time after the o∣ther.</P>
<P>The former of these two ways,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ways of find∣ing the Lati∣tude.</NOTE> which supposeth both the said Observati∣ons
to be made at the same instant, I shew'd by the Tangent Projection up∣pon
a Plain touching the Polar Point, or any other Point of the Sphere that
comprehended all the four Stars; the Zenith Point of the Place, and the Po∣lar
Point or Aequinoctial Circle, was very easily perform'd by the help of a
Ruler and Compasses, by drawing a straight Line cross the Projection with
black Lead, passing through two of them that were observ'd in one Azymuth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I do not re∣member<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n the Le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>
and then laying the Ruler over the other two that were observ'd in the o∣ther
Azymuth, and noting the Point where the said Ruler shall cut the for∣mer
Line drawn with black Lead upon the Projection; for that That Point
of Intersection will represent the true Point of the Heavens then in the
Zenith of the place where such Observation shall be made. Now by finding
the true distance of that Point of Intersection either from the Polar Point,
if it be comprehended in the Projection, or from the Aequinoctial Circle, if
that be comprehended, it will not be difficult to find the true Latitude of
the place; and, if it be desir'd, the Positions of those Azymuths and the
hour of the Night, and the true Meridian Line, and the like, which would
be too long to explain and exemplify at this time and place.</P>
<P>The former of these two kinds of Observations may also be perform'd by
the planispherical Projections, or the half Tangent Projections, where the
Polar Points are made the Center of the Projections more easily, or some∣what
more difficultly where any other Point of the Sphere is made the Cen∣ter
of the Projection; which is performed by drawing great Circles upon the
said Projections with black Lead which shall pass through each of the two
Stars observ'd in the one and the other Azymuth or Perpendicular; for
that the Point of Intersection of the two great Circles thus drawn, will
shew, upon the said Projection, the true Zenith Point of the place, whose
distance from the Polar Point of the said Projection (which is easily measur∣able)
will give the Complement of the Latitude of the place. The greatest
difficulty in this way, is the drawing of a great Circle upon the Projection,
which shall pass though the two Stars observ'd in the same Azymuth or
Perpendicular. But this, as it may be perform'd divers ways, some more
easy, some a little more difficult, some of which are Printed, and others
may if occasion require; so I think none so difficult, but that an ordinary
Capacity may, in a short space, be inform'd how to effect and perform the
same with accurateness enough. But the explaining these ways would be
too long for this present Meeting.</P>
<P><PB N="544" REF="523"/>
As for the second sort of Observations, wherein the two Azymuths are
observ'd at two differing times; that is, the second Observation of any two
noted Stars in some Azymuth is taken, some known or measur'd space of
time after the first hath been taken notice of: These may be made also
serviceable for the finding not only the Latitude of the place, but also of all
the other <HI>Postulata</HI> mention'd to be found by the former way, but with some∣what
more of Operation, and that not only by the Projections of the Sphere
made according to the Tangents, but also by those of the same made by
the half Tangents of distance from the Central Point thereof: And both
these may be divers ways effected upon the said Projections; but the most
easy, and that which is accommodated to both these kinds of Projections,
is by supposing that part of the Heavens to stand still, wherein the
first Observation was made, whilst the rest of the Heavens have pass'd on
their usual progress proportion'd to the interval of Time between the first
and second Observation; for by that means the two Azymuth-Circles both
passing through the Zenith of the place, both the straight Lines represent∣ing
them in the Tangent Projection cross each other in the Zenith Point, or
in a Point as far distant from the Pole of the Projection, as the Zenith of
the place is from the true Pole in the Heavens; and also the Circles in
the half Tangent Projection representing those great Circles of Azymuths
will cross each other in the Zenith Point at the later Observation.</P>
<P>To make this the more intelligible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 12. Fig. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> let <HI>R r, S s</HI> represent four notable
Stars truly plac'd in a Tangent Projection of a large part of the Northern
Hemisphere, whose Polar or Central Point let P represent.</P>
<P>Let <HI>R r,</HI> by Observation, be found to be in the same Azymuth or Per∣pendicular
one above the other at some time of the Night; lay a Rule over
those two Stars in the Projection, and draw the Line FA <HI>r R;</HI> this Line
therefore must represent the said Azymuth Line or great Circle in which is
the Zenith-Point at the time of Observation; which Zenith-Point we are
yet to seek and find out, because the great Circle that passeth through the
other two Stars <HI>s S,</HI> doth not cross the former now in the Zenith-point,
but in some other Point, as A at an unknown distance from it; but by watch∣ing
them they are found by some good Time-keeper, as a Pendulum-watch,
or the like, to measure the Time, and a convenient Instrument to find,
when they are in some one and the same Perpendicular, at two Hours after
the first Observation, to be in one Azymuth Line. Now, tho' not before, a
straight Line drawn through them, representing a great Circle, will also
be a true Azymuth Circle, and will pass through the Zenith-point of the
place at the time of the later Observation. Let a, n, g, represent the An∣gle
made at the Pole by the Heavens moving Westward in the space of two
Hours, <HI>viz.</HI> thirty Degrees. Suppose then the Azymuth Circle first taken,
<HI>viz.</HI> FA <HI>r R</HI> to stand still, and all the rest of the Heavens or the two Stars
<HI>S s</HI> to be mov'd forwards or Westwards thirty Degrees, and <HI>S s</HI> be now at
S s, draw the straight Line through them, <HI>viz.</HI> b S s, cutting the other FA
<HI>R r,</HI> not in A as at the time of the first Observation, but, at Z, I say; this
Point of Intersection Z, shall represent the true Zenith-Point of the place,
both in the first and last Observation; for APB is made equal to a n g, de∣noting
the interpos'd time, and P b s S is made equal to the Angle PA <HI>s S,</HI>
which shews their respects to the Pole in the later and first Observation.
Now <HI>FAR</HI> and b s S both passing through the Zenith, there can be no other
Point in them to represent the same, but where they cross each other, <HI>viz.</HI>
Z. Z therefore is the true Zenith Point, and its distance from the Polar Point
P being measur'd upon the Projection, will give the Complement of the
Latitude of the place.</P>
<P>The same thing may be perform'd upon the half-Tangent Projection, and
with more convenience, by reason of its great Capacity, and the less ine∣quality
of divisions: It hath only one Operation somewhat more difficult
than the other, and that is the drawing great Circles through the said Stars
instead of straight Lines in the preceding way; but in all things else the
Method and Demonstration is the same with that, and the Point of Inter∣section
<PB N="545" REF="524"/>
of the fixt Azymuth, and remov'd Azymuth is the Zenith-Point of
the place.</P>
<P>Now the ways of drawing a projected great Circle which shall pass thro'
two Points given of this kind of Projection, being many, and most of them
easy enough; I conceive this method of finding the Latitude of places may
be of very good use for Navigation, especially at such times, as, by reason
of Foggs or other Impediments (as the unknown declination of the place)
Altitudes cannot be so well observ'd or made use of at Sea.</P>
<P>But for the finding the exact Latitude of places upon the Land where
great Instruments may be us'd, I have other methods, not depending upon
the suppos'd true placing of the Stars, whereby that inquiry may be an∣swer'd
to what accurateness shall be desir'd, which will be of very good use
for that other question which I have propounded; that is, whether the La∣titude
of places alter and vary upon the Earth in process of time; and since,
if there should be any such, the variation is but small, and therefore very slow,
and the unaccurateness possibly of former Observations cannot much be de∣pended
upon; I conceive that by those ways it may be possible to resolve
that in a very few Years, which, by the commonly known methods, cannot
be expected in less than some Ages, which is the best way of redeeming
Time by making the best use of what we have yet to come.</P>
<Q>This Lecture, and the following, treat of the inequality of the Earths Mo∣tion,
and of the methods of observing and examining it.</Q>
<P><HI>May</HI> 25. 1687. It has been no small discouragement to my progress in
explicating some Phaenomena of Nature by some new Hypotheses, to find
that they have been misrepresented, or at least misunderstood or misconstru'd;
misrepresented I mean, when, First, I have been said to assert that absolute∣ly
and positively, which I only propounded as an Hypothesis, or as Queries
to be further examin'd by Reason, Experiments and Observations. And,
Secondly, When I have been represented, as affirming things which I never
did nor could have done with coherency to the Hypothesis; as that the
Earth hath been many times, besides in <HI>Noah</HI>'s Flood, all cover'd with Wa∣ter
and dry'd again: Misunderstood I mean, when the Arguments I pro∣duc'd
were not rightly consider'd and duly weighed, and that it seem'd indif∣ferent
to the Examiners to conceive of the matter as I had argued for it, or
the quite contrary: As to conceive that the Figure of the Earth may be ei∣ther
a prolated Sphaeroeid, or an oblong Sphaeroeid, or neither of these.
Misconstrued I mean, when that which I propounded for one end and use, is
wrested to quite another; as because I had doubted of the sufficiency and cer∣tainty
of the Astronomical Observations for this purpose, only for determin∣ing
whether the true Latitude of places, or their true Meridian Lines, had
varied, therefore I am represented as calling in question all History, both
Divine and Humane. These kinds of proceeding might have been expected
from a provoked Adversary; but why they come, whence they they do, I
know no reason. However, by the Sequel I doubt not but that even those
who shew the most prejudice, will make it evident by the benefit and use
they make of them, that there was no reason for such kind of treatment;
nor shall it deter me from proceding to propound some other Conjectures;
which, whether rightly propounded or not, I shall leave to further examina∣tions
by Experiments and Observations, as I did the former; all I desire
is a fair trial; let the Testimonies of Nature itself be examin'd, and their
Evidence not wrested nor bafled.</P>
<P>The thing I shall at present propound,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of an inequali∣ty of the Earths diurnal moti∣on</NOTE> is what I hinted in my attempt to
prove the motion of the Earth. <HI>Page</HI> the 27, <HI>Line</HI> the 31, 32, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I did
there hint, that I had then, in some of the foregoing Observations there
mention'd, discover'd some new motions even in the Earth itself, which
perhaps were not thought of before; one of which was this which follows,
which whether it were ascribable to this or any other cause, I will not con∣tend;
let trials more accurate and curious than possibly those first were may
determine it; I propounded it only as a query for examination. It is eighteen
<PB N="546" REF="525"/>
Years since I made the Observations, and they were made by a Clock which
went three Years without winding up more than once, which was the first
of that kind, where the weight of the Pendulum was very near as big as the
weight that kept it going for so long a time; whether the cause of the ine∣quality
were to be ascrib'd to the Clock, or the Earth, or some other un∣heeded
Circumstance, I will not now contend; yet I did, with what care I
then could, consider of all I could think of, and upon the whole conceived
them to be ascribable to some inequality in the motion of the Earth; but
let further trials determine it.</P>
<P>I conceiv'd then that there was some inequality in the diurnal Revolution of
the Earth, not such a one as <HI>Kepler</HI> supposeth, only of the Earth turning quicker
when nearer the Sun, and flower when further from it, but an inequality in
every Revolution; that is, that in one part of the Revolution it was slow∣er,
in another somewhat quicker; which, whether to ascribe it to the power
of the Sun, or that of the Moon, or both, let farther examination deter∣mine;
for there may possibly be causes, why both of them may effect it in its
diurnal Revolution. I do therefore propound as Queries, whether there
may not be in the Body of the Earth some parts which, tho' as to the gravi∣tating
powers of the Earth, may be duly situated and poised for its equal
Revolution upon its Axis, yet with respect to the gravitating Power of the
Sun or Moon may not be counterpois'd, but be over ballanc'd on one side of
its Axis.</P>
<P>I know that if the gravitating Power in the Sun and Moon be exactly the
same with that of the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That there may be a difference in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> the Query I propounded can have no ground;
but tho' they may in most particulars be consonant, as I shall prove in my
Theory of Gravity▪ yet there may be a cause (and there seems to be some
assignable) why there may be something Specifick in each of them, of that
kind Which I now propose, as may be possibly conceiv'd from the Moons Li∣bration,
of its turning or keeping pretty near the same side of its Body to
the Surface of the Earth. For tho' the supposing it to turn upon its Axis in
respect of the Sun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Moon <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ting and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>itution of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Body.</NOTE> so as to make a Revolution Isocrone to its Synodick Re∣volution
about the Earth, be an ingenious Hypothesis; yet the Physical Rea∣son
of such an equality seems pretty difficult to be conceiv'd, unless, we sup∣pose
some cause from the Constitution of the Body of the Moon itself, which
makes one part of it gravitate more towards the Center of the Earth than
another in such a Revolution. And if such there be (as I see yet no clear
reason to the contrary) then must▪ the unequal progresses of the Moon pro∣duce a
kind of Vibrating, Librating, or Pendulous motion thereof; so that
the equal motion suppos'd will be blended or compounded with a Pendulous
motion of that part towards the Center of the Earth. I will not presume
to a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ign what cause may be in the Body of the Moon; whether one side
of its body next the Earth be more de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se and solid, and the opposite more
porous and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>gy, or whether the one be constituted of Bodies more heavy
in Specie tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other, as that those parts which respect the Earth, should
be more of the Nature of Earth, Stone, Rocks or Minerals, and the oppo∣site▪
of Waters, Seas, Atmosphere, Air, of somewhat anologous to them;
which some appearances do seem to favour, and some others pu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>posely and
designedly contain'd and perform'd, may give us further information of▪
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon the whole it seems to me there is a necessity of some such supposi∣tion
to solve the Phaenom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>na hitherto taken notice of; and there may be a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of some other suppositions to solve some other Phaenomena which
I shall on another occasion mention. As to suppose that the Body of the
Moon, tho' it be Sphaerical as to its Circumference which happ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> in the Full
and Now Moon, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>clipses of the Sun, when view'd from the Earth, yet
that its Body may be in that Diameter of it which respects the Earth much
longer than in any other Diameter; that is, it may be of an oblong oval
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whose longest Diameter respects the Earth; whose Centers of Gra∣vity
tho' they are in the Axis, are yet not in the middle thereof, but nearer
towards the Earth. Now if there be such a diversty of the Body of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to the Earth, why may there not be some such in the Bo∣dy
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> respect to the Sun, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay tho it have a Revolution upon
<PB N="547" REF="526"/>
its own Axis?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the cause of the inequality of the Earths diurnal motion.</NOTE> For supposing the Earth suspended on its Axis of motion, if any
one part of that with respect to the Gravitation towards the Sun do more than
over-ballance the part opposite to it on the other side (tho' as to the Gravity
to the Earth they are ballanced) them must that part have a tendency to∣wards
the Center of the Sun, if at any time it be remov'd out of that Posi∣tion;
and that tendency must be Analogous to that of a single Pendulum (here
suspended) towards the Center of the Earth; so that when the motion of
Rotation is carrying it towards its lowest or direct Point, that power must
accelerate that motion, and when it hath pass'd that Point, and is beyond
it, that power must retard it according to the Degrees or Proportions by
which a vibrating Pendulum is accelerated, when mov<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d towards the Perpen∣dicular,
and retarded when mov'd from it; and this Acceleration and Re∣tardation
must intermix and blend itself with the equal Circular motion, and
Accelerate it in one part, and Retard it in another part of its Revolution;
as will be more conceivable by the Experiment I shall by and by shew with a
Wheel whose Axis lies Horizontal, and one of whose sides is somewhat heavier
than the other. Now, as I Conjecture or Query, whether there be not
some such Principle acting with respect to the Sun; so I do somewhat farther
query whether there be not some such Anomaly with respect to the Moon,
between which and the Earth there seems to be a much nearer kindred and
affinity than between that of the Earth and of the Sun; and possibly some∣what
of the Phaenomena of the change of the Sea by Titles and Currents, and
of the Air by Winds or Motions thereof may be found to be influenc'd by
such a Discovery.</P>
<P>What ever the event may be upon a strict examination by Experiments, I
conceive it will not be unacceptable, since it will be a truth in Physick ascer∣tain'd,
which will influence many other; and I know no other way of trying
it, than by that which gave me the first hint of it, which was the observing
the Velocities of several Stars at several times of the Night in their passing
by the Zenith, by comparing the several Arches they make in a certain space
of time with one another, and with the time exactly kept by a curious Pen∣dulum
Clock; for if we find that several Stars plac'd in or very near the
parallel of Declination which passeth over the Zenith in several parts there∣of
do all of them pass a certain Arch thereof when they transit the Zenith
in the same space of time exactly, then we may conclude that the dìurnal Ro∣tation
is euqal and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in a whole Revolution; but if it shall be found
that some of them pass an equal Arch in a longer, some in a shorter time;
(which was the Phaenomena I took notice of) them it will be further requisite
to prosecute such other Observations as may determine the Reasons and
Causes thereof, and farther Light will follow from it whatever way the Ex∣periment
shall determine it, provided they be carefully and accurately made
with accurate Clocks, and with Instruments fitted with Telescope Sights.</P>
<P>Now because the things to be observ'd, which are necessary to compleat
the Observation, are only two, namely, First, The length of an Arch
mov'd by a Caelestial Body▪ And, Secondly, the time wherein that Body
that moves such a determinate Arch; therefore I have contriv'd two In∣struments of sufficient accurateness in their respective kinds for performing these
Observations; and they are, First, A Telescope for the Sights of the first
Instrument for determining the parts of the parallel Circle, or Circle of De∣clination
in which the Caelestial Body moves. And, Secondly, A Pendulum
to measure and divide the time, during which the Body doth <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tually move
such an Arch.</P>
<P>As for the first,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for the Obser∣vation.</NOTE> namely, the Telescope, I have already sufficiently de∣scrib'd
it in my Discourse of a way for accurately finding the Meridian Line
and the Axis of the Earth, and therefore I shall not here need to repeat it.
<HI>Vide.</HI> p. 358. <HI>Supra.</HI></P>
<P>But for the second because of the curiosity of the Observation to be made
by it, I shall be somewhat more particular in its d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scription.</P>
<P>There are then three sorts of Pendulums,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pendulum for the Obser∣vation.</NOTE> which may be so adapted, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
that, by the help of them, the time between the transits of a Star over two
Meridians, at ten, twelve or fifteen Degrees distance may be measur'd to the
<PB N="548" REF="527"/>
fifteenth part of a second of time, if by the use of the Telescope Sight there be
occasion for so great exactness.</P>
<P>The contrivance of them all consists in these particulars; First, That they
all move during the whole interpos'd space by the first impress'd force when
they are first put into motion, without any addition of new force to continue
their motion, and by that means all irregularity, caus'd by the Wheel∣work,
is avoided.</P>
<P>Secondly, That they are all made with very heavy Weights, and of the
most proper Shapes for passing through the Air, so that they receive very
little Impediment from it, and much less of Irregular<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty by reason all extra∣neous
motion of the Air is kept off by the case in which they are included.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That their decrease of motion is regular and certain; so that
tho' their extream Excursions do approach nearer the Center or Perpendi∣cular,
yet that being always done in the fame proportion, the same number
of Vibrations will always be made in the same quantity of time; that is,
how many Vibrations, and what part over doth measure the time of an hour
at one time, so many and such part will measure the time of an hour at any
other time, whether of the fame Day or Night, or at times distant more
than a Day.</P>
<P>Fourthly, For that the motion of them is so adjusted, that be the Vibra∣tions
greater or less, they shall be all isocrone and of equal duration.</P>
<P>Fifthly, That the time of the motion through the whole length of one ex∣cursion,
whether longer or shorter, shall be actually divided into equal parts
by unequal divisions, but proportion'd so as to answer exactly to the given
Proportions or Divisions of time.</P>
<P>Sixthly, That they are all so contriv'd, that the observer shall be able to
mark the very moment of the last Transit himself, and the fame of the first
Transit by the help of an assistant; and this to as small a time as a humane
Moment, or as quick as Thought: So that he shall be able certainly to know
in what point or part of the excursion, the weight of the Pendulum is in,
when the Star is observ'd to be in the Zenith or Meridian of the place, or
in any other Meridian where the Stars there appearing does terminate and
finish the second Transit, or the end of the time to be observ'd.</P>
<P>This contrivance consists in two parts, First, To let go, or set in going,
the Pendulum by a touch of the Finger at the very moment of the first: Tran∣sit
of the Star to be observ'd, which hath this also of convenience or per∣fection
rather, that the Pendulum is always set in going, or beginning with
the same Arch of Descent, and not at an uncertain heighth. Secondly,
That with the like touch of the Finger at the moment of the second or last
Transit, there is a part of the Instrument that marks the very point of the
whole excursion, through which the Center of the moving Pendulum is at
that moment passing.</P>
<P>It may be perform'd with three sorts of Pendulums, namely, the Circular, the
Slope and the common Perpendicular Pendulum; each have their advantages
wherein they exceed the other two, and each their disadvantages wherein
they are exceeded by them; but upon ballancing the whole three I do most
approve of the last before either of the other, for the simplicity of its make
and thence its exactness and certainty of going; its Regularity in not loosing
its power and motion, but by Degrees very slow, which bear a proportion to
the number of Vibrations, and the regularity of its motion as to the divid∣ing
the Excursions into parts answering to equal Moments or Spaces, and
the easiness for letting go and also for taking notice of the last moment; all
which particulars I shall more particularly explain in the Module I shall pro∣duce,
which will much more intelligibly express it than a Draught or
Scheme.</P>
<P>WHat this Module was I never knew, but the ingenuous will easily apprehend
the contrivance and meaning of the Author without any Scheme, by consi∣dering
the following Paragraph; therefore I have not thought fit to trouble the Rea∣der
with a Conjectaral Draught of my own.</P>

<PB N="549" REF="528"/>
<P>As to the divisions of the parts of an Excursion, the whole length of the
Excursion on each side of the Perpendicular Point is to be made as the Ra∣dius
of a Circle of that length, and to be divided into a Line of Sines ans∣wering
to such Divisions of an Arch of a Circle, answering thereto, as shall
be convenient for the Division of the time of an Excursion; as if the whole
Excursion be perform'd in a Second of Time; then for Thirds the Semicir∣cle
is to be suppos'd divided into sixty equal Parts, and accordingly the Ra∣dius
into a Line of Sines answering to every three <HI>Degrees,</HI> which make thir∣ty
in the half, and sixty equal times in the whole Vibration; for the Veloci∣ties
in the Diameter being in proportion to the ordinate Sines, the times
will be as the Secants complement, and consequently as the parts of the
Arch.</P>
<P><HI>Wensday June</HI> 25. 1687. I shew'd here, at the last Meeting, one sort of In∣strument
for the measuring and dividing the parts of time to as great an ac∣curateness,
as I conceive, 'tis possible to be done by any kind of Mechanical
Invention whatsoever; for that it is capable of dividing and measuring it,
not only to the accurateness of the Thoughts of a Man, but, if need re∣quire,
even to Moments that are shorter some hundred times than humane
Moments. What I mean by humane Moments, I have formerly, in some of
these my Cutlerian Lectures explain'd to this Honourahle Auditory; and be∣cause
I find that sometimes the repetition of former Experiments and Obser∣vations
are not ungrateful to some,<NOTE PLACE="marg">At the end of the Lectures of Light.</NOTE> I shall now again shew that the Thoughts
of a Man move or change in a limited space of Time; not so quick but that
such moments are yet divisible into moments infinitely smaller or shorter of
duration, and thence that each humane moment is capable of Division into
any definite Number of Parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Minute divisions of Time.</NOTE> how many soever shall be assign'd; as if the
humane moments be as small as a third Minute of Time, which yet, I con∣ceive,
very few are able to distinguish by their Thoughts, yet that Third of
Time containeth sixty Fourth Minutes, and each Fourth containeth sixty
Fifths, and each fifth containeth sixty Sixth Minutes of Time, and so on∣wards,
which we find Astronomers will take notice of, and account for in
their Computations of equable Divisions, tho' they are in themselves but very
small and altogether insensible parts or one humane moment: I say insen∣sible,
by reason that they are quicker than the Thought of a Man can di∣stinguish
a Prior from a Posterior moment: For who is there that can di∣stinguish
the 3600 part of the Time of a Second, which yet is but a fourth
minute of Time? Much less will any one be able to distinguish the 216000
part, which is a fifth or a 12960000 part thereof, which is a sixth, and yet
we must acknowledge that such parts there really are included in every Se∣cond
minute of Time, tho' never so much smaller or shorter in duration than
a humane moment, and that they really have their Power and Effect in na∣tural
motions and alterations proportionable to such their duration, and are
measurable or conceivable there, tho' they are so much quicker than our
Thoughts and Abilities to distinguish one from another: For if we take for
a round Number that a Semidiameter of the Earth be four thousand Miles,
and thence find that the Circumference under the Aequinoctial Line be 25132
Miles, and 7412287183459, 10000000000000, which is 01290888208650
of a Mile in a Second of Time; or to omit the accurateness of the Fracti∣ons
and to keep to round Numbers, which, in this case, serve better where
the Matter and Design aim'd at is but Illustration, and to help Concepti∣on,
let us conceive that a part of the Earth, under the Aequinoctial, mov∣ing
in a Second of Time an 86400 part of that Circumference of the Earth;
which, to keep still to round Numbers, we may conceive to be near 1/10 of a
Mile, of 6000 Foot to each Mile; then will each part of the Earth there
move every Second of Time 1800 Foot, and in every Third of Time thirty
Foot, and in every Fourth of Time six Inches, and in every Fifth of Time
1/10 of an Inch. Now, tho' the Conception of this part of Time be really im∣possible,
otherwise than by Proportion and Analogy to the sensible parts, yet
the motion of Nature doth really measure it, and its progresses are adaequate
to such moments, and each fifth Minute of Time the part hath mov'd a
tenth of an Inch forward into another place, in respect of its Position to the
<PB N="550" REF="529"/>
Heavens, or to the parts of Space consider'd as immovable: And the pro∣gresses
of progressive or local motion being suppos'd equal or commensurate
to the moments of Time (how small soever) the Body must move in every
sixth Minute of Time, a six hundred part of an Inch forward; which length
our Senses can reach and distinguish, tho' it cannot the minim of Time,
which is not so to be magnify'd.</P>
<P>This Speculation I have been the more large upon, to shew that there may
be a use of this Instrument for distinguishing and numbering the parts of
Time, which are abundantly much less than a humane Moment; which, tho'
not distinguishable by our Thoughts, yet have their effects, in Nature, and,
in many Experiments, are very considerable and pertinent to be taken no∣tice
of; as I shew'd by many Experiments try'd before this Society above
twenty Years since, by an Instrument somewhat like this, for the measur∣ing
the times of falling Bodies, which possibly some here present may well
remember.</P>
<P>Tho', I say, these small moments of Time are not distinguishable by a
Man's Thought, yet by many Mechanical Contrivances they can be made
distinguishable, and thereby they can be made useful in multitudes of Physi∣cal
and Philosophical Inquiries, and even in this, which gave the occasion of
the mentioning of it; namely, the measuring of the exact time that any
Star that shall be observ'd, is moving from any one Position to any other; and
that even to a shorteror lesser time than that of one third Minute of an Hour,
which, if the motion of the Star be in, or near, a great Circle, is about a
quarter of a Second of a Degree. The way of effecting which, is the mak∣ing
the Telescope to move along with the Star, and when the Star is come
to a certain point, and consequently the Telescope that follows it, then doth
that Telescope let go the Pendulum, and set it going with a certain degree
of Velocity; and again, the same Telescope being kept moving along with
the Star, at least, some small time before it arrive at the second station;
then doth it, in its motion, let go the Stopper, or Stay of the Pendulum,
or Index thereof, just at the very moment as the Star is passing the Point
of the second Station; which denotes the precise moment of such Touch or
Transit. Now, tho' this be abundantly more quick than Thought, and so,
cannot be perform'd so nicely by the motion of the Finger, yet by this means
I speak of, where the Telescope is kept in motion with the Star, which is
easily enough perform'd, as I have often had Experience, the moments, tho'
exceeding small, will yet be numbred thereby. To this I could add the de∣scription
of a second Instrument, which is made with a Pendulum also, but
moving Circularly suspended by a round Steel Wire, and is to be let go, and
to be stay'd in the same manner, by means of the motion of a Telescope,
which follows the motion of the Star; in which Instrument the circulating
motion of the Pendoulus Weight doth describe a Spiral Line, which, by e∣qual
Angles from the Center, is divided into equal Spaces of Time, and
thereby the number of the Spaces in that Spiral, past by the Pendulum be∣tween
the two Transits of the Star, being computed, do give the exact num∣ber
of third Minutes of Time that have pass between the two Observati∣ons;
but this Instrument being somewhat more complicated than the former,
and that being sufficiently accurate for such trials, I shall omit the further de∣scription
thereof at this time.</P>
<P>And because I understood that the Demonstration I read of the true way
of dividing the Arch of its motion, into parts of equal duration, or of e∣qual
Time, was not so fully comprehended by some then present, which was
this I now read;</P>
<P>Therefore for a more full Demonstration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">These Schemes are l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st.</NOTE> and particular Explication there∣of,
I have drawn some Schemes, by the explaining of which I doubt not to
make it evident, in every particular thereof, to any one that shall doubt of
any part thereof, whereby the truth and certainty thereof will more plainly
appear.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 29. 1687. I spent some time in my last Lecture upon the considera∣tion
of sensible Time, and of the equal Division and Mensuration thereof;
for which purpose I explain'd two Instruments, the most exact that have been
<PB N="551" REF="530"/>
thought of, far exceeding, as I conceive, any that have been yet publickly
known, and capable of performing, or of helping to perform, such Obser∣vations
of Caelestial Bodies as no Istrument, yet made use of, has perform'd;
at least, not the bell that I had ever heard of; some Instances of which I
shall shortly acquaint you with; for tho' our Methodists have made compleat
Systems of Sciences, yet, when they come to be a little more nicely survey'd
by a doubting Examinant, many of those Maxims, that are so Dogmatically
and Positively asserted, will be found not altogether so Congrous to the truth
of Nature as they have hitherto been believ'd; and those none of the least
Considerable and Fundamental.</P>
<P>I could carry this Mechanism yet further, by shewing some Instruments
by which to measure the parts of insensible moments; I mean such moments
as a Man cannot distinguish by his Thoughts into a preceding and subse∣quent
moment, or is able to number or distinguish one from another by his
Eye or Ear, far less than that I call insensible; not but that the Sense doth
really distinguish moments, yet prodigiously less above a thousand times, nay,
ten thousand times, as I shall afterwards prove; but it is not under the Idea
of Time and Number, but under that of sound, Tone, Harmony, and the
like; wherein how curious the Sense of Hearing is, I appeal to such as are
skilful in Musick, who can easily, by their Ear, tell you when the Vibrati∣ons
of Musical Strings are one as quick again as the other, that is, when Di∣apasons,
when their Proportions are as 3 to 2, or as 3 to 4, or as 8 to 9,
that is, as a Diapente or Fifth, that is, a Diatesseron or Fourth, that is, a whole
Note or Tone, and the like, and when they are of such or such a determi∣nate
Tone, as <HI>Gam ut, A re, B mj,</HI> and the like, which they distinguish, I
say, by the Ear, or the Sense of Hearing, tho' not under the same Idea or
Phantom as they do when the Vibrations are so slow as to be singly distin∣guish'd
one from another, but under the Idea of Sound; which, when the
Vibrations are Isocrone, as I have formerly here prov'd those of strained or
extended Strings to be, which act upon the principle of Spring; as also Bells
or sounding Metals, and the Vibrations of the Air, which depend also upon
the Spring and Power or Recolle, they are Musical Sounds; but when they
are not Isocrone they are not Musical. In these cases the Sense runs a step
higher and brings us into another Region, where we find another prospect
of Time, and the Partitions thereof far differing from that of the first and
inferior Region, wherein we distinguish the parts of Time by Monades or
Unites; for in this we distinguish them by Aggregates, Bodies, Bulks,
Armies, Thousands, and the like great Numbers, not considering them
singly, but together; for this purpose I shall hereafter produce some Me∣chanical
Contrivances, by which these quick motions and minims of Time
may be reduc'd to Number and Computation, which I conceive absolutely
necessary in all Philosophical or Physical Experiments; but I shall not now
digress into Experiments of that kind, but proceed in that method which I
have begun, to shew the use of this Instrument I have already describ'd, and
shewn the Module thereof, by explaining how the same may be of use for
finding the Latitude of a Place without the incumbrance of Refraction, at
least by such a way as is the least of any I have yet known discover'd by any,
in Print, or any other ways.</P>
<P>This method I describe in order to the prosecution of that Inquiry which I
lately propos'd of examining, whether the Axis of the diurnal Rotation of
the Earth did, or doth change its Position in respect of the parts of the
Earth; that is, whether the Latitudes of Places do, in process of time, va∣ry
as well as the Meridian Line; for if the said Axis doth vary, one of these
two ways, or both, will be sufficient to discover it in any part of the Earth
whatsoever; for if such motion of the Axis as I have propounded shall hap∣pen
to move in the Meridian Line of the place where the Observation of the
Meridian, for that purpose, shall be made; then, tho' no such variation of
the Meridian Line can be, by that means, observ'd, there being none, yet
this way for examining the Latitude of the Place will soon detect it. Again,
if that motion should happen to be at right Angles to the Meridian of the
Place, then this way would be ineffectual, and the former way of finding
<PB N="552" REF="531"/>
the true Position of the Meridian Line, with respect to the known parts of
the Horizon, would perform it; and in case its motion be any other way in∣clin'd
to the Meridian, then the comparing of both these two ways together
will state and determine it, as it doth also in both the preceding Cases, be∣cause
it determines which way and how much in all.</P>
<P>It was necessary therefore that the way of finding the Latitude of a place
should be as accurate and as little liable to Objections,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 358. supra &amp; alibi.</NOTE> as the way I have al∣ready
shewn of finding the Meridian Line; which I conceive is the most ex∣act
that has been hitherto discover'd, and may be as easily made, and is suf∣ficient
to perform what is requisite in the Inquiry propos'd.</P>
<P>The method then for finding the Latitude of a Place, is by finding out the
true Zenith-Point of the Place where the Observation is to be made; how
to do this I have elsewhere shewn, and therefore shall not need here to re∣peat
it: This may be done to what accurateness shall be desir'd; for that
longer and longer Telescopes may be made use of for the determination
thereof; and it is not difficult to procure Object-glasses of any length de∣sir'd,
accurate enough for performing such Observations: Having deter∣min'd
that, I observe what Stars pass over the Zenith-Point, or pretty near
it, whose distance from that Point, in the Meridian, I can accurately mea∣sure;
then the following Night I observe that Star, I pitch upon, an Hour,
or an Hour and half, or some certain time before it come to the Zenith,
marking exactly the Point where I so observe it at the time I let go my Pen∣dulum
or Time-keeper, and measuring exactly the Angle that Ray maketh
with the Perpendicular, finding also, if I please, the position the Plain thro'
those two Lines hath to the Plain of the Meridian; tho' that may be omit∣ted,
when it is only us'd for finding the Latitude: Then I compute the Time
exactly that passes between such and such Observations, and the time it pas∣seth
the Zenith or Meridian; and at an equal time, after such Transit, I a∣gain
observe it on the other side of the Meridian, and find the Point or the
Angle that Ray also maketh. From the comparison of which two 'tis evi∣dent,
that the Declination of that Star is certainly determin'd, and conse∣quently
that the Latitude of the place, where such Observation is made, is
also given. Now the reason why I observe it on both sides of the Meridian
is this, because I thereby almost wholly avoid the Refraction of the
Air, and yet measure a large Arch; for that the Refraction of the
Air is hardly sensible even to Telescopes of so great a length, as may
be made use of for this Observation, when the distance from the Zenith
is not greater than what is requisite to determine this Inquiry, to what
accurateness almost shall be required, and the Observation on both sides
doubling the Angle at the Zenith, or the Arch of the Parallel, when it is
only made on one side, the Refraction, what it is, is still made more insen∣sible
when an equal subtense of an Arch of the said Parallel is obtain'd by Ob∣servation
on both sides, that when on one side only. This way of finding
the Latitude of a Place, I did, at the same time, formerly acquaint this So∣ciety
with, tho' not so particular, when I told them also the way of making
use of the Stars in the Perpendicular for finding the difference of Parallels
for measuring a Degree upon the Earth; but this part of the Contrivance I
do not find that the <HI>French</HI> have made any use of in their Observation of a
Degree, tho' they have of the other; possibly it might be, that he that ac∣quainted
them with the one, did not so well comprehend the other, and the
rather too, because the Invention of the measuring and determining the small
parts of time was not at the same time describ'd, but some of them before,
and some of them afterwards upon some other occasions; as that of the di∣rect
<HI>Pendulum</HI> upon the occasion of the Experiments of falling Bodies, and
that of the Circular Pendulum aequated by its motion in a Parabolical Cono∣eidal
Surface at another, tho' both these parts or inventions which were o∣mitted
by the <HI>French,</HI> have been Publish'd by Mr. <HI>Huygens</HI> as his own, in
his Book <HI>De Pendulo Oscillatioar</HI> many Years since.</P>

<P><HI>DEcember</HI> 3. 1690. As the Design of this <HI>Lecture</HI> was for the improve∣ment
of the History of Nature and of Art,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The increase of Knowledge like the growth of a Plant.</NOTE> so was the Institution of
this <HI>Honourable Society</HI> for the improvement of Natural Knowledge, which,
in other words, amounts to the same sense. This as it was at first (upon ve∣ry
mature deliberation, and with great Sagacity and Judgment) settled in a
suitable and proper method to attain the end; so, 'till better methods be
prov'd, it ought not to be alter'd and laid aside. The Design was for pro∣moting
the Growth and Increase, and Vegetation, as I may so call it, of
Natural Philosophy from the first Seed or Embrio through all the Ages and
Increasings of it, 'till it attain to a State of Perfection of Flowering and
Blooming, and of producing Seed, and become Fruitful; for Natural Know∣ledge
may not unfitly be compar'd to a Vegetable, whether Plant or Tree,
which springs from a Seed sow'd in a Soil, proper and adapted, by a skillful
Gardener, for that Plant. For as the Seed, by small Fibrills or Roots it shoots
out, receives, from the Soil or Earth, a nourishment proper and adapted for
ascending into the Body or Stalk, to make it grow in bulk and strength to
shoot upward, and from thence to shoot forth Branches, and from them
Leaves, thereby to draw and receive out of the Air a more refin'd, spiri∣tuous
and inlivening Juice, which descending back into the Body or Stock,
increases its Stature, Bulk, Circumference and Strength by new incirclings,
and thereby inables it to send forth more Fibrills and greater Roots, which
afford greater and more plentiful Supplies to the Stock or Trunk, and in∣ables
that to exert and shoot forth more Branchings, and greater numbers
of Leaves; which, repeating all the Effects and Operations by continu'd and
constant Circulations, at length bring the Plant to its full Stature and Per∣fection:
Nor will a skillful Gardener suffer it to be tapp'd to have the nutri∣tive
and vital Juice drawn off to be us'd for other purposes than the nutriti∣on
of its own Body; well knowing it would hinder its Growth, prolong the
time of its coming to Maturity, weaken its Constitution at least, if not
render it wholly barren.</P>
<P>So Natural Knowledge doth receive its first informations from the supplies
afforded by Select and proper <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Nature convey'd by the Senses;
these improve the Understanding and inable it to raise some Branchings out
into Conclusions, Corollarys and Maxims; these afford a nutritive and strength∣ening
Power to the Understanding, and inable it to put forth new Roots of In∣quisitions,
Trials, Observations and Experiments, and thereby to draw new
supplies of Informations; which further strengthening the Understanding, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣able
it to exert and produce new Deductions and new Axioms: These cir∣culate
and descend downwards, increasing and strengthening the Judgment,
and thereby inable it to make more striking out of Roots of Inquiries and Expe∣riments,
which cause the like Effects as before, but more powerfully, and so
by consent and continu'd Circulations from <HI>Phoenomena</HI> to make <HI>Deductions,</HI>
and from <HI>Deductions</HI> to inquire <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> it brings the Understanding to a
compleat and perfect comprehension of the Matter at first propos'd to be con∣sider'd;
nor must the Natural Course or Circulation be stopp'd or diverted,
'till the utmost Perfection be attain'd, if at least it be aim'd to compleat and
make it prolifique.</P>

It was a Conclusion by some such method as this produc'd by me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the differ∣ence of Gravi∣tation.</NOTE> and
made known to this Society near thirty Years since, that the <HI>Gravity</HI> of the
Earth was differing in differing Latitudes, and that it was greater under the
Poles than under the <HI>Aequator,</HI> and the nearer to the Poles the greater;
and the nearer the <HI>Aequator</HI> the less. This I first propounded to this Society
upon the occasion of the trials of the <HI>Pendulum</HI>-Clocks carry'd at Sea; and a∣gain,
upon the occasion of the <HI>Pendulum</HI> apply'd for a Standard Measure of
length, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But as things new and Heterodox to the Opinions in Vogue,
it met with a check, and so the further prosecution of it could not proceed,
I have many times since again repeated the Suggestion, sometimes upon one,
sometimes upon other occasions, but, as Extravagancies, they have been
pass'd over; the last time I repeated it Dr. <HI>Wallis</HI> wrote a long Epistle to
confound it, but Mr. <HI>Newton,</HI> it seems, upon examining it, found some rea∣son
for it, and sends up (a Fortnight after Dr. <HI>Wallis</HI>) his considerations up∣on
it, consonant to what I had demonstrated to the Society: This made it
begin to be taken notice of, and to be thought worth examining; however
many other Doctrines that were deduc'd from as evident premises have been
suffer'd to lie by, in expectation of a better opportunity, which I hope Time
may afford; which, when I meet with, I shall not be unmindful of laying
hold of; and I much rejoice at this which I have now met with of Captain
<HI>Knox</HI> his Voyage to <HI>India,</HI> who has promis'd to be very observant of it, and
to keep an account thereof; and in pursuance of the Order of this Society,
I have got a Pendulum Watch fitted for that purpose, which I now pro∣duce.</P>
<P>There is yet another Inquiry which will, if accurately tried with fit Instru∣ments,
afford great and useful Information, both for use at Land, and also
for the Sea and Navigation; and that is to find the Posture and Gravitation
of the Air. This I propounded to the Society as a thing very well worth
Trial and Examination some twenty five Years since; but as the use of the
<HI>Barometer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of a Sea B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ome∣ter.</NOTE> even at Land, was not then heeded, tho' I had then reduc'd it to
as much of Theory for foretelling the Weather, as is is known at this Day;
so the Inquiry, after the use of it at Sea, was the less regarded; and when af∣terwards
the thing came to be taken notice of by means of King <HI>Charles</HI> his
observing it to follow the Rules that were then set, which was about ten
Years after, many had thoughts of having it carry'd to Sea, but attempting
it only by the common way of the Barometer, not knowing, I suppose, the
way I had propos'd; the use of it at Sea was indeed impracticable, and, as
such, laid aside. I shall not trouble you with a new Description, but if you
please to afford me your Patience, I shall read the Description which I then
produc'd, and it hath ever since remain'd in your Registers.</P>
<P>The Contrivance of this Instrument is much the same with what I explain'd
to this Society about thirty Years since.</P>
<P>This being thus prepar'd will fully be sufficient to exhibit all the varieties of
Pressure in the Air; and 'tis capable of shewing all those Variations with as
great nicety and exactness as shall be requir'd even upon the Sea, tho' stormy
and turbulent: Nor is there any great difficulty of preparing or making use
of it; save only that, if the Gradations be requir'd to be very large, it will
require a very long Tube of Glass; and that Tube to be doubled or folded
to and fro to lie in a little room, which I have my self been able to do with
no great matter of trouble; but it would be yet much better if a very
long Tube of Glass, of forty or fifty Foot in length, were coiled round a
Cylinder, after the manner of Sir <HI>Christopher Wren</HI>'s Weather-glass; which,
with some few trials, I do not question may be effected; for that thereby it
would be easy to make the difference of Gravitation in the Air as large and
sensible, as it need to be desir'd; besides it will be, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But tho' it will not in those other Tubes, which I propose, be capable of
so great an Augmentation of that difference, yet these, if well adjusted,
will, I conceive, be found of great use for fore-shewing the approaches of
Storms and Calms, which extreams of the motion of the Air are very unwel∣come
and troublesome Concomitants at Sea. It will also give an account of
<PB N="555" REF="534"/>
the comparative Gravity of the Air in several Climates and Latitudes; and
thereby afford Indications, by which the Figure, Form, or Constitution of
the Shell of the Air, which incompasses the Earth, may be judg'd of. It
will likewise shew the Nature and Qualities of several Winds as to Pressure,
and also as to Heat and Cold; that is, whether an Easterly Wind be every
where the heaviest, and the Southern the lightest; as they are generally ob∣serv'd
to be in <HI>England.</HI> What Winds are hotter or Colder; that is, whe∣ther
Sea-Winds or Brizes, or Land-Winds or Brizes; whether there be any
certain difference between the Pressure in the Night and in the Day, as
there is constantly in the Heat and Cold; whether the Rains or the dry Sea∣sons
are the Hotter; and many others. And to this end it will be well to
note the state of this Instrument at Noon and Midnight, and in the Morn∣ing
and Evening.</P>
<P><HI>Decemb.</HI> 12. 1694. The Instrument I mention'd the last Day, which I had
about thirty Years since invented and shew'd to this Society, is, I conceive,
an Invention of so great use, that if the Knowledge and Practice of making,
adjusting and manner of observing with it, be once attained, it may be a
means of saving many thousands of Pounds in a Year to the Merchant, and
which is more, many hundreds of Mens Lives; and therefore I think it ought
not to be any longer neglected, but rather to be made and try'd as soon as
possible; and tho' we cannot as yet procure the means to make it of the most
perfect and most convenient form for transportation and use on Ship-board,
yet since it is easy and practicable enough to make it to shew all the dif∣fering
Pressures of the Air as exactly as the common single Barometer does
at Land, nay, twice as exact; I think it may be first try'd, of the perfectest
form we can now make it, and possibly that form may be most fit for the first
trial, since the other being more nice, may so much the more perplex the
unexperienc'd Mariner, and may better be introduc'd after the practice there∣of,
for the use of the Sea, hath made the Theory thereof more intelligible,
and the benefits thereof more sensible and evident.</P>
<P>The method and grounds of my Invention, I conceiv'd, were very plain and
obvious, as many others are after they are once discover'd and explain'd, and
some are then so obvious, that even that becomes the cause why they are
slighted, neglected, and not taken notice of; and possibly that may have
been one Reason why it has fared so with this, if being so easy to be con∣ceiv'd;
I did not therefore spend much time in the explication thereof; but
having the last Day apprehended, by some Discourses, that the Theory
thereof was not so perfectly comprehended, but that there remain'd some
hesitancy or doubts concerning it, I have now made a somewhat more parti∣cular
Description of the Instrument itself, and of the Ground and Reason of
the contrivance thereof.</P>
<P>It is now about sixty Years since the <HI>Thermometer</HI> was invented for the use
of indicating the degrees of Heat and Cold in the Air,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The History of the Thermome∣ter.</NOTE> by certain and deter∣min'd
measures, which was done by means of a bolt Head, or long necked
Glass, as they are now commonly call'd, the Ball or Head of which, and part
of the Neck, was fill'd with Air, but the Mouth or lower end was fill'd
with some colour'd Liquor, and immers'd in a small Cestern or Receptacle of
a quantity of the said Liquor; by which means the included Air, which is
rarify'd and expanded by Heat, and condens'd with Cold, did either de∣press
the said tinged Liquor into the Cestern, or draw it up higher into the
Neck, of the Glass; which property of the rarification and condensation of
the Air hath been known ever since the time of <HI>Hero,</HI> and probably long be∣fore;
yet the Application of that knowledge for this use, I do not find was
put into practice or taken any notice of, 'till about the Year 1630; some
short time after which I find <HI>Robertus de Fluctibus</HI> or <HI>Flud</HI> did write a parti∣cular
Treatise to explain the said Instrument and some uses of it; but <HI>Blan∣canus</HI>
ascribes the Invention of it to <HI>Sanctorius</HI> much about the same time;
but I will not dispute which of them we ought to ascribe it to; but who∣ever
it were, it was an ingenious Tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght, and adaequate enough to the
Theory of the Expansion of the Air then understood. But Experimental
Philosophy hath since made a further discovery, and shew'd us that the Air
<PB N="556" REF="535"/>
may not only be more or less expanded by the Degrees of Heat and Cold in
the Ambient Air, but also by the alteration of the pressure of the Atmos∣phere,
which doth less or more depress the Surface of the stagnant tinged Li∣quor
in the Cistern or Receptacle; so that That Instrument, commonly call'd
a Weather-glass, is no longer a true Standard to measure the Degree of Heat
and Cold, but serves only to give us the result of two Powers acting upon it
promiscuously; sometimes with a Concurrency both tending one way, and
sometimes with Contrariety and Opposition, the one promoting the Expan∣sion,
the other the Condensation thereof; if therefore we can by any means
discover the effects of the one at all times upon it, we presently find the
Power and Effects of the other. If therefore we can by other means discover
the Effects of Heat and Cold, we shall thereby discover what is to be ascrib'd
to the Gravity or Pressure of the Air.</P>
<P>Now to do this effectually I make use of the Sealed <HI>Thermometer</HI> which was
first invented, as I have been inform'd, by the Grand Duke of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> and
the first that I ever saw or heard of was a small one brought into <HI>England</HI> by
our Honourable President; by which I improv'd it by making several very
large, and tinged the Liquor to make it more sensible to the Eye. This In∣strument
being Hermetically seal'd, and so all the influence of the Pressure of
the Air being excluded, the included Liquor can only be acted upon by the
Heat and Cold of the Ambient Air; so that hereby at all times I am ascer∣tain'd
of the Degree of that quality; knowing then what the Power of that
quality is upon the Weather-glass, I can easily see what part of the Indicati∣on
is to be ascrib'd to the Pressure or Gravity of the Air or Atmosphere.</P>
<P>For this purpose having produc'd two convenient Glasses,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> method of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>king the In∣strument.</NOTE> the one for the
open Weather-glass, and the other for the seal'd <HI>Thermometer,</HI> by a Stand∣ard
<HI>Thermometer</HI> made and adjusted, according to the method I have pre∣scrib'd
in my Micrography, I adjust the <HI>Thermometer,</HI> putting all the Degrees
of Heat and Cold above and below the freezing Mark where I begin my
Account, or o, and making them with +1, +2, +3, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> above that mark; and
with −1,−2,−3, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> below the same, I wait 'till such time as the Barometer
stands at twenty nine and half Inches high, which is here in <HI>England,</HI> at least
the standard Altitude between Fowl and Fair Weather; then putting the Balls
of both the Glasses into Water heated to a certain Degree, which may be
hot enough to answer to the greatest Degree of heat that I conceive the Air
will sustain in any part of the Torrid Zone, I suffer them both together to
remain in that Degree of heat, 'till the Liquor in the <HI>Thermometer,</HI> and the
Air in the Weather-glass, be reduc'd to the same Degree of heat; then I
observe the mark'd Degree of the <HI>Thermometer,</HI> and mark the Weather-glass
with the same; then I permit the Liquor, in which the two Balls are plac'd,
to cool by degrees, and thereby observe how the liquor in the <HI>Thermometer,</HI>
and the Air in the Weather-glass, do contract by the motion of the Liquors
in their Stems, and by the Degrees of the <HI>Thermometer,</HI> I mark the Degrees
in the Weather-glass that answer thereunto; and when the Liquor is cold, I
intend that Cold, with Niter, and Ice to procure the Divisions below the freezing
mark; by which means I find all the marks of the Weather-glass that an∣swer
to all the marks of the <HI>Thermometer,</HI> when the Gravity of the Air is
equiponderant to twenty nine and half: Whenever therefore the Gravity of the
Air is more or less, I shall easily discover it by the difference there is be∣tween
the two Glasses; for that a greater Pressure will more condense the
included Air in the Weather-glass, and a lesser will suffer it to expand more
than it would have otherwise done by the Degrees only of Cold and Heat.
And by this method it will not be difficult to adjust two such Glasses as will
receive no manner of alteration from the motion of the Ship, and may be
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and easily carry'd and made use of in all parts of the World, to the
ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> most hot or extrea m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st cold, that can be indur'd by any one that is to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with them. For as there is no doubt to be made of the Experiment
of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rit of Wine seal'd in the <HI>Thermometer,</HI> so there is no fear of looseng
or freezing of the Quicksilver in the Weather-glass, if it be made after the
way that I have herein propos'd; the varying of which Instrument I have
<PB N="557" REF="536"/>
many ways contriv'd, and some other methods, if I can procure Glasses made,
I shall some other time acquaint the Society with.</P>
<P>As the Subject of my last Discourse was the Description of two several
Instruments that I conceiv'd would be of great benefit to Navigators and Na∣vigation
in general,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of a new Sea Quadrant.</NOTE> so I design in this Discourse to add the Description of a
third, which, I judge, will be much more advantageous, by reason of its fre∣quent,
nay constant, use and because so much of information concerning the
true Latitude of the place, where the Ship is, depends upon the exactness and
practicableness of it, I have propounded it by way of Query to divers very
skilful both in the Theory and Practice of Navigation; but (like things of
this Nature before they are known) they have all judg'd it to be impracti∣cable,
if not impossible, and yet I doubt not (when it comes to be known)
some of them may say, they knew as much as this before: Others possibly
may persist in the use of such Instruments, as they have been hitherto acquain∣ted
with, and others be offended at it because it is new; and yet I doubt
not but that, after some time, it may become of general use. The Instru∣ment which I shew'd the Society, some Years before the Sickness, by making
use of a Telescope-glass, instead of the small hole or slit of the Shadow-vane
of a Back-staff, was not made use of 'till about ten Years after, and yet now
it meets with general approbation, and is of continual use, and pretended to
be the invention of another, tho' my shewing thereof was Printed in the Hi∣story
of the Royal Society. It cannot well be expected that I should spend
my Time and Studies in inventing Instruments, and be at the expense of
making and putting in practice those which I have contriv'd, without re∣ceiving
any Benefit or Assistance from those to whom they may be of use, or
any other. It may, I conceive, be judg'd sufficient, by reasonable Men, for
the inventor to contrive and describe the Means and Ways how such as have
occasion, or desire of experimenting the thing, may, with ease enough, put
the same in practice; at least, if his Reward be consider'd, which, as the
Learned Author of the History of the Royal Society has observ'd, is com∣monly
ill Treatment, and not only rough Usage from those that envy his
acquists, but even from the Artificers themselves, for whose sake he has la∣bour'd;
whilst another that adds some small matter to it, is inrich'd thereby,
but the first discoverer it dismist with Contempt and Impoverishment.</P>
<P>The Instrument which was for a long time us'd for taking the Altitude of
the Sun at Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Instru∣ments now us'd.</NOTE> was an <HI>Astrolube,</HI> which is yet in use among the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as
I am inform'd; the Instrument is, by many Authors, very fully and sufficient∣ly
describ'd that it need not be here repeated, since that, the <HI>English, Dutch,</HI>
and <HI>French</HI> have made use of a <HI>Cross-staff, Back-staff,</HI> or <HI>Quadrant</HI> for that
purpose, as being found by Experience to be much more exact and certain,
and the adding of a Telescope-glass to the Sights, hath, as I mention'd be∣fore,
much improv'd both these qualifications; but they are yet liable to
some Inconveniences and Defects.</P>
<P>As, First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Defects.</NOTE> They are of little use in a dark Night, by reason of the diffi∣culty
of exactly seeing the Horizon.</P>
<P>Secondly, They are useless also in the Day time, if Foggs or Mists do hin∣der
the distinct discovery of the Horizontal Line.</P>
<P>Thirdly, They are uncertain when Refraction doth elevate or change the
true Horizon, which a certain vaporous Air, near the Surface of the Sea, doth
often cause.</P>
<P>Fourthly, They are useless when the Sun is in or pretty near the
Zenith.</P>
<P>Fifthly, They are troublesome and require great Dexterity and much
Practice to be us'd so as is necessary.</P>
<P>Sixthly, They can hardly be so well made or so well us'd, as to afford the
Observer a nearer certainty than about half a Degree.</P>
<P>All Which inconveniences I hope may be avoided by the Invention which I
have here made a Module of, in order to make it the more intelligible.
For,</P>
<P><PB N="558" REF="537"/>
First▪ It is as proper and as practicable to take the Altitudes of the Stars
in a dark but clear Night as in the Day, and that to as great exact∣ness;
tho' neither the Horizontal Line, nor any Stars near the Horizon, by
reason of Foggs or Clouds that darken them, can be discover'd.</P>
<P>Secondly, It is sufficient to take the Altitude of the Sun whenever it ap∣pears,
tho' the Horizon be not discoverable by reason of Foggs or Va∣pours.</P>
<P>Thirdly, It will be sufficient for the same purposes, whenever the Horizon∣tal
Line may be displac'd by Refraction, and thereby misguide the diligent
observer in the other way.</P>
<P>Fourthly, It will be sufficient to find the true height of the Sun, tho' ne∣ver
so near to the Zenith, and that with as much ease and certainty, as if it
were near the Horizon.</P>
<P>Fifthly, The use and practice of making Observations with this Instru∣ment,
I conceive to be no more difficult, than the easiest way of observing
with any of the Instruments now in use.</P>
<P>Sixthly, I conceive that Observations may be made with this Instrument,
much more accurate than 'tis possible to make with those now commonly
us'd; and as they may be made more exact, so the instrument itself doth af∣ford
a greater certainty, by reason that the Eye-glass doth make the Divi∣sions
as large and distinguishable, as if the Instrument, without that help,
were four times as large at least, nay, I can safely say, as if the Instrument
were ten times as large.</P>
<P>THe Author himself having given no Description or Draught of the above∣mention'd
Quadrant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 12. Fig. 5.</NOTE> I judg'd it would be acceptable to have some farther
account of it; wherefore finding a Rude Model of such an Instrument, I have here
attempted a Delineation and Description thereof, rather than it should be quite for∣gotten
and lost, tho' I am sensible that I have omitted several Particularities, which
if the Inventor had made the Description himself, would have render'd the Instru∣ment
more compleat and manageable; which Defect I hope same ingenious M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch ani∣cian
will at some time supply.</P>

the Eye-glass, is fixt into it at right Angles to the Quadrant. DE a Telescope mov∣ing
on the Center C upon the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> back of the Quadrant, on which also the Divisions of

C, of the Telescope, is placed a Reflecting-plate at an Angle of 45°. casting the I∣mage

between the Reflecting-plate and the Eye-glass, by which means the Object and Per∣pendicular
are seen in the Center at the same time, and so the true Altitude of the
Object taken, by fastning the Telescope on the divisions on the backside. GHIK an
hollow Cover over the Plumb-line, which serves also for an Handle for the Quadrant.
It may be likewise very convenient to have the Plumbet play in a small Vessel of
Water fastened to the lower end of the Handle at F, by which means the Plumber
will be less subject to vibrate far, by the opposition of a thicker medium than the
Air, which yet will not in the least hinder its Perpendicularity.</P>
<P>The preference of this Instrument consists in the taking the Angle from the Zenith,
rather than from the Horizon, which many times is not distinguishable, and always
subject to unnertainty from the difference of Refraction.</P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>There is another Instrument which will be of great use for discovering the
Latitude of places both by Sea and Land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of a Sea Tele∣scope.</NOTE> and that is a small Telescope;
whereby a skilful Navigator, or any other ingenious Person, may easily dis∣cover
the Eclipses that happen of the <HI>Satellites</HI> of <HI>Jupiter</HI> upon the Sea; the
use the which Eclipses, as <HI>Galileo</HI> did first mention, so have they been by ma∣ny
Persons approv'd of for that purpose, and several have indeavour'd, by
Observations, to perfect the Theory of them, as <HI>Hodierna, Borelli,</HI> Mr. <HI>Rooke</HI>
of this Society and Colledge, and now lately the <HI>French</HI> King'ds Astronomer
Monsieur <HI>Cassim,</HI> and a very curious discovery has been made by Monsieur
<HI>Romer</HI> the <HI>Dane,</HI> which is generally now approv'd of by knowing Astrono∣mers,
<PB N="559" REF="538"/>
tho' Monsieur <HI>Cassini</HI> (possibly because the Invention of a Tramontane)
seems to hesitate concerning the certainty of it. Mr. <HI>Hally</HI> also has lately in∣deavour'd
to facilitate the use of Monsieur <HI>Cassini's</HI> Tables for calculating the
true times of them, which, I conceive, he may yet make more easy for vul∣gar
Capacities, such as many of the Seamen are, who will have occasion for
the use of them. But such difficulties, I confess, will be easily remov'd by
Ephemerides, purposely calculated by some skillful Astronomer, and Pub∣lish'd
in a Sheet of Paper for seven or ten Years before hand, which Mr.
<HI>Hally</HI> can easily perform; but yet they will be of no great use for the Sea,
'till such time as they are supply'd also with convenient Instruments for the
Observation of them, which, I hope I may have the freedom and opportu∣nity
to communicate in some short time, and should have done it long since,
if I had not been discourag'd by undeserv'd Troubles. But I see it to be the
general Fate of all such as make any new discoveries, and therefore bear it
with more patience; however I do not doubt but that the humour of Man∣kind,
in that particular, has stifled the Productions of many useful Disco∣veries.</P>
<P>Certain it is, that the invention of Telescopes is not yet brought to its
greatest Perfection, no nor of Microscopes neither, tho' Mr. <HI>Leuwenhook</HI>
seems to have some of greater Perfection than ordinary; but I doubt not
but that I shall be able to shew, that both the Telescope and the Microscope
may be easily enough advanc'd to much higher degrees of Perfection than
what have been hitherto produc'd. It is not very long since the invention of
Convex Eye-glasses was found out for seeing a larger Area of the Object;
which, tho' it do not, I confess, make the Object more distinct, yet is it of
great use in Caelestial Observations, especially at Sea for the easy finding
and retaining of the Object in the Telescope, which, in Telescopes, with
Concave Eye-glasses, is extreamly troublesome, even in the shortest, and
much more in long ones; however this seems not to have been found out
'till about the time that <HI>Reita</HI> Publish'd his Book call'd <HI>Oculus Enochi &amp; Eliae,</HI>
i. e. about the Year 1645. for perusing that Author in Sir <HI>Ch. Scarborough's
Auction</HI> I accidentally met with two places, wherein he has, in a secret Cha∣racter,
communicated some Secrets about the making and use of Glasses,
which seem to have been unknown to the World at that time: These, as
finding little else considerable in it, I transcrib'd, and having since deciphred
them, I find them to comprehend these words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reita's S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ts deciphered.</NOTE> <HI>Chartam patinae lenissimo pul∣mento
ingeniose agglutina tripoli vitrum polito in ea.</HI> This seems to be much
the same way which Mr. <HI>Marshal</HI> did here shew this Honourable Society,
tho' what he apply'd it unto for Polishing many Glasses at once, is an addi∣tion
of his own, of which he says he took the hint from what I did Publish
in the Preface of my Micrographia, concerning the Polishing of many Object∣glasses
at once for Microscopes. This Aenigma of <HI>de Reita</HI> is to be seen in
Page 344 of his Book, now mention'd in these Characters.</P>

<P><PB N="560" REF="539"/>
This it seems was then a secret, tho' now generally known and made use
of for Day Objects, and that even in short Lengths; but for the Caelestial
Observations where there is not great need of erecting the Object, one or
two Eye-glasses is much more convenient; for that they may be made to take
in a much larger Area, and represent the Object much more bright and di∣stinct;
howbeit they are both capable of much further improvement, and
consequently be much more adapted for the use of the Sea, for which occa∣sion
I have at this time discours'd of them.</P>
<P>And I will undertake to accommodate Navigators with Telescopes of two
Foot in length, with which they shall be inabl'd, not only easily to find the
Object, but to discover also the times of the Eclipses of the <HI>Satellites</HI> of <HI>Ju∣piter,</HI>
as exactly as shall be needful.</P>
<P>Let therefore such Ephemerides be provided, and I shall procure an in∣genious
Workman, who shall provide such Telescopes fit for that purpose;
so that nothing will then be wanting to compleat the use of thofe Eclipses
for the discovery of the Longitudes of such parts as they shall be observable
in, save only an exact Time-keeper to observe the precise times of such ap∣pearances,
which I can also accommodate them withal; so that if the pre∣cise
time of the Setting of the Sun for that Night be known, they shall be
sure of the time of the Eclipse to a very few Seconds.</P>
<P>By such Methods and Instruments as I have now describ'd, if carefully
us'd, I doubt not but that the Sea-Coasts of all frequented parts of the
World might be truly plac'd as to their Longitudes and Trendings; and the
method of taking Latitudes being a little amended, the exact Situation of
all such places in some few Years, might be obtain'd, which would be of
great benefit for the perfecting that part of Geography which at this time
is very imperfect.</P>
<P>In my last Discourses I explained three several Instruments for the Use
and Benefit of Navigation, two of which have not been ever yet thought of
by any (that I have heard of) which yet I conceive will (if well made and
put in practice) be of very great advantage to Navigators; for that they are
new assistants to them in giving them information of what they have no other
ways of Learning: For by means of the last of the three they will be in∣abl'd
to discover the Latitude, when, by the commonly us'd Instruments,
they are necessitated to depend only upon Conjecture; namely, at such times
either of the Day or Night as the Horizon is not visible, and when the Sun
passes near the Zenith; and 'tis so much the more useful, for that Nocturnal
Observations may be made at all times, when the parts of the Sky, neat
the Zenith, shall be clear and free from Clouds. Any Observations may be
taken of such Stars as pass over or very near the Zenith with more ease and
certainty than of the Sun itself in the Day time; for that the Star observ'd doth
more precisely shew the very Points, when and where it passeth the Zenith
or the Meridian near it; and the Declination of the Star (which may be
learned from Tables ready calculated for that purpose, especially for the
most notable and conspicuous) will readily give the Latitude of the place.</P>
<P>As for the assistances the other may afford, it is hard to ascertain, yet
since it hath been found to be of very good use at Land to prejudge the Con∣stitution
of the Weather, especially of great store of Wind or Rain, 'tis very
probable it may be of as much, if not more, benefit at Sea, where the Air
seems to be of more general uniformity, especially in such parts of it as are
far remov'd from any Lands; for that the Situation of Mountains or other
diversify'd parts of the Earth, which arc oftentimes the Causes of Storms
and Rains on the Land, have little influence upon the parts of the Sea far
remov'd from thm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tho' possibly it may be found that the Gravity
of the Air may be differing at Sea from what it is at Land; which, if so,
might be of no small benefit to the Navigator, if he, could from that be in∣form'd
of his approach to Land. 'Tis not impossible neither, that it may
afford him some intimation of the depth of the Sea where he may be, and
many other things very desirable to be known, which I will leave <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the dis∣covery
of the di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igent Observer▪ There are many things, that before they
are discover'd, are look'd upon as impossible, which yet, when the are found,
<PB N="561" REF="540"/>
are said to be known by every one, the inventor only excepted, who must
pass for an Ignoramus.</P>
<P>I have many Years since shewn to this Society (as will, I suppose, appear
by their Journals) an Instrument to keep an exact account of the way of a
Ship through the Water;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of a way wiser for a Ship at Sea.</NOTE> whether it has been since try'd I know not, yet I
have many Years since that, heard of one or two who were getting a Patent
for a like Instrument; whether they succeeded or not, I have not inquir'd, for
I freely imparted it for a general Good, and should be glad to here that it
were put in practice, and perform'd what may, in all probability, be expected
from it, which, I conceive, will be a very exact and certain information of
the way of the Ship that useth it through the Water, it not only mea∣suring
the length of the Run, but the Rumb of the Leeward way; and the
Angles made upon the several Tacks and Courses; but yet 'tis defective for
finding the true way of the Ship over the parts of the Earth subjacent to
to that Sea, because it distinguisheth not the current or setting of that part
of the Sea without some other assistances, whence, 'till they are added, 'tis
useless for the invention of the Longitude, which is to be found by other
means: However, 'tis of great use to know the true Velocity of a Ship
through the Water, in short Voyages, or in foggy or dark Weather; because
it is a great help to judge of their present Position as to the true Course they
design to hold, and in narrow places they can better judge when 'tis fit to
tack about and stand another way.</P>
<P>There is another addition which I thought might also be of good use and
information to a Navigator,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Contrivance to know the strength and point of the Wind.</NOTE> and would afford him a means of exactly mea∣suring
that which he now knows only at random and by guess, and that is an
Instrument, which being fixt at the top of the Antient or Flagg-staff, should, at
all times, give the true strength or velocity of the Wind; and the information
thereof may easily be convey'd into the great Cabbin or the Steeradge of the
Ship. By the help of this and the former way of measuring the way of a
Ship, it would be easy to find with what Winds, whether large or scanty;
with what Sails, whether more or fewer, or how plac'd; with what Trim,
with what Burthen or Lading, with what Ballast, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Ship makes the
best way. This is a Proposition hitherto only prov'd by guess and strong
Opinion, for the most part very prejudicate and precarious; but by this
means it might be brought to a certain Standard of measure. By this means
also the comparative goodness of Ships for sailing or making their way
through the Water might be brought to a certainty of measurement, which
cannot so well be done by any other way now used; for tho' two Ships may
now sail not far asunder, and both intend the same course, yet which ever
has the better of it in sailing fastest, it will be disputable whether that be
the better Sailer; for tho' they are not far asunder, yet that which came
first to the Port, might have great advantages of the Wind, which the other
had not; and possibly it might be the contrary, there being yet no certain way
of determining it, unless by multiplicity of such trials, it shall always be
found that the same Vessel has the advantage, and yet even in this way the
probability indeed is, greater, but yet 'tis but a probability, since 'tis pos∣sible
that such advantages may happen for five or ten times together, and
yet may fail the eleventh time; whereas by this Instrument it will plainly ap∣pear
which hath had the greatest quantity or strength of the Wind, and
which the least; and by the same Instrument it may be certainly determin'd
with what Sails, with what Trim, with what Burthen and with what
Course, whether by or large, a Ship, comparatively, Sails best; as also it may
be practically examin'd with what Trim or set of the Sails a Ship a sails the
best when it goes near a Wind, and the like to see how far Experience will
agree to the Theory; as also whether flat and taught Sails do b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ter than
bellying or bunting Sails, which I conceive they do, tho' the most part of
Seamen do believe and affirm the contrary with great confidence. I could en∣umerate
many other useful informations these Instruments duly made would
afford, but it is needless at present, since what I have mention'd are matters
of so great concern in Naval Affairs to be truly inform'd of, that they alone are
sufficient (one would think) to induce some Inquisitive Men concerned, to be
<PB N="562" REF="541"/>
knowing, in these Affairs, to cause some trials to be made thereof, since no one
can deny but that the Consequences that I have asserted must necessarily follow;
that is, that all those Particulars which are hitherto only acquir'd by Con∣jecture
and Guessing are by means hereof reduc'd to certainty of Number,
Weight and Measure; and tho' some very skillful in these Affairs may say
they can do all that is requir'd well enough, without any such Invention, by
their own Judgments and long Experience; yet, I conceive, that he that uses
a pair of Compasses shall be able to draw a truer Circle than ever <HI>Apelles,</HI> or
the greatest Artist that ever drew Line with his Hand, would be able to do
without them.</P>
<P>The Instrument I design for this purpose, is but little differing from that
which I long since contriv'd for measuring the velocity of the Wind, and
caused one of them to be made for the Weather-clock. It has been suffici∣ently
seen and try'd, and therefore will not, for this time, need a more parti∣cular
Description; however, if any one designs to make trial thereof, I shall
not be wanting to give the Workman, that makes it, sufficient Instruction.</P>
<P>ALL that I can find of these Instruments are only the two following Extracts
out of the Registers of the Royal Society, which I have here publisht, hoping
they may give the Ingenious some hints of improving them, which indeed has been

<P><HI>November</HI> 14. 1683. Mr. <HI>Hook</HI> shew'd an Instrument to measure the Velocity of
the Air or Wind, and to find the strength thereof, which was by four Vanes put upon
an Axis, and made very light and easy for motion; and the Vanes so contriv'd, as
that they could be set to what slope should be desir'd: It was several times try'd
and examin'd in the long Gallery in <HI>Gresham College;</HI> whereby it appear'd, that
by walking from one end thereof to the other, and carrying the same above ones
Head, the Doors and Windows of the said Gallery being shut, and so the Air with∣in
it being not in motion but stagnant, the Instrument made so many turns as there
were Circumferential lengths of the said Vanes in the length of the Gallery; and if
by trial it were found to be more or less than the due measure of the Circumferenti∣al
lengths, then by setting the said Vanes either flatter or sharper in respect of the way
of its motion through and against the Air, the same was easy to be adjusted; the use
of which may be of very great consequence in the business of Sailing and steering a
Ship upon the Sea, and for examining the power and strength of the Wind upon Land
in order to the Theory of Shipping for which it was design'd.</P>
<Q>A Way wiser for the Sea; November 28. 1683.</Q>
<P>I shew'd an Instrument I had contriv'd, and shew'd some of the Society above
twenty years since, by which the way of a Ship through the Sea might be exactly
measur'd, as also the velocity of any running Water or River, and thereby the com∣parative
velocity of it in its several parts; by this also the quantity of the Water
vented by any River into the Sea, or any other River, might be found; it was one
part of a way wiser for the Sea. The whole Engine being design'd to keep a true ac∣count
not only of the length of the Run of the Ship thro' the Water, but the true Rumbor

A Lecture of the preference of strait to Bunting Sails, Read March 5. 1682-90.</Q>
<P>I have in this place formerly read several Discourses, and shewn many Ex∣periments
concerning Light and Gravity, which are two great and universal
powers in Nature;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Traite de la Lumiere.</HI></NOTE> by the later of which all Terrestial Bodies are powerful∣ly,
and (if their way be not impeded by the <HI>Media,</HI> through which they pass)
most rapidly mov'd towards the middle parts of the Earth, with velocities
always accelerated in sub-duplicate proposition of the aggregate of Powers
moving; of the effects of which Monsieur <HI>Huggens</HI> hath treated no further
than thereby to find what is the comparative Gravitation here upon the Sur∣face
of the Earth, with respect to the Gravitation at the distance of the Moon;
by which Examination of the proportion of Gravity he is much convinc'd
of the truth of that Theory which I had the happiness first to invent, and
of which I shall have occasion to discourse more at large on another Subject.
The other effects of Gravity upon Bodies here upon the Earth, which he o∣mits,
have been fully discover'd by <HI>Galileo, Torricellius,</HI> and divers others since
that time, who have all proceeded upon the equal power of Gravity, and con∣sequently
suppos'd an equal addition of Acceleration in equal spaces of time;
which in short spaces of Descent near the Earth, is <HI>quoad sensum</HI> true, there
being no sensible difference between the power of Gravity in so small a dif∣ference
of height, as Nature has allow'd Mankind a Liberty or Power of
arriving at, to make his trials in: As the top of some high Hill, or at the
bottom of some deep Mine; tho' yet possibly with curious Instruments and
accurate Observations, somewhat of discovery might be made on such a Hill
as <HI>Tenariff,</HI> or the <HI>Alps:</HI> For which Inquiry therefore one of the Experi∣ments,
which I formerly propos'd, to be try'd at <HI>Tenariff</HI> (and which I
try'd many times my self, both at the top of St. <HI>Pauls</HI> and at <HI>Westminster-Abby,</HI>
tho' without finding any sensible difference) was intended; as will
appear by the accounts of those trials, tho' they were unsuccessful as to what
they were design'd for; however several other Discoveries were made not
unuseful. But I shall not further proceed upon that Contemplation at pre∣sent,
but, rather, in this following Discourse, consider a third Power of Na∣ture
arising from the motions of the Air and Water, two fluid Mediums which
incompass the Body of the Earth. And among the various Effects they
produce, I shall at this time, consider only one which is procur'd by means of
Art,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Several mat∣ters to be known in the Art of Sailing.</HI></NOTE> and that is for the moving or regulating of Ships or Vessels by means
of Sails, Oares, Rudder, and the like artificial Methods of gaining and
making use of their Powers: It being of great use for Merchant Ships in
those times of danger, to know the best Methods and Means of making
these Powers the most serviceable to them that may be for flying from and
escaping the pursuit of their Enemies. There are therefore very many things
that must be consider'd, in order to the perfecting of this effect to the great∣est
advantage that is possible. As the Shape and Bigness of the Vessel with
consideration of its Use and Design, the manner of Rigging it and fitting it
with Masts, Sails, and other Tackle, and with Rudder, Oares, Keel, Lee∣boards,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Shapes and Magnitudes of each, and the ways of apply∣ing
and using them to the best advantage. And herein will come the consi∣deration
of the Power of the Wind upon Sails, Masts, Rigging and Hulk
of the Vessel: The power also of the Water against the Rudder, Oares,
Leeboards, Keel, Head and Sides of the Vessel will come under considera∣tion;
for it must be determin'd what quantity of Sails this or that kind of
Vessel will bear; and what the form of the Sail is best to be, and how to be
order'd or fitted to the Vessel; how much Ballast such Vessels so built and
rigged, will require, and what strength of Wind each kind of Vessel can
indure; what the strength of the Wind is with relation to its swifter mo∣tion
or higher blowing; what strength and length of Oares is neces∣sary
for induring the powers to be apply'd to them; and what Powers, whe∣ther
of Men, or other, can be apply'd; and what are the best and most ad∣vantageous
<PB N="564" REF="543"/>
vantageous ways for such applications: These, and many other particulars,
ought to be fully examin'd, both by the known Principles of Mechanicks, and
by Experiments on the several Materials that must be introduc'd into the Pro∣positions
of such Ratiocinations; for that abstracted Notions will not be so
serviceable in these Inquiries as the knowledge of the concrete Qualities and
Proprieties. And to be furnish'd with these many an pertinent Experi∣ments
must be invented, made, and diligently, as well as knowingly, ob∣serv'd;
for that the preponderancy of such Effects, may, and do often lie
in unheeded Circumstances, and in almost insensible differences; which ne∣vertheless,
upon the result of greater trials, prove very notable; and yet,
by reason of the Difficulty, Charge, loss of Time, and many other Incon∣veniences,
which are the necessary Concomitants of such greater Experi∣ments,
the smaller trials, tho' they require much more watchfulness and
perspicatiousness are much to be perferr'd: For that more may be examin'd
and verify'd in a Year by these, than by the other in an Age. And tho' the
business of Shipping and Navigation hath been many Ages in a way of im∣provement,
and somewhat very considerable has been done towards it, inso∣much
that the present state thereof is look'd upon as the highest Perfection
it is capable of, yet a few small trials might easily make the ground∣lessness
of that Opinion plainly appear, almost in every particular of the
artificial Structure of Vessels fitted for that design. I am not insensible of
the difficulties that attend any one that shall be an asserter of this Doctrine;
I have experimentally verify'd the effects of propounding new Inventions to
improve such as are at the present in vogue; witness the improvment of A∣stronomical
Instruments, the Spring-watches, the universality of Gravity,
and the motions of the Heavens, according to the Rules and Laws of Me∣chanical
Motions. And yet after all the obloquy and reproaches, and un∣handsome
treatment I have met with for making those discoveries, I find the
things themselves, in tract of Time, become to be approv'd, and come to
be of general use. There are, I believe, but very few In the World now
that will adhere to <HI>Hevelius</HI> his magnify'd Contrivances for Instruments with
plain Sights, tho' at the same time they joyn with him in the Aspersions he
hath cast upon me. But to let tliole Reflections pass at present, I know ve∣ry
well, that I shall find, opposite to this Doctrine about Ships, not only all
the Architects or Ships Builders, but the Crue of Navigators also, who are
very hard to be brought to the Use and Practise of a new Method, and are
not otherwise to be prevail'd with but <HI>gradatim</HI> by length of Time, and dear
bought Experience. But tho' the most are thus qualify'd, yet they are not
all: There are some that are willing to be better inform'd in this or that
Particular, and will make use and trial of things, tho' they carry with them
but a probability; for the sake therefore of such, 'tis if any discovery be
made; but for the rest <HI>Si Populus Vult, decipiatur.</HI></P>
<P>I have had many Discourses both with some of the ablest Ship-writes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of flat Sails.</HI></NOTE> and
with as skilful Navigators, and both agree in their Opinions or judg∣ments,
that a Bellying or Bunting Sail doth more promote or carry a Vessel
to Windward, than a flat and smooth Sail that bellies not at all; the con∣trary
of which I have divers times indeavour'd to defend. In order to clear
the reasonableness of this Assertion, I have, in the first place, consider'd the
Nature and Power of the Wind upon the Area of a Sail, various ways ex∣pos'd
to it; by which, by degrees, I shall come to the evident Demonstra∣tion
of what I have asserted: But because, possibly after all that can be
said and manifested by fuch a Demonstration; those that have asserted the
contrary, will not grant the Conclusion, after the Demonstration; I shall
prepare an Apparatus for the trial of an Experiment where the effect itself
shall speak the Conclusion, and that beyond the power of Contradiction.</P>
<P>To come then to the Reasons that induc'd me to make this Conclusion;
I say that fluid Bodies mov'd, do impress a motion to other Bodies, they
are mov'd against proportionate to their Gravity and Velocity: This may be
prov'd by thousands of Experiments. Next I find the Air to be a ponde∣rous
fluid Body, whose integrant parts have both bulk and weight in them
as well as the integrant parts of other fluid Terrestial Bodies; as Water,
<PB N="565" REF="544"/>
Oil, Quicksilver, and the like; and tho' they have a less proportion of Gra∣vity,
if compar'd to their bulk, or the space they seem to fill, and that so
very small, that they have, for a long time, been asserted to have a contrary
quality of lightness, yet, by undeniable Arguments drawn from Experiments,
they are demonstrated to have their proportion of Gravity with relation to
their bulk: Which proportion compar'd to the like proportion of Water,
is, for the most part, near as 1 to 800 or 900. It follows therefore, that the
motion of this fluid Body must, according to the quantity of its Gravity,
impress upon another Body that it is mov'd against, such a quantity of mo∣tion
in the same manner as the like quantity of another fluid Body, as Wa∣ter,
and if the motion be the same, the motion communicated will be as 1
to 800. If the Motions be reciprocal to the Gravities of the striking Bo∣dies,
the motions or powers communicated will be equal; for if there be by
the Velocity 28, 3 times as much Air in bulk mov'd against the Recipient Bo∣dy
as there is of the bulk of Water in the same time, and that the Velocity be
28, 3 swifter than that of the Water, then 28, 3 × 28, 3 will produce an equa∣lity
of Motion with the eight hundred Gravitating parts in the Water mov'd
with one degree of Velocity, as I shall more particularly prove afterwards.
Thus, if on a Stilyard a weight of thirty Pound be hung at thirty times
the distance from the Center that a weight of nine hundred Pounds is hung,
the Stilyard shall remain in aequilibrio, and neither end prependerate; for the
thirty Pound cannot be mov'd but it must have thirty times the Velocity that
the nine hundred Pound must have, and therefore the Stilyard must remain
without any motion at all, but stand in a aequilibrium. Since the product of
the bulk and Velocity of the one is equal to the Product of the Bulk and Velo∣city
of the other; this therefore holds where effects equiponderate.</P>
<P>The Wind then is nothing else but the Body of the Air mov'd as a fluid
with a certain degree of Velocity towards a certain part of the Horizon
upon the Surface or the Earth or Sea, and, as other fluid Mediums, it take<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
the easiest and shortest way it findeth to continue its direct motion; moving
round the edges of the Body that standeth in its way, after it hath <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat a∣gainst
it, and been reflected from it, and the parts reflected are quickly a∣gain,
by the succeeding Parts, recruited in their motion, and move along
with the other parts which have received no Impediment. The power of
the Wind therefore is to be computed according to the bigness of the Pris
of the Air which cometh to dash or strike against the Body that is expos'd
to it; and according to the Velocity that this Prism is mov'd forwards to
strike against it: For a fluid Medium, in motion, is to be consider'd as
made up of an indefinite number of small Cylinders, Prisms, Wires or
Strings lying close together, and so making up the Solidity of the greater
Prism of the Body of the fluid that is mov'd towards the Obstacle; and a∣gain
each of thcse small Prisms or Wires may be suppos'd as made up of an
indefinite number of small Beads or Dies lying one behind another, and so
following each other immediately in the same Line, and with the same Velo∣city
of motion, and every one of these compounding Beads or Dies coming
to beat or strike against the Body that lieth in its way, it so sirikes it and
communicates a motion; what motion it doth not communicate to that Bo∣dy
it meets with, is reflected back from it, with, or by an Angle equal to
the Angle of Incidence. So that upon this consideration each of the small
Prisms may be computed as a single Bullet or Die, so striking the Surface of
the expos'd Body with one degree of power all of bulk equal to the many
single ones separate; and the larger Prism made up of an indefinite number
of these lesser Wires or Prisms, may be conceiv'd and computed as a larger
Bead or Die, relation being always had to the Gravity and Velocity of the
impelling or striking Body. Now a round Body being mov'd against another
Body, impresseth on it some degree of motion, and what it doth not com∣municate,
is reflected from it, according to the known Laws of Reflection;
that is, the reflected Angle is equal to the Angle of Incidence upon the plain
of the Body struck, and the Body struck receiveth a motion Perpendicular to
the Surface of it that is so struck.</P>
<P><PB N="566" REF="545"/>
To come then to the Application of the Power of the Wind upon the
Sails of a Vessel, we are to consider the Expansion of the Sail, as it is ex∣pos'd
to the Impulse of the Wind; whether the Surface of it do cut the
Prism of the Wind that beareth against it at right Angles or Oblique; if it
cutteth the Prism at Right Angles, then the whole power of a Prism of
Wind or Air that cometh to blow upon it for a certain time, whose Basis is
equal and at right Angles with the length of the Prism, is to be computed
as communicating all its motion: But if the Area of the Sail cut the Prism
at oblique Angles, then we must conceive the Scalene Prism as cut at right
Angles, and compare the Area thereof with the Area of the Sail; and this
will give the magnitude or quantity of the impelling Prism of Wind against
the oblique Sail. Again, to know with what force this Scalene Prism doth press
or impel the Sail so obliquily posited Perpendicularly to its Surface, we
must compare the Degrees of Velocity,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Calculati∣on of the strength and difference.</HI></NOTE> with which it is mov'd directly to∣wards
the Area of the oblique Sail, and see what proportion it holdeth with
the direct and perpendicular motion upon the direct Sail; and by both these
Examinations duly made, the comparative power of the Wind upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>A∣rea
of the sloped Sail will appear. Let ab then represent the breadth of a
Sail of a given height, and let abcd represent a Prismatical Body of the
Air, which being mov'd from dc to ab in a given space of Time, maketh a
Wind of such strength bear or beat against the Surface of the Sail ab direct∣ly
oppos'd to its course, and in the given time all the parts of the Prism
abcd have struck against the Surface of the Sail ab. Suppose then ab no,
to represent a Prism of Water, of equal Base with the said Sail ab, and
that an, or bo, the length of the said Prism be ⅓ of the length ad or bc
the Prism of Air mov'd the contrary way with thirty times the Velocity, if
the proportion of the Gravity of the Air be to the Gravity of the Water,
as one to nine hundred: I say, the Sail shall not be mov'd either way, but
remain in an aequilibrium: For as the Velocity of the motion of the Wa∣ter
an, 1 is to the Velocity of the motion of the Air ad 30; so the Gravity
of the Prism of the Air ab cd 30, to the Gravity of the Prism of Water
abon 900. Now because the same power is imprest on the Sail, whether
the Cylinder of Water be mov'd against the Sail from no to ab, or the Sail
be mov'd against the Water from ab to no; if the said Cylinder of Air be
made one degree swifter, it must drive the fame Sail from ab, to no.</P>
<P>Next suppose Ef to represent the same Sail, set obliquely to the Prism or
Current of the Wind, draw eh, and fg, parallel to ad. First then it is plain,
that akhd and bcgi of the former Prism do now not at all touch the said
Sail ef, but only the middle part of the same, namely, kigh; now the
quantity of this to the quantity of the former, being as ki to ab; that is, as
pf, the sine of the Angle of incidence pef to the Radius ef, or ab, it fol∣lows
that the quantity of Wind upon the direct Sail to the quantity striking
the oblique Sail is, as Radius to the sign of the Angle of Incidence.</P>
<P>Again, the power of this Prism upon the oblique Sail ef, is to the power
of it upon the direct Sail, equal to ki, as el to fl; that is, as fp to fe; that
is, as the sine of the Angle of Incidence pef to the Radius; therefore the
power of the Wind upon the Sail ab, directly oppos'd to its motion is to the
power of it upon the same Sail set oblique to its motion, as the square of
Radius, to the square of the Angle of Incidence, or of the obliquity to the
Wind pef.</P>
<P>Now that the motion of the oblique Sail is to the motion of the direct
Sail by the same Prism of Wind as pf to fe, will plainly appear: Suppose
pfgh a solid Cylinder meeting with pfa direct Sail at pf, and fe the oblique
Sail; then pf will be carry'd on to ql, at the same time that ef will be mov'd
to lm; the motion therefore of pf is equal to fl, but the motion of ef is equal
to el: But as fl to el, so fe to fp, so Radius to the sine of Inclination or O∣bliquity.</P>
<P>Now that the strength or power of the Wind upon the Oblique Sail is Per∣pendicular
to the said Sail, is evident from this Consideration, that if the Sail
be suppos'd perfectly flat and small in its Surface, there is no part that the
Wind can take hold of to drive it forward in its own way, and having no
<PB N="567" REF="546"/>
part opposite to the power thereof, but only the said smooth Surface that
can only receive a Perpendicular pressure, and that pressure can only move
or thrust it toward the Perpendicular of its Surface: If therefore a Sail
be perfectly flat and smooth, all the force it receives is towards the Perpen∣dicular
of its Surface. Which Perpendicular force notwithstanding may
cause it to move in any other direction which is inclin'd to the said Perpendi∣cular,
by some Angle less than a right, according as the said Sail may be so
fix'd to a Body that shall have a more easy way for it to pass that way than
towards the Perpendicular. This may be explain'd from the consideration
of the power or Gravity: The power of Gravity then we know tends to
move the heavy Body towards the Perpendicular of the Horizon, that is,
towards the Center of the Earth; but if the heavy Body be so posited on a
P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain that has any inclination to the solid Perpendicular; that is, maketh a
less Angle with it than a right Angle; we know that the power of Gravity,
tho' it acts directly towards the Perpendicular, yet it moveth and impelleth
it to descend obliquely in any other Plain dipping below the Horizon. Now
the proportion of the power of the Wind upon the oblique Sail to drive it
backwards towards the Perpendicular, is to the proportion of its power to
drive it in any other Plain, is easy to be determin'd, but that I shall refer to
another opportunity.</P>
<P>Now since by this afore recited Cause it is evident, that the power of the
mov'd Air or Wind upon an oblique Sail, doth press or protrude it Per∣pendicularly
to the Surface of the Sail, and thence, if there be as free a pas∣sage
that way, as any other, the Sail will be mov'd, and move the Vessel to
which it is fix'd in the said Perpendicular; it follows, that if there be any
other part of the said Sail that has a differing inclination, it will have a differing
Perpendicular, and consequently every part of the bent Sail will have a dif∣fering
pressure and a differing tendency; and because that part of the Sail
which is next the Wind, is less belly'd than that which is from the Wind,
more of the Perpendicular Tendencies will be to fall from the Wind than to
go nigh or towards the Wind, and consequently, the composition of all the
tendencies together, will have less power to press the bent Sail towards the
Perpendicular of the set of the Yard of the Sail, than if the Sail were all
smooth in the plain of the Yard; for the fore part of the Sail next the Wind
becometh, by the bellying, to stand too sharp and near the Wind, and so
receiveth little power or force from the Wind, to promote it according to
those Perpendiculars, and the Aft-parts of the Sail stand too full, and so re∣ceive
most of its power, whose Perpendiculars tend too much from and be∣fore
the Wind; and the middle parts of the Sail which stand only true, are
so small a part of the whole, that the most part of the effect of the Wind is
lost or mistaken for the desir'd end.</P>
<P>This is one of the great Reasons why a Vessel, that is thus rigged, is not
able to sail on any Rumb within four Points, and why even there so little
way is made to the Windward, tho' there are several other Reasons also; of
which I shall Discourse on another opportunity.</P>

<HEAD>A Lecture of the manner of Rowing of the Antient Gallies, read <DATE>July 2. 1684.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>The greatest promoter of Mens Industry, Study and Invention for the
discovery of Arts, has been the necessity of usefulness of them for humane
Life. To which end next to <HI>Agriculture</HI> and <HI>Architecture,</HI> I conceive <HI>Navi∣gation</HI>
may be rank'd, by means whereof Men have pass'd to places of the
Earth otherwise inaccessible, and the whole Surface of the Land has been in∣habited
and peopl'd. And as it has been very useful in itself, so it has been
the occasion of inventing and perfecting many other Arts and Sciences, as
<HI>Geometry, Astronomy, Geography,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And tho' the devouring Teeth of Time hath scarce left us any scrap of
History that should acquaint us with the knowledge and practice of Men in
the first Ages of the World, yet such as we have do sufficiently inform us,
that in the younger times of the World, Ships and Navigation were known,
witness <HI>Homer, Jason,</HI> and the <HI>Argonauts</HI> not now to insist on, what we find
in Holy Writ concerning the <HI>Ark of Noah,</HI> which, tho' the Shape, Dimen∣sions
and Manner of building that Vessel, which was for a very peculiar and
extraordinary Use, were divinely reveal'd to <HI>Noah,</HI> yet it seems not unlike∣ly
but that there might be many other sorts of Vessels known and in use long
before that time, as in probability there were many Arks or Chests for com∣mon
use long before the Lord directed <HI>Moses</HI> in the Bigness, Form and Ma∣terials
of the second <HI>Ark,</HI> which was the <HI>Ark of the Testimony.</HI> But this I
shall not insist on; I know the Accounts are but very short, and so nothing
positivively concluded from thence that there were Ships; much less can we
find what they were, or to what perfection <HI>Navigation</HI> was practis'd: Nay,
we are much to seek what was the true form of Ships in the more modern
Times of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans;</HI> of which times, notwithstanding, in respect
of other particulars, we have much more full and compleat Relations. That
there were Vessels of prodigious bulk and burthen, we are assur'd by <HI>Pliny,
Plutarch,</HI> and others; that they carry'd prodigious numbers of Men, both of
Soldiers and Seamen, that they had great numbers of Oars and Men to ma∣nage
them; and that they had Ballast, Maiss, Sails and Rudders, and could
Sail both before and by the Wind, is also evident. But then what was the
true shape of the Vessel both under and above the Water; what the form
of their Oars and how they us'd them; what their greatest velocity either
of Sailing or Rowing; what their strength for bearing Sail, or induring the
Sea, and the like; of these Histories give so little an account, that the best
Judgments of the greatest Criticks, are but uncertain Conjectures and short
of giving satisfactory Answers and Solutions, And had not the antient Car∣vers
help'd the Historians, we should have been much more to seek; for ac∣cording
to the Descriptions that Criticks have given us of the way of using
their Oars, which is much after the Modern way of using them in Boats,
Barges and Gallies; I see not how it could be possible to manage the upper∣most
Oar of forty or fifty; for so many, 'tis said by <HI>Plut arch</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> and
others, have been us'd in each order. I have therefore omitted all the Cri∣ticisms
concerning this matter; of which there is much to be found in <HI>Bu∣daeus,
Bayfius, Scaliger, Snellius, Pancirollus,</HI> and more especially <HI>Meibomius;</HI> and
apply'd my self to consider the thing as I find it express'd in the remaining
<HI>Basso Relievos</HI> of the Antients. And upon the whole I conceive that the way
of Rowing us'd by the Antients, was wholly differing from what we now <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se,
and not at all like that which the Learned <HI>Meibomius</HI> has taken so much pains
to explain.</P>
<P>I shall not trouble you with long <HI>Ambages</HI> either in confuting the Opinions
of others or Criticising upon the Words or Phrases of Historians, but rather
in short tell you the sum of what I judge of this matter.</P>
<P>First then, I conceive, that the Oars us'd by the Antients were very much like
the Oars now us'd, but broader and flatter, shorter and lighter, and manag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
only by one or two.</P>
<P>Secondly, That they were mov'd not vibrating forward and backwards as
ours now are, but inwards and outwards.</P>
<P><PB N="569" REF="548"/>
Thirdly, That they did not lie Horizontal as ours do, but almost Perpen∣dicular;
and when they lay a ground, the Oares serv'd instead of Legs or
Props to sustain the Vessel or Hull when its Belly was not broad enough to lie
upright, and it was crank sided.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That they were not lifted out of the Water, but always re∣main'd
immers'd.</P>
<P>Fifthly, That they always promoted the Vessel whether they were mov'd
outwards or inwards.</P>
<P>Sixthly, That the Rowers did seldom sit with their Faces to the Poop of
the Vessel, but sometimes with their Faces toward the Prow, and, for the
most part, with their Faces outward and forwards.</P>
<P>Seventhly, That in the smaller Vessels as <HI>Biremes, Triremes Quadriremes,</HI>
and <HI>Penteres,</HI> the Oares went through round holes made in the sides.</P>
<P>Eighthly, That in the <HI>Triremes</HI> the <HI>Thranites</HI> sat formost, and at the top
the <HI>Zygites</HI> just behind him and below him; and 3<HI>dly,</HI> The <HI>Thalamites</HI> behind
the <HI>Zygites</HI> and below him, and so the <HI>Zygites</HI> Oare was mov'd up and down be∣hind
the back of the <HI>Thranites</HI> and the <HI>Thalamites</HI> behind the <HI>Zygites.</HI></P>
<P>Ninethly, That the Hull of the <HI>Triremes,</HI> &amp;c. were built much bredthing or
spreading upwards, and over hanging, so that the holes that were made for
the Oares of the <HI>Zygites</HI> and <HI>Thalamites</HI> went out almost Perpendicular; and
in some there was an oversailing, or projecture of the Hull at the place, but
especially in greater Vessels; the Oares of the <HI>Thranites</HI> were either put thro'
a hole of the checquer'd Railings at the top, or else laid in a Notch on the
edge of the Ships sides, and bound down either with an Iron or Rope; so
that when the <HI>Thranites</HI> thrust the handle of his Oar from him, it would not
rise out of the Notch.</P>
<P>Tenthly, That the <HI>Remiges</HI> or Rowers in greater Vessels, such as the <HI>Hep∣teres,
Octoeres,</HI> &amp;c, were plac'd Galleries which oversail'd the Hull of the
Vessel, which were made by Beams lying quite cross the Hull of the Ship
and made a very broad Dock, not like the Modern Gallies, but such, as I
conceive, was quite flush from end to end of the Beams; at the other side
of which Galleries there was made a grating or side to defend the Rowers.
In these kinds of Vessels the <HI>Remiges</HI> or Rowers did stand side to side, and
the Oar went Perpendicular into the Sea, in the out part of the oversailing
Beams, and the Rowers, in the way of Skulling, mov'd their Oars altogether,
either outward or inward; by which means they were able to employ such
a vast number of Rowers, wherein every one should be able to exert his
whole strength in promoting the Ship, and so must needs be able to make it
move with a prodigious swiftness, much beyond the swiftness of any Gally or
Galliot.</P>
<P>By this means what <HI>Plutarch</HI> writes concerning the Vessel built by <HI>Ptolo∣maeus
Philopator</HI> may be well conceiv'd, which would otherwise seem incre∣dible
and impossible; for 'twas 280 Cubits long, or, as <HI>Snellius</HI> computes,
420 Cubits and 38 in bredth, or 57 Foot; the height from bottom to top was
52 Cubits; it carry'd 400 Mariners besides 4000 Rowers, and near 3000
Soldiers. How these Rowers should be plac'd according to the forms they
conceiv'd, both <HI>Scaliger</HI> and <HI>Snellius</HI> were at a great loss; insomuch that <HI>Snellius</HI>
thinks it impossible to dispose the Rowers, unless they were pack'd up like Salt
Herrings. <HI>Vt nefas sit credere haec transtra a Remigibus occupari potuisse, nisi for∣san
cos tanquam halices &amp; salsamem a stipatos intelligas,</HI> are his words. And,
according to the manner of Rowing they conceiv'd, it would have been ve∣ry
difficult. Nor would <HI>Meibomius</HI> his Contrivance have help'd them; but
in the way I propounded of the spreading of the Vessel upward; it will not
be difficult, where, tho' the highest Oars will be frill the longest, and so
they will need a Counterpoise of Lead at the Handle to ballance the weight
of the Shank, as <HI>Atheneus</HI> affirms they had in this Vessel of <HI>Ptolomaeus Philopa∣tor,</HI>
yet going down into the Water nearer to a Perpendicular than a Hori∣zontal
Posture, it may easily enough be conceiv'd; but these kind of mon∣strous
Vessels were rather for shew than use, as <HI>Snellius</HI> well observes.</P>
<P>Eleventhly, That the flat of the Blade of the Oar did not go into the
Water Perpendicular, and cross the length of the Vessel, as our Oars
<PB N="570" REF="549"/>
now, but rather parallel with the length of the Vessel, and so were canted
with the foremost edge outwards, when they were strained outwards and
the foremost edge inward, when they were strain'd towards the Vessel; by
which means they always promoted and impell'd the Vessel forwards, and
that in a very natural and efficacious way; in the same manner, as all Fishes
do swim and force their way through the Water.</P>
<P>Twelfthly, To confirm this Opinion, I shall only instance in the Modern
Practise, which is yet in use in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> where this manner of Row∣ing
is still in use, tho' somewhat mixed with the Northern or our modern
way of Rowing; for in their Barges the Rowers all stand, and indifferently
with their Face or Back to the Prow of the Vessel, and sometimes half one
way half the other, and so indifferently can make the Vessel move forwards or
backwards without altering their posture; as, without question, all the an∣tient
Vessels could likewise be mov'd; which gives a Reason why, in <HI>Ptolo∣my</HI>'s
Vessel, there were four Rudders, namely, one on each side before, or
in the Prow, and one on each side behind or in the Poop. And the <HI>Indian</HI>
Rudder also which is still in use, is of the same fashion with that of the <HI>Greeks</HI>
and <HI>Romans,</HI> save only, that instead of planting it on each end the Vessel,
they place it in the middle abaft, and so it indifferently serves for Steering
the Vessel, whether going forward or backwards, and is much more conve∣nient
and easy to manage than the way of Rudders now in use with us. The
Curry Curries also are still mov'd or row'd in the same manner with those of
the Antients, as I conceive, the Rowers sitting all on Bamboos at a distance
from the Vessel and Sculling the Vessel by canting the Oars in the manner
I have describ'd; and 'tis not unlikely but the Gallerys of Gallies might have
been some Remainder of the Galleries of the Antients, tho' they are accom∣modated
to the Modern way of Rowing.</P>
<P>I am not insensible how great the Difficulties are in the introducing a new
Opinion: Or to persuade one, that has long believ'd a thing to be one way,
that it is another, especially about such matters as are thought to be thorough∣ly
understood, and most generally put in practice and approv'd. But then
I know also, that how generally soever any thing be believ'd and asserted to
be true, and the best that 'tis possible, yet that there may be, hath been,
and always will be left room enough to find out farther Discoveries
and Improvements of Mens Knowledge and Understanding, even in that
particular, and that 'tis as hard to find and set Bounds and Limits to
the power of the Mind; as to set what is the greatest or least Extension or
Demension of Body in Nature: I expect the Criticks first, next the Skilful
in the present Naval Architecture, And, Thirdly, Such as have not so
much consider'd this part of Mechanicks, may be opponents to this particu∣lar
Opinion and Explication of this piece of antient History, whose fate it
hath been hitherto either not to be understood, or not to be believ'd; for
what hath hitherto been the cause of these Effects may still remain so to
have an influence upon Mens Minds, as not easily to admit the entrance of
a new or contrary proposal. However, as far as I am able, I shall indeavour
to satisfy each of these Opponents in the explication of those things which
may seem the most difficult.</P>
<P>It cannot be expected, I suppose, that from some few collected Rafts and
Fragments which have scap'd the devouring Sea of Time, in which the Arts
and Knowledge of the Antients have been Shipwrack'd and lost, I should be
able to give so true and positive an account of every particular part, as could not
be contradicted: But taking for granted that the Histories are true that af∣ford
us that information we have; I conceive there is no difficulty to shew a
way how the same might be effected which is affirm'd to have been done; and
to begin with the smallest which was the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or a Boat with one Oar:
This was fastned to one side behind, in the same manner as the <HI>Temo</HI> or Rud∣der,
by a Strap or Ring, or else was put through a hole; the handle of which,
the Rower sitting with his Face towards the Prow, and holding in his two
Hands, mov'd fromwards and towards the side of the Vessel, canting the
<HI>Tonsa</HI> or Blade thereof with his Hands, by which the Vessel was both readi∣ly
promoted and also guided; of this Oar the <HI>Tonsa</HI> or blade was very broad,
<PB N="571" REF="550"/>
by which means the Rower could exert his whole strength the better. The
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> had two of the flat Oars behind on each side one, which
were either mov'd by two Men, or else sometimes by one who manag'd the
two Oars, in each Hand one. So <HI>Lucian</HI> brings in <HI>Charon</HI> in his Dialogues
thus speaking, <HI>Ego quamvis senex duos remos concitans navigo Solus.</HI> Not like
our common Scullers which manage their Oars almost on a level, but after
the same manner, as I before mention'd was done by the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: The man∣ner
of using these will appear plainly from the Basso-Relievos on the <HI>Columna
Trajana,</HI> which is a most undeniable Record of History, and to be prefer'd
before any Writings in Books of those times, since there may have been so
many Transcripts or Coppies made one after another, of Historians, and e∣very
one of those might multiply the Errors and Mistakes of the first
Transcriber, whence Criticks find and amend so many Errors and make more,
whereas this has undoubtedly stood the same since it was first erected, which
was in the time of <HI>Trajan</HI> when those Vessels were actually made and us'd.
This gave me the first Hint or Conception of this way of using the Oars,
and I cannot find any one passage either in the Carving or Writings of the
Antients that doth any ways contradict it; and taking that for granted, it
will be easy to explain all that is related in History concerning their greater,
even their greatest Vessels which had the greatest numbers of Rowers and
Oars, which I take to be almost impossible to be done any other way.</P>
<P>Now that this is not so preposterous a Conception as some may imagine, nor
so fantastical, ridiculous, silly and insignificant a way of using Oars, as some have
thought: give me leave to add one Argument, and that is this, that Nature
is generally the best guide for Art to imitate. If this be doubted, I can pro∣duce
Arguments enough to evince it; but if it be not, then, I say, that this
way of Rowing (which I propose) comes the nearest to the method of Na∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>
in the making animated Bodies pass through fluid Mediums, and there∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> probably the best; for there is scarce a Fish in the Water, a Bird or
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ct in the Air but moves itself through those fluid <HI>Media</HI> by the same me∣thod
with this I propound; that both the Tails and Fins of Fishes are
this way mov'd, is most evident to any one that shall strictly examine it; and
<HI>Borell▪</HI> in his Book <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imalium</HI> has well explain'd it, that several of
those Birds that dive under Water, such as <HI>Didappers, Coots, Puffins,</HI> &amp;c. do
under Water move their Wings in this manner, I have often times seen my
self and observ'd: And that all Birds and Insects by the same kind of motion
of their Wings, fly in the Air: Any that will examine will so find it. So that
could there have been a better way, Nature would have taken it. Some mo∣tions
indeed there are that seem a little to imitate this, and that is the mo∣tion
of the Sea Fowl, <HI>Swans, Goose, Coots,</HI> &amp;c. at the top of the Water, when
they begin to rise and take the Wing; but then 'tis but by accident; for
all these Fowl indeavouring to use their Wings by striking the Air, being
near the Water, strike the Surface of it with the extreamity or blade of their
Wings, after they have first struck the Air; and with the flat of their Feet
help to push themselves forward to get a celerity of Progression, which is
necessary for their rise, treading, as it were, the top of the Water, and for
want of that help, some of the short Wing'd Fowl, as <HI>Puffins,</HI> &amp;c. are not
able to rise into the Air from plain ground, but from the Rocks they precipi∣tate
themselves on their Wings to acquire a necessary velocity; which all o∣ther
long Winged Fowl are able to procure by the help of their Feet, swift∣ly
treading the Ground, and with their long Wings beating the Air.</P>
<P>The greatest Objections I have yet met with are these, Firft, That 'twas
absurd to conceive, that the Ships Row'd sometimes backwards as well as
forwards, and had Rudders at both ends, but for this <HI>Suidas</HI> upon the word
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, says <HI>sunt &amp; quaedam quae binis gubernaculis a prora &amp; a puppi instructae
sunt, ut ubi{que} conversione in hostes navis feratur aut Recedat, eos{que} tam progressu
quam Recessu fallat.</HI> And that some Ships had such Rudders. <HI>viz.</HI> two before
and two behind, is evident from the Description of <HI>Philopator</HI>'s Ship also in
the fifth Book of <HI>Athenaeus,</HI> where he says it was <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>biprora
&amp; bipuppis,</HI> a double bottom'd Vessel, or two join'd together; for otherwise
I cannot conceive how three thousand arm'd Men could be plac'd between the
<PB N="572" REF="551"/>
Rowers, on which there were two thousand on each side. Now by this way
of Rowing, I suppose the Rowers could very easily, with the same motion of
the Oar, Row the Ship either forward or backwards; and tho' they had but
one Rudder, yet they could easily Steer the Vessel by it, tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it were mov'd
backwards; for the Blade <HI>Tonsa,</HI> or palm of the Rudder, was broad and e∣qually
extended on both sides the Stalk or middle, and so was always on a
Counterpoise.</P>
<P>The manner how the <HI>Tonsa</HI> of the Oar cut the Water will be better un∣derstood
by the Figure than by the words alone. Let AB represent the Wa∣ter
Section of a Dicrotos; E and N the canting Section of the Palm of the
Oars in the Water; these being mov'd outwards from the Boat, slide against
the Water from E to F, and from N to O, and at the same time carry the
Vessel from AB to CD; then the Cants of the Oars being alter'd at G and P,
and mov'd inward, they slide against the side of the Water by the Lines GH
and PQ, and promote the Vessel from IK to LM, and so successively; which
is the same motion with the Tail of a Fish in the Water, by which its Body is
most powerfully carry'd forwards; which is easy to be conceiv'd, and will
effectually perform what it ought to do.</P>
<P>This single motion then once understood, it will not be difficult to con∣ceive
all the rest in any of their other Vessels.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Moneres</HI> was nothing but several Couples of these Oars lying one
before another, as thick as they could sit, leaving only room for the Perpen∣dicular
motion of the Handle of the Oar behind the back of the next Rower
that sat before him, and not so much space as is requir'd in the modern way
of Rowing, where the motion of the Handle or Blade of the Oar is Horizon∣tal.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dieres</HI> or <HI>Biremes</HI> were double Orders of those Oars or Rowers; the
Rowers sometimes sitting side by side, upon the same Bench, the <HI>Thranites</HI>
sitting next the side, and the <HI>Zygites</HI> next within; the <HI>Thranites</HI> Oar usually
lay at the top in a half round Notch, and in the inside was tied down with a
Strap call'd <HI>Strappum</HI> by <HI>Vitruvius,</HI> or else it way thrust through some hole of
the Rails at the sides of the Vessel, the Oar of the <HI>Zygites</HI> pass'd through a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ole, a little below and nearer to the Poop, and cut the Water with the
same inclination.</P>
<P>The <HI>Trieres</HI> or <HI>Triremes</HI> had three <HI>Versus</HI> or Files of these Rowers, there
being three in each <HI>Ordo</HI> or Rank; the <HI>Thalanites</HI> and <HI>Zygites,</HI> for the most
part, sat as in the <HI>Biremes,</HI> but the <HI>Thalamites</HI> sat upon the Foot-step of the
<HI>Thranites;</HI> the Oars of the <HI>Zygites</HI> and <HI>Thramites</HI> went through round holes
in the side of the Vessel.</P>
<P>The <HI>Quadriremes</HI> had four Rowers in a Rank, sitting upon the upper Bench,
and two upon the Foot-step; the <HI>Thalamites</HI> and <HI>Thramites</HI> sat next the side
of the Vessel, and the <HI>Zygites</HI> next within them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hepteres</HI> had all the Men sitting or standing in one Rank, and at one
Height, but that Rank a little sloped, to let the Oars have free passage one
by another.</P>
<P>Those of a greater number of Rowers in an order, had both several stati∣ons
of Seats and several Men upon each Seat; as the <HI>Dekeres</HI> might have three
ascents of Seats, and have three Rowers on the lowest, three on the next, and
four on the highest Bench: But these are but Conjectures, as are, for the most
part, all the other above the <HI>Triremes,</HI> there being nothing that I have yet
met with in the Writings of the Antient Historians, or in the <HI>Basso Rilievos</HI>
now remaining that can clear that Doubt. But certain it is, that by this way
of Rowing, as great a number of Men may conveniently enough be plac'd to
manage each his Oar; and thereupon exert his own strength for the promo∣ting
of the Ship, as are Recorded to have been made use of by the Antients,
which I conceive cannot be done by any other way of Rowing yet known.</P>
<P>I shall not now insist upon the great use there may be made of this Princi∣ple
in Shipping, but only hint, that how slight soever it may at first appear,
it may possibly be prov'd to be of as great concern to <HI>England,</HI> as any thing
hitherto done in Shipping.</P>
