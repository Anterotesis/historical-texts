<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
<P>§ I. WHEN the parliament met in October,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1703.</NOTE> the
Queen in her speech took notice of the de∣claration
by the Duke of Savoy, and the treaty with Por∣tugal,
as circumstances advantageous to the alliance. She
told them, that although no provision was made for the
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
expedition to Lisbon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VIII. 1703.</NOTE> and the augmentation of the land∣forces,
the funds had answered so well, and the produce
of prizes been so considerable, that the public had not run
in debt by those additional services: that she had contri∣buted
out of her own revenue to the support of the circle
of Suabia, whose firm adherence to the interest of the
allies deserved her seasonable assistance. She said, she
would not engage in any unnecessary expense of her own,
that she might have the more to spare towards the case of
her subjects. She recommended dispatch and union, and
earnestly exhorted them to avoid any heats or divisions
that might give encouragement to the common enemies
of the church and state. Notwithstanding this admoni∣tion,
and the addresses of both Houses, in which they
promised to avoid all divisions, a motion was made in the
House of Commons for renewing the bill against occa∣sional
conformity, and carried by a great majority. In
the new draught, however, the penalties were lowered,
and the severest clauses mitigated. As the court no longer
interested itself in the success of this measure, the House
was pretty equally divided with respect to the speakers,
and the debates on each side were maintained with equal
spirit and ability: at length it passed, and was sent up to
the Lords, who handled it still more severely. It was op∣posed
by a small majority of the bishops, and particularly
by Burnet of Sarum, who declaimed against it, as a
scheme of the papists to set the church and protestants
at variance. It was successively attacked by the Duke of
Devonshire, the Earl of Pembroke, the Lords Haversham,
Mohun, Ferrars, and Wharton. Prince George of Den∣mark
absented himself from the House; and the ques∣tion
being put for a second reading, it was carried in the
negative: yet the Duke of Marlborough and Lord Go∣dolphin
entered their dissent against its being rejected,
though the former had positively declared, that he thought
the bill unseasonable. The Commons having perused
a copy of the treaty with Portugal, voted forty thou∣sand
men, including five thousand marines, for the sea-service
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
of the ensuing year; and a like number of land∣forces,
to act in conjunction with the allies, besides the
additional ten thousand: they likewise resolved, That the
proportion to be employed in Portugal should amount to
eight thousand. Sums were granted for the maintenance
of these great armaments, as well as for the subsidies pay∣able
to her Majesty's allies; and funds appointed equal to
the occasion. Then they assured the Queen, in an address,
that they would provide for the support of such alliances
as she had made, or should make, with the Duke of
Savoy.</P>
<P>§ II. At this period the nation was alarmed by the de∣tection
of a conspiracy said to be hatched by the Jacobites
of Scotland. Simon Fraser Lord Lovat, a man of despe∣rate
enterprise, profound dissimulation, abandoned morals,
and ruined fortune, who had been outlawed for having
ravished a sister of the Marquis of Athol, was the person to
whom the plot seems to have owed it's origin. He repaired
to the court of St. Germain's, where he undertook to as∣semble
a body of twelve thousand Highlanders to act in
favour of the Pretender, if the court of France would
assist them with a small reinforcement of troops, together
with officers, arms, ammunition, and money. The
French King seemed to listen to the proposal; but, as
Fraser's character was infamous, he doubted his veracity.
He was, therefore, sent back to Scotland with two other
persons, who were instructed to learn the strength and
sentiments of the clans, and endeavour to engage some of
the nobility in the design of an insurrection. Fraser no
sooner returned than he privately discovered the whole
transaction to the Duke of Queensberry, and undertook to
make him acquainted with the whole correspondence be∣tween
the Pretender and the Jacobites. In consequence of
this service he was provided with a pass, to secure him
from all prosecution; and made a progress through the
Highlands, to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound the inclination of the chieftains.
Before he set out on this circuit, he delivered to the Duke
a letter from the Queen Dowager at St. Germain's, di∣rected
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
to the Marquis of Athol: it was couched in general
terms, and superscribed in a different character; so that,
in all probability, Fraser had forged the direction, with a
view to ruin the Marquis, who had prosecuted him for
the injury done to his sister. He proposed a second journey
to France, where he should be able to discover other more
material circumstances; and the Duke of Queensberry
procured a pass for him to go to Holland from the Earl of
Nottingham, though it was expedited under a borrowed
name. The Duke had communicated his discovery to the
Queen, without disclosing his name, which he desired
might be concealed: her Majesty believed the particulars,
which were confirmed by her spies at Paris, as well as by
the evidence of Sir John Maclean, who had really been
conveyed from France to England in an open boat, and
apprehended at Folkstone. This gentleman pretended at
first, that his intention was to go through England to his
own country, in order to take the benefit of the Queen's
pardon; and this, in all probability, was his real design:
but, being given to understand that he would be treated
in England as a traitor, unless he should merit forgive∣ness,
by making important discoveries, he related all he
knew of the purposed insurrection. From his informa∣tion
the ministry gave directions for apprehending one
Keith, whose uncle had accompanied Fraser from France,
and knew all the intrigues of the court of St. Germain's.
He declared, that there was no other design on foot, except
that of paving the way for the Pretender's ascending the
throne after the Queen's decease. Ferguson, that veteran
conspirator, affirmed that Fraser had been employed by
the Duke of Queensberry to decoy some persons whom he
hated into a conspiracy, that he might have an opportu∣nity
to effect their ruin; and by the discovery establish
his own credit, which began to totter. Perhaps there was
too much reason for this imputation. Among those who
were seised at this time, was a gentleman of the name of
Lindsay, who had been under-secretary to the Earl of
Middleton. He had returned from France to Scotland, in
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
order to take the benefit of the Queen's pardon, under the
shelter of which he came to England, thinking himself
secure from prosecution. He protested he knew of no
designs against the Queen or her government; and that
he did not believe she would ever receive the least injury or
molestation from the court of St. Germain's. The House
of Lords having received intimation of this conspiracy,
resolved, That a commi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tee should be appointed to exa∣mine
into the particulars; and ordered, That Sir John
Maclean should be next day brought to their House. The
Queen, who was far from being pleased with this instance
of their officious interposition, gave them to understand by
message, that she thought it would be inconvenient to
change the method of examination already begun; and
that she would in a short time inform the House of the
whole affair. On the seventeenth day of December the
Queen went to the House of Peers, and having passed the
bill for the land-tax, made a speech to both Houses, in
which she declared, that she had unquestionable informa∣tion
of ill practices and designs carried on by the emissa∣ries
of France in Scotland. The Lords persisting in their
resolution to bring the enquiry into their own House, chose
their select committee by ballot; and, in an address, thanked
her Majesty for the information she had been pleased to
communicate.</P>
<P>§ III. The Commons taking it for granted that the
Queen was disobliged at these proceedings of the Upper
House, which, indeed, implied an insult upon her ministry,
if not upon herself, presented an address, declaring them∣selves
surprised to find, that when persons suspected of
treasonable practices were taken into custody by her Ma∣jesty's
messengers, in order to be examined, the Lords, in
violation to the known laws of the land, had wrested
them out of her hands, and arrogated the examination
solely to themselves; so that a due enquiry into the evil
practices and designs against her Majesty's person and
government might, in a great measure, be obstructed.
They earnestly desired, that she would suffer no diminu∣tion
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
of the prerogative; and they assured her they would,
to the utmost of their power, support her in the exercise
of it at home, as well as in asserting it against all invasions
whatsoever. The Queen thanked them for their concern
and assurances; and was not ill pleased at the nature of
the address, though the charge against the Peers was not
strictly true; for there were many instances of their hav∣ing
assumed such a right of enquiry. The Upper House
deeply resented the accusation. They declared, that by
the known laws and customs of parliament, they had an
undoubted right to take examinations of persons charged
with criminal matters, whether those persons were, or
were not in custody. They resolved, That the address
of the Commons was unparliamentary, groundless, with∣out
precedent, highly injurious to the House of Peers,
tending to interrupt the good correspondence between the
two Houses, to create an ill opinion in her Majesty of
the House of Peers, of dangerous consequence to the li∣berties
of the people, the constitution of the kingdom, and
privileges of parliament. They presented a long remon∣strance
to the Queen, justifying their own conduct, ex∣plaining
the steps they had taken, recriminating upon the
Commons, and expressing the most servent zeal, duty,
and affection to her Majesty. In her answer to this re∣presentation,
which was drawn up with elegance, propri∣ety,
and precision, she professed her sorrow for the mis∣understanding
which had happened between the two
Houses of Parliament, and thanked them for the concern
they had expressed for the rights of the crown and the pre∣rogative,
which she should never exert so willingly as for
the good of her subjects, and the protection of their liberties.</P>
<P>§ IV. Among other persons seised on the coast of Sussex,
on their landing from France, was one Boucher, who,
had been aide-du-camp to the Duke of Berwick. This
man, when examined, denied all knowledge of any con∣spiracy:
he said, that being weary of living so long
abroad, and having made some unsuccessful attempts to
obtain a pass, he had chosen rather to cast himself on the
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
Queen's mercy, than to remain longer in exile from his
native country. He was tried and condemned for high∣treason,
yet continued to declare himself ignorant of the
plot. He proved, that in the war of Ireland, as well as
in Flanders, he had treated the English prisoners with
great humanity. The Lords desisted from the prosecution;
he obtained a reprieve, and died in Newgate. On the
twenty-ninth day of January the Earl of Nottingham told
the House, that the Queen had commanded him to lay
before them the papers containing all the particulars hi∣therto
discovered of the conspiracy in Scotland; but that
there was one circumstance which could not yet be pro∣perly
communicated, without running the risque of pre∣venting
a discovery of greater importance. They forth∣with
drew up and presented an address, desiring, that all
the papers might be immediately submitted to their in∣spection.
The Queen said she did not expect to be pressed
in this manner immediately after the declaration she had
made; but in a few days the Earl of Nottingham deli∣vered
the papers sealed to the House, and all the Lords
were summoned to attend on the eighth day of February,
that they might be opened and perused. Nottingham was
suspected of a design to stisle the conspiracy. Complaint
was made in the House of Commons, that he had dis∣charged
an officer belonging to the late King James, who
had been seised by the governour of Berwick. A warm
debate ensued, and at length ended in a resolve, That the
Earl of Nottingham, one of her Majesty's principal secre∣taries
of state, for his great ability and diligence in the
execution of his o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ice, for his unquestionable fidelity to
the Queen and her government, and for his steady adher∣ing
to the church of England as by law established, highly
merited the trust her Majesty had reposed in him. They
ordered the Speaker to present this resolution to the
Queen, who said, she was glad to find them so well sa∣tisfied
with the Earl of Nottingham, who was trusted by
her in so considerable an office. They perused the exami∣nations
of the witnesses which were laid before them,
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
without passing judgment, or offering advice on the sub∣ject:
but they thanked her Majesty for having communi∣cated
those particulars, as well as for her wisdom and care
of the nation. When the Lords proceeded with uncom∣mon
eagerness in their enquiry, the Lower House, in ano∣ther
address, renewed their complaints against the conduct
of the peers, which they still affirmed was without a pre∣cedent.
But this was the language of irritated faction, by
which indeed both sides were equally actuated.</P>
<P>§ V. The select committee of the Lords prosecuted the
enquiry, and founded their report chiefly on the confession
of Sir John Maclean, who owned, that the court of
St. Germain's had listened to Lovat's proposal: that
several councils had been held at the Pretender's court on
the subject of an invasion; and that persons were sent
over to sound some of the nobility in Scotland. But the
nature of their private correspondence and negociation
could not be discovered. Keith had tampered with his
uncle to disclose the whole secret; and this was the cir∣cumstance
which the Queen declined imparting to the
Lords, until she should know the success of his endea∣vours,
which proved ineffectual. The uncle stood aloof;
and the ministry did not heartily engage in the enquiry.
The House of Lords having finished these examinations,
and being warmed with violent debates, voted, That there
had been dangerous plots between some persons in Scot∣land
and the courts of France and St. Germain's; and,
That the encouragement for this plotting arose from the
not settling the succession to the crown of Scotland in the
House of Hanover. These votes were signified to the
Queen in an address; and they promised, that when the
succession should be thus settled, they would endeavour to
promote the union of the two kingdoms upon just and
reasonable terms. Then they composed another represen∣tation,
in answer to the second address of the Commons,
touching their proceedings. They charged the Lower
House with want of zeal in the whole progress of this
enquiry. They produced a great number of precedents,
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
to prove that their conduct had been regular and parlia∣mentary;
and they, in their turn, accused the Commons
of partiality and injustice in vacating legal elections. The
Queen, in answer to this remonstrance, said, she looked
upon any misunderstanding between the two Houses as a
very great misfortune to the kingdom; and that she should
never omit any thing in her power to prevent all occasions
of them for the future.</P>
<P>§ VI. The Lords and Commons, animated by such
opposite principles, seised every opportunity of thwarting
each other. An action having been brought by one
Matthew Ashby against William White, and the other
constables of Aylesbury, for having denied him the privi∣lege
of voting in the last election, the cause was tried at
the assizes, and the constables were cast with damages.
But an order was given in the Queen's-Bench to quash
all the proceedings, since no action had ever been brought
on that account. The cause being moved by writ of error
into the House of Lords, was argued with great warmth:
at length it was carried by a great majority, that the order
of the Queen's-Bench should be set aside, and judgment
pronounced according to the verdict given at the assizes.
The Commons considered these proceedings as encroach∣ments
on their privileges. They passed five different reso∣lutions,
importing, That the Commons of England in
parliament assembled had the sole right to examine and
determine all matters relating to the right of election of
their own members: That the practice of determining
the qualifications of electors in any court of law would
expose all mayors, bailiffs, and returning-officers, to a
multiplicity of vexatious suits, and in supportable expenses,
and subject them to di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erent and independent jurisdictions,
as well as to inconsistent determinations in the same case,
without relief: That Matthew Ashby was guilty of a
breach of privilege, as were all attornies, sollicitors, coun∣sellors,
and serjeants at law, solliciting, prosecuting, or
pleading, in any case of the same nature. These resolu∣tions,
signed by the clerk, were fixed upon the gate of
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
Westminster-hall. On the other hand, the Lords ap∣pointed
a committee to draw up a state of the case; and,
upon their report, resolved, That every person being
wilfully hindered to exercise his right of voting, might
maintain an action in the Queen's courts against the officer
by whom his vote should be refused, to assert his right, and
recover damage for the injury: That an assertion to the
contrary was destructive of the property of the subjects,
against the freedom of elections, and manifestly tended
to the encouragement of partiality and corruption: That
the declaring Matthew Ashby guilty of a breach of privi∣lege
of the House of Commons was an unprecedented
attempt upon the judicature of parliament, and an attempt
to subject the law of England to the votes of the House of
Commons. Copies of the case, and these resolutions, were
sent by the Lord-keeper to all the sheriffs of England, to be
circulated through all the boroughs of their respective
counties.</P>
<P>§ VII. On the seventh day of February the Queen or∣dered
Secretary Hedges to tell the House of Commons,
that she had remitted the arrears of the tenths to the poor
clergy: that she would grant her whole revenue arising
out of the first-fruits and tenths, as far as it should be∣come
free from incumbrance, as an augmentation of their
maintenance: that if the House of Commons could find
any method by which her intentions to the poor clergy
might be made more effectual, it would be an advantage
to the publick, and acceptable to her Majesty. The
Commons immediately brought in a bill, enabling her to
alienate this branch of the revenue, and create a corpora∣tion
by charter, to direct the application of it to the uses
proposed: they likewise repealed the statute of Mortmain,
so far as to allow all men to bequeath by will, or grant by
deed, any sum they should think sit to give towards the
augmentation of benefices. Addresses of thanks and ac∣knowledgement
from all the elergy of England were pre∣sented
to the Queen for her gracious bounty: but very
little regard was paid to Burnet, Bishop of Sarum, al∣though
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
the Queen declared that prelate author of the
project. He was generally hated either as a Scot, a low-church-man,
or a meddling partisan.</P>
<P>§ VIII. In March an enquiry into the condition of the
navy was begun in the House of Lords. They desired
the Queen, in an address, to give speedy and effectual
orders, that a number of ships sufficient for the home-service
should be equipped and manned with all possible
expedition. They resolved, That Admiral Graydon's not
attacking the four French ships in the channel had been a
prejudice to the Queen's service, and a disgrace to the
nation: That his pressing men in Jamaica, and his seve∣rity
towards masters of merchant vessels and transports, had
been a great discouragement to the inhabitants of that
island, as well as prejudicial to her Majesty's service; and
they presented the address against him, in consequence of
which he was dismissed. They examined the accounts of
the Earl of Orford, against which great clamour had been
raised; and, taking cognizance of the remarks made by
the commissioners of the publick accounts, found them
false in fact, ill-grounded, or of no importance. The
Commons besought the Queen to order a prosecution on
account of ill practices in the Earl of Ranelagh's office;
and they sent up to the Lords a bill for continuing the
commission on the publick accounts. Some alterations
were made in the Upper House, especially in the nomina∣tion
of Commissioners; but these were rejected by the
Commons. The Peers adhering to their amendments,
the bill dropped, and the commission expired. No other
bill of any consequence passed in this session, except an
act for raising recruits, which empowered justices of the
peace to impress idle persons for soldiers and marines. On
the third day of April the Queen went to the House of
Peers, and having made a short speech on the usual topicks
of acknowledgement, unity, and moderation, prorogued
the parliament to the fourth day of July. The division
still continued between the two Houses of convocation;
so that nothing of moment was transacted in that assembly,
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
except their address to the Queen upon her granting the
first-fruits and tenths for the augmentation of small bene∣fices.
At the same time, the Lower House sent their
prolocutor with a deputation to wait upon the Speaker of
the House of Commons, to return their thanks to that
honourable House for having espoused the interest of the
clergy; and to assure them that the convocation would
pursue such methods as might best conduce to the support,
honour, interest, and security of the church as now by
law established. They sent up to the archbishop and pre∣lates
divers representations, containing complaints, and
proposing canons and articles of reformation: but very
little regard was paid to their remonstrances.</P>
<P>§ IX. About this period the Earl of Nottingham, after
having ineffectually pressed the Queen to discard the Dukes
of Somerset and Devonshire, resigned the seals. The
Earl of Jersey and Sir Edward Seymour were dismissed:
the Earl of Kent was appointed chamberlain, Harley se∣cretary
of state, and Henry St. John secretary of war.
The discovery of the Scottish conspiracy was no sooner
known in France, than Louis ordered Fraser to be im∣prisoned
in the Bastile. In England, Lindsay being sen∣tenced
to die for having corresponded with France, was
given to understand that he had no mercy to expect un∣less
he would discover the conspiracy. He persisted in
denying all knowledge of any such conspiracy; and,
scorned to save his life by giving false information. In
order to intimidate him into a confession, the ministry
ordered him to be conveyed to Tyburn, where he still
rejected life upon the terms proposed: then he was car∣ried
back to Newgate, where he remained some years: at
length he was banished, and died of hunger in Holland.
The ministers had been so lukewarm and languid in the
investigation of the Scottish conspiracy, that the Whigs
loudly exclaimed against them as disguised Jacobites, and
even whispered insinuations, implying, that the Queen
herself had a secret bias of sisterly affection for the court
of St. Germain's. What seemed to confirm this allega∣tion,
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
was the disgrace of the Duke of Queensberry, who
had exerted himself with remarkable zeal in the detection:
but the decline of his interest in Scotland was the real cause
of his being laid aside at this juncture.</P>
<P>§ X. The design of the court was to procure in the
Scottish parliament the nomination of a successor to the
crown, and the supply for the forces, which could not be
obtained in the preceding session. Secretary Johnston, in
concert with the Marquis of Tweedale, undertook to
carry these points, in return for certain limitations on the
successor, to which her Majesty agreed. The Marquis
was appointed commissioner.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> The office of lord-register
was bestowed upon Johnston;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. of Q. Anne.</NOTE> and the parliament met
on the sixth day of July.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feuquieres.</NOTE> The Queen, in her letter, ex∣pressed

the quiet and security of all her dominions, the
reputation of her affairs abroad, and the improvement of
the protestant interest through all Europe. She declared,
that she had authorised the commissioner to give the royal
assent to whatever could be reasonably demanded, and
was in her power to grant, for securing the sovereignty
and liberties of that her ancient kingdom. The remain∣ing
part of the letter turned upon the necessity of their
granting a supply, the discouragement of vice, the en∣couragement
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
of commerce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VIII. 1704.</NOTE> and the usual recommendation
of moderation and unanimity.</P>
<P>§ XI. The Duke of Hamilton presented a resolve, That
the parliament would not name a successor to the crown,
until the Scots should have concluded a previous treaty
with England, in relation to commerce and other con∣cerns.
This motion produced a warm debate, in the
course of which Fletcher of Salton expatiated upon the
hardships and miseries which the Scots had sustained since
the union of the two crowns under one sovereign, and the
impossibility of bettering their condition, unless they
should take care to anticipate any design that tended to a
continuation of the same calamities. Another resolve was
produced by the Earl of Rothes, importing, That the
parliament should proceed to make such limitations and
conditions of government as might be judged proper for
rectifying the constitution; for vindicating and securing
the sovereignty and independency of the nation; and that
then the parliament would take into consideration the
other resolve offered by the Duke of Hamilton, for a treaty
previous to the nomination of a successor. This proposal
was seconded by the court-party, and violent heats ensued.
At length, Sir James Falconer, of Phesdo, offered an
expedient, which neither party could refuse with any
show of moderation. He suggested a resolve, That the
parliament would not proceed to the nomination of a suc∣cessor,
until the previous treaty with England should be
discussed; and that it would make the necessary limita∣tions
and conditions of government, before the successor
should be nominated. This joint-resolve being put to the
vote, was carried by a great majority. The treaty with
England was neglected, and the affair of the succession
consequently postponed. The Duke of Athol moved,
That her Majesty should be desired to send down the wit∣nesses,
and all the papers relating to the conspiracy, that,
after due examination, those who were unjustly accused
might be vindicated, and the guilty punished according
to their demerits. The commissioner declared, that he
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
had already written,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK. 1. 1704.</NOTE> and would write again to the Queen
on that subject. The intention of the cavaliers was to
convict the Duke of Queensberry of malice and calumny
in the prosecution of that affair, that they might wreak
their vengeance upon him for that instance of his animo∣sity,
as well as for his having deserted them in the former
session. He found means, however, to persuade the Queen
that such an enquiry would not only protract the session,
but also divert them from the settlement of the succession,
and raise such a ferment as might be productive of tragical
consequences. Alarmed at these suggestions, she resolved
to prevent the examination; and gave no answer to the
repeated applications made by her parliament and ministers.
Mean while the Duke of Queensberry appeased his ene∣mies
in Scotland, by directing all his friends to join in the
opposition.</P>
<P>§ XII. The Duke of Hamilton again moved, That the
parliament should proceed to the limitations, and name
commissioners to treat with England, previous to all other
business, except an act for a land-tax of two months, ne∣cessary
for the immediate subsistence of the forces. The
Earl of Marchmont proposed an act to exclude all popish
successors; but this was warmly opposed an unseasonable,
by Hamilton and his party. A bill of supply being offered
by the Lord-justice Clerk, the cavaliers tacked to it great
part of the act of security, to which the royal assent had
been refused in the former session. Violent debates arose;
so that the House was filled with rage and tumult. The
national spirit of independence had been wrought up to a
dangerous pitch of enthusiasm. The streets were crowded
with people of all ranks, exclaiming against English in∣fluence;
and, threatening to sacrifice as traitors to their
country, all who should embrace measures that seemed to
favour a foregin interest. The commissioner and his friends
were confounded and appalled. Finding it impossible to
stem the torrent, he, with the concurrence of the other
ministers, wrote a letter to the Queen, representing the
uncomfortable situation of affairs, and advising her Ma∣jesty
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
to pass the bill, incumbered as it was with the act of
security. Lord Godolphin, on whose council she chiefly
relied, found himself involved in great perplexity. The
Tories had devoted him to destruction. He foresaw that
the Queen's concession to the Scots in an affair of such
consequence would furnish his enemies with a plausible
pretence to arraign the conduct of her minister: but he
chose to run that risque, rather than see the army disband∣ed
for want of a supply, and the kingdom left exposed to
an invasion. He, therefore, seconded the advice of the
Scottish ministers; and the Queen authorised the com∣missioner
to pass the bill that was depending. This act
provided, That in case of the Queen's dying without
issue, a parliament should immediately meet, and declare
the successor to the crown, different from the person posses∣sing
the throne of England, unless before that period a
settlement should be made in parliament of the rights and
liberties of the nation, independent of English councils:
by another clause, they were empowered to arm and train
the subjects, so as to put them in a posture of defence.
The Scottish parliament having, by a laudable exertion of
spirit, obtained this act of security, granted the supply
without further hesitation: but, not yet satisfied with
this sacrifice, they engaged in debates about the conspi∣racy,
and the proceedings of the House of Lords in Eng∣land,
which they termed an officious intermeddling in
their concerns, and an encroachment upon the sovereignty
and independency of the nation. They drew up an ad∣dress
to the Queen, desiring that the evidence and papers
relating to the plot might be subjected to their examination
in the next session. Mean while, the commissioner, dread∣ing
the further progress of such an ungovernable serocity,
prorogued the parliament to the seventh day of October.
The act of security being transmitted to England, copies
of it were circulated by the enemies of Godolphin, who
represented it as a measure of that minister; and the king∣dom
was filled with murmurs and discontent. People
openly declared, that the two kingdoms were now sepa∣rated
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
by law, so as never to be rejoined. Reports were
spread, that great quantities of arms had been conveyed to
Scotland, and that the natives were employed in preparati∣ons
to invade England. All the blame of these transacti∣ons
was imputed to Lord Godolphin, whom the Tories
determined to attack, while the other party resolved to
exert their whole influence for his preservation: yet in all
probability, he owned his immediate support to the success
of his friend the Duke of Marlborough.</P>
<P>§ XIII. Nothing could be more deplorable than the
situation to which the Emperor was reduced in the begin∣ning
of the season. The malcontents in Hungary had
rendered themselves formidable by their success: the
Elector of Bavaria possessed all the places on the Danube,
as far as Passau, and even threatened the city of Vienna,
which must have been infallibly lost, had the Hungarians
and Bavarians acted in concert. By the advice of Prince
Eugene, the Emperor implored the assistance of her Bri∣tannick
Majesty; and the Duke of Marlborough ex∣plained
to her the necessity of undertaking his relief. This
nobleman in the month of January had crossed the sea to
Holland, and concerted a scheme with the deputies of
the States-General, for the operations of the ensuing cam∣paign.
They agreed, that General Auverquerque should
lie upon the defensive with a small body of troops in the
Netherlands, while the main army of the allies should act
upon the Rhine, under the command of the Duke of
Marlborough. Such was the pretext under which this
consummate general concealed another plan, which was
communicated to a few only, in whose discretion he could
confide. It was approved by the Pensionary and some
leading men, who secured its <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avourable reception with the
States-General, when it became necessary to impart the
secret to that numerous assembly. In the mean time, the
preparations were made, on pretence of carrying the war
to the banks of the Mosell<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>§ XIV. In the month of April, the Duke, accompa∣nied
by his brother General Churchill, Lieutenant-Ge∣neral
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
Lumley, the Earl of Orkney, and other officers of
distinction, embarked for Holland, where he had a long
conference with a deputation of the States, concerning a
propsal of sending a large army towards the Moselle.
The deputies of Zealand opposed this measure of sending
their troops to such a distance so strenuously, that the
Duke was obliged to tell them, in plain terms, he had re∣ceived
orders to march thither with the British forces. He
accordingly assembled his army at Maestricht; and on
the eighth day of May began his march into Germany.
The French imagined his intention was to begin the
campaign with the siege of Traerbach, and penetrate into
France along the Moselle. In this persuasion they sent a
detachment to that river; and gave out that they intended
to invest Huy, a pretence to which the Duke paid no re∣gard.
He continued his route by Bedburg, Kerpenord,
Kalsecken: he visited the fortifications of Bonne, where
he received certain advice, that the recruits and re-en∣forcements
for the French army in Bavaria had joined the
Elector at Villingen. He redoubled his diligence, passed
the Neckar on the third of June, and halted at Laden∣burgh:
from thence he wrote a letter to the States Ge∣neral,
giving them to understand, that he had the Queen's
orders to march to the relief of the empire; and expressing
his hope that they would approve the design, and allow
their troops to share the honour of the expedition. By the
return of a courier he received their approbation, and full
power to command their forces. He then proceed to
Mildenheim, where he was visited by Prince Eugene; and
these two great men, whose talents were cogenial, imme∣diately
contracted an intimacy of friendship. Next day
Prince Louis of Baden arrived in the camp at Great Hip∣pach.
He told the Duke, his grace was come to save the
empire, and to give him an opportunity of vindicating his
honour, which he knew was at the last stake in the opi∣nion
of some people. The Duke replied, he was come to
learn of him how to serve the empire: that they must be
ignorant indeed, who did not know that the Prince of
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
Baden, when his health permitted him, and preserved the
empire, and extended its conquests.</P>
<P>§ XV. Those three celebrated generals agreed that the
two armies should join: that the command should be al∣ternately
vested in the Duke and Prince Louis, from day
to day; and that Prince Eugene should command a sepa∣rate
army on the Rhine. Prince Louis returned to his
army on the Danube; Prince Eugene set out for Philips∣burg;
the Duke of Marlborough being joined by the Im∣perial
army under Prince Louis of Baden, at Westertellen,
prosecuted his march by Elchingen, Gingen, and Land∣thaussen.
On the first day of July he was in sight of the
enemy's entrenchments at Dillingen, and encamped with
his right at Amerdighem, and his left at Onderingen.
Understanding that the Elector of Bavaria had detached
the best part of his infantry to re-enforce the Count
D'Arco, who was posted behind strong lines at Schellen∣berg
near Donawert, he resolved to attack their entrench∣ments
without delay. On the second day of July he ad∣vanced
towards the enemy, and passed the river Wermitz;
about five o'clock in the afternoon the attack was begun
by the English and Dutch infantry, supported by the horse
and dragoons. They were very severely handled, and even
obliged to give way, when Prince Louis of Baden march∣ing
up, at the head of the Imperialists, to another part of
the line, made a diversion in their favour. After an obsti∣nate
resistance they forced the entrenchments, and the
horse entering with the infantry, fell so furiously upon the
enemy, already disordered, that they were routed with
great slaughter. They fled with the utmost trepidation to
Donawert on the Danube, leaving six thousand men
dead on the field of battle. The confederates took sixteen
pieces of cannon, thirteen pair of colours, with all the
tents and baggage. Yet the victory was dearly purchased;
some thousands of the allies were slain in the attack, in∣cluding
many gallant officers, among whom were the
Generals Goor and Beinheim, and Count Stirum was
mortally wounded. Next day the Bavarian garrison aban∣doned
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
Donawert, of which the confederates took imme∣diate
possession, while the Elector passed the Danube in
his march to the river Leche, lest the victors should cut off
his retreat to his own country. The confederates having
crossed the Danube on several bridges of pontoons, a de∣tachment
was sent to pass the Leche, and take post in the
country of the Elector, who had retired under the cannon
of Augsburg. The garrison of Neuburg retiring to Ingol∣stadt,
the place was secured by the confederates; and the
Count de Frize was detached with nine battalions and
fifteen squadrons to invest the town of Rain. Advice ar∣riving
from Prince Eugene, that the Mareschals Villeroy
and Tallard had passed the Rhine at Fort Kehl, with an
army of five-and-forty thousand men, to succour the
Elector of Bavaria, the generals of the allies immediately
detached Prince Maximilian of Hanover, with thirty
squadrons of horse, as a re-enforcement to the Prince. In
a few days Rain surrendered, and Aicha was taken by
assault. The Emperor no sooner received a confirmation
of the victory of Schellenberg, than he wrote a letter of
acknowledgement to the Duke of Marlborough, and or∣dered
Count Wratislau to intimate his intention of invest∣ing
him with the title of prince of the empire, which the
Duke declined accepting, until the Queen interposed her
authority at the desire of Leopold.</P>
<P>§ XVI. The allies advanced within a league of Augs∣burg,
and though they sound the Elector of Bavaria too
securely posted under the cannon of that city, to be dis∣lodged
or attacked with any prospect of success, they en∣camped
with Friedburg in their centre, so as to cut off all
communication between him and his dominions. The
Duke of Marlborough having reduced him to this situa∣tion,
proposed very advantageous terms of peace, provided
he would abandon the French interest, and join the Im∣perialists
in Italy. His subjects seeing themselves at the
mercy of the allies, pressed him to comply with these
offers, rather than expose his country to ruin and desola∣tion.
A negociation was begun, and he seemed ready to
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
sign the articles, when hearing that Mareschal Tallard
had passed the Black-forest, to join him with a great body
of forces, he declared, that since the King of France had
made such powerful efforts to support him, he thought
himself obliged in honour to continue firm in his alliance.
The generals of the allies were so exasperated at this dis∣appointment,
that they sent out detachments to ravage
the country of Bavaria, as far as Munich: upwards of
three hundred towns, villages, and castles were inhu∣manly
destroyed, to the indelible disgrace of those who
countenanced and conducted such barbarous practices.
The Elector, shocked at these brutal proceedings, desired,
in a letter to the Duke of Marlborough, that a stop
might be put to acts of violence so opposite to true glory.
The answer he received implied, that it was in his own
power to put an end to them by a speedy accommodation.
Incensed at this reply, he declared, that since they had
obliged him to draw the sword, he would throw away the
scabbard. The Duke and Prince Louis, finding it im∣practicable
to attack the Elector in his strong camp, re∣solved
to undertake the siege of Ingoldstadt, and for that
purpose passed the Paer near the town of Schrobbenhausen,
where they encamped, with their left at Closterberg. On
the fifth day of August the Elector of Bavaria marched to
Biberach, where he was joined by Tallard. He resolved
to pass the Danube at Lawingen, to attack Prince Eugene,
who had followed the French army from the lines of
Biehl, and lay encamped at Hochstadt. Next day, how∣ever,
he made a motion that disappointed the enemy.
Nevertheless, they persisted in their design of passing the
Danube, and encamping at Bl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nheim. The allies re∣solved
that Prince Louis should undertake the siege of
Ingoldstadt, whilst Prince Eugen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the Duke should
observe the Elector of Bavaria. Advice being received
that he had actually crossed the Danube at Lawingen, the
Duke of Marlborough joined the forces of Prince Eugene
at the camp of Munster on the eleventh day of August,
Prince Louis having by this time marched off towards the
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
place he intended to besiege. Next day the Duke of
Marlborough and Prince Eugene observed the posture of
the enemy, who were advantageously posted on a hill near
Hochstadt, their right being covered by the Danube and
the village of Blenheim, their left by the village of Lut∣zengen,
and their front by a rivulet, the banks of which
were steep, and the bottom marshy.</P>
<P>§ XVII. Notwithstanding these difficulties, the generals
resolved to attack them immediately, rather than lie in∣active
until their forage and provision should be consumed.
They were moreover stimulated to this hazardous enter∣prise,
by an intercepted letter to the Elector of Bavaria
from Mareschal Villeroy, giving him to understand, that
he had received orders to ravage the county of Wirtem∣berg,
and intercept all communication between the Rhine
and the allied army. The dispositions being made for the
attack, and the orders communicated to the general
officers, the forces advanced into the plain on the thir∣teenth
day of August, and were ranged in order of battle.
The cannonading began about nine in the morning and
continued on both sides till one in the afternoon. The
French and Bavarians amounted to about sixty thousand
men. Mareschal Tallard commanded on the right, and
posted seven-and-twenty battalions, with twelve squadrons,
in the village of Blenheim, supposing that there the allies
would make their chief effort: their left was conducted by
the Elector of Bavaria, assisted by Marsin, a French ge∣neral
of experience and capacity. The number of the
confederates did not exceed five-and-fifty: their right was
under the direction of Prince Eugene, and their left com∣manded
by the Duke of Marlborough. At noon the
action was begun by a body of English and Hessians,
under Major-General Wilkes, who having passed the
rivulet with difficulty, and filed off to the left in the face
of the enemy, attacked the village of Blenheim with great
vigour; but were repulsed after three successive attempts.
Mean while the troops in the centre, and part of the right
wing, passed the rivulet on planks in different places;
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
and formed on the other side without any molestation from
the enemy. At length, however, they were charged by
the French horse with such impetuosity, and so terribly
galled in flank by the troops posted at Blenheim, that they
fell in disorder, and part of them repassed the rivulet: but
a re-enforcement of dragoons coming up, the French ca∣valry
were broke in their turn, and driven to the very
hedges of the village of Blenheim. The left wing of the
confederates being now completely formed, ascended the
hill in a firm compacted body, charging the enemy's
horse, which could no longer stand their ground, but ral∣lied
several times as they gave way. Tallard, in order to
make a vigorous effort, ordered ten battalions to fill up
the intervals of his cavalry. The Duke, perceiving his de∣sign,
sent three battalions of the troops of Zell to sustain
his horse. Nevertheless, the line was a little disordered by
the prodigious fire from the French infantry, and even ob∣liged
to recoil about sixty paces: but the confederates
advancing to the charge with redoubled ardour, routed
the French horse; and their battalions being thus aban∣doned,
were cut in pieces. Tallard, having rallied his
broken cavalry behind some tents that were still standing,
resolved to draw off the troops he had posted in the village
of Blenheim, and sent an aide-du-camp to Marsin, who
was with the Elector of Bavaria on the left, to desire he
would face the confederates with some troops to the right
of the village of Oberklau, so as to keep them in play,
and favour the retreat of the forces from Blenheim. That
officer assured him, he was so far from being in a condi∣tion
to spare troops, that he could hardly maintain his
ground. The fate of the day was now more than half
decided. The French cavalry being vigorously attacked in
flank were totally defeated. Part of them endeavoured to
gain the bridge which they had thrown over the Danube
between Hochstadt and Blenheim; but they were so closely
pursued, that those who escaped the slaughter threw them∣selves
into the river, where they perished. Tallard, being
surrounded, was taken near a mill behind the village of
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
Sonderen, together with the Marquis de Montperouz,
general of horse, the Major-Generals de Seppeville,
de Silly, de la Valiere, and many other officers of distinc∣tion.
Whilst these occurrences passed on the left wing,
Marsin's quarters at the village of Oberklau, in the centre,
were attacked by ten battalions, under the Prince of Hol∣stein-beck,
who passed the rivulet with undaunted resolu∣tion:
but before he could form his men on the other
side, he was overpowered by numbers, mortally wounded,
and taken prisoner. His battalions being supported by
some Danish and Hanoverian cavalry, renewed the charge,
and were again repulsed: at length, the Duke of Marl∣borough
in person brought up some fresh squadrons from
the body of reserve, and compelled the enemy to retire.
By this time Prince Eugene had obliged the left wing of
the enemy to give ground, after having surmounted a great
number of difficulties, sustained a very obstinate opposi∣tion,
and seen his cavalry, in which his chief strength
seemed to lie, three times repulsed. The Duke of Marl∣borough
had no sooner defeated the right wing, than he
made a disposition to re-enforce the Prince, when he un∣derstood
from an aide-du-camp, that his highness had no
occasion for assistance; and that the Elector, with Mon∣sieur
de Marsin had abandoned Oberklau and Lutzingen.
They were pursued as far as the villages of Morselingen
and Teissenhoven, from whence they retreated to Dillingen
and Lawingen. The confederates being now masters of
the filed of battle, surrounded the village of Blenheim, in
which, as we have already observed, seven-and-twenty
battalions and twelve squadrons were posted. These
troops, seeing themselves cut off from all communication
with the rest of their army, and despairing of being able
to force their way through the allies, capitulated about
eight in the evening, laid down their arms, delivered
their colours and standards, and surrendered themselves
prisoners of war, on condition that the officers should
not be rifled. This was one of the most glorious and
complete victories that ever was obtained. Ten thou∣sand
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
French and Bavarians were left dead on the field of
battle: the greater part of thirty squarons of horse and
dragoons perished in the river Danube: thirteen thousand
were made prisoners: one hundred pieces of cannon were
taken, with twenty-four mortars, one hundred and twenty-nine
colours, one hundred and seventy-one standards,
seventeen pair of kettle-drums, three thousand six hundred
tents, four-and-thirty coaches, three hundred laden mules,
two bridges of boats, fifteen pontoons, fifteen barrels and
eight casks filled with silver. Of the allies, about four
thousand five hundred men were killed, and about eight
thousand wounded or taken. The loss of the battle was
imputed to two capital errors committed by Mareschal
Tallard; namely, his weakening the centre, by detaching
such a number of troops to the village of Blenheim, and
his suffering the confederates to pass the rivulet, and form
unmolested. Certain it is, these circumstances contri∣buted
to the success of the Duke of Marlborough, who
rode through the hottest of the fire with the calmest intre∣pidity,
giving his orders with that presence of mind and
deliberation which were so peculiar to his character. When
he next day visited Tallard, he told that general, he was
sorry such a misfortune should happen personally to one
for whom he had a profound esteem. The Mareschal con∣gratulated
him on having vanquished the best troops in the
world; a compliment to which the Duke replied, That
he thought his own the best troops in the world, seeing they
had conquered those upon whom the Mareschal had be∣stowed
such an encomium.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. The victorious generals having by this decisive
stroke saved the House of Austria from entire ruin, and
entirely changed the face of affairs in the empire, signified
their opinion to Prince Louis of Baden, that it would be
for the advantage of the common cause to join all their
forces, and drive the French out of Germany, rather than
lose time at the siege of Ingoldstadt, which would surrender
of course. This opinion was confirmed by the conduct of
the French garrison at Augsburg, who quitted that place
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
on the sixteenth day of August. The magistrates sent a
deputation, craving the protection of the Duke of Marl∣borough,
who forthwith ordered a detachment to take
possession of that important city. The Duke having sent
Mareschal de Tallard under a guard of dragoons to Frank∣fort,
and disposed of the other prisoners of distinction in
the adjacent places, encamped at Sesillingen, within half
a league of Ulm. Here he held a conference with the
Princes Eugene and Louis of Baden, in which they
agreed that, as the enemy retreated towards the Rhine,
the confederate army should take the same route, excepting
three-and-twenty battalions and some squadrons, to be left
for the siege of Ulm, under General Thungen. They
began their march on the twenty-sixth day of August, by
different routes, to the general rendezvous at Bruschai,
near Philipsburg. Then they resolved, that Prince Louis
of Baden should undertake the siege of Landau, in order
to secure the circle of Suabia from the incursions of that
garrison. Considering the consternation that prevailed all
over France, nothing could be more impolitick than this
measure, which gave the enemy time for recollection, and
recruiting their forces. It was a proposal on which the
Prince of Baden insisted with uncommon obstinacy. He
was even suspected of corruption. He was jealous of the
glory which the Duke of Marlborough had acquired, and
such a bigoted papist, that he repined at the success of an
heretical general. On the twelfth day of September he
marched towards Landau with the troops destined for the
siege, and the Duke of Marlborough, with Prince Eugene,
encamped at Croon Weissenburg, to cover the enterprise.
By this time Ulm had surrendered to Thungen, even be∣fore
the trenches were opened. Villeroy advanced with
his army towards Landau, as if he had intended to attack
the confederates: but he retired without having made any
attempt for the relief of the place, which was desended
with the most obstinate valour till the twenty-third day of
November, when the besiegers having lodged themselves
on the counterscarps, the breaches being practicable, and
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
the dispositions made for a general assault, the garrison
capitulated upon honourable conditions. The King of the
Romans had arrived in the camp, that he might have the
credit of taking the place, the command of which he be∣stowed
on the Count de Frize, who had before defended it
with equal courage and ability.</P>
<P>§ XIX. The next enterprise which the confederates
undertook, was the siege of Traerbach. The Hereditary
Prince of Hesse-Cassel being entrusted with the direction
of the attacks, invested the castle in the beginning of No∣vember.
Though it was strongly fortified, and well de∣fended,
he carried on his operations with such spirit and
assiduity, that in about six weeks the garrison surrendered
the place on honourable terms. In the mean time the
Duke of Marlborough repaired to Berlin, where he ne∣gociated
for a re-enforcement of eight thousand Prussians,
to serve under Prince Eugene in Italy during the next
campaign. Thence he proceeded to the court of Hanover,
where, as in all other places, he was received with parti∣cular
marks of distinction. When he arrived at the Hague,
he was congratulated by the States-General on his victories
at Schellenberg and Blenheim, and as much considered
in Holland as if he had been actually stadtholder. He had
received a second letter from the Emperor, couched in the
warmest terms of acknowledgement, and was declared
prince of the empire. In December he embarked for
England, where he found the people in a transport of joy,
and was welcomed as a hero who had retrieved the glory of
the nation.</P>
<P>§ XX. In Flanders, nothing of moment was executed,
except the bombardment of Bruges and Namur by Baron
Spaar, with nine thousand Dutch troops; and two at∣tempts
upon the French lines, which were actually pene∣trated
by Auverquerque, though he was not able to main∣tain
the footing he had gained. The Elector of Bavaria,
who had retired to Brussels after his defeat, formed a
scheme for surprising the Dutch general at the end of the
campaign, and assembled all his troops at Tirlemont: but
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
the French court, apprehensive of his temerity, sent
Villeroy to watch his conduct, and prevent his hazarding
an engagement, except with a fair prospect of advantage.
The Mareschal, finding him determined to give battle at
all events, represented the improbability of succeeding
against an enemy so advantageously posted; and the ill
consequences of a repulse: but, finding the Elector deaf
to all his remonstrances, he flatly refused to march, and
produced the King's order to avoid an engagement. In
Italy the French met with no opposition. The Duke of
Savoy, being unable to face the enemy in the field, was
obliged to lie inactive. He saw the Duke de Vendome
reduce Vercelli and Ivrea, and undertake the siege of
Verac; while he posted his little army on the other side of
the Po, at Crescentino, where he had a bridge of commu∣nication,
by which he supplied the place occasionally with
fresh troops and provision. The place held out five
months, against all the efforts of the French general: at
length, the communication being cut off, the Duke of
Savoy retired to Chivas. He bore his misfortunes with
great equanimity; and told the English minister, that
though he was abandoned by the allies, he would never
abandon himself. The Emperor had neglected Italy, that
he might act with more vigour against Ragotski and the
Hungarian malcontents, over whom he obtained several
advantages; notwithstanding which they continued for∣midable,
from their number, bravery, and resolution.
The ministers of the allies pressed Leopold to enter into a
negociation for a peace with those rebels; and conferences
were opened; but he was not sincerely disposed to an ac∣commodation,
and Ragotski aimed at the principality of
Transylvania, which the court of Vienna would not easily
relinquish. The Emperor was not a little alarmed by a
revolution at the Ortoman Porte, until the new sultan
dispatched a chiaus to Vienna, with an assurance that he
would give no assistance to the malcontents of Hungary.
In Poland, the diet being assembled by the Cardinal-Pri∣mate,
Stanislaus Lezinski, Palatine of Posnania, was
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
elected and proclaimed king, and recognized by Charles of
Sweden, who still maintained his army by contributions
in that country, more intent upon the ruin of Augustus
than upon the preservation of his own dominions; for he
paid no regard to the progress of the Muscovites, who had
ravaged Livonia, reduced Narva, and made incursions
into Sweden. Augustus retreated into his Saxon domi∣nions,
which he impoverished, in order to raise a great
army, with which he might return to Poland: the Pope
espoused the interest of this new convert, so far as to cite
the Cardinal-Primate to appear at Rome, and give an ac∣count
of the share he had in the Polish troubles. The
protestants of the Cevennois, deriving courage from despair,
became so troublesome to the government of France, that
Louis was obliged to treat them with lenity; he sent
Mareschal Villars against them with a fresh re-enforcement;
but at the same time furnished him with instructions to treat
for an accommodation. This officer immediately com∣menced
a negociation with Cavalier, the chief of the re∣volters;
and a formal treaty was concluded, by which they
were indulged with liberty of conscience; but these arti∣cles
were very ill observed by the French ministry.</P>
<P>§ XXI. In Portugal, the interest of King Charles wore
a very melancholy aspect. When he arrived at Lisbon,
he found no preparations made for opening the campaign.
The Portuguese ministry favoured the French in secret;
the people were averse to heretics; the Duke of Schom∣berg
was on ill terms with Fagel, the Dutch general; the
Portuguese forces consisted of raw undisciplined peasants;
and the French ambassadour had bought up the best horses
in the kingdom; so that the troopers could not be properly
mounted. The King of Portugal had promised to enter
Spain with Charles by the middle of May; but he was
not ready till the beginning of June, when they reached
Santaren. By this time they had published their respective
manifestoes; Charles displaying his title to the crown of
Spain, and promising pardon to all his subjects who should
in three months join his army; and the King of Portugal
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
declaring, that his sole aim in taking up arms was to re∣store
the liberty of the Spanish nation, oppressed by the
power of France, as well as to assert the right of Charles
to that monarchy. The present possessor, whom they
mentioned by the name of the Duke of Anjou, had already
anticipated their invasion. His general, the Duke of Ber∣wick,
entering Portugal, took the town of Segura by
stratagem. The governor of Salva-terra surrendered at
discretion; Cebreros was reduced without much opposi∣tion;
Zebredo was abandoned by the inhabitants; and
the town of Lhana la Viella was taken by assault. Por∣tugal
was at the same time invaded in different parts by the
Marquis de Jeoffreville, Prince Tserclaes de Tilly, and
the Marquis de Villadarias. Two Dutch battalions were
attacked and taken by the Duke of Berwick at Sodreira
Formosa. Then he passed the Tagus, and joined Prince
Tserclaes. King Philip arriving in the army, invested
Portalegre; and the garrison, including an English regi∣ment
of foot commanded by Colonel Stanhope, were made
prisoners of war. The next place he besieged was Castel
Davide, which met with the same fate. On the other
hand, the Marquis Das Minas, in order to make a diver∣sion,
entered Spain with fifteen thousand men, took Fuente
Grimaldo, in Castile, by assault, defeated a body of French
and Spaniards commanded by Don Ronquillo, and made
himself master of Manseinto. The weather growing ex∣cessively
hot, Philip sent his troops into quarters of re∣freshment;
and the allies followed his example. Duke
Schomberg finding his advice very little regarded by the
Portuguese ministry, and seeing very little prospect of suc∣cess,
desired leave to resign his command, which the
Queen bestowed upon the Earl of Galway, who, with a
re-enforcement of English and Dutch troops, arrived at
Lisbon on the thirteenth day of July. About the latter end
of September, the two Kings repaired to the camp near
Almeda, resolving to invade Castile; but they sound the
river Agueda so well guarded by the Duke of Berwick,
that they would not attempt a passage. They, therefore,
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
retired into the territories of Portugal, and the army was
put into winter-quarters. The Spaniards were now so
weakened, by detachments sent with the Marquis de Villa∣darias
towards Gibraltar, that the Duke of Berwick could
not execute any scheme of importance during the remain∣ing
part of the campaign.</P>
<P>§ XXII. The arms of England were not less fortunate
by sea than they had been upon the Danube. Sir George
Rooke having landed King Charles at Lisbon, sent a
squadron to cruise off Cape Spartell, under the command
of Rear-Admiral Dilkes, who, on the twelfth of March,
engaged and took three Spanish ships of war, bound from
St. Sebastian's to Cadiz. Rooke received orders from the
Queen to sail to the relief of Nice and Villa Franca,
which were threatened with a siege by the Duke de Ven∣dome:
at the same time he was pressed by King Charles
to execute a scheme upon Barcelona, projected by the
Prince of Hesse d'Armstadt, who declared his opinion,
that the Catalonians would declare for the house of
Austria, as soon as they should be assured of proper sup∣port
and protection. The ministry of England under∣standing
that the French were employed in equipping a
strong squadron at Brest, and judging it was destined to
act in the Mediterranean, sent out Sir Cloudesley Shovel
with a considerable fleet, to watch the motions of the
Brest squadron; and he was provided with instructions
how to act, in case it should be sailed to the Mediterra∣nean.
Mean while, Sir George Rooke, in compliance
with the entreaties of King Charles, sailed with the
transports under his convoy to Barcelona, and on the
eighteenth of May appeared before the city. Next day,
the troops were landed by the Prince of Hesse, to the
number of two thousand, and the Dutch ketches bom∣barded
the place; but by this time the governor had
secured the chiefs of the Austrian party; and the people
exhibiting no marks of attachment to King Charles, the
Prince re-embarked his soldiers, from an apprehension of
their being attacked and overpowered by superior numbers.
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
On the sixteenth day of June Sir George Rooke, being
joined by Sir Cloudesley Shovel, resolved to proceed up
the Mediterranean in quest of the French fleet, which had
sailed thither from Brest, and which Rooke had actually
discovered, in the preceding month, on their voyage to
Toulon. On the seventeenth day of July the Admiral
called a council of war in the road of Tetuan, when they
resolved to make an attempt upon Gibraltar, which was
but slenderly provided with a garrison. Thither they sail∣ed,
and on the twenty-first day of the month the Prince
of Hesse landed on the isthmus with eighteen hundred
marines; then he summoned the governor to surrender,
and was answered, that the place would be defended to
the last extremity. Next day the Admiral gave orders for
cannonading the town: perceiving that the enemy were
driven from their fortifications at the south mole-head, he
commanded Captain Whitaker to arm all the boats, and
assault that quarter. The Captains Hicks and Jumper,
who happened to be nearest the mole, immediately manned
their pinnaces, and entered the fortifications sword in hand.
The Spaniards sprung a mine, by which two lieutenants,
and about a hundred men, were killed or wounded. Ne∣vertheless,
the two Captains took possession of a platform,
and kept their ground until they were sustained by Captain
Whitaker, and the rest of the seamen, who took by storm
a redoubt between the mole and the town. Then the
governour capitulated; and the Prince of Hesse entered
the place, amazed at the success of this attempts, consider∣ing
the strength of the fortifications, which might have
been defended by fifty men against a numerous army.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. A sufficient garrison being left with his
Highness, the Admiral returned to Tetuan, to take in
wood and water; and when he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailed, on the ninth day
of August, he deseried the French sleet, to which he gave
chase with all the sail he could spread. On the thirteenth
he came up with it, as it lay in a line off Malaga ready
to receive him, to the number of two-and-fifty great ships,
and four-and-twenty galleys, under the command of the
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
Count de Tholouse, high-admiral of France, with the
inferior flags of the white and blue divisions. The English
fleet consisted of three-and-fifty ships of the line, exclusive
of frigates; but they were inferior to the French in number
of guns and men, as well as in weight of metal, and alto∣gether
unprovided of gallies, from which the enemy
reaped great advantage during the engagement. A little
after ten in the morning the battle began, with equal fury
on both sides, and continued to rage with doubtful suc∣cess
till two in the afternoon, when the van of the French
gave way; nevertheless, the fight was maintained till
night, when the enemy bore away to leeward. The wind
shifting before morning the French gained the weather∣gage;
but they made no use of this advantage: for two
successive days the English admiral endeavoured to renew
the engagement, which the Count de Tholouse declined,
and at last he disappeared. The loss was pretty equal on
both sides, though not a single ship was taken or destroyed
by either; but the honour of the day certainly remained
with the English. Over and above the disadvantages we
have enumerated, the bottoms of the British fleet were
foul, and several large ships had expended all their shot
long before the battle ceased: yet the enemy were so
roughly handled, that they did not venture another en∣gagement
during the whole war. The French King, in
order to raise the drooping spirits of his people, claimed
the victory, and published an account of the action, which,
at this distance of time, plainly proves that he was reduced
to the mean shift of imposing upon his subjects, by false
and partial representations. Among other exaggerations
in this detail, we find mention made of mischief done to
French ships by English bombs; though nothing is more
certain than that there was not one bomb-vessel in the
combined fleet. The French academy, actuated by a
servile spirit of adulation, caused a medal to be struck on
the occasion, which, instead of perpetuating the glory of
their prince, serves only to transmit their own shame to
posterity. After the battle, Sir George Rooke sailed to
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
Gibraltar to resit, and leaving a squadron with Sir John
Leake, set sail for England on the twenty-fourth day of
August. He arrived in September, and was received by
the ministry, and the people in general, with those marks
of esteem and veneration which were due to his long ser∣vices
and signal success; but he was still persecuted with
a spirit of envy and detraction. Philip King of Spain,
alarmed at the reduction of Gibraltar, sent the Marquis
de Villadarias with an army to retake it. The siege lasted
four-months, during which the Prince of Hesse exhibited
many shining proofs of courage and ability. The place
was supplied with men and provisions by convoys from
Lisbon, until Monsieur de Pointis put a stop to that com∣munication,
by entering the bay with a strong squadron:
but he was obliged to retire at the approach of Sir John
Leake and Admiral Vanderdussen; and the Marquis de
Villadarias having made little or no progress on land,
thought proper to abandon the enterprise.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. The parliament of England meeting on the
twenty-ninth day of October, the Queen, in her speech,
observed that the great and remarkable success with
which God had blessed her arms produced unanimous
joy and satisfaction through all parts of the kingdom; and
that a timely improvement of the present advantages
would enable her to procure a lasting foundation of secu∣rity
for England, as well as a firm support for the liberty
of Europe. She declared her intention was to be kind
and indulgent to all her subjects. She expressed her hope
that they would do nothing to endanger the loss of this
opportunity; and that there would be no contention among
them, but an emulation to promote the publick welfare.
Congratulatory addresses were voted and presented by both
Houses. They were equal in their professions of duty and
affection to the Queen; but the addresses imbibed a very
different colour from the different factions by which the
two Houses were influenced. The Lords congratulated
her on the great and glorious success of her arms under
the command of the Duke of Marlborough, without
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
deigning to mention Sir George Rooke, who had defeated
the French navy at sea, and added the important fortress
of Gibraltar to the British conquests. On the other hand,
the Commons affected to mention the battle of Blenheim,
and Rooke's naval victory, as events of equal glory and
importance. However they might be warped by prejudice
against individuals, they did not suffer the war to languish
for want of supplies. Having taken into consideration the
services of the army and navy, they voted that the Queen
should be desired to bestow her bounty on the seamen and
land-forces who had behaved themselves so gallantly.
Then they deliberated upon the different articles of na∣tional
expense, and granted four millions six hundred and
seventy thousand, nine hundred, and thirty-one pounds,
for the occasions of the ensuing year, to be raised by a
land-tax, by the sale of annuities, and other expedients.
These measures were taken with such expedition, that the
land-tax received the royal assent on the ninth day of De∣cember;
when the Queen, in a short speech, thanked the
Commons for their dispatch, which she considered as a
sure pledge of their affection.</P>
<P>§ XXV. The high-church party took this occasion to
promote the bill against occasional conformity, which was
revived and brought into the House on a new model, by
Mr. William Bromley, who moved that it might be
tacked to the land-tax bill, and sent up to the Lords for
their concurrence. The court no longer espoused this
measure; and the violent party was weakened by defec∣tion.
After a warm and tedious debate, the tack was
rejected by a great majority. The bill, however, passed
the House of Commons, and was sent up to the Lords on
the fourteenth day of December, when it would hardly
have excited a debate, had not the Queen been present
and desirous of hearing what could be said on both sides of
the question. For the information and satisfaction of her
Majesty the subject was again discussed, and all the argu∣ments
being repeated, the bill was rejected by a majority
of one-and-twenty voices. The next subject on which the
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
House of Lords employed their attention, was the late
conduct of the Scottish parliament. The Lord Haversham,
in a set speech, observed, that the settlement of the suc∣cession
in Scotland had been postponed, partly because the
ministry for that kingdom were weak and divided; partly
from a received opinion that the succession was never sin∣cerely
and cordially intended by those who managed the
affairs of Scotland in the cabinet-council. He expatiated
on the bad consequences that might attend the act of se∣curity,
which he stiled a bill of exclusion; and particu∣larly
mentioned that clause by which the heritors and
boroughs were ordained to exercise their sensible men every
month. He said the nobility and gentry of Scotland were
as learned and brave as any nation in Europe, and gene∣rally
discontented: that the common people were very
numerous, very stout, and very poor; and he asked who
was the man that could tell what such a multitude, so
armed, and so disciplined, might do under such leaders,
could opportunities suit their intention? He recommended
these circumstances to the consideration of the House, and
concluded with these words of Lord Bacon, “Let men
beware how they neglect or suffer matter of troubles to
be prepared: for no man can forbid the sparks that may
set all on fire.” The Lords resolved to consider these
subjects on the twenty-ninth day of November, when the
Queen repaired to the House of Peers to hear the debates,
and by her presence moderate the heat of both parties.
The Earl of Nottingham reflected so severely on the me∣mory
of King William, that he would have been sent to
the Tower, had not the Lords declined any such motion
out of respect to her Majesty. After much declamation on
the Scottish act of security, the grand committee of the
Peers, by the advice of Lord Wharton, resolved, That
the Queen should be enabled, by act of parliament on the
part of England, to name commissioners to treat about an
union with Scotland, provided that the parliament of
Scotland should first appoint commissioners on the two
for the same purpose: That no Scotsmen should<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed. A <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="36" REF="40"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="37" REF="41"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="38" REF="42"/>
privileges of Englishmen, except such as were settled in
England, Ireland, and the plantations, and such as were
or might be in the sea or land-service, until an union
could be effected, or the succession settled as in England:
That the traffick by cattle from Scotland to England
should be prevented: That the Lord-Admiral should issue
orders for taking such vessels as should be found trading
from Scotland to France, or to the ports of any of her
Majesty's enemies; and that care should be taken to pre∣vent
the exportation of English wool into Scotland. On
these resolutions a bill was formed for an entire union,
and passed the House on the twentieth day of December.
The Lords presented an address to the Queen, represent∣ing
that they had duly weighed the dangerous and perni∣cious
effects that were likely to be produced by divers acts
of parliament lately passed in Scotland: That they were
of opinion the safety of the kingdom required that speedy
and effectual orders should be given to put Newcastle in
a posture of defence, to secure the port of Tinmouth, and
repair the fortifications of Hull and Carlisle. They like∣wise
advised her Majesty to give directions for disciplining
the militia of the four northern counteis; for providing
them with arms and ammunition; for maintaining a com∣petent
number of regular troops on the northern borders
of England, as well as in the north of Ireland; and for
putting the laws in execution against papists. The Queen
promised that a survey shold be made of the places they
had mentioned, and laid before the parliament; and that
she would give the necessary directions upon the other arti∣cles
of the address. The Commons seemed to concur
with the Lords in their sentiments of the Scottish act of
security. They resolved, That a bill should be brought
in for the effectual securing the kingdom of England from
the apparent dangers that might arise from several acts
lately passed in the parliament of Scotland; and this was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on nearly the same resolutions which had been
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Upper House. The bill sent down by the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> thrice read, and ordered to lie upon the table;
<PB N="39" REF="43"/>
but they passed their own, to take effect at Christmas,
provided before that time the Scots should not settle the
succession. When it was offered to the Lords, they passed
it without any amendment, contrary to the expectation,
and even to the hope, of some members who were no
friends to the house of Hanover, and firmly believed the
Lords would have treated this bill with the same contempt
which had been manifested for that which they had sent
down to the Commons.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. The Duke of Marlborough, at his first ap∣pearance
in the House after his return to England, was
honoured with a very extraordinary eulogium, pronounced
by the Lord-Keeper, in the name of the Peers of England;
and a compliment of the same nature was presented to him
by a committee of the House of Commons. Doctor De∣laune,
vice-chancellor of Oxford, accompanied by the
principal members of the university, attended the Queen
with an address of congratulation upon the success of her
arms in Germany, under the admirable conduct and in∣vincible
courage of the Duke of Marlborough; and at sea,
under the most brave and faithful Admiral Sir George
Rooke. He received a civil answer from her Majesty,
though now she took umbrage at Rooke's being raised
upon a level with the Duke of Marlborough, whose great
victories had captivated her admiration, and whose wife
had alienated her affection from the Tories. The Com∣mons
perceiving how high he stood in her Majesty's esteem,
and having been properly tutored for the purpose, took
into consideration the great services of the Duke; and, in
an address, besought her Majesty to consider some proper
means to perpetuate the memory of such noble actions. In
a few days she gave them to understand by a message, that
she was inclined to grant the interest of the crown in the
honour and manour of Woodstock and hundred of Wooton
to the Duke of Marlborough and his heirs; and that as the
lieutenancy and rangership of the parks, with the rents and
profits of the manours and hundreds, were granted for two
lives, she wished that incumberance could be removed. A
<PB N="40" REF="44"/>
bill was immediately brought in, enabling the Queen to
bestow these honours and manours on the Duke of Marl∣borough
and his heirs; and the Queen was desired to ad∣vance
the money for clearing the incumberances. She not
only complied with this address, but likewise ordered the
comptroller of her works to build, in Woodstock-park, a
magnificent palace for the Duke, upon a plan much more
solid than beautiful. By this time Sir George Rooke was
laid aside, and the command of the sleet bestowed upon
Sir Cloudesley Shovel, now declared rear-admiral of Eng∣land.
Mareschal de Tallard, with the other French ge∣nerals
taken at Hochstadt, arrived on the sixteenth of De∣cember
in the River Thames, and were immediatly con∣veyed
to Nottingham and Lichfield, attended by a detach∣ment
of the royal regiment of horse-guards. They were
treated with great respect, and allowed the privilege of
riding ten miles around the places of their confinement.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. While the House of Commons, in two
successive addresses, thanked the Queen for the treaty
which the Duke of Marlborough had concluded with
Prussia, concerning the troops to be sent to the Duke of
Savoy; and desired she would use her interest with the
allies, that they might next year furnish their complete
proportions of men by sea and land; the Lords examined
into all the proceedings at sea, and all the instructions of
the Admiralty; and presented an address to the Queen,
explaining all the different articles of mismanagement.
She promised to consider them particularly, and give such
directions upon them as might be most for the advantage
of the publick service. The remaining part of the
session was consumed in disputes and altercations between
the two Houses on the subject of the Aylesbury consta∣bles,
who were sued by five other inhabitants for having
denied them the right of voting at the election. These
five persons were committed to Newgate by order of the
House of Commons. They moved for a habeas corpus in
the King's-Bench; but the court would take no cogni∣zance
of the affair. Two of the prisoners petitioned the
<PB N="41" REF="45"/>
Queen that their case might be brought before her Ma∣jesty
in parliament. The Commons, in an address, be∣sought
the Queen to refuse granting a writ of error in this
case, which would tend to the overthrowing the undoubted
rights and privileges of the Commons of England. She
assured them she would not do any thing to give them just
cause of complaint; but this matter relating to the course
of judicial proceedings, being of the highest importance,
she thought it necessary to weigh and consider very care∣fully
what might be proper for her to do in a thing of so
great concern. They voted all the lawyers who had
pleaded on the return of the habeas corpus in behalf of the
prisoners guilty of a breach of privilege, and ordered them
to be taken into custody. They likewise ordered the pri∣soners
to be removed from Newgate into the custody of
their serjeant at arms, lest they should have been dis∣charged
by the Queen's granting writs of error. The pri∣soners,
finding themselves at the mercy of the exasperated
Commons, petitioned the Lords for relief. The Upper
House passed six different resolutions against the conduct of
the Commons, as being an obstruction to justice, and
contrary to magna charta. The Lower House demanded
a conference, in which they insisted upon the sole right of
determining elections: they affirmed, that they only could
judge who had a right of voting; and that they were
judges of their own privileges, in which the Lords could
not intermeddle.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. The Upper House demanded a free con∣ference,
which proved ineffectual. New resolutions were
taken by the Commons, diametrically opposite to those of
the Peers, who, on the other hand, attended the Queen
with a long representation of all the particulars relating to
this affair. They assirmed that the proceedings of the
House of Commons against the Aylesbury men were
wholly new and unprecedented: that it was the birthright
of every Englishman, who apprehended himself injured,
to seek for redress in her Majesty's courts of justice: that
if any power could control this right, and prescribe when
<PB N="42" REF="46"/>
he should, and when he should not, be allowed the benefit
of the laws, he ceased to be a freeman, and his liberty and
property were precarious. They requested, therefore
that no consideration whatever should prevail with her
Majesty to suffer an obstruction to the known course of
justice; but that she would be pleased to give effectual
orders for the immediate issuing of the writs of error.
The Queen assured them that she should have complied
with their request; but, finding an absolute necessity for
putting an immediate end to this session, she knew there
could be no further proceedings on that matter. On that
very day, which was the fourteenth of March, she went
to the House of Lords, and passed the bills that were ready
for the royal assent. Then she thanked the parliament for
having dispatched the publick business: she warned them
to avoid the fatal effects of animosity and dissention; and
ordered the Lord Keeper to prorogue them to Thursday
the first of May:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> but on the fifth of April they were dis∣solved
by proclamation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. of Eu∣rope.</NOTE> and another was published for
calling a new parliament.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tindal.</NOTE> The Queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. of the D. of Marl∣borough.</NOTE> accompanied by

and afterwards dined by invitation with the uni∣versity

celebrated Isaac Newton mathematical professor.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feuquieres.</NOTE> The
two Houses of Convocation still continued at variance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Voltaire.</NOTE>
The Lower House penned petulant representations; and
the Archbishop answered them by verbal reprehension and
admonition. The Tory interest was now in the wane.
The Duke of Buckinghamshire was deprived of the privy-seal,
and that office conferred upon the Duke of New-castle,
a nobleman of powerful influence with the Whig
party. The Earl of Montague was created Marquis of
Mounthermer and Duke of Montague: the Earl of Pe∣terborough
and Lord Cholmondley were chosen of the
privy-council; and Lord Cutts was sent to command the
croops in Ireland, under the Duke of Ormond.</P>

§ XXIX. The ministry of Scotland was now entirely
changed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VIII. 1705.</NOTE> The Marquis of Tweedale and Johnston, hav∣ing
been found unequal to the undertaking, were dismissed.
The Duke of Queensberry resumed the management of
affairs in that kingdom, under the title of lord privy-seal;
and the office of commissioner was conferred upon the
young Duke of Argyle, who succeeded to his father's in∣fluence
among the presbyterians. He was a nobleman
possessed of good natural talents which had not been
neglected; candid, open, and sincere, brave, passionate,
and aspiring: had he been endued with a greater share of
liberality, his character would have been truely heroick.
At this juncture he was instructed to procure an act of the
Scottish parliament settling the protestant succession; or
to set on foot a treaty for the union of the two kingdoms.
At the opening of the session in June the members were
divided into three parties, namely, the Cavaliers or Jaco∣bites,
the Revolutioners, the squadrone volante, or flying
squadron, headed by the Marquis of Tweedale, who dis∣claimed
the other two factions, and pretended to act from
the dictates of conscience alone. The parliament was
adjourned to the third day of July, when her Majesty's
letter was read, earnestly recommending the settlement of
the succession in the protestant line, and an act for a com∣mission
to treat of an union between the two kingdoms.
The Marquis of Annandale proposed that the parliament
should proceed on the limitations and conditions of go∣vernment:
that a committee should be appointed to con∣sider
the condition of the coin and the commerce of the
nation. The Earl of Mar moved, that the House would,
preferably to all other business, consider the means for
engaging in a treaty with England. After a long debate
they resolved to proceed on the coin and the commerce.
Schemes for supplying the nation with money by a paper-credit
were presented by Dr. Hugh Chamberlayne and
John Law; but rejected. The House resolved, That any
kind of paper-credit, by the circulation of bills, was an
improper expedient; and appointed a council to put the
<PB N="44" REF="48"/>
laws relating to trade in execution.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1705.</NOTE> The Duke of Ha∣milton
proposed that the parliament should not proceed to
the nomination of a successor, until the treaty with Eng∣land
should be discussed, and the limitations settled
This proposal being approved, a draft of an answer to
her Majesty's letter was presented by the Marquis of
Tweedale. Two different forms of an act for a treaty
with England were offered by the Earl of Mar and the
Marquis of Lothian: others were produced concerning
the election of officers of state, and the regulation of com∣merce.</P>
<P>§ XXX. The chief aim of the cavaliers was to obstruct
the settlement of the succession; and with that view they
pressed the project of limitations, to which they knew the
court would never assent. A motion being made, to grant
the first reading to an act of commission for a treaty with
England, the Duke of Hamilton insisted on the limitations,
and a vote being stated in these terms, “Proceed to con∣sider
the act for a treaty or limitation,” the latter was
carried in favour of the cavaliers. On the twenty-second
day of August an act for this purpose was approved; and
next day an act for a triennial parliament, which the
courtiers were enabled to defeat. They likewise passed
an act, ordaining, That the Scottish ambassadours repre∣senting
Scotland should be present when the sovereign
might have occasion to treat with foreign princes and
states, and be accountable to the parliament of Scotland.
Fletcher, of Saltoun, presented a scheme of limitations that
savoured strong of republican principles. He afterwards
enlarged upon every article, endeavouring to prove that
they were absolutely necessary to prevent the consequences
of English influence; to enable the nation to defend its
rights and liberties; to deter ministers of state from giving
bad advice to their sovereign; to preserve the courts of
judicature from corruption, and screen the people from
tyranny and oppression. The Earl of Stair having argued
against these limitations. Fletcher replied, “It was no
wonder he opposed the scheme; for, had such an act
<PB N="45" REF="49"/>
subsisted, his Lordship would have been hanged for the
bad council he had given to King James; for the con∣cern
he had in the massacre of Glencoe; and for his
conduct since the Revolution.” The next subject on
which the parliament deliberated was the conspiracy. A
motion being made that the House might know what
answer the Queen had returned to their address in the last
session, the Chancellor delivered to the Clerk-Register
the papers relating to the plot, that they might be perused
by the members; but these being copies, and the evi∣dences
remaining at London, no further progress was
made in the affair. Yet the Duke of Athol, in a distinct
narrative of the pretended conspiracy, boldly accused the
Duke of Queensberry of having endeavoured to mislead
the Queen by false insinuations against her good subjects.
When the act for a treaty of union fell under considera∣tion,
a draft for that purpose, presented by the Earl of
Mar, was compared with the English act, importing,
That the Queen should name and appoint not only the
commissioners for England, but likewise those for Scot∣land.
Fletcher did not fail to inveigh against the impe∣rious
conduct of the English parliament in this affair. He
exhorted the House to resent such treatment, and offered
the draft of an address to her Majesty on the subject;
but this the House rejected. Duke Hamilton proposed
that a clause might be added to the act, importing, That
the union should no ways derogate from any fundamental
laws, ancient privileges, offices, rights, liberties, and
dignities of the Scottish nation. This occasioned a long
debate; and, the question being put, was carried in the
negative. Another clause was proposed, that the Scottish
commissioners should not begin to treat until the English
parliament should have reseinded their clause, enacting,
That the subjects of Scotland should be adjudged and
taken as aliens after the twenty-fifth day of December.
The courtiers, considering the temper of the House, would
not venture to oppose this motion directly, but proposed
that the clause should be formed into a separate act; and
<PB N="46" REF="50"/>
the expedient was approved. Though the Duke of Athol
entered a vigorous protest, to which the greater part of
the cavaliers, and all the squadrons adhered, comprehend∣ing
four-and-twenty peers, seven-and-thirty barons, and
eighteen boroughs, the act for the treaty of union was,
after much alteration, finished, empowering commis∣sioners
to meet and treat of an union; but restraining
them from treating of any alterations of the church-go∣vernment
as by law established. While this important
subject was under consideration, the Duke of Hamilton,
to the amazement of his whole party, moved that the
nomination of the commissioners should be left to the
Queen. Fourteen or fifteen of the cavaliers ran out of
the House in a transport of indignation, exclaiming that
they were deserted and basely betrayed by the Duke of
Hamilton. A very hot debate ensued, in the course of
which the Duke was severely handled by those whom he
had hitherto conducted; but, at length, the question
being put, Whether the nomination should be left to the
Queen or to the parliament? the Duke's motion was ap∣proved
by a very small majority. He afterwards excused
himself for his defection, by saying, he saw it was in vain
to contend; and that, since the court had acquired a
great majority, he thought he might be allowed to pay
that compliment to his sovereign. He was desirous of
being in the commission, and the Duke of Argyle pro∣mised
he should be nominated. The Queen refusing to
honour him with that mark of distinction, Argyle would
not suffer himself to be named, and threatened to oppose
the union; but means were found to appease his resent∣ment.
Two drafts of an address being presented by
the Earl of Sutherland and Fletcher, of Saltoun, beseech∣ing
her Majesty to use her endeavours with the parliament
of England, to reseind that part of their act which de∣clared
the subjects, of Scotland aliens; and an overture of
a bill being offered, ordaining that the Scottish commis∣sioners
should not enter upon the treaty of union until that
clause should be repealed; the courtiers moved, that the
<PB N="47" REF="51"/>
parliament should proceed by way of order to their com∣missioners,
and by address to her Majesty. After some
debate the House assenting to this proposal, the order and
address were drawn up and approved. The great and
weighty affair of the treaty being at length happily
transacted, though not without a protest by Athol and his
adherents, the parliament granted a supply of fifty thousand
pounds, and the House was adjourned to the twentieth
day of December: then the Queen declared the Earl of
Mar secretary of state, in the room of the Marquis of
Annandale, who was appointed lord-president of the
council.</P>
<P>§XXXI. In Ireland the parliament met at Dublin on
the fifth day of March, and voted one hundred and fifty
thousand pounds for the support of the necessary branches
of the establishment. A dispute arose between the Com∣mons
and the Lower House of Convocation, relating to
the tithes of hemp and flax, ascertained in a clause of a
bill for the better improvement of the hempen and flaxen
manufactures of the kingdom. The Lower House of
Convocation presented a memorial against this clause, as
prejudicial to the rights and properties of the clergy. The
Commons voted the person who brought it guilty of a
breach of privilege; and ordered him to be taken into
custody. Then they resolved, That the Convocation
were guilty of a contempt and breach of the privilege of
that House. The Convocation presuming to justify their
memorial, the Commons voted, That all matters relating
to it should be razed out of the journals and books of Con∣vocation.
The Duke of Ormond, dreading the conse∣quence
of such heats, adjourned the parliament to the first
day of May, when the Houses meeting again, came to
some resolutions that reflected obliquely on the Convoca∣tion,
as enemies to her Majesty's government and the
protestant succession. The clergy, in order to acquit
themselves of all suspicion, resolved in their turn, That
the church and nation had been happily delivered from
popery and tyranny by King William at the Revolution:
<PB N="48" REF="52"/>
That the continuance of these blessings were due (under
God) to the auspicious reign and happy government of
her Majesty Queen Anne: That the future security and
preservation of the church and nation depended wholly
(under God) on the succession of the crown as settled by
law in the protestant line: That if any clergyman should
by word or writing declare any thing in opposition to
these resolutions, they should look upon him as a sower of
divisions among the protestants, and an enemy to the
constitution. They levelled another resolution against
the presbyterians, importing, That to teach or preach
against the doctrine, government, rites, or ceremonies of
the church, or to maintain schools or seminaries for the
education of youth, in principles contrary to those of the
established church, was a contempt of the ecclesiastical
laws of the kingdom; of pernicious consequence; and
served only to continue and widen the unhappy schisms
and divisions in the nation. In June the parliament was
prorogued to the same month of the following year: then
the Duke of Ormond embarked for England, leaving the
administration in the hands of Sir Richard Cox, lord∣chancellor,
and the Lord Cutts, commander in chief of
the Queen's forces, who were appointed lords-justices
during the Duke's absence.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. During these transactions in Great-Britain
and Ireland, the allies had not been remiss in their prepa∣rations
for the ensuing campaign. The Duke of Marlbo∣rough
had fixed upon the Moselle for the scene of action;
and magazines of all sorts were formed at Triers. On
the thirteenth day of March the Duke embarked for Hol∣land,
where he prevailed upon the States-General to con∣tribute
their troops for the execution of his project. Having
concerted with the deputies of the States and the Dutch
generals the necessary measures for opening the campaign,
he set out for Maestricht, in order to assemble his army.
On the fifth day of May the Emperor Leopold died at
Vienna, and was succeeded on the Imperial throne by his
eldest son Joseph King of the Romans, a prince who
<PB N="49" REF="53"/>
resembled his father in meekness of disposition, narrowness
of intellect, and bigotry to the Romish religion. On the
fifteenth of June the English troops passed the Maese, and
continued their march towards the Moselle, under the
command of General Churchill; and the Duke set out
for Creutznach, to conser with Prince Louis of Baden,
who excused himself on pretence of being much indisposed.
Marlborough visited him at Rastadt, where in a confe∣rence
they resolved that a sufficient number of German
troops should be left for the security of the lines of Lauter∣burg
and Stolhoffen, under the command of General
Thungen; and that Prince Louis of Baden should march
with a large detachment towards the Saar, to act in con∣cert
with the Duke of Marlborough. The confederate
army passed the Moselle and the Saar in the beginning of
June, and encamped at Elft in sight of the enemy, who
retired with great precipitation, and entrenched themselves
in the neighbourhood of Coningsmacheren. The Duke's
design was to besiege Saar-Louis; but Prince Louis failed
in the performance of his engagement: he feigned himself
sick, and repaired to the bath at Schlangenbade, leaving
the small number of Imperial troops he had conducted as
far as Creutznach, under the command of the Count de
Frize. He was suspected of treachery; but probably acted
from envy of the Duke's military reputation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Duke of Marlborough, finding himself obliged to retreat, sent a note with a trumpeter to Villars, containing an apology for decamping.— “Do me the justice (said he) to believe that my retreat is entirely owing to the failure of the Prince of Baden; but that my esteem for you is still greater than my resentment of his conduct.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. While this nobleman sustained such a mor∣tifying
disappointment on the Moselle, the French did
not fail to make advantage of their superiority in the Ne∣therlands,
where General D'Auverquerque was obliged to
stand on the defensive. They invested Huy, and carried
on their operations so vigorously, that in a few days the
garrison were obliged to surrender themselves prisoners of
war: then Villeroy undertook the reduction of Liege, and
actually began his works before the citadel. Marlborough
<PB N="50" REF="54"/>
was no sooner informed of the enemy's progress than he
marched to Triers, where, in a council, it was resolved
that the army should return to the Netherlands. The
troops were in motion on the nineteenth of June, and
marched with such expedition, that they passed the Maese
on the first day of July. Villeroy having received advice
of the Duke's approach, abandoned his enterprise, and
retired to Tongeren, from whence he retreated within his
lines, that reached from Marche aux Dames on the Meuse,
along the Mehaigne, as far as Lenuive. Marlborough
having joined D'Auverquerque, sent General Scholten with
a detachment to invest Huy; and in a few days the gar∣rison
surrendered at discretion. The English general re∣solving
to strike some stroke of importance that should
atone for his disappointment on the Moselle, sent General
Hompesch to the States, with a proposal for attacking
the French lines; and obtained their permission to do
whatever he should think proper for the good of the com∣mon
cause. Then he explained the scheme in two suc∣cessive
councils of war, by which, at length, it was ap∣proved
and resolved upon, though some Dutch generals
declared themselves against the undertaking. The enemy
were posted along the lines, amounting to one hundred
battalions and one hundred and forty-six squadrons. The
allied army did not much exceed that number. In order
to divide them, D'Auverquerque made a false motion and
passed the Mehaigne, as if he had intended to attack the
lines about Messelin. The stratagem succeeded. The
French weakened the other parts by strengthening that
which was on the side of the Gerbise towards Namur.
The Duke of Marlborough having made the disposition,
the army began to march in the night between the seven∣teenth
and eighteenth of July, in order to force a passage
of the French lines at Heylesem, the castle of Wauge,
and the villages of Wauge, Neerhespen, and Oostmalen.
These posts were taken with very little difficulty: but,
before the insantry could come up, the enemy advanced
with fifty squadrons and twenty battalions, and began to
<PB N="51" REF="55"/>
fire from eight pieces of cannon with triple barrels, which
did considerable execution. The Duke perceiving that
they were continually re-enforced from the other parts of
the lines, ordered the horse to charge their cavalry, which
were soon broken and routed: but rallying behind their
infantry, interlined with foot, and joined by fresh squa∣drons,
they advanced again towards the allies, who were
now sustained by their infantry, and moved forwards to
renew the charge. After a warm, though short engage∣ment,
the enemy's horse were defeated with great slaughter.
The infantry, seeing themselves abandoned in the plain,
retreated in great disorder, between the villages of Heylesem
and Golsteven, where they were joined by the rest of
their army, and formed again in order of battle. Mean
while the Duke of Marlborough ordered all his troops to
enter the lines; and extended his right towards the Great
Geete before Tirlemont, where the enemy had left the
battalion of Montluc, which surrendered at discretion.
In this action the confederates took the Marquis D'Alegre
and the Count de Horne, lieutenant-generals, one major-general,
two brigadier-generals, with many other officers,
and a great number of common soldiers; a large heap of
standards, four colours, one pair of kettle-drums, and
ten pieces of cannon. In the action, as the Duke of
Marlborough advanced to the charge at the head of several
squadrons, a Bavarian officer rode up to attack him sword
in hand; but in raising himself on his stirrups to strike
with the greater advantage, he fell from his horse, and was
immediately slain.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. The body of troops commanded by Mon∣sieur
D'Alegre being thus defeated with little or no loss to
the confederates, the Elector of Bavaria and the Mareschal
de Villeroy passed the Great Geete and the Deule, with
great expedition, and took possession of the strong camp
at Parck, their left extending to Rooselaer, and their right
to Wineselen against the height of Louvain. Next day
the Duke of Marlborough marching through the plain of
Parck, took twelve hundred prisoners, who could not
<PB N="52" REF="56"/>
keep pace with the rest of the enemy's forces; and in the
evening he encamped with the right at the abbey of
Vliersbeck, and the left before Bierbeck, under the cannon
of Louvain. He detached Lieutenant-General Henkelum,
the Duke of Wirtemberg, and Count Oxienstiern, with
a considerable body of forces, to attack some posts on the
Deule, which were slenderly guarded. Their advanced
guard accordingly passed the river, and repulsed the enemy:
but, for want of timely support, they were obliged to pass
it and retire. On the third of August Baron Spaar, with
a body of Dutch troops, marched to Raboth on the canal
of Bruges, forced the French lines at Lovendegen, and
took four forts by which they were defended; but receiv∣ing
advice that the enemy were on their march towards
him, he retired to Mildegem, and carried with him several
hostages, as security for the payment of the contributions
he had raised. On the fifteenth the Duke moved from
Mildert to Corbais; next day continued his march to
Genap, from whence he advanced to Fischermont. On
the seventeenth General D'Auverquerque took the post of
Waterlo; and next day the confederate army was drawn
up in order of battle before the enemy, who extended from
Overysche, near the wood of Soignies, to Neerysche, with
the little river Ysche in their front, so as to cover Brussels
and Louvain. The Duke of Marlborough proposed to
attack them immediately before they should recollect them∣selves
from their consternation; and D'Auverquerque ap∣proved
of the design: but it was opposed by General
Schlangenburg, and other Dutch officers, who repre∣sented
it in such a light to the deputies of the States, that
they refused to concur in the execution. The Duke
being obliged to relinquish the scheme, wrote an expostu∣latory
letter to the States-General, complaining of their
having withdrawn that considence which they had reposed
in him while he acted in Germany. This letter being
published at the Hague, excited murmurs among the
people; and the English nation were incensed at the pre∣sumption
of the Deputies, who wrote several letters in
<PB N="53" REF="57"/>
their own justification to the States-General: but these
had no effect upon the populace, by whom the Duke was
respected even to a degree of adoration. The States being
apprised of the resentment that prevailed over all England,
and that the Earl of Pembroke, lord-president of the
council, was appointed as envoy extraordinary to Holland,
with instructions to demand satisfaction, thought proper
to anticipate his journey, by making submissions to the
Duke, and removing Schlangenburg from his command.
The confederate army returned to Corbais, from whence
it marched to Perwitz, where it encamped. The little
town of Sout-Leeuwe, situated in the middle of a morass,
and constituting the chief defence of the enemy's lines,
being taken by a detachment under the command of Lieute∣nant-General
Dedem, the Duke ordered the lines from
this place to Wasseigne to be levelled, and the town of
Tirlemont to be dismantled: then passing the Demer, he
encamped on the nineteenth of September at Aerschot.
About the latter end of the month he marched to He∣venthals:
from hence the Duke repaired to the Hague,
where he had several conferences with the Pensionary. In
a few days he returned to the army, which decamping
from Heventhals, marched to Clampthout. On the
twenty-fourth day of October the Count de Noyelles in∣vested
Santvliet, which surrendered before the end of the
month.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. At this period the Duke, in consequence of
pressing letters from the Emperor, set out for Vienna, in
order to concert the operations of the ensuing campaign,
and other measures of importance, in which the concerns
of the allies were interested. In his way he was magni∣ficently
entertained by the Elector Palatine, and him of
Triers, and complimented by the magistracy of Francfort,
where he conferred with Prince Louis of Baden. On the
twelfth of November he arrived at Vienna, where he was
treated with the highest marks of distinction and cordial
friendship by their Imperial majesties. His son-in-law, the
Earl of Sunderland, had been sent thither as envoy extra∣ordinary;
<PB N="54" REF="58"/>
and now they conferred together with the Em∣peror
and his ministers. They resolved to maintain the
war with redoubled vigour. The treaties were renewed,
and provision made for the security of the Duke of Savoy.
The Emperor, in consideration of the Duke's signal ser∣vice
to the house of Austria, presented him with a grant
of the lordship of Mindelheim in Suabia, which was now
erected into a principality of the Roman empire. In his
return with the Earl of Sunderland he visited the courts
of Berlin and Hanover, where he was received with that
extraordinary respect which was due to his character; and
arrived at the Hague on the fourteenth day of December.
There he settled the operations of the next campaign with
the States-General, who consented to join England in
maintaining an additional body of ten thousand men, as
a re-enforcement to the army of Prince Eugene in Italy.
While the allies were engaged in the siege of Santvliet,
the Elector of Bavaria sent a detachment, under the com∣mand
of Don Marcello de Grimaldi, to invest Diest, the
garrison of which were made prisoners of war.</P>
<P>§ XXXVI. On the Upper Rhine Mareschal Villars
besieged and took Homburg, and passed the Rhine at
Strasburg on the sixth day of August. Prince Louis of
Baden arriving in the camp of the Imperialists at Stol∣hoffen,
not only obliged him to retire, but having passed
the river, forced the French lines at Hagenau: then he
reduced Drusenheim and Hagenau, but attempted no en∣terprise
equal to the number of his army, although the
Emperor had expostulated with him severely on his con∣duct;
and he had now a fair opportunity of emulating
the glory of Marlborough, upon whom he looked with
the eyes of an envious rival. In Italy a battle was fought
at Casano, between Prince Eugene and the Duke de
Vendome, with dubious success. The Duke de Feuil∣lade
reduced Chivas, and invested Nice, which, after an
obstinate defence, surrendered in December. All the con∣siderable
places belonging to the Duke of Savoy were now
taken, except Coni and Turin; and his little army was
<PB N="55" REF="59"/>
reduced to twelve thousand men, whom he could hardly
support. His duchess, his clergy, and his subjects in
general, pressed him to submit to the necessity of his
affairs; but he adhered to the alliance with surprising
fortitude. He withstood the importunities of his duchess,
excluded all the bishops and clergy from his councils;
and, when he had occasion for a confessor, chose a priest
occasionally, either from the Dominicans or Franciscans.
The campaign in Portugal began with a very promising
aspect. The allies invaded Spain by the different frontiers
of Beyra and Alentejo. Their army, under the command
of the Conde das Galveas, undertook the siege of Valencia
D'Alcantara in May, and took it by assault: Albu∣querque
surrendered upon articles; and then the troops
were sent into quarters of refreshment. The Marquis de
las Minas, who commanded the Portuguese in the pro∣vince
of Beyra, reduced the town of Salva-terra, plun∣dered
and burned Sarca; but was obliged to retire to Pe∣namacos
at the approach of the enemy. Towards the end
of September the confederates being re-assembled, invested
Badajox, by the advice of the Earl of Galway, who lost
his right-hand by a cannon-ball, and was obliged to be
carried off; so that the conduct of the siege was left to
General Fagel. He had made considerable progress to∣wards
the reduction of the place, when the Marquis de
Thess<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> found means to throw in a powerfull re-enforce∣ment;
and then the confederates abandoned the enter∣prise.
The war continued to rage in Hungary with va∣rious
success. Ragotski, though frequently worsted,
appeared still in arms, and ravaged the country, which
became a scene of misery and desolation. In Poland the
old Cardinal Primate owned Stanislaus, but died before the
coronation, which was performed by the Bishop of Cuja∣via.
In the beginning of winter King Augustus had
passed through Poland in disguise to the Muscovite army,
which was put under his command in Lithuania; and the
campaign was protracted through the whole winter-season,
notwithstanding the severity of the weather in that
<PB N="56" REF="60"/>
northern climate. In the spring the Swedish general,
Reinchild, obtained a complete victory over the Saxon ar∣my,
which was either cut in pieces or taken, with their
camp, baggage, and artillery; yet the war was not ex∣tinguished.
The King of Sweden continued obstinately
deaf to all proposals of peace, and was become as savage
in his manners, as brutal in his revenge.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. At sea the arms of the allies were gene∣rally
prosperous. Philip of Spain being obstinately bent
upon retaking Gibraltar, sent Mareschal de Thess<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to
renew the siege, while De Pointis was ordered to block up
the place by sea with his squadron. These French officers
carried on the sege with such activity, that the Prince of
Hesse dispatched an express to Lisbon with a letter, desiring
Sir John Leake to sail immediately to his assistance. This
admiral having been re-enforced from England by Sir
Thomas Dilkes, with five ships of the line and a body of
troops, set sail immediately; and on the tenth day of
March descried five ships of war hauling out of the bay of
Gibraltar. These were commanded by De Pointis in
person, to whom the English admiral gave chase. One
of them struck, after having made a very flight resistance;
and the rest ran ashore to the westward of Marbella, where
they were destroyed. The remaining part of the French
squadron had been blown from their anchors, and taken
shelter in the bay of Malaga; but now they slipped their
cables, and made the best of their way to Toulon. The
Mareschal de Thesse, in consequence of this disaster,
turned the siege of Gibraltar into a blockade, and with∣drew
the greater part of his forces. While Sir John Leake
was employed in this expedition, Sir George Byng, who
had been ordered to cruise in soundings for the protection
of trade, took a ship of forty guns from the enemy, to∣gether
with twelve privateers, and seven vessels richly laden
from the West-Indies.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. But the most eminent atchievement of
this summer, was the reduction of Barcelona, by the cele∣brated
Earl of Peterborough and Sir Cloudesley Shovel,
<PB N="57" REF="61"/>
who sailed from St. Helen's in the latter end of May with
the English fleet, having on board a body of five thousand
land-forces; and on the twentieth of June arrived at
Lisbon, where they were joined by Sir John Leake and the
Dutch admiral, Allemonde. In a council of war, they
determined to put to sea with eight-and-forty ships of the
line, which should be stationed between Cape Spartel and
the bay of Cadiz, in order to prevent the junction of the
Toulon and Brest squadrons. The Prince of Hesse-Darmstadt
arriving from Gibraltar, assured King Charles,
that the province of Catalonia and the kingdom of Valen∣cia
were attached to his interest; and his Majesty being
weary of Portugal, resolved to accompany the Earl of
Peterborough to Barcelona. He accordingly embarked
with him on board of the Ranelagh; and the fleet sailed
on the twenty-eighth day of July, the Earl of Galway
having re-enforced them with two regiments of English
dragoons. At Gibraltar they took on board the English
guards, and three old regiments, in lieu of which they
left two new-raised battalions. On the eleventh day of
August they anchored in the bay of Altea, where the Earl
of Peterborough published a manifesto in the Spanish
language, which had such an effect, that all the inhabi∣tants
of the place, the neighbouring villages, and adjacent
mountains, acknowledged King Charles as their lawful
sovereign. They seised the town of Denia for his service;
and he sent thither a garrison of four hundred men under
the command of Major General Ramos. On the twenty-second
they arrived in the bay of Barcelona: the troops
were disembarked to the castward of the city, where they
encamped in a strong situation, and were well received by
the country people. King Charles landed amidst the ac∣clamations
of an in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inite multitude from the neighbour∣ing
towns and villages, who threw themselves at his feet,
exclaiming, “Long live the King!” and exhibited all
the marks of the most extravagant joy. The inhabitants
of Barcelona were well affected to the house of Austria,
but overawed by a garrison of five thousand men under
<PB N="58" REF="62"/>
the Duke de Popoli, Valasco, and other officers devoted
to the interest of King Philip. Considering the strength
of such a garrison, and the small number of Dutch and
English troops, nothing could appear more desperate and
dangerous than the design of besieging the place; yet this
was proposed by the Prince of Hesse-Darmstadt, who
served in the expedition as a volunteer, strongly urged by
King Charles, and approved by the Earl of Peterborough
and Sir Cloudesley Shovel. The city was accordingly in∣vested
on one side; but, as a previous step to the reduc∣tion
of it, they resolved to attack the fort of Montjuic,
strongly situated on a hill that commanded the city. The
outworks were taken by storm, with the loss of the gal∣lant
Prince of Hesse, who was shot through the body, and
expired in a few hours: then the Earl of Peterborough
began to bombard the body of the fort; and a shell
chancing to fall into the magazine of powder, blew it up,
together with the governor and some of the best officers;
an accident which struck such a terror into the garrison,
that they surrendered without further resistance.</P>
<P>§ XXXIX. This great point being gained, the English
general erected his batteries against the town, with the
help of the Miquelets and seamen: the bomb-ketches
began to fire with such execution, that in a few days the
governor capitulated, and on the fourth day of October
King Charles entered in triumph<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voltaire, upon what authority we know not, tells us, that during the capitulation, the German and Catalonian troops found means to climb over the ramparts into the city, and began to commit the most barbarous excesses: the Vicer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y complained to Peterborough that his soldiers had taken an unfair advantage of the treaty, and were actually employed in burning, plundering, murthering, and violating the inhabitants. The Earl replied, “They must then be the troops of the Prince of Hesse: allow me to enter the city with my English forces: I will save it from ruin; oblige the Germans to retire, and march back again to our present situation.” The Viceroy trusted his honour, and forthwith admitted the Earl with his troops. He soon drove out the Germans and Catalonians, after having obliged them to quit the plunder they had taken; and by accident he rescued the Du∣chess of Popoli from the hands of two brutal soldiers, and delivered her to her husband. Having thus appeased the tumult and dispelled the horrours of the citizens, he returned to his former station, leaving the inhabitants of Barcelona amazed at such an instance of magnanimity and moderation in a people whom they had been taught to consider as the most savage barbarians.</NOTE> All the other places
in Catalonia declared for him, except Roses; so that the
<PB N="59" REF="63"/>
largest and richest province of Spain was conquered with
an army scarce double the number of the garrison of Bar∣celona.
King Charles wrote a letter with his own hand
to the Queen of England, containing a circumstantial
detail of his affairs, the warmest expressions of acknow∣ledgment,
and the highest encomiums on her subjects,
particularly the Earl of Peterborough. In a council of
war it was determined that the King and the Earl should
continue in Catalonia with the land-forces: that Sir
Cloudesley Shovel should return to England; that five-and-twenty
English and fifteen Dutch ships of war should
winter at Lisbon, under the command of Sir John Leake
and the Dutch rear-admiral, Wassenaer; and that four
English and two Dutch frigates should remain at Barce∣lona.
Don Francisco de Velasco was transported to Ma∣laga
with about a thousand men of his garrison; the rest
voluntarily engaged in the service of King Charles, and six
other regiments were raised by the states of Catalonia.
The Count de Cifuentes, at the head of the Miquelets
and Catalans attached to the House of Austria, secured
Tarragona, Tortosa, Lerida, San-Mattheo, Gironne,
and other places. Don Raphael Nevat, revolting from
Philip with his whole regiment of horse, joined General
Ramos at Denia, and made themselves masters of several
places of importance in the kingdom of Valencia. Flushed
with such unexpected success they penetrated to the capital
of the same name, which they surprised, together with
the Marquis de Villa-Garcia, the viceroy, and the arch∣bishop.
These advantages, however, were not properly
improved. The court of Charles was divided into
factions, and so much time lost in disputes, that the
enemy sent a body of six thousand men into the kingdom
of Valencia, under the command of the Conde de las
Torres, who forthwith invested San-Mattheo, guarded
<PB N="60" REF="64"/>
by Colonel Jones at the head of five hundred Miquelets.
This being a place of great consequence, on account of
its situation, the Earl of Peterborough marched thither
with one thousand infantry, and two hundred dragoons;
and by means of feigned intelligence artfully conveyed to
the Conde, induced that general to abandon the siege with
precipitation, in the apprehension of being suddenly at∣tacked
by a considerable army. Peterborough afterwards
took possession of Nules, and purchasing horses at Castillon
de la Plana, began to form a body of cavalry, which did
good service in the sequel. Having assembled a little army,
consisting of ten squadrons of horse and dragoons, and
four battalions of regular troops, with about three thou∣sand
militia, he marched to Molviedro, which was
surrendered to him by the governor, Brigadier Mahoni.
Between this officer and the Duke d'Arcos, the Spanish
general, he excited such jealousies by dint of artifices not
altogether justifiable even in war, that the Duke was
more intent upon avoiding the supposed treachery of Ma∣honi
than upon interrupting the Earl's march to Valencia,
where the inhabitants expressed uncommon marks of joy
at his arrival. About this period a very obstinate action
happened at St. Istevan de Litera, where the Chevalier
D'Asfeldt, with nine squadrons of horse and dragoons, and
as many battalions of French infantry, attacked Colonel
Wills at the head of a small detachment; but this last
being supported by Lieutenant-General Cuningham, who
was mortally wounded in the engagement, repulsed the
enemy, though three times his number, with the loss of
four hundred men killed upon the spot. The troops on
both sides fought with the most desperate valour, keeping
up their fire until the muzzles of their pieces met, and
charging each other at the point of bayonet. The only
misfortunate that attended the English arms in the course
of this year was the capture of the Baltic fleet homeward-bound,
with their convoy of three ships of war, which
were taken by the Dunkirk squadron under the command
of the Count de St. Paul, though he himself was killed
<PB N="61" REF="65"/>
in the engagement. When an account of this advantage
was communicated to the French King, he replied with a
sigh, “Very well, I wish the ships were safe again in any
English port, provided the Count de St. Paul could be
restored to life.” After the death of the famous Du
Bart, this officer was counted the best seaman in France.</P>
<P>§ XL. The kingdom of England was now wholly
engrossed by the election of members for the new parlia∣ment.
The Tories exerted themselves with great industry,
and propagated the cry of the church's being in danger;
a cry in which the Jacobites joined with great fervour:
but, notwithstanding all their efforts, in word and writ∣ing,
a majority of Whigs was returned; and now the
Lord Godolphin, who had hitherto maintained a neutra∣lity,
thought proper openly to countenance that faction.
By his interest co-operating with the influence of the
Duchess of Marlborough, Sir Nathan Wright was de∣prived
of the great seal, which was committed to Mr.
William Cowper, with the title of lord-keeper. This was
a lawyer of good extraction, superior talents, engaging
manners, and eminence in his profession. He was staunch
to whig principles, and for many years had been consi∣dered
as one of their best speakers in the House of Com∣mons.
The new parliament meeting on the twenty-fifth
day of October, a violent contest arose about the choice
of a speaker. Mr. Bromley was supported by the Tories,
and the Whigs proposed Mr. John Smith, who was
elected by a majority of forty-three voices. The Queen
in her speech represented the necessity of acting vigorously
against France, as a common enemy to the liberties of
Europe: she commended the fortitude of the Duke of
Savoy, which she said was without example; she told
them her intention was to expedite commissions for treat∣ing
of an union with Scotland: she earnestly recommended
an union of minds and affections among her people: she
observed, that some persons had endeavoured to foment
animosities, and even suggested in print, that the esta∣blished
church was in danger: she affirmed that such
<PB N="62" REF="66"/>
people were enemies to her and to the kingdom, and
meant only to cover designs which they durst not pub∣lickly
own, by endeavouring to distract the nation with
unreasonable and groundless distrusts and jealousies: she
declared she would always affectionately support and coun∣tenance
the church of England, as by law established;
that she would inviolably maintain the toleration; that
she would promote religion and virtue, encourage trade,
and every thing else that might make them a happy and
flourishing people.</P>
<P>§ XLI. The majority in both Houses now professed the
same principles, and were well disposed to support the
Queen in all her designs. They first presented the usual
addresses, in the warmest terms of duty and affection.
Then the Commons drew up a second, assuring her they
would, to the utmost of their power, assist her in bringing
the treaty of union to a happy conclusion. They desired
that the proceedings of the last session of parliament, relat∣ing
to the union and succession, might be laid before the
House. The Lords had solicited the same satisfaction;
and her Majesty promised to comply with their request.
The Lower House having heard and decided in some cases
of controverted elections, proceeded to take into conside∣ration
the estimates for the service of the ensuing year, and
granted the supplies without hesitation. In the House of
Lords, while the Queen was present, Lord Haversham,
at the end of a long speech, in which he reflected upon
the conduct of the Duke of Marlborough, both on the
Moselle and in Brabant, moved for an address to desire
her Majesty would invite the presumptive heir to the
crown of England to come and reside in the kingdom.
This motion was earnestly supported by the Duke of
Buckingham, the Earls of Rochester, Nottingham, and
Anglesey. They said there was no method so effectual to
secure the succession, as that of the successors being upon
the spot, ready to assume and maintain his or her right
against any pretender; and they observed, that in former
times, when the throne of England was vacant, the first
<PB N="63" REF="67"/>
comer had always succeeded in his pretensions. The pro∣posal
was vehemently opposed by the Whigs, who knew
it was disagreeable to the Queen, whom they would not
venture to disoblige. They argued, that a rivalry be∣tween
the two courts might produce distractions, and be
attended with very ill consequences; and observed, that
the Princess Sophia had expressed a full satisfaction in the
assurances of the Queen, who had promised to maintain
her title. The question being put, was carried in the
negative by a great majority. The design of the Tories
in making this motion was to bring the other party into dis∣grace,
either with the Queen or with the people. Their
joining in the measure would have given umbrage to their
sovereign; and, by opposing it, they ran the risque of
incurring the publick odium, as enemies to the protestant
succession; but the pretence of the Tories was so thin, the
nation saw through it; and the sole effect the motion pro∣duced,
was the Queen's resentment against the whole
party. Burnet, Bishop of Sarum, proposed that pro∣vision
might be made for maintaining the publick quiet,
in the interval between the Queen's decease, and the ar∣rival
of her successor; the motion was seconded by the
Lord-Treasurer; and a bill brought in for the better se∣curity
of her Majesty's person and government, and of the
succession to the crown of England. By this act, a re∣gency
was appointed of the seven persons that should pos∣sess
the offices of Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Chan∣cellor
or Lord-Keeper, Lord-Treasurer, Lord-President,
Lord Privy-Seal, Lord High-Admiral, and the Lord-Chief-Justice
of the Queen's-Bench. Their business was
to proclaim the next successor through the kingdom of
England, and join with a certain number of persons named
as regents by the successor, in three lists, to be sealed up
and deposited with the Archbishop of Canterbury, the
Lord-Keeper, and the Minister Residentiary of Hanover,
It was enacted, That these joint regencies should conduct
the administration; that the last Parliament, even though
dissolved, should re-assemble, and continue sitting for six
<PB N="64" REF="68"/>
months after the decease of her Majesty. The bill met
with a warm opposition from the Tories, and did not
pass the Upper House without a protest. It was still fur∣ther
obstructed in the House of Commons even by some of
the Whig party, who were given to understand that the
Princess Sophia had expressed an inclination to reside in
England. Exceptions were likewise taken to that clause
in the bill, enacting that the last parliament should be
re-assembled. They affirmed, that this was inconsistent
with part of the act by which the succession was at first
settled; for, among other limitations, the parliament had
provided, that when the crown should devolve to the
house of Hanover, no man, who had either place or
pension, should be capable of sitting in the House of
Commons. After tedious disputes and zealous alterca∣tion,
they agreed that a certain number of offices should
be specified as disqualifying places. This self-denying
clause, and some other amendments, produced confe∣rences
between the two Houses, and at length the bill
passed by their mutual assent. Lord Haversham moved
for an enquiry into the miscarriages of the last campaign,
hoping to find some foundation for censure in the conduct
of the Duke of Marlborough; but the proposal was re∣jected
as invidious; and the two Houses presented an ad∣dress
to the Queen, desiring she would preserve a good
correspondence among all the confederates. They like∣wise
concurred in repealing the act by which the Scots had
been alienated, and all the northern counties alarmed
with the apprehension of a rupture between the two na∣tions.
The Lord Shannon and Brigadier Stanhope arriv∣ing
with an account of the expedition to Catalonia, the
Queen communicated the good news in a speech to both
Houses, expressing her hope that they would enable her
to prosecute the advantages which her arms had acquired.
The Commons were so well pleased with the tidings, that
they forthwith granted two hundred and fifty thousand
pounds for her Majesty's proportion in the expense of pro∣secuting
the successes already gained by King Charles III.
<PB N="65" REF="69"/>
for the recovery of the monarchy of Spain to the house of
Austria. On the fifteenth day of November, the Queen
gave the royal assent to an act for exhibiting a bill to natu∣ralize
the Princess Sophia, and the issue of her body.</P>
<P>§ XLII. These measures being taken, the sixth day of
December was appointed for enquiring into those dangers
to which the Tories affirmed the church was exposed; and
the Queen attended in person, to hear the debates on this
interesting subject. The Earl of Rochester compared the
expressions in the Queen's speech at the beginning of the
session to the law enacted in the reign of Charles II. de∣nouncing
the penalties of treason against those who should
call the King a papist; for which reason, he said, he
always thought him of that persuasion. He affirmed that
the church's danger arose from the act of security in
Scotland, the absence of the successor to the crown, and
the practice of occasional conformity. He was answered
by Lord Hallifax, who, by way of recrimination, ob∣served
that King Charles II. was a Roman catholick, at
least his brother declared him a papist after his death;
that his brother and successor was a known Roman catho∣lick,
yet the church thought herself secure; and those
patriots who stood up in its defence were discountenanced
and punished: nay, when that successor ascended the
throne, and the church was apparently in the most immi∣nent
danger, by the high commission court and otherwise,
the nation was then indeed generally alarmed; and every
body knew who sat in that court, and entered deeply
into the measures which were then pursued. Compton,
Bishop of London, declared that the church was in danger,
from profaneness, irrelion, and the licentiousness of the
press. He complained, that sermons were preached
wherein rebellion was countenanced, and resistance to the
higher powers encouraged. He alluded to a sermon
preached before the Lord Mayor, by Mr. Hoadley, now
Bishop of Winchester. Burnet of Sarum said the Bishop
of London was the last man who ought to complain of
that sermon; for if the doctrine it contained was not good,
<PB N="66" REF="70"/>
he did not know what defence his lordship could make for
his appearing in arms at Nottingham. He affirmed the
church would be always subject to profaneness and irreli∣gion,
but that they were not now so flagrant as they
usually had been; he said the society set up for reforma∣tion
in London, and other cities, had contributed consi∣derably
to the suppression of vice; he was sure the corpora∣tion
for propagating the gospel had done a great deal to∣wards
instructing men in religion, by giving great numbers
of books in practical divinity; by erecting libraries in
country parishes; by sending many able divines to the
foreign plantations, and founding schools to breed up
children in the christian knowledge; though to this ex∣pense
very little had been contributed by those who ap∣peared
so wonderfully zealous for the church. The Arch∣bishop
of York expressed his apprehension of danger from
the increase of dissenters; particularly from the many aca∣demies
they had instituted; he moved that the judges
might be consulted with respect to the laws that were in
force against such seminaries, and by what means they
might be suppressed. Lord Wharton moved that the
judges might also be consulted about means of suppressing
schools and seminaries held by nonjurors; in one of which
the sons of a noble lord in that House had been educated.
To this sarcasm the Archbishop replied, that his sons were
indeed taught by Mr. Ellis, a sober, virtuous man; but
that when he refused the oath of abjuration, they were
immediately withdrawn from his instructions. Lord
Wharton proceeded to declare, that he had carefully
perused a pamphlet entitled “The Memorial,” which
was said to contain a demonstration that the church was
in danger; but all he could learn was, that the Duke of
Buckingham, the Earls of Rochester and Nottingham,
were out of place; that he remembered some of these no∣blemen
sat in the high-commission court, and then made
no complaint of the church's being in danger. Patri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Bishop of Ely complained of the heat and passion mani∣fested
by the gentlemen belonging to the universities; and
<PB N="67" REF="71"/>
of the undutiful behaviour of the clergy towards their
bishops. He was seconded by Hough of Lichfield and
Coventry, who added, that the inferior clergy calumniated
their bishops, as if they were in a plot to destroy the
church, and had compounded to be the last of their order.
Hooper of Bath and Wells expatiated on the invidious
distinction implied in the terms “High church,” and
“Low church.” The Duke of Leeds asserted, that the
church could not be safe, without an act against occasional
conformity. Lord Somers recapitulated all the arguments
which had been used on both sides of the question; he de∣clared
his own opinion was, that the nation was happy
under a wise and just administration; that for men to raise
groundless jealousies at that juncture, could mean no less
than an intention to embroil the people at home, and de∣feat
the glorious designs of the allies abroad. The debate
being finished, the question was put, Whether the church
of England was in danger? and carried in the negative by
a great majority: then the House resolved, That the church
of England as by law established, which was rescued from
the extremest danger by King William III. of glorious
memory, is now, by God's blessing, under the happy
reign of her Majesty, in a most safe and flourishing condi∣tion;
and that whoever goes about to suggest or insinuate
that the church is in danger, under her Majesty's admini∣stration,
is an enemy to the Queen, the church, and the
kingdom. Next day the Commons concurred in this de∣termination,
and joined the Lords in an address to the
Queen, communicating this resolution, beseeching her to
take effectual measures for making it publick; and also
for punishing the authors and spreaders of the seditious and
scandalous reports of the church's being in danger. She
accordingly issued a proclamation, containing the resolu∣tion
of the two Houses, and offering a reward for disco∣vering
the author of the memorial of the church of Eng∣land,
and for apprehending David Edwards, a prosessed
papist, charged upon oath to be the printer and publisher of
that libel.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="72"/>
§ XLIII. After a short adjournment, a committee of
the Lower House presented the thanks of the Commons
to the Duke of Marlborough, for his great services per∣formed
to her Majesty and the nation in the last campaign,
and for his prudent negociations with her allies. This
nobleman was such credit with the people, that when
he proposed a loan of five hundred thousand pounds to the
Emperor, upon a branch of his revenue in Silesia, the
money was advanced immediately by the merchants of
London. The kingdom was blessed with plenty; the
Queen was universally beloved; the people in general
were zealous for the prosecution of the war; the forces
were well paid; the treasury was punctual; and, though
a great quantity of coin was exported for the maintenance
of the war, the paper-currency supplied the deficiency so
well, that no murmurs were heard, and the publick credit
flourished both at home and abroad. All the funds being
established, one in particular for two millions and a half
by way of annuities for ninety-nine years, at six and a
half per cent; and all the bills having received the royal
assent, the Queen went to the House of Peers on the
nineteenth day of March, where having thanked both
Houses for the repeated instances of their affection which
she had received, she prorogued the parliament to the
twenty-first day of May following<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among other bills passed during this session was an act for abridging and reforming some proceedings in the common law and in Chancery.</NOTE>. The new convoca∣tion,
instead of imitating the union and harmony of the
parliament, revived the divisions by which the former had
been distracted, and the two Houses seemed to act with
more determined rancour against each other. The Upper
House having drawn up a warm address of thanks to the
Queen, for her affectionate care of the church, the Lower
House refused to concur; nor would they give any reason
for their dissent. They prepared another in a different
strain,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>net.</NOTE> which was rejected by the Archbishop.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er.</NOTE> Then they

him to impart this declaration to the bishops and
clergy, and to prorogue the Convocation to such time as
should appear most convenient. When he communicated
this letter to the Lower House, the members were not a
little confounded; nevertheless, they would not comply
with the prorogation, but continued to sit in defiance of
her Majesty's pleasure.</P>
<P>§ XLIV. The eyes of Great-Britain were now turned
upon a transaction of the utmost consequence to the whole
island;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1706.</NOTE> namely, the treaty for an union of the two king∣doms
of England and Scotland. The Queen having ap∣pointed
the commissioners<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The English commissioners were, Thomas Lord Archbishop of Canter∣bury; William Cowper, lord-keeper of the great-seal; John Lord Arch∣bishop of York; Sidney Lord Godolphin, lord high-treasurer of England; Thomas Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery, president of the council; John Duke of Newcastle, keeper of the privy-seal; William Duke of Le∣vonshire, steward of the household; Charles Duke of Somerset. master of the horse; Charles Duke of Bolton, Charles Earl of Sunderland, Evel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Earl of Kingston, Charles Earl of Carlisle, Edward Earl of Orford, Charles Viscount Townshend, Thomas Lord Wharton, Ralph Lord Grey, John Lord Powlet, John Lord Somers, Charles Lord Hallifax, William Cavendish Marquis of Hartington, John Manners Marquis of Granby; Sir Charles Hedges and Robert Harley, principal secretaries of state; John Smith; Henry Boyle, chancellor of the Exchequer; Sir John Holt, chief justice of the Queen's Bench; Sir Thomas Trevor, chief justice of the Common-Pleas; Sir Edward Northey, attorney-general; Sir Simon Harcourt, sollic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>or-general; Sir John Cook; and Stephen Waller, doctor of laws—The Scot<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sh commissioners were, James Earl of Seafield, lord chancellor of Scotland; James Duke of Queensberry, lord privy-seal; John Earl of Mar, and Hugh Earl of Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>don, principal secretaries of state; John Earl of Sutherland, John Earl of Morton, David Earl of Wemys, David Earl of Leven, John Earl of Stair, Archibald Earl of Roseberry, David Earl of Glasgow, Lord Archibald Campbell, Thomas Viscount Duplin, Lord William Ross, Sir Hugh D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lrymple, president of the session; Adam Cockburn, of Ormistoun, lord justice-clerk; Sir Robert Dundass, of Arnistoun, Robert Stuart, of Tillicultrie, lords of the session; Mr. Francis Montgomery, one of the commissioners of the Treasury; Sir David Dalrymple, one of her Majesty's sollicitors; Sir Alexander Ogilvie, receiver general; Sir Patrick Johnston, provost of Edinburgh; Sir James Smollet, of Bonhill; George Lockhart, of Carnwath; William Morrison, of Prestongrange; Alexander Grant; William Seton, of Pitmidden; John Clark, of Pennycook; Hugh Montgomery, Da∣niel Stuart, and Daniel Campbell.</NOTE> on both sides, they met on
<PB N="70" REF="74"/>
the sixteenth day of April,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1706.</NOTE> in the council-chamber of the
Cockpit near Whitehall, which was the place appointed
for the conferences. Their commissions being opened
and read by the respective secretaries, and introductory
speeches being pronounced by the Lord-Keeper of Eng∣land,
and the Lord-Chancellor of Scotland, they agreed
to certain preliminary articles, importing, That all the
proposals should be made in writing, and every point,
when agreed, reduced to writing; That no points should
be obligatory, till all matters should be adjusted in such
a manner as would be proper to be laid before the Queen,
and the two parliaments, for their approbation: That a
committee should be appointed from each commission, to
revise the minutes of what might pass, before they should
be inserted in the books by the respective secretaries; and
that all the proceedings during the treaty should be kept
secret. The Scots were inclined to a foederal union,
like that of the United Provinces; but the English were
bent upon an incorporation, so as that no Scottish parlia∣ment
should ever have power to repeal the articles of the
treaty. The Lord-Keeper proposed that the two king∣doms
of England and Scotland should be for ever united
into one realm, by the name of Great-Britain; That it
should be represented by one and the same parliament;
and, That the succession of this monarchy, failing heirs
of her Majesty's body, should be according to the limita∣tions
mentioned in the act of parliament passed in the
reign of King William, intituled, An act for the further
<PB N="71" REF="75"/>
limitation of the crown,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VIII. 1706.</NOTE> and the better securing the
rights and liberties of the subject. The Scottish com∣missioners,
in order to comply in some measure with the
popular clamour of their nation, presented a proposal, im∣plying
that the succession to the crown of Scotland should
be established upon the same persons mentioned in the act
of King William's reign: That the subjects of Scotland
should for ever enjoy all the rights and privileges of the
natives in England, and the dominions thereunto belong∣ing;
and, That the subjects of England should enjoy the
like rights and privileges in Scotland: That there should
be a free communication and intercourse of trade and na∣vigation
between the two kingdoms, and plantations
thereunto belonging; and that all laws and statutes in
either kingdom, contrary to the terms of this union,
should be repealed. The English commissioners declined
entering into any considerations upon these proposals, de∣claring
themselves fully convinced that nothing but an
entire union could settle a perfect and lasting friendship
between the two kingdoms. The Scots acquiesced in this
reply, and both sides proceeded in the treaty, without any
other intervening dispute. They were twice visited by the
Queen, who exhorted them to accelerate the articles of a
treaty that would prove so advantageous to both kingdoms.
At length they were finished, arranged, and mutually
signed, on the twenty-second of July, and next day pre∣sented
to her Majesty, at the palace of St. James's, by
the Lord-Keeper, in the name of the English commis∣sioners;
at the same time a sealed copy of the instrument
was likewise delivered by the Lord Chancellor of Scot∣land;
and each made a short oration on the subject, to
which the Queen returned a very gracious reply. That
same day she dictated an order of council, that whoever
should be concerned in any discourse or libel, or in laying
wagers relating to the union, should be prosecuted with
the utmost rigour of the law.</P>
<P>§ XLV. In this famous treaty it was stipulated, That
the succession to the united kingdom of Great-Britain
<PB N="72" REF="76"/>
should be vested in the Princess Sophia, and her heirs,
according to the acts already passed in the parliament of
England: That the united kingdom should be represented
by one and the same parliament: That all the subjects of
Great-Britain should enjoy a communication of privileges
and advantages: That they should have the same allow∣ances,
encouragements, and drawbacks; and be under
the same prohibitions, restrictions, and regulations, with
respect to commerce and customs; That Scotland should
not be charged with the temporary duties on some certain
commodities; That the sum of three hundred, ninety-eight
thousand and eighty-five pounds, ten shillings,
should be granted to the Scots, as an equivalent for such
parts of the customs and excise charged upon that kingdom,
in consequence of the union, as would be applicable to the
payment of the debts of England, according to the pro∣portion
which the customs and excise of Scotland bore to
those of England; That, as the revenues of Scotland
might increase, a further equivalent should be allowed for
such proportion of the said increase as should be applicable
to the payment of the debts of England; That the sum
to be paid at present, as well as the monies arising from
the future equivalents, should be employed in reducing
the coin of Scotland to the standard and value of the
English coin; in paying off the capital stock and interest
due to the proprietors of the African company, which
should be immediately dissolved; in discharging all the
publick debts of the kingdom of Scotland; in promoting
and encouraging manufactures and fisheries, under the
direction of commissioners to be appointed by her Majesty,
and accountable to the parliament of Great-Britain; That
the laws concerning public right, policy, and civil go∣vernment,
should be the same throughout the whole united
kingdom; but that no alteration should be made in laws
which concerned private right, except for evident utility
of the subjects within Scotland; That the court of session,
and all other courts of judicature in Scotland, should re∣main
as then constituted by the laws of that kingdom,
<PB N="73" REF="77"/>
with the same authority and privileges as before the union;
subject, nevertheless, to such regulations as should be
made by the parliament of Great-Britain; That all heri∣table
offices, superiorities, heritable jurisdictions, offices
for life, and jurisdictions for life, should be reserved to
the owners, as rights of property, in the same manner as
then enjoyed by the laws of Scotland; That the rights
and privileges of the royal boroughs in Scotland should
remain entire after the union; That Scotland should be
represented in the parliament of Great-Britain by sixteen
peers and forty-five commoners, to be elected in such a
manner as should be settled by the present parliament of
Scotland; That all peers of Scotland, and the successors
to their honours and dignities, should, from and after the
union, be peers of Great-Britain, and should have rank
and precedency next and immediately after the English
peers of the like orders and degrees at the time of the union;
and before all peers of Great-Britain of the like orders and
degrees, who might be created after the union; That they
should be tried as peers of Great-Britain, and enjoy all
privileges of peers, as fully as enjoyed by the peers of Eng∣land,
except the right and privilege of sitting in the
House of Lords, and the privileges depending thereon,
and particularly the right of sitting upon the trials of peers;
That the crown, sceptre, and sword of state, the records
of parliament, and all other records, rolls, and registers
whatsoever, should remain as they were, within that
part of the united kingdom called Scotland; That all
laws and statutes in either kingdom, so far as they might
be inconsistent with the terms of these articles, should
cease and be declared void by the respective parliaments of
the two kingdoms—Such is the substance of that treaty
of an union which was so eagerly courted by the English
ministry, and proved so unpalatable to the generality of
the Scottish nation.</P>

<P>§ I. WHILE this treaty was on the carpet at home,
the allied arms prospered surprisingly in the
Netherlands, in Spain, and in Piedmont. The French
King had resolved to make very considerable efforts in
these countries; and, indeed, at the beginning of the cam∣paign
his armies were very formidable. He hoped that,
by the reduction of Turin and Barcelona, the war would
be extinguished in Italy and Catalonia. He knew he
could out number any body of forces that Prince Louis of
Baden should assemble on the Rhine; and he resolved to
re-enfoce his army in Flanders, so as to be in a condition
to act offensively against the Duke of Marlborough. This
nobleman repaired to Holland in the latter end of April;
and conferred with the States-General. Then he assem∣bled
the army between Borschloen and Groes-Waren, and
found it amounted to seventy-four battalions of foot, and
one hundred and twenty-three squadrons of horse and
dragoons, well surnished with artillery and pontoons.
The court of France having received intelligence that
the Danish and Prussian troops had not yet joined the
consederates, ordered the Elector of Bavaria and the Marc∣schal
de Villeroy to attack them before the junction could
be effected. In pursuance of this order they passed the
Deule on the nineteenth day of May, and posted themselves
<PB N="76" REF="80"/>
at Tirlemont, being superior in number to the allied army.
There they were joined by the horse of the army, com∣manded
by the Mareschal Marsin, and encamped between
Tirlemont and Judoigne. On Whitsunday, early in the
morning, the Duke of Marlborough advanced with his
army in eight columns towards the village of Ramillies,
being by this time joined by the Danes; and he learned
that the enemy were in march to give him battale. Next
day the French generals perceiving the confederates so near
them, took possession of a strong camp, their right extend∣ing
to the Tomb of Hauntemont, on the side of the Me∣haigne;
their left to Anderkirk; and the village of
Ramillies being near their centre. The confederate army
was drawn up in order of battle, with the right wing near
Foltz on the brook of Yause, and the left by the village
of Franquenies, which the enemy had occupied. The
Duke ordered Lieutenant-General Schultz, with twelve
battalions and twenty pieces of cannon, to begin the action,
by attacking Ramillies, which was strongly fortified with
artillery. At the same time Velt-Mareschal D'Auverquer∣que,
on the left, commanded Colonel Wertmuller, with
four battalions and two pieces of cannon, to dislodge the
enemy's infantry posted among the hedges of Franquenies.
Both these orders were successfully executed. The Dutch
and Danish horse of the left wing charged with great vi∣gour
and intrepidity, but were so roughly handled by the
troops of the French King's household, that they began
to give way, when the Duke of Marlborough sustained
them with the body of reserve, and twenty squadrons
drawn from the right, where a morass prevented them
from acting. In the mean time, he in person rallied some
of the broken squadrons, in order to renew the charge,
when his own horse falling, he was surrounded by the
enemy, and must have been either killed or taken pri∣soner,
had not a body of infantry come seasonably to his
relief. When he remounted his horse, the head of Colonel
Briensield, his gentleman of the horse, was carried off by a
cannon-ball while he held the Duke's stirrup. Before the
<PB N="77" REF="81"/>
re-enforcement arrived, the best part of the French mous∣quetaires
were cut in pieces. All the troops posted in Ra∣millies
were either killed or taken. The rest of the ene∣my's
infantry began to retreat in tolerable order, under
cover of the cavalry on their left wing, which formed
themselves in three lines between Ossuz and Anderkirk:
but the English horse having found means to pass the
rivulet which divided them from the enemy, fell upon them
with such impetuosity, that they abandoned their foot,
and were terribly slaughtered in the village of Anderkirk.
They now gave way on all sides. The horse fled three
different ways: but were so closely pursued, that very
few escaped. The Elector of Bavaria and the Mareschal
de Villeroy saved themselves with the utmost difficulty.
Several waggons of the enemy's van-guard breaking down
in a narrow pass, obstructed the way in such a manner,
that the baggage and artillery could not proceed; nor
could their troops defile in order. The victorious horse
being informed of this accident, pressed on them so vigo∣rously,
that great numbers threw down their arms and
submitted. The pursuit was followed through Judoigne
till two o'clock in the morning, five leagues from the field
of battle, and within two of Louvaine. In a word, the
confederates obtained a complete victory. They took the
enemy's baggage and artillery, about one hundred and
twenty colours, or standards, six hundred officers, six
thousand private soldiers; and about eight thousand were
killed or wounded.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French impute the loss of this battle to the misconduct of Villeroy, who, it must be owned, made a most wretched disposition. When he re∣turned to Versailles, where he expected to meet with nothing but reproaches, Louis received him without the least mark of displeasure, saying, “Mr. Mareschal, you and I are too old to be fortunate.”</NOTE> Prince Maximilian and Prince
Monbason lost their lives: the Major-Generals Palavicini
and Mezieres were taken, together with the Marquisses
de Bar, de Nonant, and de la Baume, this last the son
of the Mareschal de Tallard, Monsieur de Montmorency,
nephew to the Duke of Luxembourg, and many other
persons of distinction. The loss of the allies did not exceed
<PB N="78" REF="82"/>
three thousand men, including Prince Louis of Hesse, and
Mr. Bentick, who were slain in the engagement. The
French generals retired with precipitation to Brussels,
while the allies took possession of Louvaine, and next day
encamped at Bethlem. The battle of Ramillies was at∣tended
with the immediate conquest of all Brabant. The
cities of Louvaine, Mechlin, Brussels, Antwerp, Ghent,
and Bruges submitted without resistance, and acknow∣ledged
King Charles. Ostend, though secured by a strong
garrison, was surrendered after a siege of ten days. Me∣nin,
esteemed the most finished fortification in the Ne∣therlands,
and guarded by six thousand men, met with the
same fate. The garrison of Dendermonde surrendered
themselves prisoners of war; and Aeth submitted on the same
conditions. The French troops were dispirited. The
city of Paris was overwhelmed with consternation. Louis
affected to bear his misfortunes with calmness and com∣posure:
but the constraint had such an effect upon his
constitution, that his physicians thought it necessary to pre∣scribe
frequent bleeding, which he accordingly underwent.
At his court no mention was made of military transactions:
all was solemn, silent and reserved.</P>
<P>§ II. Had the issue of the campaign in Catalonia been
such as the beginning seemed to prognosticate, the French
King might have in some measure consoled himself for his
disgraces in the Netherlands. On the sixth day of April
King Philip, at the head of a numerous army, undertook
the siege of Barcelona, while the Count de Tholouse
blocked it up with a powerful squadron. The inhabi∣tants,
animated by the presence of King Charles, made a
vigorous defence; and the garrison was re-enforced with
some troops from Gironne and other places. But, after
the sort of Montjuic was taken, the place was so hard
pressed, that Charles ran the utmost risque of falling into
the hands of the enemy; for the Earl of Peterborough,
who had marched from Valencia with two thousand men,
sound it impracticable to enter the city. Nevertheless, he
maintained his post upon the hills; and, with surprising
<PB N="79" REF="83"/>
courage and activity, kept the besiegers in continual alarm.
At length, Sir John Leake sailed from Lisbon with thirty
ships of the line; and on the eighth day of May arrived
in sight of Barcelona. The French admiral no sooner
received intelligence of his approach, than he set sail for
Toulon. In three days after his departure, King Philip
abandoned the siege, and retired in great disorder, leaving
behind his tents, with the sick and wounded. On the
side of Portugal the Duke of Berwick was left with such
an inconsiderable force as proved insufficient to defend the
frontiers. The Earl of Galway, with an army of twenty
thousand men, undertook the siege of Alcantara; and in
three days the garrison, consisting of four thousand men,
were made prisoners of war. Then he marched to Pla∣centia,
and advanced as far the bridge of Almaras: but
the Portuguese would penetrate no farther until they should
know the fate of Barcelona. When they understood the
siege was raised, they consented to proceed to Madrid,
Philip guessing their intention, posted to that capital, and
sent his Queen with all his valuable effects to Burgos,
whither he followed her in person, after having destroyed
every thing that he could not carry away. About the latter
end of June the Earl of Galway entered the city without
resistance: but the Spaniards were extremely mortified to
see an army of Portuguese, headed by an heretick, in pos∣session
of their capital. King Charles loitered away his
time in Barcelona, until his competitor recovered his spirits,
and received such re-enforcements as enabled him to return
to Madrid, with an army equal to that commanded by
the Earl of Galway. This general made a motion to∣wards
Arragon, in order to facilitate his conjunction with
Charles, who had set out by the way of Saragossa, where
he was acknowledged as sovereign of Arragon and Valen∣cia.
In the beginning of August this prince arrived at the
Portuguese camp, with a small re-enforcement; and in
a few days was followed by the Earl of Peterborough, at
the head of sive hundred dragoons. The two armies were
now pretty equal in point of number; but as each expected
<PB N="80" REF="84"/>
further re-enforcements, neither chose to hazard an en∣gagement.
The Earl of Peterborough, who aspired to
the chief command, and hated the Prince of Lichtenstein,
who enjoyed the confidence of King Charles, retired in
disgust; and, embarking on board an English ship of
war, set sail for Genoa. The English fleet continued all
the summer in the Mediterranean: they secured Cartha∣gena,
which had declared for Charles: they took the town
of Alicant by assault, and the castle by capitulation. Then
sailing out of the straits, one squadron was detached to
the West-Indies, another ordered to lie at Lisbon, and the
rest were sent home to England.</P>
<P>§ III. Fortune was not more propitious to the French
in Italy than in Flanders. The Duke de Vendome having
been recalled to assume the command in Flanders after the
battle of Ramillies, the Duke of Orleans was placed at the
head of the army in Piedmont, under the tutorage and
direction of the Mareschal de Marsin. They were order∣ed
to besiege Turin, which was accordingly invested in
the month of May; and the operations carried on till
the beginning of September. Great preparations had been
made for this siege. It was not undertaken until the
Duke of Savoy had rejected all the offers of the French
monarch, which were suffic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent to have shaken a prince
of less courage and fortitude. The Duke de la Feuillade
having finished the lines of circumvallation and contra∣vallation,
sent his quarter-master general with a trumpet,
to offer passports and a guard for the removal of the Du∣chess
and her children. The Duke of Savoy replied, that he
did not intend to remove his family, and that the Mare∣schal
might begin to execute his master's orders whenever
he should think fit: but, when the siege began with un∣common
fury, and the French fired red-hot balls into the
place, the two duchesses, with the young prince and
princesses, quitted Turin, and retired to Quierasco, from
whence they were conducted through many dangers into
the territories of Genoa. The Duke himself forsook his
capital, in order to put himself at the head of his cavalry;
<PB N="81" REF="85"/>
and was pursued from place to place by five-and-forty
squadrons, under the command of the Count D'Aubeterre.
Notwithstanding the very noble defence which was made
by the garrison of Turin, which destroyed fourteen thou∣sand
of the enemy during the course of the siege, the de∣fences
were almost ruined, their ammunition began to fail,
and they had no prospect of relief but from Prince Eugene,
who had numberless difficulties to encounter before he could
march to their assistance. The Duke de Vendome, before
he left Italy, had secured all the fords of the Adige, the
Minicio, and the Oglio, and formed such lines and en∣trechments
as he imagined would effectually hinder the
Imperial general from arriving in time to relieve the city
of Turin. But the Prince surmounted all opposition;
passed four great rivers in despite of the enemy; and reach∣ed
the neighbourhood of Turin on the thirteenth day of
August. There being joined by the Duke of Savoy, he
passed the Po between Montcalier and Cavignan. On the
fifth day of September they took a convoy of eight hun∣dred
loaded mules: next day they passed the Doria, and
encamped with the right on the bank of that river before
Pianessa, and the left on the Stura before the Veneria.
The enemy were entrenched, having the Stura on their
right, the Doria on their left, and the convent of capu∣chins,
called Notre Dame de la Campagne, in their centre.
When Prince Eugehe approached Turin, the Duke of
Orleans proposed to march out of the entrenchments, and
give him battle; and this proposal was seconded by all the
general-officers, except Marsin, who, finding the Duke
determined, produced an order from the French King,
commanding the Duke to follow the Mareschal's advice.
The court of Versailles was now become afraid of hazard∣ing
an engagement against those who had so often de∣feated
their armies; and this officer had private instruc∣tions
to keep within the trenches. On the seventh day of
September the confederates marched up to the entrench∣ments
of the French, in eight columns, through a terrible
fire from forty pieces of artillery, and were formed in order
<PB N="80" REF="86"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="81" REF="87"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="82" REF="88"/>
of battle within half-cannon shot of the enemy. Then
they advanced to the attack with surprising resolution, and
met with such a warm reception as seemed to stop their
progress. Prince Eugene perceiving this check, drew his
sword, and putting himself at the head of the battalions on
the left, forced the entrenchments at the first charge.
The Duke of Savoy met with the same success in the cen∣tre,
and on the right near Lucengo. The horse advanced
through the intervals of the foot, left for that purpose;
and breaking in with vast impetuosity, completed the con∣fusion
of the enemy, who were defeated on all hands, and
retired with precipitation to the other side of the Po, while
the Duke of Savoy entered his capital in triumph. The
Duke of Orleans exhibited repeated proofs of the most
intrepid courage; and received several wounds in the en∣gagement.
Mareschal de Marsin fell into the hands of
the victors, his thigh being shattered with a ball, and died
in a few hours after the amputation. Of the French army
about five thousand men were slain on the field of battle:
a great number of officers, and upwards of seven thousand
men were taken, together with two hundred and fifty-five
pieces of cannon, one hundred and eighty mortars, an in∣credible
quantity of ammunition, all the tents and baggage,
five thousand beasts of burthen, ten thousand horses be∣longing
to thirteen regiments of dragoons, and the mules
of the commissary-general, so richly laden, that this part
of the booty alone was valued at three millions of livres.
The loss of the confederates did not exceed three thousand
men killed or disabled in the action, besides about the
same number at the garrison of Turin, which had fallen
since the beginning of the siege. This was such a fatal
stroke to the interest of Louis, that Madame de Maintenon
would not venture to make him fully acquainted with the
state of his affairs. He was told that the Duke of Orleans
had raised the siege of Turin at the approach of Prince
Eugene; but he knew not that his own army was defeated
and ruined. The spirits of the French were a little com∣forted
in consequence of an advantage gained about this
<PB N="83" REF="89"/>
time, by the Count de Medavi-grancey, who commanded
a body of troops left in the Mantuan territories. He
surprised the Prince of Hesse in the neighbourhood of
Castiglione, and obliged him to retire to the Adige, with
the loss of two thousand men: but this victory was at∣tended
with no consequence in their favour. The Duke
of Orleans retreated into Dauphin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, while the French
garrisons were driven out of every place they occupied in
Piedmont and Italy, except Cremona, Valenza, and the
castle of Milan, which were blocked up by the confe∣derates.</P>
<P>§ IV. Over and above these disasters which the French
sustained in the course of this campaign, they were mise∣rably
alarmed by the project of an invasion from Britain,
formed by the Marquis de Guiscard, who, actuated by a
family disgust, had abandoned his country, and become a
partisan of the confederates. He was declared a lieute∣nant-general
in the Emperor's army, and came over to
London, after having settled a correspondence with the
malcontents in the southern parts of France. He insi∣nuated
himself into the friendship of Henry St. John,
secretary of war, and other persons of distinction. His
scheme of invading France was approved by the British
ministry, and he was promoted to the command of a regi∣ment
of dragoons destined for that service. About eleven
thousand men were embarked under the conduct of Earl
Rivers, with a large train of artillery; and the combined
squadrons, commanded by Sir Cloudesley Shovel, set sail
from Plymouth on the thirteenth day of August. Next
day they were forced into Torbay by contrary winds;
and there they held a council of war to concert their ope∣rations,
when they discovered that Guiscard's plan was
altogether chimerical, or at least founded upon such slight
assurances and conjectures as could not justify their pro∣ceeding
to execution. An express was immediately dis∣patched
to the Admiralty, with the result of this council;
and, in the mean time, letters arrived at court from the
Earl of Galway, after his retreat from Madrid to Valencia,
<PB N="84" REF="90"/>
solliciting succours with the most earnest entreaties. The
expedition to France was immediately postponed; and
Sir Cloudesley Shovel was ordered to make the best of his
way for Lisbon, there to take such measures as the state
of the war in Spain should render necessary. Guiscard
and his officers being set on shore, the fleet sailed with the
first fair wind, and towards the latter end of October ar∣rived
at Lisbon. On the twenty-eighth day of the next
month the King of Portugal died, and his eldest son and
successor being but eighteen years of age, was even more
than his father influenced by a ministry which had private
connexions with the court of Versailles. Nevertheless,
Sir Cloudesley Shovel and Earl Rivers, being pressed by
letters from King Charles and the Earl of Galway, sailed
to their assistance in the beginning of January; and on
the twenty-eighth arrived at Alicant, from whence the
Earl of Rivers proceeded by land to Valencia, in order to
assist at a general council of war. The operations of the
ensuing campaign being concerted, and the army joined
by the re-enforcement from England, Earl Rivers disliking
the country, returned with the Admiral to Lisbon.</P>
<P>§ V. Poland was at length delivered from the presence
of the King of Sweden, who in the beginning of Septem∣ber
suddenly marched though Lusatia into Saxony; and
in a little time laid that whole electorate under contribu∣tion.
Augustus being thus cut off from all resource,
resolved to obtain peace on the Swede's own terms,
and engaged in a secret treaty for this purpose. In the
mean time the Poles and Muscovites attacked the Swedish
forces at Kalish in Great Poland; and by dint of numbers
routed them with great slaughter. Notwithstanding this
event, Augustus ratified the treaty, by which he acknow∣ledged
Stanislaus as true and rightful King of Poland, re∣serving
to himself no more than the empty title of sove∣reign.
The confederates were not a little alarmed to find
Charles in the heart of Germany; and the French court
did not fail to court his alliance: but he continued on the
reserve against all their sollicitations. Then they im∣plored
<PB N="85" REF="91"/>
his mediation for a peace; and he answered, that he
would interpose his good offices, as soon as he should know
they would be agreeable to the powers engaged in the
grand alliance.</P>
<P>§ VI. The pride of Louis was now humbled to such a
degree as might have excited the compassion of his ene∣mies.
He employed the Elector of Bavaria to write letters
in his name to the Duke of Marlborough and the deputies
of the States-General, containing proposals for opening a
congress. He had already tampered with the Dutch, in a
memorial presented by the Marquis d'Alegre. He like∣wise
besought the Pope to interpose in his behalf. He
offered to cede either Spain and the West-Indies, or Milan,
Naples, and Sicily to King Charles; to give up a barrier
for the Dutch in the Netherlands; and to indemnify the
Duke of Savoy for the ravages that had been committed
in his dominions. Though his real aim was peace, yet
he did not despair of being able to excite such jealousies
among the confederates as might shake the basis of their
union. His hope was not altogether disappointed. The
court of Vienna was so much alarmed at the offers he had
made, and the reports circulated by his emissaries, that
the Emperor resolved to make himself master of Naples
before the allies should have it in their power to close with
the proposals of France. This was the true motive of his
concluding a treaty with Louis in the succeeding winter,
by which the Milanese was entirely evacuated, and the
French King at liberty to employ those troops in making
strong efforts against the confederates in Spain and the
Netherlands. The Dutch were intoxicated with success,
and their Pensionary, Heinsius, entirely influenced by the
Duke of Marlborough, who found his account in the con∣tinuance
of the war, which at once gratified his avarice
and ambition; for all his great qualities were obscured by
the sordid passion of accumulating wealth. During the
whole war the allies never had such an opportunity as they
now enjoyed to bridle the power of France effectually,
and secure the liberties of the empire; and indeed, if their
<PB N="86" REF="92"/>
real design was to establish an equal balance between the
houses of Austria and Bourbon, it could not have been
better effected than by dividing the Spanish monarchy
between these two potentates. The accession of Spain,
with all its appendages, to either, would have destroyed
the equilibrium which the allies proposed to establish.
But other motives contributed to a continuation of the
war. The powers of the confederacy were fired with the
ambition of making conquests; and England in particular
thought herself entitled to an indemnification for the im∣mense
sums she had expended. Animated by these con∣curring
considerations, Queen Anne and the States-Ge∣neral
rejected the offers of France; and declared, that they
would not enter into any negociation for peace, except in
concert with their allies.</P>
<P>§ VII. The Tories of England began to meditate
schemes of opposition against the Duke of Marlborough.
They looked upon him as a selfish nobleman, who sacri∣ficed
the interest of the nation, in protracting a ruinous
war for his own private advantage. They saw their country
oppressed with an increasing load of taxes, which they ap∣prehended
would in a little time become an intolerable
burthen; and they did not doubt but at this period such
terms might be obtained as would fully answer the great
purpose of the confederacy. This, indeed, was the pre∣vailing
opinion among all the sensible people of the nation
who were not particularly interested in the prosecution of
the war, either by being connected with the General, or
in some shape employed in the management of the finances.
The Tories were likewise instigated by a party-spirit
against Marlborough, who, by means of his wife, was
in full possession of the Queen's confidence, and openly
patronised the Whig faction. But the attention of people
in general was now turned upon the Scottish parliament,
which took into consideration the treaty of union lately
concluded between the commissioners of both kingdoms.
On the third day of October, the Duke of Queensberry, as
high-commissioner, produced the Queen's letter, in which
<PB N="87" REF="93"/>
she expressed her hope, that the terms of the treaty would
be acceptable to her parliament of Scotland. She said, an
entire and perfect union would be the solid foundation of a
lasting peace; it would secure their religion, liberty, and
property, remove the animosities that prevailed among
themselves, and the jealousies that subsisted between the
two nations; it would increase their strength, riches, and
commerce; the whole island would be joined in affection,
and free from all apprehension of different interests; it
would be enabled to resist all its enemies, support the pro∣testant
interest every where, and maintain the liberties of
Europe. She renewed her assurance of maintaining the
government of their church; and told them, that now
they had an opportunity of taking such steps as might be
necessary for its security after the union. She demanded
the necessary supplies. She observed, that the great suc∣cess
with which God Almighty had blessed her arms af∣forded
the nearer prospect of a happy peace, with which
they would enjoy the full advantages of this union; that
they had no reason to doubt but the parliament of England
would do all that should be necessary on their part to con∣firm
the union; finally, she recommended calmness and
unanimity in deliberating on this great and weighty affair,
of such consequence to the whole island of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>§ VIII. Hitherto the articles of the union had been in∣dustriously
concealed from the knowledge of the people;
but the treaty being recited in parliament, and the parti∣culars
divulged, such a slame was kindled through the
whole nation, as had not appeared since the Restoration.
The cavaliers or Jacobites had always foreseen that this
union would extinguish all their hopes of a revolution in
favour of a pretender. The nobility found themselves de∣graded
in point of dignity and influence, by being ex∣cluded
from their seats in parliament. The trading part
of the nation beheld their commerce saddled with heavy
duties and restrictions, and considered the privilege of
trading to the English-plantations as a precarious and un∣certain
prospect of advantage. The barons or gentlemen
<PB N="88" REF="94"/>
were exasperated at a coalition, by which their parliament
was annihilated, and their credit destroyed. The people in
general exclaimed, that the dignity of their crown was
betrayed; that the independency of their nation had fallen
a sacrifice to treachery and corruption; that whatever
conditions might be speciously offered, they could not
expect they would be observed by a parliament in which
the English had such a majority. They exaggerated the
dangers to which the constitution of their church would
be exposed from a bench of bishops, and a parliament of
episcopalians This consideration alarmed the presbyte∣rian
ministers to such a degree, that they employed all
their power and credit in waking the resentment of their
hearers against the treaty, which produced an universal
ferment among all ranks of people. Even the most rigid
puritans joined the cavaliers in expressing their detestation
of the union; and, laying aside their mutual animosities,
promised to co-operate in opposing a measure so ignomi∣nious
and prejudicial to their country. In parliament the
opposition was headed by the Dukes of Hamilton and
Athol, and the Marquis of Annandale. The first of
these noblemen had wavered so much in his conduct, that
it is difficult to ascertain his real political principles. He
was generally supposed to favour the claim of the Pre∣tender;
but he was afraid of embarking too far in his
cause, and avoided violent measures in the discussion of
this treaty, lest he should incur the resentment of the
English parliament, and forfeit the estate he possessed in
that kingdom. Athol was moe forward in his professions
of attachment to the court of St. Germain's; but he had
less ability, and his zeal was supposed to have been in∣flamed
by resentment against the ministry. The debates
upon the different articles of the treaty were carried on
with great heat and vivacity; and many shrewd arguments
were used against this scheme of an incorporating union.
One member affirmed, that it would furnish a handle to
any aspiring prince to overthrow the liberties of all Bri∣tain;
for if the parliament of Scotland could alter, or
<PB N="89" REF="95"/>
rather subvert its constitution, this circumstance might be
a precedent for the parliament of Great-Britain to assume
the same power; that the representatives for Scotland,
would, from their poverty, depend upon those who pos∣sessed
the means of corruption; and having expressed so
little concern for the support of their own constitution,
would pay very little regard to that of any other. “What!
(said the Duke of Hamilton) shall we in half an hour
give up what our forefathers maintained with their
lives and fortunes for many ages? Are here none of the
descendants of those worthy patriots, who defended the
liberty of their country against all invaders; who assisted
the great king Robert Bruce to restore the constitution,
and revenge the falsehood of England, and the usurpa∣tion
of Baliol? Where are the Douglasses and Camp∣bells?
Where are the peers, where are the barons,
once the bulwark of the nation? Shall we yield up the
sovereignty and independency of our country, when we
are commanded by those we represent to preserve the
same, and assured of their assistance to support us?”
The Duke of Athol protested against an incorporating
union, as contrary to the honour, interest, fundamental
law, and constitution of the kingdom of Scotland, the
birthright of the peers, the rights and privileges of the
barons and boroughs, and to the claim of right, property,
and liberty of the subjects. To this protest nineteen peers
and forty-six commoners adhered. The Earl Marischal
entered a protest, importing that no person being suc∣cessor
to the crown of England should inherit that of
Scotland, without such previous limitations as might se∣cure
the honour and sovereignty of the Scottish crown
and kingdom, the frequency and power of parliament, the
religion, liberty, and trade of the nation, from English
or any foreign influence. He was seconded by six-and-forty
members. With regard to the third article of the
union, stipulating, that both kingdoms should be repre∣sented
by one and the same parliament, the country-party
observed, that, by assenting to this expedient, they did in
<PB N="90" REF="96"/>
effect sink their own constitution, while that of England
underwent no alteration; that in all nations there are
fundamentals, which no power whatever can alter; that
the rights and privileges of parliament being one of these
fundamentals among the Scots, no parliament, or any
other power, could ever legally prohibit the meeting of
parliaments, or deprive any of the three estates of its right
of sitting or voting in parliament, or give up the rights
and privileges of parliament; but that by this treaty the
parliament of Scotland was entirely abrogated, its rights
and privileges sacrificed, and those of the English parlia∣ment
substituted in their place. They argued, that though
the legislative power in parliament was regulated and de∣termined
by a majority of voices; yet the giving up the
constitution, with the rights and privileges of the nation,
was not subject to suffrage, being founded on dominion
and property; and therefore could not be legally surren∣dered
without the consent of every person who had a right
to elect and be represented in parliament. They affirmed
that the obligation laid on the Scottish members to reside
so long in London, in attendance on the British parliament,
would drain Scotland of all its money, impoverish the
members, and subject them to the temptation of being
corrupted. Another protest was entered by the Marquis
of Annandale against an incorporating union, as being
odious to the people, subversive of the constitution, sove∣reignty,
and claim of right, and threatening ruin to the
church as by law established. Fifty-two members joined in
this protestation. Almost every article produced the most
inflammatory disputes. The Lord Belhaven enumerated
the mischiefs which would attend the union, in a pa∣thetick
speech, that drew tears from the audience, and is
at this day looked upon as a prophecy by great part of the
Scottish nation. Addresses against the treaty, were pre∣sented
to parliament by the convention of boroughs, the
commissioners of the general-assembly, the company trading
to Africa and the Indies, as well as from several shires,
stewartries, boroughs, towns, and parishes, in all the
<PB N="91" REF="97"/>
different parts of the kingdom, without distinction of Whig
or Tory, episcopalian or presbyterian. The Earl of Buchan
for the peers, Lockhart of Carnwath for the barons, Sir
Walter Stuart in behalf of the peers, barons, and boroughs;
the Earls of Errol and Marischal for themselves, as high∣constable
and earl-marshal of the kingdom, protested seve∣rally
against the treaty of union.</P>
<P>§ IX. While this opposition raged within doors, the
resentment of the people rose to transports of fury and
revenge. The more rigid presbyterians, known by the
name of Cameronians, chose officers, formed themselves
into regiments, provided horses, arms, and ammunition,
and marching to Dumfries, burned the articles of the
union at the market-cross, justifying their conduct in a
public declaration. They made a tender of their attach∣ment
to Duke Hamilton, from whom they received en∣couragement
in secret. They reconciled themselves to
the episcopalians and the cavaliers; they resolved to
take the route to Edinburgh, and dissolve the parliament;
while the Duke of Athol undertook to secure the pass
of Sterling with his Highlanders, so as to open the com∣munication
between the western and northern parts of the
kingdom. Seven or eight thousand men were actually
ready to appear in arms at the town of Hamilton, and
march directly to Edinburgh, under the Duke's command,
when that nobleman altered his opinion, and dispatched
private couriers through the whole country, requiring the
people to defer their meeting till further directions. The
more sanguine cavaliers accused his grace of treachery;
but in all likelihood he was actuated by prudential motives.
He alledged, in his own excuse, that the nation was not
in a condition to carry on such an enterprise, especially
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the English had already detached troops to the border,
and might in a few days have wafted over a considerable
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e-enforcement from Holland. During this commotion
among the Cameronians, the cities of Edinburgh and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lasgow were filled with tumults. Sir Patrick Johnston,
rovost of Edinburgh, who had been one of the com∣missioners
<PB N="92" REF="98"/>
for the union, was besieged in his own house,
by the populace, and would have been torn in pieces, had
not the guards dispersed the multitude. The privy-coun∣cil
issued a proclamation against riots, commanding all
persons to retire from the streets whenever the drum should
beat; ordering the guards to fire upon those who should
disobey this command, and indemnifying them from all
prosecution for maiming or slaying the lieges. These guards
were placed all round the house in which the Peers and Com∣mons
were assembled, and the council received the thanks
of the parliament, for having thus provided for their safety.
Notwithstanding these precautions of the government, the
commissioner was constantly saluted with the curses and
imprecations of the people as he passed along: his guards
were pelted; and some of his attendants wounded with
stones as they sat by him in the coach, so that he was
obliged to pass through the streets in full gallop.</P>
<P>§ X. Against all this national fury, the Dukes of
Queensberry and Argyle, the Earls of Montrose, Seafield,
and Stair, and the other noblemen attached to the union,
acted with equal prudence and resolution. They argued
strenuously against the objections that were started in the
house. They magnified the advantages that would accrue
to the kingdom from the privilege of trading to the Eng∣lish
plantations, and being protected in their commerce
by a powerful navy; as well as from the exclusion of a
popish pretender, who they knew was odious to the nation
in general. They found means, partly by their promises,
and partly by corruption, to bring over the Earls of Rox∣burgh
and Marchmont, with the whole squadron who
had hitherto been unpropitious to the court. They dis∣armed
the resentment of the clergy, by promoting an act
to be inserted in the union, declaring the presbyterian
discipline to be the only government of the church of
Scotland, unalterable in all succeeding times, and a fun∣damental
article of the treaty. They soothed the African
company with the prospect of being indemnified for the
losses they had sustained. They amused individuals with
<PB N="93" REF="99"/>
the hope of sharing the rest of the equivalent. They em∣ployed
emissaries to allay the ferment among the Came∣ronians,
and disunite them from the cavaliers, by canting,
praying, and demonstrating the absurdity, sinfulness, and
danger of such a coalition. These remonstrances were
re-enforced by the sum of twenty thousand pounds, which
the Queen privately lent to the Scottish treasury, and
which was now distributed by the ministry in such a man∣ner
as might best conduce to the success of the treaty.
By these practices they diminished, though they could not
silence the clamour of the people, and obtained a con∣siderable
majority in parliament, which out-voted all
opposition. Not but that the Duke of Queensberry at one
time despaired of succceding, and being in continual ap∣prehension
for his life, expressed a desire of adjourning the
parliament, until by time and good management he should
be able to remove those difficulties that then seemed to be
insurmountable. But the Lord-Treasurer Godolphin, who
foresaw that the measure would be entirely lost by delay,
and was no judge of the difficulties, insisted upon his pro∣ceeding.
It was at this period that he remitted the money,
and gave directions for having forces ready at a call, both
in England and Ireland. At length the Scottish parliament
approved and ratified all the articles of the union, with
some small variation. Then they prepared an act for re∣gulating
the election of the sixteen peers and forty-five
commoners to represent Scotland in the British parliament.
This being touched with the sceptre, the three estates pro∣ceeded
to elect their representatives. The remaining part
of the session was employed in making regulations con∣cerning
the coin, in examining the accounts of their Afri∣can
company, and providing for the due application of
the equivalent, which was scandalously misapplied. On
the twenty-fifth day of March the commissioner adjourned
the parliament, after having in a short speech taken notice
of the honour they had acquired in concluding an affair of
such importance to their country. Having thus accom∣plished
the great purpose of the court, he set out for Lon∣don,
<PB N="94" REF="100"/>
in the neighbourhood of which he was met by above
forty noblemen in their coaches, and about four hundred
gentlemen on horseback. Next day he waited upon the
Queen at Kensington, from whom he met with a very
gracious reception. Perhaps there is not another instance
upon record of a ministry's having carried a point of this
importance against such a violent torrent of opposition,
and contrary to the general sense and inclination of a whole
exasperated people. The Scots were persuaded that their
trade would be destroyed, their nation oppressed, and their
country ruined, in consequence of the union with Eng∣land;
and indeed their opinion was supported by very plau∣sible
arguments. The majority of both nations believed
that the treaty would produce violent convulsions, or at
best prove ineffectual. But we now see it has been at∣tended
with none of the calamities that were prognosti∣cated;
that it quietly took effect, and fully answered all the
purposes for which it was intended. Hence we may learn,
that many great difficulties are surmounted, because they
are not seen by those who direct the execution of any great
project; and that many schemes which theory deems im∣practicable,
will yet succeed in the experiment.</P>
<P>§ XI. The English parliament assembling on the third
day of December, the Queen, in her speech to both Houses,
congratulated them on the glorious successes of her arms.
She desired the Commons would grant such supplies as
might enable her to improve the advantages of this suc∣cessful
campaign. She told them that the treaty of union,
as concluded by the commissioners of both kingdoms,
was at that time under the consideration of the Scottish
parliament; and she recommended dispatch in the publick
affairs, that both friends and enemies might be convinced
of the firmness and vigour of their proceedings. The par∣liament
was perfectly well disposed to comply with all her
Majesty's requests. Warm addresses were presented by
both Houses. Then they proceeded to the consideration
of the supply, and having examined the estimates in less
than a week, voted near six millions for the service of the
<PB N="95" REF="101"/>
ensuing year.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IX. 1706.</NOTE> Nevertheless, in examining the accounts,
some objections arose. They found that the extraordinary
supplies for the support of King Charles of Spain amount∣ed
to eight hundred thousand pounds more than the sums
provided by parliament. Some members argued that very
ill consequences might ensue, if a ministry could thus run
the nation in debt, and expect the parliament should pay
the money. The courtiers answered, that if any thing
had been raised without necessity, or ill-applied, it was rea∣sonable
that those who were in fault should be punished;
but, as this expence was incurred to improve advantages,
at a time when the occasion could not be communicated to
parliament, the ministry was rather to be applauded for
their zeal, than condemned for their liberality. The
question being put, the majority voted that those sums had
been expended for the preservation of the Duke of Savoy,
for the interest of King Charles against the common ene∣my,
and for the safety and honour of the nation. When
the Speaker presented the money-bills, he told her, that
as the glorious victory obtained by the Duke of Marl∣borough
at Ramillies was fought before it could be sup∣posed
the armies were in the field, so it was no less sur∣prising
that the Commons had granted supplies to her Ma∣jesty,
before the enemy could well know that the parlia∣ment
was sitting.—The general was again honoured with
the thanks of both Houses. The Lords in an address,
besought the Queen to settle his honours on his posterity.
An act was passed for this purpose; and, in pursuance of
another address from the Commons, a pension of five
thousand pounds, out of the Post-Office, was settled upon
him and his descendants. The Lords and Commons
having adjourned themselves to the last day of December,
the Queen closed the year with triumphal processions.
As the standards and colours taken at Blenheim had been
placed in Westminster-hall, so now those that had been
brought from the field of Ramillies were put up in Guild∣hall,
as trophies of that victory. About this time, the
Earls of Kent, Lindsay, and Kingston were raised to the
<PB N="96" REF="102"/>
rank of marquisses.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1706.</NOTE> The Lords Wharton, Poulet, Go∣dolphin
and Cholmondeley were created earls. Lord Wal∣den,
son and heir apparent to the Earl of Suffolk, obtained
the title of Earl of Bindon; the Lord-Keeper Cowper and
Sir Thomas Pelham were ennobled as barons.</P>
<P>§ XII. The parliament being assembled after their short
recess, the Earl of Nottingham moved for an address to
the Queen, desiring her Majesty would order the proceed∣ings
of the commissioners for the union, as well as those of
the Scottish parliament on the said subject, to be laid before
them. He was seconded by the Duke of Buckingham
and the Earl of Rochester; and answered by the Earl of
Godolphin, who told them they needed not doubt but that
her Majesty would communicate those proceedings, as
soon as the Scottish parliament should have discussed the
subject of the union. The Lords Wharton, Somers,
and Hallifax observed, that it was for the honour of
the nation that the treaty of union should first come ratified
from the parliament of Scotland; and that then, and not be∣fore,
it would be a proper time for the Lords to take it into
consideration. On the twenty-eighth day of January, the
Queen in person told both Houses, that the treaty of union,
with some additions and alterations, was ratified by an act of
the Scottish parliament: that she had ordered it to be laid
before them; and hoped it would meet with their con∣currence
and approbation. She desired the Commons
would provide for the payment of the equivalent, in case
the treaty should be approved. She observed to both
Houses, that now they had an opportunity of putting the
last hand to a happy union of the two kingdoms; and that
she should look upon it as a particular happiness, if this
great work, which had been so often attempted without
success, could be brought to perfection in her reign.
When the Commons formed themselves into a committee
of the whole House, to deliberate on the articles of the
union, and the Scottish act of ratification, the Tory party,
which was very weak in that assembly, began to start some
objections. Sir John Packington disapproved of this in∣corporating
<PB N="97" REF="103"/>
union, which he likened to a marriage with
a woman against her consent. He said it was an union
carried on by corruption and bribery within doors, by
force and violence without: that the promoters of it had
basely betrayed their trust, in giving up their inde∣pendent
constitution, and he would leave it to the judg∣ment
of the House, to consider whether or no men of
such principles were fit to be admitted into their House of
representatives. He observed, that her Majesty, by the
coronation-oath, was obliged to maintain the church of
England as by law established; and likewise bound by the
same oath to defend the presbyterian kirk of Scotland in
one and the same kingdom. Now (said he) after this union
is in force, who shall administer this oath to her Majesty?
It is not the business of the Scots, who are incapable of it,
and no well-wishers to the church of England. It is
then only the part of the bishops to do it; and can it
be supposed that those reverend persons will, or can, act a
thing so contrary to their own order and institution, as
thus to promote the establishment of the presbyterian
church-government in the united kingdom. He added
that the church of England being established <HI>jure divino,</HI>
and the Scots pretending that the kirk was also <HI>jure divino,</HI>
he could not tell how two nations that clashed in so essen∣tial
an article could unite; he, therefore, thought it proper
to consult the convocation about this critical point. A
motion was made, that the first article of the treaty,
which implies a peremptory agreement to an incorporating
union should be postponed; and that the House should
proceed to the consideration of the terms of the intended
union, contained in the other articles. This proposal
being rejected, some Tory members quitted the House;
and all the articles were examined and approved without
further opposition. The Whigs were so eager in the pro∣secution
of this point, that they proceeded in a very super∣ficial
manner, and with such precipitation as furnished their
enemies with a plausible pretence to affirm that they had
<PB N="98" REF="104"/>
not considered the treaty with the coolness and deliberation
which an affair of this importance required.</P>
<P>§ XIII. Before the Lords began to investigate the arti∣cles
of the union, they, at the instance of the Archbishop
of Canterbury, brought in a bill for the security of the
church of England, to be inserted as a fundamental and
essential part of that treaty. It passed through both Houses
without opposition, and received the royal assent. On
the fifteenth day of February, the debates concerning the
union began in the House of Lords, the Queen being pre∣sent,
and the Bishop of Sarum chairman of the committee.
The Earls of Rochester, Anglesey, and Nottingham ar∣gued
against the union; as did the Bishop of Bath and
Wells. Lord Haversham, in a premeditated harangue,
said the question was, Whether two nations independent
in their sovereignties, that had their distinct laws and
interests, their different forms of worship, church-go∣vernment,
and order, should be united into one kingdom?
He supposed it an union made up of so many mismatched
pieces, of such jarring, incongruous ingredients, that
should it ever take effect, it would carry the necessary
consequence of a standing power and force, to keep them
from falling asunder and breaking in pieces every moment.
He repeated what had been said by Lord Bacon, that an
unity pieced up by direct admission of contrarieties in the
fundamental points of it, is like the toes of Nebuchad∣nezzar's
image, which were made of iron and clay; they
may cleave together, but would never incorporate. He
dissented from the union for the sake of the good old
English constitution, in which he dreaded some alteration
from the additional weight of sixty-one Scottish members,
and these too returned by a Scottish privy-council. He
took notice, that above one hundred Scottish peers, and
as many Commons, were excluded from sitting and voting
in parliament, though they had as much right of inheri∣tance
to sit there, as any English peer had of sitting in the
parliament of England. He expressed his apprehension
of this precedent; and asked what security any peer of
<PB N="99" REF="105"/>
England had for his right and privilege of peerage, which
those lords had not. He said, if the bishops would weak∣en
their own cause, so far as to give up the two great
points of episcopal ordination and confirmation; if they
would approve and ratify the act for securing the presby∣terian
church-government in Scotland, as the true pro∣testant
religion and purity of worship; they must give up
that which had been contended for between them and the
presbyterians for thirty years, and been defended by the
greatest and most learned men in the church of England.
He objected to the exempting articles, by which heritable
offices and superiorities were reserved. He affirmed that
the union was contrary to the sense of the Scottish nation;
that the murmurs of the people had been so loud as to
fill the whole kingdom; and so bold as to reach even to
the doors of the parliament; that the parliament itself
had suspended their beloved clause in the act of security
for arming the people; that the government had issued
a proclamation, pardoning all slaughter, bloodshed, and
maiming, committed upon those who should be found in
tumults. From these circumstances he concluded, that
the Scottish nation was averse to an incorporating union,
which he looked upon as one of the most dangerous ex∣periments
to both nations. Lord North and Grey com∣plained
of the small and unequal proportion of the land-tax
imposed upon Scotland. The Earl of Nottingham
said it was highly unreasonable that the Scots, who were
by the treaty let into all the branches of the English trade,
and paid so little towards the expense of the government,
should moreover have such a round sum by way of equi∣valent.
The same topicks were insisted upon by the Lords
North and Grey, Guernsey, Granville, Stawell, and
Abingdon. The Earl of Nottingham, after having op∣posed
every article separately, concluded with words to
his effect: “As Sir John Maynard said to the late King
at the Revolution, that having buried all his cotempo∣raries
in Westminster-hall, he was afraid, if his Ma∣jesty
had not come in that very juncture of time, he
<PB N="100" REF="106"/>
might have likewise outlived the very laws; so, if this
union do pass, as I have no reason to doubt but it will,
I may justly affirm I have outlived all the laws, and the
very constitution of England; I, therefore, pray to God
to avert the dire effects which may probably ensue from
such an incorporating union.”</P>
<P>§ XIV. These arguments and objections were answered
by the Lord-Treasurer Godolphin, the Earls of Sunder∣land
and Wharton, the Lords Townshend, Hallifax, and
Somers, the Bishops of Oxford, Norwich, and Sarum.
They observed, that such an important measure could not
be effected without some inconveniencies; but that these
ought to be born, in consideration of the greatness of the
advantage; that the chief dangers to which the church
was exposed arose from France and popery; and this
union would effectually secure it against these evils; that
Scotland lay on the weakest side of England, which could
not be defended but by an expensive army. Should a war
break out between the two nations, and Scotland be con∣quered,
yet even in that case it would be necessary to keep
it under with a standing army, which any enterprising
prince might model for his ambitious purposes, and join∣ing
with the Scots, enslave his English dominions: that
any union after a conquest would be compulsive, conse∣quently
of short duration; whereas, now it was voluntary
it would be lasting: that with regard to ecclesiastical
affairs, all heats and animosities might be allayed by soft
and gentle management. The cantons of Switzerland,
though they professed different religions, were yet united
in one general body; and the diet of Germany was com∣posed
of princes and states, among whom three different
persuasions prevailed; so that two sorts of discipline might
very well subsist under one legislature. If there was any
danger on either side, it threatened the Scots much more
than the English, as five hundred and thirteen members
would certainly be too hard for forty-five; and in the
House of Lords, six-and-twenty bishops would always
preponderate against sixteen peers from Scotland. Not∣withstanding
<PB N="101" REF="107"/>
all the opposition made by the lords of the
Tory interest, every article was approved by a great ma∣jority,
though not without a good number of protesta∣tions;
and a bill of ratification was prepared in the Lower
House by Sir Simon Harcourt, the sollicitor-general, in
such an artful manner as to prevent all debates. All the
articles, as they passed in Scotland, were recited by way
of preamble, together with the acts made in both parlia∣ments
for the security of their several churches;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> and in
conclusion there was one clause,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boyer.</NOTE> by which the whole was
ratified and enacted into a law.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quincy.</NOTE> By this contrivance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Torcy.</NOTE>

remembered and spoke of hereafter, to the honour of those
who had been instrumental in bringing it to such a happy
conclusion. She desired that her subjects of both king∣doms
should from henceforward behave with all possible
respect and kindness towards one another, that so it might
appear to all the world they had hearts disposed to become
one people.</P>
<P>§ XV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1707.</NOTE> As the act of union did not take place till the
first of May, a great number of traders in both kingdoms
resolved to take advantage of this interval. The English
proposed to export into Scotland such commodities as en∣titled
them to a drawback, with a view to bring them back
after the first of May. The Scots, on the other hand,
as their duties were much lower than those in England,
intended to import great quantities of wine, brandy, and
<PB N="102" REF="108"/>
other merchandize,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1707.</NOTE> which they could sell at a greater ad∣vantage
in England after the union, when there would be
a free intercourse between the two nations. Some of the
ministers had embarked in this fraudulent design, which
alarmed the merchants of England to such a degree, that
they presented a remonstrance to the Commons. Resolu∣tions
were immediately taken in the House against these
practices, and a bill was prepared; but the Lords appre∣hending
that it in some measure infringed the articles of
the union, and that it might give umbrage to the Scottish
nation, it was dropped. The frauds had been in a good
measure prevented by the previous resolutions of the House;
and the first day of May was now at hand; so that the
bill was thought unnecessary. On the twenty-fourth day
of April the Queen prorogued the parliament, after having
given them to understand, that she would continue by
proclamation the Lords and Commons already assembled,
as members in the first British Parliament on the part of
England, pursuant to the power vested in her by the acts
of parliament of both kingdoms, ratifying the treaty of
union. The parliament was accordingly revived by pro∣clamation,
and another issued to convoke the first parlia∣ment
of Great-Britain for the twenty-third day of October.
The Scots repaired to London, where they were well re∣ceived
by the Queen, who<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bestowed the title of duke on
the Earls of Roxburgh and Montrose. She likewise
granted a commission for a new privy-council in that
kingdom, to be in force till the next session of parliament,
that the nation might not be disgusted by too sudden an
alternation of outward appearances. The first of May was
appointed as a day of publick thanksgiving; and congra∣tulatory
addresses were sent up from all parts of England;
but the university of Oxford prepared no compliment; and
the Scots were wholly silent on this occasion.</P>
<P>§ XVI. In the course of this session the Commons, in
an address to the Queen, desired she would resettle the
islands of St. Christopher's and Nevis in the West-Indies,
which had been ravaged by the enemy. They likewise
<PB N="103" REF="109"/>
resolved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IX. 1707.</NOTE> That an humble address should be presented to
her Majesty, praying she would concert measures for sup∣pressing
a body of pirates who had made a settlement on
the island of Madagascar, as also for recovering and pre∣serving
the ancient possessions, trade, and fishery in New∣foundland.
The French refugees likewise delivered a re∣monstrance
to the Queen, recapitulating the benefits
which the persecuted protestants in France had reaped
from the assistance of her royal progenitors, acknowledg∣ing
their own happiness in living under her gentle go∣vernment,
among a people by whom they had been so
kindly entertained when driven from their native country;
and imploring her Majesty's interposition and good offices
in favour of their distressed and persecuted brethren abroad.
She graciously received this address, declaring, she had
always great compassion for the unhappy circumstances of
the protestants in France: that she would communicate
her thoughts on this subject to her allies; and she ex∣pressed
her hope that such measures might be taken as
should effectually answer the intent of their petition. In
the month of May she granted an audience to an ambassa∣dor
extraordinary from the Czar of Muscovy, who deli∣vered
a letter from his master, containing complaints of
King Augustus, who had maltreated the Russian troops
sent to his assistance, concluded a dishonourable peace
with Charles King of Sweden, without the knowledge of
his allies, and surrendered Count Patkul, the Muscovite
minister, as a deserter, to the Swedish monarch, contrary
to the law of nations, and even to the practice of barba∣rians.
He, therefore, desired her Britannick Majesty would
use her good offices for the enlargement of the Count, and
the other Russian prisoners detained at Stockholm; and
that she would take into her protection the remains of the
Russian auxiliaries upon the Rhine, that they might either
enter into the service of the allies, or be at liberty to return
in safety to their own country. The Queen actually in∣terposed
in behalf of Patkul: but her intercession proved
ineffectual, and that unhappy minister was put to death
<PB N="104" REF="110"/>
with all the circumstances of wanton barbarity. As many
severe and sarcastick writings had lately appeared, in which
the Whigs and ministry were reviled, and reflexions hinted
to the prejudice of the Queen's person, the government
resolved to make examples of the authors and publishers of
these licentious productions. Dr. Joseph Browne was
twice pillored for a copy of verses, intituled, “The
country parson's advice to the Lord-Keeper,” and a
letter which he afterwards wrote to Mr. Secretary Harley.
William Stephens, rector of Sutton in Surrey, underwent
the same sentence, as author of a pamphlet, called, “A
letter to the author of the memorial of the church of
England.” Edward Ward was sined and set in the pil∣lory,
for having written a burlesque poem on the times,
under the title of “Hudibras redivivus;” and the same
punishment was inflicted upon William Pittes, author of a
performance, intituled, “The case of the church of Eng∣land's
memorial fairly stated.”</P>
<P>§ XVII. The Lower House of Convocation still conti∣nued
to wrangle with their superiors; and though they
joined the Upper House in a congratulatory address to the
Queen on the success of her arms, they resolved to make
application to the Commons against the union. The
Queen being apprised of their design, desired the Arch∣bishop
to prorogue them for three weeks, before the expi∣ration
of which the act of union had passed in parlia∣ment.
The Lower House delivered a representation to
the bishops, in which they affirmed, no such prorogation
had ever been ordered during the session of parliament.
The bishops found in their records seven or eight prece∣dents
of such prorogations, and above thirty instances of
the Convocation's having sat sometimes before, and some∣times
after a session of parliament, nay, sometimes even
when the parliament was dissolved. The Queen, in∣formed
of these proceedings, wrote a letter to the Arch∣bishop,
intimating, that she looked upon the Lower
House as guilty of an invasion of her royal supremacy;
and that, if any thing of the same nature should be at∣tempted
<PB N="105" REF="111"/>
for the future, she would use such means for pu∣nishing
offenders as the law warranted. The Prolocutor
absenting himself from the Convocation, the Archbishop
pronounced sentence of contumacy against him. The
Lower House in a protestation declared this sentence un∣lawful
and altogether null. Nevertheless, the Prolocutor
made a full submission, with which the Archbishop was
satisfied, and the sentence was repealed. About this pe∣riod
the Earl of Sunderland was appointed one of the
secretaries of state, in the room of Sir Charles Hedges.
This change was not effected without great opposition
from Harley, who was in his heart an enemy to the Duke
of Marlborough, and all his adherents; and had already,
by his secret intrigues, made considerable progress in a
scheme for superseding the influence of the Duchess.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. The French King at this juncture seemed to
be entirely abandoned by his former good fortune. He
had sustained such a number of successive defeats as had
drained his kingdom of people; and his treasury was almost
exhausted. He endeavoured to support the credit of his
government by issuing mint-bills, in imitation of the
bank-notes of England: but, notwithstanding all his pre∣cautions,
they passed at a discount of three-and-fifty per∣cent.
The lands lay uncultivated: the manufactures.
could be no longer carried on; and the subjects perished
with famine. The allies, on the other hand, seemed to
prosper in every quarter. They had become masters of
the greatest part of the Netherlands, in consequence of
the victory at Ramillies: the army of King Charles was
considerably re-enforced: a scheme was formed for the
conquest of Toulon, by the troops of the Emperor and
the Duke of Savoy, supplied with a large sum of money
by Queen Anne, and assisted by the combined sleets of
England and Holland, under the command of Sir
Cloudesley Shovel. In a word, France seemed to be re∣duced
to the verge of destruction, from which nothing in
all probability could have saved her but the jealousy and
misconduct of the consederates. Louis, by virtue of his
<PB N="106" REF="112"/>
capitulation with the Emperor in Italy, was enabled to
send such re-enforcements into Spain, as turned the fortune
of the war in that country; while the distractions i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the council of King Charles prevented that unanimity and
concurrence, without which no success can be expected.
The Earl of Peterborough declared against an offensive
war, on account of the difficulty of finding subsistence in
Castile; and advised Charles to trust to the expedition
against Toulon. This opinion he sent from Italy, to which
he had withdrawn.</P>
<P>§ XIX. Charles, however, was persuaded to penetrate
once more to Madrid, and give battle to the enemy
wherever they should appear. On the thirteenth day of
March the army was assembled at Caudela, to the number
of sixteen thousand men, under the auspices of the Mar∣quis
das Minas, to whom the Earl of Galway was second
in command. They marched towards Yecla, and under∣took
the siege of Vilena; but, having received intelli∣gence
that the Duke of Berwick was in the neighbour∣hood,
they advanced on the fourteenth day of April in
four columns towards the town of Almanza, where the
enemy were drawn up in order of battle, their number
being considerably superior to that of the confederates.
The battle began about two in the afternoon, and the
whole front of each army was fully engaged. The English
and Dutch squadrons on the left, sustained by the Portu∣guese
horse of the second line, were overpowered after a
gallant resistance. The centre, consisting chiefly of bat∣talions
from Great-Britain and Holland, obliged the
enemy to give way, and drove their first upon their second
line: but the Portuguese cavalry on the right being
broken at the first charge, their foot betook themselves to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ight; so that the English and Dutch troops being left
naked on the flanks, were surrounded and attacked on
every side. In this dreadful emergency they formed them∣selves
into a square, and retired from the field of battle.
By this time the men were quite spent with fatigue, and
all their ammunition exhausted: they were ignorant of
<PB N="107" REF="113"/>
the country, abandoned by their horse, destitute of provi∣sion,
and cut off from all hope of supply. Moved by
these dismal considerations they capitulated, and surren∣dered
themselves prisoners of war, to the amount of
thirteen battalions. The Portuguese, and part of the
English horse, with the infantry that guarded the baggage,
retreated to Alcira, where they were joined by the Earl of
Galway, with about five-and-twenty hundred dragoons
which he had brought from the field of battle. About
three thousand men of the allied army were killed upon
the spot, and among that number Brigadier Killigrew,
with many officers of distinction. The Earl of Galway,
who charged in person at the head of Guiscard's dragoons,
received two deep cuts in the face. The Marquis das
Minas was run through the arm, and saw his concubine,
who fought in the habit of an Amazon, killed by his side:
the Lords Tyrawley, Mark Kerr, and Colonel Clayton,
were wounded: all their artillery, together with an hun∣dred
and twenty colours and standards, and about ten
thousand men, were taken; so that no victory could be
more complete: yet it was not purchased without the loss
of two thousand men slain in the action, including some
officers of eminence. The Duke of Berwick, who com∣manded
the troops of King Philip, acquired a great addi∣tion
of fame by his conduct and behaviour before and
during the engagement: but his authority was superseded
by the Duke of Orleans, who arrived in the army imme∣diately
after the battle. This prince seemed to entertain
some private views of his own; for he took no effectual
step to improve the victory. He began a private negocia∣tion
with the Earl of Galway, during which the two
armies lay inactive on the banks of the Cinca; and he
concluded the campaign with the siege of Lerida, which
was surrendered by capitulation on the second day of No∣vember:
then the troops on both sides went into winter-quarters.
The Earl of Galway and the Marquis das
Minas embarked at Barcelona for Lisbon, and General
Carpenter remained commander of the English forces
<PB N="108" REF="114"/>
quartered in Catalonia, which was now the only part of
Spain that remained to King Charles.</P>
<P>§ XX. The attempt upon Toulon by the Duke of
Savoy and Prince Eugene might have succeeded, if the
Emperor, notwithstanding the repeated remonstrances of
the maritime powers, had not divided his army in Italy,
by detaching a considerable body through the ecclesiastical
state towards Naples, of which he took possession without
any difficulty. Besides, ten thousand recruits destined
for the Imperial forces in Italy were detained in Ger∣many,
from an apprehension of the King of Sweden,
who remained in Saxony, and seemed to be upon very
indifferent terms with the Emperor. With the assistance
of the English and Dutch fleets the Duke of Savoy and
Prince Eugene passed the Var<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This passage was effected, to the astonishment of the French who thought the works they had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aised on that river were impregnable. The honour of the enterprise was in a great measure owing to the gallantry of Sir John Norris and the English seamen. That brave officer, embarking in boats with six hundred sailors and mariners, entered the river, and were rowed within musket shot of the enemy's works, where they made such a vigorous and unexpected attack, that the French were immediately driven from part of their entrenchments: then Sir John landed with his men, clambered over the works that were deemed inaccessible, and attacking the defendants sword in hand, com<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elled them to fly with the utmost precipita∣tion. This detachment was sustained by Sir Cloudesley Shovel in person. The Duke of Savoy, taking advantage of the enemy's consternation, passed the river almost without opposition.</NOTE> on the eleventh day of
July, at the head of an army of thirty thousand men, and
marched directly towards Toulon, whither the artillery
and ammunition were conveyed on board of the combined
squadrons. The French King was extremely alarmed at
this attempt, as five thousand pieces of cannon, vast maga∣zines,
and the best part of his fleet, were in the harbour
of Toulon, and ran the greatest risque of being entirely
taken or destroyed. The whole kingdom of France was
silled with consternation, when they found their enemies
were in the bosom of their country. The monarch re∣solved
to leave no stone unturned for the relief of the place,
and his subjects exerted themselves in a very extraordinary
<PB N="109" REF="115"/>
manner for its preservation. The nobility of the adjacent
provinces armed their servants and tenants, at the head of
whom they marched into the city; they coined their
plate, and pawned their jewels for money to pay the
workmen employed upon the fortifications; and such in∣dustry
was used, that in a few days the town and harbour,
which had been greatly neglected, were put in a good
posture of defence. The allies took possession of the emi∣nences
that commanded the city, and the ordnance being
landed, erected batteries. From these they began to can∣nonade
and bombard the city, while the fleet attacked and
reduced two sorts at the entrance of the mole; and co∣operated
in the siege with their great guns and bomb∣ketches.
The garrison was numerous, and desended the
place with great vigour. They sunk ships in the entrance
to the mole; they kept up a prodigious fire from the ram∣parts;
they made desperate sallies, and even drove the
besiegers from one of their posts with great slaughter.
The French King, alarmed at this design of his enemies,
ordered troops to march towards Toulon from all parts of
his dominions. He countermanded the forces that were
on their route to improve the victory of Almanza; a great
part of the army under Villars on the Rhine was detached
to Provence, and the court of Versailles declared, that
the Duke of Burgundy should march at the head of a
strong army to the relief of Toulon. The Duke of Savoy
being apprised of these preparations, seeing no hope of
reducing the place, and being apprehensive that his passage
would be intercepted, resolved to abandon his enterprise.
The artillery being re-embarked, with the sick and
wounded, he decamped in the night, under favour of a
terrible bombardment and cannonading from the English
sleet, and retreated to his own country without molesta∣tion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Had the Duke of Savoy marched with expedition from the Var, he would have found Toulon defenceless: but he lingered in such a manner as gives reason to believe he was not hearty in the enterprise; and his opera∣tions were reta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded by a difference between him and his kinsman Prince Eugene.</NOTE>.
Then he undertook the reduction of Suza, the
<PB N="110" REF="116"/>
garrison of which surrendered at discretion. By this con∣quest
he not only secured the key to his own dominions,
but also opened to himself a free passage into Dauphiné.</P>
<P>§ XXI. Sir Cloudesley Shovel having left a squadron
with Sir Thomas Dilkes for the Mediterranean service,
set sail for England with the rest of the fleet, and was in
soundings on the twenty-second day of October. About
eight o'clock at night his own ship, the Association,
struck upon the rocks of Scilly, and perished with every
person on board. This was likewise the fate of the Eagle
and the Romney; the Fire-brand was dashed in pieces on
the rocks; but the captain and four-and-twenty men
saved themselves in the boat; the Phoenix was driven on
shore; the Royal Anne was saved by the presence of mind
and uncommon dexterity of Sir George Byng and his
officers; the St. George, commanded by Lord Dursley,
struck upon the rocks, but a wave set her a-float again.
The admiral's body being cast a-shore was stripped and
buried in the sand; but afterwards discovered and brought
into Plymouth, from whence it was conveyed to the London,
and interred in Westminster-abbey. Sir Cloudesley Shovel
was born of mean parentage in the county of Suffolk; but
raised himself to the chief command at sea, by his industry,
valour, skill, and integrity. On the Upper Rhine the
Allies were unprosperous<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the month of May three ships of the line, namely the Royal Oak, of seventy-six guns, commanded by Commodore Baron Wylde; the Grafton, of seventy-guns, Captain Edward Action; and the Hampton-Court, of seventy guns, Captain George Clements, sailed as convoy to the West-India and Portugal sleet of merchant ships, amounting to five-and-fifty sail. They fell in with the Dunkirl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> squadron, consisting of ten ships of war, one frigate, and four privateers, under the command of M. de Forbin. A furious action immediately ensued, and notwithstanding the vast disproportion in point of number, was maintained by the English Commodore with great gallantry, unti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Captain Action was killed, Captain Clements mortally wounded, and the Grafton and Hampton. Court were taken, after having sunk the Salisbury, at that time in the hands of the French: then the Commodore, having eleven feet water in his hold, disengaged himself from the enemy, by whom he had been surrounded, and ran his ship aground near Dungenesse; but she afterwards floated, and he brought her safe into the Downs. In the mean time the French frigate and privateers made prize of twenty-one English merchant-ships of great value, which, with the Grafton and Hampton-Court, Forbin conveyed in triumph to Dunkirk. In July the same active officer took fifteen ships belonging to the Russia company, off the coast of Lapland. In September he joined another squa∣dron fitted out at Brest, under the command of the celebrated M. de Guai Trooin, and these attacked, off the Lizard, the convoy of the Portugal fleet, consisting of the Cumberland, Captain Richard Edwards, of eighty guns; the Devonshire, of eighty; the Royal Oak, of seventy-six; the Chester and Ruby, of fifty guns each. Though the French squadron did not fall short of twelve sail of the line, the English Captains maintained the action for many hours with surprising valour. At length the Devonshire was obliged to yield to superior numbers▪ the Cumberland blew up; the Chester and Ruhy were taken; the Royal Oak fought her way through the midst of her enemies, and arrived safe in the harbour of Kinsale; and the Lisbon fleet saved themselves, by making the best of their way during the engagement. Since the battle off Malaga the French King had never dared to keep the sea with a largefleet, but carried on a kind of piratical war of this sort, in order to distress the trade of England. He was the more encouraged to pursue these measures, by the correspondence which his ministers carried on with some wretches belonging to the Admiralty, and other offices, who basely betrayed their country in transmitting to France such intelligence concerning the convoys appointed for the protection of commerce, as enabled the enemy to attack them at advantage. In the course of this year the French fishery, stages, ships, and vessels in Newfoundland were taken, burned, and destroyed, by Captain John Underdown, of the Falleland.</NOTE>. The Prince of Baden was
<PB N="111" REF="117"/>
dead, and the German army so inconsiderable, that it
could not defend the lines of Buhl against the Mareschal
de Villars, who broke through this work, esteemed the
rampart of Germany, reduced Rastadt, defeated a body
of horse, laid the duchy of Wirtemberg under contri∣bution,
took Stutgard and Schorndorf; and routed three
thousand Germans entrenched at Lorch, under the com∣mand
of General Janus, who was made prisoner. In all
probability, this active officer would have made great pro∣gress
towards the restoration of the Elector of Bavaria,
had not he been obliged to stop in the middle of his career,
in consequence of his army's being diminished by sending
off detachments to Provence. The Imperial army retired
towards Hailbron, and the command of it was, at the
request of the Emperor and allies, assumed by the Elector
of Hanover, who restored military discipline, and acted
with uncommon prudence and circumspection; but he
<PB N="112" REF="118"/>
had not force sufficient to undertake any enterprise of im<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>portance.</P>
<P>§ XXII. In the month of April the Duke of Marlbo
rough set out from the Hague for Leipsick with a lette
from the Queen to Charles XII. of Sweden, whose design
were still so mysterious, that the confederates could no
help being alarmed at his being in the heart of Germany.
The Duke was pitched upon as the most proper ambassa∣dor,
to soothe his vanity and penetrate into his real in∣tention<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the Duke arrived in his coach at the quarters of Count Piper, of whom he had demanded an audience, he was given to understand that the Count was busy, and obliged to wait half an hour before the Swedish minister came down to receive him. When he appeared at last, the Duke alighted from his coach, put on his hat, passed the Count without saluting him, and went aside to the wall, where having staid some time, he returned and accosted him with the most polite address.</NOTE>. He found this original character, not simple,
but forbid in his appearance and oeconomy, savage in his
deportment, ferocious, illiterate, stubborn, implacable,
and reserved. The English general assailed him on the
side of his vanity, the only part by which he was accessi∣ble.
“Sire (said he) I present to your Majesty a letter,
not from the Chancery, but from the heart of the
Queen my mistress, and written with her own hand.
Had not her sex prevented her from taking so long a
journey, she would have crossed the sea to see a prince
admired by the whole universe. I esteem myself happy
in having the honour of assuring your Majesty of my
regard; and I should think it a great happiness, if my
affairs would allow me to learn under so great a general
as your Majesty, what I want to know in the art of
war.” Charles was pleased with this overstrained
compliment, which seems to have been calculated for a
raw, unintelligent barbarian, unacquainted with the
characters of mankind. He professed particular venera∣tion
for Queen Anne, as well for the person of her
ambassador, and declared he would take no steps to the
prejudice of the grand alliance. Nevertheless, the since∣rity
of this declaration has been questioned. The French
<PB N="113" REF="119"/>
court is said to have gained over his minister, Count Piper,
to their interest. Certain it is, he industriously sought
occasion to quarrel with the Emperor, and treated him
with great insolence, until he submitted to all his de∣mands.
The treaty being concluded upon the terms he
thought proper to impose, he had no longer the least
shadow of pretence to continue his disputes with the court
of Vienna; and therefore began his march for Poland,
which was by this time over-run by the Czar of Muscovy.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. The Duke of Marlborough returning from
Saxony, assembled the allied army at Anderlach near
Brussels, about the middle of May; and, understanding
that the Elector of Bavaria and the Duke de Vendome,
who commanded the French forces, had quitted their
lines, he advanced to Soignes, with a design to engage
them in the plain of Fleurus. But receiving certain in∣telligence,
that the enemy were greatly superior to the
allies in number, by the help of drafts from all their gar∣risons,
he retreated towards Brussels, and took post at
Mildert; while the French advanced to Gemblours.
Both armies lay inactive until the enemy sent off a large
detachment towards Provence. Then the Duke of Marl∣borough
and General D'Auverquerque resolved to attack
them in their fortified camp at Gemblours. But they re∣treated
with such celerity from one post to another, that
the confederates could not come up with them until they
were safely encamped with their right at Pont-a-Tresin,
and their left under the cannon of Lisle, covered with the
river Schelde, and secured by entrenchments. The allies
chose their camp at Helchin, and foraged under the
cannon of Tournay, within a league of the enemy; but
nothing could induce them to hazard an engagement; and
both armies went into winter-quarters in the latter end of
October. The Duke of Marlborough set out for Frankfort,
where he conferred with the Electors of Mentz, Hanover,
and Palatine, about the operations of the next campaign;
then he returned to the Hague, and having concerted the
<PB N="114" REF="120"/>
necessary measures with the deputies of the States-General,
embarked for England in the beginning of November.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. The Queen's private favour was now shifted to
a new object. The Duchess of Marlborough was supplanted
by Mrs. Masham, her own kinswoman, whom she had res∣cued
from indigence and obscurity. This favourite suc∣ceeded
to that ascendancy over the mind of her sovereign
which the Duchess had formerly possessed. She was more
humble, pliable, and obliging than her first patroness,
who had played the tyrant, and thwarted the Queen in
some of her most respected maxims. Her Majesty's pre∣possession
in favour of the Tories and high-church men
was no longer insolently condemned, and violently op∣posed.
The new confidante conformed to all her preju∣dices,
and encouraged all her designs with assent and ap∣probation.
In political intrigues she acted an associate, or
rather auxiliary, to Mr. Secretary Harley, who had insi∣nuated
himself into the Queen's good graces; and deter∣mined
to sap the credit of the Duke of Marlborough and
the Earl of Godolphin. His aim was to unite the Tory
interest, under his own auspices, and expel the Whigs from
the advantages they possessed under the government. His
chief coadjutor in this scheme was Henry St. John, after∣wards
Lord Bolingbroke, a man of warm imagination and
elegant taste, penetrating, eloquent, ambitious, and en∣terprising,
whose talents were rather specious than solid,
and whose principles were loose and fluctuating. He was
at first contented to act in an inferior capacity, subser∣vient
to the designs of the secretary; but, when he under∣stood
the full extent of his own parts and influence, he
was fired with the ambition of eclipsing his principal, and
from the sphere of his minister, raised himself to the cha∣racter
of his rival. These politicians, with the assistance
of Sir Simon Harcourt, a colleague of uncommon ability
and credit, exerted their endeavours to rally and reconcile
the disunited Tories, who were given to understand, that
the Queen could no longer bear the tyranny of the Whigs:
that she had been always a friend in her heart to the
<PB N="115" REF="121"/>
Tory and high-church party; and that she would now
exhibit manifest proofs of her inclination. She accordingly
bestowed the bishopricks of Chester and Exeter upon Sir
William Dawes and Dr. Blackall, who, though otherwise
of unblemished characters, had openly condemned the Re∣volution.</P>
<P>§ XXV. The people in general began to be sick of the
Whig ministry, whom they had formerly caressed. To
them they imputed the burthens under which they groaned;
burthens which they had hitherto been animated to bear
by the pomp of triumph and uninterrupted success. At
present they were discouraged by the battle of Almanza,
the miscarriage of the expedition against Toulon, the loss
of Sir Cloudesley Shovel, and the fate of four ships of the
line, destroyed or taken by a squadron under the command
of Messieurs Forbin and Du Guai Trouin, two of the
most enterprising sea-officers in the French service. No
new advantage had been obtained in the Netherlands:
France, instead of sinking under the weight of the confe∣deracy,
seemed to rise with fresh vigour from every over∣throw;
the English traders had lately sustained repeated
losses for want of proper convoys; the coin of the nation
was visibly diminished; and the publick credit began to
decline. The Tories did not fail to inculcate and exag∣gerate
these causes of discontent, and the ministry were
too remiss in taking proper steps for the satisfaction of the
nation. Instead of soothing by gentle measures, and equal
administration, the Scots, who had expressed such aver∣sion
to the union, they treated them in such a manner, as
served to exasperate the spirits of that people. A stop was
put to their whole commerce for two months before it was
diverted into the new channel. Three months elapsed
before the equivalent was remitted to that kingdom, and
before the equivalent was remitted to that kingdom, and
it was afterwards applied with the most shameful partiality.
Seizures of wines and other merchandise imported from
thence into England were made in all the northern parts,
with an affectation of severity and disdain: so that the
generality of the Scottish nation loudly exclaimed against
<PB N="116" REF="122"/>
the union and the government. The Jacobites were
again in commotion. They held conferences; they main∣tained
a correspondence with the court of St. Germain's;
a great number of the most rigid Whigs entered so far
into their measures, as to think a revolution was abso∣lutely
necessary to retrieve the liberties, independence,
and commerce of their country; the Pretender's birth∣day
was publickly celebrated in many different parts of
the kingdom; and every thing seemed to portend an uni∣versal
revolt. Ireland continued quiet under the admini∣stration
of the Earl of Pembroke, whom the Queen had
appointed lord-lieutenant of that kingdom. A parliament
having met at Dublin in the month of July, presented
addresses of congratulation to her Majesty on the late union
of the two kingdoms. The Commons having inspected
the public accounts, resolved, That the kingdom had
been put to excessive charge, by means of great arrears of
rent returned by the late trustees, as due out of the for∣feited
estates, which returns were false and unjust; and,
That an humble representation should be laid before her
Majesty on this subject. They passed another laudable
resolution in favour of their own manufactures. They
granted the necessary supplies, and having finished several
bills for the royal assent, were prorogued on the twenty-ninth
day of October.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. It was on the twenty-third of the same month
that the first parliament of Great-Britain assembled at
Westminster, when the Queen in her speech to both
Houses palliated the miscarriages in Provence and in Spain;
represented the necessity of making further efforts against
the common enemy; and exhorted them to be upon their
guard against those who endeavoured to sow jealousies in
the common-wealth. The Commons, in their address,
expressed the continuance of their former zeal and devo∣tion
to her Majesty's government; but, in the House of
Lords, the Earl of Wharton expatiated upon the scarcity
of money, the decay of trade, the mismanagement of the
navy. He was seconded by Lord Somers, and the leaders
<PB N="117" REF="123"/>
of the Tory party, who proposed, that, previous to every
measure, they should consider the state of the nation. The
design of Wharton and Somers, was to raise the Earl of
Orford once more to the head of the Admiralty; and the
Tories, who did not perceive their dirft, hoped in the
course of the enquiry to fix the blame of all mismanage∣ment
upon the Whig ministers. A day being fixed for
this examination, the House received a petition from the
sheriffs and merchants of London, complaining of great
losses by sea, for want of cruisers and convoys; and these
complaints were proved by witnesses. The report was
sent to the Lord-Admiral, who answered all the articles
separately; then the Tories moved for an address, in
which the blame of the miscarriages might be laid upon
the ministry and cabinet-council; but the motion was
over-ruled; the Queen was presented with a bare repre∣sentation
of the facts, and desired that she would take the
proper measures for preventing such evils for the future.
The Commons made some progress in an enquiry of the
same nature; and brought in a bill for the better securing
the trade of the kingdom. They chearfully granted the
supplies for the service of the ensuing year. They pre∣pared
another bill for repealing the Scottish act of security,
and that about peace and war, which had excited such
jealousy in the English nation. They resolved, That
there should be but one privy-council in the kingdom of
Great-Britain: That the militia of Scotland should be
put on the same footing with that of England: That the
powers of the justices of the peace should be the same
through the whole island: That the lords of justiciary
in Scotland should go circuits twice in the year: That
the writs for electing Scottish members to serve in the
House of Commons should be directed, and returns made,
in the same manner as practised in England. An act
being formed on these resolutions, they brought in a bill
for preserving the trade with Portugal: then they consi∣dered
the state of the war in Spain.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="124"/>
§ XXVII. When the Queen passed these bills, she re∣commended
an augmentation in the aids and auxiliaries
granted to the King of Spain and the Duke of Savoy.
This intimation produced a debate in the House of Lords,
on the affairs of Spain. The services of the Earl of Pe∣terborough
were extolled by the Earls of Rochester and
Lord Haversham, who levelled some oblique reflexions at
the Earl of Galway. Several lords enlarged upon the
necessity of carrying on the war until King Charles
should be fully established upon the throne of Spain. The
Earl of Peterborough said they ought to contribute nine
shillings in the pound rather than make peace on any
other terms: he declared himself ready to return to Spain,
and serve even under the Earl of Galway. The Earl of
Rochester repeated a maxim of the old Duke of Schom∣berg,
That attacking France in the Netherlands was
like taking a bull by the horns. He, therefore, proposed,
that the allies should stand on the defensive in Flanders,
and detach from thence fifteen or twenty thousand men
into Catalonia. He was seconded by the Earl of Not∣tingham;
but warmly opposed by the Duke of Marlbo∣rough,
who urged, that the great towns in Brabant which
he had conquered could not be preserved without a consi∣derable
number of men; and that if the French should
gain any advantage in Flanders from their superiority in
point of number, the discontented party in Holland,
which was very numerous, and bore with impatience the
burthen of the war, would not fail crying aloud for peace.
Being challenged by Rochester to show how troops could
be procured for the service of Italy and Spain, he assured
the House, that measures had been already concerted with
the Emperor, for forming an army of forty thousand men
under the Duke of Savoy, and for sending powerful suc∣cours
to King Charles. This declaration finished the
debate, which issued in an affectionate address to her Ma∣jesty.
The Lords resolved, That no peace could be safe
and honourable for her Majesty and her allies, if Spain
and the Spanish West-Indies were suffered to continue in
<PB N="119" REF="125"/>
the power of the House of Bourbon. They presented an
address, in which they desired she would press the Em∣peror
to send powerful succours to Spain, under the com∣mand
of Prince Eugene, with all possible expedition, to
make good his contract with the Duke of Savoy, and
strengthen the army on the Rhine, which was now hap∣pily
put under the conduct of that wise and valiant prince,
the Elector of Hanover. The Commons concurred in this
remonstrance, in consequence of which the Queen desired
the Emperor to bestow the command in Spain upon
Prince Eugene. The court of Vienna, however, did
not comply with this request; but sent thither Count
Staremberg, who, of all the German generals, was next
to the Prince in military reputation. The Commons now
proceeded to consider of ways and means, and actually
established funds for raising the supply, which amounted to
the enormous sum of six millions.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. At this period Mr. Harley's character in∣curred
suspicion from the treachery of William Gregg,
an inferior clerk in his office, who was detected in a cor∣respondence
with Monsieur Chamillard, the French King's
minister. When his practices were detected, he made an
ample confession, and pleading guilty to his indictment at
the Old-Bailey, was condemned to death for high-treason.
At the same time, John Bara and Alexander Valiere
were committed to Newgate, for corresponding with the
enemy; and Claude Baud, secretary to the Duke of Savoy's
minister, was, at the request of his master, apprehended
for traiterous practices against her Majesty and her govern∣ment.
A committee of seven lords being appointed to
examine these delinquents, made a report to the House,
which was communicated to the Queen, in an address,
importing, that Gregg had discovered secrets of state to
the French minister: that Alexander Valiere and John
Bara had managed a correspondence with the governours
and commissaries of Calais and Boulogn; and, in all
probability, discovered to the enemy the stations of the
British cruisers, the strength of their convoys, and the
<PB N="120" REF="126"/>
times at which the merchant-ships proceeded on their
voyages: that all the papers in the office of Mr. Secre∣tary
Harley had been for a considerable time exposed to
the view of the meanest clerks; and that the perusal of all
the letters to and from the French prisoners had been
chiefly trusted to Gregg, a person of a very suspicious cha∣racter,
and known to be extremely indigent. The Queen
granted a reprieve to this man, in hope of his making
some important discovery: but he really knew nothing of
consequence to the nation. He was an indigent Scot,
who had been employed as a spy in his own country, and
now offered his services to Chamillard, with a view of
being rewarded for his treachery: but he was discovered
before he had reaped any fruits from his correspondence.
As he had no secrets of importance to impart, he was
executed at Tyburn, where he delivered a paper to the
sheriff, in which he declared Mr. Harley entirely ignorant
of all his treasonable connexions, notwithstanding some
endeavours that were made to engage him in an accusation
of that minister.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. The Queen had refused to admit the Earl of
Peterborough into her presence, until he should have vindi∣cated
his conduct, of which King Charles had complained
in divers letters. He was eagerly desirous of a parlia∣mentary
enquiry. His military proceedings, his negocia∣tions,
his disposal of the remittances were taken into con∣sideration
by both Houses: but he produced such a num∣ber
of witnesses and original papers to justify every trans∣action,
that his character triumphed in the enquiry, which
was dropped before it produced any resolution in parlia∣ment.
Then they took cognizance of the state of affairs
in Spain, and found there had been a great deficiency in
the English troops at the battle of Almanza. This, how∣ever,
was explained so much to their satisfaction, that they
voted an address to the Queen, thanking her for having
taken measures to restore the affairs in Spain, and provide
foreign troops for that service. The bill for rendering the
union more complete met with a vigorous opposition in
<PB N="121" REF="127"/>
the House of Lords from the court-party, on account of
the clause enacting, That, after the first of May, there
should be but one privy-council in the kingdom of Great∣Britain.
The ministry finding it was strenuously support∣ed
by all the Tories, and a considerable number of the
other faction, would have compromised the difference, by
proposing that the privy-council of Scotland should con∣tinue
to the first day of October. They hinted this ex∣pedient,
in hope of being able to influence the ensuing elec∣tions:
but their design being palpable, the motion was
over-ruled, and the bill received the royal assent: a court
of Exchequer, however, was erected in Scotland upon the
model of that in England. The execution of Gregg,
and the examination of Valiere and Bara, who had acted
as smugglers to the coast of France, under the protection
of Harley, to whom they engaged for intelligence, affected
the credit of that minister, who was reviled and traduced
by the emissaries of the Whig party. The Duke of Marl∣borough
and the Earl Godolphin, being apprised of his
secret practices with Mrs. Masham, wrote to the Queen,
that they could serve her no longer, should Mr. Harley
continue in the post of secretary. Being summoned to the
cabinet-council, they waited on her in person, and ex∣postulated
on the same subject. She endeavoured to ap∣pease
their resentment with soft persuasion, which had no
effect; and when they retired from court, to the astonish∣ment
of all the spectators, she repaired in person to the
council. There Mr. Secretary Harley began to explain
the cause of their meeting, which was some circumstance
relating to foreign affairs. The Duke of Somerset said
he did not see how they could deliberate on such matters
while the general and treasurer were absent: the other
members observed a sullen silence; so that the coun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il
broke up, and the Queen found herself in danger of
being abandoned by her ministers. Next day her Ma∣jesty
sent for the Duke of Marlborough, and told him that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arley should immediately resign his office, which was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onserred upon Mr. Henry Boyle, chancellor of the Ex∣chequer:
<PB N="122" REF="128"/>
but she deeply resented the deportment of the
Duke and the Earl of Godolphin, from whom she en∣tirely
withdrew her confidence. Sir Simon Harcourt, at∣torney-general,
Sir Thomas Mansel, comptroller of the
household, and Mr. St. John, relinquished their several
posts upon the disgrace of Harley.</P>
<P>§ XXX. The kingdom was at this period alarmed with a
threatened invasion from France. The Court of St. Ger∣main's
had sent over one Colonel Hook with credentials to
Scotland, to learn the situation, number, and ability of the
Pretender's friends in that country. This minister, by his
misconduct, produced a division among the Scottish Jaco∣bites.
Being a creature of the Duke of Perth, he attached
himself wholly to the Duke of Athol, and those other
zealous partisans who were bent upon receiving the Pre∣tender
without conditions; and he neglected the Duke of
Hamilton, the Earl Marischal, and other adherents of that
house, who adopted the more moderate principles avowed by
the Earl of Middleton. At his return to France, he made
such a favourable report of the disposition and power of the
Scottish nation, that Louis resolved to equip an armament,
and send over the Pretender to that kingdom. His pretence
was to establish that prince on the throne of his ancestors:
but his real aim was to make a division from the Nether∣lands,
and excite a revolt in Great-Britain, which should
hinder Queen Anne from exerting herself against France
on the continent. He began to make preparations for this
expedition at Dunkirk, where a squadron was assembled
under the command of the Chevalier de Fourbin; and a
body of land-forces were embarked with Monsieur de Gace,
afterwards known by the appellation of the Mareschal de
Matignon. The Pretender, who had assumed the name of
the Chevalier de St. George, was furnished with services
of gold and silver plate, sumptuous tents, rich clothes for
his life-guards, splendid liveries, and all sorts of neces∣saries
even to profusion. Louis at parting presented him
with a sword studded with valuable diamonds, and re∣peated
what he had formerly said to this adventurer's father;
<PB N="123" REF="129"/>
“He hoped he should never see him again.” The Pope
contributed to the expense of this expedition, and accom∣modated
him with divers religious inscriptions, which
were wrought upon his colours and standards. Queen
Anne being informed of these preparations, and the design
of the French monarch, communicated to the Commons
the advices which she had received from Holland and the
Netherlands, touching the destination of the Dunkirk
armament: both Houses concurred in an address, assuring
her they would assist her Majesty with their lives and for∣tunes
against the pretended Prince of Wales, and all her
other enemies. Then they passed a bill, enacting, That
the oath of abjuration should be tendered to all persons, and
such as refused to take it should be in the condition of
convicted recusants. By another, they suspended the Ha∣beas
Corpus act till October, with relation to persons ap∣prehended
by the government on suspicion of treasonable
practices. The Pretender and his adherents were pro∣claimed
traitors and rebels; and a bill was passed, discharg∣ing
the clans of Scotland from all vassalage to those chiefs
who should take up arms against her Majesty. Transports
were hired to bring over ten British battalions from Ostend:
a large fleet being equipped with incredible diligence,
sailed from Deal towards Dunkirk, under the conduct of
Sir John Leake, Sir George Byng, and Lord Dursley.
The French imagined that Leake had sailed to Lisbon,
and that Britain was unprovided of ships of war; so that
they were amazed and confounded when this fleet appeared
off Mardyke: a stop was immediately put to the embark∣ation
of their troops: frequent expresses were dispatched
to Paris: The Count de Fourbin represented to the French
King the little probability of succeeding in this enterprise,
and the danger that would attend the attempt: but he re∣ceived
positive orders to embark the forces, and set sail with
the first favourable wind.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. The British fleet being forced from their
station by severe weather on the fourteenth day of March,
the French squadron sailed on the seventeenth from the
<PB N="124" REF="130"/>
road of Dunkirk: but the wind shifting, it anchored in
Newport-pits, till the nineteenth in the evening, when
they set sail again with a fair breeze, steering their course
for Scotland. Sir George Byng having received advice
of their departure, from an Ostend vessel sent out for that
purpose by Major-General Cadogan, gave chase to the
enemy, after having detached a squadron under Admiral
Baker, to convoy the troops that were embarked at Ostend
for England. On the tenth day of March, the Queen
went to the House of Peers, where, in a speech to both
Houses, she told them that the French fleet had sailed;
that Sir George Byng was in pursuit of them; and that
ten battalions of her troops were expected every day in
England. This intimation was followed by two very
warm addresses from the Lords and Commons, in which
they repeated their assurances of standing by her against all
her enemies. They exhorted her to persevere in support∣ing
the common cause, notwithstanding this petty attempt
to disturb her dominions; and levelled some severe insinu∣ations
against those who endeavoured to foment jealousies
between her Majesty and her most faithful servants. Ad∣dresses
on the same occasion were sent up from different
parts of the kingdom; so that the Queen seemed to look
with contempt upon the designs of the enemy. Several
regiments of foot, with some squadrons of cavalry, began
their march for Scotland: the Earl of Leven, commander
in chief of the forces in that country, and governor of the
castle of Edinburgh, hastened thither to put that fortress
in a posture of defence, and to make the proper dispositions
to oppose the Pretender at his landing. But the vigilance
of Sir George Byng rendered all these precautions unne∣cessary.
He sailed directly to the frith of Edinburgh,
where he arrived almost as soon as the enemy, who im∣mediately
took the advantage of a land breeze, and bore
away with all the sail they could carry. The English
Admiral gave chase; and the Salisbury, one of their ships,
was boarded and taken. At night Monsieur de Fourbin
altered his course; so that next day they were out of reach
<PB N="125" REF="131"/>
of the English squadron. The Pretender desired they
would proceed to the northward, and land him at Inver∣ness,
and Fourbin seemed willing to gratify his request;
but the wind changing, and blowing in their teeth with
great violence, he represented the danger of attempting to
prosecute the voyage; and, with the consent of the Cheva∣lier
de St. George and his general, returned to Dunkirk,
after having been tossed about a whole month in very tem∣pestuous
weather. In the mean time, Sir George Byng
sailed up to Leith road, where he received the freedom of
the city of Edinburgh in a golden box, as a testimony of
gratitude for his having delivered them from the dreadful
apprehensions under which they laboured.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. Certain it is, the Pretender could not have
chosen a more favourable opportunity for making a descent
upon Scotland. The people in general were disaffected to
the government on account of the union; the regular
troops under Leven did not exceed five-and-twenty hun∣dred
men, and even great part of these would in all proba∣bility
have joined the invader: the castle of Edinburgh
was destitute of ammunition, and would in all appearance
have surrendered at the first summons; in which case the
Jacobites must have been masters of the equivalent money
lodged in that fortress: a good number of Dutch ships
loaded with cannon, small arms, ammunition, and a large
sum of money, had been driven on shore in the shire of
Angus, where they would have been seised by the friends
of the Pretender, had the French troops been landed; and all
the adherents of that house were ready to appear in arms.
In England, such a demand was made upon the Bank, by
those who favoured the invasion, and those who dreaded
a revolution, that the publick credit seemed to be in danger.
The Commons resolved, That whoever designedly endea∣voured
to lessen or destroy the publick credit, especially at a
time when the kingdom was threatened with an invasion,
was guilty of a high crime and misdemeanor, and an enemy
to her Majesty and the kingdom. The Lord-Treasurer sig∣nified
to the directors of the Bank, that her Majesty would
<PB N="126" REF="132"/>
allow, for six months, an interest of six per cent. upon their
bills, which was double the usual rate; and consider∣able
sums of money were offered to them by this noble∣man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE>

and Somerset.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hare.</NOTE> The French,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boyer.</NOTE> Dutch, and Jewish mer∣chants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lockbart.</NOTE>

The French refugees, scandalised at their behaviour, and authorised by the Bishop of London, as superior of the French congregations, resolved to enquire into the mission of these pretended prophets, whose names were Elias Marion, John Cavallier, and Durand Fage. They were declared impostors and counterfeits. Notwith∣standing this decision, which was confirmed by the bishops, they continued their assemblies in Soho, under the countenance of Sir Richard Bulkeley and John Lacy. They reviled the ministers of the established church; they de∣nounced judgments against the city of London, and the whole British nation; and published their predictions, composed of unintelligible jargon. Then they were prosecuted at the expence of the French churches, as disturbers of the publick peace, and false prophets. They were sentenced to pay a fine of twenty marks each, and stand twice on a scaffold, with papers on their breasts denoting their offence; a sentence which was executed accordingly at Charing-Cross, and the Royal-Exchange.</P>
<P>In the course of this year, Mr. Stanhope, who was resident from the Queen at the court of Charles, concluded a treaty of commerce with this monarch, which would have proved extremely advantageous to Great-Britain, had he been firmly established on the throne of Spain. It was stipulated that the English merchants should enjoy the privilege of importing all kinds of merchandise from the coast of Barbary into the maritime places of Spain, without paying any higher duty than if that merchandise had been the pro∣duce of Great-Britain; and that even these duties should not be paid till six months after the merchandise should be landed and sold, the merchants giving security for the customs. It was agreed that the whole commerce of the Spa∣nish West-Indies should be carried on by a joint company of Spanish and Bri∣tish merchants; and in the interim, as the greater part of that country was in the hands of Philip, his competitor consented that the British subjects should trade freely in all the ports of the West Indies with ten ships of five hundred tons each, under such convoy as her Britannick Majesty should think fit to appoint.</P></NOTE>.</P>

§ XXXIII. On the first day of April,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IX. 1708.</NOTE> the parliament
was prorogued, and afterwards dissolved by proclamation.
Writs were issued out for new elections, together with a
proclamation, commanding all the peers of North-Bri∣tain
to assemble at Holyrood-house in Edinburgh, on the
seventeenth day of June, to elect sixteen peers to represent
them in the ensuing British parliament, pursuant to the
twenty-second article of the treaty of union. After the
dissolution of parliament, the Lords Grifffin, Clermont, two
sons of the Earle of Middleton, and several Scottish and
Irish officers, who had been taken on board the Salisbury,
were brought to London, and imprisoned in the Tower or
in Newgate. Lord Griffin being attainted by outlawry, for
high-treason committed in the reign of King William,
was brought to the bar in the court of King's-Bench, and
a rule made for his execution; but he was reprieved from
month to month, until he died of a natural death in pri∣son.
The privy-council of Scotland was dissolved; the
Duke of Queensberry was created a British peer, by the
title of Baron of Rippon, Marquis of Beverly, and Duke
of Dover; and the office of secretary at war, vacant by
the resignation of Henry St. John, was bestowed upon Ro∣bert
Walpole, a gentleman who had rendered himself con∣siderable
in the House of Commons, and whose conduct
we shall have occasion to mention more at large in the se∣quel.
About the same time a proclamation was issued for
distributing prizes, in certain proportions, to the different
officers and seamen of the royal navy; a regulation that
still prevails.</P>

§ XXXIV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK 1. 1708.</NOTE> The French King, not at all discouraged
by the miscarriage of his projected invasion, resolved to
improve the advantages he had gained on the continent
during the last campaign; and indeed he made efforts that
were altogether incredible, considering the consumptive
state of his finances.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Before the opening of the campaign, a very daring enterprise was formed by one Colonel Queintern, a partisan in the Imperial army. This man laid a scheme for carrying off the Dauphin of France from the court of Versailles. He selected thirty men of approved valour for this undertaking. He procured passes for them, and they rendezvoused in the neighbourhood of Paris. On the twenty-fourth day of March, in the evening, he and his accomplices stop∣ped a coach and six, with the King's liveries, and arrested the person who was in it, on the supposition of his being a prince of the blood. It was, how∣ever, M. de Berringhen, the King's first equerry. This officer they mounted on a spare horse, and set out for the Low Countries: but, being little ac∣quainted with the roads, they did not reach Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tilly till next morning, when they heard the Toxen, or alarm bell, and thence concluded that de∣tachments were sent out in pursuit of them. Nevertheless, they proceeded boldly, and would certainly have carried the point, had not Queintern halted three hours for the refreshment of his prisoner, who complained of being in∣disposed. He likewise procured a chaise, and ordered the back of it to be low∣ered for his convenience. These acts of humanity retarded him so much, that he was overtaken by a detachment of horse at Ham, within three hours ride of a place of safety. Finding himself surrounded, he thought proper to sur∣render, and M. de Berringhen treated him with great generosity, for the civi∣lities he had received at his hands. He carried him back to Versailles, and lodged him in his own apartments. Madame de Berringhen made him a con∣siderable present: and the King ordered him and his companions to be dis∣charged, on account of the courage and humanity they had displayed.</NOTE>. He assembled a prodigious army
in the Netherlands, under the command of the Duke of
Burgundy, assisted by Vendome, and accompanied by the
Duke of Berry and the Chevalier de St. George. The
Elector of Bavaria was destined to the command of the
troops upon the Rhine, where he was seconded by the
Duke of Berwick; and the Mareschal de Villeroy was
sent to conduct the forces in Dauphiné. About the latter
end of March, the Duke of Marlborough repaired to the
Hague, where he was met by Prince Eugene; these two
celebrated generals conferred with the Pensionary Hein∣sius,
and the deputies of the States-General. Then they
made an excursion to Hanover, where they prevailed upon
<PB N="129" REF="135"/>
the Elector to be satisfied with acting upon the defensive
in his command on the Rhine, and spare part of his
forces, that the confederates might be enabled to make
vigorous efforts in the Netherlands. The Prince pro∣ceeded
to Vienna, and the Duke immediately returned
to Flanders, where he assembled the army towards the
latter end of May. On the twenty-fifth day of that
month, the Duke de Vendome marched to Soignies, and
posted himself within three leagues of the confederates,
who were encamped at Billinghen and Halle. The Duke
of Marlborough having received intelligence that the ene∣my
were on their march by Bois-Seigneur-Isaac to Braine-la-Leuwe,
concluded their intention was to take post on
the banks of the Deule, to hinder the allies from passing
that river, and to occupy Louvaine. He, therefore, com∣manded
the army to march all night, and on the third
day of June encamped at Terbank, General D'Auver∣querque
fixing his quarters in the suburbs of Louvaine,
while the French advanced no farther than Genap and
Braine-la-Leuwe. As they were more numerous than the
consederates, and headed by a prince of the blood, the
generals of the allies at first expected that they would hazard
a battle: but their scheme was to retrieve by stratagem the
places they had lost in Flanders. The Elector of Bavaria
had rendered himself extremely popular in the great towns:
the Count de Bergeyck, who had considerable interest
among them, was devoted to the House of Bour∣bon:
the inhabitants of the great cities were naturally
inconstant and mutinous, and particularly dissatisfied with
the Dutch government. The French generals resolved to
profit by these circumstances. A detachment of their
troops, under the Brigadeers la Faille and Past<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur, sur∣prised
the city of Ghent, in which there was no garrison:
at the same time, the Count de la Motte, with a strong
body of forces, appeared before Bruges, which was sur∣rendered
to him without opposition: then he made a fruit∣less
attempt upon Damme, and marched to the little fort
of Plassendhal, which he took by assault. The Duke of
<PB N="130" REF="136"/>
Marlborough was no sooner apprised of the enemy's having
sent a strong detachment towards Tubize, than he march∣ed
from Terbank, passed the canal, and encamped at An∣derlech.
The French crossed the Senne at Halle and
Tubize, and the allies resolved to attack them next morn∣ing:
but the enemy passed the Dender in the night with
great expedition; and the Duke of Marlborough next day
encamped at Asche, where he was joined by Prince Eu∣gene,
who had marched with a considerable re-enforcement
of Germans from the Moselle. The enemy understanding
that this general was on his march, determined to reduce
Oudenarde, the only pass on the Schelde possessed by the
confederates; and invested it on the ninth day of July,
hoping to subdue it before the allies could be re-enforced.
The Duke of Marlborough was immediately in motion,
and made a surprising march from Asche, as far as Herse∣lingen,
where he was joined by the re-enforcement. Then
he took possession of the strong camp at Lessines, which
the French had intended to occupy, in order to cover the
siege of Oudenarde.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. Thus disappointed, the French generals
altered their resolution, abandoned Oudenarde, and began
to pass the Schelde at Gavre. The two generals of the
confederates were bent upon bringing them to an engage∣ment.
Cadogan was sent with sixteen battalions and eight
squadrons to repair the roads, and throw bridges over the
Schelde below Oudenarde. The army was in motion at
eight o'clock, and marched with such expedition, that
by two in the afternoon the horse had reached the bridges
over which Cadogan and his detachment were passing.
The enemy had posted seven battalions in the village of
Heynem, situated on the banks of the Schelde, and the
French household-troops were drawn up in order of battle
on the adjacent plain, opposite to a body of troops under
Major-General Rantzaw, who were posted behind a
rivulet that ran into the river. The Duke de Vendome
intended to attack the confederates when one half of their
army should have passed the Schelde: but he was thwarted
<PB N="131" REF="137"/>
by the Duke of Burgundy, who seemed to be perplexed
and irresolute. This prince had ordered the troop to
halt in their march to Gavre, as if he had not yet formed
any resolution; and now he recalled the squadrons from
the plain, determined to avoid a battle. Vendome re∣monstrated
against this conduct, and the dispute continued
till three in the afternoon, when the greater part of the
allied army had passed the Schelde without opposition.
Then the Duke of Burgundy declared for an engagement,
and Vendome submitted to his opinion with great re∣luctance,
as the opportunity was now lost, and the army
unformed. Major-General Grimaldi was ordered to at∣tack
Rantzaw with the horse of the King's household,
who, finding the rivulet marshy, refused to charge, and
retired to the right. Mean while Cadogan attacked the
village of Heynem, which he took, with three of the
seven battalions by which it was guarded. Rantzaw
passing the rivulet, advanced into the plain, and drove
before him several squadrons of the enemy. In this attack
the electoral Prince of Hanover, his late Majesty, Geo. II.
charged at the head of Bulau's dragoons with great intre∣pidity.
His horse was shot under him, and Colonel
Laschky killed by his side. Divers French regiments
were entirely broken, and a good number of officers and
standards fell into the hands of the Hanoverians. The
confederates continued still passing the river: but few or
none of the infantry were come up till five in the after∣noon,
when the Duke of Argyle arrived with twenty
battalions, which immediately sustained a vigorous assault
from the enemy. By this time the French were drawn
up in order of battle; and the allies being formed as they
passed the river, both armies were engaged through the
whole extent of their lines about seven in the evening.
Europe had not for many years produced two such noble
armies: above one hundred general officers appeared in
the field, and two hundred and fifty colonels fought at
the head of their respective regiments. The number of
the French exceeded that of the allies by twelve thousand:
<PB N="132" REF="138"/>
but their generals were divided; their forces ill-disposed;
and the men dispirited by the uninterrupted success of
their adversaries. They seemed from the beginning averse
to an engagement, and acted in hurry and trepidation.
Nevertheless, the action was maintained until General
D'Auverquerque and Count Tilly, who commanded on
the left of the allies, obliged the right of the enemy to
give ground; and the Prince of Orange, with Count
Oxienstern, attacked them in flank with the Dutch in∣fantry.
Then they began to give way, and retired in
great confusion. The Duke de Vendome alighting from
his horse, rallied the broken battalions, called the officers
by name, conjured them to maintain the honour of their
country, and animated the men with his voice and exam∣ple.
But, notwithstanding all his endeavours, they were
forced back among the enclosures in great confusion.
Some regiments were cut in pieces: others desired to capi∣tulate;
and, if the darkness had not interposed, their
whole army would have been ruined. The night coming
on, so that it became impossible to distinguish friends
from enemies, the two generals ordered the troops to
cease firing, and the enemy took this opportunity of escap∣ing,
by the road which leads from Oudenarde to Ghent.
The Duke de Vendome seeing the French forces flying in
the utmost terror and precipitation, formed a rear-guard
of about five-and-twenty squadrons, and as many batta∣lions,
with which he secured the retreat. To this pre∣caution
the safety of their army was entirely owing; for
at day-break the Duke of Marlborough sent a large de∣tachment
of horse and foot, under the Lieutenant-Generals
Bulau and Lumley, to pursue the fugitives: but the
hedges and ditches that skirted the road were lined with
the French grenadiers in such a manner, that the cavalry
could not form, and they were obliged to desist. The
French reached Ghent about eight in the morning, and
marching through the city, encamped at Lovendegen on
the canal. There they thought proper to cast up en∣trenchments,
upon which they planted their artillery,
<PB N="133" REF="139"/>
which they had left at Gavre with their heavy baggage.
About three thousand were slain on the field of battle: two
thousand deserted; and about seven thousand were taken,
including a great number of officers, together with ten pieces
of cannon, above an hundred standards and colours, and four
thousand horses. The loss of the allies did not amount to
two thousand men; nor was one officer of distinction killed
on their side during the whole engagement<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among the officers who were engaged in this battle, old General D'Auverquerque and the Duke of Argyle distinguished themselves by the most extraordinary valour and activity.</NOTE>. After the
confederates had rested two days on the field of battle, a
detachment was ordered to level the French lines between
Ypres and the Lys: another was sent to raise contribu∣tions
as far as Arras: they ravaged the country, and
struck terrour even into the city of Paris. While the
allies plundered the province of Picardy, a detachment
from the French army, under the Chevalier de Rozen,
made an irruption into Dutch-Flanders; broke through
the lines of Bervliet, which had been left unguarded, and
made a descent upon the island of Cadsandt, which they
laid under contribution.</P>
<P>§ XXXVI. The generals of the allies now undertook
an enterprise, which, in the opinion of the French generals,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avoured of rashness and inconsiderate self-sufficiency.
This was the siege of Lisle, the strongest town in Flanders,
provided with all necessaries, store of ammunition, and a
garrison re-enforced with one-and-twenty battalions of
the best troops in France, commanded by Mareschal de
Bousslers in person. But these were not the principal
difficulties which the allies encountered. The enemy had
cut off the communication between them and their maga∣zines
at Antwerp and Sas-Van-Ghent; so that they were
obliged to bring their convoys from Ostend along a narrow
causeway, exposed to the attack of an army more nume∣rous
than that with which they sat down before Lisle. On
the thirteenth of August it was invested on one side by
<PB N="134" REF="140"/>
Prince Eugene, and on the other by the Prince of Orange-Nassau,
Stadtholder of Friesland; while the Duke of
Marlborough encamped at Helchin, to cover the siege.
The trenches were opened on the twenty-second day of
August, and carried on with that vigour and alacrity
which is always inspired by victory and success. The
Dukes of Burgundy and Vendome being now joined by
the Duke of Berwick resolved, if possible, to relieve the
place; and made several marches and counter-marches
for this purpose. Marlborough, being apprised of their
intention, marched out of his lines to give them battle,
being re-enforced by a considerable body of troops from
the siege, including Augustus King of Poland, and the
Landgrave of Hesse, as volunteers; but the enemy declined
and engagement, and the allies returned to their camp,
which they fortified with an entrenchment. On the
seventh day of September, the besiegers took by assault
the counterscarp of Lisle, after an obstinate action, in
which they lost a thousand men. The French generals
continued to hover about the camp of the confederates,
which they actually cannonaded; and the Duke of Marl∣borough
again formed his army in order of battle; but
their design was only to harrass the allies with continual
alarms, and interrupt the operations of the siege. They
endeavoured to surprise the town of Aeth, by means of a
secret correspondence with the inhabitants: but the con∣spiracy
was discovered before it took effect. Then they
cut off all communication between the besiegers and the
Schelde, the banks of which they fortified with strong
entrenchments, and a prodigious number of cannon; so
that now all the stores and necessaries were sent to the
camp of the confederates from Ostend. On the twenty-first
day of September, Prince Eugene, who was in the
trenches, seeing the troops driven by the enemy from a
lodgement they had made on the counterscarp of the Te∣naille,
rallied and led them back to the charge; but being
wounded over the left eye with a musket-shot, he was
<PB N="135" REF="141"/>
obliged to retire, and for some days the Duke of Marlbo∣rough
sustained the whole command, both in the siege,
and of the covering army. On the twenty-third the
Tenaille was stormed, and a lodgement made along the
covered-way. Mareschal Boufflers having found means
to inform the Duke de Vendome that his ammunition was
almost expended, this general detached the Chevalier de
Luxemburg, with a body of horse and dragoons, to supply
the place with gunpowder, every man carrying a bag of
forty pounds upon the crupper. They were discovered in
passing through the camp of the allies, and pursued to the
barrier of the town, into which about three hundred were
admitted; but a great number were killed by the confede∣rates,
or miserably destroyed by the explosion of the powder
which they carried.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. The next attempt of the French generals
was to intercept a convoy from Ostend. The Count de
la Motte marched from Ghent, with about two-and-twenty
thousand men, to attack this convoy, which was
guarded by six thousand of the allies, commanded by Ma∣jor-General
Webb. This officer made such an admirable
disposition by the wood of Wynendale, and received the
enemy with such a close sire, that, after a very warm
action, that lasted two hours, they retired in the utmost
confusion, notwithstanding their great superiority in
number, leaving six thousand men killed upon the field of
battle; the loss of the allies not exceeding nine hundred
and twelve officers and soldiers. This was the most ho∣nourable
exploit performed during the whole war, and
of such consequence to the confederates, that if the convoy
had been taken, the siege must have been raised. The
Duke de Vendome ordered the dykes between Bruges and
Newport to be cut, so as to lay the whole country under
water, in hopes of destroying the communication between
Ostend and the camp of the confederates; and, after a
regular siege, he took Colonel Caulsield and a body of
British troops posted in the village of Lessinghen, by
whose means the convoys had been forwarded to the Duke
<PB N="136" REF="142"/>
of Marlborough. On the twenty-second of October,
mareschal Boufflers desired to capitulate for the town of
Lisle; next day the articles were signed; on the twenty-fifth
the allies took possession of the place, and the Ma∣reschal
retired into the citadel with the remains of his
garrison, which, from twelve thousand, was reduced to
less than the half of that number. A negociation was
begun for the surrender of the citadel; but Boufflers made
such extravagant demands as were rejected with disdain.
Hostilities were renewed on the twenty-ninth day of the
month; and the Earl of Stair was detached to provide
corn for the army in the districts of Furnes and Dixmuyde.
During these transactions, Velt-Mareschal d'Auverquerque
died at Rousselaer, in the sixty-seventh year of his age,
after having, in above thirty campaigns, exhibited innu∣merable
proofs of uncommon courage, ability, and mode∣ration.
The Duke de Vendome did not yet despair of
obliging the confederates to abandon their enterprise; the
French ministers at Rome and Venice publickly declared
the allied army was cooped up in such a manner, that it
must either raise the siege or be famished. The Elector
of Bavaria, with a detachment of ten thousand men,
marched to Brussels, and attacked the counterscarp with
incredible fury; but was repulsed by the garrison, under
the command of General Paschal, and retired with preci∣pitation,
when he understood that the Duke of Marlbo∣rough
was in motion to relieve the place. This nobleman
and Prince Eugene no sooner understood the danger to
which Brussels was exposed, than they marched with the
covering-army to the Schelde, which they passed on pon∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oons
without opposition, notwithstanding the formidable
works which the French had raised. They now aban∣doned
them with precipitation, to the surprise of the con∣federates,
who had laid their account with the loss of a
thousand men in the attack. Having passed the river be∣tween
Eskenaffe and Hauterive, as well as at other places,
they marched to Oudenarde, where they received intelli∣gence
that the Elector had retreated. Then Prince Eugene
<PB N="137" REF="143"/>
returned to Lisle, and the Duke of Marlborough proceeded
to Brussels, where he was received with joy and acclama∣tion.
He afterwards took post at Oudenarde, so as to
maintain a communication with Prince Eugene.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. The besiegers having made lodgements,
and raised batteries on the second counterscarp of the ci∣tadel,
sent a message to Boufflers, intimating, that if he
would surrender before the opening of the batteries, he
should have an honourable capitulation; otherwise he and
his garrison must be made prisoners of war. He chose to
avoid the last part of the alternative: hostages were ex∣changed
on the eighth day of December, and the articles
signed on the tenth; when the Mareschal and his garrison
marched out with the honours of war, and were con∣ducted
to Douay. In this great enterprise, spirit and
perseverance made amends for want of foresight and skill,
which was slagrant on the side of the confederates; yet
their success was owing in a great measure to the improvi∣dence
and misconduct of the besieged. The French
generals never dreamed that the allies would attempt any
thing of consequence after the reduction of Lisle, consi∣dering
the advanced season of the year, and therefore they
returned to Paris, after having distributed their army into
winter quarters. But their indefatigable antagonists were
determined to strike another stroke of importance before
their forces should separate. On the twentieth day of
December they invested the city of Ghent on all sides;
and on the thirtieth, when the batteries were ready to
open, the Count de la Motte, who commanded the garri∣son,
desired to capitulate. On the third day of the next
month he marched out with thirty battalions and sixteen
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quadrons, which were conducted to Tournay; while the
Duke of Argyle, with six British battalions, took posses∣ion
of the town and citadel. Then the enemy abandoned
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruges, Plassendabl, and Lessengen; and the generals of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he allies, having settled the plan of winter quarters, re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aired
to Holland, leaving the forces under the command
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Count Tilly. The French King was confounded and
<PB N="138" REF="144"/>
dismayed at these conquests in the Netherlands. Nor was
he easy on the side of Dauphiné: in spight of all the vigi∣lance
and activity of Villars, the Duke of Savoy made
himself master of the important fortresses of Exilles, La
Perouse, the valley of St. Martin, and Fenestrelles; so
that by the end of the campaign he had secured a barrier
to his own frontiers, and opened a way into the French
provinces, after having made a diversion in favour of King
Charles, by obliging the enemy to send a strong detach∣ment
from Rou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illon to the assistance of Villars.</P>
<P>§ XXXIX. The campaign in Catalonia was productive
of a great event. Count Guido de Staremberg arrived at
Barcelona on the last day of April; but the Imperial troops
brought from Italy by Admiral Leake did not land in
time to relieve Tortosa, which the Duke of Orleans be∣sieged
and took, together with Denia, the garrison of
which were made prisoners of war, contrary to the arti∣cles
of capitulation. These losses, however, were abun∣dantly
made up to the allies by the conquest of Sardinia
and Minorca. Sir John Leake, having taken on board a
handful of troops, under the conduct of the Marquis
D'Alconzel, set sail for Cagliari, and summoned the
Viceroy to submit to King Charles. As he did not send
an immediate answer, the Admiral began to bombard the
city, and the inhabitants compelled him to surrender at
discretion. The greater part of the garrison inlisted them∣selves
in the service of Charles. The deputies of the states
being assembled by the Marquis D'Alconzel, acknow∣ledged
that prince as their sovereign, and agreed to furnish
his army with thirty thousand sacks of corn, which were
accordingly transported to Catalonia, where there was a
great scarcity of provision. Major-General Stanhope
having planned the conquest of Minorca, and concerted
with the Admiral the measures necessary to put it in exe∣cution,
obtained from Count Staremberg a few battalions
of Spaniards, Italians, and Portuguese: at the head of
these he embarked at Barcelona with a fine train of British
artillery, accompanied by Brigadier Wade and Colonel
<PB N="139" REF="145"/>
Petit, an engineer of great reputation. They landed on
the island, about two miles from St. Philip's fort, on the
twenty-sixth of August, with about eight hundred ma∣rines,
which augmented their number to about three
thousand. Next day they erected batteries; and General
Stanhope ordered a number of arrows to be shot into the
place, to which papers were affixed, written in the Spanish
and French languages, containing threats, that all the
garrison should be sent to the mines, if they would not
surrender before the batteries were finished. The garri∣son
consisted of a thousand Spaniards and six hundred
French marines, commanded by Colonel la Jonquiere,
who imagined that the number of the besiegers amounted
to at least ten thousand; so artfully had they been drawn
up in sight of the enemy. The batteries began to play,
and in a little time demolished four towers that served as
outworks to the fort: then they made a breach in the
outward wall, through which Brigadier Wade, at the head
of the grenadiers, stormed a redoubt, with such extraor∣dinary
valour as struck the besieged with consternation.
On the second or third day they thought proper to beat a
parley, and capitulate, on condition, That they should
march out with the honours of war: That the Spaniards
should be transported to Murcia, and the French to Toulon.
These last, however, were detained, by way of reprisal
for the garrison of Denia. The Spanish governor was
so mortified when he learned the real number of the be∣siegers,
that on his arrival at Murcia he threw himself
out of a window in despair, and was killed upon the spot.
La Jonquiere was confined for life, and all the French
officers incurred their master's displeasure. Fort St. Philip
being thus reduced, to the amazement of all Europe, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e garrison of Port Fornelles having surrendered them∣selves
prisoners to the Admirals Leake and Whitaker, the
inhabitants gladly submitted to the English government,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> King Philip had oppressed and deprived them of their
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rivileges: General Stanhope appointed Colonel Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it
Governour of Fort St. Philip, and deputy-governour of
<PB N="140" REF="146"/>
the whole island. After this important conquest he re∣turned
to the army in Spain, where an unsuccessful attempt
to surprise Tortosa finished the operations of the cam∣paign.</P>
<P>§ XL. The British fleet not only contributed to the
reduction of Minorca, but likewise over-awed the Pope,
who had endeavoured to form a league of the Princes in
Italy against the Emperor. This pontiff had manifested
his partiality to the house of Bourbon in such a palpable
manner, that his Imperial Majesty ordered Monsieur de
Bonneval to march with the troops that were in Italy,
re-enforced by those belonging to the Duke of Modena,
and invade the duchy of Ferrara. He accordingly took
possession of Comachio and some other places, pretend∣ing
they were allodial estates belonging to the Duke of
Modena, and fiefs of the Emperor, to which the Holy
see had no lawful claim. The Viceroy of Naples was
forbid to remit any money to Rome; and the council of
the kingdom drew up a long memorial, containing the
pretensions of his Catholick Majesty, which struck at
the very foundation of the Pope's temporal power. His
Holiness wrote a long remonstrance to the Emperor, on
the injustice of those proceedings, and declared that he
would assert this cause though he should lose his life in the
contest. He forthwith began to raise an army, and re∣vived
a plan of forming a league among the princes and
states of Italy, for their mutual defence. Sir John Leake
had received orders to bombard Civita-Vecchia, in re∣sentment
for the Pope's having countenanced the Pre∣tender's
expedition to Great-Britain; but as the Emperor
and Duke of Savoy hoped to effect an accommodation with
the court of Rome, they prevailed upon the English ad∣miral
to suspend hostilities until they should have tried the
method of negociation. The Marquis de Prie, a Piedmontese
nobleman, was sent as ambassador to Rome; but the Pope
would not receive him in that quality. Elated with the
promises of France, he set the Emperor at desiance; and
his troops having surprised a body of Imperialists, were so
<PB N="141" REF="147"/>
barbarous as to cut them all in pieces. The Duke of Savoy
having ended the campaign, the troops of the Emperor,
which had served under that prince, were ordered to march
into the papal territories, and drove the forces of his Ho∣liness
before them, without any regard to number. Bo∣logna
capitulated; and Rome began to tremble with the
apprehension of being once more sacked by a German
army. Then the Pope's courage failed; he was glad to
admit the Marquis de Prie as envoy from the Emperor.
He consented to disband his new levies; to accommodate
the Imperial troops with winter-quarters in the papal ter∣ritories;
to grant the investiture of Naples to King Charles;
and to allow at all times a passage to the Imperial troops
through his dominions. On the Upper Rhine the electors
of Bavaria and Hanover were so weak, that they could not
undertake any thing of consequence against each other.
In Hungary the disputes still continued between the Em∣peror
and the malcontents. Poland was at length deli∣vered
from the oppression exercised by the King of Sweden,
who marched into the Ukraine against the Czar of Mus∣covy,
notwithstanding the submissions with which that
monarch endeavoured to appease his indignation. During
the course of this year the English merchants sustained no
considerable losses by sea: the cruizers were judiciously
stationed, and the trade was regularly supplied with con∣voys.
In the West-Indies Commodore Wager destroyed
the admiral of the galleons, and took the rear-admiral on
the coast of Carthagena. Had the officers of his squadron
done their duty, the greatest part of the fleet would have
fallen into his hands. At his return to Jamaica two of
his captains were tried by a court-martial, and dismissed
from the service.</P>
<P>§ XLI. The court of England was about this time not
a little disquieted, by the consequences of an outrage
committed on the person of the Count de Matueof the
Muscovite ambassador. He was publickly arrested at the
suit of a laceman, and maltreated by the bailisss, who
dragged him to prison, where he continued until he was
<PB N="142" REF="148"/>
bailed by the Earl of Feversham. Incensed at this insult,
he demanded redress of the government, and was seconded
in his remonstrances by the ministers of the Emperor,
the King of Prussia, and several other foreign potentates.
The Queen expressed uncommon indignation against the
authors of this violence, who were immediately appre∣hended,
and orders were given to prosecute them with the
utmost severity of the law. Matueof repeated his com∣plaints
with great acrimony; and Mr. Secretary Boyle
assured him, in the Queen's name, that he should have
ample satisfaction. Notwithstanding this assurance, he
demanded a pass for himself and family; refused the or∣dinary
presents at his departure; and retired to Holland.
From thence he transmitted a memorial, with a letter from
the Czar to the Queen, insisting upon her punishing
with death all the persons concerned in violating the law
of nations upon the person of his ambassador. Such
punishment being altogether inconsistent with the laws of
England, the Queen and her ministry were extremely
perplexed, and held several councils, to deliberate upon
the measures proper to be taken on such an occasion.
On the twenty-eighth day of October, Prince George of
Denmark died of an asthma and dropsy, with which he had
been long afflicted. He was a prince of an amiable rather
than a shining character, brave, good-natured, modest,
and humane, but devoid of great talents and ambition.
He had always lived in harmony with the Queen, who,
during the whole term of their union, and especially in
his last illness, approved herself a pattern of conjugal
truth and tenderness. At his death the Earl of Pembroke
was created lord high-admiral, the Earl of Wharton pro∣moted
to the government of Ireland, and Lord Somers
appointed president of the council. Notwithstanding
these promotions of the Whig noblemen, the Duke of
Marlborough declined apace in his credit with the Queen,
who privately consulted and reposed her chief confidence
in Mr. Harley, though he had no visible concern in the ad∣ministration.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="149"/>
§ XLII. The new parliament, in which the Whig in∣terest
still preponderated, was assembled on the sixteenth day
of November, when they were given to understand, by a
commission under the great seal, that the Archbishop of
Canterbury, the Chancellor, the Lord-Treasurer, the
Lord-Steward, and the Master of the Horse, were appoint∣ed
to represent the person of her Majesty, whom decency
would not permit to appear in the House so soon after the
death of her consort. Sir Richard Onslow being chosen
speaker of the Lower-House with the Queen's approbation,
the Chancellor, in a speech to both Houses, recommended
the vigorous prosecution of the war, telling them her
Majesty hoped they would enable her to make a consi∣derable
augmentation for preserving and improving the
advantages which the allies had gained in the Netherlands:
that she desired they would prepare such bills as might
confirm and render the union effectual; and that if they
would propose means for the advancement of trade and
manufacture, she would take pleasure in enacting such
provisions. Both Houses having presented addresses of
condolance and congratulation, on the death of Prince
George, and the success of her Majesty's arms during the
last campaign, the Commons took cognizance of contro∣verted
elections, which were decided with shameful par∣tiality
for the Whig faction. Then they proceeded to
consider the different branches of the supply: they approved
of an augmentation of ten thousand men, which was
judged necessary for the more vigorous prosecution of the
war; and they voted above seven millions for the service of
the ensuing year. The Bank agreed to circulate two mil∣lions
five hundred thousand pounds in Exchequer bills for
the government, on condition that the term of their conti∣nuance
should be prolonged for one-and-twenty years; and
that their stock of two millions two hundred and one thou∣sand
one hundred and seventy-one pounds should be dou∣bled
by a new subscription. The two-thirds subsidy was
appropriated for the interest of the money raised by this
expedient.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="150"/>
§ XLIII. Great debates having arisen about Scottish
elections, the House considered the petitions and repre∣sentations
that were delivered, touching the incapacity of
the eldest sons of Scottish peers, excluded from sitting in
the parliament of Great-Britain. Counsel being heard
upon the subject, that incapacity was confirmed; and
new writs were issued, that new members might be elected
for the shires of Aberdeen and Linlithgow, in the room of
William Lord Haddo, and James Lord Johnstown. Peti∣tions
were likewise presented to the House of Lords by
some Scottish peers, concerning their right of voting, and
signing proxies. After warm debates, the House, upon a
division, determined that a Scottish lord created a peer
of Great-Britain should no longer retain his vote in
Scotland; and that the noblemen who were in the castle
of Edinburgh had a right to sign proxies, after having
taken the oaths to the government. The Scottish peers and
commoners that sat in the British parliament were divided
into two factions. The Duke of Queensberry was in great
credit with the Queen and the Lord-Treasurer, by whose
interest he was appointed secretary of state for Scotland.
His influence in elections was so great, that all offices in
that kingdom were bestowed according to his recommen∣dation.
He was opposed by the Dukes of Hamilton,
Montrose, and Roxburgh, who were supported by the
Earl of Sunderland and Lord Somers; so that the whole
interest of that country was engrossed by one or other mem∣ber
of the ministry. A bill for a general naturalization of
all protestants was brought into the House, and notwith∣standing
violent opposition from the Tories, both among the
Lords and Commons, was enacted into a law. The Whigs
argued for this bill, as a measure that would encourage
industry, improve trade and manufacture, and repair the
waste of men which the war had occasioned: but one of
their chief motives was to throw an addition of foreigners
into the balance against the landed interest. The Tories
pleaded, that a conflux of aliens might prove dangerous to
the constitution: that they would retain a fondness for
<PB N="145" REF="151"/>
their native countries, and, in times of war, act as spies
and enemies: that they would insinuate themselves into
places of trust and profit; become members of parliament;
and by frequent intermarriages contribute to the extinction
of the English race: that they would add to the number of
the poor, already so expensive; and share the bread of the
labourers and tradesmen of England.</P>
<P>§ XLIV. An enquiry being set on foot in both Houses,
concerning the late intended invasion of Scotland, Lord
Haversham and the other Tory members endeavoured to
demonstrate, that proper precautions had not been taken
for the security of that kingdom, even after the ministry
had received undoubted intelligence of the Pretender's
design: that since the attempt had miscarried, many per∣sons
of quality had been apprehended, and severely used
by the government, on pretended suspicion of high trea∣son;
though, in all probability, the aim of the ministry,
in confining those persons, was to remove all possi∣bility
of their opposing the court at the ensuing elections
for members of parliament. These assertions were sup∣ported
by many incontested facts and shrewd arguments,
notwithstanding which, the majority were so little disposed
to find fault, that the enquiry issued in a joint address to
the Queen, containing resolutions. That timely and
effectual care had been taken to disappoint the designs of
her Majesty's enemies, both at home and abroad. A bill,
however, was brought into the House of Lords, under the
title of “An act for improving the union of the two
kingdoms.” It related to trials for treason in Scotland,
which by this law were regulated according to the manner
of proceeding in England, with some small variation.
The Scottish members opposed it as an encroachment upon
the form of their laws; and they were joined by those who
had laid it down as a maxim to oppose all the court-mea∣sures:
nevertheless, the bill passed through both Houses,
and received the royal assent. Yet, in order to sweeten
this unpalatable medicine, the Queen consented to an act
of grace, by which all treasons were pardoned, except
<PB N="146" REF="152"/>
those committed on the high-seas: an exception levelled at
those who had embarked with the Pretender. Major-Gene∣ral
Webb, who had been defrauded of his due honour, in
a partial representation of the battle of Wynendale, trans∣mitted
by Cardonnel, secretary to the Duke of Marlbo∣rough,
was now thanked by the House of Commons for
the great and eminent services which he had performed in
that engagement.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> This motion was made by the Tories;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Daniel.</NOTE>
and the Whigs did not fail to procure a compliement of
the same nature to the Duke of Marlborough,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. of the D. of Marl∣borough.</NOTE> even before
he returned to England.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mil. Hist. Tindal.</NOTE> When the news of Ghent's
being taken arrived, the Lords and Commons congratu∣lated
the Queen on this last effort of a glorious campaign;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conduct of the Duchess of Marlbo∣rough.</NOTE>
and the Duke, at his arrival, was thanked, in the name of
the Peers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feuquieres.</NOTE> by the Lord Chancellor. As he was supposed
to have brought over proposals of peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quincy.</NOTE> the two Houses,
in an address,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the Admirals.</NOTE> desired the Queen would insist on the demo∣lition
of Dunkirk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hare.</NOTE> which was a nest of pirates that in∣fested
the ocean,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Voltaire.</NOTE> and did infinite prejudice to the com∣merce
of England. The Queen promised to comply with
their request. But she was not a little surprised at the
next address they presented, humbly entreating, that she
would have such indulgence to the hearty desires of her
subjects, as to entertain thoughts of a second marriage.
She told them, that the provision she had made for the
protestant succession would always be a proof how much
she had at heart the future happiness of the kingdom; but
the subject of this address was of such a nature, that she
was persuaded they did not expect a particular answer.</P>
<P>§ XLV. The laws having been found insufficient to
punish capitally the authors of the insult offered to the Mus∣covite
ambassador, a bill was brought into the House of
Commons for preserving the privileges of ambassadors and
other foreign ministers; and passed through both Houses:
as did another, to prevent the laying of wagers relating to
the publick, a practice which had been carried to a degree
of infatuation; and by which many unwary persons fell a
sacrifice to crafty adventurers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1709.</NOTE> On the fourteenth day of
<PB N="147" REF="153"/>
March the Commons voted the sum of one hundred and
three thousand two hundred and three pounds, for the
relief of the inhabitants of Nevis and St. Christopher's,
who had suffered by the late invasion: and on the twenty-first
day of April the parliament was prorogued. The
Muscovite ambassador continued to write expostulatory
letters to Mr. Secretary Boyle, who at last owned, that
the laws of the kingdom did not admit of such punishment
as he demanded. An information was tried in the court
of Queen's-Bench for her Majesty against Thomas Morton,
laceman, and thirteen other persons concerned in the in∣sult,
of which they were found guilty; and the special
matter of the privileges of ambassadors was to be argued
next term before the judges. Mean while, the Queen,
by way of satisfaction to the Czar, condescended to make
solemn excuses by her ambassador; to repair Matueof's
honour by a letter, and indemnify him for all his costs and
damages: concessions with which the Czar and his am∣bassador
declared themselves well satisfied. The convo∣cation
had been summoned, chosen, and returned with
the new parliament: but as the old spirit was supposed to
prevail in the Lower House, the Queen, by writ to the
Archbishop, ordered him to prorogue it from time to time,
until the session of parliament was finished.</P>

<PB N="149" REF="155"/>
<P>§ I. THE French King was by this time reduced to
such a state of humiliation by the losses of the
last campaign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. X. 1709.</NOTE> and a severe winter, which completed the
misery of his subjects, that he resolved to sacrifice all the
considerations of pride and ambition, as well as the interest
of his grandson, to his desire of peace, which was now be∣come
so necessary and indispensible. He dispatched the
president Rouillé privately to Holland, with general pro∣posals
of peace, and the offer of a good barrier to the
States-General, still entertaining hopes of being able to
detach them from the confederacy. This minister confer∣red
in secret with Buys and Vanderdussen, the pensionaries
of Amsterdam and Gouda, at Moerdyke, from whence he
was permitted to proceed to Woerden, between Leyden
and Utrecht. The States immediately communicated
his proposals to the courts of Vienna and Great-Britain.
Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough arrived at
the Hague in April, and conferred with the grand pen∣sionary
Heinsius, Buys, and Vanderdussen, on the subject
of the French proposals, which were deemed unsatisfactory.
Rouillé immediately dispatched a courier to Paris, for fur∣ther
instructions; and the Duke of Marlborough returned
to England, to make the Queen acquainted with the pro∣gress
of the negociation. Louis, in order to convince the
states of his sincerity, sent the Marquis de Torcy, his se∣cretary
for foreign affairs, to the Hague, with fresh offers,
to which the deputies would make no answer until they
<PB N="150" REF="156"/>
knew the sentiments of the Queen of Great-Britain. The
Duke of Marlborough crossed the seas a second time, ac∣companied
by the Lord Viscount Townshend, as am∣bassador
extraordinary, and joint-plenipotentiary: Prince
Eugene being likewise at the Hague, the conferences were
begun. The French minister declared that his master
would consent to the demolition of Dunkirk: that he
would abandon the Pretender, and dismiss him from his
dominions: that he would acknowledge the Queen's title
and the protestant succession: that he would renounce all
pretensions to the Spanish monarchy, and cede the places
in the Netherlands which the States-General demanded
for their barrier: that he would treat with the Emperor
on the footing of the treaty concluded at Ryswick, and
even demolish the fortifications of Strasburg. The mi∣nisters
of the allies, rendered proud and wanton by success,
and seeing their own private interest in the continuation
of the war, insisted upon the restitution of the Upper and
Lower Alsace to the empire: upon the French monarch's
restoring Strasburg in its present condition: upon his
ceding the town and castellany of Lisle, demolishing
Dunkirk, New-Brisac, Fort-Louis, and Hunningen. In
a word, their demands were so insolent, that Louis would
not have suffered them to be mentioned in his hearing, had
not he been reduced to the last degree of distress. One
can hardly read them without feeling a sentiment of com∣passion
for that monarch, who had once given law to Eu∣rope,
and been so long accustomed to victory and con∣quest.
Notwithstanding the discouraging dispatches he had
received from the president Rouillé, after his first confer∣ences
with the deputies, he could not believe that the
Dutch would be so blind to their own interest, as to reject
the advantages in commerce, and the barrier which he
had offered. He could not conceive that they would
choose to bear the burthen of excessive taxes in prosecuting
a war, the events of which would always be uncertain,
rather than enjoy the blessings of peace, security, and ad∣vantageous
commerce: he slattered himself, that the
<PB N="151" REF="157"/>
allies would not so far deviate from their purposed aim of
establishing a balance of power, as to throw such an enor∣mous
weight into the scale of the house of Austria, which
cherished all the dangerous ambition and arbitrary princi∣ples,
without the liberality and sentiment peculiar to the
house of Bourbon. In proportion as they rose in their de∣mands
Louis fell in his condescension. His secretary of
state, the Marquis de Torcy, posted in disguise to Hol∣land,
on the faith of a common blank passport. He sol∣licited,
he soothed, he supplicated, and made concessions
in the name of his sovereign. He found the States were
wholly guided by the influence of Prince Eugene and the
Duke of Marlborough. He found these generals elated,
haughty, overbearing, and implacable. He in private at∣tacked
the Duke of Marlborough on his weakest side: he
offered to that nobleman a large sum of money, provided
he would effect a peace on certain conditions. The pro∣posal
was rejected. The Duke found his enemies in Eng∣land
increasing, and his credit at court in the wane; and
he knew that nothing but a continuation of the war, and
new victories, could support his influence in England.
Torcy was sensible that his country was utterly exhausted:
that Louis dreaded nothing so much as the opening of the
campaign; and he agreed to those articles upon which
they insisted as preliminaries. The French King was
confounded at these proposals: he felt the complicated
pangs of grief, shame, and indignation. He rejected the
preliminaries with disdain. He even deigned to submit his
conduct to the judgment of his subjects. His offers were
published, together with the demands of the allies. His
people interested themselves in the glory of their monarch.
They exclaimed against the cruelty and arrogance of his
enemies. Though impoverished and half-starved by the
war, they resolved to expend their whole substance in his
support; and rather to fight his battles without pay, than
leave him in the dire necessity of complying with such
dishonourable terms. Animated by these sentiments,
they made such efforts as amazed the whole world. The
<PB N="152" REF="158"/>
preliminaries being rejected by the French King, Rouillé
was ordered to quit Holland in four-and-twenty hours; and
the generals of the confederates resolved to open the cam∣paign
without further hesitation.</P>
<P>§ II. Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough
proceeded to Flanders, and towards the end of June the
allied army encamped in the plain of Lisle, to the number
of one hundred and ten thousand fighting men. At the
same time, the Mareschal Villars, accounted the most
fortunate general in France, assembled the French forces
in the plain of Lens, where he began to throw up entrench∣ments.
The confedérate generals having observed his
situation, and perceiving he could not be attacked with any
probability of success, resolved to undertake the siege of
Tournay, the garrison of which Villars had imprudently
weakened. Accordingly, they made a feint upon Ypres,
in order to deceive the enemy, and convert all their atten∣tion
to that side, while they suddenly invested Tournay on
the twenty-seventh day of June. Though the garrison
did not exceed twelve weakened battalions, and four squa∣drons
of dragoons, the place was so strong, both by art
and nature, and Lieutenant de Surville, the governor, pos∣sessed
such admirable talents, that the siege was protracted,
contrary to the expectation of the allies, and cost them a
great number of men, notwithstanding all the precautions
that could be taken for the safety of the troops. As the
besiegers proceeded by the method of sap, their miners
frequently met with those of the enemy under ground, and
fought with bayonet and pistol. The volunteers on both
sides presented themselves to these subterraneous combats,
in the midst of mines and countermines ready primed for
explosion. Sometimes they were kindled by accident,
and sometimes sprung by design; so that great numbers
of those brave men were stifled below; and whole batta∣lions
blown into the air, or buried in the rubbish. On
the twenty-eighth day of July, the besiegers having effected
a practicable breach, and made the necessary dispositions
for a general assault, the enemy offered to capitulate: the
<PB N="153" REF="159"/>
town was surrendered upon conditions; and the garrison
retired to the citadel. Surville likewise entered into a treaty
about giving up the citadel: the articles being sent to the
court of Versailles, Louis would not ratify them, except
upon condition that there should be a general cessation in
the Netherlands till the fifth day of September. Hostilities
were renewed on the eighth day of August, and prosecuted
with uncommon ardour and animosity. On the thirtieth
Surville desired to capitulate on certain articles, which
were rejected by the Duke of Marlborough, who gave him
to understand that he had no terms to expect, but must
surrender at discretion. At length, his provision being
quite exhausted, he was obliged to surrender himself
and his garrison prisoners of war, though they were per∣mitted
to return to France, on giving their parole that
they would not act in the field until a like number of the
allies should be released.</P>
<P>§ III. The next object that attracted the eyes of the
confederates was the city of Mons, which they resolved to
besiege with all possible expedition. They passed the
Schelde on the third day of September, and detached the
Prince of Hesse to attack the French lines, from the Haisne
to the Sombre, which were abandoned at his approach.
On the seventh day of September, Mareschal de
Boufflers arrived in the French camp at Quievrain, content
to act in an inferior capacity to Villars, although his su∣perior
in point of seniority. The Duke of Marlborough
having received advice that the French were on the march
to attack the advanced body under the Prince of Hesse,
decamped from Havre, in order to support that detach∣ment.
On the ninth the allies made a motion to the left,
by which the two armies were brought so near each other,
that a mutual cannonading ensued. The French army,
amounting to one hundred and twenty thousand men, were
posted behind the woods of La Merte and Tanieres, in the
neighbourhood of Malplaquet. The confederates, nearly
of the same number, encamped with the right near Sart
and Bleron, and the lest on the edge of the wood of Lag∣niere;
<PB N="154" REF="160"/>
the head-quarters being at Blaregnies. The enemy,
instead of attacking the allies, began to fortify their camp,
which was naturally strong, with triple entrenchments.
In a word, they were so covered with lines, hedges, en∣trenchments,
cannon, and trees laid across, that they
seemed to be quite inaccessible. Had the confederates at∣tacked
them on the ninth, the battle would not have been
so bloody, and the victory would have proved more deci∣sive;
for they had not then begun to secure the camp; but
Marlborough postponed the engagement until they should
be re-enforced by eighteen battalions which had been em∣ployed
in the siege of Tournay; and, in the mean time,
the French fortified themselves with incredible diligence
and dispatch. On the eleventh day of September, early in
the morning, the confederates, favoured by a thick fog,
erected batteries on each wing, and in the centre; and
about eight o'clock, the weather clearing up, the at∣tack
began. Eighty-six battalions on the right, command∣ed
by General Schuylemburg, the Duke of Argyle, and
other generals, and supported by two-and-twenty battalion,
under Count Lottum, attacked the left of the enemy with
such vigour, that, notwithstanding their lines and barri∣cadoes,
they were in less than an hour driven from their
entrenchments, into the woods of Sart and Tanieres.
The Prince of Orange and Baron Fagel, with six-and-thirty
Dutch battalions, advanced against the right of the
enemy, posted in the wood of La Merte, and covered with
three entrenchments. Here the battle was maintained with
the most desperate courage on both sides. The Dutch
obliged the French to quit the first entrenchment; but were
repulsed from the second with great slaughter. The Prince
of Orange persisted in his efforts with incredible perseve∣rance
and intrepidity, even after two horses had been kil∣led
under him, and the greater part of his officers either
slain or disabled. The French sought with an obstinacy
of courage that bordered on despair, till seeing their lines
forced, their left wing and centre giving way, and their
general, Villars, dangerously wounded, they made an
<PB N="155" REF="161"/>
excellent retreat towards Bavay, under the conduct of
Boufflers, and took post between Quesnoy and Valen∣ciennes.
The field of battle they abandoned to the confede∣rates,
with about forty colours and standards, sixteen pieces
of artillery, and a good number of prisoners; but this was
the dearest victory the allies had ever purchased. About
twenty thousand of their best troops were killed in the
engagement; whereas the enemy did not lose half the
number, and retired at leisure, perfectly recovered of that
apprehension with which they had been for some years
inspired and overawed by the successes of their adversaries.
On the side of the allies, Count Lottum, General Tettau,
Count Oxienstern, and the Marquis of Tullibardine were
killed, with many other officers of distinction. Prince
Eugene was slightly wounded on the head: Lieutenant-General
Webb received a shot in the groin. The Duke
of Argyle, who distinguished himself by extraordinary
feats of valour, escaped unhurt; but several musket-balls
penetrated through his clothes, hat, and periwig. In the
French army, the Chevalier de St. George charged twelve
times with the household troops, and in the last was
wounded with a sword in the arm. The Mareschal de
Villars confidently asserted, that if he himself had not
been disabled, the confederates would certainly have been
defeated.</P>
<P>§ IV. Considering the situation of the French, the
number of their troops, and the manner in which they
were fortified, nothing could be more rash and imprudent
than the attack, which cost the lives of so many gallant
men, and was attended with so little advantage to the con∣querors.
Perhaps the Duke of Marlborough thought a vic∣tory
was absolutely necessary to support his sinking interest
at the court of Great-Britain. His intention was to have
given battle before the enemy had entrenched themselves;
but Prince Eugene insisted upon delaying the action until
the re-enforcement should arrive from Tournay. The ex∣traordinary
carnage is imputed to the impetuosity of the
Prince of Orange, whose aim, through this whole war.
<PB N="156" REF="162"/>
was to raise himself into consideration with the States-General,
by signal acts of military prowess. The French
having retired to Valenciennes, the allies were left at
liberty to besiege Mons, which capitulated about the end
of October; and both armies were distributed in winter-quarters.
The campaign on the Rhine produced nothing
but one sharp action, between a detachment of the French
army commanded by the Count de Borgh, and a body of
troops under Count Merci, who had passed the Rhine, in
order to penetrate into Franche-comté. The Imperial
officer was worsted in this encounter, with the loss of two
thousand men; obliged to repass the river, and retired to
Fribourg. In Piedmont, Velt-Mareschal Thaun com∣manded
the confederates, in the room of the Duke of
Savoy, who refused to take the field until some differences
which had arisen between the Emperor and him should be
adjusted. Thaun's design was to besiege Briançon; but
the Duke of Berwick had taken such precautions as fru∣strated
his intention, though part of the troops under the
French general were employed in suppressing an insur∣rection
of the Camisars, and other malcontents in the
Vivarez. These were entirely defeated in a pitched battle;
and Abraham, one of their leaders, being taken, was broke
alive upon the wheel; three-and-twenty were hanged,
and the other prisoners sent to the gallies. The Pope de∣layed
acknowledging King Charles, under various pre∣tences,
in hope that the campaign would prove favourable
to the House of Bourbon; till at length the Emperor giving
him to understand that his army should take up their
winter-quarters in the ecclesiastical state, his holiness
solemnly owned Charles as King of Spain, Naples, and
Sicily.</P>
<P>§ V. The military operations in Spain and Portugal
were unfavourable to the allies. On the seventh of May,
the Portuguese and English were defeated at Caya, by the
Spaniards under the command of the Mareschal de Bay.
The castle of Alicant, guarded by two English regiments,
had been besieged, and held out during the whole winter.
<PB N="157" REF="163"/>
At length the Chevalier d'Asfeldt ordered the rock to be
undermined, and having lodged two hundred barrels of
gunpowder, gave Syburg, the governor, to understand,
that two of his officers might come out and see the con∣dition
of the works. This offer being accepted, Asfeldt in
person accompanied them to the mine: he told them he
could not bear the thoughts of seeing so many brave men
perish in the ruins of a place they had so gallantly de∣fended;
and allowed them four-and-twenty hours to con∣sider
on the resolution they should take. Syburg continued
deaf to his remonstrances; and, with an obstinacy that
favoured more of stupidity than of valour, determined to
stand the explosion. When the sentinels that were posted
on the side of the hill gave notice, by a preconcerted
signal, that fire was set to the mine, the governor order∣ed
the guard to retire, and walked out to the parade,
accompanied by several officers. The mine being sprung,
the rock opened under their feet, and they falling into the
chasm, it instantly closed, and crushed them to death.
Notwithstanding this dreadful incident, Colonel d'Albon,
who succeeded to the command, resolved to defend the
place to the last extremity. Sir Edward Whitaker sailed
from Barcelona to the relief of the place; but the enemy
had erected such works as effectually hindered the troops
from landing. Then General Stanhope, who commanded
them, capitulated with the Spanish general for the garri∣son,
which marched out with all the honours of war, and
was transported to Minorca, where the men were put into
quarters of refreshment. On the frontiers of Catalonia,
General Staremberg maintained his ground, and even an∣noyed
the enemy. He passed the Segra, and reduced
Balaguer: having left a strong garrison in the place, he
repassed the river, and sent his forces into winter-quarters.
The most remarkable event of this summer was the
battle of Pultowa, in which the King of Sweden was
entirely defeated by the Czar of Muscovy, and obliged to
take refuge at Bender, a town of Moldavia, in the Turk∣ish
dominions. Augustus immediately marched into
<PB N="158" REF="164"/>
Poland against Stanislaus, and renounced his own resig∣nation,
as if it had been the effect of compulsion. He
formed a project with the Kings of Denmark and Prussia,
to attack the Swedish territories in three different places;
but the Emperor and maritime powers prevented the exe∣cution
of this scheme, by entering into a guaranty for
preserving the peace of the empire. Nevertheless, the
King of Denmark declared war against Sweden, and
transported an army over the Sound to Schonen; but they
were attacked and defeated by the Swedes, and obliged to
re-embark with the utmost precipitation. The war still
continued to rage in Hungary, where, however, the re∣volters
were routed in many petty engagements.</P>
<P>§ VI. Though the events of the summer had been less
unfavourable to France than Louis had reason to expect,
he saw that peace was as necessary as ever to his kingdom;
but he thought he might now treat with some freedom and
dignity. His minister, Torcy, maintained a correspondence
with Mr. Petkum resident of the Duke of Holstein at the
Hague: he proposed to this minister, that the negociation
should be renewed; and demanded passes, by virtue of
which the French plenipotentiaries might repair in safety
to Holland. In the mean time, the French King with∣drew
his troops from Spain, on pretence of demonstrating
his readiness to oblige the allies in that particular; though
this measure was the effect of necessity, which obliged him
to recall those troops for the defence of his own dominions.
The States-General refused to grant passes to the French
ministers; but they allowed Petkum to make a journey to
Versailles. In the interim King Philip published a mani∣festo,
protesting against all that should be transacted at
the Hague to his prejudice. Far from yielding Spain
and the Indies to his competitor, he declared his intention
of driving Charles from those places that were now in his
possession. He named the Duke of Alba, and Count
Bergheyck for his plenipotentiaries, and ordered them to
notify their credentials to the maritime powers; but no
regard was paid to their intimation. Philip tampered
<PB N="159" REF="165"/>
likewise with the Duke of Marlborough; and the Mar∣quis
de Torcy renewed his attempts upon that general;
but all his application and address proved ineffectual. Pet∣kum
brought back from Versailles a kind of memorial,
importing, That those motives which influenced the
French, before the campaign was opened, no longer sub∣sisted:
That the winter season naturally produced a cessa∣tion
of arms, during which he would treat of a general
and reasonable peace, without restricting himself to the
form of the preliminaries which the allies had pretended to
impose: That, nevertheless, he would still treat on the
foundation of those conditions to which he had consented,
and send plenipotentiaries to begin the conferences with
those of the allies, on the first day of January. The
States-General inveighed against this memorial, as a proof
of the French King's insincerity; though he certainly had
a right to retract those offers they had formerly rejected.
They came to a resolution, that it was absolutely neces∣sary
to prosecute the war with vigour; and they wrote
pressing letters on this subject to all their allies.</P>
<P>§ VII. The parliament of Great-Britain being assem∣bled
on the fifteenth day of November, the Queen, in her
speech, told both Houses, That the enemy had endea∣voured,
by false appearances, and deceitful insinuations of
a desire after peace, to create jealousies among the allies:
That God Almighty had been pleased to bless the arms of
the confederates with a most remarkable victory, and
other successes, which had laid France open to the impres∣sion
of the allied arms, and consequently rendered peace
more necessary to that kingdom than it was at the begin∣ning
of the campaign. She insisted upon the expediency
of prosecuting the advantages she had gained; by reducing
that exorbitant and oppressive power which had so long
threatened the liberties of Europe. The parliament were
as eager and compliant as ever. They presented con∣gratulatory
addresses: they thanked the Duke of Marl∣borough
for his signal services; while great part of the
nation reproached him with having wantonly sacrificed so
<PB N="160" REF="166"/>
many thousand lives to his own private interest and repu∣tation.
In less than a month, the Commons granted up∣wards
of six millions for the service of the ensuing year;
and established a lottery, with other funds, to answer
this enormous supply. On the thirteenth day of Decem∣ber,
Mr. Dolben, son to the late Archbishop of York,
complained to the House of two sermons preached and
published by Dr. Henry Sacheverel, rector of St. Saviour's,
in Southwark, as containing positions contrary to Revolu∣tion
principles, to the present government, and the pro∣testant
succession. Sacheveral was a clergyman of narrow
intellects, and an over-heated imagination. He had ac∣quired
some popularity among those who distinguished
themselves by the name of High-churchmen; and took all
occasions to vent his animosity against the dissenters. At
the summer assizes at Derby, he had held forth in that
strain before the judges; on the fifth day of November,
in St. Paul's church, he, in a violent declamation, de∣fended
the doctrine of non-resistance; inveighed against
the toleration and dissenters; declared the church was
dangerously attacked by her enemies; and slightly de∣fended
by her false friends: he sounded the trumpet for
the church, and exhorted the people to put on the whole
armour of God. Sir Samuel Garrard, the lord-mayor,
countenanced this harangue, which was published under his
protection, extolled by the Tories, and circulated all over
the nation. The complaint of Mr. Dolben against Sache∣verel
was seconded in the House of Commons by Sir
Peter King, and other members. The most violent para∣graphs
were read; the sermons were voted scandalous and
seditious libels. Sacheverel being brought to the bar of
the House, acknowledged himself the author of both, and
mentioned the encouragement he had received from the
lord mayor to print that which was intituled, “The perils
of false brethren.” Sir Samuel, who was a member, de∣nied
he had ever given him such encouragement. The
doctor being ordered to withdraw, the House resolved he
should be impeached of high crimes and misdemeanours;
<PB N="161" REF="167"/>
and Mr. Dolben was ordered to impeach him at the bar of the
House of Lords, in the name of all the Commons of Eng∣land.
A committee was appointed to draw up articles,
and Sacheverel was taken into custody. At the same time,
in order to demonstrate their own principles, they resolved,
That the Reverend Mr. Benjamin Hoadley, rector of St.
Peter's-Poor, for having often justified the principles on
which her Majesty and the nation proceeded in the late
happy revolution, had justly merited the favour and re∣commendation
of the House; and they presented an ad∣dress
to the Queen, beseeching her to bestow some dignity
in the church on Mr. Hoadley, for his eminent services
both to the church and state. The Queen returned a
civil answer, though she paid no regard to their recom∣mendation.
Hoadley was a clergyman of sound under∣standing,
unblemished character, and uncommon mode∣ration,
who, in a sermon preached before the Lord-Mayor
of London, had demonstrated the lawfulness of resisting
wicked and cruel governors; and vindicated the late revo∣lution.
By avowing such doctrines, he incurred the re∣sentment
of the high-churchmen, who accused him of
having preached up rebellion. Many books were written
against the maxims he professed. These he answered;
and, in the course of the controversy, acquitted himself
with superior temper, judgement, and solidity of argu∣ment.
He, as well as Bishop Burnet, and several other
prelates, had been treated with great virulence in Sache∣verel's
sermon; and the Lord-Treasurer was scurrilously
abused under the name of Volpene.</P>
<P>§ VIII. The doctor being impeached at the bar of the
Upper-House, petitioned that he might be admitted to
bail; but this indulgence was refused, and the Commons
seemed bent upon prosecuting him with such severity as
gave disgust to men of moderate principles. Mean while
the Tories were not idle. They boldly affirmed that the
Whigs had formed a design to pull down the church;
and that this prosecution was intended to try their strength,
before they would proceed openly to the execution of their
<PB N="162" REF="168"/>
project. These assertions were supported, and even
credited by great part of the clergy, who did not fail to
alarm and inflame their hearers; while emissaries were em∣ployed
to raise a ferment among the populace, already
prepared with discontent, arising from a scarcity which
prevailed in almost every country of Europe. The mini∣sters
magni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied the dangers to which the church was ex∣posed,
from dissenters, Whigs, and lukewarm prelates.
These they represented as the authors of a ruinous war,
which in a little time would produce universal samine;
and as the immediate encouragers of those Palatine re∣fugees
who had been brought over to the number of six
thousand, and maintained by voluntary contributions
until they could be conveniently transported into Ireland,
and the plantations in America. The charity bestowed
upon those unhappy strangers exasperated the poor of Eng∣land,
who felt severely the effects of the dearth, and
helped to fill up the measure of popular discontent. The
articles against Dr. Sacheverel being exhibited, his person
was committed to the deputy-usher of the black-rod; but,
afterwards, the Lords admitted him to bail. Then he
drew up an answer to the charge, in which he denied some
articles, and others he endeavoured to justify or extenuate.
The Commons having sent up a replication, declaring
they were ready to prove the charge, the Lords appointed
the twenty-seventh day of February for the trial, in West∣minster-hall.</P>
<P>§ IX. The eyes of the whole kingdom were turned upon
this extraordinary trial. It lasted three weeks, during
which all other business was suspended; and the Queen her∣self
was every day present, though in quality of a private
spectator. The managers for the Commons were Sir
Joseph Jekyl, Mr. Eyre, Sollicitor-General, Sir P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er
King, recorder of the city of London, Lieutenant-General
Stanhope, Sir Thomas Parker, and Mr. Robert Walpole,
treasurer of the navy. The doctor was defended by Sir
Simon Harcourt and Mr. Phipps, and assisted by Dr. At∣terbury,
Dr. Smallridge, and Dr. Friend. A vast multi∣tude
<PB N="163" REF="169"/>
attended him every day to and from Westminster-hall,
striving to kiss his hand, and praying for his deliverance,
as if he had been a martyr and confessor. The Queen's
sedan was beset by the populace, exclaiming, “God
bless your Majesty and the church. We hope your
Majesty is for Dr. Sacheverel.” They compelled all
persons to lift their hats to the doctor, as he passed in his
coach to the Temple, where he lodged; and among these
some members of parliament, who were abused and insulted.
They destroyed several meeting-houses; plundered the
dwelling-houses of eminent dissenters; and threatened to
pull down those of the Lord-Chancellor, the Earl of
Wharton, and the Bishop of Sarum. They even pro∣posed
to attack the Bank; so that the directors were
obliged to send to Whitehall for assistance. The horse and
foot guards were immediately sent to disperse the rioters,
who fled at their approach. Next day the guards were
doubled at Whitehall, and the trained-bands of West∣minster
continued in arms during the whole trial. The
Commons entreated the Queen, in an address, to take
effectual measures for suppressing the present tumults, set
on foot and fomented by papists, nonjurors, and other
enemies to her title and government. She expressed a
deep sense of their care and concern, as well as a just re∣sentment
at these tumultuous and violent proceedings. She
published a proclamation for suppressing the tumults; and
several persons being apprehended, were afterwards tried for
high-treason. Two of them were convicted, and sentenced to
die; but neither suffered. The Commons presented another
address of thanks to her Majesty, for her gracious answer to
their first remonstrance. They took this occasion to de∣clare,
that the prosecution of the Commons against Dr.
Henry Sacheverel proceeded only from the indispensable
obligation they lay under to vindicate the late happy revo∣lution,
the glory of their royal deliverer, her own title
and administration, the present establishment and protestant
succession, together with the toleration and the quiet of
the government. When the doctor's counsel had finished
<PB N="164" REF="170"/>
his defence, he himself recited a speech, wherein he so∣lemnly
justified his intentions towards the Queen and her
government; and spoke in the most respectful terms of
the Revolution, and the protestant succession. He main∣tained
the doctrine of non-resistance in all cases whatsoever,
as a maxim of the church in which he was educated; and
by many pathetical expressions endeavoured to excite the
compassion of the audience. He was surrounded by the
Queen's chaplains, who encouraged and extolled him as
the champion of the church; and he was privately favoured
by the Queen herself, who could not but relish a doctrine
so well calculated for the support of regal authority.</P>
<P>§ X. On the tenth day of March, the Lords being ad∣journed
to their own house, the Earl of Nottingham pro∣posed
the following question, “Whether, in prosecutions
by impeachments for high crimes and misdemeanours,
by writing or speaking, the particular words supposed
to be criminal are necessary to be expressly specified in
such impeachments?” The judges being consulted,
were unanimously of opinion, that, according to law, the
grounds of an indictment or impeachment ought to be
expressly mentioned in both. One of the lords having
suggested, that the judges had delivered their opinions
according to the rules of Westminster-hall, and not ac∣cording
to the usage of parliament, the Hense resolved,
that in impeachments they should proceed according to the
laws of the land, and the law and usage of parliaments.
On the sixteenth day of the month, the Queen being in
the House incognito, they proceeded to consider whether
or not the Commons had made good the articles exhibited
against Dr. Sacheverel. The Earl of Wharton observed,
that the doctor's speech was a full confutation and con∣demnation
of his sermon: that all he had advanced about
non-resistance and unlimited obedience was false and ridi∣culous:
that the doctrine of passive obedience, as urged by
the doctor, was not reconcileable to the practice of church∣men:
that if the Revolution was not lawful, many in that
House, and vast numbers without, were guilty of blood,
<PB N="165" REF="171"/>
murther, rapine, and injustice; and that the Queen her∣self
was no lawful sovereign, since the best title she had
to the crown, was her parliamentary title, founded
upon the Revolution. He was answered by the
Lord Haversham in a long speech. Lord Ferrers said,
if the doctor was guilty of some foolish unguarded expres∣sions,
he ought to have been tried at common law. The
Earl of Scarborough observed, the Revolution was a nice
point, and above the law: he moved that they should
adjourn the debate, and take time to consider before they
gave judgement. Doctor Hooper, Bishop of Bath and
Wells, allowed the necessity and legality of resistance in
some extraordinary cases; but was of opinion, that this
maxim ought to be concealed from the knowledge of the
people, who are naturally too apt to resist that the Revo∣lution
was not to be boasted of, nor made a precedent:
but that a mantle ought to be thrown over it, and it should
be called a vacancy or abdication. He said the original
compact were dangerous words, not to be mentioned with∣out
great caution: that those who examined the Revolution
too nicely were no friends to it; and that there seemed
to be a necessity for preaching up non-resistance and
passive obedience at that time, when resistance was justified.
The Duke of Argyle affirmed, that the clergy in all ages
had delivered up the rights and privileges of the people,
preaching up the King's power, in order to govern him
the more easily; and, therefore, they ought not to be suffer∣ed
to meddle with politicks. The Earl of Anglesey owned
the doctor had preached nonsense; but said that was no
crime. The Duke of Leeds distinguished between resist∣ance
and revolution; for, had not the last succeeded, it
would have certainly been rebellion, since he know of no
other but hereditary right. The Bishop of Salisbury justi∣fied
resistance from the book of Maccabees: he mentioned
the conduct of Queen Elisabeth, who assisted the Scots,
the French, and the States-General, in resisting their
different sovereigns, and was supported in this practice
both by her parliaments and her convocations. He observed
<PB N="166" REF="172"/>
that King Charles I. had assisted the citizens of Rochelle
in their rebellion: that Manwaring incurred a severe cen∣sure
from the parliament, for having broached the doctrine
of the divine right of kings; and that though this became
a favourite maxim after the restoration, yet its warmest
asserters were the first who pleaded for resistance when they
thought themselves oppressed. The Archbishop of York,
the Duke of Buckingham, and other leaders of the Tory
interest, declared that they never read such a piece of mad∣ness
and nonsense as Sacheverel's sermon; but they did
not think him guilty of a misdemeanour. Next day, Dr.
Wake, Bishop of Lincoln, accused Sacheverel of having
made a strange and false representation of the design for a
comprehension, which had been set on foot by Archbishop
Sancroft, and promoted by the most eminent divines of
the church of England. He was of opinion that some step
should be taken for putting a stop to such preaching,
as, if not timely corrected, might kindle heats and ani∣mosities
that would endanger both church and state. Dr.
Trimnel, Bishop of Norwich, expatiated upon the insolence
of Sacheverel, who had arraigned Archbishop Grindal, one
of the eminent reformers, as a persidious prelate, for
having favoured and tolerated the discipline of Geneva.
He enlarged upon the good effects of the toleration. He
took notice of Sacheverel's presumption in publishing in∣flammatory
prayers, declaring himself under persecution,
while he was prosecuted for offending against the law, by
those who in common justice ought to be thought the
fairest accusers, and before their lordships, who were justly
acknowledged to be the most impartial judges. In dis∣cussing
the fourth article, the Bishop of Salisbury spoke
with great vehemence against Sacheverel, who, by in∣veighing
against the Revolution, toleration, and union,
seemed to arraign and attack the Queen herself; since her
Majesty had so great a share in the first; had often declared
she would maintain the second; and that she looked upon
the third as the most glorious event of her reign. He
affirmed that nothing could be more plain than the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="167" REF="173"/>
reflecting upon her Majesty's ministers; and that he had
so well marked out a noble peer there present, by an ugly
and scurrilous epither which he would not repeat, that
it was not possible to mistake his meaning. Some of the
younger peers could not help laughing at this undesigned
sarcasm upon the Lord-Treasurer, whom Sacheverel had re∣viled
under the name of Volpone: they exclaimed, “Name
him, name him;” and, in all probability, the zealous
bishop, who was remarkable for absence of mind and un∣guarded
expressions, would have gratified their request, had
not the Chancellor, interposing, declared that no peer was
obliged to say more than he should think proper.</P>
<P>§ XI. After obstinate disputes, and much virulent alter∣cation,
Sacheverel was found guilty by a majority of seven∣teen
voices; and four-and-thirty peers entered a protest
against this decision. He was prohibited from preaching for
the term of three years; his two sermons were ordered to be
burnt by the hands of the common hangman, in presence of
the Lord-Mayor and the two sheriffs of London and Mid∣dlesex.
The Lords likewise voted that the executioner
should commit to the same fire the famous decree passed in
the convocation of the university of Oxford, asserting the
absolute authority and indefeasible right of princes. A
like sentence was denounced by the Commons upon a book
intituled, “Collections of passages referred to by Dr. Sa∣cheverel,
in his answer to the articles of impeachment.”
These he had selected from pious books lately published,
and they were read by his counsel, as proofs that the church
was in danger. The lenity of the sentence passed upon
Sacheverel, which was in a great measure owing to the dread
of popular resentment, his friends considered as a victory
obtained over a Whig faction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1710.</NOTE> and they celebrated their
triumph with bonsires and illuminations.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>net.</NOTE> On the fifth day
of April,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hare.</NOTE> the Queen ordered the parliament to be pro∣rogued,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Torcy.</NOTE>
after having,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feuquieres.</NOTE> in her speech to both Houses, expres∣sed
her concern for the necessary occasion which had taken
up great part of their time towards the latter end of the
session.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. of the D. of Marl∣borough. Tindal. Voltane.</NOTE> She declared that no prince could have a more true
<PB N="168" REF="174"/>
and tender concern for the welfare and prosperity of the
church than she had,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1710.</NOTE> and should always have; and she
said it was very injurious to take a pretence from wicked
and malicious libels, to insinuate that the church was in
danger by her administration.</P>
<P>§ XII. The French King, seeing the misery of his people
daily increase, and all his resources fail, humbled himself
again before the allies, and by the means of Petkurn, who
still corresponded with his ministers, implored the States-General,
that the negociation might be resumed. In order
to facilitate their consent, he dispatched a new project of
pacification, in which he promised to renounce his grand∣son,
and to comply with all their other demands, provided
the Electors of Cologn and Bavaria should be re-establish∣ed
in their estates and dignities. These overtures being
rejected, another plan was offered, and communicated to
the plenipotentiaries of the Emperor and Queen of Great-Britain.
Then Petkum wrote a letter to the Marquis de
Torcy, intimating, that the allies required his most Chri∣stian
Majesty should declare, in plain and expressive terms,
that he consented to all the preliminaries, except the thirty-seventh
article, which stipulated a cessation of arms, in
case the Spanish monarchy should be delivered to King
Charles in the space of two months. He said, the allie,
would send passports to the French ministers, to treat of
an equivalent for that article. Louis was even forced to
swallow this bitter draught. He signified his consent, and
appointed the Mareschal D'Uxelles and the Abbé Po∣lignae
his plenipotentiaries. They were not suffered,
however, to enter Holland, but were met by the Deputies
Buys and Vanderdussen at Gertruydenberg. Mean while,
the States desired the Queen of England to send over the
Duke of Marlborough, to assist them with his advice in
these conferences. The two Houses of parliament second∣ed
their request in a joint address to her Majesty, who told
them she had already given directions for his departure:
and said she was glad to find they concurred with her in a
just sense of the Duke's eminent services. Both the letter
<PB N="169" REF="175"/>
and the address were procured by the interest o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Marlbo∣rough,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. X. 1710.</NOTE>
to let the Queen see how much that nobleman was
considered both at home and abroad. But she was already
wholly alienated from him in her heart, and these expedi∣ents
served only to increase her disgust.</P>
<P>§ XIII. The French ministers were subjected to every
species of mortification. They were in a manner con∣fined
to a small fortified town, and all their conduct
narrowly watched. Their accommodation was mean:
their letters were opened; and they were daily insulted
by injurious libels. The Dutch deputies would hear of
no relaxation, and no expedient for removing the dissi∣culties
that retarded the negociation. In vain the pleni∣potentiaries
declared, that the French King could not
with decency, or the least regard to his honour, wage
war against his own grandson: the deputies insisted upon
his effecting the cession of Sapin and the Indies to the house
of Austria; and submitting to every other article specified
in the preliminaries. Nay, they even reserved to them∣selves
a power of making ulterior demands after the pre∣liminaries
should be adjusted. Louis proposed that some
small provision should be made for the Duke of Anjou,
which might induce him to relinquish Spain the more easily.
He mentioned the kingdom of Arragon; and this hint
being disagreeable to the allies, he demanded Naples and
Sicily. When they urged that Naples was already in
possession of the house of Austria, he restricted the pro∣vision
to Sicily and Sardinia. He offered to deliver up
four cautionary towns in Flanders, as a security for Philip's
evacuating Spain; and even promised to supply the con∣federates
with a monthly sum of money, to desray the
expense of expelling that prince from his dominions,
should he refuse to resign them with a good grace. The
substance of all the conferences was communicated to
Lord Townshend, and Count Zinzendors, the Imperial
plenipotentiary; but the conduct of the deputies was re∣gulated
by the Pensionary Heinsius, who was firmly at∣tached
to Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough,
<PB N="170" REF="176"/>
more averse than ever to a pacification. The negociatio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
lasted from the nineteenth day of March to the twenty
fifth of July, during which term the conferences we<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
several times interrupted, and a great many dispatches and
new proposals arrived from Versailles. At length, the ple∣nipotentiaries
returned to France, after having sent a letter
to the Pensionary, in which they declared, that the pro∣posals
made by the deputies were unjust and impracticable;
and complained of the unworthy treatment to which they
had been exposed. Louis resolved to hazard another cam∣paign,
not without hope, that there might be some lucky
incidents in the events of war, and that the approaching
revolution in the English ministry, of which he was well
apprised, would be productive of a more reasonable paci∣fication.
The States-General resolved, That the enemy
had departed from the foundation on which the negoci∣ation
had begun, and studied pretences to evade the exe∣cution
of the capital points, the restitution of Spain and
the Indies; and, in short, that France had no other view
than to sow and create jealousy and disunion among the
allies. Lord Townshend, in a memorial, assured them, that
the Queen entirely approved their resolution, and all the
steps they had taken in the course of the negociation;
and that she was firmly resolved to prosecute the war with
all possible vigour, until the enemy should accept such
terms of peace as might secure the tranquillity of the
Christian world.</P>
<P>§ XIV. The conferences did not retard the operations
of the campaign. Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marl∣borough
set out from the Hague on the fifteenth day of
March for Tournay, in order to assemble the forces which
were quartered on the Maese, in Flanders, and B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abant.
On the twentieth of April, they suddenly advanced to
Font-a-Vendin, in order to attack the lines upon which
the French had been at work all the winter, hoping by
these to cover Douay and other frontier towns, which were
threatened by the consederates. The troops left for the
defence of the lines retired without opposition. The allies
<PB N="171" REF="177"/>
having laid bridges over the Scarpe, the Duke of Marl∣borough
with his division passed that river, and encamped
at Vitri. Prince Eugene remained on the other side, and
invested Douay, the enemy retiring towards Cambray.
Mareschal Villars still commanded the French army,
which was extremely numerous and well appointed, con∣sidering
the distress of that kingdom. Indeed, the number
was augmented by this distress; for many thousands saved
themselves from dying of hunger, by carrying arms in the
service. The mareschal having assembled all his forces,
passed the Schelde, and encamped at Boucham, declaring
that he would give battle to the confederates; an alteration
was immediately made in the disposition of the allies, and
proper precautions taken for his reception. He advanced
in order of battle; but having viewed the situation of
the confederates, he marched back to the heights of St.
Laurence, where he fixed his camp. His aim was by
continual alarms to interrupt the siege of Douay, which
was vigorously defended by a numerous garrison, under the
command of Monsieur Albergotti, who made a number of
successful sallies, in which the besiegers lost a great num∣ber
of men. They were likewise repulsed in several
assaults; but still proceeded with unremitting vigour,
until the besieged being reduced to the last extremity, were
obliged to capitulate on the twenty-sixth of June, fifty
days after the trenches had been opened. The generals
finding it impracticable to attack the enemy, who were
posted with strong lines from Arras towards Miramont,
resolved to besiege Bethune, which was invested on the
fifteenth day of July, and surrendered on the twenty-ninth
of August. Villars marched out of his entrenchments
with a view to raise the siege; but he did not think proper
to hazard an engagement: some warm skirmishes, however,
happened between the soragers of the two armies. After
the reduction of Bethune, the allies besieged at one time
the towns of Aire and St. Venant, which were taken
without much difficulty. Then the armies broke up, and
marched into winter-quarters.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="178"/>
§ XV. The campaign on the Rhine was productive of
no military event: nor was any thing of consequence
transacted at Piedmont. The Duke of Savoy being in∣disposed
and out of humour, the command of the forces
still continued vested in Count Thaun, who endeavoured
to pass the Alps, and penetrate into Dauphiné; but the
Duke of Berwick had cast up entrenchments in the moun∣tains,
and taken such precautions to guard them, as
bassled all the attempts of the Imperial general. Spain
was much more fruitful of military incidents. The horse
and dragoons in the army of King Charles, headed by
General Stanhope, attacked the whole cavalry of the ene∣my
at Almennara. Stanhope charged in person, and with
his own hand slew General Amessaga, who commanded
the guards of Philip. The Spanish horse were entirely
routed, together with nine battalions that escaped by
favour of the darkness; and the main body of the army
retired with precipitation to Lerida. General Starem∣berg
pursued them to Saragossa, where he found them
drawn up in order of battle; and an engagement ensuing
on the ninth day of August, the enemy were totally defeat∣ed:
five thousand of their men were killed, seven thousand
taken, together with all their artillery, and a great number
of colours and standards. King Charles entered Sara∣gossa
in triumph, while Philip with the wreck of his army
retreated to Madrid. Having sent his Queen and son to
Victoria, he retired to Valladolid, in, order to collect his
scattered troops, so as to form another army. The good
fortune of Charles was of short duration. Stanhope pro∣posed
that he should immediately secure Pampeluna, the
only pass by which the French King could send troops to
Spain: but this salutary scheme was rejected. King
Charles proceeded to Madrid, which was deserted by all
the grandees; and he had the mortification to see that the
Castilians were universally attached to his competitor.</P>
<P>§ XVI. While his forces continued cantoned in the
neighbourhood of Toledo, the King of France, at the
request of Philip, sent the Duke de Vendome to take the
<PB N="173" REF="179"/>
command of the Spanish army, which was at the same
time re-enforced by detachments of French troops. Ven∣dome's
reputation was so high, and his person so beloved
by the soldiery, that his presence was almost equivalent
to an army. A great number of volunteers immediately
assembled to signalize themselves under the eye of this
renowned general. The Castilians were inspired with
fresh courage, and made surprising efforts in favour of
their sovereign; so that in less than three months after his
defeat at Saragossa, he was in a condition to go in quest
of his rival. Charles, on the other hand, was totally ne∣glected
by the courts of Vienna and Great-Britain, which
took no steps to supply his wants, or enable him to prose∣cute
the advantages he had gained. In the beginning of
November his army marched back to Saragossa, and was
cantoned in the neighbourhood of Cifuentes, where
Staremberg established his head-quarters. General Stan∣hope,
with the British forces, was quartered in the little
town of Brihuega, where, on the twenty-seventh day of
the month, he found himself suddenly surrounded by the
whole Spanish army. As the place was not tenable, and
he had very little ammunition, he was obliged, after a
short but vigorous resistance, to capitulate, and surrender
himself and all his forces prisoners of war, to the amount
of two thousand men, including three lieutenant-generals,
one major-general, one brigadier, with all the colonels and
officers of the respective regiments. He was greatly cen∣sured
for having allowed himself to be surprised; for, if
he had placed a guard upon the neighbouring hills, ac∣cording
to the advice of General Carpenter, he might have
received notice of the enemy's approach time enough to
retire to Cifuentes. Thither he had detached his aide-du∣camp
wito an account of his situation, on the appearance
of the Spanish army; and Staremberg immediately as∣sembled
his forces. About eleven in the forenoon they
began to march towards Brihuega; but the roads were so
bad, that night overtook them before they reached the
heights in the neighbourhood of that place. Staremberg
<PB N="174" REF="180"/>
is said to have loitered away his time unnecessarily, from
motives of envy to the English general, who had surren∣dered
before his arrival. The troops lay all night on their
arms near Villa-viciosa, and on the twenty-ninth were
attacked by the enemy, who doubled their number. Sta∣remberg's
lest wing was utterly defeated, all the infantry
that composed it having been either cut in pieces or, taken:
but the victors, instead of following the blow, began to
plunder the baggage; and Staremberg with his right wing
fought their left with surprising valour and perseverance
till night. Then they retired in disorder, leaving him
master of the field of battle and of all their artillery. Six
thousand of the enemy were killed on the spot; but the
allies had suffered so severely that the general could not
maintain his ground. He ordered the cannon to be nailed
up, and marched to Saragossa, from whence he retired to
Catalonia. Thither he was pursued by the Duke de
Vendome, who reduced Balaguer, in which he had left
a garrison, and compelled him to take shelter under the
walls of Barcelona. At this period the Duke de Noailles
invested Gironne, which he reduced, notwithstanding the
severity of the weather: so that Philip, from a fugitive, be∣came
in three months absolute master of the whole Spanish
monarchy, except the province of Catalonia, and even
that lay open to his incursions. Nothing of consequence
was atchieved on the side of Portugal, from whence the
Earl of Galway returned to England by the Queen's per∣mission.
The operations of the British fleet, during this
summer, were so inconsiderable as scarce to deserve notice.
Sir John Norris commanded in the Mediterranean, and
with a view to support the Camisars, who were in arms in
the Cevennes, sailed to port Cette, within a league of Mar∣seilles,
and at the distance of fifteen from the insurgents.
The place surrendered, without opposition, to about seven
hundred men that landed under the command of Major-General
Saissan, a native of Languedoc. He likewise made
himself master of the town and castle of Ayde; but the
<PB N="175" REF="181"/>
Duke de Noailles advancing with a body of forces to
join the Duke de Roquelaire, who commanded in those
parts, the English abandoned their conquests, and re-em∣barked
with precipitation. After the battle of Pultowa
the Czar of Muscovy reduced all Livonia; but he and
King Augustus agreed to a neutrality for Pomerania.
The King of Sweden continued at Bender, and the Grand
Signor interested himself so much in behalf of that prince,
as to declare war against the Emperor of Russia. Hostili∣ties
were carried on between the Swedish and Danish fleets
with various success. The malcontents in Hungary su∣stained
repeated losses during the summer; but they were
encouraged to maintain the war by the rupture between
the Ottoman Porte and Russia. They were flattered with
hopes of auxiliaries from the Turks; and expected engi∣neers
and money from the French monarch.</P>
<P>§ XVII. In England, the effects of those intrigues
which had been formed against the Whig ministers began
to appear. The trial of Sacheverel had excited a popular
spirit of aversion to those who favoured the dissenters.
From all parts of the kingdom addresses were presented to
the Queen, censuring all resistance as a rebellious doctrine,
founded upon antimonarchical and republican principles.
At the same time counter addresses were procured by the
Whigs, extolling the Revolution, and magnifying the con∣duct
of the present parliament. The Queen began to ex∣press
her attachment to the Tories, by mortifying the
Duke of Marlborough. Upon the death of the Earl of
Essex she wrote to the General, desiring that the regi∣ment
which had been commanded by that nobleman
should be given to Mr. Hill, brother to Mrs. Masham, who
had supplanted the Duchess of Marlborough in the Queen's
friendship, and was in effect the source of this political
revolution. The Duke represented to her Majesty, in
person, the prejudice that would redound to the service
from the promotion of such a young officer over the heads
of a great many brave men, who had exhibited repeated
proofs of valour and capacity. He expostulated with his
<PB N="176" REF="182"/>
sovereign on this extraordinary mark of partial regard to
the brother of Mrs. Masham, which he could not help con∣sidering
as a declaration against himself and his family,
who had so much cause to complain of that lady's malice
and ingratitude. To this remonstrance the Queen made no
other reply, but that he would do well to consult his friends.
The Earl of Godolphin enforced his friend's arguments,
though without effect; and the Duke retired in disgust to
Windsor. The Queen appeared at council without taking
the least notice of his absence, which did not fail to alarm
the whole Whig faction. Several noblemen ventured to
speak to her Majesty on the subject, and explain the bad
consequences of disobliging a man who had done such emi∣nent
services to the nation. She told them his services
were still fresh in her memory; and that she retained all
her former kindness for his person. Hearing, however,
that a popular clamour was raised, and that the House of
Commons intended to pass some votes that would be dis∣agreeable
to her and her new counsellors, she ordered the
Earl of Godolphin to write to the Duke, to dispose of the
regiment as he should think proper, and return to town
immediately. Before he received this intimation he had
sent a letter to the Queen, desiring she would permit him
to retire from business. In answer to this petition, she
assured him his suspicions were groundless, and insisted
upon his coming to council. The Duchess demanded an
audience of her Majesty, on pretence of vindicating her
own character from some aspersions. She hoped to work
upon the Queen's tenderness, and retrieve the influence
she had lost. She protested, argued, wept, and suppli∣cated:
but the Queen was too well pleased with her own
deliverance from the tyranny of the other's friendship, to
incur such slavery for the future. All the humiliation of
the Duchess served only to render herself the more con∣temptible.
The Queen heard her without exhibiting the
least sign of emotion, and all she would vouchsafe, was a
repetition of these words, “You desired no answer, and
you shall have none:” alluding to an expression in a
<PB N="177" REF="183"/>
letter she had received from the duchess. As an addi∣tional
mortification to the ministry, the office of lord∣chamberlain
was transferred from the Duke of Kent to
the Duke of Shrewsbury, who had lately voted with the
Tories, and maintained an intimacy of correspondence
with Mr. Harley. The interest of the Duke of Marlbo∣rough
was not even sufficient to prevent the dismission of
his own son-in-law, the Earl of Sunderland, from the
post of secretary of state, in which he was succeeded by
Lord Dartmouth.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. The Queen was generally applauded for
thus asserting her just prerogative, and setting herself free
from an arbitrary cabal, by which she had been so long
kept in dependence. The Duke of Beaufort went to court
on this occasion, and told her Majesty, he was extremely
glad that he could now salute her Queen in reality. The
whole Whig party were justly alarmed at these alterations.
The directors of the bank represented to her Majesty the
prejudice that would undoubtedly accrue to public credit
from a change of the ministry. The Emperor and the
States-General interposed in this domestic revolution.
Their ministers at London presented memorials, explaining
in what manner foreign affairs would be influenced by an
alteration in the British ministry. The Queen assured
them, that, whatever changes might be made, the Duke of
Marlborough should be continued in his employments.
In the month of August the Earl of Godolphin was divested
of his office, and the Treasury put in commission, subjected
to the direction of Harley, appointed chancellor of the
Exchequer and under-treasurer. The Earl of Rochester
was declared president of the council, in the room of Lord
Somers: the staff of lord-steward being taken from the
Duke of Devonshire, was given to the Duke of Bucking∣ham;
and Mr. Boyle was removed from the secretary's
office, to make way for Mr. Henry St. John. The Lord-Chancellor
having resigned the great seal, it was first put
in commission, and afterwards given to Sir Simon Har∣court.
The Earl of Wharton surrendered his commission
<PB N="178" REF="184"/>
of lord-lieutenant of Ireland, which the Queen conferred
on the Duke of Ormond. The Earl of Orford withdrew
himself from the board of Admiralty; and Mr. George
Granville was appointed secretary of war, in the room of
Mr. Robert Walpole. The command of the forces in
Portugal was bestowed upon the Earl of Portmore: the
Duke of Hamilton was appointed lord-lieutenant of the
county palatine of Lancaster. In a word, there was not
one Whig left in any office of state, except the Duke of
Marlborough, who would have renounced his command,
had not he been earnestly dissuaded by his particular friends
from taking such a step as might have been prejudicial to
the interest of the nation. That the triumph of the Tories
might be complete, the Queen dissolved the Whig par∣liament,
after such precautions were taken as could not
fail to influence the new election in favour of the other
party.</P>
<P>§ XIX. To this end nothing so effectually contributed
as did the trial of Sacheverel, who was used as an instru∣ment
and tool to wind and turn the passions of the vulgar.
Having been presented to a benefice in North-Wales, he
went in procession to that country, with all the pomp and
magnificence of a sovereign prince. He was sumptu∣ously
entertained by the university of Oxford, and different
noblemen, who, while they worshipped him as the idol of
their faction, could not help despising the object of their
adoration. He was received in several towns by the ma∣gistrates
of the corporation in their formalities, and often
attended by a body of a thousand horse. At Bridgenorth
he was met by Mr. Creswell, at the head of four thousand
horse, and the like number of persons on foot, wearing
white knots edged with gold, and three leaves of gilt
laurel in their hats. The hedges were for two miles
dressed with garlands of flowers, and lined with people;
and the steeples covered with streamers, flags, and colours.
Nothing was heard but the cry of “the church and Dr.
Sacheverel.” The clergy were actuated by a spirit of
enthusiasm, which seemed to spread like a contagion
<PB N="179" REF="185"/>
through all ranks and degrees of people, and had such
effect upon the elections for the new parliament, that very
few were returned as members but such as had distinguished
themselves by their zeal against the Whig administration.
Now the Queen had the pleasure to see all the offices of
state, the lieutenancy of London, the management of
corporations, and the direction of both Houses of parlia∣ment
in the hands of the Tories. When these met on
the twenty-fifth day of November, Mr. Bromley was
chosen speaker without opposition. The Queen, in her
speech, recommended the prosecution of the war with
vigour, especially in Spain. She declared herself resolved
to support the church of England; to preserve the British
constitution according to the union; to maintain the in∣dulgence
by law allowed to scrupulous consciences; and
to employ none but such as were heartily attached to the
protestant succession in the house of Hanover. The Lords,
in their address, promised to concur in all reasonable mea∣sures
towards procuring an honourable peace. The Com∣mons
were more warm and hearty in their assurances,
exhorting her Majesty to discountenance all such princi∣ples
and measures as had lately threatened her royal crown
and dignity; measures, which, whenever they might pre∣vail,
would prove fatal to the whole constitution, both in
church and state. After this declaration they proceeded
to consider the estimates, and chearfully granted the sup∣plies
for the ensuing year, part of which was raised by two
lotteries. In the House of Peers, the Earl of Scarborough
moved that the thanks of the House should be returned
to the Duke of Marlborough; but the Duke of Argyle
made some objections to the motion, and the general's
friends, dreading the consequence of putting the question,
postponed the consideration of this proposal until the Duke
should return from the continent. The Earl of Peter∣borough
was appointed ambassador extraordinary to the
Imperial court: the Earl of Rivers was sent in the same
quality to Hanover; Mr. Richard Hill was nominated
envoy extraordinary to the United Provinces, as well as
<PB N="180" REF="186"/>
to the council of state appointed for the government of the
Spanish Netherlands, in the room of Lieutenant-General
Cadogan. Meredith, Macartney, and Honeywood were
deprived of their regiments, because in their cups they
had drunk confusion to the enemies of the Duke of Marl∣borough.</P>
<P>§ XX. This nobleman arrived in England towards the
latter end of December. He conferred about half an hour
in private with the Queen, and next morning assisted at a
committee of the privy-council. Her Majesty gave him
to understand that he needed not to expect the thanks of
the parliament as formerly; and told him she hoped he
would live well with her ministers. He expressed no re∣sentment
at the alterations which had been made; but re∣solved
to acquiesce in the Queen's pleasure, and retain the
command of the army on her own terms. On the second
day of January, the Queen sent a message to both Houses,
intimating that there had been an action in Spain to the
disadvantage of King Charles; that the damage having
fallen particularly on the English forces, she had given di∣rections
for sending and procuring troops to repair the
loss, and hoped the parliament would approve her conduct.
Both Houses seised this opportunity of venting their spleen
against the old ministry. The history of England is dis∣graced
by the violent conduct of two turbulent factions,
which, in their turn, engrossed the administration and legis∣lative
power. The parliamentary strain was quite altered.
One can hardly conceive how resolutions so widely differ∣ent
could be taken on the same subject, with any shadow of
reason and decorum. Marlborough, who but a few
months before had been so highly extolled and caressed by
the representatives of the people, was now become the
object of parliamentary hatred and censure, though no
sensible alteration had happened in his conduct or success.
That hero, who had retrieved the glory of the British arms,
won so many battles, subdued such a number of towns
and districts, humbled the pride, and checked the am∣bition
of France, secured the liberty of Europe; and, as
<PB N="181" REF="187"/>
it were, chained victory to his chariot wheels; was in a
few weeks dwindled into an object of contempt and derisi∣on.
He was ridiculed in publick libels, and reviled in
private conversation. Instances were every where repeated
of his fraud, avarice, and extortion; his insolence, cruelty,
ambition, and misconduct: even his courage was called in
question; and this consummate general was represented
as the lowest of mankind. So unstable is the popularity
of every character that fluctuates between two opposite
tides of faction.</P>
<P>§ XXI. The Lords, in their answer to the Queen's mes∣sage,
declared, that as the misfortune in Spain might have
been occasioned by some preceding mismanagement, they
would use their utmost endeavours to discover it, so as to
prevent the like for the future. They set on foot an
enquiry concerning the affairs of Spain; and the Earl of
Peterborough being examined before the committee, im∣puted
all the miscarriages in the course of that war to the
Earl of Galway and General Stanhope. Notwithstanding
the defence of Galway, which was clear and convincing,
the House resolved, That the Earl of Peterborough had
given a faithful and honourable account of the councils
of war in Valencia: That the Earl of Galway, Lord
Tyrawley, and General Stanhope, in advising an offen∣sive
war, had been the unhappy occasion of the battle at
Almanza, the source of our misfortunes in Spain, and one
great cause of the disappointment from the expedition to
Toulon, concerted with her Majesty. They voted, That
the prosecution of an offensive war in Spain was approved
and directed by the ministers, who were, therefore, justly
blameable, as having contributed to all our misfortunes
in Spain, and to the disappointment of the expedition
against Toulon: That the Earl of Peterborough, during
his command in Spain, had performed many great and
eminent services; and, if his opinion had been followed,
it might have prevented the misfortunes that ensued. Then
the Duke of Buckingham moved, That the thanks of the
House should be given to the Earl, for his remarkable and
<PB N="182" REF="188"/>
eminent services; and these he actually received from the
mouth of the Lord-Keeper Harcourt, who took this oppor∣tunity
to drop some oblique reflexions upon the merce∣nary
disposition of the Duke of Marlborough. The House
proceeding in the enquiry, passed another vote, importing,
That the late ministry had been negligent in managing the
Spanish war, to the great prejudice of the nation. Find∣ing
that the Portuguese troops were posted on the right of
the English at the battle of Almanza, they resolved, that
the Earl of Galway, in yielding this point, had acted con∣trary
to the honour of the imperial crown of Great-Britain.
These resolutions they included in an address to the Queen,
who had been present during the debates, which were ex∣tremely
violent; and to every separate vote was attached a
severe protest. These were not the proceedings of candour
and national justice, but the ebullitions of party zeal and
rancorous animosity.</P>
<P>§ XXII. While the Lords were employed in this en∣quiry,
the Commons examined certain abuses which had
crept into the management of the navy; and some cen∣sures
were passed upon certain persons concerned in con∣tracts
for victualling the seamen. The inhabitants of St.
Olave's and other parishes presented a petition, complain∣ing
that a great number of Palatines inhabiting one house
might produce among them a contagious distemper; and
in time become a charge to the publick, as they were
destitute of all visible means of subsistence. This petition
had been procured by the Tories, that the House of Com∣mons
might have another handle for attacking the late
ministry. A committee was appointed to enquire upon
what invitation or encouragement those Palatines had
come to England. The papers relating to this affair being
laid before them by the Queen's order, and perused, the
House resolved, That the inviting and bringing over the
poor Palatines of all religions, at the publick expense,
was an extravagant and unreasonable charge to the king∣dom,
and a scandalous misapplication of the publick
money, tending to the increase and oppression of the poor,
<PB N="183" REF="189"/>
and of dangerous consequence to the constitution in church
and state; and, That whoever advised their being brought
over was an enemy to the Queen and kingdom. Ani∣mated
by the heat of this enquiry, they passed the bill to
repeal the act for a general naturalization of all protestants:
but this was rejected in the House of Lords. Another
bill was enacted into a law, importing, That no person
should be deemed qualified for representing a county in
parliament, unless he possessed an estate of six hundred
pounds a-year; and restricting the qualification of burgess
to half that sum. The design of this bill was to exclude
trading people from the House of Commons, and to lodge
the legislative power with the land-holders. A third act
passed, permitting the importation of French wine in neu∣tral
bottoms; a bill against which the Whigs loudly ex∣claimed,
as a national evil, and a scandalous compliment
to the enemy.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. A violent party in the House of Commons be∣gan
to look upon Harley as a lukewarm Tory, because he
would not enter precipitately into all their factious measures:
they even began to suspect his principles, when his credit was
re-established by a very singular accident. Guiscard, the
French partisan, of whom mention hath already been made,
thought himself very ill rewarded for his services, with a
precarious pension of four hundred pounds, which he en∣joyed
from the Queen's bounty. He had been renounced
by St. John the former companion of his pleasures: he
had in vain endeavoured to obtain an audience of the
Queen, with a view to demand more considerable appoint∣ments.
Harley was his enemy, and all access to her Ma∣jesty
was denied. Enraged at these disappointments, he
attempted to make his peace with the court of France,
and offered his services, in a letter to one Moreau, a
banker, in Paris. This packet, which he endeavoured to
transmit by the way of Portugal, was intercepted, and a
warrant issued out to apprehend him for high-treason.
When the messenger disarmed him in St. James's park,
he exhibited marks of guilty confusion and despair, and
<PB N="184" REF="190"/>
begged that he would kill him directly. Being conveyed
to the cockpit, in a sort of frenzy, he perceived a pen∣knife
lying upon a table, and took it up without being
perceived by the attendants. A committee of council
was immediately summoned, and Guiscard brought before
them to be examined. Finding that his correspondence with
Moreau was discovered, he desired to speak in private with
Secretary St. John, whom, in all probability, he had re∣solved
to assassinate. His request being refused, he said,
“That's hard! not one word!” St. John being out of
his reach, he stepped up to Mr. Harley, and exclaiming,
“Have at thee, then!” stabbed him in the breast with the
penknife which he had concealed. The instrument broke
upon the bone, without penetrating into the cavity; never∣theless,
he repeated the blow with such force, that the
Chancellor of the Exchequer fell to the ground. Secretary
St. John, seeing him fall, cried out, “The villain has
killed Mr. Harley!” and drew his sword. Several other
members followed his example, and wounded Guiscard in
several places. Yet he made a desperate defence, until he
was overpowered by the messengers and servants, and con∣veyed
from the council-chamber, which he had filled with
terrour, tumult, and confusion. His wounds, though dan∣gerous,
were not mortal; but he died of a gangrene oc∣casioned
by the bruises he had sustained. This attempt
upon the life of Harley, by a person who wanted to esta∣blish
a traiterous correspondence with France, extinguished
the suspicions of those who began to doubt that minister's
integrity. The two Houses of parliament, in an address
to the Queen, declard their belief, that Mr. Harley's
fidelity to her Majesty, and zeal for her service, had
drawn upon him the hatred of all the abettors of popery
and faction.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> They besought her Majesty to take all pos∣sible

<PB N="185" REF="191"/>
Commons after his recovery, he was congratulated upon
it by the Speaker, in a florid and fulsome premediated
speech. An act was passed, decreeing, That an attempt
upon the life of a privy-counsellor should be felony with∣out
benefit of clergy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conduct of the Duchess of Marlbo∣rough.</NOTE> The Earl of Rochester dying,

titles of Oxford and Mortimer:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Volataire.</NOTE> to crown his pro∣sperity,
he was appointed lord-treasurer, and vested with
the supreme administration of affairs.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. The Commons empowered certain persons
to examine all the grants made by King William,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1711.</NOTE> and re∣port
the value of them, as well as the considerations upon
which they were made. Upon their report a bill was
formed, passed that House; but the Lords rejected it
at the first reading. Their next step was to examine the
publick accounts, with a view to fix an imputation on the
Earl of Godolphin. They voted, That above five-and-thirty
millions of the money granted by parliament remained
unaccounted for. This sum, however, included some ac∣counts
in the reigns of King Charles and King William.
One half of the whole was charged to Mr. Bridges, the
paymaster, who had actually accounted for all the money
he had received, except about three millions, though these
accounts had not passed through the auditor's office. The
Commons afterwards proceeded to enquire into the debts
of the navy, that exceeded five millions, which, with many
other debts, were thrown into one stock, amounting to nine
millions four hundred and seventy-one thousand three
hundred and twenty-five pounds. A fund was formed for
paying an interest or annuity of six per cent. until the
principal should be discharged; and with this was granted
a monopoly of a projected trade to the South-Sea, vested
in the proprietors of navy-bills, debentures, and other
publick securities, which were incorporated for this pur∣pose.
Such was the origin of the South-Sea company,
founded upon a chimerical supposition, that the English
would be permitted to trade upon the coast of Peru in the
<PB N="186" REF="192"/>
West-Indies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK 1. 1711.</NOTE> Perhaps the new ministry hoped to ob∣tain
this permission, as an equivalent for their abandoning
the interest of King Charles, with respect to his preten∣sions
upon Spain. By this time the Emperor Joseph had
died of the small-pox without male issue; so that his bro∣ther's
immediate aim was to succeed him on the Imperial
throne. This event was, on the twentieth day of April,
communicated by a message from the Queen to both
Houses. She told them, that the States-General had con∣curred
with her in a resolution to support the House of
Austria; and that they had already taken such measures
as would secure the election of Charles as head of the em∣pire.</P>
<P>§ XXV. The House of Commons, in order to demon∣strate
their attachment to the church, in consequence of
an address from the lower house of convocation, and a
quickening message from the Queen, passed a bill for build∣ing
fifty new churches in the suburbs of London and Westminster,
and appropriated for this purpose the duty upon
coals, which had been granted for the building of St.
Paul's, now finished. This imposition was continued
until it should raise the sum of three hundred and fifty
thousand pounds. At the close of the session, the Com∣mons
presented a remonstrance or representation to the
Queen, in which they told her, that they had not only
raised the necessary supplies, but also discharged the heavy
debts of which the nation had so long and justly com∣plained.
They said, that, in tracing the causes of this
debt, they had discovered fraud, embezzlement, and mis∣application
of the publick money: that they who of late
years had the management of the Treasury were guilty of
a notorious breach of trust and injustice to the nation, in
allowing above thirty millions to remain unaccounted for;
a purposed omission that looked like a design to conceal
embezzlements. They begged her Majesty would give
immediate directions for compelling the several imprest ac∣countants
speedily to pass their accounts. They expressed
their hope, that such of the accountants as had neglected
<PB N="187" REF="193"/>
their duty in prosecuting their accounts ought no longer
to be entrusted with the publick money.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. X. 1711.</NOTE> They affirmed,
that from all these evil practices and worse designs of some
persons, who had, by false professions of love to their coun∣try,
insinuated themselves into her royal favour, irrepara∣ble
mischief would have accrued to the publick, had not
her Majesty, in her great wisdom, seasonably discovered
the fatal tendency of such measures, and removed from the
administration those who had so ill answered her Majesty's
favourable opinion, and in so many instances grosly abused
the trust reposed in them. They observed, that her people
could with greater patience have suffered the manifold
injuries done to themselves, by the frauds and depredations
of such evil ministers, had not the same men proceeded to
treat her sacred person with undutifulness and disregard.
This representation being circulated through the kingdom,
produced the desired effect of inflaming the minds of the
people against the late ministry. Such expedients were
become necessary for the execution of Oxford's project,
which was to put a speedy end to a war that had already
subjected the people to grievous oppression, and even
accumulated heavy burthens to be transmitted to their
posterity. The nation was inspired by extravagant ideas
of glory and conquest, even to a rage of war-making; so
that the new ministers, in order to dispel those dangerous
chimeras, were obliged to take measures for exciting their
indignation and contempt against those persons whom they
had formerly idolised as their heroes and patriots. On the
twelfth day of June, the Queen having given the royal
assent to several publick and private bills, made an assec∣tionate
speech to both Houses. She thanked the Com∣mons,
in the warmest expressions, for having complied
with all her desires; for having bassled the expectations of
her enemies in finding supplies for the service of the en∣suing
year; in having granted greater sums than were ever
given to any prince in one session; and in having settled
funds for the payment of the publick debts, so that the
credit of the nation was restored. She expressed her earnest
<PB N="188" REF="194"/>
concern for the succession of the house of Hanover; and
her fixed resolution to support and encourage the church of
England as by law established. Then the parliament was
prorogued.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. Of the convocation which was assembled
with the new parliament, the lower house chose Dr.
Atterbury their prolocutor. He was an enterprising ec∣clesiastick,
of extensive learning, acute talents, violently
attached to Tory principles, and intimately connected
with the prime minister, Oxford; so that he directed all
the proceedings in the lower house of convocation, in
concert with that minister. The Queen, in a letter to the
archbishop, signified her hope, that the consultations of
the clergy might be of use to repress the attempts of loose
and profane persons. She sent a license under the broad
feal, empowering them to sit and do business in as ample
a manner as ever had been granted since the reformation.
They were ordered to lay before the Queen an account of
the excessive growth of infidelity and heresy, as well as of
other abuses, that necessary measures might be taken for
a reformation. The bishops were purposely slighted and
overlooked, because they had lived in harmony with the
late ministers. A committee being appointed to draw up
a representation of the present state of the church and re∣ligion,
Atterbury undertook the talk, and composed a re∣monstrance
that contained the most keen and severe stric∣tures
upon the administration, as it had been exercised
since the time of the Revolution. Another was penned
by the bishops in more moderate terms; and several regu∣lations
were made, but in none of these did the two
Houses agree. They concurred, however, in censuring
some tenets savouring Arianism, broached and supported
by Mr. Whiston, mathematical professor in Cambridge.
He had been expelled the university, and wrote a vindi∣cation
of himself, dedicated to the convocation. The
archbishop doubted whether this assembly could proceed
against a man for heresy: the judges were consulted, and
the majority of them gave in their opinion, that the con∣vocation
<PB N="189" REF="195"/>
had a jurisdiction. Four of them professed the
contrary sentiment, which they maintained from the
statutes made at the reformation. The Queen, in a letter
to the bishops, said, that as there was now no doubt of
their jurisdiction, she expected they would proceed in the
matter before them. Fresh scruples arising, they deter∣mined
to examine the book, without proceeding against the
author, and this was censured accordingly. An extract
of the sentence was sent to the Queen; but she did not
signify her pleasure on this subject, and the affair remained
in suspense. Whiston published a work in four volumes,
justifying his doctrine, and maintaining that the aposto∣lical
constitutions were not only canonical, but also
preferable in point of authority to the epistles and the
gospel.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. The new ministry had not yet determined to
supersede the Duke of Marlborough in the command of
the army. This was a step which could not be taken
without giving umbrage to the Dutch and other allies.
He, therefore, set out for Holland in the month of Febru∣ary,
after the Queen had assured him, that he might depend
upon the punctual payment of the forces. Having con∣ferred
with the deputies of the States about the operations
of the campaign, he, about the middle of April, assembled
the army at Orchies, between Lisle and Douay; while
Mareschal de Villars drew together the French troops in
the neighbourhood of Cambray and Arras. Louis had
by this time depopulated as well as impoverished his king∣dom;
yet his subjects still flocked to his standard with
surprising spirit and attachment. Under the pressure of
extreme misery they uttered not one complaint of
their sovereign; but imputed all their calamities to the
pride and obstinacy of the allies. Exclusive of all the other
impositions that were laid upon that people, they con∣sented
to pay the tenth penny of their whole substance:
but all their efforts of loyalty and affection to their prince
would have been ineffectual, had not the merchants of the
kingdom, by the permission of Philip, undertaken
<PB N="190" REF="196"/>
repeated voyages to the South-Sea, from whence they brought
home immense treasures; while the allies took no steps for
intercepting these supplies, though nothing could have
been more easy for the English than to deprive the enemy
of this great resource, and convert it to their own ad∣vantage.
Had a squadron of ships been annually employed
for this purpose, the subjects of France and Spain must
have been literally starved, and Louis obliged to submit
to such terms as the confederates might have thought
proper to impose. Villars had sound means to assemble a
very numerous army, with which he encamped behind the
river Sanset, in such an advantageous post as could not be
attacked with any prospect of success. Mean while the
Duke of Marlborough passed the Scarpe, and formed his
camp between Douay and Bouchain, where he was joined
by Prince Eugene on the twenty-third day of May. This
general, however, did not long remain in the Netherlands.
Understanding that detachments had been made from the
army of Villars to the Rhine, and that the Elector of
Bavaria intended to act in the empire, the Prince, by order
from the court of Vienna, marched towards the Upper
Rhine with the Imperial and Palatine troops, to secure
Germany. The Duke of Marlborough repassing the
Scarpe, encamped in the plains of Lens, from whence he
advanced towards Aire, as if he had intended to attack
the French lines in that quarter. These lines, beginning
at Bouchain on the Schelde, were continued along the
Sanset and the Scarpe to Arras, and thence along the Upper
Scarpe to Canché. They were defended by redoubts and
other works, in such a manner, that Villars judged they
were impregnable, and called them the <HI>Ne plus ultra</HI> of
Marlborough.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. This nobleman advancing within two
leagues of the French lines, ordered a great number of
fascines to be made, declaring he would attack them the
next morning; so that Villars drew all his forces on that
side, in full expectation of an engagement. The Duke,
on the supposition that the passage of the Sanset by
<PB N="191" REF="197"/>
Arleux would be left unguarded, had ordered the Generals
Cadogan and Hompesch to assemble twenty battalions
and seventeen squadrons from Douay and the neighbour∣ing
garrisons, to march to Arleux, where they should en∣deavour
to pass the Sanset. Brigadier Sutton was de∣tached
with the artillery and pontoons, to lay bridges over
the canal near Goulezen, and over the Scarpe at Vitry,
while the Duke, with the whole confederate army, began
his march for the same place about nine in the evening.
He proceeded with such expedition, that by five in the morn∣ing
he passed the river at Vitry. There he received intelli∣gence,
that Hompesch had taken possession of the passes
on the Sanset and Schelde without opposition, the enemy
having withdrawn their detachments from that side, just
as he had imagined. He himself, with his vanguard of
fifty squadrons, hastened his march towards Arleux, and
before eight of the clock arrived at Bacá-Bachuel, where
in two hours he was joined by the heads of the columns
into which he had divided his infantry. Villars being
certified of his intention, about two in the morning, de∣camped
with his whole army, and putting himself at the
head of the King's household troops, marched all night with
such expedition, that about eleven in the sorenoon he was
in sight of the Duke of Marlborough, who had by this
time joined Count Hompesch. The French general im∣mediately
retreated to the main body of his army, which
had advanced to the high-road between Arras and Cam∣bray,
while the allies encamped upon the Schelde, between
Oisy and Estrun, after a march of ten leagues without
halting, scarce to be paralleled in history. By this plan,
so happily executed, the Duke of Marlborough fairly out∣witted
Villars, and, without the loss of one man, en∣tered
the lines which he had pronounced impregnable.
This stroke of the English general was extolled as a
master-piece of military skill, while Villars was exposed
to the ridicule even of his own officers. The field de∣puties
of the States-General proposed that he should give
battle to the enemy, who passed the Schelde at Creve∣coeur,
<PB N="192" REF="198"/>
in order to cover Bouchain: but the Duke would
not hazard an engagement, considering how much the
army was fatigued by the long march; and that any mis∣fortune,
while they continued within the French lines,
might be fatal. His intention was to besiege Bouchain;
an enterprise that was deemed impracticable, inasmuch as
the place was situated in a morass, strongly fortified, and
defended by a numerous garrison, in the neighbourhood
of an army superior in number to that of the allies.
Notwithstanding these disadvantages, and the dissuasions
of his own friends, he resolved to undertake the siege;
and, in the mean time, dispatched Brigadier Sutton to
England, with an account of his having passed the French
lines; which was not at all agreeable to his enemies. They
had prognosticated that nothing would be done during
this campaign, and began to insinuate that the Duke
could strike no stroke of importance without the assistance
of Prince Eugene. They now endeavoured to lessen the
glory of his success; and even taxed him with having
removed his camp from a convenient situation to a place
where the troops were in danger of starving. Nothing
could be more provoking than this scandalous malevo∣lence
to a great man who had done so much honour to
his country, and was then actually exposing his life in her
service.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. On the tenth day of August, Bouchain was
invested, and the Duke of Marlborough exerted himself
to the utmost extent of his vigilance and capacity, well
knowing the difficulties of the undertaking, and how much
his reputation would depend upon his success. Villars
had taken every precaution that his skill and experience
could suggest, to baffle the endeavours of the English
general. He had re-enforced the garrison to the number of
six thousand chosen men, commanded by officers of known
courage and ability. He made some efforts to raise the
siege; but they were rendered ineffectual by the consum∣mate
prudence and activity of the Duke of Marlborough.
Then he laid a scheme for surprising Douay, which
<PB N="193" REF="199"/>
likewise miscarried. If we consider that the English gene∣ral,
in the execution of his plan, was obliged to form lines,
erect regular forts, raise batteries, throw bridges over a
river, make a causeway through a deep morass, provide for
the security of convoys against a numerous army on one
side, and the garrisons of Condé and Valenciennes on the
other, we must allow this was the boldest enterprise
of the whole war; that it required all the fortitude,
skill, and resolution of a great general, and all the va∣lour
and intrepidity of the confederate troops, who had
scarce ever exhibited such amazing proofs of courage upon
any other occasion as they now displayed at the siege
of Bouchain. In twenty days after the trenches were
opened, the garrison were obliged to surrender themselves
prisoners of war; and this conquest was the last military
exploit performed by the Duke of Marlborough: the
breaches of Bouchain were no sooner repaired than the
opposite armies began to separate, and the allied forces
were quartered in the frontier towns, that they might be
at hand to take the field early in the spring. They were
now in possession of the Maese, almost as far as the Sambre;
of the Schelde from Tournay; and of the Lys as far as it
is navigable. They had reduced Spanish Guelderland,
Limburg, Brabant, Flanders, and the greatest part of
Hainault: they were masters of the Scarpe; and, by the
conquest of Bouchain, they had opened to themselves a
way into the very bowels of France. All these acquisi∣tions
were owing to the valour and conduct of the Duke
of Marlborough, who now returned to the Hague, and
arrived in England about the middle of November.</P>
<P>§ XXX. The Queen had conferred the command of her
forces in Spain upon the Duke of Argyle, who was re∣called
from the service in Flanders for that purpose. He
had long been at variance with the Duke of Marlborough;
a circumstance which recommended him the more strongly
to the ministry. He landed at Barcelona on the twenty-ninth
of May, and found the British troops in the utmost
distress for want of subsistence. The Treasurer had pro∣mised
<PB N="194" REF="200"/>
to supply him liberally; the Commons had granted
one million five hundred thousand pounds for that service.
All their hopes of success were fixed on the campaign in
that kingdom; and indeed the army commanded by the
Duke de Vendome was in such a wretched condition,
that if Staremberg had been properly supported by the
allies, he might have obtained signal advantages. The
Duke of Argyle, having waited in vain for the promised
remittances, was obliged to borrow money on his own
credit, before the British troops could take the field. At
length Staremberg advanced towards the enemy, who
attacked him at the pass of Prato del Rey, where they
were repulsed with considerable damage. After this
action the Duke of Argyle was seised with a violent fever,
and conveyed back to Barcelona. Vendome invested the
castle of Cardona, which was vigorously defended till the
end of December, when a detachment being sent to the
relief of the place, defeated the besiegers, killed two thou∣sand
on the spot, and took all their artillery, ammu∣nition,
and baggage. Staremberg was unable to follow
the blow; the Duke of Argyle wrote pressing letters to
the ministry, and loudly complained that he was altogether
unsupported; but all his remonstrances were ineffectual;
no remittances arrived; and he returned to England
without having been able to attempt any thing of impor∣tance.
In September, King Charles, leaving his queen
at Barcelona, set sail for Italy, and at Milan had an in∣terview
with the Duke of Savoy, where all disputes were
compromised. That prince had forced his way into
Savoy, and penetrated as far as the Rhine; but he sud∣denly
halted in the middle of his career, and after a short
campaign repassed the mountains. Prince Eugene, at the
head of the German forces, protected the Electors at
Franckfort from the designs of the enemy, and Charles was
unanimously chosen Emperor; the Electors of Cologn and
Bavaria having been excluded from voting, because they
lay under the ban of the empire. The war between the
Ottoman Porte and the Muscovites was of short duration.
<PB N="195" REF="201"/>
The Czar advanced so far into Moldavia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. X. 1711.</NOTE> that he was cut
off from all supplies, and altogether in the power of his
enemy. In this emergency, he found means to corrupt
the Grand-Visir in private, while in public he proposed
articles of peace that were accepted. The King of Sweden,
who was in the Turkish army, charged the Visir with
treachery, and that minister was actually disgraced. The
Grand Signor threatened to renew the war; but he was
appeased by the Czar's surrendering Asoph.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. The English ministry had conceived great
expectations from an expedition against Quebeck and
Placentia, in North America, planned by Colonel Ni∣cholson
who had taken possession of Nova-Scotia, and
garrisoned Port-Royal, to which he gave the name of An∣napolis.
He had brought four Indian chiefs to England,
and represented the advantages that would redound to the
nation, in point of commerce, should the French be ex∣pelled
from North-America. The ministers relished the
proposal. A body of five thousand men was embarked in
transports, under the command of Brigadier Hill, brother
to Mrs. Masham; and they sailed from Plymouth in the
beginning of May, with a strong squadron of ships com∣manded
by Sir Hovenden Walker. At Boston in New-England,
they were joined by two regiments of Provin∣cials;
and about four thousand men, consisting of Ameri∣can
planters, Palatines, and Indians, rendezvoused at
Albany, in order to march by land into Canada, while
the fleet sailed up the river of that name. On the twenty-first
day of August, they were exposed to a violent storm,
and driven among rocks, where eight transports perished,
with about eight hundred men. The admiral immediate∣ly
sailed back to Spanish-River bay, where it was deter∣mined,
in a council of war, that as the fleet and forces
were victualled for ten weeks only, and they could not
depend upon a supply of provisions from New-England,
they should return home, without making any further at∣tempt.
Such was the issue of this paltry expedition,
<PB N="196" REF="202"/>
entrusted to the direction of an officer without talents and
experience.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1711.</NOTE></P>
<P>§ XXXII. In the Irish parliament held during the
summer, the Duke of Ormond and the majority of the
Peers supported the Tory-interest, while the Commons
expressed the warmest attachment to Revolution principles.
The two Houses made strenuous representations, and
passed severe resolutions against each other. After the
session, Sir Constantine Phipps, the chancellor, and General
Ingoldsby, were appointed justices in the absence of the
Duke of Ormond, who returned to England in the month
of November. In Scotland the Jacobites made no scruple
of professing their principles and attachments to the Pre∣tender.
The Duchess of Gordon presented the faculty
of Advocates with a silver medal, representing the Chevalier
de St. George; and on the reverse the British islands,
with the motto “<HI>Redditte.</HI>” After some debate, it was
voted, by a majority of sixty-three voices against twelve,
that the Duchess should be thanked for this token of her
regard. This task was performed by Dundass of Arni∣stoun,
who thanked her grace for having presented them
with a medal of their sovereign lord the King; hoping,
and being confident, that her grace would very soon have
an opportunity to compliment the Faculty with a second
medal, struck upon the restoration of the King and royal
family, upon the finishing rebellion, usurping tyranny,
and whiggery. An account of this transaction being laid
before the Queen, the Lord-Advocate was ordered to enquire
into the particulars. Then the Faculty were so intimi∣dated
that they disowned Dundass, and Horne his accom∣plice.
They pretended that the affair of the medal had
been transacted by a party at an occasional meeting, and
not by general consent; and by a solemn act they declared
their attachment to the Queen and the protestant succession.
The court was satisfied with this atonement; but the re∣sident
from Hanover having presented a memorial to the
Queen, desiring that Dundass and his associates might be
prosecuted, the government removed Sir David Dalrymp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="197" REF="203"/>
from his office of lord advocate, on pretence of his having
been too remiss in prosecuting those delinquents; and no
further enquiry was made into the affair.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. For some time a negociation for peace had
been carried on between the court of France and the new
ministers, who had a double aim in this measure; namely,
to mortify the Whigs and the Dutch, whom they de∣tested,
and to free their country from a ruinous war, which
had all the appearance of becoming habitual to the con∣stitution.
They foresaw the risque they would run by
entering into such measures, should ever the opposite
faction regain the ascendancy; they knew the Whigs
would employ all their art and influence, which was very
powerful, in obstructing the peace, and in raising a popu∣lar
clamour against the treaty. But their motives for
treating were such as prompted them to undervalue all
those difficulties and dangers. They hoped to obtain such
advantages in point of commerce for the subjects of
Great-Britain, as would silence all detraction. They
did not doubt of being able to maintain the superiority
which they had acquired in parliament; and perhaps some
of them cherished views in favour of the Pretender, whose
succession to the crown would have effectually established
their dominion over the opposite party. The Earl of
Jersey, who acted in concert with Oxford, sent a private
message to the court of France, importing the Queen's
earnest desire of peace, representing the impossibility of a
private negociation, as the ministry was obliged to act with
the utmost circumspection, and desiring that Louis would
propose to the Dutch a renewal of the conferences, in
which case the English plenipotentiaries should have such
instructions, that it would be impossible for the States-General
to prevent the conclusion of the treaty. This
intimation was delivered by one Gualtier, an obscure priest,
who acted as chaplain to Count Gallas, the Imperial am∣bassador,
and had been employed as a spy by the French
ministry, since the commencement of hostilities. His
connexion with Lord Jersey was by means of that noble∣man's
<PB N="198" REF="204"/>
lady, who professed the Roman Catholick religion.
His message was extremely agreeable to the court of Ver∣sailles.
He returned to London, with a letter of compli∣ment
from the Marquis de Torcy to the Earl of Jersey,
in which that minister assured him of his master's sincere
inclination for peace, though he was averse to a renewal
of the conferences with the States-General. Gualtier
wrote a letter to Versailles, desiring, in the name of the
English ministry, that his Most Christian Majesty would
communicate to them his proposals for a general peace,
which they would communicate to the States-General,
that they might negociate in concert with their allies.
A general answer being made to this intimation, Gualtier
made a second journey to Versailles, and brought over a
memorial, which was immediately transmitted to Holland.
In the mean time, the Pensionary endeavoured to renew
the conferences in Holland. Petkum wrote to the French
ministry, that if his Majesty would resume the negociation,
in concert with the Queen of Great-Britain, he should
certainly have reason to be satisfied with the conduct of the
Dutch deputies. This proposal Louis declined, at the
desire of the English ministers.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. The States-General having perused the
memorial, assured Queen Anne that they were ready to
join with her in contributing to the conclusion of a dura∣ble
peace: but they expressed a desire that the French
King would communicate a more particular plan for se∣curing
the interest of the allied powers, and for settling
the repose of Europe. Gualtier was once more sent to
Versailles, accompanied by Mr. Prior, who had resided
in France, as secretary to the embassies of the Earls of
Portland and Jersey. This gentleman had acquired some
reputation by his poetial talents; was a man of uncom∣mon
ability, insinuating address, and perfectly devoted to
the Tory interest. He was empowered to communicate
the preliminary demands of the English; to receive the
answer of the French King; and demand whether or not
King Philip had transmitted a power of treating to his
<PB N="199" REF="205"/>
grandfather. He arrived incognito at Fontainebleau, and
presented the Queen's memorial, in which she demanded
a barrier for the Dutch in the Netherlands, and another
on the Rhine for the empire; a security for the Dutch
commerce, and a general satisfaction to all her allies.
She required that the strong places taken from the Duke
of Savoy should be restored; and that he should possess
such towns and districts in Italy as had been ceded to him
in treaties between him and his allies: that Louis should
acknowledge Queen Anne and the protestant succession;
demolish the fortifications of Dunkirk; and agree to a
new treaty of commerce: that Gibralter and Port-Mahon
should be yielded to the crown of England: that the negro
trade in America, at that time carried on by the French,
should be ceded to the English, together with some towns
on that continent, where the slaves might be refreshed.
She expected security that her subjects trading to Spain
should enjoy all advantages granted by that crown to the
most favoured nation: that she should be put in possession
of Newfoundland and Hudson's-Bay, either by way of
restitution or cession; and that both nations should con∣tinue
to enjoy whatever territories they might be possessed
of in North-America at the ratification of the treaties.
She likewise insisted upon a security that the crowns
of France and Spain should never be united on the
same head. Her Majesty no longer insisted upon
Philip's being expelled from the throne of Spain by the
arms of his own grandfather. She now perceived that
the exorbitant power of the house of Austria would be as
dangerous to the liberty of Europe, as ever that of the
family of Bourbon had been, in the zenith of its glory.
She might have remembered the excessive power, the in∣solence,
the ambition of Charles V. and Philip II. who
had enslaved so many countries, and embroiled all Europe.
She was sincrely desirous of peace, from motives of hu∣manity
and compassion to her subjects and fellow-creatures:
she was eagerly bent upon procuring such advantages to
<PB N="200" REF="206"/>
her people, as would enable them to discharge the heavy
load of debt under which they laboured, and recompense
them in some measure for the blood and treasure they had
so lavishly expended in the prosecution of the war. These
were the sentiments of a Christian princess; of an ami∣able
and pious sovereign, who bore a share in the griev∣ances
of her subjects, and looked upon them with the
eyes of maternal affection. She thought she had the better
title to insist upon those advantages, as they had been
already granted to her subjects in a private treaty with
King Charles.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. As Prior's powers were limited in such
a manner that he could not negociate, Mr. Menager,
deputy from the city of Rouen to the Board of Trade, ac∣companied
the English minister to London, with full
powers to settle the preliminaries of the treaty. On his
arrival in London, the Queen immediately commissioned
the Duke of Shrewsbury, the Earls of Jersey, Dartmouth,
Oxford, and Mr. St. John, to treat with him; and the
conferences were immediately begun. After long and
various disputes, they agreed upon certain prelimary
articles, which, on the eighth day of October, were signed
by the French minister, and by the two secretaries of state,
in consequence of a written order from her Majesty. Then
Menager was privately introduced to the Queen at Wind∣sor.
She told him she was averse to war: that she would
exert all her power to conclude a speedy peace: that she
should be glad to live upon good terms with the King of
France, to whom she was so nearly allied in blood: she
expressed her hope that there would be a closer union after
the peace between them, and between their subjects, ce∣mented
by a perfect correspondence and friendship. The
Earl of Strafford, who had been lately recalled from the
Hague, where he resided as ambassador, was now sent back
to Holland, with orders to communicate to the Pensionary
the proposals of peace which France had made; to signify
the Queen's approbation of them, and propose a place
where the plenipotentiaries should assemble. The English
<PB N="201" REF="207"/>
ministers now engaged in an intimate correspondence with
the court of Versailles; and Mareschal Tallard being re∣leased
from his confinement at Nottingham, was allowed
to return to his own country on his parole. After the de∣parture
of Menager, the preliminaries were communi∣cated
to Count Gallas, the Emperor's minister, who, in
order to inflame the minds of the people, caused them to
be translated, and inserted in one of the daily papers. This
step was so much resented by the Queen, that she sent a
message, desiring he would come no more to court; but
that he might leave the kingdom as soon as he should think
proper. He took the hint, and retired accordingly; but
the Queen gave the Emperor to understand, that any
other minister he should appoint would be admitted by her
without hesitation.</P>
<P>§ XXXVI. The States of Holland, alarmed at the
preliminaries, sent over Buys, as envoy extraordinary, to
intercede with the Queen, that she would alter her reso∣lutions;
but she continued steady to her purpose; and the
Earl of Strafford demanded the immediate concurrence of
the States, declaring, in the Queen's name, that she
would look upon any delay, on their part, as a refusal to
comply with her propositions. Intimidated by this decla∣ration,
they agreed to open the general conferences at
Utrecht on the first day of January. They granted pass∣ports
to the French ministers; while the Queen appointed
Robinson Bishop of Bristol, and the Earl of Strafford,
her plenipotentiaries at the congress. Charles, the new
Emperor, being at Milan when he received a copy of the
preliminaries, wrote circular letters to the Electors and
the princes of the empire, exhorting them to persist in their
engagements to the grand alliance. He likewise desired
the States-General to join councils with him in per∣suading
the Queen of England to reject the proposals of
France, and prosecute the war; or at least to negociate
on the foundation of the first preliminaries, which had
been signed by the Marquis de Torey. He wrote a letter
to the same purpose to the Queen of Great-Britain, who
<PB N="202" REF="208"/>
received it with the most mortifying indifference. No
wonder that he should zealously contend for the con∣tinuance
of a war, the expense of which she and the Dutch
had hitherto almost wholly defrayed. The new prelimi∣naries
were severely attacked by the Whigs, who ridi∣culed
and reviled the ministry in word and writing. Pam∣phlets,
libels, and lampoons were to-day published by one
faction, and to-morrow answered by the other. They
contained all the insinuations of malice and contempt, all
the bitterness of reproach, and all the rancour of recrimi∣nation.
In the midst of this contention, the Queen dis∣patched
the Earl of Rivers to Hanover, with an assurance
to the Elector, that his succession to the crown should be
effectually ascertained in the treaty. The Earl brought
back an answer in writing: but, at the same time, his
electoral highness ordered the Baron de Bothmar, his en∣voy
in England, to present a memorial to the Queen,
representing the pernicious consequences of Philip's re∣maining
in possession of Spain and the West-Indies.
This remonstrance the Baron published, by way of appeal
to the people, and the Whigs extolled it with the highest
encomiums; but the Queen and her ministers resented this
step, as an officious and inflammatory interposition.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. The proposals of peace made by the French
King were disagreeable even to some individuals of the
Tory party, and certain peers, who had hitherto adhered
to that interest, agreed with the Whigs, to make a re∣monstrance
against the preliminary articles. The court
being apprised of their intention, prorogued the parliament
till the seventh day of December, in expectation of the
Scottish peers, who would cast the balance in favour of
the ministry. In her speech, at the opening of the session,
she told them that, notwithstanding the arts of those who
delighted in war, the place and time were appointed for a
congress; and that the States-General had expressed their
entire confidence in her conduct. She declared her chief
concern should be to secure the succession of the crown in
the House of Hanover; to procure all the advantages to
<PB N="203" REF="209"/>
the nation which a tender and affectionate sovereign could
procure for a dutiful and loyal people; and to obtain satis∣faction
for all her allies. She observed, that the most
effectual way to procure an advantageous peace would
be to make preparations for carrying on the war with
vigour. She recommended unanimity, and prayed God
would direct their consultations. In the House of Lords,
the Earl of Nottingham, who had now associated himself
with the Whigs, inveighed against the preliminaries as
captious and insufficient, and offered a clause to be in∣serted
in the address of thanks, representing to her Ma∣jesty,
that, in the opinion of the House, no peace could
be safe or honourable to Great-Britain or Europe, if Spain
and the West-Indies should be allotted to any branch of
the House of Bourbon. A violent debate ensued, in the
course of which the Earl of Anglesey represented the ne∣cessity
of easing the nation of the burthens incurred by an
expensive war. He affirmed that a good peace might
have been procured immediately after the battle of Ramil∣lies,
if it had not been prevented by some persons who
prolonged the war for their own private interest. This
insinuation was levelled at the Duke of Marlborough, who
made a long speech in his own vindication. He bowed to
the place where the Queen sat incognito; and appealed
to her, whether, while he had the honour to serve her
Majesty as general and plenipotentiary, he had not constant∣ly
informed her and her council of all the proposals of
peace which had been made; and had not desired instruc∣tions
for his conduct on that subject? He declared, upon
his conscience, and in presence of the Supreme Being,
before whom he expected soon to appear, that he was
ever desirous of a safe, honourable, and lasting peace; and
that he was always very far from entertaining any design
of prolonging the war for his own private advantage, as
his enemies had most falsely insinuated. At last the
question being put, Whether the Earl of Nottingham's
advice should be part of the address? it was carried in
the affirmative by a small majority. The address was
<PB N="204" REF="210"/>
accordingly presented; and the Queen, in her answer, said
she should be very sorry any one could think she would
not do her utmost to recover Spain and the West-Indies
from the House of Bourbon. Against this advice, how∣ever,
several peers protested, because there was no prece∣dent
for inserting a clause of advice in an address of thanks;
and because they looked upon it as an invasion of the
royal prerogative. In the address of the Commons there
was no such article; and, therefore, the answer they re∣ceived
was warm and cordial.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. The Duke of Hamilton claiming a seat in
the House of Peers, as Duke of Brandon, a title he had
lately received, was opposed by the anti-courtiers, who
pretended to foresee great danger to the constitution from
admitting into the House a greater number of Scottish
peers than the act of Union allowed. Counsel was heard
upon the validity of his patent. They observed that no
objection could be made to the Queen's prerogative in con∣ferring
honours; and that all the subjects of the united
kingdom were equally capable of receiving honour. The
House of Lords had already decided the matter, in ad∣mitting
the Duke of Queensberry upon his being created
Duke of Dover. The debate was managed with great
ability on both sides: the Scottish peers united in defence
of the Duke's claim; and the court exerted its whole
strength to support the patent. Nevertheless, the question
being put, Whether Scottish peers, created peers of Great-Britain
since the Union, had a right to sit in that House?
it was carried in the negative by a majority of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive voices;
though not without a protest signed by the lords in the
opposition. The Scottish peers were so incensed at this
decision, that they drew up a representation to the Queen,
complaining of it as an infringement of the Union, and a
mark of disgrace put upon the whole peerage of Scotland.
The bill against occasional conformity was revived by
the Earl of Nottingham, in more moderate terms than
those that had been formerly rejected; and it passed both
<PB N="205" REF="211"/>
Houses by the connivance of the Whigs, upon the Earl's
promise, that if they would consent to this measure, he
would bring over many friends to join them in matters of
greater consequence. On the twenty-second day of De∣cember,
the Queen being indisposed, granted a commission
to the Lord-Keeper, and some other peers, to give the
royal assent to this bill, and another for the land-tax.
The Duke of Devonshire obtained leave to bring in a bill
for giving precedence of all peers to the Electoral Prince
of Hanover, as Duke of Cambridge. An address was pre∣sented
to the Queen, desiring she would give instructions
to her plenipotentiaries, to consult with the ministers of
the allies in Holland before the opening of the congress;
that they might concert the necessary measures for pro∣ceeding
with unanimity, the better to obtain the great ends
proposed by her Majesty.</P>
<P>§ XXXIX. The commissioners for examining the pub∣lick
accounts having discovered that the Duke of Marl∣borough
had received an annual present of five or six
thousand pounds from the contractors for bread to the
army, the Queen declared in council, that she thought fit
to dismiss him from all his employments, that the matter
might be impartially examined. This declaration was im∣parted
to him in a letter under her own hand, in which
she took occasion to complain of the treatment she had
received. She probably alluded to the insolence of his
duchess; the subjection in which she had been kept by
the late ministry; and the pains lately taken by the Whigs
to depreciate her conduct, and thwart her measures with
respect to the peace. The Duke wrote an answer to her
Majesty, vindicating himself from the charge which had
been brought against his character; and his two daugh∣ters,
the Countess of Sunderland and the Lady Rialton,
resigned their places of ladies of the bed-chamber. The
ministry, in order to ascertain a majority in the House of
Lords, persuaded the Queen to take a measure which no∣thing
but necessary could justify. She created twelve
<PB N="206" REF="212"/>
peers at once<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Compton and Lord Bruce, sons of the Earls of Northampton and Aylesbury, were called up by writ to the House of Peers. The other ten were these: Lord Duplin, of the kingdom of Scotland, created Baron Hay of Bedwardin, in the county of Hereford; Lord Viscount Windsor, of Ireland, made Baron Mountjoy, in the Isle of Wight; Henry Paget, son of Lord Paget, created Baron Burton in the county of Stafford; Sir Thomas Mansel, Baron Mansel, of Margam, in the county of Glamorgan; Sir Thomas Wil∣loughby, Baron Middleton, of Middleton, in the county of Warwick; Sir Thomas Trevor, Baron Trevor, of Bromham, in the county of Bedford; George Granville, Baron Landsdown, of Biddeford, in the county of Devon; Samuel Masham, Baron Masham, of Oats, in the county of Essex; Thomas Foley, Baron Foley, of Kidderminster, in the county of Worcester; and Allen Bathurst, Baron Bathurst, of Bathelsden, in the county of Bedford.—On the first day of their being introduced, when the question was put about ad∣journing, the Earl of Wharton asked one of them, “Whether they voted by their foreman?”</NOTE> and on the second of January they were
introduced into the Upper-House without opposition.
The Lord-Keeper delivered to the House a message from
the Queen, desiring they would adjourn to the fourteenth
day of the month. The anti-courtiers alledged that the
Queen could not send a message to any one House to ad∣journ,
but ought to have directed it to both Houses. This
objection produced a debate, which was terminated in fa∣vour
of the court by the weight of the twelve new peers.</P>
<P>§ XL. At this period Prince Eugene arrived in England,
with a letter to the Queen from the Emperor, and in∣structions
to propose a new scheme for prosecuting the
war. His errand was far from being agreeable to the mi∣nistry;
and they suspected that his real aim was to manage
intrigues among the discontented party, who opposed the
peace. Nevertheless, he was treated with that respect
which was due to his quality and eminent talents. The
ministers, the nobility, and officers of distinction visited
him at his arrival. He was admitted to an audience of
the Queen, who received him with great complacency.
Having perused the letter which he delivered, she ex∣pressed
her concern that her health did not permit her to
speak with his Highness as often as she could wish; but
that she had ordered the Treasurer and Secretary St. John
to receive his proposals, and confer with him as fre∣quently
<PB N="207" REF="213"/>
as he should think proper. He expressed extra∣ordinary
respect for the Duke of Marlborough, notwith∣standing
his disgrace. The Lord-Treasurer, while he
entertained him at dinner, declared that he looked upon
that day as the happiest in the whole course of his life,
since he had the honour to see in his house the greatest
captain of the age. The Prince is said to have replied,
“If I am, it is owing to your lordship.” Alluding to the
disgrace of Marlborough, whom the Earl's intrigues had
deprived of all military command. When Bishop Bur∣net
conversed with him about the scandalous libels that
were every day published against the Duke, and in par∣ticular
mentioned one paragraph, in which the author
allowed he had been once fortunate, the Prince observed
it was greatest commendation that could be bestowed
upon him, as it implied that all his other successes were
owing to his courage and conduct. While the nobility of
both parties vied with each other in demonstrations of re∣spect
for this noble stranger; while he was adored by the
Whigs, and admired by the people, who gazed at him in
crouds when he appeared in publick; even in the midst of
all these caresses, party riots were excited to insult his per∣son,
and some scandalous reflexions upon his mother were
inserted in one of the publick papers. The Queen treated
him with distinguished marks of regard; and, on her
birth-day, presented him with a sword worth five thousand
pounds. Nevertheless, she looked upon him as a patron
and friend of that turbulent faction to which she owed so
much disquiet. She knew he had been pressed to come
over by the Whig-noblemen, who hoped his presence
would inflame the people to some desperate attempt upon
the new ministry: she was not ignorant that he held pri∣vate
conferences with the Duke of Marlborough, the
Earl of Sunderland, the Lords Somers, Hallifax, and all
the chiefs of that party; and that he entered into a close
connection with the Baron de Bothmar, the Hanover<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
envoy, who had been very active in something the distur∣bances
of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="214"/>
§ XLI. Her Majesty, who had been for some time
afflicted with the gout, sent a message to both Houses, on
the seventeenth day of January, signifying that the pleni∣potentiaries
were arrived at Utrecht; and that she was
employed in making preparations for an early campaign:
she hoped, therefore, that the Commons would proceed in
giving the necessary dispatch to the supplies. The Lord-Treasurer,
in order to demonstrate his attachment to the
protestant succession, brought in a bill which had been
proposed by the Duke of Devonshire, giving precedence to
the whole electoral family, as children and nephews of the
crown; and, when it was passed into an act, he sent it
over to Hanover by Mr. Thomas Harley. The sixteen
peers for Scotland were prevailed upon, by promise of
satisfaction, to resume their seats in the Upper House, from
which they had absented themselves since the decision
against the patent of the Duke of Hamilton: but what∣ever
pecuniary recompense they might have obtained from
the court, on which they were meanly dependent, they
received no satisfaction from the parliament. The Com∣mons
finding Mr. Walpole very troublesome in their House,
by his talents, activity, and zealous attachment to the
Whig interest, found means to discover some clandestine
practices in which he was concerned as secretary at war,
with regard to the forage-contract in Scotland. The
contractors, rather than admit into their partnership a
person whom he had recommended for that purpose, chose
to present his friend with five hundred pounds. Their
bill was addressed to Mr. Walpole, who endorsed it, and
his friend touched the money<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The commissioners appointed for taking, stating, and examining the pub∣lick accounts having made their report touching the conduct of Mr. Wal∣pole, the House, after a long debate, came to the following resolutions: 1. That Robert Walpole, Esq. a member of this House, in receiving the sum of five hundred guineas, and in taking a note for five hundred more, on account of two contracts for forage of her Majesty's troops, quartered in North Bri∣tain, made by him when secretary at war, pursuant to a power granted to him by the late Lord-Treasurer, is guilty of a high breach of trust and noto∣rious corruption. 2. That the said Robert Walpole, Esq. be for the said of∣fense committed prisoner to the Tower of London, during the pleasure of this House; and that Mr. Speaker do issue his warrant accordingly. 3. That the said Robert Walpole, Esq. be for the said offense also expelled the House, and that the report of the commissioners of publick accounts be taken into further consideration that day se'nnight.—It appeared from the depositions of witnesses that the publick had been defrauded considerably by the contracts—a very severe speech was made in the House, and next day published, reflecting upon Mr. Walpole, as guilty of the worst kind of corruption; and Sir Peter King declared in the House, that he deserved hanging as well as he deserved imprisonment and expulsion.</NOTE>. This transaction was
<PB N="209" REF="215"/>
interpreted into a bribe. Mr. Walpole was voted guilty
of corruption, imprisoned in the Tower, and expelled the
House. Being afterwards rechosen by the same borough of
Lynn-Regis, which he had before represented, a petition
was lodged against him, and the Commons voted him in∣capable
of being elected a member to serve in the present
parliament.</P>
<P>§ XLII. Their next attack was upon the Duke of Marl∣borough,
who was found to have received a yearly sum
from Sir Solomon Medina, a Jew, concerned in the con∣tract
for furnishing the army with bread; to have been
gratified by the Queen with ten thousand pounds a year
to defray the expense of intelligence; and to have pocket∣ed
a deduction of two and a half per cent. from the pay
of the foreign troops maintained by England. It was
alledged, in his justification, that the present from the
Jews was a customary perquisite, which had always been
enjoyed by the general of the Dutch army: that the de∣duction
of two and a half per cent. was granted to him by
an express warrant from her Majesty: that all the articles
of the charge joined together did not exceed thirty thou∣sand
pounds, a sum which inferior to that which had been
allowed to King William for contingencies: that the
money was expended in procuring intelligence, which was
so exact that the Duke was never surprised: that none of
his parties were ever intercepted or cut off; and all his
designs were by these means so well concerted, that he never
once miscarried. Notwithstanding these representations
the majority voted that his practices had been unwarrant∣able
<PB N="210" REF="216"/>
and illegal; and that the deduction was to be account∣ed
for as publick money. These resolutions were com∣municated
to the Queen, who ordered the Attorney-Gene∣ral
to prosecute the Duke for the money he had deducted
by virtue of her own warrant. Such practices were cer∣tainly
mean and mercenary, and greatly tarnished the glory
which the Duke had acquired by his military talents, and
other shining qualities.</P>
<P>§ XLIII. The Commons now directed the streams of
their resentment against the Dutch, who had certainly
exerted all their endeavours to overwhelm the new mini∣stry,
and retard the negociations for peace. They main∣tained
an intimate correspondence with the Whigs of Eng∣land.
They diffused the most invidious reports against
Oxford and Secretary St. John. Buys, their envoy at
London, acted the part of an incendiary, in suggesting
violent measures to the malcontents, and caballing against
the government. The ministers, by way of reprisal, in∣fluenced
the House of Commons to pass some acrimonious
resolutions against the States-General. They alledged
that the States had been deficient in their proportion of
troops, both in Spain and in the Netherlands, during the
whole course of the war; and that the Queen had paid
above three millions of crowns in subsidies, above what
she was obliged to advance by her engagements. They
attacked the barrier treaty, which had been concluded
with the States by Lord Townshend, after the confer∣ences
at Gertruydenberg. By this agreement, England
guaranteed a barrier in the Netherlands to the Dutch:
and the States bound themselves to maintain, with their
whole force, the Queen's title, and the protestant suc∣cession.
The Tories affirmed that England was disgraced
by engaging any other state to defend a succession which
the nation might see cause to alter: that, by this treaty,
the States were authorised to interpose in British councils
that being possessed of all those strong towns, they might
exclude the English from trading to them, and interfere
with the manufactures of Great-Britain. The House of
<PB N="211" REF="217"/>
Commons voted, That in the barrier treaty there were
several articles destructive to the trade and interest of
Great-Britain; and therefore highly dishonourable to her
Majesty: That the Lord Viscount Townshend was not
authorised to conclude several articles in that treaty:
That he and all those who had advised its being ratified
were enemies to the Queen and kingdom. All their votes
were digested into a long representation presented to the
Queen, in which they averred that England, during the war,
had been overcharged nineteen millions; a circumstance
that implied mismanagement or fraud in the old ministry.
The States, alarmed at these resolutions, wrote a respect∣ful
letter to the Queen, representing the necessity of a
barrier, for the mutual security of England and the United
Provinces. They afterwards drew up a large memorial
in vindication of their proceedings during the war; and
it was published in one of the English papers. The Com∣mons
immediately voted it a false, scandalous, and ma∣licious
libel, reflecting upon the resolutions of the House;
and the printer the publisher were taken into custody, as
guilty of a breach of privilege.</P>
<P>§ XLIV. They now repealed the naturalization act.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE>
They passed a bill granting a toleration to the episco∣pal

that they might be upon an equal footing in
case of disobedience; for the Commons well knew that
this condition would be rejected by both, from very differ∣ent
motives. In order to exasperate the presbyterians
with further provocations, another act was passed for dis∣continuing
the courts of judicature during the Christmas
<PB N="212" REF="218"/>
holidays, which had never been kept by persons of that
persuasions. When this bill was read for the third time,
Sir David Dalrymple said, “Since the House is resolved
to make no alteration in the body of this bill, I acqui∣esee;
and only desire it may be intituled, A bill for
establishing jacobitism and immorality.” The chagrin
of the Scottish presbyterians was completed by a third
bill, restoring the right of patronage, which had been
taken away when the discipline of the kirk was last esta∣blished.
Prince Eugene having presented a memorial to
the Queen, touching the conduct of the Emperor during
the war, and containg a proposal with relation to the
affairs of Spain, the Queen communicated the scheme to
the House of Commons, who treated it with the most con∣temptuous
neglect. The Prince, finding all his efforts in∣effectual,
retired to the continent, as much displeased with
the ministry, as he had reason to be satisfied with the peo∣ple
of England. The Commons having settled the funds
for the supplies of the year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1712.</NOTE> amounting to six millions;
the Treasurer formed the plan of a bill appointing commis∣sioners
to examine the value and consideration of all the
grants made since the Revolution. His design was to make
a general resumption; but, as the interest of so many
noblemen was concerned, the bill met with a very warm
opposition; notwithstanding which, it would have cer∣tainly
passed, had not the Duke of Buckingham and the
Earl of Strafford absented themselves from the House
during the debate.</P>

<PB N="214" REF="220"/>
<P>§ 1. IN the month of January the conferences for peace
began at Utrecht.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1712.</NOTE> The Earl of Jersey would
have been appointed the plenipotentiary for England, but
he dying after the correspondence with the court of France
was established, the Queen conferred that charge upon
Robinson, Bishop of Bristol, Lord Privy-Seal, and the
Earl of Strafford. The chief of the Dutch deputies named
for the congress, were Buys and Vanderdussen: the French
King granted his powers to the Mareschal D'Uxelles,
the Abbot (afterwards Cardinal) de Polignac, and Mena∣ger,
who had been in England. The ministers of the Em∣peror
and Savoy likewise assisted at the conferences, to
which the empire and the other allies likewise sent their,
plenipotentiaries, though not without reluctance. As all
these powers, except France, entertained sentiments very
different from those of her Britannick Majesty, the con∣ferences
seemed calculated rather to retard than accelerate
a pacification. The Queen of England had foreseen and
<PB N="215" REF="221"/>
provided against these difficulties.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XI. 1712.</NOTE> Her great end was to
free her subjects from the miseries attending an unprofit∣able
war, and to restore peace to Europe; and this aim
she was resolved to accomplish, in spite of all opposition.
She had also determined to procure reasonable terms of ac∣commodation
for her allies, without, however, continuing
to lavish the blood and treasure of her people in supporting
their extravagant demands. The Emperor obstinately in∣sisted
upon his claim to the whole Spanish monarchy, re∣fusing
to give up the least tittle of his pretensions; and
the Dutch adhered to the old preliminaries which Louis
had formerly rejected. The Queen saw that the liberties
of Europe would be exposed to much greater danger from
an actual union of the Imperial and Spanish crowns in
one head of the house of Austria, than from a bare
possibility of Spain's being united with France in one
branch of the House of Bourbon. She knew by ex∣perience
the difficulty of dethroning Philip, rooted as
he was in the affections of a brave and loyal people;
and that a prosecution of this design would serve no pur∣pose
but to protract the war, and augment the griev∣ances
of the British nation. She was well acquainted
with the distresses of the French, which she considered
as pledges of their monarch's sincerity. She sought not
the total ruin of that people, already reduced to the brink
of despair. The dictates of true policy dissuaded her from
contributing to further conquests in that kingdom, which
would have proved the source of contention among the
allies, depressed the House of Bourbon below that stan∣dard
of importance which the balance of Europe required
it should maintain, and aggrandize the States-General at
the expense of Great-Britain. As she had bor'n the chief
burthen of the war, she had a right to take the lead; and
dictate a plan of pacification: at least, she had a right to
consult the welfare of her own kingdom, in delivering,
by a separate peace, her subjects from those enormous loads
which they could no longer sustain; and she was well
<PB N="216" REF="222"/>
enough aware of her own consequence, to think she could
obtain advantageous conditions.</P>
<P>§ II. Such were the sentiments of the Queen; and her
ministers seem to have acted on the same principles, though,
perhaps, party motives may have helped to influence their
conduct. The allies concurred in opposing with all their
might any treaty which could not gratify their different
views of avarice, interest, and ambition. They practised
a thousand little artifices to intimidate the Queen, to ex∣cite
a jealousy of Louis, to blacken the characters of her
ministers, to raise and keep up a dangerous ferment among
her people, by which her life and government were en∣dangered.
She could not fail to resent these efforts, which
greatly perplexed her measures, and obstructed her design.
Her ministers were sensible of the dangerous predicament
in which they stood. The Queen's health was much im∣paired; and the successor countenanced the opposite sac∣tion.
In case of their sovereign's death they had nothing
to expect but prosecution and ruin for obeying her com∣mands:
they saw no hope of safety, except in renouncing
their principles, and submitting to their adversaries, or else
in taking such measures as would hasten the pacification,
that the troubles of the kingdom might be appeased, and the
people be satisfied with their conduct before death should
deprive them of their sovereign's protection. With this
view they advised her to set on foot a private negociation
with Louis; to stipulate certain advantages for her own
subjects in a concerted plan of peace; to enter into such
mutual confidence with that monarch, as would anticipate
all clandestine transactions to her prejudice, and in some
measure enable her prescribe terms for her to allies. The
plan was judiciously formed: but executed with too much
precipitation. The stipulated advantages were not such
as she had a right to demand and insist upon; and with∣out
all doubt, better might have been obtained, had not
the obstinacy of the allies abroad, and the violent conduct
of the Whig faction at home, obliged the ministers to
<PB N="217" REF="223"/>
relax in some material points, and hasten the conclusion of
the treaty.</P>
<P>§ III. The articles being privately regulated between the
two courts of London and Versailles, the English plenipo∣tentiaries
at Utrecht were furnished with general powers
and instructions, being ignorant of the agreement which
the Queen had made with the French monarch, touching
the kingdom of Spain, which was indeed the basis of the
treaty. This secret plan of negociation, however, had
well nigh been destroyed by some unforeseen events that
were doubly afflicting to Louis. The Dauphin had died
of the small-pox in the course of the preceding year, and
his title had been conserred upon his son, the Duke of
Burgundy, who now expired on the last day of February,
six days after the death of his wife, Mary Adelaide of
Savoy. The parents were soon followed to the grave by
their eldest offspring, the Duke of Bretagne, in the sixth
year of his age; so that of the Duke of Burgundy's chil∣dren,
none remained alive but the Duke of Anjou, the
late French king, who was at that time a sickly infant.
Such a series of calamities could not fail of being extremely
shocking to Louis in his old age; but they were still more
alarming to the Queen of England, who saw that nothing
but the precarious life of an unhealthy child divided the
two monarchies of France and Spain, the union of which
she resolved by all possible means to prevent. She, there∣fore,
sent the Abbé Gualtier to Paris, with a memorial,
representing the danger to which the liberty of Europe
would be exposed, should Philip ascend the throne of
France; and demanding, that his title should be trans∣ferred
to his brother, the Duke of Berry, in consequence of
his pure, simple, and voluntary renunciation.</P>
<P>§ IV. Mean while the French plenipotentiaries at
Utrecht were prevailed upon to deliver their proposals
in writing, under the name of specifick offers, which the allies
received with indignation. They were treated in England
with universal scorn. Lord Hallifax, in the House of
Peers, termed them trifling, arrogant, and injurious to her
<PB N="218" REF="224"/>
Majesty and her allies: an address was presented to the
Queen, in which they expressed their resentment against
the insolence of France, and promised to assist her with all
their power in prosecuting the war, until a safe and ho∣nourable
peace should be obtained. The plenipotentiaries
of the allies were not less extravagant in their specifick de∣mands
than the French had been arrogant in their offers.
In a word, the ministers seemed to have been assembled
at Utrecht, rather to start new difficulties, and widen the
breach, than to heal animosities, and concert a plan of
pacification. They amused one another with fruitless
conferences, while the Queen of Great-Britain endeavoured
to engage the States-General in her measures, that they
might treat with France upon moderate terms, and give
law to the rest of the allies. She departed from some of
her own pretensions, in order to gratify them with the
possession of some towns in Flanders. She consented to
their being admitted into a participation of some advan∣tages
in commerce; and ordered the English ministers at
the congress to tell them, that she would take her measures
according to the return they should make on this occa∣sion.
Finding them still obstinately attached to their first
chimerical preliminaries, she gave them to understand, that
all her offers for adjusting the differences were founded
upon the express condition, That they should come into
her measures, and co-operate with her openly and sin∣cerely:
but they had made such bad returns to all her
condescension towards them, that she looked upon herself
as released from all engagements. The ministers of the
allies had insisted upon a written answer to their specifick
demands; and this the French plenipotentiaries declined,
until they should receive fresh instructions from their ma∣ster.
Such was the pretence for suspending the confer∣ences:
but the real bar to a final agreement between
England and France, was the delay of Philip's renunciation,
which at length, however, arrived; and produced a cessation
of arms.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="225"/>
§ V. In the mean time the Duke of Ormond, who was
now invested with the supreme command of the British
forces, received a particular order, that he should not
hazard an engagement. Louis had already undertaken
for the compliance of his grandson. Reflecting on his own
great age, he was shocked at the prospect of leaving his
kingdom involved in a pernicious war during a minority;
and determined to procure a peace at all events. The
Queen, knowing his motives, could not help believing his
protestations, and resolved to avoid a battle, the issue of
which might have considerably altered the situation of
affairs, and consequently retarded the conclusion of the
treaty. Preparations had been made for an early campaign.
In the beginning of March, the Earl of Albemarle, having
assembled a body of thirty-six battalions, marched towards
Arras, which he reduced to a heap of ashes by a most ter∣rible
cannonading and bombardment. In May, the Duke
of Ormond conferred with the deputies of the States-Ge∣neral
at the Hague, and assured them that he had orders
to act vigorously in the prosecution of the war. He
joined Prince Eugene at Tournay; and, on the twenty-sixth
day of May, the allied army, passing the Schelde, en∣camped
at Haspre and Solemnes. The Imperial general
proposed that they should attack the French army under
Villars: but by this time the Duke was restrained from
hazarding siege or battle: a circumstance well known to
the French commander, who therefore abated of his usual
vigilance. It could not be long concealed from Prince
Eugene and the deputies, who forthwith dispatched an
express to their principals on this subject, and afterwards
presented a long memorial to the Duke, representing the
injury which the grand alliance would sustain from his
obedience of such an order. He seemed to be extremely
uneasy at his situation; and, in a letter to Secretary St.
John, expressed a desire that the Queen would permit him
to return to England.</P>
<P>§ VI. Prince Eugene, notwithstanding the Queen's
order, which Ormond had not yet formally declared,
<PB N="220" REF="226"/>
invested the town of Quesnoy, and the Duke furnished to∣wards
this enterprise seven battalions and nine squadrons
of the foreign troops maintained by Great-Britain. The
Dutch deputies at Utrecht expostulating with the Bishop
of Bristol upon the Duke's refusing to act against the
enemy, that prelate told them, that he had lately received
an express, with a letter from her Majesty, in which she
complained, that as the States-General had not properly
answered her advances, they ought not to be surprised, if
she thought herself at liberty to enter into separate mea∣sures,
in order to obtain a peace for her own conveniency.
When they remonstrated against such conduct, as contra∣dictory
to all the alliances subsisting between the Queen
and the States-General, the Bishop declared his instruc∣tions
further imported, that considering the conduct of the
States towards her Majesty, she thought herself disengaged
from all alliances and engagements with their High-Mighti∣nesses.
The States and the ministers of the allies were in∣stantly
in commotion. Private measures were concerted
with the Elector of Hanover, the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel,
and some other princes of the empire, concerning
the troops belonging to those powers in the pay of Great-Britain.
The States General wrote a long letter to the
Queen, and ordered their envoy at London to deliver it
into her own hand. Count Zinzendorf, the Emperor's
plenipotentiary, dispatched expresses to his master, to
Prince Eugene, and to the Imperial ambassador at Lon∣don.
The Queen had a council at Kensington upon the
subject of the letter; and a fresh order was sent to the
Duke of Ormond, directing him to concur with the general
of the allies in a siege.</P>
<P>§ VII. On the twenty-eighth day of May, Lord Halli∣fax,
in the House of Peers, descanted upon the ill conse∣quences
of the Duke's refusing to co-operate with Prince
Eugene; and moved for an address, desiring her Majesty
would order the General to act offensively, in concert with
her allies. The Treasurer observed it was the prudent to avoid
a battle on the eve of a peace, especially considering they
<PB N="221" REF="227"/>
had to do with an enemy so apt to break his word. The
Earl of Wharton replied, this was a strong reason for
keeping no measures with such an enemy. When Ox∣ford
declared, that the Duke of Ormond had received
orders to join the allies in a siege, the Duke of Marl∣borough
affirmed it was impossible to carry on a siege
without either hazarding a battle, in case the enemy
should attempt to relieve the place, or shamefully aban∣doning
the enterprise. The Duke of Argyle having de∣clared
his opinion, that since the time of Julius Caesar
there had not been a greater captain than Prince Eugene
of Savoy, observed, that, considering the different interests
of the House of Austria and of Great-Britain, it might
not consist with prudence to trust him with the manage∣ment
of the war, because a battle won or lost might en∣tirely
break off a negociation of peace, which in all pro∣bability
was near being concluded. He added, that two
years before, the confederates might have taken Arras and
Cambray, instead of amusing themselves with the insig∣nificant
conquests of Aire, Bethune, and St. Venant.
The Duke of Devonshire said he was, by proximity of
blood, more concerned than any other in the reputation of
the Duke of Ormond; and, therefore, could not help ex∣pressing
his surprise, that any one would dare to make a
nobleman of the first rank, and of so distinguished a cha∣racter,
the instrument of such proceedings. Earl Paulet
answered, that nobody could doubt the Duke of Ormond's
courage; but he was not like a certain general, who
led troops to the slaughter, to cause a great number of
officers to be knocked on the head, that he might fill his
pockets by disposing of their commissions. The Duke of
Marlborough was so deeply affected by this reflection,
that though he suppressed his resentment in the House, he
took the first opportunity to send Lord Mohun to the
Earl with a message, importing, that he should be glad to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome to an explanation with his lordship, about some
expressions he had used in that day's debate; and desiring
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is company to take the air in the country. The Earl
<PB N="222" REF="228"/>
understood his meaning; but could not conceal his emo∣tion
from the observation of his lady, by whose means
the affair was communicated to the Earl of Dartmouth,
secretary of state. Two centinels were immediately
placed at his lordship's gate: the Queen, by the canal of
Lord Dartmouth, desired the Duke of Marlborough would
proceed no farther in the quarrel; and he assured her he
would punctually obey her Majesty's commands. The
Earl of Oxford assured the House, that a separate peace
was never intended: that such a peace would be so base,
so knavish, and so villainous, that every one who served
the Queen knew they must answer it with their heads to
the nation; but that it would appear to be a safe and glo∣rious
peace, much more to the honour and interest of
the nation than the first preliminaries insisted upon by the
allies. The question being put for adjourning was, after a
long debate, carried in the affirmative; but twenty lords en∣tered
a protest. The Earl of Strafford, who had returned
from Holland, proposed, that they should examine the
negociations of the Hague and Gertruydenberg, before they
considered that of Utrecht. He observed, that in the
former negociations the French ministers had conferred
only with the Pensionary, who communicated no more of
it to the ministers of the allies than what was judged pro∣per
to let them know: so that the Dutch were absolute
masters of the secret. He asserted, that the States-General
had consented to give Naples and Sicily to King Philip:
a circumstance which proved that the recovery of the
whole Spanish monarchy was looked upon as impracticable.
He concluded with a motion for an address to her Majesty,
desiring that the papers relating to the negociations of the
Hague and Gertruydenberg should be laid before the House.
This was carried without a division.</P>
<P>§ VIII. In the House of Commons, Mr. Pulteney moved
for an address, acquainting her Majesty, that her faithful
Commons were justly alarmed at the intelligence received
from abroad, that her general in Flanders had declined
acting offensively against France, in concurrence with her
<PB N="223" REF="229"/>
allies; and beseeching her Majesty, that he might receive
speedy instructions to prosecute the war with the utmost
vigour. This motion was rejected by a great majority.
A certain member having insinuated, that the present ne∣gociation
had been carried on in a clandestine and treacher∣ous
manner, Mr. Secretary St. John said, he hoped it
would not be accounted treachery to act for the good and
advantage of Great-Britain: that he gloried in the small
share he had in the transaction; and whatever censure he
might undergo for it, the bare satisfaction of acting in
that view would be a sufficient recompense and comfort
to him during the whole course of his life. The House
resolved, That the Commons had an entire confidence in
her Majesty's promise, to communicate to her parliament
the terms of the peace before it should be concluded;
and, That they would support her against all such per∣sons,
either at home or abroad, as should endeavour
to obstruct the pacification. The Queen thanked them
heartily for this resolution, as being dutiful to her,
honest to their country, and very seasonable at a time
when so many artifices were used to obstruct a good
peace, or to force one disadvantageous to Britain. They
likewise presented an address, desiring they might have
an account of the negociations and transactions at the
Hague and Gertruydenberg, and know who were then
employed as her Majesty's plenipotentiaries.</P>
<P>§ IX. The ministry, foreseeing that Philip would not
willingly resign his hopes of succeeding to the crown of
France, proposed an alternative, that, in case of his pre∣ferring
his expectation of the crown of France to the pre∣sent
possession of Spain, this kingdom, with the Indies,
should be forthwith ceded to the Duke of Savoy; that
Philip, in the mean time, should possess the Duke's here∣ditary
dominions, and the kingdom of Sicily, together
with Mont<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>errat and Mantua; all which territories
should be annexed to France at Philip's succession to that
crown, except Sicily, which should revert to the House of
Austria. Louis seemed to relish this expedient, which,
<PB N="224" REF="230"/>
however, was rejected by Philip, who chose to make the
renunciation, rather than quit the throne upon which he
was established. The Queen demanded, that the renun∣ciation
should be ratified in the most solemn manner by
the states of France; but she afterwards waved this de∣mand,
in consideration of its being registered in the dif∣ferent
parliaments. Such forms are but slender securities
against the power, ambition, and interest of princes. The
Marquis de Tor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y frankly owned, that Philip's renun∣ciation
was of itself void, as being contrary to the funda∣mental
laws and constitution of the French monarchy;
but it was found necessary for the satisfaction of the Eng∣lish
people. Every material article being now adjusted be∣tween
the two courts, particularly those relating to the
King of Spain, the commerce of Great-Britain, and the
delivery of Dunkirk, a suspension of arms prevailed in
the Netherlands, and the Duke of Ormond acted in con∣cert
with Mareschal de Villars.</P>
<P>§ X. On the sixth day of June the Queen going to the
House of Peers, communicated the plan of peace to her
parliament, according to the promise she had made. Af∣ter
having premised, that the making peace and war was
the undoubted prerogative of the crown, and hinted at
the difficulties which had arisen both from the nature of
the affair, and numberless obstructions contrived by the
enemies of peace, she proceeded to enumerate the chief
articles to which both crowns had agreed, without, how∣ever,
concluding the treaty. She told them she had se∣cured
the protestant succession, which France had ac∣knowledged
in the strongest terms; and that the Pre∣tender
would be removed from the French dominions;
that the Duke of Anjoy should renounce for himself and
his descendants all claim to the crown of France; so that
the two monarchies would be for ever divided. She ob∣served,
that the nature of this proposal was such as would
execute itself: that it would be the interest of Spain to
support the renunciation; and in France, the persons
intitled to the succession of that crown upon the death of
<PB N="225" REF="231"/>
the Dauphin were powerful enough to vindicate their
own right. She gave them to understand, that a treaty
of commerce between England and France had been be∣gun,
though not yet adjusted; but provision was made,
that England should enjoy the same privileges that France
granted to the most favoured nation: that the French
King had agreed to make an absolute cession of the island
of St. Christopher's, which had hitherto been divided
between the two nations: that he had also consented to
restore the whole bay and straits of Hudson; to deliver
the island of Newfoundland, with Placentia; to cede An∣napolis,
with the rest of Acadia or Nova-Scotia; to de∣molish
the fortifications of Dunkirk; to leave England
in possession of Gibraltar, Port-Mahon, and the whole
island of Minorca; to let the trade of Spain in the West-Indies
be settled as it was in the reign of his late Catholick
Majesty: she signified that she had obtained for her sub∣jects
the assiento, or contract for furnishing the Spanish
West-Indies with negroes, for the term of thirty years,
in the same manner as it had been enjoyed by the French.
With respect to the allies, she declared, that France of∣fered
to make the Rhine the barrier of the empire: to
yield Brisac, Fort Kehl, and Landau, and raze all the
fortresses both on the other side of the Rhine, and in the
islands of that river: that the protestant interest in Ger∣many
would be resettled on the footing of the treaty of
Westphalia; that the Spanish Netherlands, the kingdoms
of Naples and Sardinia, the duchy of Milan, and the
places belonging to Spain on the coast of Tuscany might
be yielded to his Imperial Majesty; but the disposition
of Sicily was not yet determined: that the demands of
the States-General with relation to commerce, and the
barrier in the Low-Countries, would be granted with a
few exceptions, which might be compensated by other
expedients: that no great progress had yet been made
upon the pretensions of Portugal; but that those of
Prussia would be admitted by France without much diffi∣culty:
that the difference between the barrier demanded
<PB N="226" REF="232"/>
by the Duke of Savoy in the year one thousand seven
hundred and nine, and that which France now offered,
was very inconsiderable: that the Elector Palatine should
maintain his present rank among the Electors; and that
France would acknowledge the electral dignity in the
house of Hanover. Such were the conditions which
the Queen hoped would make some amends to her
subjects for the great and unequal burthen they had
bor'n during the whole course of the war. She con∣cluded
with saying, she made no doubt but they were
fully persuaded, that nothing would be neglected on her
part, in the progress of this negociation, to bring the peace
to an happy and speedy issue; and she expressed her depen∣dence
upon the entire confidence and chearful concurrence
of her parliament.</P>
<P>§ XI. An address of thanks and approbation was imme∣diately
voted, drawn up, and presented to the Queen by the
Commons in a body. When the House of Lords took the
speech into consideration, the Duke of Marlborough
asserted, that the measures pursued for a year past were
directly contrary to her Majesty's engagements with the
allies: that they sullied the triumphs and glories of her
reign; and would render the English name odious to all
nations. The Earl of Strafford said, that some of the
allies would not have shown such backwardness to a peace,
had they not been persuaded and encouraged to carry on
the war by a member of that illustrious assembly, who
maintained a secret correspondence with them, and fed
them with hopes that they would be supported by a strong
party in England. In answer to this insinuation against
Marlborough, Lord Cowper observed, that it could never
be suggested as a crime in the meanest subject, much less
in any member of that august assembly, to hold corres∣pondence
with the allies of the nation; such allies, especi∣ally,
whose interest her Majesty had declared to be insepa∣rable
from her own, in her speech at the opening of the
session; whereas it would be a hard matter to justify and
reconcile either with our laws, or with the laws of honour
<PB N="227" REF="233"/>
and justice, the conduct of some persons, in treating
clandestinely with the common enemy, without the parti∣cipation
of the allies. This was a frivolous argument. A
correspondence with any person whatsoever becomes cri∣minal,
when it tends to foment the divisions of one's
country, and arm the people against their sovereign. If
England had it not in her power, without infringing the
laws of justice and honour, to withdraw herself from a
confederacy which she could no longer support, and treat
for peace on her own bottom, then was she not an associate
but a slave to the alliance. The Earl of Godolphin
affirmed, that the trade to Spain was such a trifle as de∣served
no consideration; and that it would continually
diminish, until it should be entirely engrossed by the French
merchants. Notwithstanding these remonstrances against
the plan of peace, the majority agreed to an address, in
which they thanked the Queen for her extraordinary con∣descension
in communicating those conditions to her par∣liament;
and expressed an entire satisfaction with her con∣duct.
A motion was made for a clause in the address,
desiring her Majesty would take such measures, in concert
with her allies, as might induce them to join with her in a
mutual guarantee. A debate ensued: the question was
put, and the clause rejected. Several noblemen entered a
protest, which was expunged from the journals of the
House by the decision of the majority.</P>
<P>§ XII. In the House of Commons, a complaint was ex∣hibited
against Bishop Fleetwood, who, in a preface to
four sermons which he had published, took occasion to
extol the last ministry, at the expense of the present ad∣ministration.
This piece was voted malicious and factious,
tending to create discord and sedition amongst her Ma∣jesty's
subjects, and condemned to be burned by the hands
of the common hangman. They presented an address to
the Queen, assuring her of the just sense they had of the
indignity offered to her, by printing and publishing a letter
from the States-General to her Majesty; and desiring she
would so far resent such insults, as to give no answer for
<PB N="228" REF="234"/>
the future to any letters or memorials that should be thus
ushered into the world, as inflammatory appeals to the pub∣lick.
Mr. Hampden moved for an address to her Majesty,
that she would give particular instructions to her plenipo∣tentiaries,
that in the conclusion of the treaty of peace,
the several powers in alliance with her Majesty might be
guarantees for the protestant succession in the illustrious
house of Hanover. The question being put, was carried
in the negative. Then the House resolved, That they
had such confidence in the repeated declarations her Ma∣jesty
had made of her concern for assuring to these king∣doms
the protestant succession as by law established, that
they could never doubt of her taking the proper measures
for the security thereof: that the House would support her
against faction at home and her enemies abroad; and did
humbly beseech her, that she would be pleased to dis∣countenance
all those who should endeavour to raise
jealousies between her Majesty and her subjects, espe∣cially
by misrepresenting her good intentions for the welfare
of her people. The Queen was extremely pleased with
this resolution. When it was presented, she told them
that they had shown themselves honest asserters of the
monarchy, zealous defenders of the constitution, and real
friends to the protestant succession. She thought she had
very little reason to countenance a compliment of super∣erogation
to a prince who had caballed with the enemies
of her administration. On the twenty-first day of June
the Queen closed the session with a speech, expressing her
satisfaction at the addresses and supplies she had received:
she observed, that should the treaty be broke off, their
burthens would be at least continued, if not increased:
that Britain would lose the present opportunity of improving
her own commerce, and establishing a real balance of power
in Europe; and that though some of the allies might be
gainers by a continuance of the war, the rest would suffer
in the common calamity. Notwithstanding the ferment of
the people, which was now risen to a very dangerous
pitch, addresses, approving the Queen's conduct, were
<PB N="229" REF="235"/>
presented by the city of London, and all the corporations
in the kingdom that espoused the Tory-interest. At this
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uncture the nation was so wholly possessed by the spirit of
party, that no appearance of neutrality or moderation re∣mained.</P>
<P>§ XIII. During these transactions the trenches were open∣ed
before Quesnoy, and the siege carried on with uncommon
vigour under cover of the forces commanded by the Duke
of Ormond. This nobleman, however, having received
a copy of the articles, signed by the Marquis de Tor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,
and fresh instructions from the Queen, signified to Prince
Eugene and the Dutch deputies, that the French King
had agreed to several articles demanded by the Queen, as
the foundation of an armistice; and among others, to put
the English troops in immediate possession of Dunkirk: that
he could, therefore, no longer cover the siege of Quesnoy,
as he was obliged by his instructions to march with the British
troops, and those in the Queen's pay, and declare a sus∣pension
of arms as soon as he should be possessed of Dun∣kirk.
He expressed his hope, that they would readily ac∣quiesce
in these instructions, seeing their concurrence
would act as the most powerful motive to induce the Queen
to take all possible care of their interests at the congress;
and he endeavoured to demonstrate, that Dunkirk, as a
cautionary town, was a place of greater consequence to the
allies than Quesnoy. The deputies desired he would de∣lay
his march five days, that they might have time to con∣sult
their principals, and he granted three days without
hesitation. Prince Eugene observed, that his marching
off with the British troops, and the foreigners in the Queen's
pay, would leave the allies at the mercy of the enemy:
but he hoped these last would not obey the Duke's order.
He and the deputies had already tampered with their com∣manding
officers, who absolutely refused to obey the Duke
of Ormond, alledging, that they could not separate from
the consederacy without express directions from their
masters, to whom they had dispatched couriers. An ex∣traordinary
assembly of the States was immediately sum∣moned
<PB N="230" REF="236"/>
to meet at the Hague. The ministers of the allies
were invited to the conferences. At length, the princes
whose troops were in the pay of Britain assured them,
that they would maintain them under the command of
Prince Eugene for one month at their own expense, and
afterwards sustain half the charge, provided the other
half should be defrayed by the Emperor and States-Gene∣ral.</P>
<P>§ XIV. The Bishop of Bristol imparted to the other
plenipotentiaries at Utrecht the concessions which France
would make to the allies; and proposed a suspension of
arms for two months, that they might treat in a friendly
manner, and adjust the demands of all the confederates.
To this proposal they made no other answer, but that they
had no instructions on the subject. Count Zinzendorf,
the first Imperial plenipotentiary, presented a memorial to
the States-General, explaining the danger that would re∣sult
to the common cause from a cessation of arms; and
exhorting them to persevere in their generous and vigorous
resolutions. He proposed a renewal of the alliance for re∣covering
the Spanish monarchy to the house of Austria,
and a certain plan for prosecuting the war with redoubled
ardour. Prince Eugene, in order to dazzle the confede∣rates
with some bold enterprise, detached Major-General
Grovestein, with fifteen hundred cavalry, to penetrate into
the heart of France. This officer, about the middle of
June, advanced into Champagne, passed the Noire, the
Maese, the Moselle, and the Saar, and retired to Traer∣bach
with a rich booty, and a great number of hostages,
after having extorted contributions as far as the gates of
Metz, ravaged the country, and reduced a great number
of villages and towns to ashes. The consternation pro∣duced
by this irruption reached the city of Paris: the
King of France did not think himself safe at Versailles
with his ordinary guards: all the troops in the neigh∣bourhood
of the capital were assembled about the palace.
Villars sent a detachment after Grovestein, as soon as he
understood his destination: but the other had gained a
<PB N="231" REF="237"/>
day's march of the French troops, which had the morti∣fication
to follow him so close, that they found the flames
still burning in the villages he had destroyed. By way of
retaliation, Major-General Pasteur, a French partisan,
made an excursion beyond Bergen-op-zoom, and ravaged
the island of Tortole belonging to Zealand.</P>
<P>§ XV. The Earl of Strafford having returned to Hol∣land,
proposed a cessation of arms to the States-General,
by whom it was rejected. Then he proceeded to the army
of the Duke of Ormond, where he arrived in a few days
after the reduction of Quesnoy, the garrison of which were
made prisoners of war on the fourth day of July. The
officers of the foreign troops had a second time refused
to obey a written order of the Duke: and such a spirit of
animosity began to prevail between the English and allies,
that it was absolutely necessary to effect a speedy separation.
Prince Eugene resolved to undertake the siege of Landrecy:
a design is said to have been formed by the German generals
to confine the Duke, on pretence of the arrears that were due
to them; and to disarm the British troops, left they should
join the French army. In the mean time, a literary cor∣respondence
was maintained between the English general
and the Mareschal de Villars. France having consented to
deliver up Dunkirk, a body of troops was transported from
England, under the command of Brigadier Hill, who took
possession of the place on the seventh day of July, the
French garrison retiring to Winoxberg. On the sixteenth
of the same month Prince Eugene marched from his camp
at Haspre, and was followed by all the auxiliaries in the
British pay, except a few battalions of the troops of Hol∣stein-Cottorp,
and Wales's regiment of dragoons belong∣ing
to the state of Liege.</P>
<P>§ XVI. Landrecy was immediately invested, while the
Duke of Ormond, with the English forces, removed from
Chateau-Cambresis, and encamping at Avesne-le-Secq,
proclaimed by sound of trumpet a cessation of arms for two
months. On the same day the like armistice was declared
in the French army. The Dutch were so exasperated at
<PB N="232" REF="238"/>
the secession of the English troops, that the governours
would not allow the Earl of Strafford to enter Bouchaine,
nor the British army to pass through Douay, though in
that town they had left a great quantity of stores, together
with their general hospital. Prince Eugene and the
Dutch deputies, understanding that the Duke of Ormond
had begun his march towards Ghent, began to be in pain
for that city, and sent Count Nassau Woudenburg to
him with a written apology, condemning and disavowing
the conduct of the commandants of Bouchaine and Douay:
but, notwithstanding these excuses, the English troops
afterwards met with the same treatment at Tournay, Ou∣denarde,
and Lisle: insults which were resented by the
whole British nation. The Duke, however, pursued his
march, and took possession of Ghent and Bruges for the
Queen of England: then he re-enforced the garrison of
Dunkirk, which he likewise supplied with artillery and
ammunition. His conduct was no less agreeable to his
sovereign, than mortifying to the Dutch, who never
dreamed of leaving Ghent and Bruges in the hands of the
English, and were now fairly outwitted, and anticipated
by the motions and expedition of the British general.</P>
<P>§ XVII. The loss of the British forces was soón severe∣ly
felt in the allied army. Villars attacked a separate
body of their troops encamped at Denain, under the com∣mand
of the Earl of Albemarle. Their entrenchments
were forced, and seventeen battalions either killed or taken.
The Earl himself and all the surviving officers were made
prisoners. Five hundred waggons loaded with bread,
twelve pieces of brass cannon, a large quantity of am∣munition
and provisions, a great number of horses, and a
considerable booty fell into the hands of the enemy: this
advantage they gained in sight of Prince Eugene, who ad∣vanced
on the other side of the Schedule to sustain Albe∣marle;
but the bridge over that river was broke down by
accident; so that he was prevented from lending the least
assistance. Villars immediately invested Marchiennes,
where the principal stores of the allies were lodged. The
<PB N="233" REF="239"/>
place was surrendered on the last day of July: and the
garrison, consisting of five thousand men, were conducted
prisoners to Valenciennes. He afterwards undertook the
siege of Douay; an enterprise, in consequence of which
Prince Eugene abandoned his design on Landrecy, and
marched towards the French, in order to hazard an en∣gagement.
The States, however, would not run the
risque; and the Prince had the mortification to see Douay
reduced by the enemy. He could not even prevent their
retaking Quesnoy and Bouchain, of which places they
were in possession before the tenth day of October. The
allies enjoyed no other compensation for their great losses,
but the conquest of Fort Knocque, which was surprised by
one of their partisans.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. The British ministers at the congress con∣tinued
to press the Dutch and other allies to join in the
armistice; but they were deaf to the proposal, and con∣certed
measures for a vigorous prosecution of the war.
Then the Earl of Strafford insisted upon their admitting
to the congress the plenipotentiaries of King Philip; but
he found them equally averse to this expedient. In the
beginning of August, Secretary St. John, now created
Lord Viscount Bolingbroke, was sent to the court of Ver∣sailles
incognito, to remove all obstructions to the treaty
between England and France. He was accompanied by
Mr. Prior and the Abbé Gualtier, treated with the most
distinguished marks of respect, caressed by the French
King and the Marquis de Torcy, with whom he adjusted
the principal interests of the Duke of Savoy and the Elec∣tor
of Bavaria. He settled the time and manner of the
renunciations, and agreed to a suspension of arms by sea
and land for four months between the crowns of France
and England: this was accordingly proclaimed at Paris
and London. The negociation being finished in a few
days, Bolingbroke returned to England, and Prior re∣mained
as resident at the court of France. The States-General
breathed nothing but war: the Pensionary Hein∣sius
pronounced an oration in their assembly, representing
<PB N="234" REF="240"/>
the impossibility of concluding a peace without losing the
fruits of all the blood and treasure they had expended.
The conferences at Utrecht were interrupted by a quarrel
between the domesticks of Menager, and those of the
Count de Rechteren, one of the Dutch plenipotentiaries.
The populace insulted the Earl of Strafford and the Mar∣quis
del Borgo, minister of Savoy, whose master was re∣ported
to have agreed to the armistice. These obstructions
being removed, the conferences were renewed, and the
British plenipotentiaries exerted all their rhetorick, both in
public and private, to engage the allies in the Queen's
measures. At length the Duke of Savoy was prevailed
upon to acquiesce in the offers of France. Mr. Thomas
Harley had been sent ambassador to Hanover, with a view
to persuade the Elector that it would be for his interest to
co-operate with her Majesty; but that prince's resolution
was already taken. “Whenever it shall please God
(said he) to call me to the throne of Britain, I hope to
act as becomes me for the advantage of my people: in
the mean time, speak to me as to a German prince, and
a prince of the empire.” Nor was she more successful
in her endeavours to bring over the King of Prussia to her
sentiments. In the mean time, Lord Lexington was ap∣pointed
ambassador to Madrid, where King Philip solemnly
swore to observe the renunciation, which was approved
and confirmed by the Cortez. The like renunciation to
the crown of Spain was afterwards made by the princes of
France; and Philip was declared incapable of succeeding
to the crown of that realm. The court of Portugal held
out against the remonstrances of England, until the Mar∣quis
de Bay invaded that kingdom at the head of twenty
thousand men, and undertook the siege of Campo-Major,
and they sound they had no longer any hope of being
assisted by his Britannick Majesty. The Portuguese mi∣nister
at Utrecht signed the suspension of arms on the
seventh day of November, and excused this step to the
allies, as the pure effect of necessity. The English troops
in Spain were ordered to separate from the army of Count
<PB N="235" REF="241"/>
Staremberg, and march to the neighbourhood of Barce∣lona,
where they were embarked on board an English squa∣dron,
commanded by Sir John Jennings, and transported to
Minorca.</P>
<P>§ XIX. The campaign being at an end in the Nether∣lands,
the Duke of Ormond returned to England, where
the party-disputes were become more violent than ever.
The Whigs affected to celebrate the anniversary of the
late King's birth-day, in London, with extraordinary re∣joicings.
Mobs were hired by both factions; and the
whole city was filled with riot and uproar. A ridiculous
scheme was contrived to frighten the Lord-Treasurer
with some squibs in a band-box, which the ministers
magnified into a conspiracy. The Duke of Hamilton
having been appointed ambassador extraordinary to the
court of France, the Whigs were alarmed, on the suppo∣sition
that this nobleman favoured the Pretender. Some
dispute arising between the Duke and Lord Mohun, on the
subject of a law-suit, furnished a pretence for a quarrel.
Mohun, who had been twice tried for murther, and was
counted a mean tool, as well as the Hector of the Whig
party, sent a message by General Macartney to the Duke,
challenging him to single combat. The principals met
by appointment in Hyde-Park, attended by Macartney and
Colonel Hamilton. They fought with such fury, that
Mohun was killed upon the spot, and the Duke expired
before he could be conveyed to his own house. Macart∣ney
disappeared, and escaped in disguise to the continent.
Colonel Hamilton declared upon oath before the privy-council,
that when the principals engaged, he and Ma∣cartney
followed their example; that Macartney was im∣mediately
disarmed; but the Colonel seeing the Duke fall
upon his antagonist, threw away the swords, and ran to
lift him up; that while he was employed in raising the
Duke, Macartney, having taken up one of the swords,
stabbed his grace over Hamilton's shoulder, and retired
immediately. A proclamation was issued, promising a
reward of five hundred pounds to those who should
<PB N="236" REF="242"/>
apprehend or discover Macartney, and the Duchess of Ha∣milton
offered three hundred pounds for the same purpose.
The Tories exclaimed against this event as a party duel:
they treated Macartney as a cowardly assassin; and af∣firmed
that Whigs had posted others of the same stamp
all round Hyde-Park, to murther the Duke of Hamilton,
in case he had triumphed over his antagonist, and escaped
the treachery of Macartney. The Whigs, on the other
hand, affirmed, that it was altogether a private quarrel:
that Macartney was entirely innocent of the persidy laid
to his charge: that he afterwards submitted to a fair
trial, at which Colonel Hamilton prevaricated in giving
his evidence, and was contradicted by the testimony of
divers persons who saw the combat at a distance. The
Duke of Marlborough, hearing himself accused as the au∣thor
of those party mischiefs, and seeing his enemies grow
every day more and more implacable, thought proper to
retire to the continent, where he was followed by his du∣chess.
His friend Godolphin had died in September, with
the general character of an able, cool, dispassionate mini∣ster,
who had rendered himself necessary to four succes∣sive
sovereigns, and managed the finances with equal skill
and integrity. The Duke of Shrewsbury was nominated
ambassador to France, in the room of the Duke of Hamil∣ton:
the Duke d'Aumount arrived at London in the
same quality from the court of Versailles; and about the
same time the Queen granted an audience to the Marquis
de Montelcone, whom Philip had appointed one of his
plenipotentiaries at the congress.</P>
<P>§ XX. In vain had the British ministers in Holland
endeavoured to overcome the obstinacy of the States-Ge∣neral,
by alternate threats, promises, and arguments. In
vain did they represent, that the confederacy against
France could be no longer supported with any prospect of
success: that the Queen's aim had been to procure rea∣sonable
terms for her allies; but that their opposition to
her measures prevented her from obtaining such conditi∣ons
as she would have a right to demand in their favour,
<PB N="237" REF="243"/>
were they unanimous in their consultations. In Novem∣ber,
the Earl of Strafford presented a new plan of peace,
in which the Queen promised to insist upon France's
ceding to the States the city of Tournay, and some other
places which they could not expect to possess, should
she conclude a separate treaty. They now began to wa∣ver
in their councils. The first transports of their re∣sentment
having subsided, they plainly perceived that the
continuation of the war would entail upon them a bur∣then
which they could not bear, especially since the Duke
of Savoy and the King of Portugal had deserted the alli∣ance:
besides, they were staggered by the affair of the
new barrier, so much more advantageous than that which
France had proposed in the beginning of the conferences.
They were influenced by another motive: namely, the
apprehension of new mischiefs to the empire from the
King of Sweden, whose affairs seemed to take a favourable
turn at the Ottoman Porte, through the intercession of
the French monarch. The Czar and King Augustus
had penetrated into Pomerania: the King of Denmark had
taken Staden, reduced Bremen, and laid Hamburgh under
contribution; but Count Steenbock, the Swedish general,
defeated the Danish army in Mecklenbourg, ravaged Hol∣stein
with great barbarity, and reduced the town of Al∣tena
to ashes. The Grand Signor threatened to declare
war against the Czar, or pretence that he had not per∣formed
some essential articles of the late peace: but his
real motive was an inclination to support the King of
Sweden. This disposition, however, was defeated by a
powerful party at the Porte, who were averse to war-Charles,
who still remained at Bender, was desired to re∣turn
to his own kingdom, and given to understand, that
the Sultan would procure him a safe passage. He treated
the person who brought this intimation with the most
outrageous insolence; rejected the proposal; fortified his
house; and resolved to defend himself to the last extre∣mity.
Being attacked by a considerable body of Turkish
forces, he and his attendants sought with the most frantick
<PB N="238" REF="244"/>
valour. They flew some hundreds of the assailants; but at
last the Turks set fire to the house: so that he was obliged
to surrender himself and his followers, who were generally
sold for slaves. He himself was conveyed under a strong
guard to Adrianople. Mean while the Czar landed with an
army in Finland, which he totally reduced. Steenbock
maintained himself in Tonningen until all his supplies
were cut off; and then he was obliged to deliver himself
and his troops prisoners of war. But this reverse was not
foreseen when the Dutch dreaded a rupture between the
Porte and the Muscovites, and were given to understand
that the Turks would revive the troubles in Hungary. In
that case, they knew the Emperor would recall great part
of his troops from the Netherlands, where the burthen of
the war must lie upon their shoulders. After various con∣sultations
in their different assemblies, they came into the
Queen's measures, and signed the barrier treaty.</P>
<P>§ XXI. Then the plenipotentiaries of the four asso∣ciated
circles presented a remonstrance to the British mi∣nisters
at Utrecht, imploring the Queen's interposition in
their favour, that they might not be left in the miserable
condition to which they had been reduced by former
treaties. They were given to understand, that if they
should not obtain what they desired, they themselves
would be justly blamed as the authors of their own dis∣appointment:
that they had been deficient in furnishing
their proportion of troops and other necessaries; and left
the whole burthen of the war to fall upon the Queen and
the States in the Netherlands: that when a cessation was
judged necessary, they had deserted her Majesty to follow
the chimerical projects of Prince Eugene: that while she
prosecuted the war with the utmost vigour, they had acted
with coldness and indifference; but when she inclined to
peace they began to exert themselves in prosecuting ho∣stilities
with uncommon eagerness: that, nevertheless,
she would not abandon their interests, but endeavour to
procure for them as good conditions as their preposterous
conduct would allow her to demand. Even the Emperor's
<PB N="239" REF="245"/>
plenipotentiaries began to talk in more moderate terms.
Zinzendorf declared that his master was very well dis∣posed
to promote a general peace; and no longer insisted
on a cession of the Spanish monarchy to the House of
Austria. Philip's ministers, together with those of Bava∣ria
and Cologn, were admitted to the congress; and now
the plenipotentiaries of Britain acted as mediators for the
rest of the allies.</P>
<P>§ XXII. The pacification between France and England
was retarded, however, by some unforeseen difficulties that
arose in adjusting the commerce and the limits of the
countries possessed by both nations in North-America. A
long dispute ensued; and the Duke of Shrewsbury and
Prior held many conferences with the French ministry: at
length it was compromised, though not much to the ad∣vantage
of Great-Britain; and the English plenipoten∣tiaries
received an order to sign a separate treaty. They
declared to the ministers of the other powers, that they
and some other plenipotentiaries were ready to sign their
respective treaties on the eleventh day of April. Count Zin∣zendorf
endeavoured to postpone this transaction until he
should be furnished with fresh instructions from Vienna;
and even threatened that if the States should sign the
peace contrary to his desire,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> the Emperor would imme∣diately
withdraw his troops from the Netherlands.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boyer.</NOTE> The

that his Imperial Majesty should have time to consider whe∣ther

to Count Zinzendorf, in writing, “offers and de∣mands
of the French King for making peace with the
House of Austria and the empire.” The Count and
the ministers of the German princes exclaimed against
<PB N="240" REF="246"/>
the insolence of France, which had not even bestowed the
title of Emperor on Joseph; but wanted to impose terms
upon them with relation to the Electors of Cologn and
Bavaria.</P>
<P>§ XXIII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1713.</NOTE> The treaties of peace and commerce between
England and France being ratified by the Queen of Eng∣land,
the parliament was assembled on the ninth day of April,
The Queen told them the treaty was signed, and that in
a few days the ratifications would be exchanged. She
said, what she had done for the protestant succession, and
the perfect friendship subsisting between her and the house
of Hanover, would convince those who wished well to both,
and desired the quiet and safety of their country, how
vain all attempts were to divide them. She left it entirely
to the House of Commons to determine what force might
be necessary for the security of trade by sea, and for guards
and garrisons. “Make yourselves safe (said she) and I
shall be satisfied. Next to the protection of the divine
providence, I depend upon the loyalty and affection of
my people. I want no other guarantee.” She recom∣mended
to their protection those brave men who had ex∣posed
their lives in the service of their country, and could
not be employed in time of peace. She desired they would
concert proper measures for easing the foreign trade of the
kingdom, for improving and encouraging manufactures
and the fishery: and for employing the hands of idle
people. She expressed her displeasure at the scandalous
and seditious libels which had been lately published. She
exhorted them to consider of new laws to prevent this li∣centiousness,
as well as for putting a stop to the impious
practice of duelling. She conjured them to use their ut∣most
endeavours to calm the minds of men at home, that
the arts of peace might be cultivated; and that ground∣less
jealousies contrived by a faction, and fomented by
party-rage, might not essect that which their foreign ene∣mies
could not accomplish. This was the language of a
pious, candid, and benevolent sovereign, who loved her
<PB N="241" REF="247"/>
subjects with a truly parental affection.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. X1. 1713.</NOTE> The parliament
considered her in that light. Each House presented her
with a warm address of thanks and congratulation, ex∣pressing,
in particular, their inviolable attachment to the
protestant succession in the illustrious house of Hanover.
The ratifications of the treaty being exchanged, the peace
was proclaimed on the fifth of May, with the usual cere∣monies,
to the inexpressible joy of the nation in general:
it was about this period that the Chevalier de St. George
conveyed a printed remonstrance to the ministers at Utrecht,
solemnly protesting against all that might be stipulated to
his prejudice. The Commons, in a second address, had
besought her Majesty to communicate to the House in due
time the treaties of peace and commerce with France; and
now they were produced by Mr. Benson, Chancellor of the
Exchequer.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. By the treaty of peace the French King obli∣ged
himself to abandon the Pretender, and acknowledge
the Queen's title and the protestant succession; to raze
the fortifications of Dunkirk within a limited time, on
condition of receiving an equivalent; to cede Newfound∣land,
Hudson's-Bay, and St. Christopher's to England;
but, the French were left in possession of Cape Breton,
and at liberty to dry their fish on Newfoundland. By the
treaty of commerce a free trade was established, according
to the tariff of the year one thousand six hundred and sixty∣four,
except in some commodities that were subjected to new
regulations in the year sixteen hundred and ninety-nine.
It was agreed, That no other duties should be imposed on
the productions of France imported into England than
those that were laid on the same commodities from other
countries; and, That commissaries should meet at Lon∣don,
to adjust all matters relating to commerce: as for
the tariff with Spain, it was not yet finished. It was
stipulated, That the Emperor should possess the kingdom
of Naples, the duchy of Milan, and the Spanish Nether∣lands:
That the Duke of Savoy should enjoy Sicily, with
the title of king: That the same title, with the island of
<PB N="242" REF="248"/>
Sardinia, should be allotted to the Elector of Bavaria,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK 1. 1713.</NOTE> as
an indemnification for his losses: That the States-General
should restore Lisle and its dependencies: That Namur,
Charleroy, Luxembourg, Ypres, and Newport should be
added to the other places they already possessed in Flan∣ders;
and That the King of Prussia should have Upper-Gueldre,
in lieu of Orange and the other estates belong∣ing
to that family in Franche Comté. The King of
Portugal was satisfied; and the first day of June was fixed
as the period of time granted to the Emperor for conside∣ration.</P>
<P>§ XXV. A day being appointed by the Commons to
deliberate upon the treaty of commerce, very just and
weighty objections were made to the eighth and ninth arti∣cles,
importing, That Great-Britain and France should
mutually enjoy all the privileges in trading with each
other that either granted to the most favoured nation;
and that no higher customs should be exacted from the
commodities of France, than those that were drawn from
the same productions of any other people. The balance of
trade having long inclined to the side of France, severe
duties had been laid on all the productions and manu∣factures
of that kingdom, so as almost to amount to a
total prohibition. Some members observed, that, by the
treaty between England and Portugal, the duties charged
upon the wines of that country were lower than those
laid upon the wines of France: that should they now be
reduced to an equality, the difference of freight was so
great, that the French wines would be found much cheap∣er
than those of Portugal; and, as they were more agree∣able
to the taste of the nation in general, there would be
no market for the Portuguese wines in England: that
should this be the case, the English would lose their trade
with Portugal, the most advantageous of any traffick which
they now carried on: for it consumed a great quantity of
their manufactures, and returned a yearly sum of six hun∣dred
thousand pounds in gold. Mr. Nathaniel Gould,
formerly governor of the Bank, affirmed, that a France
<PB N="243" REF="249"/>
had, since the Revolution, encouraged woolen manufactures,
and prepared at home several commodities which formerly
they drew from England; so the English had learned to
make silk stuffs, paper, and all manner of toys formerly
imported from France: by which means, an infinite
number of artificers was employed, and a vast sum annually
saved to the nation: but these people would now be re∣duced
to beggary, and that money lost again to the king∣dom,
should French commodities of the same kind be im∣ported
under ordinary duties, because labour was much
cheaper in France than in England, consequently the
British manufactures would be undersold and ruined. He
urged, that the ruin of the silk manufacture would be at∣tended
with another disadvantage. Great quantities of
woolen cloths were vended in Italy and Turkey, in con∣sequence
of the raw silk which the English merchants
bought up in those countries; and, should the silk manu∣facture
at home be lost, those markets for British commo∣dities
would fail of course. Others alledged, that if the
articles of commerce had been settled before the English
troops separated from those of the confederates, the French
King would not have presumed to insist upon such terms,
but have been glad to comply with more moderate con∣ditions.
Sir William Wyndham reflected on the late mini∣stry,
for having neglected to make an advantageous peace
when it was in their power. He said that Portugal would
always have occasion for the woolen manufactures and
the corn of England, and be obliged to buy them at all
events. After a violent debate, the House resolved, by a
great majority, That a bill should be brought in to make
good the eighth and ninth articles of the treaty of com∣merce
with France. Against these articles, however, the
Portuguese minister presented a memorial, declaring, that
should the duties on French wines be lowered to the same
level with those that were laid on the wines of Portugal,
his master would renew the prohibition of the woolen
manufactures, and other products of Great-Britain. In∣deed,
all the trading part of the nation exclaimed against
<PB N="244" REF="250"/>
the treaty of commerce, which seems to have been con∣cluded
in a hurry, before the ministers fully understood
the nature of the subject. This precipitation was owing to
the fears that their endeavours after peace would miscarry,
from the intrigues of the Whig faction, and the obstinate
opposition of the confederates.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. The Commons having granted an aid of two
shillings in the pound, proceeded to renew the duty on
malt for another year, and extended this tax to the whole
island, notwithstanding the warm remonstrances of the
Scottish members, who represented it as a burthen which
their country could not bear. They insisted upon an ex∣press
article of the Union, stipulating, That no duty
should be laid on the malt in Scotland during the war,
which they affirmed was not yet finished, inasmuch as the
peace with Spain had not been proclaimed. During the
adjournment of the parliament, on account of the Whitsun
holidays, the Scots of both Houses, laying aside all party-distinctions,
met and deliberated on this subject. They
deputed the Duke of Argyle, the Earl of Mar, Mr.
Lockhart, and Mr. Cockburn, to lay their grievances
before the Queen. They represented, that their country∣men
bore with impatience the violation of some articles
of the Union; and that the imposition of such an insup∣portable
burthen as the malt-tax would in all probability
prompt them to declare the Union dissolved. The Queen,
alarmed at this remonstrance, answered, that she wished
they might not have cause to repent of such a precipitate
resolution; but she would endeavour to make all things
easy. On the first day of June, the Earl of Findlater, in
the House of Peers, represented that the Scottish nation
was aggrieved in many instances; that they were deprived
of a privy-council, and subjected to the English laws in cases
of treason; that their nobles were rendered incapable
of being created British peers; and that now they were
oppressed with the insupportable burthen of a malt-tax,
when they had reason to expect they should reap the bene∣fits
of peace; he, therefore, moved, that leave might be
<PB N="245" REF="251"/>
given to bring in a bill for dissolving the Union, and se∣curing
the protestant succession in the house of Hanover.
Lord North and Grey affirmed, that the complaints of
the Scots were groundless; that the dissolution of the
Union was impracticable; and he made some sarcastick re∣flexions
on the poverty of that nation. He was answered
by the Earl of Eglington, who admitted the Scots were poor,
and therefore unable to pay the malt-tax. The Earl of
Ilay, among other pertinent remarks upon the Union, ob∣served,
that when the treaty was made, the Scots took it
for granted that the parliament of Great-Britain would
never load them with any imposition that they had reason
to believe grievous. The Earl of Peterborough compared
the Union to a marriage. He said, that though England,
who must be supposed the husband, might in some instances
prove unkind to the lady, she ought not immediately to sue
for a divorce, the rather because she had very much mended
her fortune by the match. Ilay replied, that marriage was an
ordinance of God; and the Union no more than a political
expedient. The other affirmed, that the contract could
not have been more solemn, unless, like the ten com∣mandments,
it had come from heaven: he inveighed
against the Scots, as a people that would never be satisfied;
that would have all the advantages resulting from the Union,
but would pay nothing by their good will, although they
had received more money from England than the amount
of all their estates. To these animadversions the Duke of
Argyle made a very warm reply. “I have been reflected
on by some people (said he) as if I was disgusted, and had
changed sides; but I despise their persons, as much as
I undervalue their judgement.” He urged, that the malt-tax
in Scotland was like taxing land by the acre through∣out
England, because land was worth five pounds an acre
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the neighbourhood of London, and would not fetch so
many shillings in the remote counties. In like manner,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he English malt was valued at four times the price of that
which was made in Scotland; therefore, the tax in this
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ountry must be levied by a regiment of dragoons. He
<PB N="246" REF="252"/>
owned he had a great share in making the Union, with a
view to secure the protestant succession; but he was now
satisfied this end might be answered as effectually if the
Union was dissolved; and, if this step should not be taken,
he did not expect long to have either property left in Scot∣land,
or liberty in England. All the Whig members
voted for the dissolution of that treaty which they had so
eagerly promoted; while the Tories strenuously supported
the measure against which they had once argued with
such vehemence. In the course of the debate, the Lord-Treasurer
observed, that although the malt-tax were im∣posed,
it might be afterwards remitted by the crown.
The Earl of Sunderland expressed surprise at hearing that
noble lord broach a doctrine which tended to establish a
despotick dispensing power, and arbitrary government. Ox∣ford
replied, his family had never been famous, as some
others had been, for promoting and advising arbitrary mea∣sures.
Sunderland, considering this expression as a sar∣casm
levelled at the memory of his father, took occasion
to vindicate his conduct; adding, that in those days the
other lord's family was hardly known. Much violent alter∣cation
was discharged. At length the motion for the bill
was rejected by a small majority, and the malt-bill after∣wards
passed with great difficulty.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. Another bill being brought into the House
of Commons, for rendering the treaty of commerce ef∣fectual,
such a number of petitions were delivered against
it, and so many solid arguments advanced by the merchants
who were examined on the subject, that even a great num∣ber
of Tory members were convinced of the bad conse∣quence
it would produce to trade, and voted against the
ministry on this occasion; so that the bill was rejected by
a majority of nine voices. At the same time, however,
the House agreed to an address, thanking her Majesty for
the great care she had taken of the security and honour o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
her kingdoms in the treaty of peace; as also for having
laid so good a foundation for the interest of her people in
trade. They likewise besought her to appoint commis∣sioners
<PB N="247" REF="253"/>
to treat with those of France, for adjusting such
matters as should be necessary to be settled on the subject
of commerce, that the treaty might be explained and per∣fected
for the good and welfare of her people. The Queen
interpreted this address into a full approbation of the trea∣ties
of peace and commerce, and thanked them accordingly
in the warmest terms of satisfaction and acknowledgement.
The Commons afterwards desired to know what equivalent
should be given for the demolition of Dunkirk; and she
gave them to understand, that this was already in the
hands of his most Christian Majesty: then they besought
her that she would not evacuate the towns of Flanders
that were in her possession, until those who were entitled
to the sovereignty of the Spanish Netherlands should agree
to such articles for regulating trade as might place the
subjects of Great-Britain upon an equal footing with those
of any other nation. The Queen made a favourable an∣swer
to all their remonstrances. Such were the steps
taken by the parliament during this session with relation
to the famous treaty of Utrecht, against which the Whigs
exclaimed so violently, that many well-meaning people
believed it would be attended with the immediate ruin of
the kingdom: yet, under the shadow of this very treaty,
Great-Britain enjoyed a long term of peace and tran∣quillity.
Bishop Burnet was heated with an enthusiastick
terrour of the House of Bourbon. He declared to the Queen
in private, that any treaty by which Spain and the West-Indies
were left in the hands of King Philip must in a
little time deliver all Europe into the hands of France:
that if any such peace was made, the Queen was betrayed,
and her people ruined: that in less than three years she
would be murthered, and the fires would blaze again in
Smithfield. This prelate lived to see his prognostick dis∣appointed;
therefore, he might have suppressed this anec∣dote
of his own conduct.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. On the twenty-fifth day of June, the
Queen signified, in a message to the House of Commons,
that her civil list was burthened with some debts incurred
<PB N="248" REF="254"/>
by several articles of extraordinary expense; and that she
hoped they would empower her to raise such a sum of
money upon the funds for that provision, as would be
sufficient to discharge the incumberances, which amounted
to five hundred thousand pounds. A bill was immediately
prepared for raising this sum on the civil-list revenue, and
passed through both Houses with some difficulty. Both
Lords and Commons addressed the Queen concerning the
Chevalier de St. George, who had repaired to Lorraine.
They desired she would press the Duke of that name, and
all the princes and states in amity with her, to exclude from
their dominions the pretender to the imperial crown of
Great-Britain. A publick thanksgiving for the peace
was appointed and celebrated with great solemnity; and
on the sixteenth day of July the Queen closed the session
with a speech which was not at all agreeable to the violent
Whigs, because it did not contain one word about the Pre∣tender
and the protestant succession. From these omissions
they concluded, that the dictates of natural affection had bi∣assed
her in favour of the Chevalier de St. George. What∣ever
sentiments of tenderness and compassion she might
feel for that unfortunate exile, the acknowledged son of
her own father, it does not appear that she ever entertained
a thought of altering the succession as by law established.
The term of Sacheverel's suspension being expired, extra∣ordinary
rejoicing were made upon the occasion. He
was desired to preach before the House of Commons, who
thanked him for his sermon; and the Queen promoted
him to the rich benefice of St. Andrew's, Holbourn. On
the other hand, the Duke d'Aumount, ambassador from
France, was insulted by the populace. Scurrilous ballad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
were published against him both in the English and French
languages. He received divers anonymous letters, con∣taining
threats of setting fire to his house, which was ac∣cordingly
burned to the ground, though whether by acci∣dent
or design he could not well determine. The ma∣gistracy
of Dunkirk, having sent a deputation with an
address to the Queen, humbly imploring her Majesty to
<PB N="249" REF="255"/>
spare the port and harbour of that town, and representing
that they might be useful to her own subjects, the memorial
was printed and dispersed, and the arguments it contained
were answered and refuted by Addison, Steele, and Mayn∣waring.
Commissioners were sent to see the fortifications
of Dunkirk demolished. They were accordingly razed to
the ground; the harbour was filled up; and the Duke
d'Aumont returned to Paris in the month of November.
The Queen, by her remonstrances to the court of Ver∣sailles,
had procured the enlargement of one hundred and
thirty-six protestants from the gallies: understanding af∣terwards
that as many more were detained on the same
account, she made such application to the French ministry,
that they too were released. Then she appointed General
Ross her envoy extraordinary to the King of France.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. The Duke of Shrewsbury being nominated
lord-lieutenant of Ireland, assembled the parliament of that
kingdom on the twenty-fifth day of November, and found
the two Houses still at variance, on the opposite principles
of Whig and Tory. Allen Broderick being chosen
speaker of the Commons, they ordered a bill to be brought
in, to attaint the Pretender and all his adherents. They
prosecuted Edward Lloyd, for publishing a book intituled,
“Memoirs of the Chevalier de St. George;” and they
agreed upon an address to the Queen, to remove from the
chancellorship Sir Constantine Phipps, who had counte∣nanced
the Tories of that kingdom. The Lords, how∣ever,
resolved, that Chancellor Phipps had, in his several
stations, acquitted himself with honour and integrity.
The two Houses of Convocation presented an address to
the same purpose. They likewise complained of Mr.
Molesworth, for having insulted them, by saying, when
they appeared in the castle of Dublin, “They that have
turned the world upside-down are come hither also;”
and he was removed from the privy-council. The Duke
of Shrewsbury received orders to prorogue this parliament,
which was divided against itself, and portended nothing
but domestick broils. Then he obtained leave to return
<PB N="250" REF="256"/>
to England, leaving Chancellor Phipps, with the Arch∣bishops
of Armagh and Tuam, justices of the kingdom.</P>
<P>§ XXX. The parliament of England had been dis∣solved;
and the elections were managed in such a man∣ner
as to retain the legislative power in the hands of the
Tories: but the meeting of the new parliament was de∣layed
by repeated prorogations to the tenth day of Decem∣ber;
a delay partly owing to the Queen's indisposition;
and partly to the contests among her ministers. Oxford
and Bolingbroke were competitors for power, and rivals in
reputation for ability. The Treasurer's parts were
deemed the more solid; the Secretary's more shining: but
both ministers were aspiring and ambitious. The first
was bent upon maintaining the first rank in the admini∣stration,
which he had possessed since the revolution in the
ministry: the other disdained to act as a subaltern to the
man whom he thought he excelled in genius, and equalled
in importance. They began to form separate cabals, and
adopt different principles. Bolingbroke insinuated himself
into the confidence of Lady Masham, to whom Oxford
had given some cause of disgust. By this communication
he gained ground in the good opinion of his sovereign,
while the Treasurer lost it in the same proportion. Thus
she who had been the author of his elevation was now
used as the instrument of his disgrace. The Queen was
sensibly affected with these diffentions, which she inter∣posed
her advice and authority, by turns, to appease: but
their mutual animosity continued to rankle under an en∣terior
accommodation. The interest of Bolingbroke was
powerfully supported by Sir Simon Harcourt, the chan∣cellor,
Sir William Wyndham, and Mr. Secretary Brom∣ley.
Oxford perceived his own influence was on the
wane, and began to think of retirement. Mean while,
the Earl of Peterborough was appointed ambassador to the
King of Sicily; and set out for Turin. The Queen
retired to Windsor, where she was seised with a very dan∣gerous
inflammatory fever. The hopes of the Jacobites
visibly rose: the publick funds immediately sell: a great
<PB N="251" REF="257"/>
run was made upon the Bank, the directors of which were
overwhelmed with consternation, which was not a little
increased by the report of an armament equipped in the
ports of France. They sent one of their members to re∣present
to the Treasure the danger that threatened the
publick credit. The Queen, being made acquainted with
these occurrences, signed a letter to Sir Samuel Stancer,
lord-mayor of London, declaring, that now she was re∣covered
of her late indisposition she would return to the
place of her usual residence, and open the parliament on
the sixteenth day of February. This intimation she sent
to her loving subjects of the city of London, to the intent
that all of them, in their several stations, might discoun∣tenance
those malicious rumours spread by evil-minded
persons, to the prejudice of credit, and the imminent
hazard of the publick peace and tranquillity. The Queen's
recovery, together with certain intelligence that the ar∣mament
was a phantom, and the Pretender still in Lor∣raine,
helped to assuage the ferment of the nation, which
had been industriously raised by party-writings. Mr. Ri∣chard
Steele published a performance, intituled “The
Crisis,” in defence of the Revolution and the protestant
establishment, and enlarging upon the danger of a popish
successor. On the other hand, the hereditary right of the
crown of England was asserted in a large volume, sup∣posed
to be written with a view to pave the way for the
Pretender's accession. One Bedford was apprehended,
tried, convicted, and severely punished, as the publisher of
this treatise.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. While England was harrassed by these in∣testine
commotions, the Emperor, rejecting the terms of
peace proposed by France, resolved to maintain the war
at his own expense, with the assistance of the empire. His
forces on the Rhine, commanded by Prince Eugene, were
so much outnumbered by the French under Villars, that
they could not prevent the enemy from reducing the two
important fortresses of Landau and Friburg. His Im∣perial
Majesty hoped that the death of Queen Anne, or
<PB N="252" REF="258"/>
that of Louis XIV. would produce an alteration in Europe
that might be favourable to his interest; and he depended
upon the conduct and fortune of Prince Eugene, for some
lucky event in war. But finding himself disappointed in
all these expectations, and absolutely unable to support
the expense of another campaign, he hearkened to over∣tures
of peace that were made by the Electors of Cologn
and Palatine; and conferences were opened at the castle
of Al-Rastadt, between Prince Eugene and Mareschal
de Villars, on the twenty-sixth day of November. In the
beginning of February, these ministers separated, without
seeming to have come to any conclusion; but all the ar∣ticles
being settled between the two courts of Vienna and
Versailles, they met again the latter end of the month:
the treaty was signed on the third day of March; and or∣ders
were sent to the governors and commanders on both
sides to desist from all hostilities. By this treaty, the
French King yielded to the Emperor Old Brisac, with all
its dependencies, Friburg, the forts in the Brisgau and
Black Forest, together with Fort Khel. He engaged to
demolish the fortifications opposite to Huningen, the fort
of Sellingen, and all between that and Fort Louis. The
town and fortress of Landau were ceded to the King of
France, who acknowledged the Elector of Hanover. The
Electors of Bavaria and Cologn were restored to all their
dignities and dominions. The Emperor was put in im∣mediate
possession of the Spanish Netherlands; and the
King of Prussia was permitted to retain the high quarter
of Gueldres. Finally, the contracting parties agreed that a
congress should be opened on the first of May, at Baden in
Switzerland, for terminating all differences; and Prince Eu∣gene
and Mareschal de Villars were appointed their first
plenipotentiaries.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. The ratifications of the treaty between Great-Britain
and Spain being exchanged, the peace was pro∣claimed
on the first day of March, in London; and the
articles were not disagreeable to the English nation. The
Kingdom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of France and Spain were separated for ever.
<PB N="253" REF="259"/>
Philip acknowledged the protestant succession, and re∣nounced
the Pretender. He agreed to a renewal of the
treaty of navigation and commerce concluded in the year
one thousand six hundred and sixty-seven. He granted an
exclusive privilege to the English for furnishing the Spa∣nish
West-Indies with negroes, according to the assiento
contract.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The assiento contract stipulated that from the first day of May, 1713, to the first of May, 1743, the company should transport into the West-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one hundred forty-four thousand negroes, at the rate of four thousand <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hundred negroes a year; and pay for each negro thirty-three pieces of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and one third, in full for all royal duties.</NOTE> He ceded Gibraltar to England, as well as
the island of Minorca, on condition that the Spanish in∣habitants
should enjoy their estates and religion. He obli∣ged
himself to grant a full pardon to the Catalonians, with
the possession of all their estates, honours, and privileges,
and to yield the kingdom of Sicily to the Duke of Savoy.
The new parliament was opened by commission in Febru∣ary,
and Sir Thomas Hanmer was chosen Speaker of the
House of Commons. On the second day of March, the
Queen being carried in a sedan to the House of Lords,
signified to both Houses, that she had obtained an honour∣able
and advantageous peace for her own people, and for
the greatest part of her allies; and she hoped her inter∣position
might prove effectual to complete the settlement
of Europe. She observed, that some persons had been so
malicious as to insinuate that the protestant succession in
the house of Hanover was in danger under her govern∣ment;
but that those who endeavoured to distract the
minds of men with imaginary dangers could only mean
to disturb the public tranquillity. She said, that after
all she had done to secure the religion and liberties of her
people, she could not mention such proceedings without
some degree of warmth; and she hoped her parliament
would agree with her, that attempts to weaken her autho∣rity,
or to render the possession of the crown uneasy to her,
could never be proper means to strengthen the protestant
succession. Affectionate addresses were presented by the
Lords, the Commons, and the Convocation; but the ill
<PB N="254" REF="260"/>
humour of party still subsisted, and was daily inflamed by
new pamphlets and papers. Steele, supported by Addison
and Hallifax, appeared in the front of those who drew their
pens in defence of Whig principles; and Swift was the
champion of the ministry.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. The Earl of Wharton complained in the
House of Lords of a libel intituled, “The publick spirit
of the Whigs set forth in their generous encourage∣ment
of the author of the Crisis.” It was a sarcastick
performance, imputed to Lord Bolingbroke and Swift,
interspersed with severe reflections upon the Union, the
Scottish nation, and the Duke of Argyle in particular.
The Lord-Treasurer disclaimed all knowledge of the au∣thor,
and readily concurred in an order for taking into
custody John Morphew, the publisher, as well as John
Barber, printer of the Gazette, from whose house the
copies were brought to Morphew. The Earl of Whartor
said it highly concerned the honour of that august assembly
to find out the villain who was author of that false and
scandalous libel, that justice might be done to the Scottish
nation. He moved, that Barber and his servants might be
examined; but, next day, the Earl of Mar, one of the
Secretaries of State, declared, that, in pursuance to he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Majesty's command, he had directed John Barber to be
prosecuted. Notwithstanding this interposition, which
was calculated to screen the offenders, the Lords presented
an address, beseeching her Majesty to issue out her roya<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
proclamation, promising a reward to any person who should
discover the author of the libel, which they conceived to be
false, malicious, and factious, highly dishonourable and
scandalous to her Majesty's subjects of Scotland, most inju∣rious
to her Majesty, and tending to the ruin of the consti∣tution.
In compliance with their request, a reward of three
hundred pounds was offered; but the author remained
safe from all detection.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. The Commons having granted the supplies
ordered a bill to be brought in for securing the freedom of
parliaments, by limiting the number of officers in the
<PB N="255" REF="261"/>
House of Commons; and it passed through both Houses
with little difficulty. In March, a complaint was made
of several scandalous papers lately published, under the name
of Richard Steele, Esquire, a member of the House. Sir
William Wyndham observed, that some of that author's
writings contained insolent, injurious reflections on the
Queen herself, and were dictated by the spirit of rebellion.
Steele was ordered to attend in his place: some paragraphs
of his works were read; and he answered them with an
affected air of self-confidence and unconcern. A day being
appointed for his trial, he acknowledged the writings, and
entered into a more circumstantial defence. He was assist∣ed
by Mr. Addison, General Stanhope, and Mr. Walpole;
and attacked by Sir William Wyndham, Mr. Foley, and
the Attorney-General. Whatever could be urged in his
favour was but little regarded by the majority, which voted,
that two pamphlets, entituled, “The Englishman, and the
Crisis,” written by Richard Steele, Esquire, were scandalous
and seditious libels; and that he should be expelled the
House of Commons.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. The Lords, taking into consideration the
state of the nation, resolved upon addresses to the Queen,
desiring they might know what steps had been taken for
removing the Pretender from the dominions of the Duke
of Lorraine: that she would impart to them a detail of the
negociations for peace; a recital of the instances which
had been made in favour of the Catalans; and an account
of the monies granted by parliament since the year one
thousand seven hundred and ten, to carry on the war in
Spain and Portugal. They afterwards agreed to other
addresses, beseeching her Majesty to lay before them the
debts and state of the navy, the particular writs of Noli
Prosequi granted since her accession to the throne; and a
list of such persons as, notwithstanding sentence of out∣lawry
or attainder, had obtained licences to return into
Great-Britain, or other of her Majesty's dominions, since the
Revolution. Having voted an application to the Queen
<PB N="256" REF="262"/>
in behalf of the distressed Catalans, the House adjourned
itself to the last day of March. As the minds of men had
been artfully irritated by false reports of a design undertaken
by France in behalf of the Pretender, the ambassador of
that crown at the Hague, disowned it in a publick paper,
by command of his Most Christian Majesty. The suspi∣cions
of many people, however, had been too deeply plant∣ed
by the arts and insinuations of the Whig leaders, to be
eradicated by this or any other declaration; and what
served to rivet their apprehensions, was a total removal of
the Whigs from all the employments, civil and military,
which they had hitherto retained. These were now be∣stowed
upon professed Tories, some of whom were attach∣ed
at bottom to the supposed heir of blood. At a time
when the Queen's views were maliciously misrepresented;
when the wheels of her government were actually impeded,
and her servants threatened with proscription by a power∣ful,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boyer.</NOTE>
turbulent, and implacable faction; no wonder that
she discharged the partisans of that faction from her service,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE>
and filled their places with those who were distinguished
by a warm affection to the house of Stuart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tindal.</NOTE> and by a sub∣missive
respect for the regal authority.<NOTE PLACE="marg">To<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cy.</NOTE> Those were steps
which her own sagacity must have suggested;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bolingbroke</NOTE> and which
her ministers would naturally advise as necessary for their
own preservation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Voltaire.</NOTE> The Whigs were all in commotion,
either apprehending, or affecting to apprehend, that a de∣sign
was formed to secure the Pretender's succession to the
throne of Great-Britain.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1714.</NOTE> Their chiefs held secret consul∣tations
with Baron Schutz, the resident from Hanover.
They communicated their observations to the Elector:
they received his instructions: they maintained a corre∣spondence
with the Duke of Marlborough; and they con∣certed
measures for opposing all efforts that might be made
against the protestant succession upon the death of the
Queen, whose health was by this time so much impaired,
that every week was believed to be the last of her life.
This conduct of the Whigs was resolute, active, and
would have been laudable, had their zeal been confined
<PB N="257" REF="263"/>
within the bounds of truth and moderation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XI. 1714.</NOTE> but they,
moreover, employed all their arts to excite and encourage
the fears and jealousies of the people.</P>
<P>§ XXXVI. The House of Peers resounded with debates
upon the Catalans, the Pretender, and the danger that
threatened the protestant succession. With respect to the
Catalonians, they represented, that Great-Britain had
prevailed upon them to declare for the house of Austria,
with promise of support; and that these engagements
ought to have been made good. Lord Bolingbroke de∣clared
that the Queen had used all her endeavours in their
behalf; and that her engagements with them subsisted no
longer than King Charles resided in Spain. They agreed,
however, to an address, acknowledging her Majesty's en∣deavours
in favour of the Catalans, and requesting she
would continue her interposition in their behalf. With
respect to the Pretender, the Whig lords expressed such a
spirit of persecution and rancorous hate, as would have
disgraced the members of any, even the lowest assembly
of Christians. Not contented with hunting him from one
country to another, they seemed eagerly bent upon extir∣pating
him from the face of the earth, as if they had
thought it was a crime in him to be born. The Earl
of Sunderland declared, from the information of the mi∣nister
of Lorraine, that, notwithstanding the application
of both Houses to her Majesty during the last session,
concerning the Pretender's being removed from Lorraine,
no instances had yet been made to the Duke for that pur∣pose.
Lord Bolingbroke affirmed that he himself had
made those instances, in the Queen's name, to that very
minister before his departure from England. The Earl of
Wharton proposed a question, “Whether the protestant
succession was in danger under the present administra∣tion?”
A warm debate ensued, in which the Arch∣bishop
of York and the Earl of Anglesey joined in the op∣position
to the ministry. The Earl pretended to be con∣vinced
and converted by the arguments used in the course
of the debate. He owned he had given his assent to the
<PB N="258" REF="264"/>
cessation of arms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1714.</NOTE> for which he took shame to himself,
asking pardon of God, his country, and his conscience.
He affirmed that the honour of his sovereign, and the good
of his country, were the rules of his actions; but that,
without respect of persons, should he find himself im∣posed
upon, he durst pursue an evil minister from the
Queen's closet to the Tower, and from the Tower to the
scaffold. This conversion, however, was much more
owing to a full persuasion that a ministry divided against
itself could not long subsist, and that the protestant suc∣cession
was firmly secured. He, therefore, resolved to make
a merit of withdrawing himself from the interests of a
tottering administration, in whose ruin he might be in∣volved.
The Duke of Argyle charged the ministers with
mal-administration, both within those walls and without:
he offered to prove that the Lord-Treasurer had yearly
remitted a sum of money to the Highland clans of Scot∣land,
who were known to be entirely devoted to the Pre∣tender.
He affirmed that the new modelling of the army,
the practice of disbanding some regiments out of their
turn, and removing a great number of officers, on account
of their affection to the House of Hanover, were clear in∣dications
of the ministry's designs; that it was a disgrace
to the nation to see men who had never looked an enemy
in the face advanced to the posts of several brave officers,
who, after they had often exposed their lives for their
country, were now starving in prison for debt, on account
of their pay's being detained. The Treasurer, laying his
hand upon his breast, said he had on so many occasions
given such signal proofs of affection to the protestant suc∣cession,
that he was sure no member of that august assem∣bly
did call it in question. He owned he had remitted,
for two or three years past, between three and four thou∣sand
pounds to the Highland clans; and he hoped the
House would give him an opportunity to clear his con∣duct
in that particular; with respect to the reformed of∣ficers,
he declared he had given orders for their being
<PB N="259" REF="265"/>
immediately paid. The protestant succession was voted out
of danger, by a small majority.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. Lord Hallifax proposed an address to the
Queen, that she would renew her instances for the speedy
removing the Pretender out of Lorraine; and that she
would, in conjunction with the States-General, enter into
the guarantee of the protestant succession in the House of
Hanover. The Earl of Wharton moved that in the ad∣dress
her Majesty should be desired to issue a proclamation,
promising a reward to any person who should apprehend
the Pretender dead or alive. He was seconded by the
Duke of Bolton; and the House agreed that an address
should be presented. When it was reported by the com∣mittee,
Lord North and Grey expatiated upon the bar∣barity
of setting a price on any one's head: He proved it
was an encouragement to murther and assassination; con∣trary
to the precepts of Christianity; repugnant to the
law of nature and nations; inconsistent with the dignity
of such an august assembly, and with the honour of a na∣tion
famed for lenity and mercy. He was supported by
Lord Trevor, who moved that the reward should be pro∣mised
for apprehending and bringing the Pretender to
justice, in case he should land or attempt to land in Great-Britain
or Ireland. The cruelty of the first clause was
zealously supported and vindicated by the Lords Cowper
and Hallifax; but by this time the Earl of Anglesey and
some others, who had abandoned the ministry, were brought
back to their former principles, by promise of profitable
employments; and the mitigation was adopted by a ma∣jority
of ten voices. To this address, which was delivered
by the Chancellor and the Whig lords only, the Queen
replied in these words: “My lords, it would be a real
strengthening to the succession in the House of Hanover,
as well as a support to my government, that an end
were put to those groundless sears and jealousies which
have been so industriously promoted. I do not at
this time see any occasion for such a proclamation.
Whenever I judge it to be necessary, I shall give my
<PB N="260" REF="266"/>
orders for having it issued. As to the other particulars
of this address, I will give proper directions therein.”
She was likewise importuned, by another address, to issue
out a proclamation against all jesuits, popish priests, and
bishops, as well as against all such as were outlawed for
adhering to the late King James and the Pretender. The
House resolved, That no person, not included in the ar∣ticles
of Limerick, and who had bor'n arms in France
and Spain, should be capable of any employment civil or
military: and that no person, a natural-born subject of
her Majesty, should be capable of sustaining the character
of a publick minister from any foreign potentate. These
resolutions were aimed at Sir Patrick Lawless, an Irish pa∣pist,
who had come to England with a credential letter from
King Philip, but now thought proper to quit the king∣dom.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. Then the lords in the opposition made
an attack upon the Treasurer, concerning the money he
had remitted to the Highlanders: but Oxford silenced his
opposers, by asserting, that in so doing he had followed
the example of King William, who, after he had reduced
that people, thought fit to allow yearly pensions to the
heads of clans, in order to keep them quiet. His conduct
was approved by the House; and Lord North and Grey
moved, that a day might be appointed for considering the
state of the nation, with regard to the treaties of peace
and commerce. The motion was seconded by the Earl of
Clarendon; and the thirteenth day of April fixed for this
purpose. In the mean time, Baron Schutz demanded of
the Chancellor a writ for the Electoral Prince of Hanover,
to sit in the House of Peers as Duke of Cambridge, in∣timating
that his design was to reside in England. The
writ was granted with reluctance; but the Prince's de∣sign
of coming to England was so disagreeable to the
Queen, that she signified her disapprobation of such a step
in a letter to the Princess Sophia. She observed that
such a method of proceeding would be dangerous to the
succession itself, which was not secure any other way,
<PB N="261" REF="267"/>
than as the prince who was in actual possession of the
throne maintained her authority and prerogative: she said
a great many people in England were seditiously disposed;
so she left her highness to judge what tumults they might
be able to raise should they have a pretext to begin a
commotion: she, therefore, persuaded herself that her aunt
would not consent to any thing which might disturb the
repose of her and her subjects. At the same time she wrote
a letter to the Electoral Prince, complaining that he had
formed such a resolution, without first knowing her sen∣timents
on the subject; and telling him plainly, that
nothing could be more dangerous to the tranquillity of her
dominions, to the right of succession in the Hanoverian
line, or more disagreeable to her, than such conduct at
this juncture. A third letter was written to the Elector,
his father; and the Treasurer took this opportunity to as∣sure
that prince of his inviolable attachment to the family
of Hanover.</P>
<P>§ XXXIX. The Whig lords were dissatisfied with the
Queen's answer to their address concerning the Pretender;
and they moved for another address on the same subject,
which was resolved upon, but never presented. They
took into consideration the treaties of peace and com∣merce,
to which many exceptions were taken; and much
sarcasm was expended on both sides of the dispute; but
at length the majority carried the question in favour of an
address, acknowledging her Majesty's goodness, in de∣livering
them, by a safe, honourable, and advantageous
peace with France, from the burthen of a consuming land-war,
unequally carried on, and become at last impracti∣cable.
The House of Commons concurred in this address,
after having voted that the protestant succession was out
of danger; but these resolutions were not taken without
violent opposition, in which General Stanhope, Mr. Lech∣mere,
and Mr. Walpole, chiefly distinguished themselves.
The letters which the Queen had written to the Electoral
house of Hanover were printed and published in England,
with a view to inform the friends of that family of the
<PB N="262" REF="268"/>
reasons which prevented the Duke of Cambridge from
executing his design of residing in Great Britain. The
Queen considered this step as a personal insult, as well as an
attempt to prejudice her in the opinions of her subjects;
she, therefore, ordered the publisher to be taken into custo∣dy.
At this period the Princess Sophia died, in the eighty-fourth
year of her age; and her death was intimated to the
Queen by Baron Bothmar, who arrived in England with
the character of envoy extraordinary from the Elector of
Hanover. This princess was the fourth and youngest daugh∣ter
of Frederick, Elector Palatine, King of Bohemia, and
Elizabeth, daughter of King James I. of England. She
enjoyed from nature an excellent capacity, which was sinely
cultivated; and was in all respects one of the most accom∣plished
princesses of the age in which she lived. At her
death the court of England appeared in mourning; and
the Elector of Brunswick was prayed for by name in the
liturgy of the church of England. On the twelfth day of
May, Sir William Wyndham made a motion for a bill to
prevent the growth of schism, and for the further security
of the church of England as by law established. The de∣sign
of it was to prohibit dissenters from teaching in schools
and academies. It was accordingly prepared, and eagerly
opposed in each House as a species of persecution. Never∣theless,
it made its way through both, and received the
royal assent; but the Queen dying before it took place, this
law was rendered ineffectual.</P>
<P>§ XL. Her Majesty's constitution was now quite broken;
one sit of sickness succeeded another; what completed the
ruin of her health was the anxiety of her mind, occa∣sioned
partly by the discontents which had been raised and
fomented by the enemies of her government; and partly
by the dissentions among her ministers, which were now
become intolerable. The council-chamber was turned
into a scene of obstinate dispute and bitter altereation.
Even in the Queen's presence the Treasurer and Secretary
did not abstain from, mutual obloquy and reproach.
<PB N="263" REF="269"/>
Oxford advised moderate measures, and is said to have
made advances towards a reconciliation with the leaders
of the Whig party. As he foresaw it would soon be
their turn to domineer, such precautions were necessary
for his own safety. Bolingbroke affected to set the
Whigs at defiance; he professed a warm zeal for the
church; he soothed the Queen's inclinations with the
most assiduous attention. He and his coadjutrix in∣sinuated,
that the Treasurer was biassed in favour of the
dissenters, and even that he acted as a spy for the house
of Hanover. In the midst of these disputes and commo∣tions
the Jacobites were not idle. They flattered them∣selves
that the Queen in secret favoured the preten∣sions
of her brother; and they depended upon Boling∣broke's
attachment to the same interest. They believed
the same sentiments were cherished by the nation in gene∣ral.
They held private assemblies both in Great-Britain
and in Ireland. They concerted measures for turning
the dissentions of the kingdom to the advantage of their
cause. They even proceeded so far as to inlist men for
the service of the Pretender. Some of these practices
were discovered by the Earl of Wharton, who did not fail
to sound the alarm. A proclamation was immediately
published, promising a reward of five thousand pounds
for apprehending the Pretender whenever he should land
or attempt to land in Great-Britain. The Commons
voted an address of thanks for the proclamation; and
assured her Majesty, that they would chearfully aid and
assist her, by granting the sum of an hundred thousand
pounds, as a further reward to any who should perform
so great a service to her Majesty and her kingdoms. The
Lords likewise presented an address on the same subject.
Lord Bolingbroke proposed a bill, decreeing the penalties
of high-treason against those who should list or be inlisted
in the Pretender's service. The motion was approved,
and the penalty extended to all those who should list or be
inlisted in the service of any foreign prince or state,
<PB N="264" REF="270"/>
without a licence under the sign manual of her Majesty,
her heirs, or successors.</P>
<P>§ XLI. On the second day of July, the Lords took into
consideration the treaty of commerce with Spain; and a
great number of merchants being examined at the bar of
the House, declared that unless the explanations of the
third, fifth, and eighth articles, as made at Madrid after
the treaty was signed, were rescinded, they could not carry
on their commerce without losing five-and-twenty per cent.
After a long debate, the House resolved to address the
Queen for all the papers relating to the negociation of
the treaty of commerce with Spain, with the names of the
persons who advised her Majesty to that treaty. To this
address she replied, that understanding the three explana∣tory
articles of the treaty were not detrimental to the
trade of her subjects, she had consented to their being
ratified with the treaty. The Earl of Wharton repre∣sented,
that if so little regard was shown to the addresses
of that august assembly to the sovereign, they had no busi∣ness
in that house. He moved for a remonstrance, to lay
before her Majesty the insuperable difficulties that at∣tended
the Spanish trade on the footing of the late treaty;
and the House agreed to his motion. Another member
moved, that the House should insist on her Majesty's
naming the persons who advised her to ratify the three
explanatory articles. This was a blow aimed at Arthur
Moore, a member of the Lower House, whom Lord Bo∣lingbroke
had consulted on the subject of the treaty. He
was screened by the majority in parliament; but a general
court of the South-Sea company resolved, upon a com∣plaint
exhibited by Captain Johnson, that Arthur Moore,
while a director, was privy to, and encouraged the design
of carrying on a clandestine trade, to the prejudice of the
corporation, contrary to his oath, and in breach of the
trust reposed in him; that, therefore, he should be declared
incapable of being a director of, or having any employ∣ment
in this company. The Queen had reserved to her∣self
<PB N="265" REF="271"/>
the quarter part of the assiento-contract, which she
now gave up to the company, and received the thanks of
the Upper House; but she would not discover the names
of those who advised her to ratify the explanatory articles.
On the ninth day of July, she thought proper to put an
end to the session, with a speech on the usual subjects.
After having assured them, that her chief concern was to
preserve the protestant religion, the liberty of her subjects,
and to secure the tranquillity of her kingdoms, she con∣cluded
in these words: “But I must tell you plainly,
that these desireable ends can never be obtained, unless
you bring the same dispositions on your parts, unless
all groundless jealousies, which create and foment divi∣sions
among you, be laid aside; and unless you show the
same regard for my just prerogative, and for the honour
of my government, as I have always expressed for the
rights of my people.”</P>
<P>§ XLII. After the peace had thus received the sanction
of the parliament, the ministers, being no longer restrained
by the tie of common danger, gave a loose to their mu∣tual
animosity. Oxford wrote a letter to the Queen,
containing a detail of the publick transactions; in the
course of which he endeavoured to justify his own con∣duct,
and expose the turbulent and ambitious spirit of his
rival. On the other hand, Bolingbroke charged the Trea∣surer
with having invited the Duke of Marlborough to
return from his voluntary exile; and maintained a pri∣vate
correspondence with the house of Hanover. The
Duke of Shrewsbury likewise complained of his having
presumed to send orders to him in Ireland, without the
privity of her Majesty and the council. In all probability
his greatest crime was his having given umbrage to the
favourite, Lady Masham. Certain it is, on the twenty-seventh
day of July, a very acrimonious dialogue passed
between that lady, the Chancellor, and Oxford, in the
Queen's presence. The Treasurer affirmed he had been
wronged, and abused by lies and misrepresentations; but
he threatened vengeance, declaring he would leave some
<PB N="266" REF="272"/>
people as low as he had found them when they first attract∣ed
his notice. In the mean time he was removed from his
employment; and Bolingbroke seemed to triumph in the
victory he had obtained. He laid his account with being
admitted as chief minister into the administration of affairs;
and is said to have formed the design of a coalition with
the Duke of Marlborough, who at this very time em∣barked
at Ostend for England. Probably, Oxford had
tried to play the same game, but met with a repulse from
the Duke, on account of the implacable resentment which
the Duchess had conceived against that minister.</P>
<P>§ XLIII. Whatever schemes might have been formed,
the fall of the Treasurer was so sudden, that no plan was
established for supplying the vacancy occasioned by his
disgrace. The confusion that incessantly ensued at court,
and the fatigue of attending a long cabinet-council on
this event, had such an effect upon the Queen's spirits
and constitution, that she declared she should not outlive
it, and was immediately seised with a lethargick disorder.
Notwithstanding all the medicines which the physicians
could prescribe, the distemper gained ground so fast, that
next day, which was the thirtieth of July, they despaired
of her life. Then the committee of the council assembled
at the Cockpit adjourned to Kensington. The Dukes of
Somerset and Argyle, informed of the desperate situation
in which she lay, repaired to the palace; and, without
being summoned, entered the council-chamber. The
members were surprised at their appearance; but the Duke
of Shrewsbury thanked them for their readiness to give
their assistance at such a critical juncture; and desired
they would take their places. The physicians having de∣clared
that the Queen was still sensible, the council unani∣mously
agreed to recommend the Duke of Shrewsbury as
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> person to fill the place of lord-treasurer. When
this opinion was intimated to the Queen, she said, they
could not have recommended a person she liked better
than the Duke of Shrewsbury. She delivered to him the
white staff, bidding him use it for the good of her people.
<PB N="267" REF="273"/>
He would have returned the lord-chamberlain's staff, but
she desired he would keep them both: so that he was at
one time possessed of the three greatest posts in the king∣dom,
under the titles of lord-treasurer, lord-chamberlain,
and lord-lieutenant of Ireland. No nobleman in England
better deserved such distinguishing marks of his sovereign's
favour. He was modest, liberal, disinterested, and a warm
friend to his country. Bolingbroke's ambition was de∣feated
by the vigour which the Dukes of Somerset and
Argyle exerted on this occasion. They proposed, that
all privy-counsellors in or about London should be in∣vited
to attend, without distinction of party. The motion
was approved; and Lord Somers, with many other Whig
members, repaired to Kensington. The council being thus
re-enforced began to provide for the security of the king∣dom.
Orders were immediately dispatched to four regi∣ments
of horse and dragoons quartered in remote counties,
to march up to the neighbourhood of London and West∣minster.
Seven of the ten British battalions in the Nether∣lands
were directed to embark at Ostend for England, with
all possible expedition: an embargo was laid upon all
shipping; and directions given for equipping all the ship<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of war that could be soonest in a condition for service.
They sent a letter to the Elector of Brunswick, signifying
that the physicians had despaired of the Queen's life; in∣forming
him of the measures they had taken; and desiring
he would, with all convenient speed, repair to Holland,
where he should be attended by a British squadron, to
convey him to England, in case of her Majesty's decease.
At the same time they dispatched instructions to the Earl
of Strafford, to desire the States-General would be ready
to perform the guarantee of the protestant succession.
The heralds at arms were kept in waiting, with a troop of
horse-guards, to proclaim the new king as soon as the
throne should become vacant. Precaustions were taken to
secure the sea-ports; to over-awe the Jacobites in Scotland;
and the command of the fleet was bestowed upon the Earl
of Berkeley.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="274"/>
§ XLIV. The Queen continued to doze in a lethargick
insensibility, with very short intervals, till the first day of
August in the morning, when she expired, in the fiftieth
year of her age, and in the thirteenth of her reign. Anne
Stuart, Queen of Great-Britain, was in her person of the
middle size, well proportioned. Her hair was of a dark
brown colour, her complexion ruddy, her features were
regular, her countenance was rather round than oval, and
her aspect more comely than majestick. Her voice was
clear and melodious, and her presence engaging. Her ca∣pacity
was naturally good, but not much cultivated by
learning; nor did she exhibit any marks of extraordinary
genius, or personal ambition. She was certainly deficient
in that vigour of mind by which a prince ought to pre∣serve
his independence, and avoid the snares and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
sycophants and favourites: but whatever her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
this particular might have been, the virtues of her heart
were never called in question. She was a pattern of con∣jugal
affection and fidelity, a tender mother, a warm friend,
an indulgent mistress, a munificent patron, a mild and
merciful prince, during whose reign no subject's blood was
shed for treason. She was zealously attached to the church
of England from conviction rather than from prepossession,
unaffectedly pious, just, charitable, and compassionate. She
felt a mother's fondness for her people, by whom she was
universally beloved with a warmth of affection which even
the prejudice of party could not abate. In a word, if
she was not the greatest, she was certainly one of the best
and most unblemished sovereigns that ever sat upon the
throne of England; and well deserved the expressive, though
simple epithet of “The good Queen Anne.”</P>

<PB N="270" REF="276"/>
<P>§ I. IT may be necessary to remind the reader of the
state of party at this important juncture. The
Jacobites had been fed with hopes of seeing the succession
altered by the Earl of Oxford. These hopes he had con∣veyed
to them in a distant, undeterminate, and mysterious
manner, without any other view than that of preventing
them from taking violent measures to embarrass his ad∣ministration.
At least, if he actually entertained at one
time any other design, he had, long before his disgrace,
laid it wholly aside, probably from an apprehension of the
danger with which it must have been attended; and seemed
bent upon making a merit of his zeal for the house of
Hanover: but his conduct was so equivocal and unsteady,
that he ruined himself in the opinion of one party, without
acquiring the confidence of the other. The friends of the
<PB N="271" REF="277"/>
Pretender derived fresh hopes from the ministry of Boling∣broke.
Though he had never explained himself on this
subject, he was supposed to favour the heir of blood, and
known to be an implacable enemy to the Whigs, who
were the most zealous advocates for the protestant suc∣cession.
The Jacobites promised themselves much from
his affection, but more from his resentment: and they
believed the majority of the Tories would join them on
the same maxims. All Bolingbroke's schemes of power
were defeated by the promotion of the Duke of Shrews∣bury
to the office of Treasurer; and all his hopes blasted
by the death of the Queen, on whose personal favour he
depended. The resolute behaviour of the Dukes of Somer∣set
and Argyle, together with the diligence and activity of
a council in which the Whig interest had gained the as∣cendency,
completed the confusion of the Tories, who
found themselves without a head, divided, distracted, and
irresolute. Upon recollection, they saw nothing so eligible
as silence, and submission to those measures which they
could not oppose with any prospect of success. They had
no other objection to the succession in the House of Hano∣ver,
but the fear of seeing the Whig faction once more
predominant: yet they were not without hope that their
new sovereign, who was reputed a prince of sagacity
and experience, would cultivate and conciliate the
affection of the Tories, who were the landholders and
proprietors of the kingdom, rather than declare himself
the head of a faction which leaned for support on those
who were enemies to the church and monarch, on the
Bank and the monied-interest, raised upon usury, and
maintained by corruption. In a word, the Whigs were
elated and overbearing; the Tories abashed and humble;
the Jacobites eager, impatient, and alarmed at a juncture
which, with respect to them, was truely critical.</P>
<P>§ II. The Queen had no sooner resigned her last breath,
than the privy-council met, and the Archbishop of Canter∣bury,
the Lord Chancellor, and the Hanoverian resident,
Kreyenberg, produced the three instruments in which the
<PB N="272" REF="278"/>
Elector of Brunswick had nominated the person<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These were the Dukes of Shrewsbury, Somerset, Bolton, Devonshire, Kent, Argyle, Montrose, and Roxburgh—the Earls of Pomsret, Anglesey, Carlisle, Nottingham, Abingdon, Scarborough, and O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ford—Lord Viscount Townshend, and Lords Hallifax and Cowper.</NOTE> to be
added as lords justices to the seven great officers of the
realm. Orders were immediately issued for proclaiming
King George, in England, Scotland, and Ireland. The
regency appointed the Earl of Dorset to carry to Hanover
the intimation of his Majesty's accession, and attend him
in his journey to England. They sent the general officers
in whom they could confide to their respective posts: they
re-enforced the garrison of Portsmouth: they appointed
Mr. Addison their secretary; while Bolingbroke was
obliged to stand at the door of the council-chamber with
his bag and papers, and underwent every species of morti∣fication.
On the whole, King George ascended the throne
of Great-Britain in the fifty-fifth year of his age, without
the least opposition, tumult, or sign of popular discontent;
and the unprejudiced part of the nation was now fully
persuaded that no design had ever been concerted by Queen
Anne and her ministry in favour of the Pretender. The
Mayor of Oxford received a letter, requiring him to pro∣claim
the Pretender. This being communicated to the
Vice-Chancellor, a copy of it was immediately transmitted
to Mr. Secretary Bromley, member of parliament for the
University; and the Vice-Chancellor offered a reward of
one hundred pounds to any person who should discover
the author. It was either the production of some luna∣tick,
or a weak contrivance to fix an odium on that venera∣ble
body.</P>
<P>§ III. The parliament having assembled, pursuant to the
act which regulated the succession, the Lord Chancellor,
on the fifth day of August, made a speech to both Houses
in the name of the regency. He told them, that the privy-council
appointed by the Elector of Brunswick had pro∣claimed
that prince under the name of King George, as
the lawful and rightful sovereign of these kingdoms; and
that they had taken the necessary care to maintain the
<PB N="273" REF="279"/>
publick peace. He observed, that the several branches of
the publick revenue were expired by the demise of her late
Majesty: and recommended to the Commons the making
such provision in that respect as might be requisite to sup∣port
the honour and dignity of the crown. He likewise
expressed his hope, that they would not be wanting in any
thing that might conduce to the establishing and advancing
of the publick credit. Both Houses immediately agreed to
addresses, containing the warmest expressions of duty and
affection to their new sovereign, who did not fail to return
such answers as were very agreeable to the parliament of
Great-Britain. In the mean time, the Lower House pre∣pared
and passed a bill, granting to his Majesty the same
civil-list which the Queen had enjoyed; with additional
clauses for the payment of arrears due to the troops of
Hanover, which had been in the service of Great-Britain;
and for a reward of one hundred thousand pounds, to be
paid by the Treasury to any person who should apprehend
the Pretender in landing, or in attempting to land, in any
part of the British dominions. Mr. Craggs, who had
been dispatched to Hanover before the Queen died, return∣ing
on the thirteenth day of August, with letters from the
King to the regency, they went to the House of Peers:
then the Chancellor, in another speech to both Houses,
intimated his Majesty's great satisfaction in the loyalty
and affection which his people had universally expressed
at his accession. Other addresses were voted on this oc∣casion.
The Commons finished the bill for the civil-list,
and one for making some alterations in an act for a state
lottery, which received the royal assent from the lords
justices. Then the parliament was prorogued.</P>
<P>§ IV. Mr. Prior having notified the Queen's death to
the court of Versailles, Louis declared that he would in∣violably
maintain the treaty of peace concluded at Utrecht,
particularly with relation to the settlement of the British
crown in the house of Hanover. The Earl of Strafford
having signified the same event to the States of Holland;
and the resident of Hanover having presented them with a
<PB N="274" REF="280"/>
letter, in which his master claimed the performance of
their guarantee, they resolved to perform their engage∣ments,
and congratulated his Electoral Highness on his
accession to the throne of Great-Britain. They invited
him to pass through their dominions; and assured him that
his interests were as dear to them as their own. The
Chevalier St. George no sooner received the news of
the Queen's death, than he posted to Versailles, where he
was given to understand, that the King of France ex∣pected
he should quit his territories immediately; and he
was accordingly obliged to return to Lorraine. By this
time Mr. Murray had arrived in England from Hano∣ver,
with notice that the King had deferred his departure
for some days. He brought orders to the regency to pre∣pare
a patent for creating the Prince-Royal Prince of
Wales; and for removing Lord Bolingbroke from his post
of secretary. The seals were taken from this minister by
the Dukes of Shrewsbury and Somerset, and Lord Cow∣per,
who at the same time sealed up all the doors of his
office.</P>
<P>§ V. King George having vested the government of his
German dominions in a council, headed by his brother
Prince Ernest, set out with the Electoral Prince from
Herenhausen on the thirty-first day of August; and in five
days arrived at the Hague, where he conferred with the
States-General. On the sixteenth day of September
he embarked at Orange-Polder, under convoy of an En∣glish
and Dutch squadron, commanded by the Earl of
Berkeley; and next day arrived at the Hope. In the after∣noon
the yacht sailed up the river; and his Majesty, with
the Prince, were landed from a barge at Greenwich, about
six in the evening. There he was received by the Duke
of Northumberland, captain of the life-guards, and the
lords of the regency. From the landing-place he walked
to his house in the Park, accompanied by a great number
of the nobility, and other persons of distinction, who had
the honour to kiss his hand, as they approached. When
he retired to his bed-chamber, he sent for those of the
<PB N="275" REF="281"/>
nobility who had distinguished themselves by their zeal for
his succession: but the Duke of Ormond, the Lord Chan∣cellor,
and Lord Trevor were not of the number. Next
morning, the Earl of Oxford presented himself with an
air of confidence, as if he had expected to receive some
particular mark of his Majesty's favour: but he had the
mortification to remain a considerable time undistinguished
among the croud; and then was permitted to kiss the
King's hand, without being honoured with any other
notice. On the other hand, his Majesty expressed un∣common
regard for the Duke of Marlborugh, who had
lately arrived in England, as well as for all the leaders of
the Whig party.</P>
<P>§ VI. It was the misfortune of this prince, as well as
a very great prejudice to the nation, that he had been
misled into strong prepossessions against the Tories, who
constituted such a considerable part of his subjects. They
were now excluded from all share of the royal favour,
which was wholly engrossed by their enemies: these early
marks of aversion, which he was at no pains to conceal,
alienated the minds of many from his person and govern∣ment,
who would otherwise have served him with fidelity
and affection. An instantaneous and total change was
effected in all offices of honour and advantage. The
Duke of Ormond was dismissed from his command, which
the King restored to the Duke of Marlborough, whom
he likewise appointed colonel of the first regiment of foot∣guards,
and master of the Ordnance. The great seal
was given to Lord Cowper; the privy seal to the
Earl of Wharton; the government of Ireland to the Earl
of Sunderland. The Duke of Devonshire was made
steward of the household: Lord Townshend and Mr.
Stanhope were appointed secretaries of state: the post of
secretary for Scotland was bestowed upon the Duke of
Montrose. The Duke of Somerset was constituted ma∣ster
of the horse: the Duke of St. Alban's captain of the
band of pensioners; and the Duke of Argyle commander
in chief of the forces in Scotland. Mr. Pulteney
<PB N="276" REF="282"/>
became secretary at war; and Mr. Walpole, who had al∣ready
undertaken to manage the House of Commons, was
gratified with the double place of paymaster to the army
and to Chelsea-hospital. A new privy-council was ap∣pointed,
and the Earl of Nottingham declared president:
but all affairs of consequence were concerted by a cabinet-council,
or junto, composed of the Duke of Marlborough,
the Earls of Nottingham and Sunderland, the Lords Hal∣lifax,
Townshend, and Somers, and General Stanhope.
The regency had already removed Sir Constantine Phipps
and the Archbishop of Armagh from the office of lords
justices in Ireland, and filled their places in the regency of
that kingdom with the Archbishop of Dublin and the Earl
of Kildare. Allan Broderick was appointed chancellor:
another privy-council was formed; and the Duke of Or∣mond
was named as one of the members. The Treasury
and Admiralty were put into commission: all the govern∣ments
were changed; and, in a word, the whole nation
was delivered into the hands of the Whigs. At the same
time, the Prince-Royal was declared Prince of Wales,
and took his place in council. The King was congratu∣lated
on his accession in addresses from the two universities,
and from all the cities and corporations in the kingdom.
He expressed particular satisfaction at these expressions of
loyalty and affection. He declared in council his firm
purpose to support and maintain the churches of England
and Scotland as they were by law established. An aim
which he imagined might be effectually accomplished,
without impairing the toleration allowed by law to pro∣testant
dissenters, and so necessary to the trade and riches
of the kingdom: he, moreover, assured them he would
earnestly endeavour to render property secure; the good
effects of which were no where so clearly seen as in this
happy nation. Before the coronation he created some new
peers, and others were promoted to higher titles.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James, Lord Chandos, was created Earl of Caerna<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>von—Lewis, Lord Rockingham, Earl of that name—Charles, Lord Ossulton, Earl of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>∣ville—Charles, Lord Hallifax, Earl of Hallifax—Heneage, Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Earl of Aylesford—John, Lord Hervey, Earl of Bristol—Thomas, Lord Pel∣ham, Earl of Clare—Henry, Earl of Thomond, in Ireland, Viscount Tad∣caster—James, Viscount Castleton, in Ireland, Baron Sanderson—Bennet, Lord She<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ard, in Ireland, Baron of Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>borough—Gervase, Lord Pierrepoint, in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leand, Baron P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>epoint, in the county of Bucks—Henry Boyle, Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arleton, in the county of York—Sir Richard Temple, Baron of Cobh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m.—Henry, Lord Paget Earl of U<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bridge.</NOTE>. On
<PB N="277" REF="283"/>
the twentieth day of October, he was crowned in West∣minster
with the usual solemnity, at which the Earl of
Oxford and Lord Bolingbroke assisted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the month of October, the Princess of Wales arrived in England, with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r two eldest daughters, the Princesses Anne and Amelia.</NOTE>. On that very
day, the university of Oxford, in full convocation, unani∣mously
conferred the degree of doctor of civil law on Sir
Constantine Phipps, with particular marks of honour and
esteem. As the French King was said to protract the de∣molition
of Dunkirk, Mr. Prior received orders to pre∣sent
a memorial to hasten this work, and to prevent the
canal of Mardyke from being finished. The answer which
he received being deemed equivocal, this minister was re∣called,
and the Earl of Stair appointed ambassador to the
court of France, where he prosecuted this affair with un∣common
vigour. About the same time, General Cadogan
was sent as plenipotentiary to Antwerp, to assist at the
barrier-treaty, negociated there between the Emperor and
the States-General.</P>
<P>§ VII. Mean while, the number of the malcontents in
England was considerably increased by the King's attach∣ment
to the Whig faction. The clamour of the church's
being in danger was revived; jealousies were excited;
seditious libels dispersed; and dangerous tumults raised
in different parts of the kingdom. Birmingham, Bristol,
Chippenham, Norwich, and Reading were filled with
licentious riot. The party cry was, “Down with
the Whigs! Sacheverel for ever!” Many gentlemen
of the Whig faction were abused; magistrates in towns,
and justices in the country, were reviled and insulted by
the populace in the execution of their office. The Pre∣tender
took this opportunity to transmit, by the French
mail, copies of a printed manifesto to the Dukes of
<PB N="278" REF="284"/>
Shrewsbury, Marlborough, Argyle, and other noblemen
of the first distinction. In this declaration, he mentioned
the good intentions of his sister towards him, which were
prevented by her deplorable death. He observed that his
people, instead of doing him and themselves justice, had
proclaimed for their king a foreign prince, contrary to the
fundamental and incontestable laws of hereditary right,
which their pretended acts of settlement could never ab∣rogate.
These papers being delivered to the secretaries of
state, the King refused an audience to the Marquis de
Lamberti, minister from the Duke of Lorraine, on the sup∣position
that this manifesto could not have been prepared
or transmitted without the knowledge and countenance
of his master. The Marquis having communicated this
circumstance to the Duke, that prince absolutely denied
his having been privy to the transaction, and declared that
the Chevalier de St. George came into Lorraine by the
directions of the French King, whom the Duke could
not disoblige without exposing his territories to invasion.
Notwithstanding this apology, the Marquis was given to
understand, that he could not be admitted to an audience
until the Pretender should be removed from the dominions
of his master: he, therefore, quitted the kingdom without
further hesitation. Religion was still mingled in all po∣litical
disputes. The high-church-men complained th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
impiety and heresy daily gained ground, from the con∣nivance,
or at least the su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine negligence of the Whig
prelates. The Lower House of Convocation had, before
the Queen's death, declared that a book published by Dr.
Samuel Clarke, under the title of “The Scripture-Doctrine
of the Trinity,” contained assertions contrary
to the catholick saith. They sent up extracts from this
performance to the bishops; and the Doctor wrote an
answer to their objections. He was prevailed upon to
write an apology, which he presented to the Upper House:
but apprehending it might be published separately, and
misunderstood, he afterwards delivered an explanation to the
the Bishop of London. This was satisfactory to the
<PB N="279" REF="285"/>
bishops; but the Lower House resolved, that it was no re∣cantation
of his heretical assertions. The disputes about the
Trinity increasing, the archbishops and bishops received di∣rections,
which were published, for preserving unity in the
church, the purity of the christian faith concerning the holy
Trinity, and for maintaining the peace and quiet of the
state. By these every preacher was restricted from deliver∣ing
any other doctrine than what is contained in the holy
scriptures with respect to the Trinity; and from intermed∣dling
in any affairs of state or government. The like pro∣hibition
was extended to those who should write, harangue,
or dispute on the same subjects.</P>
<P>§ VIII. The parliament being dissolved, another was
called by a very extraordinary proclamation, in which the
King complained of the evil designs of men disaffected to
his succession; and of their having misrepresented his
conduct and principles. He mentioned the perplexity of
publick affairs, the interruption of commerce, and the
heavy debts of the nation. He expressed his hope that his
loving subjects would send up to parliament the fittest per∣sons
to redress the present disorders; and that, in the
elections, they would have a particular regard to such as
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad expressed a firm attachment to the protestant succession
when it was in danger. It does not appear that the pro∣testant
succession was ever in danger. How then was this
declaration to be interpreted? People in general con∣strued
it into a design to maintain party-distinctions, and
encourage the Whigs to the full exertion of their influ∣ence
in the elections; into a renunciation of the Tories;
and as the first slash of that vengeance which afterwards
was seen to burst upon the heads of the late ministry.
When the Earl of Strafford returned from Holland, all
his papers were seised by an order from the secretary's
office. Mr. Prior was recalled from France, and promised
to discover all he knew relating to the conduct of Ox∣ford's
administration. Uncommon vigour was exerted on
both sides in the elections; but, by dint of the monied-in∣terest,
<PB N="280" REF="286"/>
which prevailed in most of the corporations through
the kingdom, and the countenance of the ministry, which
will always have weight with needy and venal electors, a
great majority of Whigs was returned both in England and
Scotland.</P>
<P>§ IX. When this new parliament assembled on the
seventeenth day of March at Westminster, Mr. Spencer
Compton was chosen Speaker of the Commons. On the
twenty-first day of the month, the King appeared in the
House of Lords, and delivered to the Chancellor a written
speech, which was read in presence of both Houses. His
Majesty thanked his faithful and loving subjects for that
zeal and firmness they had shown in defence of the pro∣testant
succession, against all the open and secret practices
which had been used to defeat it. He told them, that
some conditions of the peace, essential to the security and
trade of Great-Britain, were not yet duly executed; and
that the performance of the whole might be looked upon
as precarious, until defensive alliances should be formed
to guarantee the present treaties. He observed that the
Pretender boasted of the assistance he expected in England,
to repair his former disappointments: that great part of
the national trade was rendered impracticable: and that the
publick debts were surprisingly increased, even since the
fatal cessation of arms. He gave the Commons to under∣stand,
that the branches of the revenue formerly granted
for the support of the civil government were so far en∣cumbered
and alienated, that the produce of the funds
which remained, and had been granted to him, would fall
short of what was at first designed for maintaining the
honour and dignity of the crown: that as it was his, and
their happiness to see a Prince of Wales who might in due
time succeed him on the throne; and to see him blessed
with many children; these circumstances would naturally
occasion an expense to which the nation had not been for
many years accustomed; and, therefore, he did not doubt
but they would think of it with that assection which he
had reason to hope from his Commons. He desired that
<PB N="281" REF="287"/>
no unhappy divisions of parties might divert them from pur∣suing
the common interest of their country. He declared
that the established constitution in church and state should
be the rule of his government; and that the happiness, ease,
and prosperity, of his people should be the chief care of his
life. He concluded with expressing his confidence, that
with their assistance he should disappoint the designs of
those who wanted to deprive him of that blessing which he
most valued, the affection of his people.</P>
<P>§ X. Speeches suggested by a vindictive ministry better
became the leader of an incensed party, than the father
and sovereign of a divided people. This declaration por∣tended
measures which it was the interest of the crown to
avoid, and suited the temper of the majority in both Houses,
which breathed nothing but destruction to their political
adversaries. The Lords, in their address of thanks, pro∣fessed
their hope that his Majesty, assisted by the parliament,
would be able to recover the reputation of the kingdom in
foreign parts, the loss of which they hoped to convince the
world by their actions was by no means to be imputed to
the nation in general. The Tories said this was an in∣vidious
reflection, calculated to mislead and inflame the
people; for the reputation of the kingdom had never been
so high as at this very juncture. The Commons pretended
astonishment to find that any conditions of the late peace
should not yet be duly executed; and that care was not
taken to form such alliances as might have rendered the
peace not precarious. They declared their resolution to
enquire into these fatal miscarriages; to trace out those
measures whereon the Pretender placed his hopes, and
bring the authors of them to condign punishment. These
addresses were not voted without opposition. In the House
of Lords, the Dukes of Buckingham and Shrewsbury,
the Earl of Anglesey, the Archbishop of York, and other
peers, both secular and ecclesiastical, observed, that their
address was injurious to the late Queen's memory, and
would serve only to increase those unhappy divisions that
distracted the kingdom. In the Lower House, Sir William
<PB N="282" REF="288"/>
Wyndham, Mr. Bromley, Mr. Shippin, General Ross, Sir
William Whitelock, and other members, took exceptions
to passages of the same nature, in the address which the
Commons had prepared. They were answered by Mr.
Walpole, Mr. Pulteney, and Mr. Secretary Stanhope.
These gentlemen took occasion to declare, that, notwith∣standing
the endeavours which had been used to prevent a
discovery of the late mismanagements, by conveying away
several papers from the secretary's office, yet the govern∣ment
had sufficient evidence left, to prove the late ministry
the most corrupt that ever sat at the helm: that those mat∣ters
would soon be laid before the House, when it would
appear that a certain English general had acted in concert
with, if not received orders from, Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hal de Villars.
Lord Bolingbroke, who had hitherto appeared in publick,
as usual, with remarkable serenity, and spoke in the House
of Lords with great freedom and confidence, thought it
was now high time to consult his personal safety.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bover.</NOTE> He ac∣cordingly
withdrew to the continent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tindal.</NOTE> leaving a letter which
was afterwards printed in his justification.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.</NOTE> In this paper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bolingbroke</NOTE>
he declared he had received certain and repeated informa∣tions
that a resolution was taken to pursue him to the scaf∣fold:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Voltaire.</NOTE>
that if there had been the least reason to hope for a
fair and open tryal, after having been already prejudged,
unheard, by the two Houses of parliament, he should not
have declined the strictest examination. He challenged the
most invet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ate of his enemies to produce any one instance
of criminal correspondence, or the least corruption in any
part of the administration in which he was concerned. He
said, if his zeal for the honour and dignity of his royal
mistress, and the true interest of his country, bad any where
transported him to let slip a warm and unguarded expres∣sion,
he hoped the most favourable interpretation would be
put upon it. He affirmed that he had seved her Majesty
faithfully and dutifully, in that especially which she had
most at heart, relieving her people from a bloody and ex∣pensive
war; and that he had always been too much an
<PB N="283" REF="289"/>
Englishman to sacrifice the interest of his country to any
foreign ally whatsoever.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. I. An. 1715.</NOTE></P>
<P>§ XI. In the midst of all this violence against the late mi∣nisters,
friends were not wanting to espouse their cause in
the face of opposition; and even in some addresses to the
King their conduct was justified. Nay, some individuals
had courage enough to attack the present administration.
When a motion was made in the House of Commons, to
consider the King's proclamation for calling a new parlia∣ment,
Sir William Whitelocke, member for the university
of Oxford, boldly declared it was unprecedented and un∣warrantable.
Being called upon to explain himself, he
made an apology. Nevertheless, Sir William Wyndham
rising up, said the proclamation was not only unprecedented
and unwarrantable, but even of dangerous consequence to
the very being of parliaments. When challenged to jus∣tify
his charge, he observed, that every member was free to
speak his thought. Some exclaimed, “The Tower!
the Tower! A warm debate ensued; Sir William being
ordered to withdraw, was accompanied by one hundred
and twenty-nine members; and those who remained in the
House resolved, That he should be reprimanded by the
Speaker. He was accordingly rebuked, for having pre∣sumed
to reflect on his Majesty's proclamation, and having
made an unwarrantable use of the freedom of speech
granted by his Majesty. Sir William said he was not con∣scious
of having offered any indignity to his Majesty, or of
having been guilty of a breach of privilege: that he acqui∣esced
in the determination of the House; but had no thanks
to give to those gentlemen who, under pretence of lenity,
had subjected him to this censure.</P>
<P>§ XII. On the ninth day of April, General Stanhope
delivered to the House of Commons fourteen volumes,
consisting of all the papers relating to the late negociations
of peace and commerce, as well as to the cessation of arms;
and moved that they might be referred to a select com∣mittee
of twenty persons, who should digest the substance
<PB N="284" REF="290"/>
of them under proper heads,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1715.</NOTE> and report them, with their
observations to the House. One more was added to the
number of this secret committee, which was chosen by
ballot; and met that same evening. Robert Walpole,
original chairman, being taken ill, was succeeded in that
place by Mr. Stanhope. The whole number was sub∣divided
into three committees: to each a certain number
of books was allotted; and they carried on the enquiry
with great eagerness and expedition. Before this measure
was taken, Dr. Gilbert Burnet, Bishop of Sarum, died of a
pleuritick fever, in the seventy-second year of his age:
immediately after the committee had begun to act, the
Whig party lost one of their warmest champions, by the
death of the Marquis of Wharton, a nobleman possessed
of happy talents for the cabinet, the senate, and the com∣mon
scenes of life; talents, which a life of pleasure and li∣bertinism
did not prevent him from employing with sur∣prising
vigour and application. The committee of the
Lower House taking the civil-list into consideration, ex∣amined
several papers relating to that revenue. The To∣ries
observed, that from the seven hundred thousand pounds
granted annually to King William, fifty thousand pounds
were allotted to the late Queen, when Princess of Denmark;
twenty thousand pounds to the Duke of Gloucester; and
twice that sum as a dowry to James's Queen: that near
two hundred thousand pounds had been yearly deducted
from the revenues of the late Queen's civil-list, and ap∣plied
to other uses; notwithstanding which deduction,
she had honourably maintained her family, and supported
the dignity of the crown. In the course of the debate
some warm altercation passed between Lord Guernsey and
one of the members, who affirmed that the late ministry
had used the Whigs, and, indeed, the whole nation in
such a manner, that nothing they should suffer could be
deemed a hardship. At length, the House agreed that the
sum of seven hundred thousand pounds clear should be
granted for the civil-list during his Majesty's life. A
motion being made for an address against pensions, it was
<PB N="285" REF="291"/>
opposed by Mr. Walpole, and over-ruled by the majority.
The Lords passed the bill for regulating the land-forces,
with some amendments.</P>
<P>§ XIII. On the eighteenth day of May, Sir John Norris
failed with a strong squadron to the Baltick, in order to
protect the commerce of the nation, which had suffered
from the King of Sweden, who caused all ships trading to
those parts to be seised and confiscated. That prince had
rejected the treaty of neutrality concerted by the allies for
the security of the empire; and considered the English and
Dutch as his enemies. The ministers of England and the
States-General had presented memorials to the regency of
Sweden; but finding no redress, they resolved to protect
their trade by force of arms. After the Swedish general
Steenboch and his army were made prisoners, Count
Wellen concluded a treaty with the administrator of Hol∣stein-Gottorp,
by which the towns of Stetin and Wismar
were sequestered into the hands of the King of Prussia.
The administrator engaged to secure them, and all the rest
of Swedish Pomerania, from the Poles and Muscovites;
but, as the governor of Pomerania refused to comply with
this treaty, those allies marched into the province, subdued
the island of Rugen, and obliged Stetin to surrender.
Then the governor consented to the sequestration, and paid
to the Poles and Muscovites four hundred thousand rix∣dollars,
to indemnify them for the expense of the siege.
The King of Sweden returning from Turkey, rejected the
treaty of sequestration, and insisted upon Stetin's being
restored, without his repaying the money. As this mo∣narch
likewise threatened to invade the electorate of
Saxony, and chastise his false friends, King George, for
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he security of his German dominions, concluded a treaty
with the King of Denmark; by which the duchies of
Bremen and Verden, which had been taken from the
Swede in his absence, were made over to his Britannick
Majesty, on condition that he should immediately declare
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar against Sweden. Accordingly, he took possession of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he duchies in October; published a declaration of war
<PB N="286" REF="292"/>
against Charles in his German dominions; and detached
six thousand Hanoverians to join the Danes and Prussians
in Pomerania. These allies reduced the islands of Rugen
and Uledon, and attacked the towns of Wismar and
Stralsund, from which last place Charles was obliged to
retire in a vessel to Schonen. He assembled a body of
troops, with which he proposed to pass the Sound upon
the ice, and attack Copenhagen; but was disappointed by
a sudden thaw. Nevertheless, he refused to return to Stock∣holm,
which he had not seen for sixteen years; but remain∣ed
at Carlescroon, in order to hasten his fleet for the relief
of Wismar.</P>
<P>§ XIV. The spirit of discontent and disaffection seemed
to gain ground every day in England. Notwithstanding
proclamations against riots, and orders of the justices for
maintaining the peace, repeated tumults were raised by the
malcontents in the cities of London and Westminster.
Those who celebrated the anniversary of the king's birth∣day
with the usual marks of joy and festivity were in∣sulted
by the populace; but, next day, which was the
anniversary of the restoration, the whole city was lighted
up with bonfires and illuminations, and echoed with the
sound of mirth and tumultuous rejoicing. The people
even obliged the life-guards who patroled through the
streets, to join in the cry of “High-church and Ormond!”
and in Smithfield they burned a picture of King William.
Thirty persons were imprisoned for being concerned in
these riots. One Bournois, a schoolmaster, who affirmed
that King George had no right to the crown, was tried,
and scourged through the city, with such severity, that in
a few days he expired in the utmost torture. A frivolous
incident served to increase the popular ferment. The
shirts allowed to the first regiment of guards, commanded
by the Duke of Marlborough, were so coarse, that the
soldiers could hardly be persuaded to wear them. Some
were thrown into the garden of the King's palace, and
into that which belonged to the Duke of Marlborough.
A detachment, in marching through the city, produced
<PB N="287" REF="293"/>
them to the view of the shopkeepers and passengers, ex∣claiming,
“These are the Hanover shirts.” The court
being informed of this clamour, ordered those new shirts
to be burned immediately: but even this sacrifice, and an
advertisement published by the Duke of Marlborough in
his own vindication, did not acquit that general of a sus∣picion
that he was concerned in this mean species of pecu∣lation.
A reward of fifty pounds was offered by the go∣vernment
to any person that would discover one Captain
Wight, who, by an intercepted letter, appeared to be
disaffected to King George; and Mr. George Jefferies was
seised at Dublin, with a packet directed to Dr. Jonathan
Swift, Dean of St. Patrick's. Several treasonable papers
being found in this packet, were transmitted to England:
Jefferies was obliged to give bail for his appearance; and
Swift thought proper to abscond.</P>
<P>§ XV. The House of Lords, to demonstrate their abhor∣rence
of all who should engage in conspiracies against their
sovereign, rejected with indignation a petition presented
to them in behalf of Blackburn, Cassils, Bernarde, Mel∣drum,
and Chambers, who had hitherto continued pri∣soners,
for having conspired against the life of King
William. On the ninth day of June, Mr. Walpole, as
chairman of the secret committee, declared to the House
of Commons, that the report was ready; and in the
mean time moved, That a warrant might be issued by Mr.
Speaker for apprehending several persons, particularly Mr.
Matthew Prior and Mr. Thomas Harley, who being in
the House, were immediately taken into custody. Then
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e recited the report, ranged under these different heads:
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he clandestine negociation with Monsieur Menager: the
extraordinary measures pursued to form the congress at
Utrecht: the trisling of the French plenipotentiaries, by
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he connivance of the British ministers: the negociation
about the renunciation of the Spanish monarchy: the fatal
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>spension of arms: the seizure of Ghent and Bruges, in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>der to distress the allies and favour the French: the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uke of Ormond's acting in concert with the French
<PB N="288" REF="294"/>
general: the Lord Bolingbroke's journey to France, to ne∣gociate
a separate peace: Mr. Prior's and the Duke of
Shrewsbury's negociation in France: the precipitate con∣clusion
of the peace at Utrecht. The report being read,
Sir Thomas Hanmer moved, That the consideration of it
should be adjourned to a certain day; and that in the mean
time the report should be printed for the perusal of the
members: he was seconded by the Tories: a debate ensued;
and the motion was rejected by a great majority.</P>
<P>§ XVI. This point being gained, Mr. Walpole im∣peached
Henry Lord Viscount Bolingbroke of high-treason,
and other high crimes and misdemeanours. Mr. Hunger∣ford
declared his opinion, that nothing mentioned in the
report, in relation to Lord Bolingbroke, amounted to high∣treason;
and General Ross expressed the same sentiment.
Then Lord Coningsby standing up, “The worthy chair∣man
(said he) ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> impeached the hand, but I impeach
the head: he has impeached the clerk, and I the justice:
he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> impeached the scholar, and I the master. I
impeach Robert Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer
of high-treason, and other crimes and misdemeanours.”
Mr. Auditor Harley, Earl's brother, spoke in vindi∣cation
of that minister. He affirmed he had done nothing
but by the immediate command of his sovereign: that the
peace was a good peace, and approved as such by two par∣liaments;
and that the facts charged to him in the report
amounted only to misdemeanours: if the sanction of a par∣liament,
which is the representative and legislature of the
nation, be not sufficient to protect a minister from the
vengeance of his enemies, he can have no security. Mr.
Auditor Foley, the Earl's brother-in-law, made a speech
to the same purpose: Sir Joseph Jekyll, a staunch Whig,
and member of the secret committee, expressed his doubt,
whether they had sufficient matter or evidence to impeach
the Earl of high-treason. Nevertheless, the House re∣solved
to impeach him, without a division. When he
appeared in the House of Lords next day, he found him∣self
avoided by his brother peers, as infectious; and retired
<PB N="289" REF="295"/>
with signs of confusion. Prior and Harley having been
examined by such of the committee as were justices of the
peace for Middlesex, Mr. Walpole informed the House
that matters of such importance appeared in Prior's exami∣nation,
that he was directed to move them for that mem∣ber's
being closely confined. Prior was accordingly im∣prisoned,
and cut off from all communication. On the
twenty-first day of June, Mr. Secretary Stanhope im∣peached
James, Duke of Ormond, of high-treason, and
other high crimes and misdemeanours. Mr. Archibald
Hutchinson, one of the commissioners of trade, spoke in
favour of the Duke. He expatiated on his noble birth
and qualifications: he enumerated the great services per∣formed
to the crown and nation by his grace and his an∣cestors:
he observed, that in the whole course of his late
conduct, he had only obeyed the Queen's commands; and
he affirmed that all the allegations against him could not,
in the rigour of the law, be construed into high-treason.
Mr. Hutchinson was seconded by General Lumley, who
urged that the Duke of Ormond had on all occasions
given signal proofs of his affection for his country, as
well as of personal courage; and that he had generously
expended the best part of his estate, by living abroad in a
most noble and splendid manner, for the honour of his
sovereign. Sir Joseph Jekyll said, if there was room for
mercy, he hoped it would be shown to that noble, ge∣nerous,
and courageous peer, who had in a course of
many years exerted those great accomplishments for the
good and honour of his country: that, as the statute of
Edward III. on which the charge of high-treason against
him was to be grounded, had been mitigated by subsequent
acts, the House ought not, in his opinion, to take ad∣vantage
of that act against the Duke, but only impeach
him of high crimes and misdemeanours. General Ross,
Sir William Wyndham, and the speakers of that party,
did not abandon the Duke in this emergency: but all their
arguments and eloquence were lost upon the other faction,
by which they were greatly outnumbered. The question
<PB N="290" REF="296"/>
being put, was carried for the impeachment of the Duke
of Ormond, who perceiving every thing conducted by a
furious spirit of revenge, and that he could not expect the
benefit of an impartial trial, consulted his own safety, by
withdrawing himself from the kingdom. On the twenty-second
day of June, the Earl of Strafford was likewise
impeached by Mr. Aislaby, for having advised the fatal
suspension of arms, and the seising of Ghent and Bruges;
as well as for having treated the most serene house of
Hanover with insolence and contempt. He was also de∣fended
by his friends, but overpowered by his enemies.</P>
<P>§ XVII. When the articles against the Earl of Oxford
were read in the House, a warm debate arose upon the
eleventh, by which he was charged with having advised
the French King in what manner Tournay might be
gained from the States-General. The question being put,
Whether this article amounted to high-treason? Sir
Robert Raymond, formerly sollicitor-general, maintained
the negative, and was supported not only by Sir William
Wyndham, and the Tories, but also by Sir Joseph Jekyll.
This honest patriot said it was ever his principle to do
justice to every body, from the highest to the lowest; and
that it was the duty of an honest man never to act by a
spirit of party: that he hoped he might pretend to have
some knowledge of the laws of the kingdom; and would
not scruple to declare, that, in his judgement, the charge
in question did not amount to high treason. Mr. Wal∣pole
answered with great warmth, that there were several
persons both in and out of the committee, who did not
in the least yield to that member in point of honesty, and
who were superior to him in the knowledge of the laws,
yet were satisfied that the charge specified in the eleventh
article amounted to high-treason. This point being de∣cided
against the Earl, and the other articles approved by the
House, Lord Coningsby, attended by the Whig member<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
impeached the Earl of Oxford at the bar of the House of
Lords, demanding, at the same time, that he might be
sequestered from parliament, and committed to safe custod<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.
<PB N="291" REF="297"/>
A motion was made, that the consideration of the articles
might be adjourned. After a short debate the articles
were read: then the Tory lords moved that the judges
might be consulted. The motion being rejected, another
was made, that the Earl should be committed to safe
custody: this occasioned another debate, in which he him∣self
spoke to the following purpose: That the whole
charge might be reduced to the negociations and conclu∣sion
of the peace: that the nation wanted a peace, he said,
nobody would deny: that the conditions of this peace
were as good as could be expected, considering the back∣wardness
and reluctancy which some of the allies showed
to come into the Queen's measures: that the peace was
approved by two successive parliaments: that he had no
share in the affair at Tournay, which was wholly trans∣acted
by that unfortunate nobleman who had thought fit
to step aside: that, for his own part, he always acted by
the immediate directions and commands of the late Queen,
without offending against any known law; and, being
justified by his own conscience, was unconcerned for the
life of an insignificant old man: that, if ministers of state,
acting by the immediate commands of their sovereign, are
afterwards to be made accountable for their proceedings,
it might one day or other be the case with all the mem∣bers
of that august assembly: that he did not doubt their
lordships, out of regard to themselves, would give him an
equitable hearing: and that in the prosecution of the en∣quiry
it would appear he had merited not only the in∣dulgence,
but even the favour of this government. “My
lords (said he) I am now to take my leave of your lord∣ships,
and of this honourable House, perhaps for ever.
I shall lay down my life with pleasure in a cause fa∣voured
by my late dear royal mistress. When I con∣sider
that I am to be judged by the justice, honour, and
virtue of my peers, I shall acquiesce, and retire with
great content; and, my lords, God's will be done.”
The Duke of Shrewsbury having acquainted the House
that the Earl was very much indisposed with the gravel,
<PB N="292" REF="298"/>
he was suffered to remain at his own house, in custody
of the black-rod: in his way thither he was attended by
a great multitude of people, crying, “High-church,
Ormond, and Oxford, for ever!” Next day he was
brought to the bar; where he received a copy of the ar∣ticles,
and was allowed a month to prepare his answer.
Though Dr. Mead declared that if the Earl should be
sent to the Tower his life would be in danger, it was car∣ried,
on a division, that he should be conveyed thither on
the sixteenth day of July. During the debate, the Earl
of Anglesey observed that these impeachments were dis∣agreeable
to the nation; and that it was to be feared such
violent measures would make the sceptre shake in the
King's hands. This expression kindled the whole House
into a flame. Some members cried, “To the Tower!”
some, “To order!” The Earl of Sunderland declared,
that if these words had been spoken in another place, he
would have called the person that spoke them to an ac∣count:
in the mean time, he moved that the noble lord
should explain himself. Anglesey, dreading the resent∣ment
of the House, was glad to make an apology; which
was accepted. The Earl of Oxford was attended to the
Tower by a prodigious concourse of people, who did not
scruple to exclaim against his persecutors. Tumults were
raised in Staffordshire, and other parts of the kingdom,
against the Whig party, which had depressed the friends
of the church, and embroiled the nation. The House of
Commons presented an address to the King, desiring that
the laws might be vigorously executed against the rioters.
They prepared the proclamation-act, decreeing that if any
persons, to the number of twelve, unlawfully assembled,
should continue together one hour after having been re∣quired
to disperse by a justice of peace or other officer,
and heard the proclamation against riots read in publick,
they should be deemed guilty of felony without benefit of
clergy.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. When the King went to the House of Peers,
on the twentieth day of July, to give the royal assent to
<PB N="293" REF="299"/>
this, and some other bills, he told both Houses, that a
rebellion was actually begun at home; and that the nation
was threatened with an invasion from abroad. He, there∣fore,
expected that the Commons would not leave the
kingdom in a defenceless condition, but enable him to
take such measures as should be necessary for the publick
safety. Addresses in the usual style were immediately pre∣sented
by the parliament, the convocation, the common-council
and lieutenancy of London, and the two univer∣sities:
but that of Oxford was received in the most con∣temptuous
manner; and the deputies were charged with
disloyalty, on account of a fray which had happened be∣tween
some recruiting officers and the scholars of the uni∣versity.
The addresses from the kirk of Scotland, and the
dissenting ministers of London and Westminster, met with
a much more gracious reception. The parliament forth∣with
passed a bill, empowering the King to secure sus∣pected
persons, and to suspend the Habeas-corpus act in
that time of danger. A clause was added to a money-bill,
offering the reward of one hundred thousand pounds to
such as should seise the Pretender, dead or alive. Sir
George Byng was sent to take the command of the fleet:
General Erle repaired to his government of Portsmouth:
the guards were encamped in Hyde-Park: Lord Irwin
was appointed governor of Hull, in the room of Brigadier
Sutton, who, together with Lord Windsor, the Generals
Ross, Webb, and Stuart, were dismissed from the service.
Orders were given for raising thirteen regiments of dra∣goons,
and eight of infantry; and the trained-bands were
kept in readiness to suppress tumults. In the midst of
these transactions the Commons added six articles to those
exhibited against the Earl of Oxford. Lord Bolingbroke
was impeached at the bar of the House of Lords by Mr.
Walpole. Bills being brought in to summon him and the
Duke of Ormond to surrender themselves by the tenth of
September, or, in default thereof, to attaint them of high-treason,
they passed both Houses, and received the royal
assent. On the last day of August, the Commons agreed
<PB N="294" REF="300"/>
to the articles against the Earl of Strafford, which being
presented to the House of Lords, the Earl made a speech
in his own vindication. He complained that his papers
had been seised in an unprecedented manner. He said, if
he had in his letters or discourse dropped any unguarded
expressions against some foreign ministers, while he had
the honour to represent the crown of Great-Britain, he
hoped they would not be accounted criminal by a British
House of Peers: the desired he might be allowed a com∣petent
time to answer the articles brought against him,
and have duplicates of all the papers which had either
been laid before the committee of secresy, or remained in
the hands of government, to be used occasionally in his
justification. This request was vehemently opposed by
the leaders of the other party, until the Earl of Ilay re∣presented
that, in all civilised nations, all courts of ju∣dicature,
except the Inquisition, allowed the persons ar∣raigned
all that was necessary for their justification; and
that the House of Peers of Great-Britain ought not, in
this case, to do any thing contrary to that honour and
equity for which they were so justly renowned throughout
all Europe. This observation made an impression on the
House, which resolved that the Earl should be indulged
with copies of such papers as he might have occasion to use
in his defence.</P>
<P>§ XIX. On the third day of September, Oxford's an∣swer
was delivered to the House of Lords, who transmitted
it to the Commons. Mr. Walpole, having heard it read,
said it contained little more than a repetition of what had
been suggested in some pamphlets and papers which had
been published in vindication of the late ministry: that it
was a false and malicious libel, laying upon his royal
mistress the blame of all the pernicious measures he had
led her into, against her own honour, and the good of his
country: that it was likewise a libel on the proceedings
of the Commons, since he endeavoured to clear those per∣sons
who had already confessed their guilt by slight. After
some debate, the House resolved, That the answer of
<PB N="295" REF="301"/>
Robert Earl of Oxford should be referred to the committee
appointed to draw up articles of impeachment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. 1715.</NOTE> and prepare
evidence against the impeached Lords; and that the com∣mittee
should prepare a replication to the answer. This
was accordingly prepared, and sent up to the Lords. Then
the committee reported, That Mr. Prior had grossly preva∣ricated
on his examination, and behaved with great con∣tempt
of their authority. The Duke of Ormond and Lord
Viscount Bolingbroke having omitted to surrender them∣selves
within the time limited, the House of Lords ordered
the Earl-Marshal to raze out of the list of peers their names
and armorial bearings. Inventories were taken of their per∣sonal
estates; and the Duke's atchievement, as knight of
the garter, was taken down from St. George's chapel at
Windsor. A man of candour cannot, without an emotion
of grief and indignation, reflect upon the ruin of the noble
family of Ormond, in the person of a brave, generous, and
humane nobleman, to whom no crime was imputed, but
that of having obeyed the command of his sovereign. About
this period, the royal assent was given to an act for encou∣raging
loyalty in Scotland. By this law the tenant who
continued peaceable while his lord took arms in favour of
the Pretender was invested with the property of the lands
he rented: on the other hand, it was decreed that the lands
possessed by any person guilty of high-treason should revert
to the superior of whom they were held, and be consoli∣dated
with the superiority; and that all entails and settle∣ments
of estates, since the first day of August, in favour of
children, with a fraudulent intent to avoid the punishment
of the law due to the offence of high-treason, should be null
and void. It likewise contained a clause for summoning sus∣pected
persons to find bail for their good behaviour, on pain
of being denounced rebels. By virtue of this clause all the
heads of the Jacobite clans, and other suspected persons,
were summoned to Edinburgh; and those who did not
appear were declared rebels.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="302"/>
§ XX. By this time the rebellion was actually begun
in Scotland.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1715.</NOTE> The dissentions occasioned in that country
by the Union had never been wholly appeased. Even
since the Queen's death, addresses were prepared in dif∣ferent
parts of Scotland against the Union, which was
deemed a national grievance: and the Jacobites did not
fail to encourage this aversion. Though their hopes of
dissolving that treaty were baffled by the industry and
other arts of the Revolutioners, who secured a majority
of Whigs in parliament, they did not lay aside their de∣sign
of attempting something of consequence in favour of
the Pretender; but maintained a correspondence with the
malcontents of England, a great number of whom were
driven by apprehension, hard usage, and resentment into
a system of politicks which otherwise they would not have
espoused. The Tories finding themselves totally excluded
from any share in the government and legislature, and ex∣posed
to the insolence and fury of a saction which they
despised, began to wish in earnest for a revolution. Some
of them held private consultations, and communicated
with the Jacobites, who conveyed their sentiments to the
Chevalier de St. George, with such exaggerations as were
dictated by their own eagerness and extravagance. They
assured the Pretender that the nation was wholly disassected
to the new government; and, indeed, the clamours, tu∣mults,
and conversation of the people in general coun∣tenanced
this assertion. They promised to take arms without
further delay in his favour; and engaged that the Tories
should join them at his first landing in Great-Britain.
They, therefore, besought him to come over with all
possible expedition, declaring that his appearance would
produce an immediate revolution. The Chevalier re∣solved
to take the advantage of this favourable disposition.
He had recourse to the French King, who had always
been the refuge of his family. Louis favoured him in
secret; and, notwithstanding his late engagements with
England, cherished the ambition of raising him to the
throne of Great-Britain. He supplied him privately with
<PB N="297" REF="303"/>
sums of money, to prepare a small armament in the port of
Havre, which was equipped in the name of Depine d'Ani∣caut;
and, without all doubt, his design was to assist him
more effectually, in proportion as the English should mani∣fest
their attachment to the house of Stuart. The Duke
of Ormond and Lord Bolingbroke, who had retired to
France, finding themselves condemned unheard, and at∣tainted,
engaged in the service of the Chevalier, and corres∣ponded
with the Tories of England.</P>
<P>§ XXI. All these intrigues and machinations were dis∣covered
and communicated to the court of London by the
Earl of Stair, who then resided as English ambassador at
Paris. He was a nobleman of unquestioned honour and in∣tegrity,
generous, humane, discerning, and resolute. He
had signalized himself by his valour, intrepidity, and other
military talents, during the war in the Netherlands; and he
now acted in another sphere with uncommon vigour, vigi∣lance,
and address. He detected the Chevalier's scheme
while it was yet in embryo, and gave such early notice
of it as enabled the King of Great-Britain to take effectual
measures for defeating the design. All the Pretender's in∣terest
in France expired with Louis XIV. that ostentatious
tyrant, who had for above half a century sacrificed the re∣pose
of Christendom to his insatiate vanity and ambition.
At his death, which happened on the first day of Septem∣ber,
the regency of the kingdom devolved to the Duke
of Orleans, who adopted a new system of politicks, and
had already entered into engagements with the King of
Great-Britain. Instead of assisting the Pretender, he
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mused his agents with mysterious and equivocal expressi∣ons,
calculated to frustrate the design of the expedition.
Nevertheless, the more violent part of the Jacobites in
Great-Britain believed he was at bottom a friend to their
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ause and depended upon him for succour. They even
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>torted from him a sum of money by dint of importunities,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d some arms: but the vessel was shipwrecked, and the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgo lost upon the coast of Scotland.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="304"/>
§ XXII. The partisans of the Pretender had proceeded
too far to retreat with safety; and, therefore, resolved to
try their fortune in the field. The Earl of Mar repaired
to the Highlands, where he held consultations with the
Marquisses of Huntley and Tullibardine, the Earls Ma∣rischal
and Southesk, the Generals Hamilton and Cor∣don,
with the chiefs of the Jacobite clans. Then he
assembled three hundred of his own vassals; proclaimed
the Pretender at Castletown, and set up his standard at
Brae-Mar, on the sixth day of September. By this time
the Earls of Home, Wigtoun, and Kinnoul, Lord Desk∣ford,
and Lockhart of Carnwath, with other persons sus∣pected
of disaffection to the present government, were
committed prisoners to the castle of Edinburgh; and Ma∣jor-General
Whetham marched with the regular troops
which were in that kingdom to secure the bridge at Stir∣ling.
Before these precautions were taken, two vessels
had arrived at Arbroath from Havre, with arms, ammu∣nition,
and a great number of officers, who assured the
Earl of Mar, that the Pretender would soon be with them
in person. The death of Louis XIV. struck a general
damp upon their spirits; but they laid their account with
being joined by a powerful body in England. The Earl
of Mar, by letters and messages, pressed the Chevalier to
come over without further delay. He, in the mean time,
assumed the title of lieutenant-general of the Pretender's
forces, and published a declaration, exhorting the people
to take arms for their lawful sovereign. This was fol∣lowed
by a shrewd manifesto, explaining the national
grievances, and assuring the people of redress. Some of
his partisans attempted to surprise the castle of Edinburgh;
but were prevented by the vigilance and activity of Colonel
Stuart, lieutenant-governor of that fortress. The Duke
of Argyle set out for Scotland as commander in chief of
the forces in North-Britain: the Earl of Sutherland set
fail in the Queenborough ship of war for the North, where
he proposed to raise his vassals for the service of govern∣ment▪
and many other Scottish peers returned to their
<PB N="299" REF="305"/>
own country, in order to signalize their loyalty to King
George.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. In England the practices of the Jacobites did
not escape the notice of the ministry. Lieutenant-Colonel
Paul was imprisoned in the Gate-house, for inlisting men
in the service of the Pretender. The titular Duke of Powis
was committed to the Tower: Lords Landsdown and Du∣plin
were taken into custody; and a warrant was issued for
apprehending the Earl of Jersey. The King desired the
consent of the Lower House to seise and detain Sir Wil∣liam
Wyndham, Sir John Packington, Mr. Edward Har∣vey,
of Combe, Mr. Thomas Forster, Mr. John Anstis,
and Mr. Corbet Kynaston, who were members of the
House, and suspected of favouring the invasion. The
Commons unanimously agreed to the proposal, and pre∣sented
an address, signifying their approbation. Harvey
and Anstis were immediately secured. Forster, with the
assistance of some popish lords, assembled a body of men
in Northumberland: Sir John Packington being examined
before the council, was dismissed for want of evidence:
Mr. Kynaston absconded: Sir William Wyndham was
seised at his own house in Somersetshire, by Colonel Huske
and a messenger, who secured his papers: he found means,
however, to escape from them; but afterward surrendered
himself, and, having been examined at the council-board,
was committed to the Tower. His father-in-law, the Duke
of Somerset, offered to become bound for his appearance;
and being rejected as bail, expressed his resentment so
warmly, that the King thought proper to remove him from
the office of master of the horse. On the twenty-first day of
September, the King went to the House of Lords, and passed
the bills that were ready for the royal assent. Then the Chan∣cellor
read his Majesty's speech, expressing his acknowledge∣ment
and satisfaction in consequence of the uncommon
marks of their affection he had received; and the parlia∣ment
adjourned to the sixth day of October.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="306"/>
§ XXIV. The friends of the house of Stuart were vey numerous
in the western counties, and began to make
preparations for an insurrection. They had concealed
some arms and artillery at Bath, and formed a design to
surprise Bristol; but they were betrayed and discovered by
the emissaries of the government; which baffled all their
schemes, and apprehended every person of consequence
suspected of attachment to that cause. The university of
Oxford felt the rod of power on this occasion. Major-General
Pepper, with a strong detachment of dragoons,
took possession of the city at day break, declaring he would
use military execution on all students who should presume
to appear without the limits of their respective colleges.
He seised ten or eleven persons, among whom was one
Lloyd, a coffeeman; and made prize of some horses and
furniture belonging to Colonel Owen, and other gentle∣men.
With this booty he retreated to Abingdon; and
Handasyde's regiment of foot was afterwards quartered
in Oxford, to overawe the university. The ministry
found it more difficult to suppress the insurgents in the
northern counties. In the month of October the Earl of
Derwentwater and Mr. Forster took the field with a body
of horse, and being joined by some gentlemen from the
borders of Scotland, proclaimed the Pretender in Wark∣worth,
Morpeth, and Alnwick. Their first design was
to seise the town of Newcastle, in which they had many
friends: but they found the gates shut upon them, and
retired to Hexham; while General Carpenter having
assembled a body of dragoons, resolved to march from
Newcastle, and attack them before they should be re-en∣forced.
The rebels retiring northward to Wooler, were
joined by two hundred Scottish horse under the Lord Vis∣count
Kenmuir, and the Earls of Carnwath and Win∣toun,
who had set up the Pretender's standard at Mossat,
and proclaimed him in different parts of Scotland. The
rebels thus re-enforced advanced to Kelso, having received
advice that they would be joined by Mackintosh, who had
corssed the Forth with a body of Highlanders.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="307"/>
§ XXV. By this time the Earl of Mar was at the head
of ten thousand men well armed. He had secured the pass
of the Tay at Perth, where his head-quarters were esta∣blished,
and made himself master of the whole fruitful pro∣vince
of Fife, and all the sea-coast on that side of the frith
of Edinburgh. He selected two thousand five hundred
men, commanded by Brigadier Mackintosh, to make a
descent upon the Lothian side, and join the Jacobites in
that county, or such as should take arms on the borders
of England. Boats were assembled for this purpose; and,
notwithstanding all the precautions that could be taken
by the King's ships in the frith, to prevent the design,
above fifteen hundred chosen men made good their passage
in the night, and landed on the coast of Lothian, having
crossed an arm of the sea about sixteen miles broad, in open
boats that passed through the midst of the King's cruisers.
Nothing could be better concerted, or executed with more
conduct and courage, than was this hazardous enterprise.
They amused the King's ships with marches and counter∣marches
along the coast, in such a manner that they
could not possibly know where they intended to embark.
The Earl of Mar, in the mean time, marched from Perth to
Dumblaine, as if he had intended to cross the Forth at
Stirling-bridge: but his real design was to divert the Duke
of Argyle from attacking his detachment which had land∣ed
in Lothian. So far the scheme succeeded. The Duke,
who had assembled some troops in Lothian, returned to
Stirling with the utmost expedition, after having secured
Edinburgh, and obliged Mackintosh to abandon his design
on that city. This partisan had actually taken possession
of Leith, from whence he retired to Seaton-house, near
Preston-Pans, which he fortified in such a manner that he
could not be forced without artillery. Here he remained
until he received an order across the Frith from the Earl
of Mar, to join Lord Kenmuir and the English at Kelso,
for which place he immediately began his march, and
reached it on the twenty-second day of October, though a
good number of his men had deserted on the route.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="308"/>
§ XXVI. The Lord Kenmuir, with the Earls of Win∣toun,
Nithsdale, and Carnwath; the Earl of Derwent∣water
and Mr. Forster, with the English insurgents,
arriving at the same time, a council of war was immediate∣ly
called. Wintoun proposed that they should march im∣mediately
into the western parts of Scotland, and join
General Gordon, who commanded a strong body of
Highlanders in Argyleshire. The English insisted upon
crossing the Tweed, and attacking General Carpenter,
whose troops did not exceed nine hundred dragoons.
Neither scheme was executed. They took the route to
Jedburgh, where they resolved to leave Carpenter on one
side, and penetrate into England by the western border.
The Highlanders declared they would not quit their own
country; but were ready to execute the scheme proposed
by the Earl of Wintoun. Means, however, were found to
prevail upon one half of them to advance, while the rest
returned to the Highlands. At Brampton, Forster opened
his commission of general, which had been sent to him from
the Earl of Mar, and proclaimed the Pretender. They
continued their march to Penrith, where the sheriff, assisted
by the Lord Lonsdale and the Bishop of Carlisle, had
assembled the whole posse-comitatus of Cumberland,
amounting to twelve thousand men, who dispersed with the
utmost precipitation at the approach of the rebels. From
Penrith, Forster proceeded by the way of Kendal and
Lancaster to Preston, from whence Stanhope's regiment
of dragoons, and another of militia, immediately retired;
so that he took possession of the place without resistance.
General Willis marched against the enemy with six regi∣ments
of horse and dragoons, and one battalion of foot com∣manded
by Colonel Preston. They had advanced to the
bridge of Ribble before Forster received intelligence of
their approach. He forthwith began to raise barricadoes,
and put the place in a posture of defence. On the twelfth day
of November, the town was briskly attacked in two differ∣ent
places; but the King's troops met with a very warm
reception, and were repulsed with considerable loss. Next
<PB N="303" REF="309"/>
day General Carpenter arrived with a re-enforcement of
three regiments of dragoons; and the rebels were invested
on all sides. The Highlanders declared they would make
a sally sword in hand, and either cut their way through
the King's troops, or perish in the attempt; but they were
over-ruled. Forster sent Colonel Oxburgh with a trum∣pet,
to General Willis, to propose a capitulation. He
was given to understand, that the General would not treat
with rebels; but in case of their surrendering at discretion
he would prevent his soldiers from putting them to the
sword, until he should receive further orders. He granted
them time to consider till next morning, upon their deliver∣ing
the Earl of Derwentwater and Mackintosh as hos∣tages.
When Forster submitted, this Highlander declared
he could not promise that the Scots would surrender in that
manner. The general desired him to return to his people,
and he would forthwith attack the town, in which case every
man of them should be cut in pieces. The Scottish noble∣men
did not choose to run that risque; and persuaded the
Highlanders to accept the terms that were offered. They
accordingly laid down their arms, and were put under a
strong guard. All the noblemen and leaders were secured.
Major Nairn, Captain Lockhart, Captain Shaftoe, and
Ensign Erskine, were tried by a court-martial as deserters,
and executed. Lord Charles Murray, son of the Duke
of Athol, was likewise condemned for the same crime,
but reprieved. The common men were imprisoned at
Chester and Liverpool; the noblemen and considerable
officers were sent to London, conveyed through the streets
pinioned like malefactors, and committed to the Tower and
to Newgate.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. The day on which the rebels surrendered at
Preston was remarkable for the battle of Dumblaine,
fought between the Duke of Argyle and the Earl of Man,
who commanded the Pretender's forces. This nobleman
had retreated to his camp at Perth, when he understood
the Duke was returned from Lothian to Stirling. But
being now joined by the northern clans under the Earl of
<PB N="304" REF="310"/>
Seaforth, and those of the west commanded by General
Gordon, who had signalized himself in the service of the
Czar of Muscovy, he resolved to pass the Forth, in order
to join his southern friends, that they might march to∣gether
into England. With this view he advanced to
Auchterarder, where he reviewed his army, and rested on
the eleventh day of November. The Duke of Argyle, ap∣prised
of his intention, and being joined by some regiments
of dragoons from Ireland, determined to give him battle in
the neighbourhood of Dumblaine. On the twelfth day of
the month, Argyle passed the Forth at Stirling, and en∣camped
with his left at the village of Dumblaine, and his
right towards Sheriff-moor. The Earl of Mar advanced
within two miles of his camp, and remained till day-break in
order of battle; his army consisting of nine thousand effect∣ive
men, cavalry as well as infantry. In the morning, the
Duke, understanding they were in motion, drew up his
forces, which did not exceed three thousand five hundred
men, on the heights to the north-east of Dumblaine; but he
was outflanked both on the right and left. The clans that
formed part of the centre and right wing of the enemy,
with Glengary and Clanronald at their head, charged the
left of the King's army sword in hand, with such impetuo∣sity,
that in seven minutes both horse and foot were totally
routed with great slaughter; and General Whetham, who
commanded them, fled at full gallop to Stirling, where
he declared that the royal army was totally defeated. In
the mean time, the Duke of Argyle, who commanded
in person on the right, attacked the left of the enemy, at
the head of Stair's and Evans's dragoons, and drove them
two miles before him, as far as the water of Allan: yet
in that space they wheeled about, and attempted to rally ten
times; so that he was obliged to press them hard, that
they might not recover from their confusion. Brigadier
Wightman followed, in order to sustain him with three
battalions of infantry; while the victorious right wing of
the rebels having pursued Whetham a considerable way,
returned to the field, and formed in the rear of Wight∣man,
<PB N="305" REF="311"/>
to the amount of five thousand men. The Duke of
Argyle, returning from the pursuit, joined Wightman,
who had faced about, and taken possession of some en∣closures
and mud-walls, in expectation of being attacked.
In this posture both armies fronted each other till the
evening, when the Duke drew off towards Dumblaine, and
the rebels retired to Ardoch, without mutual molestation.
Next day, the Duke marching back to the field of battle,
carried off the wounded, with four pieces of cannon left by
the enemy, and retreated to Stirling. Few prisoners were
taken on either side: the number of the slain might be
about five hundred of each army; and both generals
claimed the victory. This battle was not so fatal to the
Highlanders as the loss of Inverness, from which Sir John
Mackenzie was driven by Simon Frazer Lord Lovat, who,
contrary to the principles he had hitherto professed, secured
this important post for the government; by which means
a free communication was opened with the north of Scot∣land,
where the Earl of Sutherland had raised a consider∣able
body of vassals. The Marquis of Huntley and the
Earl of Seaforth were obliged to quit the rebel army, in
order to defend their own territories; and in a little time
submitted to King George: a good number of the Frazers
declared with their chiefs against the Pretender: the Mar∣quis
of Tullibardine withdrew from the army, to cover his
own country; and the clans, seeing no likelihood of another
action, began to disperse, according to custom.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. The government was now in a condition to
send strong re-enforcements to Scotland. Six thousand
men that were claimed of the States-General, by virtue of
the treaty, landed in England, and began their march for
Edinburgh: General Cadogan set out for the same place,
together with Brigadier Petit, and six other engineers; and
a train of artillery was shipped at the Tower for that coun∣try,
the Duke of Argyle resolving to drive the Earl of
Mar out of Perth, to which town he had retired with the
remains of his forces. The Pretender having been amused
with the hope of seeing the whole kingdom of England
<PB N="306" REF="312"/>
rise up as one man in his behalf; and the Duke of Or∣mond
having made a fruitless voyage to the western coast,
to try the disposition of the people, he was now convinced
of the vanity of his expectation in that quarter; and, as
he knew not what other course to take, he resolved to
hazard his person among his friends in Scotland, at a
time when his affairs in that kingdom were absolutely
desperate. From Bretagne he posted through part of
France, in disguise, and embarking in a small vessel at
Dunkirk, hired for that purpose, arrived on the twenty-second
day of December at Peterhead, with six gentlemen
in his retinue, one of whom was the Marquis of Tin∣mouth,
son to the Duke of Berwick. He passed through
Aberdeen incognito, to Fetterosse, where he was met by
the Earls of Mar and Marischal, and about thirty noble∣men
and gentlemen of the first quality. Here he was
solemnly proclaimed: his declaration, dated at Commercy,
was printed and circulated through all the parts in that
neighbourhood; and he received addresses from the epis∣copal
clergy, and the laity of that communion in the dio∣cese
of Aberdeen. On the fifth day of January, he made
his publick entry into Dundee; and on the seventh arrived
at Scone, where he seemed determined to stay until the
ceremony of his coronation should be performed. From
thence he made an excursion to Perth, where he reviewed
his forces. Then he formed a regular council; and pub∣lished
six proclamations; one for a general thanksgiving,
on account of his safe arrival; another enjoining the mini∣sters
to pray for him in churches; a third establishing the
currency of foreign coins; a fourth summoning the meet∣ing
of the convention of estates; a fifth ordering all sensi∣ble
men to repair to his standard; and a sixth, fixing the
twenty-third day of January for his coronation. He made
a pathetick speech in a grand council, at which all the
chiefs of his party assisted. They determined, however,
to abandon the enterprise, as the King's army was re-en∣forced
by the Dutch auxiliaries, and they themselves were
not only reduced to a small number, but likewise destitute
<PB N="307" REF="313"/>
of money, arms, ammunition, forage, and provision; for
the Duke of Argyle had taken possession of Burnet-island,
and transported a detachment to Fife, so as to cut off Mar's
communication with that fertile country.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. Notwithstanding the severity of the weather,
and a prodigious fall of snow, which rendered the roads
almost impassable, the Duke, on the twenty-ninth of
January, began his march to Dumblaine, and next day
reached Tullibardine, where he received intelligence that
the Pretender and his forces had, on the preceding day
retired towards Dundee. He forthwith took possession of
Perth; and then began his march to Aberbrothick, in
pursuit of the enemy. The Chevalier de St. George,
being thus hotly pursued, was prevailed upon to embark
on board a small French ship that lay in the harbour of
Montrose. He was accompanied by the Earls of Mar
and Melfort, the Lord Drummond, Lieutenant-General
Bulkley, and other persons of distinction, to the number
of seventeen. In order to avoid the English cruisers, they
stretched over to Norway, and coasting along the German
and Dutch shores, arrived in five days at Graveline. Ge∣neral
Gordon, whom the Pretender had left commander
in chief of the forces, assisted by the Earl Marischal, pro∣ceeded
with them to Aberdeen, where he secured three
vessels to sail northward, and take on board the persons
who intended to make their escape to the continent. Then
they continued their march through Strathspey and Strath∣down,
to the hills of Badenoch, where the common
people were quietly dismissed. This retreat was made
with such expedition, that the Duke of Argyle, with all
his activity, could never overtake their rear-guard, which
consisted of a thousand horse, commanded by the Earl Ma∣rischal.
Such was the issue of a rebellion that proved
fatal to many noble families: a rebellion which, in all
probability, would never have happened, had not the vio∣lent
measures of a Whig ministry kindled such a flame of
discontent in the nation, as encouraged the partisans of the
Pretender to hazard a revolt.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="314"/>
§ XXX. The parliament of Ireland, which met at Dub∣lin
on the twelfth day of November, seemed even more
zealous, if possible, than that of England, for the present
administration. They passed bills for recognising the
King's title; for the security of his person and govern∣ment;
for setting a price on the Pretender's head; and for
attainting the Duke of Ormond. They granted the sup∣plies
without opposition. All those who had addressed the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate Queen in favour of Sir Constantine Phipps, then lord
chancellor of Ireland, were now brought upon their
knees, and censured as guilty of a breach of privilege.
They desired the lords-justices would issue a proclamation
against the popish inhabitants of Limerick and Galway,
who, presuming upon the capitulation signed by King
William, claimed an exemption from the penalties im∣posed
upon other papists. They engaged in an association
against the Pretender, and all his abettors. They voted the
Earl of Anglesey an enemy to the King and kingdom, be∣cause
he advised the Queen to break the army, and pro∣rogue
the late parliament; and they addressed the King
to remove him from his council and service. The lords-justices
granted orders for apprehending the Earls of An∣trim
and Westmeath, the Lords Natterville, Cahir, and Dil∣lon,
as persons suspected of disaffection to the government.
Then they adjourned the two Houses.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. The King, in his speech to the English par∣liament,
which met on the ninth of January, told them
he had reason to believe the Pretender was landed in Scot∣land:
he congratulated them on the success of his arms in
suppressing the rebellion: on the conclusion of the barrier
treaty between the Emperor and the States-General, under
his guarantee; on a convention with Spain that would
deliver the trade of England to that kingdom from the
new impositions and hardships to which it was subjected
in consequence of the late treaties. He likewise gave them
to understand, that a treaty for renewing all former alli∣ances
between the crown of Great-Britain and the States-General
was almost concluded; and he assured the Com∣mons
<PB N="309" REF="315"/>
he would freely give up all the estates that should
become forfeited to the crown by this rebellion, to be ap∣plied
towards defraying the extraordinary expense in∣curred
on this occasion. The Commons, in their address
of thanks, declared that they would prosecute, in the most
vigorous and impartial manner, the authors of those de∣structive
councils which had drawn down such miseries
upon the nation. Their resolutions were speedy, and
exactly conformable to this declaration. They expelled
Mr. Forster from the House. They forthwith impeached
the Earls of Derwentwater, Nithsdale, Carnwath, and
Wintoun; Lords Widdrington, Kenmuir, and Nairn.
These noblemen being brought to the bar of the House of
Lords, heard the articles of impeachment read on the
tenth day of January, and were ordered to put in their
answers on the sixteenth. The impeachments being
lodged, the Lower House ordered a bill to be brought in
for continuing the suspension of the Habeas Corpus act:
then they prepared another to attaint the Marquis of Tul∣libardine,
the Earls of Mar and Linlithgow, and Lord
John Drummond. On the twenty-first day of January,
the King gave the royal assent to the bill for continuing
the suspension of the Habeas Corpus act. He told the
parliament that the Pretender was actually in Scotland,
heading the rebellion, and assuming the style and title of
king of these realms: he demanded of the Commons
such supply as might discourage any foreign power from
assisting the rebels. On Thursday the nineteenth day of
January, all the impeached lords pleaded guilty to the
articles exhibited against them, except the Earl of Win∣toun,
who petitioned for a longer time, on various pre∣tences.
The rest received sentence of death on the ninth
day of February, in the court erected in Westminster-Hall,
where the Lord-Chancellor Cowper presided as lord
high-steward on that occasion. The Countess of Niths∣dale
and Lady Nairn threw themselves at the King's
feet, as he passed through the appartments of the palace,
and implored his mercy in behalf of their husbands, but
<PB N="310" REF="316"/>
their tears and entreaties produced no effect. The council
resolved that the sentence should be executed, and orders
were given for that purpose to the Lieutenant of the
Tower, and the Sheriffs of London and Middlesex.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. The Countess of Derwentwater, with her
sister, accompanied by the Duchesses of Cleveland and
Bolton, and several other ladies of the first distinction,
was introduced by the Dukes of Richmond and St. Al∣ban's
into the King's bed-chamber, where she invoked
his Majesty's clemency for her unfortunate consort. She
afterwards repaired to the lobby of the House of Peers.
attended by the ladies of the other condemned lords, and
above twenty others of the same quality, and begged the
intercession of the House: but no regard was paid to their
petition. Next day, they petitioned both Houses of par∣liament.
The Commons rejected their suit. In the Up∣per
House, the Duke of Richmond delivered a petition
from the Earl of Derwentwater, to whom he was nearly
related, at the same time declaring that he himself should
oppose his sollicitation. The Earl of Derby expressed
some compassion for the numerous family of Lord Nairn.
Petitions from the rest were presented by other lords,
moved with pity and humanity. Lord Townshend and
others vehemently opposed their being read. The Earl of
Nottingham thought this indulgence might be granted:
the House assented to his opinion; and agreed to an ad∣dress,
praying his Majesty would reprieve such of the
condemned lords as should seem to deserve his mercy. To
this petition the King answered, That on this and all other
occasions he would do what he thought most consistent
with the dignity of his crown and the safety of his peo∣ple.
The Earl of Nottingham, president of the council,
his brother the Earl of Aylesbury, chancellor of the duchy
of Lancaster, his son Lord Finch, one of the lords of the
Treasury, his kinsman Lord Guernsey, master of the jewel-office,
were altogether dismissed from his Majesty's service.
Orders were dispatched for executing the Earls of Der∣wentwater
and Nithsdale, and the Viscount of Kenmuir.
<PB N="311" REF="317"/>
immediately: the others were respited to the seventh day
of March. Nithsdale made his escape in women's apparel,
furnished and conveyed to him by his own mother. On
the twenty-fourth day of February, Derwentwater and
Kenmuir were beheaded on Tower-Hill. The former was
an amiable youth, brave, open, generous, hospitable, and
humane. His fate drew tears from the spectators, and
was a great misfortune to the country in which he lived.
He gave bread to multitudes of people whom he employed
on his estate; the poor, the widow, and the orphan rejoiced
in his bounty. Kenmuir was a virtuous nobleman, calm,
sensible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals.</NOTE> resolute, and resigned. He was a devout member
of the English church;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bolingbroke Patten.</NOTE> but the other died in the faith of
Rome;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deb. in Par.</NOTE> both adhered to their political principles. On the
fifteenth day of March,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tindal.</NOTE> Wintoun was brought to trial,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State Trials.</NOTE> and
being convicted received sentence of death.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. When the King passed the land-tax bill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1716.</NOTE>
which was ushered in with a very extraordinary preamble,
he informed both Houses of the Pretender's flight from
Scotland. In the beginning of April, a commission for
trying the rebels met in the court of Common-Pleas, when
bills of high-treason were found against Mr. Forster,
Mackintosh, and twenty of their confederates. Forster
escaped from Newgate, and reached the continent in safety:
the rest pleaded Not-guilty, and were indulged with time
to prepare for their trials. The judges appointed to try
the rebels at Liverpool found a considerable number
guilty of high-treason. Two-and-twenty were executed
at Preston and Manchester: about a thousand prisoners
submitted to the King's mercy, and petitioned for trans∣portation.
Pitts, the keeper of Newgate, being suspected
of having connived at Forster's escape, was tried for his
life at the Old-Bailey, and acquitted. Notwithstanding
this prosecution, which ought to have redoubled the vigi∣lance
of the jailors, Brigadier Mackintosh, and several
other prisoners, broke from Newgate, after having mastered
the keeper and turnkey, and disarmed the sentinel. The
<PB N="312" REF="318"/>
court proceeded with the trials of those that remained;<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1716.</NOTE> and
a great number were found guilty; four or five were hang∣ed,
drawn, and quartered, at Tyburn; and among these
was one William Paul, a clergyman, who, in his last
speech, professed himself a true and sincere member of the
church of England, but not of the revolution schismatical
church, whose bishops had abandoned the King, and shame∣fully
given up their ecclesiastical rights, by submitting to
the unlawful, invalid, lay-deprivations authorised by the
Prince of Orange.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. Though the rebellion was extinguished,
the flame of national dissatisfaction still continued to rage:
the severities exercised against the rebels increased the
general discontent; for now the danger was blown over
their humane passions began to prevail. The courage
and fortitude with which the condemned persons encoun∣tered
the pains of death in its most dreadful form propos∣sessed
many spectators in favour of the cause by which
those unhappy souls were animated. In a word, per∣secution,
as usual, extended the heresy. The ministry
perceiving this universal disaffection, and dreading the
revolution of a new parliament, which might wrest the
power from their faction, and retort upon them the vio∣lence
of their own measures, formed a resolution equally
odious and effectual to establish their administration. This
was no other than a scheme to repeal the triennial act,
and by a new law to extend the term of parliaments to
seven years. On the tenth day of April, the Duke of
Devonshire represented, in the House of Lords, that trien∣nial
elections served to keep up party divisions; to raise
and foment feuds in private families; to produce ruinous
expenses, and give occasion to the cabals and intrigues of
foreign princes; that it became the wisdom of such an
august assembly to apply proper remedies to an evil that
might be attended with the most dangerous consequences,
especially in the present temper of the nation, as the spi∣rit
of rebellion still remained unconquered. He, therefore,
proposed a bill for enlarging the continuance of parlia∣ments.
<PB N="313" REF="319"/>
He was seconded by the Earls of Dorset and
Rockingham,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. I. 1716.</NOTE> the Duke of Argyle, Lord Townshend, and
the other chiefs of that party. The motion was opposed
by the Earls of Nottingham, Abingdon, and Paulet.
They observed that frequent parliaments were required
by the fundamental constitution of the kingdom, ascer∣tained
in the practice of many ages; that the members of
the Lower House were chosen by the body of the nation,
for a certain term of years, at the expiration of which
they could be no longer representatives of the people, who,
by the parliament's protracting its own authority, would
be deprived of the only remedy which they have against
those who, through ignorance or corruption, betrayed the
trust reposed in them; that the reasons in favour of such
a bill were weak and frivolous; that, with respect to foreign
alliances, no prince or state could reasonably depend upon
a people to defend their liberties and interests who should
be thought to have given up so great a part of their own;
nor would it be prudent in them to wish for a change in
that constitution under which Europe had of late been so
powerfully supported; on the contrary, they might be de∣terred
from entering into any engagements with Great-Britain,
when informed by the preamble of the bill, that
the popish faction was so dangerous as to threaten de∣struction
to the government; they would apprehend that
the administration was so weak as to want so extraordinary
a provision for its safety; that the gentlemen of Britain
were not to be trusted; and that the good affections of the
people were restrained within the limits of the House of
Commons. They affirmed that this bill, far from pre∣venting
the expense of elections, would rather increase it,
and encourage every species of corruption; for the value
of a seat would always be in proportion to the duration of
a parliament; and the purchase would rise accordingly;
that a long parliament would yield a greater temptation,
as well as a better opportunity to a vicious ministry, to
corrupt the members, than they could possibly have when
the parliaments were short and frequent; that the same
<PB N="314" REF="320"/>
reasons urged for passing the bill to continue this parliament
for seven years would be at least as strong, and, by the con∣duct
of the ministry, might be made much stronger before
the end of that term, for continuing, and even perpetuating
their legislative power, to the absolute subversion of the third
estate of the realm. These arguments served only to form
a decent debate, after which the bill for septennial parlia∣ments
passed by a great majority; though twenty peers en∣tered
a protest. It met with the same fate in the Lower
House, where many strong objections were started to no
purpose. They were represented as the effects of party
spleen; and, indeed, this was the great spring of action on
both sides. The question for the bill was carried in the
affirmative; and in a little time it received the royal sanc∣tion.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. The rebellion being utterly quelled, and
all the suspected persons of consequence detained in safe
custody, the King resolved to visit his German dominions,
where he foresaw a storm gathering from the quarter of
Sweden. Charles XII. was extremely exasperated against
the Elector of Hanover, for having entered into the con∣federacy
against him in his absence, particularly for his
having purchased the duchies of Bremen and Verden,
which constituted part of his dominions; and he breathed
nothing but revenge against the King of Great-Britain.
It was with a view to avert this danger or prepare against
it, that the King now determined upon a voyage to the
continent. But as he was restricted from leaving his
British dominions, by the act for the further limitation of
the crown, this clause was repealed in a new bill that
passed through both Houses without the least difficulty.
On the twenty-sixth day of June, the King closed the
session with a speech upon the usual topicks, in which,
however, he observed that the numerous instances of mercy
he had shown served only to encourage the faction of the
Pretender, whose partisans acted with such insolence and
folly, as if they intended to convince the world that they
were not to be reclaimed by gentle methods. He in∣timated
<PB N="315" REF="321"/>
his purpose of visiting his dominions in Germany;
and gave them to understand, that he had constituted his
beloved son, the Prince of Wales, guardian of the kingdom
in his absence. About this period, General Macartney,
who had returned to England at the accession of King
George, presented himself to trial for the murther of the
Duke of Hamilton. The deposition of Colonel Hamil∣ton
was contradicted by two park-keepers: the General
was acquuitted of the charge, restored to his rank in the
army, and gratified with the command of a regiment.
The King's brother, Prince Ernest, Bishop of Osnabruck,
was created Duke of York and Albany, and Earl of Ul∣ster.
The Duke of Argyle, and his brother the Earl of
Ilay, to whom his Majesty owed, in a great measure, his
peaceable accession to the throne, as well as the extinction
of the rebellion in Scotland, were now dismissed from all
their employments. General Carpenter succeeded the
Duke in the chief command of the forces in North-Britain,
and in the government of Port-Mahon; and the Duke of
Montrose was appointed lord-register of Scotland, in the
room of the Earl of Ilay.</P>
<P>§ XXXVI. On the seventh day of July, the King em∣barked
at Gravesend, landed on the ninth in Holland,
through which he passed incognito to Hanover, and from
thence set out for Pyrmont. His aim was to secure his
German dominions from the Swede, and Great-Britain
from the Pretender. These two princes had already be∣gun
to form a design, in conjunction, of invading his
kingdom. He knew the Duke of Orleans was resolved to
ascend the throne of France, in case the young King, who
was a sickly child, should die without male issue. The
Regent was not ignorant that Philip of Spain would
powerfully contest that succession, notwithstanding his
renunciation; and he was glad of an opportunity to
strengthen his interest by an alliance with the maritime
powers of England and Holland. The King of England
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded him on this subject, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound him eager to en∣gage
in such an association. The negociation was carried
<PB N="316" REF="322"/>
on by General Cadogan for England, the Abbé du Bois for
France, and the Pensionary Heinsius for the States-General.
The Regent readily compiled with all their demands. He
engaged that the Pretender should immediately depart from
Avignon to the other side of the Alps, and never return
to Lorraine or France on any pretence whatsoever: that no
rebellious subjects of Great-Britain should be allowed to re∣side
in that kingdom: and that the treaty of Utrecht, with
respect to the demolition of Dunkirk, should be fully exe∣cuted
to the satisfaction of his Britannick Majesty. The
treaty contained a mutual guarantee of all the places possess∣ed
by the contracting powers; of the protestant succession
on the throne of England, as well as that of the Duke of
Orleans to the crown of France; and a defensive alliance,
stipulating the proportion of ships and forces to be fur∣nished
to that power which should be disturbed at home
or invaded from abroad. The English people murmured
at this treaty. They said an unnecessary umbrage was
given to Spain, with which the nation had great com∣mercial
connexions; and that, on pretence of an invasion,
a body of foreign troops might be introduced to enslave the
kingdom.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. His Majesty was not so successful in his
endeavours to appease the King of Sweden, who refused
to listen to any overtures until Bremen and Verden should
be restored. These the Elector of Hanover resolved to
keep as a fair purchase; and he engaged in a confederacy
with the enemies of Charles, for the maintenance of this
acquisition. Mean while his rupture with Sweden was
extremely prejudicial to the commerce of England, and
had well nigh entailed upon the kingdom another invasion,
much more formidable than that which had so lately mis∣carried.
The ministers of Sweden resident at London,
Paris, and the Hague maintained a correspondence with
the disaffected subjects of Great-Britain. A scheme was
formed for the Swedish King's landing on this island with a
considerable body of forces, where he should be joined by
<PB N="317" REF="323"/>
the malcontents of the united kingdom. Charles relished
the enterprise, which flattered his ambition and revenge:
nor was it disagreeable to the Czar of Muscovy, who re∣sented
the Elector's offer of joining the Swede against the
Russians, provided he would ratify the cession of Bremen
and Verden. King George having received intimation of
these intrigues, returned to England towards the end of
January; and ordered a detachment of foot-guards to secure
Count Gyllenburg, the Swedish minister, with all his papers.
At the same time, Sir Jacob Bancks and Mr. Charles
Caesar were apprehended. The other foreign ministers
took the alarm, and remonstrated to the ministry upon this
outrage committed against the law of nations. The two
Secretaries, Stanhope and Methuen, wrote circular letters
to them, assuring them that in a day or two they should
be acquainted with the reasons that induced the King to
take such an extraordinary step. They were generally
satisfied with this intimation; but the Marquis de Monte∣leone,
ambassador from Spain, expressed his concern, that
no other way could be found to preserve the peace of the
kingdom, without arresting the person of a publick mini∣ster,
and seising all his papers, which were the sacred re∣positories
of his master's secrets: he observed, that in
whatever manner these two facts might seem to be under∣stood,
they very sensibly wounded the law of nations.
About the same time the Baron Gortz, the Swedish residen∣tiary
in Holland, was seised with his papers at Arnheim, at
the desire of King George, communicated to the States by
Mr. Leathes, his minister at the Hague. The Baron owned
he had projected the invasion, a design that was justified
by the conduct of King George, who had joined the
princes in confederacy against the King of Sweden, with∣out
having received the least provocation; who had assist∣ted
the King of Denmark in subduing the duchies of
Bremen and Verden, and then purchased them of the
usurper; and who had, in the course of this very summer,
sent a strong squadron of ships to the Baltick, where it
joined the Danes and Russians against the Swedish fleet.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="324"/>
§ XXXVIII. When the parliament of Great-Britain
met on the twentieth day of February, the King informed
them of the triple alliance he had concluded with France
and Holland. He mentioned the projected invasion; told
them he had given orders for laying before them copies
of the letters which had passed between the Swedish mini∣sters
on that subject; and he demanded of the Commons
such supplies as should be found necessary for the defence
of the kingdom. By those papers it appeared that the
scheme projected by Baron Gortz was very plausible, and
even ripe for execution; which, however, was postponed
until the army should be reduced, and the Dutch aux∣iliaries
sent back to their own country. The letters being
read in parliament, both Houses presented addresses, in
which they extolled the King's prudence in establishing
such conventions with foreign potentates as might repair
the gross defects, and prevent the pernicious consequences
of the treaty of Utrecht, which they termed a treacherous
and dishonourable peace: and they expressed their horrour
and indignation at the malice and ingratitude of those
who had encouraged an invasion of their country. He
likewise received an address of the same kind from the con∣vocation;
another from the dissenting ministers; a third
from the university of Cambridge; but Oxford was not
so lavish of her compliments. At a meeting of the Vice-Chancellor
and heads of that university, a motion was made
for an address to the King, on the suppression of the late
unnatural rebellion; his Majesty's safe return; and the
favour lately shown to the university, in omitting, at their
request, the ceremony of burning in effigy the devil, the
Pope, the Pretender, the Duke of Ormond, and the Earl
of Mar, on the anniversary of his Majesty's accession.
Dr. Smalridge, Bishop of Bristol, observed, that the
rebellion had been long suppressed; that there would be
no end to addresses, should one be presented every time
his Majesty returned from his German dominions: that
the late favour they had received was overbalanced by
a whole regiment now quartered upon them; and that
<PB N="319" REF="325"/>
there was no precedent in addressing a King upon his
return from his German dominions. The university
thought they had reason to complain of the little regard
paid to their remonstrance, touching a riot raised in that
city by the soldiers there quartered, on pretence that the
anniversary of the Prince's birth-day had not been cele∣brated
with the usual rejoicings. Affidavits had been sent
up to the council, which seemed to favour the officers of
the regiment. When the House of Lords deliberated upon
the mutiny-bill, by which the soldiers were exempted
from arrests for debts, complaint was made of their li∣centious
behaviour at Oxford; and a motion was made,
that they should enquire into the riot. The Lords pre∣sented
an address to the Queen, desiring that the papers
relating to that affair might be laid before the House.
These being perused, were found to be recriminations be∣tween
the Oxonians and the officers of the regiment. A
warm debate ensued, during which the Earl of Abingdon
offered a petition from the Vice-Chancellor of the univer∣sity,
the mayor and magistrates of Oxford, praying to be
heard. One of the court-members observing that it would
be irregular to receive a petition while the House was in a
grand committee, a motion was made, that the chairman
should leave the chair; but this was carried in the ne∣gative,
the debate was resumed, and the majority agreed
to the following resolutions: That the heads of the uni∣versity,
and mayor of the city, neglected to make publick
rejoicings on the Prince's birth-day: That the officers
having met to celebrate that day, the house in which they
had assembled was assaulted, and the windows were broken
by the rabble: That this assault was the beginning and
occasion of the riots that ensued: That the conduct of
the major seemed well justified by the affidavits produced
on his part: That the printing and publishing the depo∣sitions,
upon which the complaints relating to the riots at
Oxford were founded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals. State <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rials. Deb. in Par. Tindal Voltaire.</NOTE> while that matter was under the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xamination of the lords of the committee of the council,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd before they had time to come to any resolution
<PB N="320" REF="326"/>
touching the same, was irregular, disrespectful to his Royal
Highness, and tending to sedition. An enquiry of this
nature, so managed, did not much redound to the honour
of such an august assembly.</P>
<P>§ XXXIX. The Commons passed a bill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1717.</NOTE> prohibiting
all commerce with Sweden, a branch of trade which was
of the utmost consequence to the English merchants.
They voted ten thousand seamen for the ensuing year;
granted about a million for the maintenance of guards, gar∣risons,
and land-forces; and passed the bill relating to
mutiny and desertion. The House likewise voted four-and-twenty
thousand pounds for the payment of four bat∣talions
of Munster and two of Saxe-Gotha, which the King
had taken into his service, to supply the place of such as
might be, during the rebellion, drawn from the garrisons
of the States-General to the assistance of England. This
vote, however, was not carried without a violent debate▪
The demand was inveighed against as an imposition, see∣ing
no troops had ever served. A motion was made for
an address, desiring that the instructions of those who
concluded the treaties might be laid before the House:
but this was over-ruled by the majority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This year was rendered famous by a complete victory which Prince Eugene obtained over the Turks at Peterwaradin upon the Danube. The battle was fought on the fifth day of August. The Imperial army did not exceed sixty thousand men: that of the Infidels amounted to one hun∣dred and fifty thousand, commanded by the Grand Visi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, who was mor∣tally wounded in the engagement. The Infidels were totally defeated, with the loss of all their tents, artillery, and baggage; so that the victors obtained an immense booty.</NOTE> The supplies
was raised by a land-tax of three shillings in the pound,
and a malt-tax. What the Commons had given was not
thought sufficient for the expense of the year; therefore,
Mr. Secretary Stanhope brought a message from his Ma∣jesty,
demanding an extraordinary supply, that he might
be the better enabled to secure his kingdoms against the
danger with which they were threatened from Sweden;
and he moved that a supply should be granted to his Ma∣jesty
for this purpose. Mr. Shippen observed it was a
<PB N="321" REF="327"/>
great misfortune that the King was as little acquainted
with the parliamentary proceedings as with the lan∣guage
of the country:<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. I. 1717.</NOTE> that the message was unparlia∣mentary
and unprecedented; and, in his opinion, penned
by some foreign minister: he said he had been often
told that his Majesty had retrieved the honour and re∣putation
of the nation; a truth which appeared in the
flourishing condition of trade; but, that the supply de∣manded
seemed to be inconsistent with the glorious advan∣tages
which his Majesty had obtained for the people. He
was seconded by Mr. Hungerford, who declared that for
his part he could not understand what occasion there was
for new alliances; much less that they should be pur∣chased
with money. He expressed his surprise that a na∣tion
so lately the terror of France and Spain should now
seem to fear so inconsiderable an enemy as the King of
Sweden. The motion was supported by Mr. Boscawen,
Sir Gilbert Heathcote, and others: but some of the Whigs
spoke against it; and Mr. Robert Walpole was silent.
The Speaker, and Mr. Smith, one of the tellers of the
Exchequer, opposed this unparliamentary way of demand∣ing
the supply: the former proposed that part of the
army should be disbanded, and the money applied towards
the making good such new engagements as were deemed
necessary. After several successive debates, the resolution
for a supply was carried by a majority of four voices.</P>
<P>§ XL. The ministry was now divided within itself.
Lord Townshend had been removed from the office of se∣cretary
of state, by the intrigues of the Earl of Sunder∣land;
and he was now likewise dismissed from the place
of lord-lieutenant of Ireland. Mr. Robert Walpole re∣signed
his posts of first commissioner of the Treasury and
chancellor of the Exchequer: his example was followed
by Mr. Pulteney, secretary at war, and Mr. Methuen, se∣cretary
of state. When the affair of the supply was re∣sumed
in the House of Commons, Mr. Stanhope made a
motion for granting two hundred and fifty thousand pounds
for that purpose. Mr. Pulteney observed, that having
<PB N="322" REF="328"/>
resigned his place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1717.</NOTE> he might now act with the freedom
becoming an Englishman: he declared against the manner
of granting the supply, as unparliamentary and unprece∣dented.
He said he could not persuade himself that any
Englishman advised his Majesty to send such a message;
but he doubted not the resolution of a British parliament
would make a German ministry tremble. Mr. Stanhope
having harangued the House in vindication of the ministry,
Mr. Smith answered every article of his speech: he affirmed
that if an estimate of the conduct of the ministry in re∣lation
to affairs abroad was to be made from a comparison
of their conduct at home, they would not appear altogether
so faultless as they were represented. “Was it not a
mistake (said he) not to preserve the peace at home,
after the King had ascended the throne with the uni∣versal
applause and joyful acclamations of all his sub∣jects?
Was it not a mistake, upon the breaking out of
the rebellion, not to issue a proclamation, to offer par∣don
to such as should return home peaceably, according
to the custom on former occasions of the same nature?
Was it not a mistake, after the suppression of the rebel∣lion,
and the trial and execution of the principal au∣thors
of it, to keep up animosities, and drive people to
despair, by not passing an act of indemnity; by keeping
so many persons under hard and tedious consinement;
and by granting pardons to some, without leaving them
any means to subsist? Is it not a mistake, not to trust
to a vote of parliament, for making good such engage∣ments
as his Majesty should think proper to enter into;
and instead of that, to insist on the granting this supply
in such an extraordinary manner? Is it not a mistake, to
take this opportunity to create divisions, and render
some of the King's best friends suspected and obnoxious?
Is it not a mistake, in short, to form parites and cabals,
in order to bring in a bill to repeal the act of occasional
conformity?” A great number of members had agreed
to this measure in private, though at this period it was
not brought into the House of Commons. After a long
<PB N="323" REF="329"/>
debate the sum was granted. These were the first-fruits
of Britain's being wedded to the interests of the continent.
The Elector of Hanover quarrelled with the King of
Sweden; and England was not only deprived of a neces∣sary
branch of commerce, but even obliged to support
him in the prosecution of the war. The ministry now
underwent a new revolution. The Earl of Sunderland
and Mr. Addison were appointed secretaries of state: Mr.
Stanhope became first commissioner of the Treasury, and
chancellor of the Exchequer.</P>
<P>§ XLI. On the sixth day of May, the King, going to
the House of Peers, gave the parliament to understand,
that the fleet under Sir George Byng, which had sailed to
the Baltick, to observe the motions of the Swedes, was
safely arrived in the Sound. He said he had given orders
for the immediate reduction of ten thousand soldiers, as
well as directions to prepare an act of indemnity. He de∣sired
they would take proper measures for reducing the
publick debts with a just regard to parliamentary credit;
and that they would go through the public business with
all possible dispatch and unanimity. Some progress had
already been made in deliberations upon the debt of the
nation, which was comprehended under the two heads of
redeemable and irredeemable incumbrances. The first
had been contracted with a redeemable interest; and these
the publick had a right to discharge: the others con∣sisted
of long and short annuities granted for a greater or
less number of years, which could not be altered without
the consent of the proprietors. Mr. Robert Walpole had
projected a scheme for lessening the interest, and paying
the capital of those debts, before he resigned his place in
the Exchequer. He proposed, in the House of Commons,
to reduce the interest of redeemable funds, and offer an al∣ternative
to the proprietors of annuities. His plan was
approved; but, when he resigned his places, the ministers
made some small alterations in it, which furnished him with
a pretense for opposing the execution of the scheme. In
the course of the debate, some warm altercation passed
<PB N="324" REF="330"/>
between him and Mr. Stanhope, by which it appeared,
they had made a practice of selling places and reversions.
Mr. Hungerford, standing up, said he was sorry to see two
such great men running foul of one another: that, how∣ever,
they ought to be looked upon as patriots and fathers
of their country; and since they had by mischance dis∣covered
their nakedness, the other members ought, accord∣ing
to the custom of the East, to turn their backs upon
them, that they might not be seen in such a shameful
condition. Mr. Boscawen moved that the House would
lay their commands upon them, that no further notice
should be taken of what had passed. He was seconded by
Mr. Methuen: the House approved of the motion; and
the Speaker took their word and honour that they should
not prosecute their resentment. The money-corporations
having agreed to provide cash for such creditors as should
be willing to receive their principal, the House came to
certain resolutions, on which were founded the three bills
that passed into laws, under the names of “The South-Sea
act, the Bank act, and the General-fund act.” The
original stock of the South-Sea company did not exceed
nine millions four hundred and seventy-one thousand three
hundred and twenty-five pounds; but the funds granted
being sufficient to answer the interest of ten millions at
six per cent. the company made up that sum to the govern∣ment,
for which they received six hundred thousand pounds
yearly, and eight thousand pounds a-year for management.
By this act they declared themselves willing to receive five
hundred thousand pounds, and the eight thousand for ma∣nagement.
It was enacted, That the company should con∣tinue
a corporation, until the redemption of their annuity,
towards which not less than a million should be paid at a
time. They were likewise required to advance a sum not
exceeding two millions, towards discharging the principal
and interest due on the four lottery funds of the ninth
and tenth years of Queen Anne. By the Bank act the
governors and company declared themselves willing to
accept an annuity of eighty-eight thousand seven hundred
<PB N="325" REF="331"/>
and fifty-one pounds, seven shillings, and ten pence half∣penny,
or the principal of one million seven hundred and
seventy-five thousand twenty-seven pounds, seventeen shil∣lings,
and ten pence halfpenny, in lieu of the present
annuity, amounting to one hundred and six thousand five
hundred and one pounds, thirteen shillings, and five pence.
They likewise declared themselves willing to discharge,
and deliver up to be cancelled, as many Exchequer-bills
as amounted to two millions, and to accept of an annuity
of one hundred thousand pounds, being after the rate of
five per cent. redeemable after one year's notice; to cir∣culate
the remaining Exchequer-bills at three per cent.
and one penny per day. It was enacted, That the former
allowances should be continued to Christmas, and then
the Bank should have for circulating the two millions five
hundred and sixty-one thousand and twenty-five pounds
remaining Exchequer bills, an annuity of seventy-six
thousand eight hundred and thirty pounds, fifteen shillings,
at the rate of three pounds per cent. till redeemed, over
and above the one penny a-day for interest. By the same
act the Bank was required to advance a sum not exceed∣ing
two millions five hundred thousand pounds, towards
discharging the national debt, if wanted, on condition
that they should have five pounds per cent. for as much
as they might advance, redeemable by parliament. The
General-fund act recited the several acts of parliament, for
establishing the four lotteries in the ninth and tenth years
of the late Queen, and slated the annual produce of the
several funds, amounting in all to seven hundred twenty-four
thousand eight hundred forty-nine pounds, six shil∣lings,
and ten pence one fifth. This was the General-fund;
the deficiency of which was to be made good an∣nually,
out of the first aids granted by parliament. For
the regular payment of all such annuities as should be
made payable by this act, it was enacted, That all the
duties and revenues mentioned therein should continue
for ever, with the proviso, however, that the revenues
rendered by this act perpetual should be subject to
<PB N="326" REF="332"/>
redemption. This act contained a clause by which the
sinking fund was established. The reduction of interest
to five per cent. producing a surplus or excess upon the
appropriated funds, it was enacted, That all the monies
arising from time to time, as well for the surplus, by virtue
of the acts for redeeming the funds of the Bank and of the
South-Sea company, as also for the surplus of the duties
and revenues by this act appropriated to make good the
General-fund, should be appropriated and employed for
the discharging the principal and interest of such national
debt as was incurred before the twenty-fifth of December
of the preceding year, in such manner as should be directed
or appointed by any future act of parliament, to be dis∣charged
out of the same, and for none other use, intent, or
purpose whatsoever.</P>
<P>§ XLII. The Earl of Oxford, who had now remained
almost two years a prisoner in the Tower, presented a peti∣tion
to the House of Lords, praying that his imprisonment
might not be indefinite. Some of the Tory lords affirmed
that the impeachment was destroyed and determined
by the prorogation of parliament, which superseded the
whole proceedings; but the contrary was voted by a con∣siderable
majority. The thirteenth day of June was fixed
for the trial; and the House of Commons made acquainted
with this determination. The Commons appointed a
committee to enquire into the state of the Earl's impeach∣ment;
and, in consequence of their report, sent a message
to the Lords, demanding longer time to prepare for the trial.
Accordingly, the day was prolonged to the twenty-fourth
of June; and the Commons appointed the committee,
with four other members, to be the managers for making
good the articles of impeachment. At the appointed time,
the Peers repaired to the court in Westminister-hall, where
Lord Cowper presided as lord-steward. The Commons
were assembled as a committee of the whole House: the
King, the rest of the royal family, and the foreign mini∣sters,
assisted at the solemnity: the Earl of Oxford was
brought from the Tower: the articles of impeachment
<PB N="327" REF="333"/>
were read, with his answers, and the replication of the
Commons. Sir Joseph Jekyll standing up to make good
the first article, Lord Harcourt signified to their lordships
that he had a motion to make, and they adjourned to their
own house. There he represented, that a great deal of
time would be unnecessarily consumed in going through
all the articles of the impeachment: that if the Commons
would make good the two articles for high-treason, the
Earl of Oxford would forfeit both life and estate, and
there would be an end of the matter: whereas, to proceed
on the method proposed by the Commons would draw the
trial on to a prodigious length. He, therefore, moved that
the Commons might not be permitted to proceed, until
judgment should be first given upon the articles for high-treason.
He was supported by the Earls of Anglesey and
Nottingham, the Lord Trevor, and a considerable number
of both parties; and though opposed by the Earl of Sun∣derland,
the Lords Coningsby and Parker, the motion
was carried in the affirmative. It produced a dispute be∣tween
the two Houses. The Commons, at a conference,
delivered a paper, containing their reasons for asserting it
as their undoubted right to impeach a peer either for treason
or for high crimes and misdemeanours; or, should they see
occasion, to mix both in the same accusation. The
House of Lords insisted on their former resolution; and
in another conference delivered a paper, wherein they
asserted it to be a right inherent in every court of justice
to order and direct such methods of proceedings as it should
think sit to be observed in all causes that fall under its
cognizance. The Commons demanded a free conference,
which was refused. The dispute grew more and more
warm. The Lords sent a message to the Lower House,
importing, that they intended presently to proceed on the
trial of the Earl of Oxford. The Commons paid no
regard to this intimation; but adjourned to the third day
of July. The Lords, repairing to Westminister-hall, took
their places, ordered the Earl to be brought to the bar,
and made proclamation for his accusers to appear. Having
<PB N="328" REF="334"/>
waited a quarter of an hour, they adjourned to their own
house, where, after some debate, the Earl was acquitted
upon a division: then returning to the hall, they voted,
That he should be set at liberty. Oxford owned his safety
to the dissentions among the ministers, and to the late
change in the administration. In consequence of this, he
was delivered from the persecution of Walpole; and
numbered among his friends the Dukes of Devonshire and
Argyle, the Earls of Nottingham and Ilay, and Lord
Townshend. The Commons, in order to express their
sense of his demerit, presented an address to the King,
desiring he might be excepted out of the intended act of
grace. The King promised to comply with their request;
and in the mean time forbade the Earl to appear at court.
On the fifteenth day of July the Earl of Sunderland de∣livered
in the House of Peers the act of grace, which passed
through both Houses with great expedition. From this
indulgence were excepted the Earl of Oxford, Mr. Prior,
Mr. Thomas Harley, Mr. Arthur Moore; Crisp, Nodes,
Obryan, Redmayne the printer, and Thompson; as also
the assassinators in Newgate, and the clan of Mackgregor
in Scotland. By virtue of this act, the Earl of Carn∣wath,
the Lords Widdrington and Nairn were imme∣diately
discharged; together with all the gentlemen under
sentence of death in Newgate, and those that were con∣fined
on account of the rebellion in the Fleet, the Marshal∣sea,
and other prisons of the kingdom. The act of grace
being prepared for the royal assent, the King went to the
House of Peers on the fifteenth day of July, and having
given his sanction to all the bills that were ready, closed the
session with a speech on the usual topicks.</P>
<P>§ XLIII. The proceedings in the Convocation turned
chiefly upon two performances of Dr. Hoadley, Bishop of
Bangor. One was intituled, “A Preservative against
the Principles and Practices of the Nonjurors:”
the other was a sermon preached before the King, under
the title of, “The nature of the kingdom of Christ.”
An answer to this discourse was published by Dr. Snape,
<PB N="329" REF="335"/>
master of Eton college, and the convocation appointed a
committee to examine the Bishop's two performances.
They drew up a representation, in which the Preservative
and the sermon were censured, as tending to subvert all
government and discipline in the church of Christ; to
reduce his kingdom to a state of anarchy and confusion;
to impugn and impeach the royal supremacy in causes ec∣clesiastical,
and the authority of the legislature to enforce
obedience in matters of religion by civil sanctions. The
government thought proper to put a stop to these proceed∣ings
by a prorogation; which, however, inflamed the
controversy. A great number of pens were drawn against
the Bishop: but his chief antagonists were Dr. Snape and
Dr. Sherlock, whom the King removed from the office
of his chaplains; and the Convocation has not been per∣mitted
to sit and do business since that period.</P>

§ I. DURING these transactions, the negociations
of the North were continued against the King
of Sweden, who had penetrated into Norway, and ad∣vanced
towards Christianstadt, the capital of that king∣dom.
The Czar had sent five-and-twenty thousand
Russians to assist the allies in the reduction of Wismar,
which he intended to bestow upon his niece, lately married
to the Duke of Mecklenburg Schwerin: but, before his troops
arrived, the place had surrendered, and the Russians were
not admitted into the garrison; a circumstance which in∣creased
the misunderstanding between him and the King
of Great-Britain. Nevertheless, he consented to a project
for making a descent upon Schonen, and actually took
upon him the command of the allied fleet; though he
was not at all pleased to see Sir John Norris in the Baltick,
because he had formed designs against Denmark, which
he knew the English squadron would protect. He suddenly
desisted from the expedition against Schonen, on pretence
that the season was too far advanced; and the King of
Denmark published a manifesto, remonstrating against his
conduct on this occasion. By this time Baron Gortz
had planned a pacification between his master and the
Czar, who was discontented with all his German allies,
because they opposed his having any footing in the empire.
This monarch arrived at Amsterdam in December,
whither he was followed by the Czarina; and he actually
resided at the Hague when King George passed through it,
in return to his British dominions: but he declined an
interview with the King of England. When Gyllen∣burg's
letters were published in London, some passages
seemed to favour the supposition of the Czar's being
privy to the conspiracy. His minister at the English court
presented a long memorial, complaining that the King
had caused to be printed the malicious insinuations of his
enemies. He denied his having the least concern in the
design of the Swedish King. He charged the court of
England with having privately treated of a separate peace
with Charles, and even with having promised to assist him
<PB N="332" REF="338"/>
against the Czar, on condition that he would relinquish his
pretensions to Bremen and Verden. Nevertheless, he ex∣pressed
an inclination to re-establish the ancient good under∣standing,
and to engage in vigorous measures for prosecu∣ting
the war against the common enemy. The memorial
was answered by the King of Great-Britain, who assured
the Czar he should have reason to be fully satisfied, if he
would remove the only obstacle to their mutual good under∣standing;
in other words, withdraw the Russian troops
from the empire. Notwithstanding these professions, the
two monarchs were never perfectly reconciled.</P>
<P>§ II. The Czar made an excursion to the court of
France, where he concluded a treaty of friendship with the
regent, at whose earnest desire he promised to recall his
troops from Mecklenburgh. At his return to Amsterdam,
he had a private interview with Gortz, who, as well as
Gyllenburg, had been set at liberty. Gortz under∣took
to adjust all differences between the Czar and the
King of Sweden within three months; and Peter engaged
to suspend all operations against Sweden, until that term
should be expired. A congress was opened at Abo,
between the Swedish and Russian minister; but the con∣ferences
were afterwards removed to Aland. By this
convention, the Czar obliged himself to assist Charles in
the conquest of Norway; and they promised to unite all
their forces against the King of Great-Britain, should he
presume to interpose. Both were incensed against that
prince; and one part of their design was to raise the Pre∣tender
to the throne of England. Baron Gortz set out
from Aland for Frederickstadt in Norway, with the plan
of peace; but, before he arrived, Charles was killed by a
cannon-ball from the town, as he visited the trenches, on
the thirteenth of November. Baron Gortz was immediately
arrested, and brought to the scaffold by the nobles of
Sweden, whose hatred he had incurred by his insolence of
behaviour. The death of Charles was fortunate for King
George. Sweden was now obliged to submit: while the
<PB N="333" REF="339"/>
Czar, the King of Denmark, and the Elector of Hanover,
kept possession of what they had acquired in the course of
the war.</P>
<P>§ III. Thus Bremen and Verden were secured to the
house of Hanover; an acquisition towards which the
English nation contributed by her money, as well as by
her arms; an acquisition made in contradiction to the en∣gagements
into which England entered when King Wil∣liam
became guarantee for the treaty of Travendahl; an
acquisition that may be considered as the first link of a
political chain by which the English nation was dragged
back into expensive connexions with the continent. The
King had not yet received the investiture of the duchies;
and, until that should be procured, it was necessary to
espouse with warmth the interests of the Emperor. This
was another source of misunderstanding between Great-Britain
and Spain. Prince Eugene gained another complete
victory over a prodigious army of the Turks at Belgrade,
which was surrendered to him after the battle. The Em∣peror
had engaged in this war as an ally of the Venetians,
whom the Turks had attacked, and driven from the Morea.
The Pope considered it as a religious war against the In∣fidels;
and obtained repeated assurances from the King
of Spain, that he would not undertake any thing against
the Emperor, while he was engaged in such a laudable
quarrel. Philip had even sent a squadron of ships and gal∣lies
to the assistance of the Venetians. In the course of this
year, however, he equipped a strong armament, the com∣mand
of which he bestowed on the Marquis de Lede,
who sailed from Barcelona in July, and landing at Cag∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iari
in Sardinia, which belonged to the Emperor, made a
conquest of the whole island. At the same time, the King
of Spain endeavoured to justify these proceedings by a ma∣nifesto,
in which he alledged that the Archduke, con∣trary
to the faith of treaties, encouraged and supported
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he rebellion of his subjects in Catalonia, by frequent
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uccours from Naples, and other places; and that the
Great Inquisitor of Spain had been seised, though fur∣nished
<PB N="334" REF="340"/>
with a passport from his Holiness. He promised
however, to proceed no farther, and suspend all operations,
that the powers of Europe might have time and opportu∣nity
to contrive expedients for reconciling all differences,
and securing the peace and balance of power in Italy;
nay, he consented that this important affair should be left
to the arbitration of King George and the States-General.
These powers undertook the office. Conferences were be∣gun
between the ministers of the Emperor, France, Eng∣land,
and Holland; and these produced, in the course of
the following year, the famous quadruple alliance. In this
treaty it was stipulated, that the Emperor should re∣nounce
all pretensions to the crown of Spain, and ex∣change
Sardinia for Sicily, with the Duke of Savoy; that
the succession to the duchies of Tuscany, Parma, and Pla∣centia,
which the Queen of Spain claimed by inheritance,
as Princess of the house of Farnese, should be settled on
her eldest son, in case the present possessors should die
without male issue. Philip, dissatisfied with this partition,
continued to make formidable preparations by sea and land.
The King of England and the Regent of France interposed
their admonitions to no purpose. At length his Britannick
Majesty had recourse to more substantial arguments, and
ordered a strong squadron to be equipped with all possible
expedition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Pretender, who resided at Urbino, having received intelligence from Paris, that there was a design formed against his life, Pope Clement XI. gave directions that all foreigners in that neighbourhood, especially English, should be arrested. The Earl of Peterborough arriving at Bologna, with a few armed followers, was seised, with all his papers. Being interrogated, he said he came to pass some time in Italy, for the benefit of the air. He was close confined for a whole month in Fort Urbino, and his attendants were sent to prison. Nothing appearing to justify the suspicion, he was dismissed with uncommon civility. The King demanding reparation for this insult, the Pope wrote with his own hand a letter to an ally of Great-Bri∣tain, declaring that the Legate of Bologna had violently and unjustly, with∣out the knowledge of his Holiness, caused the Earl of Peterborough to be seised upon suspicions which proved to be ill-grounded. The Cardinal-Legate sent a declaration to the English admiral in the Mediterranea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that he had asked forgiveness of his Holiness, and now begged pardon of his Britannick Majesty, for having unadvisedly arrested a peer of Great Britain on his travels.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="341"/>
§ IV. On the third day of November, the Princess of
Wales was delivered of a prince, the ceremony of whose
baptism was productive of a difference between the grand∣father
and the father. The Prince of Wales intended
that his uncle, the Duke of York, should stand godfather.
The King ordered the Duke of Newcastle to stand for
himself. After the ceremony, the Prince expressed his re∣sentment
against this nobleman in very warm terms. The
King ordered the Prince to confine himself within his own
apartments; and afterwards signified his pleasure that he
should quit the palace of St. James's. He retired with the
Princess to a house belonging to the Earl of Grantham;
but the children were detained at the palace. All peers
and peeresses, and all privy-counsellors and their wives,
were given to understand, that in case they visited the
Prince and Princess, they should have no access to his
Majesty's presence; and all who enjoyed posts and places
under both King and Prince were obliged to quit the
service of one or other, at their option. When the par∣liament
met on the twenty-first day of November, the
King, in his speech, told both Houses that he had reduced
the army to very near one half, since the beginning of the
last session; he expressed his desire that all those who were
friends to the present happy establishment might unani∣mously
concur in some proper method for the greater
strengthening the protestant interest, of which, as the
church of England was unquestionably the main support
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd bulwark, so would she reap the principal benefit of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>very advantage accruing from the union and mutual cha∣rity
of all protestants. After the addresses of thanks,
which were couched in the usual style, the Commons
proceeded to take into consideration the estimates and ac∣counts,
in order to settle the establishment of the army,
Navy, and Ordnance. Ten thousand men were voted for
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e sea-service. When the supply for the army fell under
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eliberation, a very warm debate ensued, upon the num∣ber
of troops necessary to be maintained. Sir William
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yndham, Mr. Shippen, and Mr. Walpole, in a long
<PB N="336" REF="342"/>
elaborate harangue, insisted upon its being reduced to twelve
thousand. They were answered by Mr. Craggs, secretary
at war, and Sir David Dalrymple. Mr. Shippen, in the
course of the debate, said the second paragraph of the King's
speech seemed rather to be calculated for the meridian of
Germany than for Great-Britain; and it was a great mis∣fortune
that the King was a stranger to our language and
constitution. Mr. Lechmere affirmed this was a scandalous
invective against the King's person and government; and
moved that he who uttered it should be sent to the Tower.
Mr. Shippen, refusing to retract or excuse what he had said,
was voted to the Tower by a great majority; and the num∣ber
of standing forces was fixed at sixteen thousand three
hundred and forty-seven effective men.</P>
<P>§ V. On account of the great scarcity of silver coin,
occasioned by the exportation of silver, and the importation
of gold, a motion was made to put a stop to this growing
evil, by lowering the value of gold specie. The Com∣mons
examined a representation which had been made to
the Treasury by Sir Isaac Newton, master of the Mint,
on this subject. Mr. Caswel explained the nature of a
clandestine trade carried on by the Dutch and Ham∣burghers,
in concert with the Jews of England and other
traders, for exporting the silver coin and importing gold,
which being coined at the Mint, yielded a profit of fifteen
pence upon every guinea. The House, in an address to
the King, desired that a proclamation might be issued,
forbidding all persons to utter or receive guineas at a higher
rate than one-and-twenty shillings each. His Majesty
complied with their request: but people hoarding up their
silver, in hopes that the price of it would be raised, or
in apprehension that the gold would be lowered still far∣ther,
the two Houses resolved that the standard of the gold
and silver coins of the kingdom should not be altered in
fineness, weight, or denomination; and they ordered a bill
to be brought in, to prevent the melting down of the silver
coin. At this period, one James Shepherd, a youth of
<PB N="337" REF="343"/>
eighteen, apprentice to a coachmaker, and an enthusiast in
Jacobitism, sent a letter to a nonjuring clergyman, pro∣posing
a scheme for assassinating King George. He was
immediately apprehended, owned the design, was tried,
condemned, and executed at Tyburn. This was likewise
the fate of the Marquis de Palleotti, an Italian nobleman,
brother to the Duchess of Shrewsbury. He had, in a
transport of passion, killed his own servant, and seemed
indeed to be disordered in his brain. After he had received
sentence of death, the King's pardon was earnestly solli∣cited
by his sister, the Duchess, and many other persons
of the first distinction; but the common people became
so clamorous, that it was thought dangerous to rescue
him from the penalties of the law, which he accordingly
underwent in the most ignominious manner. No subject
produced so much heat and altercation in parliament dur∣ing
this session, as did the bill for regulating the land∣forces,
and punishing mutiny and desertion; a bill which
was looked upon as an encroachment upon the liberties
and constitution of England, inasmuch as it established
martial law, which wrested from the civil magistrate the
cognizance of crimes and misdemeanours committed by the
soldiers and officers of the army: a jurisdiction inconsistent
with the genius and disposition of the people. The dan∣gers
that might accrue from such a power were explained
in the Lower House by Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Harley, and
Mr. Robert Walpole, which last, however, voted after∣wards
for the bill. In the House of Lords, it was strenu∣ously
opposed by the Earls of Oxford, Strafford, and Lord
Harcourt. Their objections were answered by Lort
Carterect. The bill passed by a great majority; but divers
lords entered a protest. This affair being discussed, a bill
was brought in for vesting in trustees the forfeited estates
in Britain and Ireland, to be sold for the use of the pub∣lick;
for giving relief to lawful creditors, by determining
the claims; and for the more effectual bringing into the
respective exchequers the rents and profits of the estates
till sold. The time of claiming was prolonged: the sum
<PB N="338" REF="344"/>
of twenty thousand pounds was reserved out of the sale of
the estates in Scotland, for erecting schools; and eight
thousand pounds for building barracks in that kingdom.
The King having signified,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oldmixon.</NOTE> by a message to the House of
Commons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals.</NOTE> that he had lately received such information
from abroad,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lamberty.</NOTE> as gave reason to believe that a naval force,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burchet.</NOTE>
employed where it should be necessary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. Reg.</NOTE> would give weight
to his endeavours;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tindal.</NOTE> he,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State Trials.</NOTE> therefore, thought fit to acquaint

in case he should be obliged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boling broke Lives of the Admirals.</NOTE> at this critical juncture, to
exceed the number of men granted this year for the sea-service,
the House would provide for such exceeding.
The Commons immediately drew up and presented an
address, assuring his Majesty that they would make good
such exceedings of seamen as he should find necessary to
preserve the tranquillity of Europe. On the twenty-first
day of March, the King went to the House of Peers, and,
having passed the bills that were ready for the royal assent,
ordered the parliament to be prorogued<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Earl Cowper, lord-chancellor, resigned the great seal, which was at first put in commission, but afterwards given to Lord Parker, as high chancellor.

<P>§ VI. The King of Spain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1718.</NOTE> by the care and indefati∣gable
diligence of his prime minister, Cardinal Alberoni,
equipped a very formidable armament, which, in the be∣ginning
of June, set sail from Barcelona towards Italy;
but the destination of it was not known. A strong squa∣dron
having been fitted out in England, the Marquis de
Monteleone, ambassador from Spain, presented a memo∣rial
to the British ministry, importing that so powerful an
armament in time of peace could not but give umbrage to
the King his master, and alter the good intelligence that
subsisted between the two crowns. In answer to this re∣presentation,
the ministers declared that the King intend∣ed
to send Admiral Byng with a powerful squadron into
the Mediterranean, to maintain the neutrality in Italy.
<PB N="339" REF="345"/>
Mean while,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. II. 1718.</NOTE> the negociations between the English and
French ministers produced the quadruple alliance, by
which King George and the Regent prescribed a peace
between the Emperor, the King of Spain, and the King
of Sicily, and undertook to compel Philip and the Savoy∣ard
to submit to such conditions as they had concerted
with his Imperial Majesty. These powers were allowed
only three months to consider the articles, and declare
whether they would reject them, or acquiesce in the par∣tition.
Nothing could be more contradictory to the true
interest of Great-Britain than this treaty, which destroyed
the balance in Italy, by throwing such an accession of
power into the hands of the House of Austria. It inter∣rupted
the commerce with Spain; involved the kingdom
in an immediate war with that monarchy; and gave rise
to all the quarrels and disputes which have arisen between
England and Spain in the sequel. The States-General did
not approve of such violent measures, and for some
time kept aloof: but at length they acceded to the qua∣druple
alliance, which indeed was no other than a very
expensive compliment to the Emperor, who was desirous
of adding Sicily to his other Italian dominions.</P>
<P>§ VII. The King of England had used some endeavours
to compromise the difference between his Imperial Ma∣jesty
and the Spanish branch of the House of Bourbon.
Lord Stanhope had been sent to Madrid with a plan of
pacification, which being rejected by Philip, as partial
and iniquitious, the King determined to support his me∣diation
by force of arms. Sir George Byng sailed from
Spithead on the fourth day of June, with twenty ships of
the line, two fire-ships, two bomb-vessels, and ample in∣structions
how to act on all emergencies. He arrived off
Cape St. Vincent on the thirtieth day of the month, and
dispatched his secretary to Cadiz, with a letter to Colonel
Stanhope, the British minister at Madrid, desiring him to
inform his Most Catholick Majesty of the admiral's arrival
in those parts, and lay before him this article of his in∣structions: “You are to make instances with both parties”
<PB N="340" REF="346"/>
“to cease from using any further acts of hostility:<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1718.</NOTE> but
in case the Spaniards do still insist, with their ships of
war and forces, to attack the kingdom of Naples, or
other the territories of the Emperor in Italy, or to land
in any part of Italy, which can only be with a design
to invade the Emperor's dominions, against whom only
they have declared war by invading Sardinia; or if
they should endeavour to make themselves masters of
the kingdom of Sicily, which must be with a design to
invade the kingdom of Naples; in which case you are,
with all your power, to hinder and obstruct the same.
If it should so happen, that at your arrival, with our
fleet under your command, in the Mediterranean, the
Spaniards should already have landed any troops in
Italy, in order to invade the Emperor's territories, you
shall endeavour amicably to dissuade them from perse∣vering
in such an attempt, and offer them your assist∣ance
to help them to withdraw their troops, and put
an end to all further acts of hostility. But in case
these your friendly endeavours should prove ineffectual,
you shall, by keeping company with, or intercepting
their ships or convoy; or, if it be necessary, by openly
opposing them, defend the Emperor's territories from
any further attempt.” When Cardinal Alberoni pe∣rused
these instructions, he told Colonel Stanhope, with
some warmth, that his master would run all hazards, and
even suffer himself to be driven out of Spain, rather than
recall his troops, or consent to a suspension of arms. He
said the Spaniards were not to be frightened; and he was
so well convinced that the fleet would do their duty, that
in case of their being attacked by Admiral Byng, he should
be in no pain for the success. Mr. Stanhope presenting
him with a list of the British squadron, he threw it upon
the ground with great emotion. He promised, however,
to lay the admiral's letter before the King, and to let the
envoy know his Majesty's resolution. Such an inter∣position
could not but be very provoking to the Spanish
minister, who had laid his account with the conquest of
<PB N="341" REF="347"/>
Sicily, and for that purpose prepared an armament which
was altogether surprising, considering the late shattered
condition of the Spanish affairs. But he seems to have
put too much confidence in the strength of the Spanish
fleet. In a few days he sent back the admiral's letter to
Mr. Stanhope, with a note under it, importing, that the
Chevalier Byng might execute the orders he had received
from the King his master.</P>
<P>§ VIII. The admiral, in passing by Gibraltar, was
joined by Vice-Admiral Cornwall, with two ships. He
proceeded to Minorca, where he relieved the garrison of
Port-Mahon. Then he sailed for Naples, where he arrived
on the first day of August, and was received as a deliverer;
for the Neapolitans had been under the utmost terror of
an invasion from the Spaniards. Sir George Byng re∣ceived
intelligence from the viceroy, Count Daun, who
treated him with the most distinguishing marks of respect,
that the Spanish army, amounting to thirty thousand men,
commanded by the Marquis de Lede, had landed in Sicily,
reduced Palermo and Messina, and were then employed in
the siege of the citadel belonging to this last city: that
the Piedmontese garrison would be obliged to surrender,
if not speedily relieved: that an alliance was upon the
carpet between the Emperor and the King of Sicily, which
last had desired the assistance of the Imperial troops, and
agreed to receive them into the citadel of Messina. The
admiral immediately resolved to sail thither, and took under
his convoy a re-enforcement of two thousand Germans for
the citadel, under the command of General Wetzel. He
forthwith sailed from Naples, and on the ninth day of
August was in sight of the Faro of Messina. He dispatched
his own captain, with a polite message to the Marquis de
Lede, proposing a cessation of arms in Sicily for two
months, that the powers of Europe might have time to
concert measures for restoring a lasting peace; and de∣claring,
that should this proposal be rejected, he would, in
pursuance of his instructions, use all his force to prevent
further attempts to disturb the dominions his master had
<PB N="342" REF="348"/>
engaged to defend. The Spanish general answered, that
he had no powers to treat, consequently could not agree
to an armistice, but should obey his orders, which directed
him to reduce Sicily for his master the King of Spain.
The Spanish fleet had sailed from the harbour of Messina
on the day before the English squadron appeared. Admiral
Byng supposed they had retired to Malta, and directed
his course towards Messina, in order to encourage and
support the garrison in the citadel. But, in doubling
the point of Faro, he descried two Spanish scouts, and
learned from the people of a felucca from the Calabrian
shore, that they had seen from the hills the Spanish fleet
lying to in order of battle. The admiral immediately
detached the German troops to Reggio, under convoy of
two ships of war. Then he stood through the Faro after
the Spanish scouts that led him to their main fleet, which
before noon he descried in line of battle, amounting to
seven-and-twenty sail large and small, besides two fire-ships,
four bomb-vessels, and seven gallies. They were
commanded in chief by Don Antonio de Castanita, under
whom were the four rear-admirals Chacon, Mari, Gue∣vara,
and Cammock. At sight of the English squadron,
they stood away large, and Byng gave chace all the rest of
the day. In the morning, which was the eleventh of Au∣gust,
Rear-Admiral de Mari, with six ships of war,
the gallies, fire-ships, and bomb-ketches, separated from
the main fleet, and stood in for the Sicilian shore. The
English admiral detached Captain Walton with five ships
in pursuit of them, and they were soon engaged. He
himself continued to chase their main fleet; and about ten
o'clock the battle began. The Spaniards seemed to be
distracted in their councils, and acted in confusion. They
made a running sight; yet the admirals behaved with
courage and activity, in spite of which they were all taken,
except Cammock, who made his escape with three ships
of war and three frigates. In this engagement, which
happened off Cape Passaro, Captain Haddock, of the
Graston, signalised his courage in an extraordinary man∣ner,
<PB N="343" REF="349"/>
On the eighteenth the admiral received a letter from
Captain Walton, dated off Syracuse, intimating that he had
taken four Spanish ships of war, together with a bomb-ketch,
and a vessel laden with arms: and that he had burn∣ed
four ships of the line, a fire-ship, and a bomb-vessel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This letter is justly deemed a curious specimen of the laconick style.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>“<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have taken and destroyed all the Spanish Ships and vessels which were upon the coast; the number as per margin. I am, &amp;c.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>G. WALTON.</SIGNED>”</CLOSER>
</LETTER></NOTE>.
Had the Spaniards followed the advice of Rear-Admiral
Cammock, who was a native of Ireland, Sir George Byng
would not have obtained such an easy victory. That officer
proposed that they should remain at anchor in the road of
Paradise, with their broadsides to the sea; in which case
the English admiral would have found it a very difficult task
to attack them: for the coast is so bold, that the largest
ships could ride with a cable ashore; whereas farther out
the currents are so various and rapid, that the English squa∣dron
could not have come to anchor, or lie near them in
order of battle: besides, the Spaniards might have been re∣enforced
from the army on shore, which would have raised
batteries to annoy the assailants. Before King George had
received an account of this engagement from the admiral,
he wrote him a letter with his own hand, approving his
conduct. When Sir George's eldest son arrived in Eng∣land,
with a circumstantial account of the action, he was
graciously received, and sent back with plenipotentiary
powers to his father, that he might negociate with the se∣veral
princes and states of Italy, as he should see occasion.
The son likewise carried the King's royal grant to the offi∣cers
and seamen, of all the prizes they had taken from the
Spaniards. Notwithstanding this victory, the Spanish
army carried on the siege of the citadel of Messini with
such vigour, that the governour surrendered the place by
capitulation on the twenty-ninth day of September. A
treaty was now concluded at Vienna between the Empe∣ror
<PB N="344" REF="350"/>
and the Duke of Savoy. They agreed to form an ar∣my
for the conquest of Sardinia in behalf of the Duke; and
in the mean time this prince engaged to evacuate Sicily;
but until his troops could be conveyed from that island,
he consented that they should co-operate with the Germans
against the common enemy. Admiral Byng continued to
assist the Imperialists in Sicily, during the best part of the
winter, by scouring the seas of the Spaniards, and keeping
the communication open between the German forces and
the Calabrian shore, from whence they were supplied with
provisions. He acted in this service with equal conduct,
resolution, and activity. He conferred with the viceroy
of Naples, and the other Imperial generals, about the opera∣tions
of the ensuing campaign, and Count Hamilton was
dispatched to Vienna, to lay before the Emperor the result
of their deliberations: then the admiral set sail for Mahon,
where his ships might be resitted, and put in a condition
to take the sea in the spring.</P>
<P>§ IX. The destruction of the Spanish fleet was a subject
that employed the deliberations and conjectures of all the
politicians in Europe. Spain exclaimed against the con∣duct
of England, as inconsistent with the rules of good
faith, for the observation of which she had always been
so famous. The Marquis de Monteleone wrote a letter
to Mr. Secretary Craggs, in which he expostulated with
him upon such an unprecedented outrage. Cardinal Al∣beroni,
in a letter to that minister, inveighed against it as
a base, unworthy action. He said the neutrality of Italy
was a weak pretence, since every body knew that neu∣trality
had long been at an end; and that the princes gua∣rantees
of the treaty of U<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>recht were entirely discharged
from their engagements, not only by the scandalous in∣fringements
committed by the Austrians in the evacuation
of Catalonia and Majorca; but also because the guarantee
was no longer binding than till a peace was concluded
with France. He taxed the British ministry with having
revived and supported this neutrality, not by an amicable
<PB N="345" REF="351"/>
mediation, but by open violence, and artfully abusing the
confidence and security of the Spaniards. This was the
language of disappointed ambition. Nevertheless, it must
be owned, that the conduct of England, on this occasion,
was irregular, partial, and precipitate.</P>
<P>§ X. The parliament meeting on the eleventh day of
November, the King, in his speech, declared that the
court of Spain had rejected all his amicable proposals, and
broke through their most solemn engagements for the
security of the British commerce. To vindicate, there∣fore,
the faith of his former treaties, as well as to maintain
those he had lately made, and to protect and defend the
trade of his subjects, which had in every branch been
violently and unjustly oppressed, it became necessary for his
naval forces to check their progress: that, notwithstanding
the success of his arms, that court had lately given orders
at all the ports of Spain and of the West-Indies, to sit
out privateers against the English. He said he was persuad∣ed
that a British parliament would enable him to resent
such treatment; and he assured them that his good brother,
the Regent of France, was ready to concur with him in the
most vigorous measures. A strong opposition was made
in both Houses to the motion for an address of thanks and
congratulation proposed by Lord Carteret. Several peers
observed, that such an address was, in effect, to approve
a sea-fight which might be attended with dangerous con∣sequences,
and to give the sanction of that august assembly
to measures which, upon examination, might appear either
to clash with the law of nations, or former treaties, or to
be prejudicial to the trade of Great-Britain: that they
ought to proceed with the utmost caution and maturest
deliberation, in an affair wherein the honour, as well as
the interest of the nation were so highly concerned.
Lord Strafford moved for an address, that Sir George
Byng's instructions might be laid before the House. Earl
Stanhope replied, that there was no occasion for such an
address, since by his Majesty's command he had already
laid before the House the treaties, of which the late sea-fight
<PB N="346" REF="352"/>
was a consequence: particularly the treaty for a de∣fensive
alliance between the Emperor and his Majesty, con∣cluded
at Westminster on the twenty-fifth day of May,
in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixteen; and
the treaty of alliance for restoring and settling the publick
peace, signed at London on the twenty-second day of
July. He affirmed that the court of Spain had violated
the treaty of Utrecht, and acted against the publick faith,
in attacking the Emperor's dominions, while he was en∣gaged
in a war against the enemies of Christendom: that
they had rejected his Majesty's friendly offices and offers
for mediating an accommodation. He explained the
cause of his own journey to Spain, and his negociations at
Madrid. He added, it was high time to check the growth
of the naval power of Spain, in order to protect and se∣cure
the trade of the British subjects, which had been vio∣lently
oppressed by the Spaniards. After a long debate,
the motion was carried by a considerable majority. The
same subject excited disputes of the same nature in the
House of Commons, where Lord Hinchingbroke moved
that, in their address of thanks, they should declare their
entire satisfaction in those measures which the King had
already taken for strengthening the protestant succession,
and establishing a lasting tranquillity in Europe. The mem∣bers
in the opposition urged that it was unparliamentary
and unprecedented, on the first day of the session, to enter
upon particulars: that the business in question was of the
highest importance, and deserved the most mature delibe∣ration;
that, before they approved the measures which had
been taken, they ought to examine the reasons on which
those measures were founded. Mr. Robert Walpole af∣firmed,
that the giving sanction, in the manner proposed,
to the late measures, could have no other view than that
of screening ministers, who were conscious of having be∣gun
a war against Spain, and now wanted to make it the
parliament's war. He observed that, instead of an entire
satisfaction, they ought to express their entire dissatisfaction
with such conduct as was contrary to the law of nations,
<PB N="347" REF="353"/>
and a breach of the most solemn treaties. Mr. Secretary
Craggs, in a long speech, explained the nature of the qua∣druple
alliance, and justified all the measures which had
been taken. The address, as moved by Lord Hinching∣broke,
was at length carried, and presented to his Majesty.
Then the Commons proceeded to consider the supply.
They voted thirteen thousand five hundred sailors; and
twelve thousand four hundred thirty-five men for the
land-service. The whole estimate amounted to two mil∣lions
two hundred and fifty-seven thousand five hundred
eighty-one pounds, nineteen shillings. The money was
raised by a land-tax, malt-tax, and lottery.</P>
<P>§ XI. On the thirteenth day of December, Earl Stan∣hope
declared, in the House of Lords, that, in order to
unite the hearts of the well-affected to the present estab∣lishment,
he had a bill to offer, under the title of “An act
for strengthening the protestant interest in these king∣doms.”
It was accordingly read, and appeared to be a
bill repealing the acts against occasional conformity, the
growth of schism, and some clauses in the corporation
and test acts. This had been concerted by the ministry,
in private meetings with the most eminent dissenters.
The Tory lords were astonished at this motion, for which
they were altogether unprepared. Nevertheless, they
were strenuous in their opposition. They alledged that
the bill, instead of strengthening, would certainly weaken
the church of England, by plucking off her best feathers,
investing her enemies with power, and sharing with church∣men
the civil and military employments of which they
were then wholly possessed. Earl Cowper declared him∣self
against that part of the bill by which some clauses of
the test and corporation acts were repealed; because he
looked upon those acts as the main bulwark of our excel∣lent
constitution in church and state, which ought to be
inviolably preserved. The Earl of Ilay opposed the bill,
because, in his opinion, it infringed the <HI>pacta conventa</HI> of
the treaty of union, by which the bounds both of the
church of England and of the church of Scotland were
<PB N="348" REF="354"/>
fixed and settled; and he was apprehensive, if the articles
of the Union were broke with respect to one church, it
might afterwards be a precedent to break them with re∣spect
to the other. The Archbishop of Canterbury said
the acts which by this bill would be repealed were the
main bulwark and supporters of the English church: he
expressed all imaginable tenderness for well-meaning
conscientious dissenters; but he could not forbear saying
some among that sect made a wrong use of the favour and
indulgence shown to them at the Revolution, though they
had the least share in that happy event: it was, therefore,
thought necessary for the legislature to interpose, and put
a stop to the scandalous practice of occasional conformity.
He added, that it would be needless to repeat the act against
schism, since no advantage had been taken of it, to the
prejudice of the dissenters. Dr. Hoadley, Bishop of Ban∣gor,
endeavoured to prove that the occasional and schism
acts were in effect persecuting laws; and that by admit∣ting
the principle of self-defence and self-preservation, in
matters of religion, all the persecutions maintained by the
heathens against the professors of Christianity, and even
the popish Inquisition, might be justified. With respect to
the power of which many clergymen appeared so sond and
so zealous, he owned the desire of power and riches was
natural to all men; but that he had learned both from
reason and from the gospel, that this desire must be kep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
within due bounds, and not entrench upon the rights and
liberties of their fellow-creatures and countrymen. After
a long debate, the House agreed to leave out some clauses
concerning the test and corporation acts: then the bill
was committed, and afterwards passed. In the Lower
House it met with violent opposition, in spite of which it
was carried by the majority.</P>
<P>§ XII. The King, on the seventeenth day of Decem∣ber,
sent a message to the Commons, importing that all
his endeavours to procure redress for the injuries done to
his subjects by the King of Spain having proved ineffec∣tual,
he had found it necessary to declare war against that
<PB N="349" REF="355"/>
monarch. When a motion was made for an address,
to assure the King they would chearfully support him in
the prosecution of the war, Mr Shippen and some other
members said they did not see the necessity of involving
the nation in a war on account of some grievances of
which the merchants complained, as these might be amica∣bly
redressed. Mr. Stanhope assured the House, that he
had presented five-and-twenty memorials to the ministry
of Spain on that subject, without success. Mr. Methuen
accounted for the dilatory proceeding of the Spanish court
in commercial affairs, by explaining the great variety of
regulations in the several provinces and ports of that king∣dom.
It was suggested, that the ministry paid very little
regard to the trade and interest of the nation; inasmuch
as it appeared by the answer from a secretary of state to
the letter of the Marquis de Monteleone, that they would
have overlooked the violation of the treaties of commerce,
provided Spain had accepted the conditions stipulated in
the quadruple alliance; for it was there expressly said
that his Majesty, the King of Great-Britain, did not seek
to aggrandise himself by any new acquisition, but was ra∣ther
inclined to sacrifice something of his own to procure
the general quiet and tranquillity of Europe. A member
observed that nobody could tell how far that sacrifice
would have extended; but certainly it was a very uncom∣mon
stretch of condescension. This sacrifice was said to
be the cession of Gibraltar and Port-Mahon, which the Re∣gent
of France had offered to the King of Spain, provided
he would accede to the quadruple alliance. Horatio Wal∣pole
observed, that the disposition of Sicily in favour of
the Emperor was an infraction of the treaty of Utrecht;
and his brother exclaimed against the injustice of attack∣ing
the Spanish sleet before a declaration of war. Not∣withstanding
all these arguments and objections, the ma∣jority
agreed to the address; and such another was carried
in the Upper House without a division. The declaration
of war against Spain was published with the usual solem∣nities;
but this war was not a favourite of the people, and,
<PB N="350" REF="356"/>
therefore, did not produce those acclamations that were
usual on such occasions.</P>
<P>§ XIII. Mean while Cardinal Alberoni employed all his
intrigues, power, and industry, for the gratification of his
revenge. He caused new ships to be built, the sea-ports
to be put in a posture of defence, succours to be sent to
Sicily, and the proper measures to be taken for the security
of Sardinia. He, by means of the Prince de Cellamare,
the Spanish ambassador at Paris, caballed with the mal∣contents
of that kingdom, who were numerous and power∣ful.
A scheme was actually formed for seising the Regent,
and securing the person of the King. The Duke of Or∣leans
owed the first intimation of this plot to King
George, who gave him to understand, that a conspiracy
was formed against his person and government. The Re∣gent
immediately took measures for watching the conduct
of all suspected persons; but the whole intrigue was dis∣covered
by accident. The Prince de Cellamare entrusted
his dispatches to the Abbé Portocarrero, and to a son of the
Marquis de Monteleone. These emissaries set out from
Paris in a post-chaise, and were overturned. The postillion
overheard Portocarrero say he would not have lost his
portmanteau for a hundred thousand pistoles. The man,
at his return to Paris, gave notice to the government of
what he had observed. The Spaniards being pursued,
were overtaken and seised at Poitiers, with the portman∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eau,
in which the Regent found two letters that made
him acquainted with the particulars of the conspiracy.
The Prince de Cellamare was immediately conducted to
the frontiers: the Duke of Maine, the Marquis de Pom∣padour,
the Cardinal de Polignac, and many other persons
of distinction, were committed to different prisons. The
Regent declared war against Spain, on the twenty-ninth
day of December; and an army of six-and-thirty thousand
men began its march towards that kingdom in January,
under the command of the Duke of Berwick.</P>
<P>§ XIV. Cardinal Alberoni had likewise formed a scheme
in savour of the Pretender. The Duke of Ormond
<PB N="351" REF="357"/>
repairing to Madrid, held conferences with his eminence;
and measures were concerted for exciting another insur∣rection
in Great-Britain. The Chevalier de St. George
quitted Urbino by stealth; and embarking at Nettuno,
landed at Cagliari in March. From thence he took his
passage to Roses in Catalonia, and proceeded to Madrid,
where he was received with great cordiality, and treated
as King of Great-Britain. An armament had been equip∣ped
of ten ships of war and transports, having on board
six thousand regular troops, with arms for twelve thousand
men. The command of this fleet was bestowed on the
Duke of Ormond, with the title of Captain-General of
his Most Catholick Majesty. He was provided with de∣clarations
in the name of that king, importing that for
many good reasons he had sent part of his land and sea
forces into England and Scotland, to act as auxiliaries to
King James. His Britannick Majesty, having received
from the Regent of France timely notice of this intended
invasion, offered, by proclamation, rewards to those that
should apprehend the Duke of Ormond, or any gentleman
embarked in that expedition. Troops were ordered to
assemble in the north, and in the west of England: two
thousand men were demanded of the States-General: a
strong squadron was equipped to oppose the Spanish arma∣ment;
and the Duke of Orleans made a proffer to King
George of twenty battalions for his service.</P>
<P>§ XV. His Majesty having communicated to both
Houses of parliament the repeated advices he had received
touching this projected descent, they promised to support
him against all his enemies. They desired he would aug∣ment
his forces by sea and land; and assured him they
would make good the extraordinary expense. Two thou∣sand
men were landed from Holland, and six battalions
of Imperialists from the Austrian Netherlands. The Duke
of Ormond sailed from Cadiz, and proceeded as far as
Cape Finisterre, where his fleet was dispersed and disabled
by a violent storm, which entirely defeated the purposed
expedition. Two frigates, however, arrived in Scotland,
<PB N="352" REF="358"/>
with the Earls Marischal and Seaforth, the Marquis of
Tullibardine, some field-officers, three hundred Spaniards,
and arms for two thousand men. They were joined by
a small body of Highlanders, and possessed themselves of
Donan Castle. Against these adventurers General Wight∣man
marched with a body of regular troops from Inverness.
They had taken possession of the pass of Glenshiel; but, at
the approach of the King's forces, retired to the pass at
Strachell, which they resolved to defend. They were at∣tacked
and driven from one eminence to another till
night, when the Highlanders dispersed; and next day the
Spaniards surrendered themselves prisoners of war. Ma∣rischal,
Seaforth, and Tullibardine, with some officers,
retired to one of the western isles, in order to wait for an
opportunity of being conveyed to the continent.</P>
<P>§ XVI. On the last day of February the Duke of So∣merset
represented in the House of Lords, that the num∣ber
of peers being very much increased, especially since
the union of the two kingdoms, it seemed absolutely ne∣cessary
to take effectual measures for preventing the in∣conveniencies
that might attend the creation of a great
number of peers, to serve a present purpose: an expedient
which had been actually taken in the late reign. He, there∣fore,
moved that a bill should be brought in, to settle and
limit the peerage, in such a manner, that the number of
English peers should not be enlarged beyond six above the
present number, which, upon failure of male issue, might be
supplied by new creations: that, instead of the sixteen elec∣tive
peers from Scotland, twenty-five should be made here∣ditary
on the part of that kingdom; and that this num∣ber,
upon failure of heirs male, should be supplied from
the other members of the Scottish peerage. This bill was
intended as a restraint upon the Prince of Wales, who
happened to be at variance with the present ministry.
The motion was supported by the Duke of Argyle, now
lord-steward of the household, the Earls of Sunderland
and Carlisle. It was opposed by the Earl of Oxford, who
said, that although he expected nothing from the crown,
<PB N="353" REF="359"/>
he would never give his vote for lopping off so valuable a
branch of the prerogative, which enabled the King to re∣ward
merit and virtuous actions. The debate was ad∣journed
to the second day of March, when Earl Stanhope
delivered a message from the King, intimating, that as they
had under consideration the state of the British peerage,
he had so much at heart the settling it upon such a foun∣dation
as might secure the freedom and constitution of
parliaments in all future ages, that he was willing his pre∣rogative
should not stand in the way of so great and neces∣sary
a work. Another violent debate ensued between the
two factions. The question here, as in almost every other
dispute, was not, Whether the measure proposed was ad∣vantageous
to the nation? but, Whether the Tory or the
Whig interest should predominate in parliament? Earl
Cowper affirmed that the part of the bill relating to the
Scottish peerage was a manifest violation of the treaty of
union, as well as a flagrant piece of injustice, as it would
deprive persons of their right, without being heard, and
without any pretense or forfeiture on their part. He ob∣served
that the Scottish peers excluded from the number
of the twenty-five would be in a worse condition than
any other subjects in the kingdom; for they would be nei∣ther
electing nor elected, neither representing nor repre∣sented.
These objections were over-ruled;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals.</NOTE> several reso∣lutions
were taken agreeably to the motion;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Corbet.</NOTE> and the
judges were ordered to prepare and bring in the bill.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tindal.</NOTE>
This measure alarmed the generality of Scottish peers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. Reg.</NOTE> as
well as many English commoners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deb. in Par.</NOTE> who saw in the bill the
avenues of dignity and title shut up against them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the Admirals.</NOTE> and
they did not fail to exclaim against it, as an encroachment
upon the fundamental maxims of the constitution. Trea∣tises
were writ and published on both sides of the question;
and a national clamour began to arise, when Earl Stan∣hope
observed, in the House, that as the bill had raised
strange apprehensions, he thought it adviseable to postpone
the further consideration of it till a more proper oppor∣tunity.
It was accordingly dropped, and the parliament
<PB N="354" REF="360"/>
prorogued on thé eighteenth day of April, on which oc∣casion
his Majesty told both Houses, that the Spanish King
had acknowledged the Pretender.</P>
<P>§ XVII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1719.</NOTE> The King having appointed lords-justices to
rule the kingdom in his absence, embarked in May so
Holland, from whence he proceeded to Hanover, when
he concluded a peace with Ulrica, the new Queen of Swe∣den.
By this treaty Sweden yielded for ever to the royal
and electoral house of Brunswick the duchies of Bremen
and Verden, with all their dependencies: King Geroge
obliged himself to pay a million of rixdollars to the Queer
of Sweden; and to renew, as King of Great-Britain and
Elector of Hanover, the alliances formerly subsisting be∣tween
his predecessors and that kingdom. He likewise
mediated a peace between Sweden and his former allies,
the Danes, the Prussians, and the Poles. The Czar, how∣ever,
refused to give up his schemes of conquest. He sent
his fleet to the Scheuron or Batses of Sweden, where his
troops landing, to the number of fifteen thousand, com∣mitted
dreadful outrages; but Sir John Norris, who com∣manded
an English squadron in those seas, having orders
to support the negociations, and oppose any hostilities that
might be committed, the Czar, dreading the fate of the
Spanish navy, thought proper to recall his fleet. In the
Mediterranean, Admiral Byng acted with unwearied vi∣gour
in assisting the Imperialists to finish the conquest of
Sicily. The court of Vienna had agreed to send a strong
body of forces to finish the reduction of that island; and
the command in this expedition was bestowed upon the
Count de Merci, with whom Sir George Byng conferred
at Naples. This admiral supplied them with ammunition
and artillery from the Spanish prizes. He took the whole
re-enforcement under his convoy, and saw them safely
landed in the bay of Patti, to the number of three thou∣sand
five hundred horse, and ten thousand infantry. Count<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Merci thinking himself more than a match for the Spanish
forces commanded by the Marquis de Lede, attacked him
in a strong camp at Franca-Villa; and was repulsed with
<PB N="355" REF="361"/>
the loss of five thousand men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. II. 1719.</NOTE> himself being dangerously
wounded in the action. Here his army must have perished
for want of provision, had not they been supplied by the
English navy.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. Admiral Byng no sooner learned the bad suc∣cess
of the attack at Franca-Villa, than he embarked two
battalions from the garrison of Melazzo, and about a
thousand recruits, whom he sent under a convoy through
the Faro to Scheso-bay, in order to re-enforce the Imperial
army. He afterwards assisted at a council of war with the
German generals, who, in consequence of his advice, un∣dertook
the siege of Messina. Then he repaired to Na∣ples,
where he proposed to Count Gallas, the new viceroy,
that the troops destined for the conquest of Sardinia should
be first landed in Sicily, and co-operate towards the con∣quest
of that island. The proposal was immediately dis∣patched
to the court of Vienna. In the mean time, the
Admiral returned to Sicily, and assisted in the siege of
Messina. The town surrendered: the garrison retired into
the citadel; and the remains of the Spanish navy, which
had escaped at Passaro, were now destroyed in the Mole.
The Emperor approved of the scheme proposed by the
English admiral, to whom he wrote a very gracious letter,
intimating that he had dispatched orders to the Governor
of Milan, to detach the troops designed for Sardinia to
Vado, in order to be transported into Italy. The admiral
charged himself with the performance of this service.
Having furnished the Imperial army before Messina with
another supply of cannon, powder, and shot, upon his own
credit, he set sail for Vado, where he surmounted number∣less
difficulties, started by the jealousy of Count Bonneval,
who was unwilling to see his troops, destined for Sardinia,
now diverted to another expedition, in which he could
not enjoy the chief command. At length, Admiral Byng
saw the forces embarked, and convoyed them to Messina,
the citadel of which surrendered in a few days after their
arrival. By this time the Marquis de Lede had fortified a
<PB N="356" REF="362"/>
strong post at Castro-Giovanne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1719.</NOTE> in the centre of the island;
and cantoned his troops about Aderno, Palermo, and Ca∣tanea.
The Imperialists could not pretend to attack him
in this situation, nor could they remain in the neighbour∣hood
of Messina, on account of the sarcity of provisions.
They would, therefore, have been obliged to quit the island
during the winter, had not the admiral undertaken to
transport them by sea to Trapani, where they could extend
themselves in a plentiful country. He not only executed
this enterprise; but even supplied them with corn from
Tunis, as the harvests of Sicily had been gathered into the
Spanish magazines. It was the second day of March
before the last embarkation of the Imperial troops were
landed at Trapani.</P>
<P>§ XIX. The Marquis de Lede immediately retired with
his army to Alcamo, from whence he sent his mareschal
de camp to Count Merci and the English admiral, with
overtures for evacuating Sicily. The proposals were not
disagreeable to the Germans; but Sir George Byng de∣clared
that the Spaniards should not quit the island while
the war continued, as he foresaw that these troops would
be employed against France or England. He agreed,
however, with Count Merci, in proposing, that if the
Marquis would surrender Palermo, and retire into the
middle part of the island, they would consent to an ar∣mistice
for six weeks, until the sentiments of their different
courts should be known. The Marquis offered to surrender
Palermo, in consideration of a suspension of arms for three
months; but, while this negociation was depending, he
received advice from Madrid, that a general peace was
concluded. Nevertheless, he broke off the treaty in obe∣dience
to a secret order for that purpose. The King of
Spain hoped to obtain the restitution of St. Sebastian's,
Fontarabia, and other places taken in the course of the war,
in exchange for the evacuation of Sicily. Hostilities were
continued until the admiral received advice from the Earl of
Stair at Paris, that the Spanish ambassador at the Hague had
<PB N="357" REF="363"/>
signed the quadruple alliance. By the same courier pack∣ets
were delivered to the Count de Merci and the Marquis
de Lede, which last gave the admiral and Imperial gene∣ral
to understand that he looked upon the peace as a thing
concluded; and was ready to treat for a cessation of
hostilities. They insisted upon his delivering up Palermo:
on the other hand, he urged, that as their masters were in
treaty for settling the terms of evacuating Sicily and Sar∣dinia,
he did not think himself authorised to agree to a
cessation, except on condition that each party should
remain on the ground they occupied, and expect further
orders from their principals. After a fruitless interview
between the three chiefs at the Cassine de Rossignola, the
Imperial general resolved to undertake the siege of Palermo:
with this view he decamped from Alcamo on the eighteenth
day of April, and followed the Marquis de Lede, who
retreated before him, and took possession of the advan∣tageous
posts that commanded the passes into the plain of
Palermo; but Count Merci, with indefatigable diligence,
marched over the mountains, while the admiral coasted
along-shore, attending the motions of the army. The
Spanish general perceiving the Germans advancing into
the plain, retired under the cannon of Palermo, and
fortified his camp with strong entrenchments. On the
second day of May the Germans took one of the enemy's
redoubts by surprise, and the Marquis de Lede ordered
all his forces to be drawn out to retake this fortification:
both armies were on the point of engaging when a courier
arrived in a felucca, with a packet for the Marquis, con∣taining
full powers to treat and agree about the evacuation
of the island, and the transportation of the army to Spain.
He forthwith drew off his army; and sent a trumpet to
the general and admiral, with letters, informing them of
the orders he had received. Commissioners were appoint∣ed
on each side, the negociations begun, and the con∣ventions
signed in a very few days. The Germans were
put in possession of Palermo, and the Spanish army marched
<PB N="358" REF="364"/>
to Tauromini, from whence they were transported to Bar∣celona.</P>
<P>§ XX. The admiral continued in the Mediterranean
until he had seen the islands of Sicily and Sardinia evacu∣ated
by the Spaniards, and the mutual cessions executed
between the Emperor and the Duke of Savoy, in conse∣quence
of which, four battalions of Piedmontese troops
were transported from Palermo to Sardinia, and took
possession of Cagliari in the name of their master. In a
word, Admiral Byng bore such a considerable share in
this war of Sicily, that the fate of the island depended
wholly on his courage, vigilance, and conduct. When
he waited on his Majesty at Hanover, he met with a
very gracious reception. The King told him he had
found out the secret of obliging his enemies as well as his
friends; for the court of Spain had mentioned him in the
most honourable terms, with respect to his candid and
friendly deportment, in providing transports and other
necessaries for the embarkation of their troops, and in
protecting them from oppression. He was appointed
treasurer of the navy, and rear admiral of Great-Britain:
in a little time the King ennobled him, by the title of
Viscount Torrington: he was declared a privy-counsel∣lor;
and afterwards made knight of the Bath, at the revival
of that order. During these occurrences in the Mediter∣ranean,
the Duke of Berwick advanced with the French
army to the frontiers of Spain, where he took Fort-Passage
and destroyed six ships of war that were on the stocks:
then he reduced Fontarabia and St. Sebastian's, together
with Port Antonio in the bottom of the Bay of Bis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay.
In this last exploit the French were assisted by a detach∣ment
of English seamen, who burned two large ships un∣finished,
and a great quantity of naval stores. The King
of England, with a view to indemnify himself for the ex∣pense
of the war, projected the conquest of Corunna in
Biscay, and of Peru in South-America. Four thousand
men, commanded by Lord Cobham, were embarked at
the Isle of Wight, and sailed on the twenty-first day of
<PB N="359" REF="365"/>
September, under convoy of five ships of war, conducted
by Admiral Mighels. Instead of making an attempt upon
Corunna, they reduced Vigo with very little difficulty;
and Pont-a-Vedra submitted without resistance: here
they found some brass artillery, small arms, and military
stores, with which they returned to England. In the
mean time Captain Johnson, with two English ships of
war, destroyed the same number of Spanis ships in the
port of Ribadeo, to the eastward of Cape Ortegas; so that
the naval power of Spain was totally ruined. The ex∣pedition
to the West-Indies was prevented by the peace.
Spain being oppressed on all sides, and utterly exhausted,
Philip saw the necessity of a speedy pacification. He now
perceived the madness of Alberoni's ambitious projects.
That minister was personally disagreeable to the Emperor,
the King of England, and the Regent of France, who
had declared they would hearken to no proposals while he
should continue in office: the Spanish monarch, there∣fore,
divested him of his employment; and ordered him
to quit the kingdom in three weeks. The Marquis de
Beretti Landi, minister from the court of Madrid at the
Hague, delivered a plan of pacification to the States: but
it was rejected by the allies; and Philip was obliged at last
to accede to the quadruple alliance.</P>
<P>§ XXI. On the fourteenth day of November King
George returned to England, and on the twenty-third
opened the session of parliament with a speech, in which
he told them, that all Europe as well as Great-Britain,
was on the point of being delivered from the calamities of
war, by the influence of British arms and councils. He
exhorted the Commons to concert proper means for
lessening the debts of the nation; and concluded with a
panegyrick upon his own government. It must be owned
he had acted with equal vigour and deliberation in all the
troubles he had encountered since his accession to the throne.
The addresses of both Houses were as warm as he could
desire. They in particular extolled him for having inter∣posed
in behalf of the protestants of Hungary, Poland,
<PB N="360" REF="366"/>
and Germany, who had been oppressed by the practices
of the popish clergy, and presented to him memorials, con∣taining
a detail of their grievances. He and all the other
protestant powers warmly interceded in their favour; but
the grievances were not redressed. The peerage-bill was
now revived by the Duke of Buckingham; and, in spite
of all opposition, passed through the House of Lords. It
had been projected by Earl Stanhope, and cagerly sup∣ported
by the Earl of Sunderland; therefore, Mr. Robert
Walpole attacked it in the House of Commons with ex∣traordinary
vehemence. Here too it was opposed by a
considerable number of Whig members; and, after warm
debates, rejected by a large majority. The next object
that engrossed the attention of the parliament was a bill
for better securing the dependency of Ireland upon the
crown of Great-Britain. Maurice Annesley had appealed
to the House of Peers in England, from a decree of the
House of Peers in Ireland, which was reversed. The
British peers ordered the Barons of the Exchequer in Ire∣land
to put Mr. Annesley in possession of the lands he
had lost by the decree in that kingdom. The Baron<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
obeyed this order; and the Irish House of Peers passed a
vote against them, as having acted in derogation to the
King's prerogative in his high court of parliament in Ire∣land,
as also of the rights and privileges of that kingdom,
and of the parliament thereof: they, likewise, ordered them
to be taken into custody of the usher of the black-rod<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>:
they transmitted a long representation to the King, de∣monstrating
their right to the final judicature of causes;
and the Duke of Leeds, in the Upper House, urged
fifteen reasons to support the claim of the Irish peers.
Notwithstanding these arguments, the House of Lords in
England resolved that the Barons of the Exchequer in
Ireland had acted with courage, according to law, in sup∣port
of his Majesty's prerogative, and with sidelity to
the crown of Great-Britain. They addressed the King to
conser on them some marks of his royal favour, as a re∣compense
for the ill usage they had undergone. Finally,
<PB N="361" REF="367"/>
they prepared the bill, by which the Irish House of Lords
was deprived of all right to pass sentence, affirm, or reverse
any judgment or decree, given or made in any court with∣in
that kingdom. In the House of Commons it was op∣posed
by Mr. Pitt, Mr. Hungerford, Lords Molesworth
and Tyrconnel: but was carried by the majority, and
received the royal assent.</P>
<P>§ XXII. The King's having recommended to the Com∣mons
the consideration of proper means for lessening the
national debt was a prelude to the famous South-Sea act,
which became productive of so much mischief and infatu∣ation.
The scheme was projected by Sir John Blunt,
who had been bred a scrivener, and was possessed of all the
cunning, plausibility, and boldness requisite for such an
undertaking. He communicated his plan to Mr. Aislabie,
the chancellor of the Exchequer, as well as to one of the
secretaries of state. He answered all their objections;
and the project was adopted. They foresaw their own
private advantage in the execution of the design, which
was imparted in the name of the South-Sea company, of
which Blunt was a director, who influenced all their pro∣ceedings.
The pretence for the scheme was to discharge
the national debt, by reducing all the funds into one.
The Bank and South-Sea company outbid each other.
The South-Sea company altered their original plan, and
offered such high terms to government, that the proposals
of the Bank were rejected; and a bill was ordered to be
brought into the House of Commons, formed on the plan
presented by the South-Sea company. While this assair
was in agitation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals.</NOTE> the stock of that company rose from one
hundred and thirty to near four hundred,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Corbe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> in consequence
of the conduct of the Commons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. Reg.</NOTE> who had rejected a mo∣tion
for a clause in the bill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tindal.</NOTE> to fix what share in the capi∣tal
stock of the company should be vested in those pro∣prietors
of the annuities who might voluntarily subscribe;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the Admirals.</NOTE>
or how many years purchase in money they should receive
in subscribing, at the choice of the proprietors.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1720.</NOTE> In the
House of Lords, the bill was opposed by Lord North and
<PB N="362" REF="368"/>
Grey, Earl Cowper, the Dukes of Wharton, Bucking∣ham,
and other peers. They affirmed it was calculated
for enriching a few and impoverishing a great number:
that it countenanced the fraudulent and pernicious prac∣tice
of stock-jobbing, which diverted the genius of the
people from trade and industry: that it would give fo∣reigners
the opportunity to double and treble the vast
sums they had in the publick funds; and they would be
tempted to release and withdraw their capital and immense
gains to other countries; so that Great-Britain would be
drained of its gold and silver; that the artificial and pro∣digious
rise of the South-Sea stock was a dangerous
bait, which might decoy many unwary people <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
ruin, alluring them by a false prospect of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
with the fruits of their industry, to purchase <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
riches: that the addition of above thirty millions <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
would give such power to the South-Sea company, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
might endanger the liberties of the nation; for by their
extensive interest they would be able to influence most, if
not all the elections of the members; and consequently
over-rule the resolutions of the House of Commons. Earl
Cowper urged that in all publick bargains the individuals
in the administration ought to take care, that they shall
be more advantageous to the state than to private persons;
but that a contrary method had been followed in the con∣tract
made with the South-Sea company; for, should the
stocks be kept at the advanced price to which they had
been raised by the oblique arts of stock-jobbing, either
that company or its principal members would gain above
thirty millions, of which no more than one fourth part
would be given towards the discharge of the national debts.
He apprehended that the re-purchase of annuities would
meet with insuperable difficulties; and, in such case, none
but a few persons who were in the secret, who had bought
stocks at a low rate, and afterwards sold them at a high
price would in the end be gainers by the project. The
Earl of Sunderland answered their objections. He de∣clared
that those who countenanced the scheme of the
<PB N="363" REF="369"/>
South-Sea company, had nothing in view but the advan∣tage
of the nation. He owned that the managers for that
company had undoubtedly a prospect of private gain,
either to themselves or to their corporation; but, he said,
when the scheme was accepted, neither the one nor the
other could foresee that the stocks would have risen to
such a height: that if they had continued as they were,
the public would have had the far greater share of the ad∣vantage
accruing from the scheme; and should they be
kept up to the present high price, it was but reasonable
that the South-Sea company should enjoy the profits pro∣cured
to it by the wise management and industry of the
directors, which would enable it to make large dividends,
and thereby accomplish the purpose of the scheme. The
bill passed without amendment or division; and, on the
seventh day of April, received the royal assent. By this
act the South-Sea company was authorised to take in, by
purchase or subscription, the irredeemable debts of the
nation, stated at sixteen millions five hundred forty-six
thousand four hundred eighty-two pounds, seven shillings,
one penny farthing, at such times as they should find con∣venient
before the first day of March of the ensuing year,
and without any compulsion on any of the proprietors, at
such rates and prices as should be agreed upon between
the company and the respective proprietors. They were
likewise authorised to take in all the redeemable debts,
amounting to the same sum as that of the irredeemables,
either by purchase, by taking subscriptions, or by paying
off the creditors. For the liberty of taking in the na∣tional
debts, and increasing their capital stock accordingly,
the company consented that their present, and to be in∣creased
annuity, should be continued at five per cent. till
Midsummer, in the year one thousand seven hundred and
twenty-seven; from thence to be reduced to four per cent.
and be redeemable by parliament. In consideration of this
and other advantages expressed in the act, the company
declared themselves willing to make such payments into
the receipt of the Exchequer as were specified for the
<PB N="364" REF="370"/>
use of the publick, to be applied to the discharge of the
publick debts incurred before Christmas, in the year one
thousand seven hundred and sixteen. The sums they were
obliged to pay for the liberty of taking in the redeemable
debts, four years and a half's purchase for all the long
and short annuities that should be subscribed and one
year's purchase for such long annuities as should not be
subscribed, amounted on the execution of the act to about
seven millions. For enabling the company to raise this
sum, they were empowered to make calls for money from
their members; to open books of subscription; to grant
annuities redeemable by the company; to borrow money
upon any contract or bill under their common seal, or on
the credit of their capital stock; to convert the money de∣manded
of their members into additional stock, without,
however, making any addition to the company's annuities,
payable out of the publick duties. It was enacted, That
out of the first monies arising from the sums paid by the
company into the Exchequer, such publick debts, carrying
interest at five per cent. incurred before the twenty-fifth
day of December, in the year one thousand seven hundred
and sixteen, founded upon any former act of parliament,
as were now redeemable, or might be redeemed before the
twenty-fifth day of December, in the year one thousand
seven hundred and twenty-two, should be discharged in
the first place: that then all the remainder should be ap∣plied
towards paying off so much of the capital stock of the
the company as should then carry an interest at five per
cent. It was likewise provided, that after Midsummer, in
the year one thousand seven hundred and twenty-seven, the
company should not be paid off in any sums being less than
one million at a time.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. The heads of the Royal-Assurance and Lon∣don-Assurance
companies, understanding that the civil∣list
was considerably in arrears, offered to the ministry
six hundred thousand pounds towards the discharge
of that debt, on condition of their obtaining the
King's charter, with a parliamentary sanction for the
<PB N="365" REF="371"/>
establishment of their respective companies. The proposal
was embraced; and the King communicated it in a mes∣sage
to the House of Commons, desiring their concurrence.
A bill was immediately passed, enabling his Majesty to
grant letters of incorporation to the two companies. It
soon obtained the royal assent; and, on the eleventh day
of June, an end was put to the session. This was the age
of interested projects, inspired by a venal spirit of adven∣ture,
the natural consequence of that avarice, fraud, and
profligacy, which the monied corporations had introduced.
This of all others is the most unfavourable aera for an histo∣rian.
A reader of sentiment and imagination cannot be
entertained or interested by a dry detail of such transactions
as admit of no warmth, no colouring, no embellishment—
a detail which serves only to exhibit an inanimate picture
of tasteless vice and mean degeneracy.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. By this time an alliance offensive and de∣fensive
was concluded at Stockholm between King
George and the Queen of Sweden, by which his Majesty
engaged to send a fleet into the Baltick, to act against the
Czar of Muscovy, in case that monarch should reject rea∣sonable
proposals of peace. Peter loudly complained of the
insolent interposition of King George, alledging that he had
failed in his engagements, both as Elector of Hanover and
King of Great-Britain. His resident at London presented
a long memorial on this subject, which was answered by
the British and Hanoverian ministry. These recrimina∣tions
served only to inflame the difference. The Czar
continued to prosecute the war; and at length concluded
a peace without a mediator. At the instances, however,
of King George, and the Regent of France, a treaty of
peace was signed between the Queen of Sweden and the
King of Prussia, to whom that princess ceded the city of
Stetin, the district between the rivers Oder and Pehnne,
with the isles of Wollin and Usedom. On the other hand,
he engaged to join the King of Great-Britain in his en∣deavours
to effect a peace between Sweden and Denmark,
on condition that the Danish King should restore to Queen
<PB N="366" REF="372"/>
Ulrica that part of Pomerania which he had seised: he
likewise promised to pay to that queen two millions of rix∣dollars,
in consideration of the cessions she had made. The
treaty between Sweden and Denmark was signed at Frede∣rickstadt
in the month of June, through the mediation of
the King of Great-Britain, who became guarantee for the
Dane's keeping possession of Sleswick. He consented, how∣ever,
to restore the Upper Pomerania, the isle of Rugen,
the city of Wismar, and whatever he had taken from Swe∣den
during the war, in consideration of Sweden's renouncing
the exemption from toll in the Sound, and the two belts;
and paying to Denmark six hundred thousand rixdol∣lars.</P>
<P>§ XXV. Sir John Norris had again sailed to the Baltick
with a strong squadron, to give weight to the King's me∣diation.
When he arrived at Copenhagen he wrote a
letter to Prince Dolgorouki, the Czar's ambassador at the
court of Denmark, signifying that he and the King's envoy
at Stockholm were vested with full powers to act jointly
or separately in quality of plenipotentiaries, in order to
effect a peace between Sweden and Muscovy, in the way
of mediation. The Prince answered that the Czar had
nothing more at heart than peace and tranquillity; and,
in case his Britannick Majesty had any proposals to make
to that prince, he hoped the Admiral would excuse him
from receiving them, as they might be delivered in a
much more compendious way. The English fleet im∣mediately
joined that of Sweden as auxiliaries; but they
had no opportunity of acting against the Russian squadron,
which secured itself in Revel. Ulrica, Queen of Sweden,
and sister to Charles XII. had married the Prince of Hesse,
and was extremely desirous that he should be joined with
her in the administration of the regal power. She wrote
a separate letter to each of the four states, desiring they
would confer on him the sovereignty; and, after some op∣position
from the nobles, he was actually elected King of
Sweden. He sent one of his general officers to notify his
elevation to the Czar, who congratulated him upon his
<PB N="367" REF="373"/>
accession to the throne: this was the beginning of a nego∣ciation
which ended in peace, and established the tranquil∣lity
of the North. In the midst of these transactions King
George set out from England for his Hanoverian dominions;
but, before he departed from Great-Britain he was recon∣ciled
to the Prince of Wales, through the endeavours of
the Duke of Devonshire and Mr. Walpole, who, with Earl
Cowper, Lord Townshend, Mr. Methuen, and Mr. Pul∣teney,
were received into favour, and re-united with the
ministry. The Earls of Dorset and Bridgewater were pro∣moted
to the title of dukes: Lord Viscount Castleton was
made an earl; Hugh Boscawen was created a baron, and

Lymington.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. While the King was involved at Hanover in
a labyrinth of negociations, the South-Sea scheme pro∣duced
a kind of national delirium in his English domini∣ons.
Blunt, the projector, had taken the hint of his plan
from the famous Mississippi scheme formed by Law, which
in the preceding year had raised such a ferment in France,
and entailed ruin upon many thousand families of that
kingdom. In the scheme of Law, there was something
substantial. An exclusive trade to Louisiana promised
some advantage; though the design was defeated by the
frantick eagerness of the people. Law himself became
the dupe of the Regent, who transferred the burthen of
fifteen hundred millions of the King's debts to the shoul∣ders
of the subjects; while the projector was sacrificed as
the scape-goat of political iniquity. The South-Sea
scheme promised no commercial advantage of any con∣sequence.
It was buoyed up by nothing but the folly and
rapaciousness of individuals, which became so blind and
extravagant, that Blunt, with moderate talents, was able
to impose upon the whole nation, and make tools of the
other directors, to serve his own purposes, and those of a
few associates. When this projector found that the
South-Sea stock did not rise according to his expectation
upon the bills being passed, he circulated a report, that
<PB N="368" REF="374"/>
Gibraltar and Port-Mahon would be exchanged for some
places in Peru; by which means the English trade to the
South-Sea would be protected and enlarged. This ru∣mour,
diffused by his emissaries, acted like a contagion.
In five days the directors opened their books for a subscrip∣tion
of one million, at the rate of three hundred pounds
for every hundred pounds capital. Persons of all ranks
crouded to the house in such a manner, that the first sub∣scription
exceeded two millions of original stock. In a
few days this stock advanced to three hundred and forty
pounds; and the subscriptions were sold for double the
price of the first payment. Without entering into a detail
of the proceedings, or explaining the scandalous arts that
were practised to enhance the value of the stock, and
decoy the unwary, we shall only observe, that by the
promise of prodigious dividends, and other infamous arts,
the stock was raised to one thousand; and the whole
nation infected with the spirit of stock-jobbing to an
astonishing degree. All distinctions of party, religion,
sex, character, and circumstance, were swallowed up in this
universal concern, or in some such pecuniary project.
Exchange alley was filled with a strange concourse of
statesmen and clergymen, churchmen and dissenters,
Whigs and Tories, physicians, lawyers, tradesmen, and
even with multitudes of females. All other professions
and employments were utterly neglected; and the people's
attention wholly engrossed by this and other chimerical
schemes, which were known by the denomination of
bubbles. New companies started up every day, under
the countenance of the prime nobility. The Prince of
Wales was constituted governor of the Welch copper com∣pany:
the Duke of Chandos appeared at the head of the
York-buildings company: the Duke of Bridgewater form∣ed
a third, for building houses in London and Westmin∣ster.
About a hundred such schemes were projected and
put in execution, to the ruin of many thousands. The
sums proposed to be raised by these expedients amounted
to three hundred millions sterling, which exceeded the
<PB N="369" REF="375"/>
value of all the lands in England. The nation was so in∣toxicated
with the spirit of adventure, that people became
a prey to the grossest delusion. An obscure projector, pre∣tending
to have formed a very advantageous scheme, which,
however, he did not explain, published proposals for a sub∣scription,
in which he promised, that in one month <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> par∣ticulars
of his project should be disclosed. In the mean
time, he declared that every person paying two guineas
should be entitled to a subscription for one hundred pounds,
which would produce that sum yearly. In one forenoon
this adventurer received a thousand of these subscriptions;
and in the evening set out for another kingdom. The King,
before his departure, had issued a proclamation against these
unlawful projects: the lords-justices afterwards dismissed
all the petitions that had been presented for charters and
patents; and the Prince of Wales renounced the company
of which he had been elected governor. The South-Sea
scheme raised such a flood of eager avidity and extravagant
hope, that the majority of the directors were swept along
with it, even contrary to their own sense and inclina∣tion;
but, Blunt and his accomplices still directed the
stream.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. The infatuation prevailed till the eighth
day of September, when the stock began to fall. Then
did some of the adventurers awake from their delirium.
The number of the sellers daily increased. On the
twenty-ninth day of the month, the stock had sunk to one
hundred and fifty: several eminent goldsmiths and bankers,
who had lent great sums upon it, were obliged to stop
payment, and abscond. The ebb of this portentous tide
was so violent, that it bore down every thing in its way;
and an infinite number of families was overwhelmed with
ruin. Publick credit sustained a terrible shock: the nation
was thrown into a dangerous serment; and nothing was
heard but the ravings of grief, disappointment, and despair.
Some principal members of the ministry were deeply con∣cerned
in these sraudulent transactions: when they saw the
price of stock sinking daily, they employed all their
<PB N="370" REF="376"/>
influence with the Bank to support the credit of the South-Sea
company. That corporation agreed, though with re∣luctance,
to subscribe into the stock of the South-Sea com∣pany,
valued at four hundred per cent. three millions five
hundred thousand pounds, which the company was to repay
to the Bank on Lady-day and Michaelmas of the ensuing year.
This transaction was managed by Mr. Robert Walpole,
who, with his own hand, wrote the minute of agreement,
afterwards known by the name of the Bank contract.
Books were opened at the Bank, to take in a subscription for
the support of public credit; and considerable sums of money
were brought in. By this expedient the stock was raised
at first, and those who contrived it seised the opportunity
to realize. But the bankruptcy of goldsmiths and the
sword-blade company, from the fall of South-Sea stock,
occasioned such a run upon the Bank, that the money was
paid away faster than it could be received from the sub∣scription.
Then the South-Sea stock sunk again; and the
directors of the Bank, finding themselves in danger of be∣ing
involved in that company's ruin, renounced the agree∣ment,
which, indeed, they were under no obligation to
perform, for it was drawn up in such a manner, as to be
no more than the rough draft of a subsequent agreement,
without due form, penalty, or clause of obligation. All
expedients having failed, and the clamours of the people
daily increasing, expresses were dispatched to Hanover, re∣presenting
the state of the nation, and pressing the King
to return. He accordingly shortened his intended stay in
Germany, and arrived in England on the eleventh day of
November.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. The parliament being assembled on the
eighth day of December, his Majesty expressed his con∣cern
for the unhappy turn of affairs, which had so deeply
affected the publick credit at home: he earnestly desired
the Commons to consider of the most effectual and speedy
methods to restore the national credit, and six it upon a
lasting establishment. The Lower House was too much
interested in the calamity, to postpone the consideration of
<PB N="371" REF="377"/>
that subject. The members seemed to lay aside all party
distinctions, and vie with each other in promoting an en∣quiry,
by which justice might be done to the injured
nation. They ordered the directors to produce an account
of all their proceedings. Sir Joseph Jekyll moved, that a
select committe might be appointed, to examine the par∣ticulars
of this transaction. Mr. Walpole, now pay∣master
of the forces, observed, that such a method would
protract the enquiry, while the public credit lay in a bleed∣ing
condition. He told the House he had formed a
scheme for restoring public credit; but, before he would
communicate this plan, desired to know whether the sub∣scriptions
of publick debts and incumbrances, money-subscriptions,
and other contracts made with the South-Sea
company, should remain in the present state. After a
warm debate, the question was carried in the affirmative,
with this addition, “Unless altered for the ease and re∣lief
of the proprietors, by a general court of the South-Sea
company, or set aside in due course of law.” Next
day Walpole produced his scheme to engraft nine millions
of South-Sea stock into the Bank of England, and the
like sum into the East-India company, on certain con∣ditions.
The House voted, that proposals should be re∣ceived
from the Bank, and those two companies, on this
subject. These being delivered, the Commons resolved,
that an engrossment of nine millions of the capital stock
of the South-Sea company, into the capital stock of the
Bank and East-India company, as proposed by these com∣panies,
would contribute very much to the restoring pub∣lic
credit. A bill upon this resolution was brought in,
passed through both Houses, and received the royal-assent.
Another bill was enacted into a law, for restraining the
sub-governor, deputy-governor, directors, treasurer, un∣der-treasurer,
cashier, secretary, and accountants, of the
South-Sea company, from quitting the kingdom, till
the end of the next session of parliament; and for dis∣covering
their estates and effects, so as to prevent them
from being transported or alienated. A committee of
<PB N="372" REF="378"/>
secresy was chosen by ballot, to examine all the books, pa∣pers,
and proceedings, relating to the execution of the South-Sea
act.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. The Lords were not less eager than the
Commons to prosecute this enquiry, though divers
members in both Houses were deeply involved in the guilt
and infamy of the transaction. Earl Stanhope said the
estates of the criminals, whether directors or not directors,
ought to be confiscated, to repair the publick losses. He
was seconded by Lord Carteret, and even by the Earl of
Sunderland. The Duke of Wharton declared he would
give up the best friend he had, should he be sound guilty.
He observed, that the nation had been plundered in a most
flagrant and notorious manner; therefore, they ought to
find out and punish the offenders severely, without respect
of persons. The sub and deputy governors, the directors
and officers of the South-Sea company, were examined at
the bar of the House. Then a bill was brought in, dis∣abling
them to enjoy any office in that company, or in the
East-India company, or in the Bank of England. Three
brokers were likewise examined, and made great discove∣ries.
Knight, the treasurer of the South-Sea company,
who had been entrusted with the secrets of the whole
affair, thought proper to withdraw himself from the king∣dom.
A proclamation was issued to apprehend him; and
another for preventing any of the directors from escaping
out of the kingdom. At this period, the secret committee
informed the House of Commons, that they had already
discovered a train of the deepest villainy and fraud that hell
ever contrived to ruin a nation, which in due time they
would lay before the House: in the mean while, they
thought it highly necessary to secure the persons of some
of the directors and principal officers of the South-Sea
company, as well as to seise their papers. An order was
made to secure the books and papers of Knight, Surman,
and Turner. The persons of Sir George Caswel, Sir
John Blunt, Sir John Lambert, Sir John Fellows, and
Mr. Grigsby, were taken into custody. Sir Theodore
<PB N="373" REF="379"/>
Jansen, Mr. Sawbridge, Sir Robert Chaplain, and Mr.
Eyles, were expelled the House, and apprehended. Mr.
Aislabie resigned his employments of chancellor of the Ex∣chequer
and lord of the Treasury; and orders were given
to remove all directors of the South-Sea company from the
places they possessed under the government.</P>
<P>§ XXX. The Lords, in the course of their examination,
discovered that large portions of South-Sea stock had
been given to several persons in the administration and
House of Commons, for promoting the passage of the
South-Sea act. The House immediately resolved, that
this practice was a notorious and most dangerous species
of corruption: that the directors of the South-Sea com∣pany
having ordered great quantities of their stock to be
bought for the service of the company, when it was at a
very high price, and on pretence of keeping up the price
of stock; and at the same time several of the directors,
and other officers belonging to the company, having, in a
clandestine manner, sold their own stock to the company,
such directors and officers were guilty of a notorious fraud
and breach of trust, and their so doing was one great cause
of the unhappy turn of affairs, that had so much affected
public credit. Many other resolutions were taken against
that infamous confederacy, in which, however, the inno∣cent
were confounded with the guilty. Sir John Blunt
refusing to answer certain interrogations, a violent debate
arose about the manner in which he should be treated.
The Duke of Wharton observed, that the government of
the best princes was sometimes rendered intolerable to their
subjects by bad ministers; he mentioned the example of
Sejanus, who had made a division in the Imperial family,
and rendered the reign of Claudius hateful to the Romans.
Earl Stanhope conceiving this reflection was aimed at him,
was seised with a transport of anger. He undertook to
vindicate the ministry; and spoke with such vehemence
as produced a violent head-ach, which obliged him to re∣tire.
He underwent proper evacuations, and seemed to
recover: but next day, in the evening, became lethargick,
<PB N="374" REF="380"/>
and being seised with a suffocation, instantly expired. The
King deeply regretted the death of this favourite minister,
which was the more unfortunate, as it happened at such a
critical conjucture; and he appointed Lord Townshend to
fill his place of secretary. Earl Stanhope was survived but a
few days by the other secretary, Mr. Craggs, who died of
the small-pox on the sixteenth day of February. Knight,
the cashier of the South-Sea company, being seised at
Tirlemont, by the vigilance of Mr. Gandot, secretary to
Mr. Leathes, the British resident at Brussels, was confined
in the citadel of Antwerp. Application was made to the
court of Vienna, that he should be delivered up to such
persons as might be appointed to receive him: but he had
found means to interest the States of Brabant in his behalf.
They insisted upon their privilege granted by charter, that
no person apprehended for any crime in Brabant should be
tried in any other country. The House of Commons ex∣pressed
their indignation at this frivolous pretence: in∣stances
were renewed to the Emperor; and in the mean
time Knight escaped from the citadel of Antwerp.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. The committee of secresy found, that, before
any subscription could be made, a sictitious stock of five
hundred and seventy-four thousand pounds had been dis∣posed
of by the directors, to facilitate the passing the
bill. Great part of this was distributed among the Earl
of Sunderland, Mr. Craggs senior, the Duchess of Kendal,
the Countess of Platen and her two nieces, Mr. Secretary
Craggs, and Mr. Aislabie, chancellor of the Exchequer.
In consequence of the committee's report, the House came
to several severe though just resolutions against the di∣rectors
and officers of the South-Sea company; and a bill
was prepared for the relief of the unhappy sufferers. Mr.
Stanhope, one of the secretaries of the Treasury, charged
in the report with having large quantities of stock and
subscriptions, desired that he might have an opportunity
to clear himself. His request was granted; and the affair
being discussed, he was cleared by a majority of three
<PB N="375" REF="381"/>
voices. Fifty thousand pounds in stock had been taken
by Knight for the use of the Earl of Sunderland. Great
part of the House entered eagerly into this enquiry; and
a violent dispute ensued. The whole strength of the
ministry was mustered in his defence. The majority de∣clared
him innocent: the nation in general was of another
opinion. He resigned his place of first commissioner in
the Treasury, which was bestowed upon Mr. Robert Wal∣pole;
but he still retained the confidence of his master.
With respect to Mr. Aislabie, the evidence appeared so
strong against him, that the Commons resolved, he had
promoted the destructive execution of the South-Sea
scheme, with a view to his own exorbitant profit, and com∣bined
with the directors in their pernicious practices, to
the ruin of publick credit. He was expelled the House,
and committed to the Tower. Mr. Craggs senior died of
the lethargy, before he underwent the censure of the House.
Nevertheless, they resolved that he was a notorious accom∣plice
with Robert Knight, and some of the directors, in
carrying on their scandalous practices; and, therefore, that
all the estate of which he was possessed, from the first day
of December, in the preceding year, should be applied to∣wards
the relief of the unhappy sufferers in the South-Sea
company. The directors, in obedience to the order of
the House, delivered inventories of their estates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oldmi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on.</NOTE> which
were confiscated by act of parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals.</NOTE> towards making

<P>§ XXXII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1721.</NOTE> The delinqu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nts being thus punished by the
forfeiture of their fortunes, the House converted their at∣tention
to means for repairing the mischiefs which the
scheme had produced. This was a very difficult task, on
account of the contending interests of those engaged in the
South-Sea company, which rendered it impossible to relieve
some but at the expense of others. Several wholesome
resolutions were taken, and presented with an address to
the King, explaining the motives of their proceedings.
<PB N="376" REF="382"/>
On the twenty-ninth day of July,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1721.</NOTE> the parliament was
prorogued for two days only. Then his Majesty going
to the House of Peers, declared that he had called them
together again so suddenly, that they might resume the
consideration of the state of publick credit. The Com∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s
immediately prepared a bill upon the resolutions
they had taken. The whole capital stock, at the end of
the year one thousand seven hundred and twenty, amount∣ed
to about thirty-seven millions eight hundred thousand
pounds. The stock allotted to all the proprietors did not
exceed twenty-four millions five hundred thousand pounds:
the remaining capital stock belonged to the company in
their corporate capacity. It was the profit arising from
the execution of the South-Sea scheme; and out of this
the bill enacted, that seven millions should be paid to the
publick. The present act likewise directed several addi∣tions
to be made to the stock of the proprietors, out of
that possessed by the company in their own right: it made
a particular distribution of stock, amounting to two mil∣lions
two hundred thousand pounds; and, upon remitting
five millions of the seven to be paid to the publick, an∣nihilated
two millions of their capital. It was enacted,
that after these distributions, the remaining capital stock
should be divided among all the proprietors. This divi∣dend
amounted to thirty-three pounds six shillings and
eight pence per cent. and deprived the company of eight
millions nine hundred thousand pounds. They had lent
about eleven millions on stock unredeemed; of which the
parliament discharged all the debtors, upon their paying
ten per cent. Upon this article the company's loss ex∣ceeded
six millions nine hundred thousand pounds; for
many debtors refused to make any payment. The pro∣prietors
of the stock loudly complained of their being de∣prived
of two millions; and the parliament, in the sequel,
revived that sum which had been annihilated. While this
affair was in agitation petitions from counties, cities, and
boroughs, in all parts of the kingdom, were presented to
the House, crying for justice against the villainy of the
<PB N="377" REF="383"/>
directors.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. II. 1721.</NOTE> Pamphlets and papers were daily published on
the same subject; so that the whole nation was exasperated
to the highest pitch of resentment. Nevertheless, by the
wise and vigorous resolutions of the parliament, the South-Sea
company was soon in a condition to fulfil their engage∣ments
with the publick: the ferment of the people sub∣sided;
and the credit of the nation was restored.</P>

<P>§. I. DURING the infatuation produced by this in∣famous
scheme, luxury, vice, and profligacy,
increased to a shocking degree of extravagance. The ad∣venturers,
intoxicated by their imaginary wealth, pam∣pered
themselves with the rarest dainties, and the most
expensive wines that could be imported: they purchased
the most sumptuous furniture, equipage, and apparel,
though without taste or discernment: they indulged their
criminal passions to the most scandalous excess: their
discourse was the language of pride, insolence, and the
most ridiculous ostentation: they affected to scoff at reli∣gion
and morality; and even to set heaven at defiance.
The Earl of Nottingham complained in the House of
Lords of the growth of atheism, profaneness, and im∣morality;
and a bill was brought in for suppressing blas∣phemy
and profaneness. It contained several articles
seemingly calculated to restrain the liberty granted to non∣conformists
by the laws of the last session; for that reason
it met with violent opposition. It was supported by the
Archbishop of Canterbury, the Earl of Nottingham,
Lords Bathurst and Trevor, the Bishops of London, Win∣chester,
and Lichfield and Coventry. One of these said he
verily believed the present calamity occasioned by the
South-Sea project was a judgment of God on the blas∣phemy
and profaneness of the nation. Lord Onslow re∣plied,
“That noble peer must then be a great sinner, for
he has lost considerably by the South-sea scheme.” The
Duke of Wharton, who had rendered himself famous by
his wit and pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>igacy, said he was not insensible of the
common opinion of the town concerning himself, and
gladly seised this opportunity of vindicating his character,
by declaring he was far from being a patron of blasphemy,
or an enemy to religion. On the other hand, he could
not but oppose the bill, because he conceived it to be
<PB N="380" REF="386"/>
repugnant to the holy scriptures. Then pulling an old fa∣mily
bible from his pocket, he quoted several passages
from the epistles of St. Peter and St. Paul; concluding
with a desire that the bill might be thrown out. The
Earl of Peterborough declared, that though he was for a
parliamentary king, yet he did not desire to have a parlia∣mentary
god, or a parliamentary religion; and, should
the House declare for one of this kind, he would go to
Rome, and endeavour to be chosen a cardinal; for he had
rather sit in the conclave than with their lordships upon
those terms. After a vehement debate, the bill was post∣poned
to a long day, by a considerable majority.</P>
<P>§ II. The season was far advanced before the supplies
were granted; and at length they were not voted with th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
chearfulness and good humour which the majority <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
therto manifested on such occasions. On the sixteenth
day of June, the King sent a message to the House of
Commons, importing, that he had agreed to pay a subsidy
to the crown of Sweden, and he hoped they would enable
him to make good his engagements. The leaders of the
opposition took fire at this intimation. They desired to
know whether this subsidy, amounting to seventy-two
thousand pounds, was to be paid to Sweden over and above
the expense of maintaining a strong squadron in the Bal∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick?
Lord Molesworth observed, that, by our late con∣duct,
we were become the allies of the whole world, and
the bubbles of all our allies; for we were obliged to pay
them well for their assistance. He a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>irmed that the trea∣ties
which had been made with Sweden, at different times,
were inconsistent and contradictory: that our late engage∣ments
with that crown were contrary to the treaties sub∣sisting
with Denmark, and directly opposite to the mea∣sures
formerly concerted with the Czar of Muscovy. He
said, that, in order to engage the Czar to yield what he had
gained in the course of the war, the King of Prussia ought
to give up S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etin, and the Elector of Hanover restore
Bremen and Verden: that, after all, England had no bu∣siness
to intermeddle with the affairs of the empire: that
<PB N="381" REF="387"/>
we reaped little or no advantage by our trade to the Baltick,
but that of procuring naval stores: he owned that hemp
was a very necessary commodity, particularly at this junc∣ture;
but he insisted, that if due encouragement were
given to some of our plantations in America, we might
be supplied from thence at a much cheaper rate than
from Sweden and Norway. Notwithstanding these argu∣ments,
the Swedish supply was granted; and, in about
three weeks, their complaisance was put to another proof.
They were given to understand, by a second message, that
the debts of the civil-list amounted to five hundred and
fifty thousand pounds; and his Majesty hoped they would
empower him to raise that sum upon the revenue, as he
proposed it should be replaced to the civil-list, and re-em∣bursed
by a deduction from the salaries and wages of all
officers, as well as from the pensions and other payments
from the crown: A bill was prepared for this purpose,
though not without warm opposition; and, at the same
time, an act passed for a general pardon. On the tenth
day of August, the King closed the session with a speech,
in which he expressed his concern for the sufferings of
the innocent, and a just indignation against the guilty,
with respect to the South-Sea scheme. These profes∣sions
were judged necessary to clear his own character,
which had incurred the suspicion of some people, who
whispered that he was not altogether free from connexions
with the projectors of that design; that the Emperor had,
at his desire, refused to deliver up Knight; and that he
favoured the directors and their accomplices.</P>
<P>§ III. Lords Townsh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd and Carteret were now ap∣pointed
secretaries of state; and the Earl of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ay was
vested with the office of lord privy-seal of Scotland. In
June the treaty of peace between Great-Britain and
Spain was signed at Madrid. The contracting<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> parties
engaged to restore mutually all the effects seised and con∣fiscated
on both sides. In particular, the King of England
promised to restore all the ships of the Spanish fleet which
had been taken in the Mediterranean, or the value of
<PB N="382" REF="388"/>
them, if they were sold. He likewise promised, in a
secret article, that he would no longer interfere in the
affairs of Italy; and the King of Spain made an absolute
cession of Gibraltar and Port-Mahon. At the same time,
a defensive alliance was concluded between Great-Britain,
France, and Spain. All remaining difficulties were re∣ferred
to a congress at Cambray, where they hoped to
consolidate a general peace, by determining all differences
between the Emperor and his Catholick Majesty. In the
mean time, the powers of Great-Britain, France, and Spain,
engaged, by virtue of the present treaty, to grant to the
Duke of Parma a particular protection for the preservation
of his territories and rights, and for the support of his
dignity. It was also stipulated, that the States-General
should be invited to accede to this alliance. The congress
at Cambray was opened: but the demands on both sides
were so high, that it proved ineffectual. In the mean
time, the peace between Russia and Sweden was con∣cluded,
on condition that the Czar should retain Livonia,
Ingria, Estonia, part of Carelia, and of the territory of
Wyburg, Riga, Revel, and Narva, in consideration of his
restoring part of Finland, and paying two millions of rix-dollars
to the King of Sweden. The personal animosity
subsisting between King George and the Czar seemed to
increase. Bastagif, the Russian resident at London, having
presented a memorial that contained some unguarded ex∣pressions,
was ordered to quit the kingdom in a fortnight.
The Czar published a declaration at Petersburgh, com∣plaining
of this outrage, which, he said, ought naturally
to have engaged him to use reprisals; but, as he perceived
it was done without any regard to the concerns of Eng∣land,
and only in favour of the Hanoverian interest, he
was unwilling that the English nation should suffer for a
piece of injustice in which they had no share. He, there∣fore,
granted to them all manner of security, and free
liberty to trade in all his dominions. To finish this strange
tissue of negociations, King George concluded a treaty
<PB N="383" REF="389"/>
with the Moors of Africk, against which the Spaniards
loudly exclaimed.</P>
<P>§ IV. In the course of this year, Pope Clement XI.
died; and the Princess of Wales was delivered of a prince,
baptised by the name of William-Augustus, the late
Duke of Cumberland. A dreadful plague raging at Mar∣seilles,
a proclamation was published, forbidding any
person to come into England, from any part of France be∣tween
the bay of Biscay and Dunkirk, without certificates
of health. Other precautions were taken to guard against
contagion. An act of parliament had passed in the pre∣ceding
session, for the prevention of infection, by building
pest-houses, to which all infected persons, and all persons
of an infected family, should be conveyed; and, by draw∣ing
trenches and lines round any city, town, or place in∣fected.
The King, in his speech at opening the session
of parliament, on the nineteenth day of October, intimated
the pacification of the North, by the conclusion of the
treaty between Muscovy and Sweden. He desired the
House of Commons to consider of means for easing the
duties upon the imported commodities used in the manu∣factures
of the kingdom. He observed, that the nation
might be supplied with naval stores from our own colo∣nies
in North America; and that their being employed in
this useful and advantageous branch of commerce would
divert them from setting up manufactures which directly
interfered with those of Great-Britain. He expressed a
desire that, with respect to the supplies, his people might
reap some immediate benefit from the present circumstances
of affairs, abroad; and the earnestly recommended to their
consideration, means for preventing the plague, particularly
by providing against the practice of smuggling.</P>
<P>§ V. One of the first objects that attracted the attention
of the Upper House was the oase of John Law, the famous
projector. The resentment of the people on account of
his Mississippi scheme had obliged him to leave France.
He retired to Italy; and was said to have visited the Pre∣tender
at Rome. From thence he repaired to Hanover;
<PB N="384" REF="390"/>
and returned to England from the Baltick, in the fleet
commanded by Sir John Norris. The King favoured
him with a private audience: he kept open house, and
was visited by great numbers of persons of the first quality.
Earl Coningsby represented, in the House of Lords, that
he could not but entertain some jealousy of a person who
had done so much mischief in a neighbouring kingdom;
who, being immensely rich, might do a great deal more
hurt here, by tampering with those who were grown de∣sperate,
in consequence of being involved in the calamity
occasioned by the fatal imitation of his pernicious projects.
He observed, that this person was the more dangerous, as
he had renounced his natural affection to his country, his
allegiance to his lawful sovereign, and his religion, by
turning Roman Catholick. Lord Carteret replied, that
Mr. Law had, many years ago, the misfortune to kill a
gentleman in a duel; but having at last received the benefit
of the King's clemency, and the appeal lodged by the re∣lations
of the deceased being taken off, he was come over
to plead his Majesty's pardon. He said there was no law to
keep any Englishman out of his country; and, as Mr. Law
was a subject of Great-Britain, it was not even in the King's
power to hinder him from coming over. After some dispute,
the subject was dropped, and this great projector pleaded
his pardon in the King's-Bench, according to the usual form.</P>
<P>§ VI. The ministry had by this time secured such a
majority in both Houses, as enabled them to carry any
point without the least difficulty. Some chiefs of the op∣position
they had brought over to their measures, and
among the rest Lord Harcourt, who was created a viscount,
and gratified with a pension of four thousand pounds.
Nevertheless, they could not shut the mouths of the mi∣nority,
who still preserved the privilege of complaining.
Great debates were occasioned by the navy-debt, which
was increased to one million seven hundred thousand
pounds. Some members in both Houses affirmed that
such extraordinary expense could not be for the immediate
service of Great-Britain; but, in all probability, for the
<PB N="385" REF="391"/>
preservation of foreign acquisitions. The ministers an∣swered,
that near two-thirds of the navy-debts were con∣tracted
in the late reign; and the parliament acquiesced
in this declaration: but, in reality, the navy debt had been
unnecessarily increased, by keeping seamen in pay during
the winter, and sending fleets to the Mediterranean and
Baltick, in order to support the interests of Germany.
The Duke of Wharton moved that the treaty with Spain
might be laid before the House. The Earl of Sunderland
said it contained a secret article, which the King of Spain
desired might not be made publick, until after the treaty
of Cambray should be discussed. The question was put,
and the Duke's motion rejected. The Earl of Strafford
asserted, that as the war with Spain had been undertaken
without necessity or just provocation, so the peace was
concluded without any benefit or advantage: that, con∣trary
to the law of nations, the Spanish fleet had been
attacked without any declaration of war: even while a
British minister and a secretary of state were treating ami∣cably
at Madrid: that the war was neither just nor poli∣tick,
since it interrupted one of the most valuable branches
of the English commerce, at a time when the nation
groaned under the pressure of heavy debts, incurred by
the former long, expensive war. He, therefore, moved for
an address to his Majesty, desiring that the instructions
given to Sir George Byng, now Lord Torrington, should
be laid before the House. This motion being likewise,
upon the question, rejected, a protest was entered. They
voted an address, however, to know in what manner the
King had disposed of the ships taken from the Spaniards.
Disputes arose also from the bill to prevent infection.
Earl Cowper represented, that the removal of persons to
a Lazaret, or pest-house, by order of the government,
and the drawing lines and trenches round places in∣fected,
were powers unknown to the British constitution;
inconsistent with the lenity of a free government; such as
could never be wisely or usefully put in practice; the more
odious, because copied from the arbitrary government of
<PB N="386" REF="392"/>
France; and impracticable, except by military compulsion.
These obnoxious clauses were accordingly repealed, though
not without great opposition. Indeed, nothing can be
more absurd than a constitution that will not admit of just
and necessary laws and regulations to prevent the dire con∣sequences
of the worst of all calamities. Such restrictions,
instead of favouring the lenity of a free government, would
be the most cruel imposition that could be laid on a free
people, as it would act in diametrical opposition to the
great principle of society, which is the preservation of the
individual.</P>
<P>§ VII. The Quakers having presented a petition to the
House of Commons, praying that a bill might be brought
in for omitting in their solemn affirmation the words “In
the presence of Almighty God,” the House complied
with their request: but the bill gave rise to a warm debate
among the peers. Dr. Atterbury, Bishop of Rochester, said
he did not know why such a distinguishing mark of indul∣gence
should be allowed to a set of people who were hardly
Christians. He was supported by the Archbishop of York,
the Earl of Strafford, and Lord North and Grey. A
petition was presented against the bill by the London
clergy, who expressed a serious concern lest the minds of
good men should be grieved and wounded, and the ene∣mies
of Christianity triumph, when they should see such
condescension made by a christian legislature to a set of
men who renounce the divine institutions of Christ; par∣ticularly
that by which the faithful are initiated into his
religion, and denominated Christians. The petition,
though presented by the Archbishop of York, was branded
by the ministry as a seditious libel, and rejected by the
majority. Then, upon a motion by the Earl of Sunder∣land,
the House resolved, that such lords as might enter
protestations with reasons should do it before two o'clock
on the next sitting day, and sign them before the House
rises.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals.</NOTE> The supplies being granted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. Reg.</NOTE> and the business of the

proclamation. In the election of members for the new
parliament the ministry exerted itself with such success,
as returned a great majority in the House of Commons,
extremely well adapted for all the purposes of an admini∣stration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Earl of Sunderland died in April, after having incurred a great load of popular odium, from his supposed connexions with the directors of the South Sea company. He was a minister of abilities, but violent, impetuou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and headstrong. His death was soon followed by that of his father-in-law, the great Duke of Marlborough, whose faculties had been for some time greatly impaired. He was interred in Westmister abbey, with such pro∣fusion of tuneral pomp, as evinced the pride and ostentation, much more than the taste and concern of those who directed his obsequies. He was succeeded as master of the Ordnance, and colonel of the first regiment of foot-guards, by Earl Cadogan.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>§ VIII. In the beginning of May,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1722.</NOTE> the King is said to
have received of the Duke of Orleans full and certain in∣formation
of a fresh conspiracy formed against his person
and government. A camp was immediately formed in
Hyde-park. All military officers were ordered to repair
to their respective commands. Lieutenant-General Mac∣cartney
was dispatched to Ireland, to bring over some
troops from that kingdom. Some suspected persons were
apprehended in Scotland: the states of Holland were desired
to have their auxiliary or guarantee troops in readiness to
be embarked; and Colonel Churchill was sent to the
court of France with a private commission. The appre∣hension
raised by this supposed plot affected the publick
credit. South-Sea stock began to fall; and crouds of
people called in their money from the Bank. Lord
Townshend wrote a letter to the Mayor of London, by
the King's command, signifying his Majesty's having re∣ceived
unquestionable advices, that several of his subjects
had entered into a wicked conspiracy, in concert with
traitors abroad, for raising a rebellion in favour of a popish
pretender; but that he was firmly assured the authors of it
neither were nor would be supported by any foreign power.
This letter was immediately answered by an affectionate
address from the court of aldermen; and the example of
<PB N="388" REF="394"/>
London was followed by many other cities and boroughs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1722.</NOTE>
The King had determined to visit Hanover, and actually
settled a regency, in which the Prince of Wales was not
included: but now this intended journey was laid aside:
the court was removed to Kensington, and the Prince re∣tired
to Richmond. The Bishop of Rochester having
been seised, with his papers, was examined before a com∣mittee
of the council, who committed him to the Tower
for high-treason. The Earl of Orrery, Lord North
and Grey, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Smith, from Scotland,
and Mr. Christopher Layer, a young gentleman of the
Temple, were confined in the same place. Mr. George
Kelly, an Irish clergyman, Mr. Robert Cotton of Hunt∣ingdonshire,
Mr. Bingley, Mr. Fleetwood, Neynoe, an
Irish Priest, and several persons, were taken into custody;
and Mr. Shippen's house was searched. After Bishop
Atterbury had remained a fortnight in the Tower, Sir
Constantine Phipps presented a petition to the court at
the Old-Bailey, in the name of Mrs. Morris, that prelate's
daughter, praying, that, in consideration of the Bishop's
ill state of health, he might be either brought to a speedy
trial, bailed, or discharged: but this was over-ruled.
The churchmen through the whole kingdom were filled
with indignation at the confinement of a bishop, which
they said was an outrage upon the church of England, and
the episcopal order. Far from concealing their sentiments
on this subject, the clergy ventured to offer up publick
prayers for his health, in almost all the churches and
chapels of London and Westminster. In the mean time,
the King, attended by the Prince of Wales, made a summer
progress through the western counties.</P>
<P>§ IX. The new parliament being assembled on
the ninth day of October, his Majesty made them ac∣quainted
with the nature of the conspiracy. He said
the conspirators had, by their emissaries, made the
strongest instances for succours from foreign powers;
but were disappointed in their expectations. That, never∣theless,
considing in their numbers, they had resolved
<PB N="389" REF="395"/>
once more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. III. 1722.</NOTE> upon their own strength, to attempt the sub∣version
of his government. He said they had provided
considerable sums of money, engaged great numbers of
officers from abroad, secured large quantities of arms and
ammunition; and, had not the plot been timely discover∣ed,
the whole nation, and particularly the city of Lon∣don,
would have been involved in blood and confusion.
He expatiated upon the mildness and integrity of his own
government; and inveighed against the ingratitude, the
implacability, and madness of the disaffected, concluding
with an assurance, that he would steadily adhere to the
constitution in church and state, and continue to make the
laws of the realm the rule and measure of all his actions.
Such addresses were presented by both Houses as the fears
and attachment of the majority may be supposed to have
dictated on such an occasion. A bill was brought into
the House of Lords, for suspending the Habeas Corpus act
for a whole year: but they were far from being unanimous
in agreeing to such an unusual length of time. By this sus∣pension,
they in effect vested the ministry with a dictatorial
power, over the liberties of the people.</P>
<P>§ X. The opposition in the House of Commons was so
violent, that Mr. Robert Walpole found it necessary to
alarm their apprehensions by a dreadful story of a design to
seise the Bank and Exchequer, and to proclaim the Pre∣tender
on the Royal Exchange. Their passions being
inflamed by this ridiculous artifice, they passed the bill, which
immediately received the royal assent. The Duke of Nor∣folk
being brought from Bath, was examined before the
council, and committed to the Tower, on suspicion of
high-treason. On the sixteenth day of November, the
King sent to the House of Peers the original and printed
copy of a declaration signed by the Pretender. It was
dated at Lucca, on the twentieth day of September, in
the present year, and appeared to be a proposal addressed to
the subjects of Great-Britain and Ireland, as well as to all
foreign princes and states. In this paper, the Chevalier
de St. George, having mentioned the late violations of the
<PB N="390" REF="396"/>
freedom of elections; conspiracies invented to give a colour
to new oppressions; infamous informers; and the state of
proscription in which he supposed every honest man to
be, very gravely proposed, that if King George would re∣linquish
to him the throne of Great-Britain, he would,
in return, bestow upon him the title of king in his native
dominions, and invite all other states to confirm it: he
likewise promised to leave to King George his succession
to the British dominions secure, whenever, in due course,
his natural right should take place. The Lords unani∣mously
resolved, that this declaration was a false, insolent,
and traitorous libel; and ordered it to be burned at the
Royal Exchange. The Commons concurred in these
resolutions. Both Houses joined in an address, expressing
their utmost astonishment and indignation at the surprising
insolence of the Pretender; and assuring his Majesty,
they were determined to support his title to the crown
with their lives and fortunes. The Commons prepared a
bill for raising one hundred thousand pounds upon the real
and personal estates of all papists, or persons educated in
the popish religion, towards defraying the expenses oc∣casioned
by the late rebellion and disorders. This bill,
though strenuously opposed by some moderate members, as
a species of persecution, was sent up to the House of Lords,
together with another, obliging all persons, being papists,
in Scotland, and all persons in Great-Britain refusing and
neglecting to take the oaths appointed for the security of the
King's person and government, to register their names and
real estates. Both these bills passed through the Upper
House without amendments, and received the royal sanction.</P>
<P>§ XI. Mr. Layer being brought to his tryal at the
King's-Bench, on the twenty-first day of November,
was convicted of having inlisted men for the Pretender<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
service, in order to stir up a rebellion, and received sen∣tence
of death. He was reprieved for some time, and ex∣amined
by a committee of the House of Commons: but
be either could not, nor would not, discover the particulars
of the conspiracy, so that be suffered death at Tyburn,
<PB N="391" REF="397"/>
and his head was fixed up at Temple-Bar. Mr. Pulteney,
chairman of the committee, reported to the House, that,
from the examination of Layer and others, a design had
been formed by persons of figure and distinction at home,
in conjunction with traitors abroad, for placing the Pre∣tender
on the throne of these realms: that their first inten∣tion
was to procure a body of foreign troops to invade the
kingdom at the time of the late elections; but that the con∣spirators
being disappointed in this expectation, resolved to
make an attempt at the time that it was generally believed
the King intended to go to Hanover, by the help of such
officers and soldiers as could pass into England unobserved,
from abroad, under the command of the late Duke of Or∣mond,
who was to have landed in the river with a great
quantity of arms, provided in Spain for that purpose; at
which time the Tower was to have been seised. That this
scheme being also defeated by the vigilance of the govern∣ment,
they deferred their enterprise till the breaking up of
the camp; and, in the mean time, employed their agents
to corrupt and seduce the officers and soldiers of the army:
that it appeared from several letters and circumstances, that
the late Duke of Ormond, the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl
of Orrery, Lord North and Grey, and the Bishop of Ro∣chester,
were concerned in this conspiracy, that their act∣ing
agents were Christopher Layer and John Plunket, who
travelled together to Rome; Dennis Kelly, George Kelly,
and Thomas Carte, nonjuring clergymen, Neynoe, the
Irish priest, who by this time was drowned in the river
Thames, in attempting to make his escape from the mes∣senger's
house, Mrs. Spilman, alias Yallop, and John
Sample.</P>
<P>§ XII. This pretended conspiracy, in all likelihood,
extended no farther than the first rudiments of a design
that was never digested into any regular form; otherwise
the persons said to be concerned in it must have been infa∣tuated
to a degree of phrenzy: for they were charged with
having made application to the Regent of France, who
was well known to be intimately connected with the King
<PB N="392" REF="398"/>
of Great-Britain. The House of Commons, however,
resolved, that it was a detestable and horrid conspiracy
for raising a rebellion, seising the Tower and the city of
London, laying violent hands upon the persons of his most
sacred Majesty and the Prince of Wales, in order to sub∣vert
our present happy establishment in church and state,
by placing a popish Pretender upon the throne: that it was
formed and carried on by persons of figure and distinction,
and their agents and instruments, in conjunction with
traitors abroad. Bills were brought in, and passed, for
inflicting pains and penalties against John Plunket and
George Kelly, who were by these acts to be kept in close
custody, during his Majesty's pleasure, in any prison in
Great-Britain; and that they should not attempt to escape
on pain of death, to be inflicted upon them and their assist∣ants.
Mr. Yonge made a motion for a bill of the same
nature against the Bishop of Rochester. This was immedi∣ately
brought into the House, though Sir William Wynd∣ham
affirmed there was no evidence against him but con∣jectures
and hearsays. The Bishop wrote a letter to the
Speaker,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals.</NOTE> importing, that though conscious of his own
innocence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tindal.</NOTE> he should decline giving the House any trou∣ble
that day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deb. in Par.</NOTE> contenting himself with the opportunity of
making his defence before another,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Polit. State.</NOTE> of which he had the
honour to be a member. Counsel being heard for the
bill, it was committed to a grand committee on the sixth
day of April, when the majority of the Tory members
quitted the House. It was then moved, that the Bishop
should be deprived of his office and benefice, and banished
the kingdom for ever: Mr. Lawson and Mr. Oglethorp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
spoke in his favour.</P>
<P>§ XIII. The bill being passed and sent up to the Lords
the Bishop was brought to his trial before them on the ninth
of May.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1723.</NOTE> Himself and his counsel having been heard,
the Lords proceeded to consider the articles of the bill:
when they read it a third time, a motion was made to pass
it, and then a long and warm debate ensued. Earl Paulet
demonstrated the danger and injustice of swerving in such
<PB N="393" REF="399"/>
an extraordinary manner from the fixed rules of evidence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. III. 1723.</NOTE>
The Duke of Wharton, having summed up the depositions,
and proved the insufficiency of them, concluded with say∣ing,
that let the consequences be what they would, he
hoped such a hellish stain would never fully the lustre and
glory of that illustrious House, as to condemn a man
without the least evidence. Lord Bathurst spoke against
the bill with equal strength and eloquence. He said, if
such extraordinary proceedings were countenanced, he saw
nothing remaining for him and others to do, but to retire
to their country houses, and there, if possible, quietly
enjoy their estates within their own families, since the
least correspondence, the least intercepted letter, might he
made criminal. He observed, that Cardinal Mazarin
boasted, that if he had but two lines of any man's
writing, he could, by means of a few circumstances, at∣tested
by witnesses, deprive him of his life at his pleasure.
Turning to the bench of bishops, who had been generally
unfavourable to Dr. Atterbury, he said he could hardly
account for the inveterate hatred and malice some persons
bore the learned and ingenious Bishop of Rochester, unless
they were intoxicated with the infatuation of some savage
Indians, who believed they inherited not only the spoils,
but even the abilities of any great enemy whom they
had killed in battle. The bill was supported by the Duke
of Argyle, the Earl of Seafield, and Lord Lechmere, which
last was answered by Earl Cowper. This nobleman ob∣served
that the strongest argument urged in behalf of the
bill was necessity; but that, for his part, he saw no ne∣cessity
that could justify such unprecedented and such
dangerous proceedings, as the conspiracy had above twelve
months before been happily discovered, and the effects of
it prevented: that besides the intrinsick weight and strength
of the government, the hands of those at the helm had
been still further fortified by the suspension of the Habeas
Corpus act, and the additional troops which had been
raised. He said the known rules of evidence, as laid down
at first, and established by the law of the land, were the
<PB N="394" REF="400"/>
birthright of every subject in the nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1723.</NOTE> and ought to be
constantly observed, not only in the inferior courts of
judicature, but also in both Houses of parliament, till
altered by the legislature: that the admitting of the pre∣carious
and uncertain evidence of the clerks of the post∣office
was a very dangerous precedent. In former times
(said he) it was thought very grievous that in capital cases
a man should be affected by similitude of hands; but
here the case is much worse, since it is allowed that the
clerks of the post-office should carry the similitude of
hands four months in their minds. He applauded the
Bishop's noble deportment, in declining to answer before
the House of Commons, whose proceedings in this un∣precedented
manner, against a lord of parliament, was such
an encroachment on the prerogative of the peerage, that if
they submitted to it, by passing the bill, they might be term∣ed
the last of British peers, for giving up their ancient pri∣vileges.
The other party were not so sollicitous about an∣swering
reasons, as eager to put the question, when the bill
passed, and a protest was entered. By this act the Bishop
was deprived of all offices, benefices, and dignities, and
rendered incapable of enjoying any for the future: he was
banished the realm, and subjected to the pains of death in
case he should return, as were all persons who should cor∣respond
with him during his exile. Dr. Friend, the cele∣brated
physician, who was a member of the House, and
had exerted himself strenuously in behalf of the Bishop,
was now taken into custody, on suspicion of treasonable
practices.</P>
<P>§ XIV. The next object that excited the resentment of
the Commons was the scheme of a lottery, to be drawn at
Harburgh, in the King's German dominions. The House
appointed a committee to enquire into this and other lot∣teries
at that time on foot in London. The scheme was
published, on pretense of raising a subscription for main∣taining
a trade between Great-Britain and the King's
territories on the Elbe: but it was a mysterious seene of
iniquity, which the committee, with all their penetration,
<PB N="395" REF="401"/>
could not fully discover.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. III. 1723.</NOTE> They reported, however, that it
was an infamous, fraudulent undertaking, whereby many
unwary persons had been drawn in, to their great loss:
that their manner of carrying it on had been a manifest
violation of the laws of the kingdom: That the managers
and agents of this lottery had, without any authority for
so doing, made use of his Majesty's royal name, thereby
to give countenance to the infamous project, and induce
his Majesty's subjects to engage or be concerned therein.
A bill was brought in to suppress this lottery; and to
oblige the managers of it to make restitution of the money
they had received from the contributors. At the same
time the House resolved, That John Lord Viscount Bar∣rington
had been notoriously guilty of promoting, abet∣ting,
and carrying on that fraudulent undertaking; for
which offence he should be expelled the House. The
court of Vienna having erected an East-India company at
Ostend, upon a scheme formed by one Colebrook, an
English merchant, Sir Nathaniel Gould represented to the
House of Commons the great detriment which the English
East-India company had already received, and were likely
further to sustain, by this Ostend company. The House
immediately resolved, That for the subjects of this king∣dom
to subscribe, or be concerned in encouraging any
subscription, to promote an East-India company now
erecting in the Austrian Netherlands, was a high crime
and misdemeanour; and a law was enacted for preventing
British subjects from engaging in that enterprise. By an∣other
act relating to the South-Sea company, the two
millions of stock which had been annihilated were revived,
added to the capital, and divided among the proprietors.
A third law passed, for the more effectual execution of
justice in a part of Southwark, called the Mint, where a
great number of debtors had taken sanctuary, on the sup∣position
that it was a privileged place. On the twenty-seventh
day of May the session was closed, with a speech
that breathed nothing but panegyrick, acknowledgement,

and affection to a parliament which had complied with all
his Majesty's wishes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1723.</NOTE></P>
<P>§ XV. His Majesty, having ennobled the son of Mr.
Robert Walpole, in consideration of the father's services,
made a good number of church promotions. He admitted
the imprisoned lords and gentlemen to bail; granted a
pardon to Lord Bolingbroke; and ordered the Bishop of
Rochester to be conveyed to the continent. Then he
himself set out for Hanover, leaving the administration of
his kingdoms in the hands of a regency, Lord Harcourt
being one of the justices. The King was attended by the
two secretaries, Lords Townshend and Carteret, who were
counted able negociators. The affairs of the continent
had begun to take a new turn. The interests and con∣nexions
of the different princes were become perplexed and
embarrassed; and King George resolved to unravel them
by dint of negociation. Understanding that a treaty was
on the carpet between the Czar and the King of Sweden,
favourable to the Duke of Holstein's pretensions to Sles∣wick,
the possession of which the Elector of Hanover had
guaranteed to Denmark, his Majesty began to be in pain
for Bremen and Verden. The Regent of France and the
King of Spain had now compromised all differences; and
their reconciliation was cemented by a double marriage
between Philip's sons and the Regent's daughters. The
former proposed new treaties to England; but insisted
upon the restitution of Gibraltar and Port-Mahon, as well
as upon the King's openly declaring against the Ostend
company. His Britannick Majesty was apprehensive, that
should the Emperor be hard pressed on that subject, he
might join the Czar and the King of Sweden, and promote
their designs in favour of the Duke of Holstein. On the
other hand, all the Italian powers exclaimed against the
treaty of London. The Pope had protested against any
thing that might have been decided at Cambray to the
prejudice of his right. Memorials to the same effect had
been presented by the King of Sardinia, the Dukes of
<PB N="397" REF="403"/>
Tuscany, Parma, and Modena. France and Spain were in∣clined
to support these potentates against the House of Au∣stria.
Europe seemed to be on the eve of a new war. King
George was entangled in such a variety of treaties and inte∣rests,
that he knew not well how to extricate himself from
the troublesome engagements he had contracted. By de∣claring
for the Emperor, he must have countenanced the
new establishment at Ostend, which was so prejudicial to
his British subjects, and incurred the resentment of France,
Spain, and their allies of Italy. In renouncing the interest
of the Emperor, he would have exposed his German do∣minions.
In vain he exhorted the Emperor to relax in his
disputes with Spain, and give up the Ostend company,
which was so detrimental and disagreeable to his faithful
allies: the court of Vienna promised in general to observe
the treaties which it had concluded; but declined entering
into any particular discussion; so that all his Majesty's en∣deavours
issued in contracting closer connexions with Prussia
and Denmark. All those negociations carried on, all those
treaties concluded by King George with almost every prince
and state in Christendom, which succeeded one another so
fast, and appear, at first view, so intricate and unaccount∣able,
were founded upon two simple and natural princi∣ples,
namely, the desire of ascertaining his acquisitions as
Elector of Hanover, and his resolution to secure himself
against the disaffection of his British subjects, as well as the
efforts of the Pretender.</P>
<P>§ XVI. Great-Britain at this period enjoyed profound
tranquillity. Ireland was a little ruffled by an incident
which seemed to have been misrepresented to the people of
that kingdom. William Wood had obtained a patent
for furnishing Ireland with copper currency, in which it
was deficient. A great clamour was raised against this
coin. The parliament of that kingdom, which met in
September, resolved, That it would be prejudicial to the
revenue, destructive of trade, and of dangerous conse∣quence
to the rights of the subject: that the patent had
<PB N="398" REF="404"/>
been obtained by misrepresentation: that the halfpence
wanted weight: that, even if the terms of the patent had
been complied with, there would have been a great loss to
the nation: that granting the power of coinage to a pri∣vate
person had ever been highly prejudicial to the king∣dom,
and would at all times be of dangerous consequence.
Addresses from both Houses were presented to the King
on this subject. The affair was referred to the lords of
the privy-council of England. They justified the conduct
of the patentee, upon the report of Sir Isaac Newton and
other officers of the Mint, who had made the assay and
trial of Wood's halfpence, and found he had complied
with the terms of the patent. They declared that this
currency exceeded in goodness, fineness, and value of
metal, all the copper money which had been coined for
Ireland, in the reigns of King Charles II. King James II.
King William and Queen Mary. The privy-council
likewise demonstrated, that his Majesty's predecessors had
always exercised the undoubted prerogative of granting
patents for copper coinage in Ireland to private persons:
that none of these patents had been so beneficial to the
kingdom as this granted to William Wood, who had not
obtained it in an unprecedented manner, but after a re∣ference
to the Attorney and Sollicitor General, and after
Sir Isaac Newton had been consulted in every particular▪
finally, they proved, by a great number of witnesses, that
there was a real want of such money in Ireland. Notwith∣standing
this decision, the ferment of the Irish nation was
industriously kept up by clamour, pamphlets, papers, and
lampoons, written by Dean Swift, and other authors; so
that Wood voluntarily reduced his coinage from the value
of one hundred thousand to that of forty thousand pounds.
Thus the noise was silenced. The Commons of Ireland
passed an act for accepting the affirmation of the Quakers
instead of an oath; and voted three hundred and forty
thousand pounds towards discharging the debt of the na∣tion,
which amounted to about double that sum.</P>
<P><PB N="399" REF="405"/>
§ XVII. In the month of October, England lost a worthy
nobleman in the death of Earl Cowper, who had twice dis∣charged
the office of lord-chancellor, with equal discern∣ment
and integrity. He was profoundly skilled in the laws
of his country; in his apprehension quick and penetrating:
in his judgement clear and determinate. He possessed a
manly eloquence: his manner was agreeable, and his de∣portment
graceful. This year was likewise remarkable for
the death of the Duke of Orleans, Regent of France, who,
since the decease of Lewis XIV. had ruled that nation with
the most absolute authority. He was a prince of taste and
spirit, endowed with shining talents for empire, which he
did not fail to display, even in the midst of effeminate pur∣suits
and idle debauchery. From the infirm constitution of
the infant king, he had conceived hopes of ascending the
throne, and taken his measures accordingly: but the young
monarch's health began to be established, and all the Duke's
schemes were defeated by an apoplexy, of which he died,
in the fiftieth year of his age, after having nominated the
Duke of Bourbon as prime-minister. King George imme∣diately
received assurances of the good disposition of the
French court, to cultivate and even improve the good un∣derstanding
so happily established between France and
Great-Britain. The King arrived in England on the
eighteenth day of December; and on the ninth day of Ja∣nuary
the parliament was assembled. His Majesty, in his
speech, recommended to the Commons the care of the pub∣lick
debts; and he expressed his satisfaction at seeing the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inking fund improved and augmented, so as to put the
debt of the nation into a method of being speedily and
gradually discharged.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. This was the repeated theory of patriotism,
which unhappily for the subjects was never reduced to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ractice: not but that a beginning of such a laudable
work was made in this very session, by an act for lessening
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e publick debts. This law provided, that the annuities
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t five per cent. charged on the general fund by a former
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct, except such as had been subscribed into the South-Sea,
<PB N="400" REF="406"/>
together with the undescribed blanks of the lottery in the
year one thousand seven hundred and fourteen, should be
paid off at Lady-day of the year next ensuing, with the
money arising from the sinking fund. The ministry, how∣ever,
did not persevere in this path of prudent oeconomy.
The Commons granted all the supplies that were demand∣ed.
They voted ten thousand seamen; and the majority,
though not without violent opposition, agreed to maintain
four thousand additional troops, which had been raised in
the preceding year; so that the establishment of the land
forces amounted to eighteen thousand two hundred and
sixty-four.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oldmixon. Polit. Stat. Hist. Reg. Annals of K. George. Mem. Hist. Tindal.</NOTE> The expense of the year was defrayed by a
land-tax and malt-tax. The Commons having dispatched
the supply, took into consideration a grievance arising from
protections granted by foreign ministers, peers, and mem∣bers
of parliament, under which profligate persons used to
screen themselves from the prosecution of their just credi∣tors.
The Commons resolved, That all protections granted
by members of that House should be declared void, and
immediately withdrawn. The Lords made a declaration
to the same purpose, with an exception of menial servants,
and those necessarily employed about the estates of peers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Duke of Newcastle was now appointed secretary of state; the Duke of Grafton, lord-chamberlain; and Lord Carteret, lord-lieutenant of Ireland.</P>

<P>Dr. Henry Sacheverel died in June, after having bequeathed five hundred pounds to the late Bishop of Rochester.</P>.</NOTE>
On the twenty-fourth day of April,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1724.</NOTE> his Majesty closed the
session in the usual manner; made some alterations in the
disposition of the great offices of state, and sent Mr. Ho∣ratio
Walpole as ambassador extraordinary to the court of
France.</P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="407"/>
§ XIX. In the beginning of this year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. III. 1724.</NOTE> Philip King of
Spain, retiring with his queen to the monastery of St. Ilde∣fonso,
sent the Marquis of Grimaldi, his principal secre∣tary
of state, to his son, Louis Prince of Asturias, with a
solemn renunciation of the crown, and a letter of advice,
in which he exhorted him to cultivate the Blessed Virgin
with the warmest devotion; and put himself and his king∣doms
under her protection. The renunciation was pub∣lished
through the whole monarchy of Spain; and the coun∣cil
of Castile resolved, That Louis might assume the reins
of government without assembling the cortez. The Eng∣lish
minister at Paris was instructed to interpose in behalf
of the French protestants, against whom a severe edict had
been lately published; but his remonstrances produced no
effect. England, in the mean time, was quite barren of
such events as deserve a place in history. The govern∣ment
was now firmly established on the neck of opposi∣tion;
and commerce flourished even under the load of
grievous imposition.</P>
<P>§ XX. The next parliament, which met on the twelfth
day of November, seemed to be assembled for no other
purpose than that of establishing funds for the expense of
the ensuing year: yet the session was distinguished by a
remarkable incident; namely, the trial of the Earl of
Macclesfield, lord-chancellor of England. This nobleman
had connived at certain venal practices touching the sale
of places, and the money of suitors deposited with the
masters of Chancery, so as to incur the general reproach of
the nation. He found it necessary to resign the great-seal
in the beginning of January. On the ninth day of the
ensuing month, the King sent a message to the Commons,
importing that his Majesty, having reason to apprehend
that the suitors in the court of Chancery were in danger
of losing a considerable sum of money, from the insuffi∣ciency
of some of the masters, thought himself obliged in
justice and compassion to the said sufferers to take the most
speedy and proper method the law would allow, for en∣quiring
into the state of the masters' accounts, and securing
<PB N="402" REF="408"/>
their effects for the benefit of the suitors;<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1724.</NOTE> and his Majesty
having had several reports laid before him, in pursuance of
the directions he had given, had ordered the reports to be
communicated to the House, that they might have as full
and as perfect a view of this important affair as the short∣ness
of the time, and the circumstances and nature of the
proceedings would admit.</P>
<P>§ XXI. These papers being taken into consideration,
Sir George Oxenden observed, that enormous abuses had
crept into the high court of Chancery: that the crimes
and misdemeanours of the late Lord-Chancellor were many
and various, but might be reduced to the following heads:
that he had embezzled the estates and effects of many
widows, orphans, and lunaticks: that he had raised the
offices of masters in Chancery to an exorbitant price:
trusting in their hands large sums of money belonging to
suitors, that they might be enabled to comply with his
exorbitant demands; and that in several cases he had made
divers irregular orders. He, therefore, moved, That Tho∣mas
Earl of Macclesfield should be impeached of high
crimes and misdemeanours. Mr. Pulteney moved, That
this affair might be left to the consideration of a select
committee.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals. Mem. Hist. Deb. in Par. Tindal.</NOTE> Sir William Wyndham asserted, that in pro∣ceeding
by way of impeachment upon reports from above,
they would make a dangerous precedent; and seem to give
up the most valuable of their privileges, the inquest after
state criminals. The question being put, it was carried
for the impeachment. The Earl was accordingly im∣peached
at the bar of the Upper-House; a committee was
appointed to prepare articles; and a bill was brought in, to
indemnify the masters in Chancery from the penalties of
the law, upon discovering what considerations they had
paid for their admission to their respective offices. The
trial lasted twenty days;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1725.</NOTE> the Earl was convicted of frau∣dulent
practices; and condemned in a fine of thirty thou∣sand
pounds, with imprisonment until that sum should be
paid. He was immediately committed to the Tower,
where he continued about six weeks; but upon producing
<PB N="403" REF="409"/>
the money he was discharged; and Sir Peter King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. III. 1725.</NOTE> now
created Baron of Oakham, succeeded him in the office of
chancellor.</P>
<P>§ XXII. His Majesty, on the eighth day of April, gave
the House of Commons to understand, that having been
engaged in some extraordinary expenses, he hoped he
should be enabled to raise a sum of money, by making use
of the funds lately established for the payment of the civil∣list
annuities, in order to discharge the debts contracted in
his civil government. Mr. Pulteney, cofferer of the house∣hold,
moved for an address, That an account should be
laid before the House of all monies paid for secret-service,
pensions, and bounties, from the twenty-fifth day of March,
in the year one thousand seven hundred and one, to the
twenty-fifth of the same month in the present year. This
address being voted, a motion was made to consider the
King's message. Mr. Pulteney urged, that this considera∣tion
should be postponed until the house should have exa∣mined
the papers that were the subject of the address. He
expressed his surprise that a debt amounting to above five
hundred thousand pounds should be contracted in three
years: he said he did not wonder that some persons should
be so eager to make good the deficiencies of the civil-list,
since they and their friends enjoyed such a share of that re∣venue;
and he desired to know, whether this was all that
was due, or whether they should expect another reckon∣ing?
This gentleman began to be dissatisfied with the
measures of the ministry; and his sarcasms were aimed at
Mr. Walpole, who undertook to answer his objections.
The Commons took the message into consideration, and
passed a bill, enabling his Majesty to raise any sum, not
exceeding one million, by Exchequer-Bills, loans, or other∣wise,
on the credit of the deductions of six-pence per
pound, directed by an act of parliament of the seventh year
of his Majesty, and of the civil-list revenues, at an interest
not exceeding three pounds per cent. till repayment of the
principal.</P>
<P><PB N="404" REF="410"/>
§ XXIII. On the twentieth day of April,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1725.</NOTE> a petition was
presented to the House by Lord Finch, in behalf of Henry
St. John, late Viscount Bolingbroke, praying that the exe∣cution
of the law with respect to his forefeitures might be
suspended, as a pardon had suspended it with respect to his
life. Mr. Walpole signified to the House, by his Majesty's
command, that seven years before, the petitioner had made
his humble application and submission to the King, with
assurances of duty, allegiance, and fidelity; that from his
behaviour since that time, his Majesty was convinced of
his being a fit object of his mercy; and consented to his pe∣titioning
the House. The petition being read, Mr. Wal∣pole
declared himself fully satisfied, that the petitioner had
sufficiently atoned for his past offences; and therefore de∣served
the favour of that House, so far as to enable him to
enjoy the family inheritance that was settled upon him,
which he could not do by virtue of his Majesty's pardon,
without an act of parliament. Lord Finch moved, That a
bill might be brought in for this purpose, and was warmly
opposed by Mr. Methuen, comptroller of the household,
who represented Bolingbroke as a monster of iniquity. His
remonstrance was supported by Lord William Paulet and
Mr. Onslow; nevertheless, the bill was prepared, passed
through both Houses, and received the royal assent. An act
being passed for disarming the Highlanders of Scotland; ano∣ther
for regulating elections within the city of London; a
third for reducing the interest of several Bank annuities, to∣gether
with some bills of a private nature, the parliament
was prorogued in May, after the King had, in the warmest
terms of acknowledgment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>On the fifth Day of December the Princess of Wales was delivered of a princess, christened by the name of Louisa, and afterwards married to the King of Denmark. She died December the nineteenth, one thousand seven hundred and fifty-one.</P>

<PB N="405" REF="411"/>
their conduct. Then he appointed lords-justices to govern
the nation in his absence; and set out in June for his Ger∣man
dominions.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. The tide of political interests on the continent
had begun to flow in a new channel, so as to render inef∣fectual
the mounds which his Britannick Majesty had raised
by his multiplicity of negociations. Louis, the Spanish mo∣narch,
dying soon after his elevation to the throne, his father
Philip resumed the crown which he had resigned; and gave
himself up implicitly to the conduct of his queen, who was
a princess of indefatigable intrigue and insatiate ambition.
The Infanta, who had been married to Louis XV. of
France, was so disagreeable to her husband, that the whole
French nation began to be apprehensive of a civil war, in
consequence of his dying without male issue; he therefore
determined, with the advice of his council, to send back the
Infanta, as the nuptials had not been consummated; and
she was attended to Madrid by the Marquis de Monteleone.
The Queen of Spain resented this insult offered to her
daughter; and, in revenge, dismissed Mademoiselle de
Beaujolois, one of the Regent's daughters, who had been
betrothed to her son Don Carlos. As the congress at
Cambray had proved ineffectual, she offered to adjust her
differences with the Emperor, under the sole mediation of
Great-Britain. This was an honour which King George
declined. He was averse to any undertaking that might
interrupt the harmony subsisting between him and the
court of Versailles; and he had taken umbrage at the Em∣peror's
refusing to grant the investiture of Bremen and
Verden, except upon terms which he did not choose to
embrace. The peace between the courts of Vienna and
Madrid, which he refused to mediate, was effected by a
private negociation, under the management of the Duke
de Ripperda, a native of the States-General, who had re∣nounced
the protestant religion, and entered into the ser∣vice
of his Catholick Majesty. By two treaties, signed at
Vienna in the month of April, the Emperor acknowledged
<PB N="406" REF="412"/>
Philip as King of Spain and the Indies, promising that he
would not molest him in the possession of those dominions
that were secured to him by the treaty of Utrecht. Philip
renounced all pretensions to the dominions in Italy and the
Netherlands, adjudged to the Emperor by the treaty of
London: Charles granted the investiture of the dukedom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of Tuscany, Parma, and Placentia to the eldest son of
the Queen of Spain, in default of heirs in the present
possessors, as masculine fiefs of the empire. Spain became
guarantee of the Austrian succession, according to the
pragmatick sanction, by which the dominions of that
house were settled on the Emperor's heirs general, and de∣clared
to be perpetual, indivisible, and inseparable feoff∣ment
to the primogeniture. By the commercial treaty of
Vienna, the Austrian subjects were entitled to advantages
in trade with Spain, which no other nation enjoyed. His
Catholick Majesty guaranteed the Ostend East-India com∣pany;
and agreed to pay an annual subsidy of four mil∣lions
of piastres to the Emperor. Great sums were re∣mitted
to Vienna; the Imperial forces were augmented
to a formidable number; and other powers were sollicited
to engage in this alliance, to which the court of Petersburgh
actually acceded.</P>
<P>§ XXV. The King of Great-Britain took the alarm.
The Emperor and he had for some time treated each other
with manifest coldness. He had reason to fear some at∣tempt
upon his German dominions; and projected a de∣fensive
treaty with France and Prussia. This alliance,
limited to the term of fifteen years, was negociated and
concluded at Hanover, in the month of September. It
implied a mutual guarantee of the dominions possessed by
the contracting parties, their rights and privileges, those
of commerce in particular, and an engagement to procure
satisfaction to the protestants of Thorn, who had lately
been oppressed by the Catholicks, contrary to the treaty of
Oliva. The King having taken these precautions at
Hanover, set out on his return for England; embarked
at Helvoetsluya in the middle of December; and after
<PB N="407" REF="413"/>
having been exposed to the fury of a dreadful storm, was
landed with great difficulty at Rye, from whence he pro∣ceeded
by land to London. The parliament meeting on
the twentieth day of the next month, he gave them to
understand, that the distressed condition of some of their
protestant brethren abroad, and the negociations and en∣gagements
contracted by some foreign powers, which seem∣ed
to have laid the foundation of new troubles and distur∣bances
in Europe, and to threaten his subjects with the
loss of several of the most advantageous branches of their
trade, had obliged him to concert with other powers such
measures as might give a check to the ambitious views of
those who were endeavouring to render themselves formi∣dable;
and put a stop to the further progress of such dan∣gerous
designs. He told them, that the enemies of his
government were already very busy, by their instruments
and emissaries in those courts whose measures seemed most
to favour their purposes, in solliciting and promoting the
cause of the Pretender. One sees, at first sight, that the
interests of Germany dictated the treaty of Hanover; but,
in order to secure the approbation of Great-Britain, upon
which the support of this alliance chiefly depended, it was
judged necessary to insert the articles relating to commerce
and the protestant religion, as if the engagement had been
contracted purely for the advantage and glory of England.
In a word, the ministry began now to ring the changes
upon a few words that have been repeated ever since, like
cabalistical sounds, by which the nation has been enchanted
into a very dangerous connexion with the concerns of the
continent. They harangued, they insisted upon the
machinations of the disaffected, the designs of a popish
Pretender, the protestant interest, and the balance of
power, until these expressions became absolutely terms of
ridicule with every person of common sense and reflexion.
The people were told, that the Emperor and the King of
Spain, exclusive of the publick treaties concluded at
Vienna, had entered into private engagements, importing,
that the Imperialists should join the Spaniards in recovering
<PB N="408" REF="414"/>
Gibraltar and Port-Mahon by force of arms, in case the
King of England should refuse to restore them amicably,
according to a solemn promise he had made: that a double
marriage should take place between the two Infants of
Spain, and the two Archduchesses of Austria; and that
means should be taken to place the Pretender on the throne
of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. When the treaties of Vienna and Hanover
fell under consideration of the House of Commons, Horatio
Walpole, afterwards termed, in derision, “the balance-master,”
opened the debate with a long, unanimated
oration, giving a detail of the affairs of Europe since the
treaty of Utrecht. He enumerated the barrier-treaty, the
convention for executing that treaty, the defensive alliance
with the Emperor, the other with the Most Christian King
and the States-General, another convention, the quadruple
alliance, the congress at Cambray, the treaty of Hanover,
and that of Vienna. He explained the nature of each en∣gagement.
He said, the main design of the treaty of com∣merce
concluded between the Emperor and Spain, was to
countenance and support the East-India company esta∣blished
at Ostend, which interfered so essentially with the
East-India companies of England and Holland, and was
directly contrary to several solemn treaties still in force.
He enlarged upon the danger to which the balance of
power would be exposed, should the issue-male of this
projected marriage between the houses of Austria and Spain
ever possess the Imperial dignity and the kingdom of Spain
together. The reader will take notice, that this very man
was one of those who exclaimed against that article of the
treaty of Utrecht, which prevented the power of those two
houses from being immediately united in the person of the
Emperor. He did not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orget to expatiate upon the pre∣tended
secret engagement concerning Gibraltar and Mi∣norca;
and the King's pious concern for the distressed
protestants of Thorn in Poland. In vain did Mr. Shippen
urge, that the treaty of Hanover would engage the British
nation in a war for the defence of the King's German do∣minions,
<PB N="409" REF="415"/>
contrary to an express provision made in the act
of limitation. These arguments had lost all weight. The
opposition was so inconsiderable, that the ministry had no
reason to be in pain about any measure they should propose.
An address was voted and delivered to his Majesty, approv∣ing
the alliance he had concluded at Hanover, in order to
obviate and disappoint the dangerous views and conse∣quences
of the treaty of peace betwixt the Emperor and the
King of Spain; and promising to support his Majesty against
all insults and attacks that should be made upon any of his
territories, though not belonging to the crown of Great-Britain.
An address of the same kind was presented by
the House of Lords in a body. A bill was brought in,
empowering the commissioners of the Treasury to compound
with Mr. Richard Hampden, late treasurer of the navy, for
a debt he owed to the crown, amounting to eight-and-forty
thousand pounds. This deficiency was occasioned
by his embarking in the South-Sea scheme. The King
recommended his petition; and the House complied with
his request, in consideration of his great grandfather, the
famous John Hampden, who made such a noble stand
against the arbitrary measures of the first Charles.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. The malt-tax was found so grievous to
Scotland, that the people refused to pay it, and riots were
excited in different part of the kingdom. At Glasgow,
the populace, armed with clubs and staves, risled the house
of Daniel Campbell, their representative in parliament, who
had voted for the bill; and maltreated some excisemen, who
attempted to take an account of the malt. General Wade,
who commanded the forces in Scotland, had sent two
companies of soldiers, under the command of Captain
Bushel, to prevent or appease any disturbance of this nature.
That officer drew up his men in the street, where they
were pelted with stones by the multitude, which he en∣deavoured
to disperse, by siring among them without shot.
This expedient failing, he ordered his men to load their
pieces with ball, and at a time when the magistrates were
advancing towards him in a body, to assist him with their
<PB N="410" REF="416"/>
advice and influence, he commanded the soldiers to fire
four different ways, without the sanction of the civil au∣thority.
Above twenty persons were killed or wounded on
this occasion. The people seeing so many victims fall,
were exasperated beyond all sense of danger. They began
to procure arms, and breathed nothing but defiance and re∣venge.
Bushel thought proper to retreat to the castle of
Dumbarton; and was pursued above five miles by the en∣raged
multitude. General Wade being informed of this
transaction, assembled a body of forces; and being accom∣panied
by Duncan Forbes, lord-advocate, took possession
of Glasgow.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oldmixon. Annals. Deb. in Par. Mem. Hist. Tindal.</NOTE> The magistrates were apprehended, and
conveyed prisoners to Edinburgh, where the lords justi∣ciary,
having taken cognizance of the affair, declared
them innocent; so that they were immediately discharged.
Bushel was tried for murther, convicted, and condemned;
but, instead of undergoing the penalties of the law, he
was indulged with a pardon, and promoted in the service.
Daniel Campbell having petitioned the House of Com∣mons,
that he might be indemnified for the damage he
had sustained from the rioters, a bill passed in his favour,
granting him a certain sum, to be raised from an impo∣sition
laid upon all the beer and ale brewed in the city of
Glasgow. The malt-tax was so sensibly felt in Scotland,
that the convention of the royal burghs presented a re∣monstrance
against it, as a grievous burthen, which their
country could not bear: petitions to the same purport
were delivered to the Commons from different shires of
that kingdom.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Duke of Wharton, having consumed his fortune in riot and ex∣travagance, repaired to the court of Vienna, from whence he proceeded to Rome, and offered his service to the Pretender. There he received the order of the Garter, and the title of Duke of Northumberland. He was sent by the Chevalier de St. George with credentials to the court of Madrid, where he abjured the protestant religion, married a lady of the Queen of Spain's bed-chamber, and obtained the rank and appointments of a lieutenant colonel <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Spanish service.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1726.</NOTE> On the twenty-fourth day of March,
the King sent a message to the House by Sir Paul Me∣thuen,
desiring an extraordinary supply, that he might be
able to augment his maritime force, and concert such
<PB N="411" REF="417"/>
other measures as should be necessary in the present con∣juncture.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. III. 1726.</NOTE>
A debate ensued; but the majority comlied
with the demand. Some members in the Upper House
complained that the message was not sent to both Houses
of parliament; and this suggestion gave rise to another
debate, in which Lord Bathurst and others made some
melancholy reflexions upon the state of insignificance to
which the peers of England were reduced. Such remarks,
however, were very little minded by the ministry, who had
obtained a complete victory over all opposition. The
supplies ordinary and extraordinary being granted, with
every thing else which the court thought proper to ask, and
several bills passed for the regulation of civil oeconomy, the
King dismissed the parliament on the twenty-fourth day of
May.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. By this time Peter the Czar of Muscovy
was dead, and his empress Catharine had succeeded him
on the Russian throne. This princess had begun to assem∣ble
forces in the neighbourhood of Petersburgh; and to
prepare a formidable armament for a naval expedition.
King George, concluding that her design was against
Sweden, sent a strong squadron into the Baltick, under
the command of Sir Charles Wager, in order to antici∣pate
her views upon his allies. The English fleet being
joined at Copenhagen by a Danish squadron, alarmed the
court of Russia, which immediately issued orders for re∣enforcing
the garrisons of Wibourg, Cronslot, Revel, and
Riga. The English admiral, having had an audience of
his Swedish Majesty, steered towards Revel, and sent
thither a lieutenant, with a letter from the King of Great-Britain
to the Czarina. This was an expostulation, in
which his Majesty observed, that he and his allies could
not fail of being alarmed at her great preparations by
sea and land. He complained that measures had been
taken at her court in favour of the Pretender: that his
repeated instances for establishing a lasting friendship with
the crown of Russia had been treated with neglect; and he
gave her to understand, that he had ordered his admiral to
<PB N="412" REF="418"/>
prevent her ships from coming out of her harbours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1726.</NOTE> should
she persist in her resolution to execute the designs she had
projected. The Czarina, in her answer to the King, ex∣pressed
her surprise, that she had not received his Majesty's
letter until his fleet was at anchor before Revel, since it
would have been more agreeable to the custom established
among sovereigns, and to the amity which had so long
subsisted between her kingdoms and the crown of Great-Britain,
to expostulate with her on her armament, and ex∣pect
her answer, before he had proceeded to such an of∣fensive
measure. She assured him that nothing was far∣ther
from her thoughts than any designs to disturb the
peace of the North; and with regard to the Pretender, it
was a frivolous and stale accusation, which had been fre∣quently
used as a pretext to cover all the unkind steps
lately taken against the Russian empire. Sir Charles Wa∣ger
continued in his station until he received certain intel∣ligence
that the Russian gallies were laid up in their win∣ter
harbour: then he set for the coast of Denmark,
from whence he returned to England in the month of
November.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. King George, that he might not seem to con∣vert
all his attention to the affairs of the North, had equip∣ped
two other squadrons; one of which was destined for
the West-Indies, under the command of Admiral Hosier:
the other, conducted by Sir John Jennings, having on
board a body of land-forces, sailed from St. Helen's on
the twentieth day of July, entered the bay of St. Antonio,
then visited Lisbon, from whence he directed his course to
the bay of Bulls, near Cadiz, and cruised off Cape St.
Mary's, so as to alarm the coast of Spain, and fill Madrid
with consternation. Yet he committed no act of hostility;
but was treated with great civility by the Spanish governor
of Cadiz, who supplied him with refreshments. Re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>-Admiral
Hosier, with seven ships of war, had sailed in
April for the Spanish West-Indies, with instructions to
block up the galleous in the ports of that country; or,
should they presume to come out, to seise and bring them to
<PB N="413" REF="419"/>
England. Before his arrival at the Bastimentos, near
Porto-Bello, the treasure, consisting of above six millions
sterling, had been unloaded, and carried back to Panama,
in pursuance of an order sent by an advice-boat, which
had the start of Hosier. This admiral lay inactive on that
station, until he became the jest of the Spaniards. He
returned to Jamaica, where he found means to re-enforce
his crews: then he stood over to Carthagena. The
Spaniards had by this time seised the English South-Sea
ship at la Vera-Cruz, together with all the vessels and
effects belonging to that company. Hosier in vain de∣manded
restitution: he took some Spanish ships by way
of reprisal, and continued cruising in those seas until the
greater part of his men perished deplorably by the diseases
of that unhealthy climate; and his ships were totally
ruined by the worms. This brave officer being restricted
by his orders from obeying the dictates of his courage,
seeing his best officers and men daily swept off by an
outrageous distemper, and his ships exposed to inevitable
destruction, is said to have died of a broken heart; while
the people of England loudly clamoured against this un∣fortunate
expedition, in which so many lives were thrown
away, and so much money expended, without the least
advantage to the nation. It seems to have been a mean,
piratical scheme to rob the court of Spain of its expected
treasure, even while a peace subsisted between the two
nations. The ministry of Great-Britain indeed alledged,
that the Spanish King had entered into engagements in
favour of the Pretender.</P>
<P>§ XXX. The Dukes of Ormond and Wharton, and
the Earl Marischal, were certainly at Madrid; and the
Duke de Ripperda, now prime-minister of Spain, dropped
some expressions to the English envoy, that implied some
such design, which, however, the court of Madrid posi∣tively
denied. Ripperda, as a foreigner, fell a sacrifice
to the jealousy of the Spanish ministers. He was sud∣denly
dismissed from his employments, with a pension of
three thousand pistoles. He forthwith took refuge in the
<PB N="414" REF="420"/>
house of Vandermeer the Dutch ambassador, who was
unwilling to be troubled with such a guest. He, there∣fore,
conveyed the Duke in his coach to the house
of Colonel Stanhope, the British minister, whose pro∣tection
he craved and obtained. Nevertheless, he was
dragged from thence by force, and committed prisoner to
the castle of Segovia. He afterwards made his escape, and
sheltered himself in England, from the resentment of his
Catholick Majesty. Colonel Stanhope complained of this
violation of the law of nations, which the Spanish mini∣sters
endeavoured to excuse. Memorials and letters passed
between the two courts; and every thing tended to a
rupture. The King of Spain purchased ships of war;
began to make preparations for some important under∣taking;
and assembled an army of twenty thousand men
at St. Roch, on pretense of rebuilding the old castle of
Gibraltar. Mean while the States-General and the King
of Sweden acceded to the treaty of Hanover: but the King
of Prussia, though his Majesty's son-in-law, was detached
from the alliance by the Emperor, with whom he contracted
new engagements.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. On the seventeenth day of January, the Bri∣tish
parliament was opened with a long, elaborate speech,
importing that the proceedings and transactions of the
Emperor and King of Spain, and the secret offensive al∣liances
concluded between them, had laid the foundations
of a most exorbitant and formidable power: that they
were directly levelled against the most valuable and darling
interests and privileges of the English nation, which must
either give up Gibraltar to Spain, and acquiesce in the
Emperor's usurped exercise of commerce, or resolve vi∣gorously
to defend their undoubted rights against those
reciprocal engagements, contracted in defiance and vi∣olation
of all national faith, and the most solemn treaties.
He assured them, that one of those secret articles was, the
placing the Pretender on the throne of Great-Britain; and
another the conquest of Gibraltar and Port-Mahon. He
affirmed that those combinations extended themselves into
<PB N="415" REF="421"/>
Russia; and that the English fleet seasonably prevented
such designs as would have opened a way to the invasion of
these kingdoms. He exhorted the Commons to grant such
supplies as should be necessary for the defence of their
country, and for making good his engagements with the
allies of Great-Britain. He told them, that the King of
Spain had ordered his minister residing in England to quit
the kingdom; and that he had left a memorial, little short
of a declaration; in which he insisted upon the restitution
of Gibraltar. He did not fail to touch the energick strings
which always moved their passions; the balance of power
in Europe, the security of the British commerce, the de∣signs
of a popish pretender, the present happy establishment,
the religion, liberties, and properties of a protestant peo∣ple.
Such addresses of thanks were penned in both
Houses as the ministers were pleased to dictate; yet not
without opposition from a minority, which was far from
being formidable, though headed by chiefs of uncommon
talents and resolution. The Commons voted twenty
thousand seamen, besides six-and-twenty thousand three
hundred eighty-three men for the land-service; and, to
defray the extraordinary expense, a land-tax of sour shillings
in the pound was granted.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. The House of Lords having taken into con∣sideration
the letters and memorials between the ministers
of Great-Britain, France, and Spain, and the papers re∣lating
to the accession of the States-General to the treaty
of Hanover, a warm debate ensued. Lord Bathurst
took notice, that the accession of the States-General to
the treaty was upon condition that this their act should
be approved and ratified by the King of Great-Britain,
the Most Christian King, and the King of Prussia; but
that the minister of his Prussian Majesty had refused to sign
the act of accession, which was therefore of no effect: that
if the court of France should, for the same reason, think
itself disengaged from the Hanover alliance, Britain alone
would be obliged to bear the burthen of an expensive war
against two of the greatest potentates of Europe. He said
<PB N="416" REF="422"/>
he could not see any just reason for a rupture with Spain:
that indeed the Duke de Ripperda might have dropped
some indiscreet expressions: he was known to be a man of
a violent temper; and he had been solemnly disavowed by
his Catholick Majesty: that, in the memorial left by the
Spanish ambassador, he imputed the violent state of affairs
between the two crowns to the ministers of England; and
mentioned a positive promise made by the King of Great-Britain
for the restitution of Gibraltar: that methods of
accommodation might be tried, before the kingdom en∣gaged
in a war which must be attended with dangerous
consequences: that the nation was loaded with a debt of
fifty millions; and, in order to maintain such a war,
would be obliged to raise seven millions yearly; an annual
sum by which the people would soon be exhausted. He
observed, that in some papers laid before the House,
mention was made of great sums distributed in divers
places, to bring certain measures to bear. He declared,
that, for his own part, he had touched neither Spanish nor
English gold; he was neither a Spaniard nor a Frenchman,
but a true Englishman, and so long as he had the honour
to sit in that House, he would speak and act for the good
of his country. He, therefore, desired their lordships seri∣ously
to consider the matter before them, which was of the
last consequence and importance to the whole nation.
He said nothing could be gained by the war, should it prove
successful: and every thing would be lost should it be un∣prosperous.
He was answered by Lord Townshend, who
affirmed that his Majesty had received positive and certain
information with respect to the secret article of alliance
between the courts of Vienna and Madrid, in favour of
the Pretender, though the safety of the state did not permit
him to lay these advices before the parliament. After
much altercation, the majority resolved, that the measures
his Majesty had thought sit to take were honourable,
just, and necessary, for preventing the execution of the
dangerous engagements entered into in favour of the Pre∣tender;
for preserving the dominions belonging to the
<PB N="417" REF="423"/>
crown of Great-Britain by solemn treaties, and particu∣larly
those of Gibraltar and the island of Minorca; and
for maintaining to his people their most valuable rights and
privileges of commerce, and the peace and tranquillity of
Europe. Seventeen lords entered a protest against this
resolution. Disputes of the same nature arose from the
same subject in the Lower House. Lord Townshend
had affirmed in the House of Peers, that no promise of re∣storing
Gibraltar had been made: Sir Robert Walpole
owned such a promise in the House of Commons: a motion
was made for an address, desiring these engagements
might be laid before the House: another member moved
for a copy of the memorial presented by Mr. Pointz to the
King of Sweden, and for the secret offensive article be∣tween
the courts of Vienna and Madrid: a third motion
was made, to address the King for such memorials and re∣presentations
from the courts of Sweden and Denmark, as
induced him, in the course of the preceding year, to send
a squadron to the Baltick. In the account of the money
granted for the service of the last year, there was an article
of one hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds charged
in general terms, as issued out for other engagements and
expenses, over and above such as were specified. Mr.
Pulteney moved for an address on this subject; but each of
these motions was rejected on a division; and the majo∣rity
concurred in an address of thanks to his Majesty, for
the great wisdom of his conduct. They expressed the
most implicit confidence in his goodness and discretion:
they promised to support him in all such further measures
as he should find necessary and expedient for preventing a
rupture, as well as for consulting the honour and advan∣tage
of these kingdoms.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. His Majesty's speech gave such umbrage to
the Court of Vienna, that Mr. Palms, the Imperial resi∣dent
at London, was ordered to present a warm memorial
to the King, and afterwards to publish it to the whole
nation. In this bold remonstrance, the King was charged
with having declared from the throne, as certain and un∣doubted
<PB N="418" REF="424"/>
facts, several things that were either wrested, mis∣represented,
or void of all foundation. The memorialist
affirmed, that the treaty of Vienna was built on the qua∣druple
alliance: that the treaty of commerce was calcu∣lated
to promote the mutual and lawful advantages of the
subjects of both parties, agreeably to the law of nations;
and in no respect prejudicial to the British nation. He de∣clared,
that there was no offensive alliance concluded be∣tween
the two crowns: that the supposed article relating
to the Pretender was an absolute falsehood: that the in∣sinuation
with respect to the siege of Gibraltar was equally
untrue, his master having made no engagements with the
King of Spain but such as were specified in the treaty com∣municated
to his Britannick Majesty. He said, however,
the hostilities notoriously committed in the West-Indies,
and elsewhere, against the King of Spain, in violation of
treaties, seemed to justify that prince's undertaking the
siege of Gibraltar. Finally, he demanded, in the name of
his Imperial Majesty, suitable reparation for the injury his
honour had sustained from such calumnious imputations.
Both Houses of parliament expressed their indignation at
the insolence of this memorial, in an address to his Ma∣jesty;
and Mr. Palms was ordered to depart the kingdom.
Virulent declarations were presented by the minister of
the Emperor and the King of Great-Britain to the diet of
the empire at Ratisbon; and such personal reflexions re∣torted
between these two potentates, that all hope of recon∣ciliation
vanished.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. King George, in order to secure himself
against the impending storm, entered into more strict en∣gagements
with the French King; and agreed to pay fifty
thousand pounds for three years to the King of Sweden,
in consideration of that prince's holding in readiness a body
of ten thousand troops for the occasions of the alliance.
He concluded a fresh treaty with the King of Denmark,
who promised to furnish a certain number of auxiliaries,
on account of a large subsidy granted by the King of
France. The proportions of troops to be sent into the
<PB N="419" REF="425"/>
field, in case of a rupture, were ascertained. His Britan∣nick
Majesty engaged for four-and-twenty thousand men,
and a strong squadron to be sent into the Baltick. He
made a convention with the Prince of Hesse-Cassel, who
undertook to provide eight thousand infantry, and four
thousand horse, in consideration of seventy-four thousand
pounds, to be paid by Great-Britain immediately, and fifty
thousand pounds more in case the troops should be re∣quired,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals. Deb. in Par. Tindal. Lives of the Admirals.</NOTE>
besides their pay and subsistence. Such was the
fruit of all the alliances so industriously planned since the
accession of King George to the throne of Great-Britain.
In the day of his trouble, the King of Prussia, who had
espoused his daughter, deserted his interest; and the States-General
stood aloof. For the security of his German do∣minions,
he had recourse to the King of France, who
was a precarious ally; to the Kings of Sweden and Den∣mark,
and the principality of Hesse-Cassel: but none of
these powers would contribute their assistance without
being gratified with exorbitant subsidies, though the
danger was common, and the efforts ought to have been
equal. Instead of allies, they professed themselves merce∣naries.
Great-Britain paid them for the defence of their
own dominions; she, moreover, undertook to maintain a
powerful fleet for their safety. Is there any Briton so weak
as to think, or so fool-hardy as to affirm, that this was a
British quarrel.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. For the support of those expensive treaties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1727.</NOTE>
Mr. Scroope, secretary of the Treasury, moved in the
House of Commons, that in the malt-tax bill they should
insert a clause of appropriation, empowering the King to
apply such sums as should be necessary for defraying the
expenses and engagements which had been or should be
made before the twenty-fifth day of September, in con∣certing
such measures as he should think most conducive
to the security of trade, and restoring the peace of Europe.
To little purpose did the members in the opposition urge,
that this method of asking and granting supplies was un∣parliamentary:
that such a clause would render ineffectual
<PB N="420" REF="426"/>
that appropriation of the publick money,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Book II. 1727.</NOTE> which the wisdom
of all parliaments had thought a necessary security against
misapplication, which was the more to be feared, as no
provision was made to call any person to account for the
money that should be disposed of by virtue of this clause:
that great sums had already been granted: that such an
unlimited power ought never to be given in a free govern∣ment:
that such confidence in the crown might, through
the influence of evil ministers, be attended with the most
dangerous consequences: that the constitution could not
be preserved, but by a strict adherence to those essential
parliamentary forms of granting supplies upon estimates,
and of appropriating these supplies to services and occasions
publickly avowed and judged necessary: that such clauses,
if not seasonably checked, would become so frequent, as
in time to lodge in the crown, and in the ministers, an
absolute and uncontrollable power of raising money upon
the people, which by the constitution is, and with safety
can only be, lodged in the whole legislature. The motion
was carried, the clause added, and the bill passed through
the other House without amendment, though not without
opposition. Notwithstanding this vote of credit, Sir
William Yonge moved, that towards the supply granted
to the King, the sum of three hundred and seventy thou∣sand
pounds should be raised by loans on Exchequer-Bills,
to be charged on the surplus of the duties on coal and
culm, which was reserved for the parliament's disposal.
Though this motion was vigorously opposed by Sir Joseph
Jekyl and Mr. Pulteney, as a dangerous deviation from
several votes and acts of parliament, by which the exceed∣ings
of the publick funds were appropriated to the discharge
of the national debt, or to the increase of the sinking-fund,
it was carried by the majority.</P>
<P>§ XXXVI. On the fifteenth day of May the parliament
was prorogued, after the King had acknowledged their
zeal, liberality, and dispatch; and given them to under∣stand,
that the siege of Gibraltar was actually begun.
The trenches were opened before this sortress on the
<PB N="421" REF="427"/>
eleventh day of February,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. III. 1727.</NOTE> by the Condé de las Torres, at
the head of twenty thousand men. The place was well
provided for a defence; and the old Earl of Portmore, who
was governor, embarked with a re-enforcement from
England, under convoy of a fleet commanded by Sir
Charles Wager. He arrived at Gibraltar in the begin∣ning
of April, where he landed the troops, with a great
quantity of ammunition, warlike stores, and four-and-twenty
pieces of cannon. At the same time, five hundred
men arrived from Minorca; so that the garrison amounted
to six thousand, plentifully supplied with fresh provisions
from the coast of Barbary, and treated the efforts of the
besiegers with great contempt. The States-General, be∣ing
apprehensive of an attempt upon their barrier in the
Netherlands, desired the King would hold in readiness
the ten thousand auxiliaries stipulated in the treaty. These
were immediately prepared for embarkation, and the forces
of England were augmented with thirty new-raised com∣panies.
Sir John Norris set sail with a powerful fleet for
the Baltick, and was joined by a Danish squadron; but
the Czarina dying on the seventeenth day of May, he had
no occasion to commit hostilities, as the Russian armament
was laid aside.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. Mean while the powers at variance, though
extremely irritated against each other, were all equally
averse to a war that might again embroil all Europe.
The King of France interposed his mediation, which
was conducted by the Duke de Richlieu, his ambassador
at Vienna. Plans and counterplans of pacification were
proposed between the two crowns and the allies. At
length all parties agreed to twelve preliminary articles,
which were signed in May at Paris, by the ministers of
the Hanover alliance, and afterwards at Vienna, by the
Imperial and Spanish ambassadors. These imported that
hostilities should immediately cease: that the charter of
the Ostend company should be suspended for seven years;
and that a congress should in four months be opened at
Aix-la-Chapelle, for adjusting all differences, and con∣solidating
<PB N="422" REF="428"/>
solidating the peace of Europe. This congress was after∣wards
transferred to Soissons, for the conveniency of the
French minister, whose presence was necessary at court.
The siege of Gibraltar was raised, after it had lasted four
months, during which the Spaniards lost a great number
of men by sickness, while the garrison sustained very
little damage. The court of Madrid, however, started
some new difficulties and for some time would not con∣sent
to the restitution of the South-Sea ship, which had
been detained at La Vera Cruz, in the West-Indies; so
that Sir Charles Wager continued to cruise on the coast
of Spain; but these objections were removed in the sequel.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. King George, having appointed a re∣gency,
embarked at Greenwich, on the third day of June,
and landing in Holland on the seventh, set out on his
journey to Hanover. He was suddenly seised with a pa∣ralytick
disorder on the road; he forthwith lost the fa∣culty
of speech, became lethargick, and was conveyed in a
state of insensibility to Osnabruck. There he expired on
Sunday the eleventh day of June, in the sixty-eighth year
of his age; and in the thirteenth of his reign. George I.
was plain and simple in his person and address; grave and
composed in his deportment, though easy, familiar, and
facetious in his hours of relaxation. Before he ascended
the throne of Great-Britain, he had acquired the cha∣racter
of a circumspect general, a just and merciful prince,
a wise politician, who perfectly understood, and steadily
pursued his own interest. With these qualities, it cannot
be doubted but that he came to England extremely well
disposed to govern his new subjects according to the max∣ims
of the British constitution, and the genius of the peo∣ple;
and if ever he seemed to deviate from these princi∣ples,
we may take it for granted, that he was misled by the
venal suggestions of a ministry, whose power and influence
were founded on corruption<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>George I. married the Princess Sophia Dorothy, daughter and heiress of the Duke of Zell, by whom he had King George II. and the late Queen of Prussia. The King's body was conveyed to Hanover, and interred among his aucestors.</P>
<P><PB N="423" REF="429"/>
From the death of Charles II. to this period, England had made a con∣siderable figure in every branch of literature. Dr. Atterbury and Dr. Clarke distinguished themselves in divinity—Mr. Whiston wrote in defence of Arianism—John Locke shone forth the great restorer of human reason—the Earl of Shaftesbury raised an elegant, though feeble, system of moral philosophy—Berkeley, afterwards Bishop of Cloyne, in Ireland, surpassed all his contemporaries in subtlety and variety of metaphysical arguments, as well as in the art of deduction—Lord Bolingbroke's talents as a metaphysician, have been questioned since his posthumous works appeared—great progress was made in mathematicks and astronomy, by Wallis, Halley, and Flam∣stead—the art of medicine owed some valuable improvements to the classical Dr. Friend, and the elegant Dr. Mead. Among the poets of this aera we number John Philips, author of a didactick poem called Cyder, a performance of real merit; he lived and died in obscurity—William Congreve, cele∣brated for his comedies, which are not so famous for strength of character and power of humour, as for wit, elegance, and regularity—Vanburgh, who wrote with more nature and fire, though with less art and precision—Steele, who in his comedies successfully engrafted modern characters on the ancient drama—Farquhar, who drew his pictures from fancy, rather than from nature, and whose chief merit consists in the agreeable pertness and vivacity of his dialogue—Addison, whose fame as a poet greatly exceeded his genius, which was cold and enervate; though he yielded to none in the character of an essayist, either for style or matter—Swift, whose muse seems to have been mere misanthropy: he was a cynick rather than a poet, and his natural dryness and sarcastick severity would have been unpleasing, had not he qua∣lified them, by adopting the extravagant humour of Lucian and Rabelais—Prior, lively, familiar, and amusing—Rowe, solemn, florid, and declamatory—Pope, the prince of lyric poetry, unrivalled in satire, ethicks, and polished versification—the agreeable Parnel—the wild, the witty, and the whimsical Garth—Gay, whose fables may vie with those of La Fontaine, in native humour, ease, and simplicity; and whose genius for pastoral was truely original. Dr. Bentley stood foremost in the list of criticks and commentators. Sir Christopher Wren raised some noble monuments of architecture. The most remarkable political writers were Davenant, Hare, Swift, Steele, Addi∣son, Bolingbroke, and Trenchard.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<PB N="425" REF="431"/>
<P>§ I. AT the accession of George II. the nation had
great reason to wish for an alteration of mea∣sures.
The publick debt, notwithstanding the boasted
oeconomy and management of the ministers; notwith∣standing
the sinking fund, which had been extolled as a
growing treasure sacred to the discharge of national in∣cumbrances;
was now increased to fifty millions two
hundred sixty-one thousand two hundred and six pounds,
nineteen shillings, eight pence three farthings. The king∣dom
was bewildered in a labyrinth of treaties and con∣ventions,
by which it stood engaged in pecuniary sub∣sidies
to many powers upon the continent, with whom its
real interests could never be connected. The wealth of
the nation had been lavished upon these foreign con∣nexions;
upon unnecessary wars, and fruitless expeditions.
Dangerous encroachments had been made upon the con∣stitution,
by the repeal of the act for triennial parlia∣ments;
by frequent suspensions of the Habeas Corpus act
upon frivolous occasions; by repealing clauses in the act
of settlement; by votes of credit; by habituating the
people to a standing army; and, above all, by establishing
a system of corruption, which at all times would secure a
majority in parliament. The nature of prerogative, by
which the liberties of the nation had formerly been often
endangered, was now so well understood, and so securely
restrained, that it could no longer be used for the same
oppressive purposes; besides, an avowed extension of the
prerogative required more ability, courage, and resolution,
than the present ministry could exert. They understood
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir own strength, and had recourse to a more safe and
effectual expedient. The vice, luxury, and prostitution
of the age, the almost total extinction of sentiment, ho∣nour,
and public spirit, had prepared the minds of men
or slavery and corruption. The means were in the hands
<PB N="426" REF="432"/>
of the ministry; the publick treasure was at their devo∣tion;
they multiplied places and pensions, to increase the
number of their dependents: they squandered away the
money of the nation without taste, discernment, decency,
or remorse; they inlisted an army of the most abandoned
emissaries, whom they employed to vindicate the worst
measures, in the face of truth, common sense, and common
honesty; and they did not fail to stigmatize as Jacobites,
and enemies to the government, all those who presumed to
question the merit of their administration.</P>
<P>§ II. The supreme direction of affairs was not yet engros∣sed
by a single minister. Lord Townshend had the reputa∣tion
of conducting the external transactions relating to trea∣ties
and negociations. He is said to have understood that
province, though he did not always follow the dictates of
his own understanding. He possessed an extensive fund of
knowledge; and was well acquainted with the functions of
his office. The Duke of N. his colleague, was not remark∣able
for any of these qualifications; he owned his promotion
to his uncommon zeal for the illustrious house of Hanover,
and the strength of his interest in parliament, rather than to
his judgment, precision, or any other intellectual merit.
Lord C. who may be counted an auxiliary, though not im∣mediately
concerned in the administration, had distinguished
himself in the character of envoy at several courts in Europe.
He had attained an intimate knowledge of all the different
interests and connexions subsisting among the powers of
the continent; and he infinitely surpassed all the ministers
in learning and capacity. He was, indeed, the only man
of genius employed under this government. He spoke
with case and propriety; his conceptions were just and
lively; his inferences bold; his counsels vigorous and
warm. Yet he depreciated his talents, by acting in a sub∣ordinate
character to those whom he despised; and seemed
to look upon the pernicious measures of a bad ministry
with silent contempt, rather than with avowed detestation.
The interior government of Great-Britain was chiefly
<PB N="427" REF="433"/>
managed by Sir Robert W. a man of extraordinary talents,
who had from low beginnings raised himself to the head
of the Treasury. Having obtained a seat in the Lower
House, he declared himself one of the most forward par∣tisans
of the Whig faction. He was endued with a species
of eloquence, which, though neither nervous nor elegant,
flowed with great facility, and was so plausible on all sub∣jects,
that even when he misrepresented the truth, whether
from ignorance or design, he seldom failed to persuade that
part of his audience for whose hearing his harangue was
chiefly intended. He was well acquainted with the nature
of the public funds, and understood the whole mystery of
stock-jobbing. This knowledge procured a connexion be∣tween
him and the money-corporations, which served to
enhance his importance. He perceived the bulk of man∣kind
were actuated by a sordid thirst of lucre; he had sa∣gacity
enough to convert the degeneracy of the times to
his own advantage; and on this, and this alone, he found∣ed
the whole superstructure of his subsequent administra∣tion.
In the late reign he had, by dint of speaking deci∣sively
to every question, by boldly impeaching the conduct
of the Tory ministers, by his activity in elections, and en∣gaging
as a projector in the schemes of the monied-interest,
become a leading member in the House of Commons. By
his sufferings under the Tory parliament, he attained the
rank of a martyr to his party; his interest, his reputation,
and his presumption daily increased; he opposed Sunder∣land
as his rival in power, and headed a dangerous defec∣tion
from the ministry, which evinced the greatness of his
influence and authority. He had the glory of being prin∣cipally
concerned in effecting a reconciliation between
the late King and the Prince of Wales; then he was re∣associated
in the administration with additional credit;
and, from the death of the Earls of Sunderland and Stan∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ope,
he had been making long strides towards the office
of prime-minister. He knew the maxims he had adopted
would subject him to the hatred, the ridicule, and reproach
<PB N="428" REF="434"/>
of some individuals, who had not yet resigned all senti∣ments
of patriotism, nor all views of opposition; but the
number of these was inconsiderable, when compared to
that which constituted the body of the community; and
he would not suffer the consideration of such antagonists
to come in competition with his schemes of power, afflu∣ence,
and authority. Nevertheless, low as he had hum∣bled
antiministerial association, it required all his artifice
to elude, all his patience and natural phlegm to bear the
powerful arguments that were urged, and the keen satire
that was exercised against his measures and management,
by a few members in the opposition. Sir William Wynd∣ham
possessed all the energy of elocution; Mr. Shippen
was calm, intrepid, shrewd, and sarcastic; Mr. Hunger∣ford,
sly, insinuating, and ironical. Mr. W. P. inherited
from nature a good understanding, which he had studiously
cultivated. He was one of the most learned members in
the House of Commons, extremely well qualified to judge
of literary productions; well read in history and poli∣ticks;
deeply skilled in the British constitution, the detail
of government, and the nature of the finances. He spoke
with freedom, fluency, and uncommon warmth of decla∣mation,
which was said to be the effect of personal ani∣mosity
to Sir R. W. with whom he had been formerly
connected.</P>
<P>§ III. An express arriving on the fourteenth day of
June, with an account of the King's death, his late
Majesty King George II. repaired from Richmond, where
he received this intelligence, to Leicester-House; and the
members of the privy-council being assembled, were sworn
a-new. The King declared his firm purpose to preserve
the constitution in church and state, and to cultivate
those alliances which his father had made with foreign
princes. At the same time, he took and subscribed the
oath for the security of the church of Scotland, as required
by the act of Union. Next day he was proclaimed King
of Great-Britain. The parliament assembled in pursuance
of the act made for that purpose; but was immediately
<PB N="429" REF="435"/>
prorogued by commission to the twenty-seventh day of the
month. All the great officers of state continued in their
places: Sir Robert Walpole kept possession of the Trea∣sury;
and the system of politicks which the late king
had established underwent no sort of alteration. The
King, in his speech to both Houses at the opening of the
session, professed a fixed resolution to merit the love and
affection of his people, by maintaining them in the full
enjoyment of their religious and civil rights. He pro∣mised
to lessen the publick expense as soon as the circum∣stances
of affairs would permit: he observed to the Com∣mons,
that the grant of the greatest part of the civil-list
revenues was now determined; and that it would be ne∣cessary
for them to make a new provision for the support
of him and his family: lastly, he recommended it to both
Houses to dispatch the business that should be necessarily
brought before them, as the season of the year and the
circumstances of time required their presence in the coun∣try.
Addresses of condolance and congratulation being
drawn up and presented, the Commons, in a committee of
the whole House, took into consideration a motion for a
supply to his Majesty. Sir Robert Walpole having ob∣served
that the annual sum of seven hundred thousand
pounds granted to, and settled on the late King, had
fallen short every year; and that his present Majesty's
expenses were likely to increase, by reason of the largeness
of his family, moved that the entire revenues of the civil∣list,
which produced about eight hundred thousand pounds
per annum, should be settled on the King during his life.
Mr. Shippen opposed this motion, as inconsistent with the
trust reposed in them as representatives of the people, who
ought to be very frugal in exercising the right of giving
away the publick money. He said the sum of seven
hundred thousand pounds was not obtained for his late
Majesty without a long and solemn debate; and every
member who contended for it at that time allowed it to
be an ample royal revenue: that, although his Majesty's
family should be enlarged, a circumstance which had been
<PB N="430" REF="436"/>
urged as one reason for the motion, he presumed the ap∣pointments
of Prince Frederick would be much inferior
to those settled on his present Majesty when he was Prince
of Wales: besides, it was to be hoped that many personal,
many particular expenses in the late reign, especially those
for frequent journies to Hanover, would be discontinued,
and entirely cease. He observed that the civil-list branches
in the Queen's reign did not often exceed the sum of five
hundred and fifty thousand pounds; nevertheless, she
called upon her parliament but once, in a reign of thirteen
years, to pay the debts contracted in her civil govern∣ment;
and these were occasioned by the unparalleled in∣stances
of her piety and generosity. She gave the first∣fruits
and tenths, arising to nineteen thousand pounds
a-year, as an augmentation of the maintenance of the poor
clergy. She bestowed five thousand pounds per annum,
out of the Post-office, on the Duke of Marlborough: she
suffered seven hundred pounds to be charged weekly on
the same office, for the service of the publick: she ex∣pended
several hundred thousand pounds in building the
castle of Blenheim: she allowed four thousand pounds
annually to Prince Charles of Denmark: she sustained
great losses by the tin contract: she supported the poor
Palatines: she exhibited many other proofs of royal boun∣ty;
and immediately before her death she had formed a
plan of retrenchment, which would have reduced her
yearly expenses to four hundred and fifty-nine thousand
nine hundred and forty-one pounds. He affirmed that a
million a-year would not be sufficient to carry on the
exorbitant expenses, so often and so justly complained of
in the House of Commons: that over and above the
yearly allowance of seven hundred thousand pounds, many
occasional taxes, many excessive sums were raised, and all
sunk in the bottomless gulf of secret service. Two
hundred and fifty thousand pounds were raised in defiance
of the ancient parliamentary methods, to secure the king∣dom
from a Swedish invasion: then the two insurance
offices were erected, and paid near three hundred thousand
<PB N="431" REF="437"/>
pounds for their charters: our enmity with Sweden being
changed into alliance, a subsidy of seventy-two thousand
pounds was implicitly granted, to fulfil some secret engage∣ment
with that crown: four-and-twenty thousand pounds
were given for burning merchant ships arrived from in∣fected
places, though the goods, which ought to have been
destroyed for the publick safety, were afterwards privately
sold a sum of five hundred thousand pounds was de∣manded,
and granted, for paying the debts of the civil∣list;
and his Majesty declared, by message, he was re∣solved
to retrench his expenses for the future. Notwith∣standing
this resolution, in less than four years, a new
demand of the like sum was made and granted, to discharge
new incumbrances: the Spanish ships of war which Ad∣miral
Byng took in the Mediterranean were sold for a
considerable sum of money; one hundred and twenty-five
thousand pounds were granted in the last session, to be
secretly disposed of for the publick utility; and there was
still a debt in the civil government, amounting to above six
hundred thousand pounds. He took notice, that this
amazing extravagance happened under the conduct of
persons pretending to surpass all their predecessors in the
knowledge and care of the publick revenue; that as none
of these sums had been accounted for, they were, in all
probability, employed in services not fit to be owned.
He said, he heartily wished that time, the great discoverer
of hidden truths, and concealed iniquities, might produce
a list of all such as had been perverted from their publick
duty by private pensions; who had been the hired slaves
and the corrupt instruments of a profuse and vain-glorious
administration. He proposed, that, instead of granting an
addition to the civil-list, they should restrict that revenue
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a certain sum, by concluding the question with these
words, startq;in like manner as they were granted and con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tinued
to his late Majesty, so as to make up the clear
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> yearly sum of seven hundred thousand pounds.” To
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ese particulars, which were indeed unanswerable, no
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ply was made. Even this mark of decency was laid
<PB N="432" REF="438"/>
aside, as idle and superfluous. The House agreed to the
motion; and a bill was brought in for the better support
of his Majesty's household. The Commons having re∣ceived
a message from the King, desiring they would make
further provision for the Queen his confort, resolved, That
in case she should survive his Majesty, the sum of one
hundred thousand pounds should be settled upon her for
life, charged upon the revenues of the civil-list, together
with his Majesty's palace of Somerset-House, and Rich∣mond
Old Park. A bill was formed on this resolution,
which, as well as the other, passed both Houses: and re∣ceived
the royal assent on the seventeenth day of July,
when the King, in a speech to both Houses, expressed
his satisfaction with their conduct; and congratulated
them upon the wealth and glory of the nation, by which
they had acquired such weight in holding the balance of
Europe. Then the Lord-Chancellor prorogued the parlia∣ment
to the twenty-ninth day of August; but on the
seventh of that month a proclamation was issued for dissolv∣ing
this, and convoking another.</P>
<P>§ IV. In the interim some changes were made in differ∣ent
departments of civil oeconomy. Lord Viscount Tor∣rington
was placed at the head of the Admiralty: the Earl
of Westmorland was appointed first lord-commissioner
of trade and plantations. Philip Dormer Stanhope, Earl
of Chesterfield, a nobleman remarkable for his wit, elo∣quence,
and polished manners, was nominated ambassador
to the Hague. The privy-council being dissolved, another
was appointed of the members then present. The Duke
of Devonshire was dignified with the place of president;
and the Duke of St. Alban's was appointed master of the
horse. On the eleventh day of October the coronation of
the King and Queen was performed at Westminister-Abbey,
with the usual solemnity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">King George. II. ascended the throne in the forty-fourth year of his age. On the second day of September, 1705, he espoused the Princess Wilhelmina Charlo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Caroline, daughter to John Frederick Marquis of Brandenburgh-Anspach, by whom he had two sons, Frederick Louis Prince of Wales, born at Hanover, on the thirty-first day of January, 1707, and William Augustus, born at London, on the fifteenth day of April, 1721. She had likewise bor'n four princesses, namely, Anne, Amelia, Carolina, Mary, and was afterwards delivered of Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isa, married in the sequel to th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> King of Denmark.</NOTE>. By this time the
<PB N="433" REF="439"/>
courts of France and Spain were perfectly reconciled: all
Europe was freed from the calamities of war; and the
peace of Great-Britain suffered no interruption, except from
some transient tumults among the tinners of Cornwall,
who, being provoked by a scarcity of corn, rose in arms,
and plundered the granaries of that county.</P>
<P>§ V. The elections in England and Scotland for the par∣liament
having succeeded on the new system, according
to the wishes of the ministry, the two Houses met on the
twenty-third day of January, when the Commons unani∣mously
chose for their Speaker Arthur Onslow, Esquire,
knight of the shire for Surrey, a gentleman of extensive
knowledge, worth, and probity, grave, eloquent, vene∣rable,
and every way qualified for the discharge of that
honourable and important office. The King, in his speech
to this new parliament, declared, that, by the last ad∣vices
from abroad, he had reason to hope the difficulties
which had hitherto retarded the execution of the prelimi∣naries,
and the opening of the congress, would soon be
entirely removeds in the mean time, he represented the
absolute necessity of continuing the preparations which
had hitherto secured the nation, and prevented an open
rupture in Europe. He promised, that his first care should
be to reduce from time to time the expense of the publick,
as often, and as soon as the interest and safety of his people
would permit such reduction. He expressed an earnest
desire of seeing the foundation laid of an effectual scheme
for the increase and encouragement of seamen in general,
that they might be invited rather than compelled into the
service of their country. Finally, he recommended una∣nimity,
zeal, and dispatch of the publick business. Those
speeches, penned by the minister, were composed with a
view to soothe the minds of the people into an immediate
<PB N="434" REF="440"/>
concurrence with the measures of the government; but
without any intention of performing those promises of
oeconomy, reformation, and national advantage. The
two Houses seemed to vie with each other in expressions
of applause and affection to his Majesty. The Lords, in
their address, hailed him as the best of kings, and true
father of his country. The Commons expressed the warm∣est
sense of gratitude for the blessings they enjoyed in
his reign, though it was not yet eight months old. They
approved of all his transactions; promised to support him
in all his undertakings; and declared they would chear∣fully
grant whatever supplies should be wanted for the
publick service. Having considered the estimates which
were laid before them by order of his Majesty, they voted
two-and-twenty thousand nine hundred and fifty-five men
for guards and garrisons; and fifteen thousand seamen for
the service of the ensuing year. They granted two hun∣dred
and thirty thousand nine hundred and twenty-three
pounds, for the maintenance of twelve thousand Hessian
troops; a subsidy of fifty thousand pounds to the King of
Sweden; and half that sum to the Duke of Brunswick
Wolfenbuttel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nothing could be a greater b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>sque upon negociation than this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of alliance concluded with the petty Duke of We<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>enbuttel, who very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> guarantees to his Britannick Majesty the possession of his three <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and oblige<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> himself to supply his Majesty with five thousand men, in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ation of an annual subsidy of five-and-twenty thousand pounds for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE>. The expense of the year amounted to four
millions, raised by a land-tax of three shillings in the
pound, a malt-tax, and by borrowing of the Bank one
million seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds; for
which annuities to the amount of seventy thousand pounds,
to be raised by duties on coals imported into the city of
London, were granted to that corporation.</P>
<P>§ VI. All these sums, however, were not granted with∣out
question. The number of land-forces occasioned
a debate; and the Hessian auxiliaries were not allowed
without dispute and opposition. When they deliberated
on the loan of the Bank, Mr. W. Pultency observed, that
the shifting of funds was but perpetuating taxes, and putting
<PB N="435" REF="441"/>
off the evil day; that notwithstanding the great merit
which some persons had built on the sinking fund, it ap∣peared
that the national debt had been increased since the
setting up that pompous project. Some warm altercation
passed between him and Sir Robert Walpole on this subject.
The lord-mayor, aldermen, and common-council of Lon∣don
presented a petition, setting forth, that the duties al∣ready
laid upon coals and culm imported into London
affected the trade of that city only; that the inequality of the
burthen was a great discouragement to their manufactures,
and an hardship upon all the trading inhabitants. The
petition was rejected, and the tax imposed. The House
having addressed the King for a particular and distinct ac∣count
of the distribution of two hundred and fifty thou∣sand
pounds, charged to have been issued for securing the
trade and navigation of the kingdom, and preserving and re∣storing
the peace of Europe, he declined granting their
request, but signified in general, that part of the money
had been issued and disbursed by his late Majesty, and the
remainder by himself, for carrying on the same necessary
services, which required the greatest secresy. Such a
message in the reign of King William would have raised
a dangerous flame in the House of Commons.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1728.</NOTE> Mr. W.
Pulteney inveighed against such a vague and general way
of accounting for the publick money, as tending to render
parliaments altogether insignificant, to cover embezzle∣ments,
and to screen corrupt and rapacious ministers.
The Commons having taken into consideration the state
of the national debt, examined the accounts, and interro∣gated
the proper officers. A motion was made by a court
member, that it appeared the monies already issued and
applied towards discharging the national debts, together
with a sum to be issued at Lady-day, amounted to six
millions six hundred forty-eight thousand seven hundred
and sixty-two pounds, five shillings, one penny, one
farthing. In vain did the leaders of opposition expose
the fallacious tendency of this motion. In vain did they
demonstrate the fraudulent artifice used in drawing up the
<PB N="436" REF="442"/>
accounts:<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1728.</NOTE> the motion was carried; and several resolutions
were taken on the state of the national debts. In the
particular account of these debts, upon which the House
resolved to form a representation to his Majesty, an article
of three hundred thousand pounds relating to the duty
upon wrought plate was totally omitted. This extraordi∣nary
omission being discovered, gave rise to a very warm
debate, and to very severe reflexions against those who
superintended the publick accounts. This error being rec∣tified,
a committee appointed for the purpose drew up
the representation, containing a particular detail of the
national debts discharged and incurred since the twenty-fifth
day of December, in the year one thousand seven
hundred and sixteen, with a state of the sinking fund and
of the publick credit. The draft being approved by
the House, was presented to the King, who received it
graciously. He took this opportunity of saying, that the
provision made for gradually discharging the national debt
was now become so certain and considerable, that nothing
but some unforeseen event could alter or diminish it: a
circumstance that afforded the fairest prospect of seeing the
old debts discharged, without any necessity of incurring
new incumbrances.</P>
<P>§ VII. This answer, fraught with many other expres∣sions
of fatherly tenderness for his people, paved the way
for a message to the House, demanding a vote of credit to
fulfil certain engagements entered into, and concerted with
the advice and concurrence of the last parliament, for
securing the trade and navigation of the kingdom, and
for restoring and preserving the peace of Europe. Though
a debate ensued upon this message, the majority resolved
that an address should be presented to his Majesty, de∣claring
the duty and fidelity of the Commons, their entire
confidence in his royal care and goodness, and their readi∣ness
to enable his Majesty to fulfil his engagements. A
vote of credit passed accordingly. During this session,
the peers were chiefly employed in examining copies of
several treaties and alliances which the King submitted to
<PB N="437" REF="443"/>
their perusal;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IV. 1728.</NOTE> they likewise prepared a bill for amending
the statute of limitation, which, however, did not pass into
a law: they considered the state of the national debt; a
subject fruitful of debates: they passed the mutiny-bill,
and those that were sent up from the Commons, touching
the supplies; together with an act, obliging ships arriving
from infected places to perform quarantine; and some
others of a more private nature. These bills having re∣ceived
the royal assent, the King closed the session on the
twenty-eighth day of May, when he thanked the Commons
for the effectual supplies they had raised, and in particular,
for having empowered him to borrow five hundred thou∣sand
pounds for the discharge of wages due to the seamen
employed in the navy.</P>
<P>§ VIII. England was at this period quite barren of re∣markable
events. The King's uncle, Ernest Augustus,
Prince of Brunswick, Duke of York, and Bishop of
Osnabruck, died on the third day of August, and was
succeeded in the bishoprick by the Elector of Cologn,
according to the pactum by which Osnabruck is alter∣nately
possessed by the house of Brunswick and that
Elector. In the beginning of December, his Majesty's
eldest son Prince Frederick arrived in England from Hano∣ver,
where he had hitherto resided, was introduced into
the privy-council, and created Prince of Wales. Signior
Como, resident from the Duke of Parma, was ordered to
quit the kingdom, because his master paid to the Pretender
the honours due to the King of Great-Britain. The
congress opened at Soissons, for determining all disputes
among the powers of Europe, proved ineffectual. Such
difficulties occurred in settling and reconciling so many
different pretensions and interests, that the contracting
parties in the alliance of Hanover proposed a provisional
treaty, concerning which no definitive answer was given
as yet by the courts of Vienna and Madrid. The fate of
Europe, therefore, continued in suspense: the English
fleet lay inactive and rotting in the West-Indies: the
sailors perished miserably, without daring to avenge their
<PB N="438" REF="444"/>
country's wrongs; while the Spanish cruisers committed
depredations with impunity on the commerce of Great-Britain.
The court of Spain, at this juncture, seemed
cold and indifferent with regard to a pacification with Eng∣land.
It had renewed a good understanding with France,
and now strengthened its interest by a double alliance of
marriage with the royal family of Portugal. The Infanta
of this house was betrothed to the Prince of Asturias:
while the Spanish Infanta, formerly affianced to the French
King, was now matched with the Prince of Brasil, eldest
son of his Portuguese Majesty. In the month of Janu∣ary,
the two courts met in a wooden house built over the
little river Coya, that separates the two kingdoms, and
there the princesses were exchanged.</P>
<P>§ IX. The parliament of Great-Britain meeting accord∣ing
to their last prorogation on the twenty-first day of
January, the King in his speech communicated the nature
of the negociation at the congress. He demanded such
supplies as might enable him to act vigorously in concert
with his allies, provided his endeavours to establish an ad∣vantageous
peace should miscarry: and he hinted, that the
dilatory conduct of the courts of Vienna and Madrid pro∣ceeded
in a great measure from the hopes that were given,
of creating discontents and divisions among the subjects
of Great-Britain. This suggestion was a ministerial arti∣fice
to inflame the zeal and resentment of the nation, and
intimidate the members in the opposition. Accord∣ingly
the hint was pursued, and in the addresses from
both Houses, that could not fail of being agreeable, con∣sidering
the manner in which they were dictated, particu∣lar
notice was taken of this article: both Peers and Com∣mons
expressed their detestation and abhorrence of those,
who, by such base and unnatural artifices, suggested the
means of distressing their country, and clamoured at the
inconveniencies which they themselves had occasioned.
In these addresses, likewise, the parliament congratulated
his Majesty on the arrival of the Prince of Wales in his
British dominions; and the Commons sent a particular
<PB N="439" REF="445"/>
compliment to his royal highness on that occasion. The
estimates having been examined in the usual form, the
House voted fifteen thousand seamen for the ensuing year:
but the motion for continuing the same number of land∣forces
which had been allowed in the preceding year, was
not carried without dispute. All the arguments against a
standing army in time of peace, as inconsistent with the
British constitution, and dangerous to the liberties of the
people, were repeated with great vivacity by Mr. Shippen
and Mr. W. Pulteney. These, however, were answered,
and represented as absurd, by Mr. Horatio Walpole and
Mr. D. two staunch adherents of the minister. The first
had, in despite of nature, been employed in different ne∣gociations:
he was blunt, aukward, and slovenly: an orator
without eloquence, an ambassador without dignity, and a
plenipotentiary without address. The other had natural
parts and acquired knowledge; spoke with confidence; and
in dispute was vain, sarcastick, petulant, and verbose.</P>
<P>§ X. The subsidies to Sweden, Hesse-Cassel, and Wol∣fenbuttel
were continued, notwithstanding the remon∣strances
of Sir Joseph Jekyll, Mr. Lutwyche, and Mr.
Pulteney; which last observed, that as the Landgrave of
Hesse-Cassel, and the Duke of Brunswick Wolfenbuttel,
usually maintained a certain number of troops in their
pay, it was but reasonable that Great-Britain should de∣fray
no more than the expense of the additional forces
which those powers had raised, in consequence of their
conventions with the King of England. Sir Robert
Walpole perceiving that this remark made an impression
on the House, thought it necessary to vindicate his mea∣sure:
he expatiated upon the wisdom of the late King, in
concluding the Hanover alliance. He affirmed that the
convention with Hesse-Cassel had prevented a war in the
empire, for which the court of Vienna had made great
preparations: that the Emperor had not only augmented
his own forces by the help of Spanish subsidies, but also
retained the troops of three electors; and if he had not
<PB N="440" REF="446"/>
been over-awed by the Hessians, would certainly have re∣jected
the preliminaries, and all other advances towards a
pacification: that, therefore, they ought not to grudge an
expense which had already proved so beneficial to the tran∣quillity
of Europe. Sir Joseph Jekyll replied, that what∣ever
gloss might be put upon such measures, they were re∣pugnant
to the maxims by which England in former times
had steered and squared its conduct with relation to its
interest abroad: that the navy was the natural strength of
Great-Britain—its best defence and security: but if, in or∣der
to avoid a war, they should be so free-hearted as to buy
and maintain the forces of foreign princes, they were ne∣ver
like to see an end of such extravagant expenses.
This gentleman, who exercised the office of master of the
Rolls, had approved himself a zealous defender of Whig
principles, was an able lawyer, a sensible speaker, and a
conscientious patriot. The supplies were raised by a con∣tinuation
of the land-tax, the duties upon malt, cyder, and
perry, an additional imposition on unmalted corn used in
distilling, and by sale of annuities to the Bank not exceed∣ing
fifty thousand pounds per annum.</P>
<P>§ XI. Petitions were delivered to the House of Commons
from the merchants of London, Liverpool, and Bristol,
complaining of the interruptions they had suffered in their
trade for several years, by the depredations of the Spaniards
in the West-Indies. These being considered, the House
ordered the lords of the Admiralty to produce the other
memorials of the same kind which they had received, that
they might be laid before the congress at Soissons: then
they addressed his Majesty for copies of all the letters and
instructions which had been sent to Admiral Hosier, and
those who succeeded him in the command of the West-India
squadron. Mr. Oglethorpe having been informed
of shocking cruelties and oppressions exercised by gaolers
upon their prisoners, moved for an examination into these
practices, and was chosen chairman of a committee ap∣pointed
to enquire into the state of the goals of the king∣dom.
They began with the Fleet-prison, which they
<PB N="441" REF="447"/>
visited in a body: there they found Sir William Rich, Ba∣ronet,
loaded with irons, by order of Bambridge the war∣den,
to whom he had given some slight cause of offence.
They made a discovery of many inhuman barbarities, which
had been committed by that ruffian, and detected the most
iniquitous scenes of fraud, villainy, and extortion. When
the report was made by the committee, the House unani∣mously
resolved, that Thomas Bambridge, acting warden
of the Fleet, had wilfully permitted several debtors to
escape; had been guilty of the most notorious breaches of
trust, great extortions, and the highest crimes and misde∣meanours
in the execution of his office; that he had arbi∣trarily
and unlawfully loaded with irons, put into dun∣geons,
and destroyed prisoners for debt, under his charge,
treating them in the most barbarous and cruel manner, in
high violation and contempt of the laws of the kingdom.
John Huggins, Esquire, who had been warden of the Fleet∣prison,
was subjected to a resolution of the same nature.
The House presented an address to the King, desiring he
would direct his attorney-general forthwith to prosecute
these persons and their accomplices, who were committed
prisoners to Newgate. A bill was brought in, disabling
Bambridge to execute the office of warden; another for
the better regulating the prison of the Fleet; and for more
effectually preventing and punishing arbitrary and illegal
practices of the warden of the said prison<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It afterwards appeared that some of the members of this inquest were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lu∣ated by other motives than those they professed; and the committee was suf∣fered to sink into oblivion.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>§ XII. Other merchants complained by petition of the
losses sustained by the Spaniards. The House, in a grand
committee, deliberated on this subject, enquired into the
particulars, examined evidence, and drew up an address to
the King, desiring his Majesty would be graciously pleased
to use his utmost endeavours for preventing such depre∣dations:
for procuring just and reasonable satisfaction;
and for securing to his subjects the free exercise of com∣merce
and navigation to and from the British colonies in
<PB N="442" REF="448"/>
America. The King answered them he would use his best
endeavours to answer the desires and expectations of his
people, in an affair of so much importance; and they, in
another address, thanked him for his gracious answer.
They did not, however, receive such a satisfactory reply
to a former address, touching the sum of sixty thousand
pounds that had been stated in the publick account, with∣out
specification of the particular uses to which it was ap∣plied.
His Majesty gave them to understand that the mo∣ney
had been issued and disbursed for secret services; and
that a distinct and particular acconnt of the distribution
of it could not be given without a manifest prejudice to
the publick. A bill was prepared for the more effectual
preventing bribery and corruption in elections for members
of parliament; and it passed through the House without
opposition; but their attention was chiefly employed upon
the Spanish depredations, which had raised a great clamour
through the whole kingdom, and excited very warm dis∣putes
in parliament; for they were generally reputed the
fruits of negligence, incapacity, or want of vigour in the
ministers. The Commons having made further progress
in the enquiry, and received fresh petitions from the mer∣chants,
passed some resolutions, in which the Spaniards
were accused of having violated the treaties subsisting be∣tween
the two crowns; and with having treated inhumanly
the masters and crews of ships belonging to Great-Britain.
They justified the instructions given to Admiral Hosier, to
seise and detain the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ota and galleons of Spain, until justice
and satisfaction should be rendered to his Majesty and his
allies; nay, even declared that such seisure would have been
just, prudent, and necessary, tending to prevent an open
rupture, and to preserve the peace and tranquillity of Eu∣rope.
They again addressed the King to use his endeavours
to procure satisfaction; and he promised to comply
with their request.</P>
<P>§ XIII. Mr. Scroope, member for Bristol, moved for
an address, entreating his Majesty to order an account of
the produce of the civil-list revenues for one year to be
<PB N="443" REF="449"/>
laid before the House. The address was presented, the
account produced, and the House, in a grand committee,
took this affair into consideration. The courtiers affirmed
that they fell short of the eight hundred thousand pounds
settled upon his Majesty; and Mr. Scroope proposed that
the sum of one hundred and fifteen thousand pounds should
be granted to the King, on account of those deficiencies
and arrears. The motion was vigorously opposed by Mr.
Pulteney and other members. They expressed their sur∣prise
that it should be made so late in the session, when
no further demand of money could be reasonably expected;
and they said it was the more extraordinary, because it ap∣peared
in the former session, from the examination of the
accounts then before the House, that the revenues of the
civil-list produced yearly a much greater sum than that for
which they were given. Mr. Pulteney moved that the ac∣counts
and papers should be referred to the examination of
a select committee, properly empowered to investigate the
truth. The ministers opposed this motion; and the ques∣tion
being put, it passed in the negative. The majority
voted the sum demanded; and in a bill for settling the
price of imported corn, they inserted the resolution for
granting to his Majesty the sum of one hundred and fifteen
thousand pounds, on account of arrears due on the civil∣list
revenues.</P>
<P>§ XIV. The House of Lords having prepared a bill for
the more effectual punishment of forgery, which was passed
into a law, and ordered the judges to bring in another,
on the report of a committee appointed to consider the case
of imprisoned debtors, at length deliberated upon the state
of the nation, particularly the positive demand made by
the court of Spain for the restitution of Gibraltar, grounded
on a letter written by the late king to his Catholick Ma∣jesty.
From a copy of the letter laid before the House, it
plainly appeared that King George I. had consented to
this restitution. A motion being made for a resolution,
importing, that for the honour of his Majesty, and the
preservation and security of the trade and commerce of
<PB N="444" REF="450"/>
the kingdom, effectual care should be taken in the present
treaty that the King of Spain should renounce all claim
and pretension to Gibraltar and Minorca, in plain and
strong terms, a debate ensued, and the question being, put,
passed in the negative, though not without a protest. Then
the majority, resolved, that the House did entirely rely upon
his Majesty, that he would, for maintaining the honour
and securing the trade of this kingdom, take effectual care
in the present treaty to preserve his undoubted right to
Gibraltar and Minorca. When the House examined the
papers relating to the Spanish depredations, many severe
reflexions were uttered against the conduct of the ministry;
and a motion was made, to resolve that Hosier's expedition
was an unreasonable burthen on the nation: but this too
was rejected, and occasioned another protest. Nor did the
clause in the corn-bill, for granting one hundred and
fifteen thousand pounds to his Majesty, pass through the
House of Peers without warm opposition. Divers lords
alledged, that, instead of a deficiency in the civil-list reve∣nues,
there was a considerable surplus: that this was a
new grant, and a new burthen on the people: that the
nation was loaded, not to complete, but to augment the
sum designed for the civil-list; and this at a time when
the publick debts were increased; when the taxes were
heavily felt in all parts of the country; when the foreign
trade of Britain was incumbered and diminished; when
her manufactures were decayed; her poor multiplied; and
she was surrounded by many other national calamities.
They observed, that if the produce of the civil-list revenue
should not amount to the yearly sum of eight hundred
thousand pounds, the deficiency must be made good to
his Majesty by the publick; whereas no provision was
made, by which, if the produce of these revennes should
exceed that sum, the surplus could accrue to the benefit
of the public: that, by this precedent, not only real de∣ficiencies
were to be made good, but also supplies were to
be given for arrears standing out at the end of every
year, which should come on before the supplies could be
<PB N="445" REF="451"/>
granted, though the supply given to make good arrears in
one year would certainly increase the surplusages in an∣other:
that the revenues of the civil-list were variable in
their own nature; and even when there is a deficiency
in the produce, there might be arrears in the receipt:
these might be easily increased by the management of de∣signing
ministers, by private directions to receivers, and
by artful methods of stating accounts. All these argu∣ments,
and other objections equally strong and plausible,
against this unconscionable and unparliamentary motion,
served only to evince the triumph of the ministry over
shame and sentiment, their contempt of public spirit, and
their defiance of national reproach.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The peers that distinguished themselves in the opposition were Beaufort, Strafford, Craven, Foley, Lichfield, Scarsdale, Gower, Mountjoy, Plymouth, Bathurst, Northampton, Coventry, Oxford and Mortimer, Willoughby de Broke, Boyle, and Warrington.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>§ XV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1729.</NOTE> The King had, on the twenty-fourth day of
March, given the royal assent to five bills; and on the
fourteenth day of May, the same sanction was given to
thirty other bills, including an act, enabling the Queen
to be regent in the kingdom during his Majesty's absence,
without taking the oaths; and another for the relief of
insolvent debtors. At the same time two-and-thirty pri∣vate
bills were passed: then the King expressed his ap∣probation
of the parliament, signified his intention to
visit his German dominions, and ordered the Chancellor
to prorogue both Houses. His Majesty having appointed
the Queen regent of the realm, set out for Hanover, on
the seventeenth day of May, in order to remove a petty
misunderstanding which had happened between that elec∣torate
and the court of Berlin. Some Hanoverian subjects
had been pressed or decoyed into the service of Prussia;
and the regents of Hanover had seised certain Prussian
officers, by way of reprisal. The whole united kingdom
of Great-Britain at this juncture enjoyed uninterrupted
repose; and commerce continued to increase, in spite of
all restriction and discouragement. The people of Ireland
found themselves happy under the government of Lord
<PB N="446" REF="452"/>
Carteret;<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1729.</NOTE> and their parliament, assembling in the month
of September, approved themselves the fathers of their
country. They established funds for the discharge of their
national debt, and for maintaining the expense of govern∣ment:
they enacted wholesome laws for the encourage∣ment
of manufactures, trade, and agriculture; and they
formed wise regulations in different branches of civil
oeconomy. Some time after this session, which was con∣ducted
with so much harmony and patriotism, Lord Car∣teret
returned to England; and was succeeded by the
Duke of Dorset in the government of that kingdom. In
the month of May, Charles Lord Townshend resigned the
seals, which were given to Colonel Standhope, now created
Earl of Harrington; so that Sir R. W. now reigned
without a rival. James Earl of Waldegrave was appointed
ambassador to the court of France, which, about that time,
was filled with joy by the birth of a dauphin.</P>
<P>§ XVI. In the month of September, Victor Amadeus,
King of Sardinia, resigned his crown to his son Charles
Emanuel, Prince of Piedmont. The father reserved to
himself a revenue of one hundred thousand pistoles per
annum, retired to the castle of Chamberry, and espoused
the Countess Dowager of St. Sebastian, who declined the
title of queen, but assumed that of Marchioness of So∣merive.
Though the congress at Soissons proved abor∣tive,
conferences were begun at Seville, between the ple∣nipotentiaries
of England, France, and Spain; and a
treaty was concluded on the ninth day of November, not
only without the concurrence of the Emperor, but even
contrary to his right, as established by the quadruple al∣liance.
On this subject he communicated an imperial
commissorial decree to the states of the empire assembled in
the diet at Ratisbon, which was answered by the French
minister De Chavigny. In October Peter II. Czar of
Muscovy, and grandson of Peter I. died in the fifteenth
year of his age, at Moscow, and was succeeded on the
Russian throne by the Princess Anne Ivanowna, second
daughter of John Alexowitz, elder brother of the first
<PB N="447" REF="453"/>
Peter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IV. 1729.</NOTE> and widow of Frederick William Duke of Cour∣land.
The following month was rendered remarkable by
the death of Pope Benedict XIII. in whose room Cardinal
Laurence Corsini was raised to the pontificate, and assumed
the name of Clement XII.</P>
<P>§ XVII. The British parliament assembling on the
thirteenth day of January, the King gave them to under∣stand,
that the peace of Europe was now established by the
treaty of Seville, built upon the foundation of former
treaties, and tending to render more effectual what the
contracting powers in the quadruple alliance were before
engaged to see performed. He assured them that all former
conventions made with Spain in favour of the British
trade and navigation were renewed and confirmed: that
the free uninterrupted exercise of their commerce was
restored: that the court of Spain had agreed to an ample
restitution and reparation for unlawful seisures and depre∣dations:
that all rights, privileges, and possessions, belong∣ing
to him and his allies, were solemnly re-established, con∣firmed,
and guaranteed; and that not one concession was
made to the prejudice of his subjects. He told them he
had given orders for reducing a great number of his land-forces,
and for laying up great part of the fleet; and
observed that there would be a considerable saving in the
expense of the current year. After both Houses had pre∣sented
their addresses of thanks and congratulation to the
King on the peace of Seville, the Lords took that treaty
into consideration, and it did not pass enquiry without
severe animadversion.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. The lords in the opposition excepted to the ar∣ticle
by which the merchants of Great-Britain were
obliged to make proof of their losses at the court of Spain.
They said this stipulation was a hardship upon British sub∣jects,
and dishonourable to the nation: that few would care
to undertake such a troublesome and expensive journey, es∣pecially
as they had reason to apprehend their claims
would be counterbalanced by the Spaniards; and, after
all, they would have no more but the slender comfort of
<PB N="448" REF="454"/>
hoping to obtain that redress by commissaries which they
had not been able to procure by plenipotentiaries. They
thought it very extraordinary, that Great-Britain should
be bound to ratify and guarantee whatever agreement
should be made between the King of Spain and the Dukes
of Parma and Tuscany, concerning the garrisons once
established in their countries: that the English should be
obliged to assist in effectuating the introduction of six
thousand Spanish troops into the towns of Tuscany and
Parma, without any specification of the methods to be
taken, or the charge to be incurred in giving that assistance:
that they should guarantee for ever, not only to Don
Carlos, but even to all his successors, the possession of the
estates of Tuscany and Parma; a stipulation which in all
probability would involve Great-Britain in endless quarrels
and disputes, about a country with which they had no
concern. They affirmed that the treaty of Seville, instead
of confirming other treaties, was contradictory to the
quadruple alliance, particularly in the article of intro∣ducing
Spanish troops into Tuscany and Parma, in the
room of neutral forces stipulated by the former alliance;
and agreeing that they should there remain until Don
Carlos and his successors should be secure and exempt
from all events. They complained that these alterations,
from the tenour of the quadruple alliance were made
without the concurrence of the Emperor, and even with∣out
inviting him to accede; an affront which might
alienate his friendship from England, and hazard the loss
of such an ancient, powerful, and faithful ally: they de∣clared
that throughout the whole treaty there seemed to be
an artful omission of any express stipulation, to secure
Great-Britain in her right to Gibraltar and Minorca.
Such was the substance of the objections made to the peace:
then Lord Bathurst moved for a resolution, that the agree∣ment
on the treaty of Seville, to secure the succession of
Don Carlos to the duchies of Tuscany, Parma, and Pla∣centia,
with Spanish troops, was a manifest violation of
the fifth article of the quadruple alliance, tending to
<PB N="449" REF="455"/>
involve the nation in a dangerous and expensive war, and
to destroy the balance of power in Europe. The question
was put, and the motion rejected. Such too was the fate
of two other motions, to resolve that Great-Britain's
right of sovereignty, dominion, possession, and claim to
Gibraltar and Minorca were not ascertained by the treaty
of Seville; and that the stipulations in that treaty for
repairing the losses of the British merchants were insuf∣ficient
and precarious. The majority, far from stigma∣tising
this transaction, resolved that the treaty did contain
all necessary stipulations for maintaining and securing the
honour, dignity, rights, and possessions of the crown: that
all due care was taken therein for the support of the trade
of the kingdom, and for repairing the losses sustained by
the British merchants. On these resolutions an address of
approbation was founded: but, when a motion was made
for an address to his Majesty, that he would order to be
laid before the House a list of all pensions payable to the
crown, it was immediately resolved in the negative. Divers
contests of the same kind arose upon the mutiny-bill, the
pension-bill, and the maintenance of the twelve thousand
Hessians; but the ministry bore down all opposition,
though their triumphs were clogged with vigorous protests,
which did not fail to make impression upon the body of the
people.</P>
<P>§ XIX. Nor was the success of the court interest in the
House of Commons altogether pure, and free from excep∣tion
and dispute. When the charge of the land-forces
fell under the consideration of the Commons, and Mr.
Henry Pelham, secretary at war, moved that the number
of the effective men for the land-service of the ensuing
year should be fixed at seventeen thousand seven hundred
and nine, Mr. Pulteney insisted upon its being reduced to
twelve thousand. Mr. Shippen affirmed that Mr. Pel∣ham's
motion was a flat negative to the address for which
he voted on the first day of the session, as it plainly im∣plied
a distrust of the validity of the late treaty, which he
then assured the House would immediately produce all
<PB N="450" REF="456"/>
the blessings of an absolute peace; and deliver the king∣dom
from the apprehensions and inconveniencies of a
war. He said the motion tended directly towards the
establishment of an army in Great-Britain, which he hop∣ed
would never be so far Germanised, as tamely to submit
to a military government. He observed that the nation
could have no occasion for all the troops that were demand∣ed,
considering the glorious scene of affairs which was
now opened to all Europe. “They are not necessary (said
he) to awe Spain into a firm adherence to its own trea∣ty:
they are not necessary to force the Emperor into an
immediate accession; nor are they in any sort necessary
for the safety of his Majesty's person and government.
Force and violence are the resort of usurpers and tyrants
only; because they are, with good reason, distrustful of
the people whom they oppress; and because they have
no other security for the continuance of their unlawful
and unnatural dominion, than what depends entirely on
the strength of their armies.” The motion, however,
was carried in the affirmative.</P>
<P>§ XX. Another warm debate was excited by a bill
which the courtiers brought in, to prevent any subjects of
Great-Britain from advancing sums of money to foreign
princes or states, without having obtained license from
his Majesty, under his privy-seal, or some greater authority.
The minister pretended that this law was proposed to dis∣able
the Emperor, who wanted to borrow a great sum of
the English merchants, for raising and maintaining troops
to disturb the tranquillity of Europe. The bill contained
a clause, empowering the King to prohibit by proclamation
all such loans of money, jewels, or bullion: the Attorney-General
was empowered to compel, by English bill, in the
court of Exchequer, the effectual discovery, on oath, of
any such loans; and it was enacted, that in default of an
answer to any such bill, the court should decree a limited
sum against the person refusing to answer. Mr. Daniel
Pulteney, a gentleman of uncommon talents and ability,
and particularly acquainted with every branch of commerce,
<PB N="451" REF="457"/>
argued strenuously against this bill, as a restraint upon
trade that would render Holland the market of Europe,
and the mart of money to the nations of the continent.
He said, that by this general prohibition, extending to all
princes, states, or potentates, the English were totally
disabled from assisting their best allies: that among others
the King of Portugal frequently borrowed money of the
English merchants residing within his dominions: that
while the licensing power remained in the crown, the
licenses would be issued through the hands of the minister,
who by this new trade might gain twenty, thirty, or
forty thousand a-year; that the bill would render the Ex∣chequer
a court of inquisition; and that whilst it restrain∣ed
our merchants from assisting the princes and powers of
Europe, it permitted our stock-jobbers to trade in their
funds without interruption. Other arguments of equal
weight were enforced by Mr. Barnard, a merchant of Lon∣don,
who perfectly understood trade in all its branches,
spoke with judgment and precision, and upon all occa∣sions
steadily adhered to the interests and liberties of his
country. After having explained his reasons, he declared
he should never consent to a bill which he deemed a vio∣lation
of our fundamental laws, a breach of our dearest
liberties, and a very terrible hardship on mankind. Sir
William Wyndham distinguished himself on the same side
of the question. The bill was vindicated by Sir Robert
Walpole, Mr. Pelham, and Sir Philip Yorke, attorney-ge∣neral;
and being supported by the whole weight of mini∣sterial
influence, not only passed through the House, but
was afterwards enacted into a law.</P>
<P>§ XXI. The subsidies were continued to the Landgrave
of Hesse-Cassel, and the Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel,
in spite of all that could be urged against these extraneous
incumberances; and the supply for the ensuing year was
granted according to the estimates which the ministry
thought proper to produce, amounting to about two mil∣lions
two hundred and eighty thousand pounds. It must
be owned, however, for the credit of this session, that the
House appropriated one million of the surpluses arising
<PB N="452" REF="458"/>
from the sinking fund towards the discharge of the national
debt; and by another act extinguished the duties upon
salt, by which expedient the subject was eased of a heavy
burthen, not only in being freed from the duty, but also
from a considerable charge of salaries given to a great
number of officers employed to collect this imposition.
They likewise encouraged the colony of Carolina with an
act, allowing the planters and traders of that province to
export rice directly to any part of Europe southward of
Cape Finisterre; and they permitted salt from Europe to
be imported into the colony of New-York. The term of
the exclusive trade granted by act of parliament to the
East-India company drawing towards a period, many con∣siderable
merchants and others made application for being
incorporated and vested with the privilege of trading to
those countries, proposing to lay that branch of trade open
to all the subjects of Great-Britain, on certain conditions.
In consideration of an act of parliament for this purpose,
they offered to advance three millions two hundred thou∣sand
pounds, for redeeming the fund and trade of the
present East-India company. This proposal was rejected;
and the exclusive privilege vested in the company was, by
act of parliament, protracted to the year one thousand
seven hundred and sixty-six, upon the following condi∣tions:
That they should pay into the Exchequer the sum
of two hundred thousand pounds towards the supplies of
the year, without interest or addition to their capital stock;
That the annuity or yearly fund of one hundred and sixty
thousand pounds, payable to them from the publick,
should be reduced to one hundred and twenty-eight thou∣sand;
That after the year one thousand seven hundred and
sixty-six, their right to the exclusive trade should be liable
to be taken away by parliament, on three years notice, and
repayment of their capital.</P>
<P>§ XXII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1730.</NOTE> On the fifteenth day of May the King went
to the House of Peers, and closed the session. In his
speech he expressed his joy, that, notwithstanding all the
clamours which were raised, the parliament had approved
of those matters which fell under their consideration; a
<PB N="453" REF="459"/>
circumstance which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IV. 1730.</NOTE> he said, could not fail to inspire all
mankind with a just detestation of those incendiaries, who,
by scandalous libels, laboured to alienate the affections of
his people; to fill their minds with groundless jealousies
and unjust complaints, in dishonour of him and his govern∣ment,
and in defiance of the sense of both Houses of par∣liament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the course of this session the Commons passed a bill for making more effectual the laws in being, for disabling persons from being chosen members of parliament who enjoyed any pension during pleasure, or for any number of years, or any offices holden in trust for them, by obliging all persons hereafter to be chosen to serve for the Commons in parliament to take the oath therein mentioned. In all probability this bill would not have made its way through the House of Commons, had not the minister been well assured it would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with the Upper-House, where it was rejected at the second reading, though not without violent opposition.</NOTE>. The Emperor was so much incensed at the
insult offered to him in the treaty of Seville, with respect
to the garrisons of Tuscany and Parma, that he prohibited
the subjects of Great-Britain from trading in his dominions:
he began to make preparations for war, and actually de∣tached
bodies of troops to Italy, with such dispatch as
had been very seldom exerted by the house of Austria.
Yet the article of which he complained was not so much
a real injury as an affront put upon the head of the empire;
for the eventual succession to those Italian duchies had
been secured to the Infant, Don Carlos, by the quadruple
alliance; and all that the Emperor required, was, that
this prince should receive the investiture of them as fiefs of
the empire.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. In Great-Britain, this year was not distin∣guished
by any transaction of great moment. Seven chiefs
of the Cherokee nations of Indians in America were
brought to England by Sir Alexander Cumin. Being in∣troduced
to the King, they laid their crown and regalia at
his feet; and by an authentick deed acknowledged them∣selves
subjects to his dominion, in the name of all their
compatriots, who had vested them with full powers for
this purpose. They were amazed and confounded at the
riches and magnificence of the British court; they com∣pared
the King and Queen to the Sun and Moon, the princes
<PB N="454" REF="460"/>
to the stars of heaven, and themselves to nothing.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1730.</NOTE> They
gave their assent in the most solemn manner to articles of
friendship and commerce, proposed by the lords commis∣sioners
for trade and plantations; and being loaded with
presents of necessaries, arms, and ammunition, were re∣conveyed
to their own country, which borders on the pro∣vince
of South-Carolina. In the month of September a
surprising revolution was effected at Constantinople, with∣out
bloodshed or confusion. A few mean Janissaries
displayed a flag in the streets, exclaiming that all true
Mussulmen ought to follow them, and assist in reform∣ing
the government. They soon increased to the number
of one hundred thousand, marched to the Seraglio, and
demanded the Grand Vizir, the Kiaja, and Capitan
Pacha. These unhappy ministers were immediately
strangled. Their bodies being delivered to the insurgents,
were dragged through the streets; and afterwards thrown
to the dogs to be devoured. Not contented with this
sacrifice, the revolters deposed the Grand Signor Achmet,
who was confined to the same prison from whence they
brought his nephew Machmut, and raised this last to the
throne, after he had lived seven-and-twenty years in con∣finement.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. England was at this period infested with
robbers, assassins, and incendiaries, the natural conse∣quences
of degeneracy, corruption, and the want of police
in the interior government of the kingdom. This defect,
in a great measure, arose from an absurd notion, that
laws necessary to prevent those acts of cruelty, violence,
and rapine would be incompatible with the liberty of
British subjects; a notion that confounds all distinctions
between liberty and brutal licentiousness, as if that free∣dom
was desireable, in the enjoyment of which people find
no security for their lives or effects. The peculiar de∣pravity
of the times was visible even in the conduct of
those who preyed upon the commonwealth. Thieves and
robbers were now become more desperate and savage than
ever they had appeared since mankind was civilized. In
the exercise of their rapine, they wounded, maimed, and
<PB N="455" REF="461"/>
even murthered the unhappy sufferers, through a wanton∣ness
of barbarity. They circulated letters, demanding sums
of money from certain individuals, on pain of reducing
their houses to ashes, and their families to ruin: and even
set fire to the house of a rich merchant in Bristol, who
had refused to comply with their demand. The same spe∣cies
of villainy was practised in different parts of the king∣dom;
so that the government was obliged to interpose, and
offer a considerable reward for discovering the ruffians con∣cerned
in such execrable designs.</P>
<P>§ XXV. In the speech with which the King opened
the session of parliament on the twenty-first day of Janu∣ary,
he told them, that the present critical conjucture
seemed in a very particular manner to deserve their at∣tention:
that as the transactions then depending in the
several courts of Europe were upon the point of being
determined, the great event of peace or war might be very
much affected by their first resolutions, which were ex∣pected
by different powers with great impatience. He
said, the continuance of that zeal and vigour with which
they had hitherto supported him and his engagements
must at this time be of the greatest weight and importance,
both with regard to his allies, and to those who might be
disposed, before the season of action, to prevent by an
accommodation the fatal consequences of a general rup∣ture.
The former scene was repeated. Both Houses, in
their addresses, promised to support his Majesty in all his
engagements; yet the members in the opposition demon∣strated
the absurdity of promising to fulfil engagements,
before they could possibly know whether or not they were
for the service of Great-Britain. Another bill was brought
into the House of Commons, to prevent pensioners from
sitting as members of parliament; and, after a third read∣ing,
carried up to the Lords for their concurrence. When
the supply sell under consideration, the debates were re∣newed
upon the subsidies to the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel
and the Duke of Wolsenbuttel, which, however, were
continued; and every article was granted according to the
<PB N="456" REF="462"/>
estimates given in for the expense of the ensuing year.
Two petitions being presented to the Commons, repre∣senting
the delays of justice, occasioned by the use of the
Latin tongue in proceedings at law, a bill was brought
in for changing this practice, and enacting, That all
those processes and pleadings should be entered in the
English language. Though one would imagine that very
little could be advanced against such a regulation, the
bill met with warm opposition, on pretence that it would
render useless the ancient records which were written in
that language, and introduce confusion and delay of
justice, by altering the established form and method of
pleading: in spite of these objections, it passed through
both Houses, and received the royal assent. A great
number of merchants from different parts of the kingdom
having repeated their complaints of depredations and
cruelties committed by the Spaniards in the West-Indies,
their petitions were referred to the consideration of a grand
committee. Their complaints upon examination appeared
to be well founded. The House presented an address to
the King, desiring his Majesty would be graciously pleased
to continue his endeavour to prevent such depredations for
the future; to procure full satisfaction for the damages
already sustained; and to secure to the British subjects the
full and uninterrupted exercise of their trade and navi∣gation
to and from the British colonies in America. The
bill against pensions produced a warm debate in the House
of Lords, where it was violently opposed by the Dukes of
Newcastle and Argyl, the Earl of Ilay, and Dr. Sher∣lock,
Bishop of Bangor. This prelate, in a remarkable
speech, represented it as a scheme to enlarge the power of
the House of Commons, and to break the balance between
the powers essential to the constitution, so as sooner or
later to prove the ruin of the whole. The great barrier
provided against bribery and corruption by this bill consisted
in an oath to be imposed on all members of the Lower
House, by which they must have solemnly sworn and de∣clared,
that they had not directly, nor indirectly, any pension
<PB N="457" REF="463"/>
during pleasure, or for any number of years, or any office
in part, or in the whole, held for them, or for their benefit,
by any persons whatsoever; and that they would not ac∣cept
any such pensions or offices, without signifying the
same to the House within fourteen days after they should
be received or accepted. The bill was vindicated as just
and necessary by the Earls of Winchelsea and Strafford,
Lord Bathurst, and Lord Carteret, who had by this time
joined as an auxiliary in the opposition.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nothing was heard within doors in parliament, but sarcastick repartee and violent decl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nation between the two parties, who did not consine their altercation to these debates, but took the field against each other in periodical <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>apers, and occasional pamphlets. The paper called the Cras<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sman had already risen into high reputation all over England, for the wit, humour, and solid reasoning it contained. Some of the best writers in the opposition, including Lord Bolingbroke and Mr. P. made use of this vehicle to convey their animadversions upon the minister, who, on his side, employed the most <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tetched scribblers to defend his conduct. It was in consequence of two po∣litical pamphlets, written in opposition to each other, by Lord Hervey and Mr. P and some recrimination they produced in the House of Commons, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> challenged the other to simple combat, and had well nigh lost his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the duel, which was fought in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yde-Park.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>§ XXVI.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1731.</NOTE> The House of Peers proceeded to consider
the state of the national debt; they read a bill for the free
importation of wool from Ireland into England, which
was fiercely opposed, and laid aside, contrary to all the
rules of sound policy. They passed the bill for carrying
on proceedings at law in the English language; and a
fruitless motion was made by Lord Bathurst for an
address, to desire his Majesty would give directions for
discharging the Hessian troops that were in the pay of
Great-Britain. On the seventh day of May the parlia∣ment
was prorogued, after the King had given them to
understand, that all apprehensions of war were now happily
removed, by a treaty signed at Vienna between him and
the Emperor. He said it was communicated to the courts
of France and Spain, as parties to the treaty of Seville,
the execution of which it principally regarded; and that
it was likewise submitted to the consideration of the States-General.
He observed, that the conditions and engage∣ments
<PB N="458" REF="464"/>
into which he had entered on this occasion were
agreeable to that necessary concern which the British nation
must always have for the security and preservation of the
balance of power in Europe:<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1731.</NOTE> and that this happy turn,
duly improved with a just regard to former alliances, yield∣ed
a favourable prospect of seeing the publick tranquillity
re-established.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. In the month of January the Duke of Parma
died, after having made a will, in which he declared his
duchess was three months advanced in her pregnancy;
entreating the allied powers of Europe to have compassion
upon his people, and defer the execution of their projects
until his consort should be delivered. In case the child
should be still born, or die after the birth, he bequeathed
his dominions and allodial estates to the Infant Don Carlos
of Spain; and appointed five regents to govern the duchy.
Notwithstanding this disposition, a body of Imperial troops
immediately took possession of Parma and Placentia, under
the command of General Stampa, who declared they
should conduct themselves with all possible regularity and
moderation, and leave the administration entirely to the
regents whom the Duke had appointed. They publickly
proclaimed in the market-place, that they took possession
of these duchies for the Infant, Don Carlos: and that if
the Duchess Dowager should not be delivered of a prince,
the said Infant might receive the investiture from the Em∣peror
whenever he would, provided he should come with∣out
an army. Though these steps seemed to threaten an
immediate war, the King of Great-Britain and the States-General
interposed their mediation so effectu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly with the
court of Vienna, that the Emperor desisted from the pro∣secution
of his design; and on the sixteenth day of March
concluded at Vienna a treaty with his Britannick Majesty,
by which he consented to withdraw his troops from Parma
and Placentia. He agreed, That the King of Spain might
take possession of these places in favour of his son. Do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Carlos, according to the treaty of Seville. He likewise
agreed, That the Ostend company, which had given
<PB N="459" REF="465"/>
such umbrage to the maritime powers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IV. 1731.</NOTE> should be totally
dissolved, on condition that the contracting powers con∣cerned
in the treaty of Seville should guarantee the prag∣matick
sanction, or succession of the Austrian hereditary
dominions to the heirs female of the Emperor, in case he
should die without male issue. The Dutch minister re∣siding
at the Imperial court did not subscribe this treaty,
because, by the maxims received in that republick, and
the nature of her government, he could not be vested with
full powers so soon as it would have been necessary: never∣theless,
the States-General were, by a separate article, ex∣pressly
named as a principal contracting party.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. On the twenty-second day of July a new
treaty was signed at Vienna between the Emperor and the
Kings of Great-Britain and Spain, tending to confirm the
former. In August a treaty of union and defensive alliance
between the electorates of Saxony and Hanover was
executed at Dresden. The court of Spain expressing some
doubts with regard to the pregnancy of the Duchess of
Parma, she underwent a formal examination by five mid∣wives
of different nations, in presence of the older Duchess
Dowager, several ladies of quality, three physicians, and a
surgeon; and was declared with child: nevertheless,
after having kept all Europe in suspense for six months,
she owned she had been deceived; and General Stampa,
with the Imperial forces, took formal possession of the
duchies of Parma and Placentia. Spain and the great Duke
of Tuscany having acceded to the last treaty of Vienna,
the crown of Great-Britain engaged to equip an armament
that should convoy Don Carlos to his new dominions.
Accordingly, Sir Charles Wager sailed with a strong squa∣dron
from Portsmouth on the twenty-sixth day of August;
and in September arrived at Barcelona, where being joined
by the Spanish sleet and transports, they sailed together to
Leghorn; from whence the Admiral returned to England-Don
Carlos passed through part of France, and embarking
at Antibes on board of the Spanish gallies, arrived at
Leghorn in December. Then the Imperial General with∣drew
<PB N="460" REF="466"/>
his forces into the Milanese; and the Infant took
possession of his new territories.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. During these transactions France was distracted
by religious disputes, occasioned by the bull unigenitus
thundered against the doctrines of Jansenius; a bull which
had produced a schism in the Gallican church, and well
nigh involved that country in civil war and confusion. It
was opposed by the parliaments and lay tribunals of the
kingdom; but many bishops, and the Jesuits in general,
were its most strenuous asserters. All the artifices of priest-craft
were practised on both sides, to inflame the enthu∣siasm,
and manage the superstition of the people. Pre∣tended
miracles were wrought at the tomb of Abbé
Paris, who had died without accepting the bull, conse∣quently
was declared damned by the abettors of that con∣stitution.
On the other hand, the Jesuits exerted all their
abilities and industry in preaching against the Jansenists;
in establishing an opinion of their superior sanctity; and
inspiring a spirit of quietism among their votaries, who
were transported into the delirium of possession, illumi∣nation,
and supernatural converse. These arts were often
used for the most infamous purposes. Female enthusiasts
were wrought up to such a violence of agitations, that
nature fainted under the struggle, and the pseudo-saint
seised this opportunity of violating the chastity of his
penitent. Such was said to be the case of Mademoiselle
la Cadiere, a young gentlewoman of Toulon, abused in
this manner by the lust and villainy of Pere Girard, a noted
Jesuit, who underwent a trial before the parliament of Ai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
and very narrowly escaped the stake.</P>
<P>§ XXX. The parliament of Great-Britain meeting on
the thirteenth day of January, the King in his speech de∣clared,
that the general tranquillity of Europe was restored
and established by the last treaty of Vienna: that Don
Carlos was actually possessed of Parma and Placentia:
that six thousand Spaniards were quietly admitted and
quartered in the duchy of Tuscany, to secure, by the ex∣press
consent and agreement of the Great Duke, the
<PB N="461" REF="467"/>
reversion of his dominions; and that a family convention
was made between the courts of Spain and Tuscany, for
preserving mutual peace and friendship in the two houses.
He told the Commons, that the estimates for the service of
the current year would be considerably less than those of
former years. He recommended unanimity: he observed
that this government had no security but what was equally
conducive to their happiness, and to the protection of his
people: that their prosperity had no foundation but in the
defence and support of his government. “Our safety,
(said he) is mutual, and our interests are inseparable.”
The opposition to the court measures appears to have been
uncommonly spirited during the course of this session.
The minister's motions were attacked with all the artil∣lery
of elocution. His principal emissaries were obliged
to task their faculties to their full exertion, to puzzle
and perplex where they could not demonstrate and con∣vice,
to misrepresent what they could not vindicate,
and elude the arguments which they could not refute. In
the House of Commons Lord Hervey, lately appointed
vince-chamberlain of his Majesty's household, made a
motion for an address of thanks, in which they should
declare their entire approbation of the King's conduct,
acknowledge the blessings they enjoyed under his govern∣ment,
express their confidence in the wisdom of his coun∣cils;
and declare their readiness to grant the necessary
supplies. This member, son to the Earl of Bristol, was
a nobleman of some parts, which, however, were more
specious than solid. He condescended to act as a subaltern
to the minister, and approved himself extremely active in
forwarding all his designs, whether as a secret emissary
or publick orator; in which last capacity he appears to
have been pert, frivolous, and frothy. His motion was
seconded by Mr. Clutterbuck, and opposed by Sir Wil∣fred
Lawson, Mr. Shippen, Mr. W. Pulteney, Sir Wil∣liam
Wyndham, and Mr. Oglethorpe. They did not argue
against a general address of thanks; but exposed the ab∣surdity
and bad tendency of expressions which implied a
<PB N="462" REF="468"/>
blind approbation of all the measures of the ministry. Sir
Wilfred Lawson observed, that notwithstanding the great
things we had done for the crown of Spain, and the favours
we had procured for the royal family of that kingdom,
little or no satisfaction had as yet been received for the
injuries our merchants had sustained from that nation.
Mr. Pulteney took notice, that the nation, by becoming
guarantee to the pragmatick sanction, laid itself under an
obligation to assist the Austrian family when attacked by
any potentate whatever, except the Grand Signior: that
they might be attacked when it would be much against the
interest of the kingdom to engage itself in a war upon
any foreign account: that it might one day be for the
interest of the nation to join against them, in order to pre∣serve
the balance of Europe, the establishing of which
had already cost England such immense sums of money.
He insisted upon the absurdity of concluding such a num∣ber
of inconsistent treaties; and concluded with saying,
that if affairs abroad were now happily established, the
ministry which conducted them might be compared to a
pilot, who, though there was a clear, safe, and straight
channel into port, yet took it in his head to carry the ship
a great way about, through sands, rocks, and shallows;
who, after having lost a great number of seamen, destroyed
a great deal of tackle and rigging, and subjected the
owners to an enormous expense, at last by chance hits the
port, and triumphs in his good conduct. Sir William
Wyndham spoke to the same purpose. Mr. Oglethorpe, a
gentleman of unblemished character, brave, generous, and
humane, affirmed that many other things related more
nearly to the honour and interest of the nation than did
the guarantee of the pragmatick sanction. He said he
wished to have heard that the new works at Dunkirk had
been entirely rased and destroyed: that the nation had
received full and complete satisfaction for the depredations
committed by the natives of Spain: that more care we
taken in disciplining the militia, on whose valour th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
nation must chiefly depend in case of an invasion; and
<PB N="463" REF="469"/>
that some regard had been shown to the oppressed pro∣testants
in Germany. He expressed his satisfaction to find
that the English were not so closely united to France as
formerly; for he had generally observed, that when two
dogs were in a leash together, the stronger generally ran
away with the weaker; and this, he was afraid, had been
the case between France and Great-Britain. The motion
was vigorously defended by Mr. Pelham, paymaster of the
forces, and brother to the Duke of Newcastle, a man
whose greatest fault was his being concerned in supporting
the measures of a corrupt ministry. In other respects he
was liberal, candid, benevolent, and even attached to the
interest of his country, though egregiously mistaken in his
notions of government. On this occasion he asserted that
it was no way inconsistent with the honour or dignity of
that House to thank his Majesty in the most particular
terms for every thing he had been pleased to communicate
in his speech from the throne: that no expressions of ap∣probation
in the address could be any way made use of to
prevent an enquiry into the measures which had been pur∣sued,
when the treaties should be laid before the House.
He said, at the opening of a session the eyes of all Europe
were turned towards Great-Britain, and from the par∣liament's
first resolves all the neighbouring powers judged
of the unanimity that would ensue between his Majesty
and the representatives of his people: that their appearing
jealous or dissident of his Majesty's conduct would weaken
his influence upon the councils of foreign states and po∣tentates,
and perhaps put it out of his power to rectify
any false step that might have been made by his ministers.
His arguments were re-enforced by a long speech from Mr.
H. Walpole. The question was put, the motion carried,
and the address presented.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. The next subject of debate was the number
of land-forces. When the supply sell under consideration,
Sir W. Strickland, secretary at war, moved that the same
number which had been maintained in the preceding year
should be continued in pay. On the other hand, Lord
<PB N="464" REF="470"/>
Morpeth having demonstrated the danger to which the
liberties of the nation might be exposed, by maintaining a
numerous standing army in time of peace, made a motion
that the number should be reduced to twelve thousand. A
warm dispute ensuing, was managed in favour of the first
motion by Lord Hervey, Sir Robert Walpole and his
brother, Mr. Pelham, and Sir Philip Yorke, attorney-general.
This gentleman was counted a better lawyer
than a politician, and shone more as an advocate at the
bar than as an orator in the House of Commons. The
last partisan of the ministry was Sir William Yonge, one
of the lords commissioners of the Treasury; a man who
rendered himself serviceable and necessary, by stooping to
all compliances, running upon every scent, and haranguing
on every subject with an even, uninterrupted, tedious slow
of dull declamation, composed of assertions without vera∣city,
conclusions from false premisses, words without mean∣ing,
and language without propriety. Lord Morpeth's
motion was espoused by Mr. Watkin Williams Wynne, a
gentleman of an ancient family and opulent fortune in
Wales, brave, open, hospitable, and warmly attached to
the ancient constitution and hierarchy: he was supported
by Mr. Walter Plumer, who spoke with weight, precision,
and severity, by Sir, W. Wyndham, Mr. Shippen, Mr.
W. Pulteney, and Mr. Barnard. The courtiers argued
that it was necessary to maintain such a number of land-forces
as might defeat the designs of malcontents, secure
the interior tranquillity of the kingdom, defend it from
external assaults, over-awe its neighbours, and enable it to
take vigorous measures in case the peace of Europe should
be re-embroiled. They affirmed the science of war was
so much altered, and required such attention, that no de∣pendence
was to be placed upon a militia: that all nations
were obliged to maintain standing armies, for their security
against the encroachments of neighbouring powers: that
the number of troops in Great-Britain was too incon∣siderable
to excite the jealousy of the people, even under
an ambitious monarch: that his Majesty never entertained
<PB N="465" REF="471"/>
the least thought of infringing the liberties of his subjects;
that it could not be supposed that the officers, among
whom were many gentlemen of family and fortune, would
ever concur in a design to enslave their country; and that
the forces now in pay could not be properly deemed a
standing army, inasmuch as they were voted and main∣tained
from year to year by the parliament, which was
the representative of the people. To these arguments the
members in the opposition replied, that a standing force
in time of peace was unconstitutional, and had been always
thought dangerous; that a militia was as capable of disci∣pline
as a standing army, and would have more incentives
to courage and perseverance; that the civil magistrate was
able to preserve the peace of the country; that the number
of the malcontents was altogether contemptible, though it
might be considerably augmented by maintaining a stand∣ing
army, and other such arbitrary measures; that other
nations had been enslaved by standing armies; and how∣soever
they might find themselves necessitated to depend
upon a military force for security against encroaching
neighbours, the case was very different with regard to
Great-Britain, for the defence of which nature had pro∣vided
in a peculiar manner; that this provision was
strengthened and improved by a numerous navy, which
secured her the dominion of the sea; and, if properly dis∣posed,
would render all invasion impracticable, or at least
ineffectual; that the land-army of Great-Britain, though
sufficient to endanger the liberties of an unarmed people,
could not possibly secure such an extent of coast, and
therefore could be of very little service in preventing an
invasion; that though they had all imaginable confidence
in his Majesty's regard for the liberty of his subjects, they
could not help apprehending, that should a standing army
become part of the constitution, another prince of more
dangerous talents, and more fatal designs, might arise, and
employ it for the worst purposes of ambition; that though
many officers were gentlemen of honour and probity, these
might be easily disearded, and the army gradually moulded
<PB N="466" REF="472"/>
into a quite different temper. By these means, practised
in former times, an army had been new-modelled to such
a degree, that they turned their swords against the par∣liament,
for whose defence they had been raised, and de∣stroyed
the constitution both in church and state: that with
respect to its being wholly dependant on the parliament,
the people of England would have reason to complain of
the same hardship, whether a standing army should be
declared at once indispensable, or regularly voted from year
to year, according to the direction of the ministry: that
the sanction of the legislature granted to measures which
in themselves are unconstitutional, burthensome, odious,
and repugnant to the genius of the nation, instead of
yielding consolation, would serve only to demonstrate,
that the most effectual method of forging the chains of
national slavery would be that of ministerial influence
operating upon a venal parliament. Such were the reasons
urged against a standing army, of what number soever it
might be composed: but the expediency of reducing the
number from about eighteen thousand to twelve thousand
was insisted upon as the natural consequences of his Ma∣jesty's
declaration, by which they were given to under∣stand
that the peace of Europe was established; and that
he had nothing so much at heart as the case and prosperity
of his people. It was suggested, that if eighteen thousand
men were sufficient on the supposed eve of a general war
in Europe, it was surely reasonable to think that a less
number would suffice when peace was perfectly re-esta∣blished.
Whatever effect these reasons had upon the body
of the nation, they made no converts in the House, where
the majority resolved that the standing army should be
maintained without reduction. Mr. Plumer complained
that the country was oppressed by an arbitrary method of
quartering soldiers, in an undue proportion, upon those
publicans who refused to vote in elections according to
the direction of the ministry. Mr. Pulteney asserted that
the money raised for the subsistence of eighteen thousand
men in England would maintain sixty thousand French
<PB N="467" REF="473"/>
or Germans, or the same number of almost any other peo∣ple
on the continent. Sir William Wyndham declared that
eighteen thousand of the English troops in the late war
were maintained on less than two-thirds of the sum now
demanded for the like number; but no regard was paid to
these allegations.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. The next object of importance that attracted
the notice of the House was the state of the charitable
corporation. This company was first erected in the year
one thousand seven hundred and seven. Their professed
intention was to lend money at legal interest to the poor,
upon small pledges; and to persons of better rank upon
an indubitable security of goods impawned. Their capital
was at first limited to thirty thousand pounds; but, by
licenses from the crown, they increased it to six hundred
thousand pounds, though their charter was never con∣firmed
by act of parliament. In the month of October,
George Robinson, Esquire, member for Marlow, the
cashier, and John Thompson, warehouse-keeper of the
corporation, disappeared in one day. The proprietors,
alarmed at this incident, held several general courts, and
appointed a committee to inspect the state of their affairs.
They reported, that for a capital of above five hundred
thousand pounds no equivalent was found; inasmuch as
their effects did not amount to the value of thirty thousand,
the remainder having been embezzled by means which
they could not discover. The proprietors, in a petition
to the House of Commons, represented that by the most
notorious breach of trust in several persons to whom
the care and management of their affairs were committed,
the corporation had been defrauded of the greatest part of
their capital; and that many of the petitioners were re∣duced
to the utmost degree of misery and distress: they,
therefore, prayed, that as they were unable to detect the
combinations of those who had ruined them, or to bring the
delinquents to justice, without the aid of the power and
authority of parliament, the House would vouchsafe to
enquire into the state of the corporation, and the conduct
<PB N="468" REF="474"/>
of their managers; and give such relief to the petitioners
as to the House should seem meet. The petition was
graciously received, and a secret committee appointed to
proceed on the enquiry. They soon discovered a most
iniquitous scene of fraud, which had been acted by Robin∣son
and Thompson, in concert with some of the directors,
for embezzling the capital, and cheating the proprietors.
Many persons of rank and quality were concerned in this
infamous conspiracy; some of the first characters in the
nation did not escape suspicion and censure. Sir Robert
Sutton and Sir Archibald Grant were expelled the House
of Commons, as having had a considerable share in those
fraudulent practices; a bill was brought in, to restrain
them and other delinquents from leaving the kingdom, or
alienating their effects. In the mean time, the committee
received a letter from Signor John Angelo Belloni, an
eminent banker at Rome, giving them to understand, that
Thompson was secured in that city, with all his papers,
and consined to the castle of St. Angelo; and that the
papers were transmitted to his correspondent at Paris, who
would deliver them up, on certain conditions stipulated in
favour of the prisoner. This letter was considered as an
artifice to insinuate a favourable opinion of the Pretender,
as if he had taken measures for securing Thompson, from
his zeal for justice, and affection to the English people.
On this supposition, the proposals were rejected with dis∣dain;
and both Houses concurred in an order that the
letter should be burned at the Royal Exchange, by the
hands of the common hangman. The Lower House re∣solved
that it was an insolent and audacious libel, absurd
and contradictory; that the whole transaction was a scan∣dalous
artifice, calculated to delude the unhappy, and to
disguise and conceal the wicked practices of the prosessed
enemies to his Majesty's person, crown, and dignity.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. No motion, during this session, produced
such a warm contest as did that of Sir Robert Walpole,
when, after a long preamble, he proposed that the duties
upon salt, which about two years before had been abolished,
<PB N="469" REF="475"/>
should now be revived, and granted to his Majesty,
his heirs and successors, for the term of three years. In
order to sweeten this proposal, he declared that the land-tax
for the ensuing year should be reduced to one shilling
in the pound. All the members of the country-party
were immediately in commotion. They expressed their
surprise at the grossness of the imposition. They observed
that two years had scarce elapsed since the King, in a
speech from the throne, had exhorted them to abolish some
of the taxes that were the most burthensome to the poor:
the House was then of opinion, that the tax upon salt
was the most burthensome, and the most pernicious to the
trade of the kingdom, of all the impositions to which the
poor were subjected, and therefore it was taken off; but
that no good reason could be produced for altering their
opinion so suddenly, and resolving to grind the faces of
the poor, in order to case a few rich men of the landed in∣terest.
They affirmed that the most general taxes are not
always the least burthensome; that after a nation is
obliged to extend their taxes farther than the luxuries of
their country, those taxes that can be raised with the least
charge to the publick are the most convenient and easiest
to the people; but they ought carefully to avoid taxing
those things which are necessary for the subsistence of the
poor. The price of all necessaries being thus enhanced,
the wages of the tradesman and manufacturer must be
increased; and where these are high the manufactures
will be undersold by those of cheaper countries. The
trade must of consequence be ruined; and it is not to be
supposed that the landed gentleman would choose to save a
shilling in the pound from the land-tax, by means of an
expedient that would ruin the manufactures of his country,
and decrease the value of his own fortune. They alledged
that the salt-tax particularly affected the poor, who could
not afford to eat fresh provisions; and that, as it formerly
occasioned murmurs and discontents among the lower
class of people, the revival of it would, in all probability,
e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sperate them into open sedition. They observed, that
<PB N="470" REF="476"/>
while it was exacted in England a great number of mer∣chants
sent their ships to Ireland, to be victualled for their
respective voyages: that, since it had been abolished,
many experiments had been successfully tried with salt
for the improvement of agriculture, which would be en∣tirely
defeated by the revival of this imposition. They
suggested that the land-tax was raised at a very small ex∣pense,
and subject to no fraud, whereas that upon salt
would employ a great number of additional officers in the
revenue, wholly depending upon the ministry, whose in∣fluence
in elections they would proportionably increase.
They even hinted, that this consideration was one power∣ful
motive for proposing the revival of an odious tax,
which was in effect an excise, and would be deemed a
step towards a general excise upon all sorts of provisions.
Finally, they demonstrated that the salt-tax introduced
numberless frauds and perjuries in different articles of
trassick. Sir Robert Walpole endeavoured to obviate all
these objections in a long speech, which was minutely
answered and refuted in every article by Mr. Pulteney.
Nevertheless, the question being put, the minister's motion
was carried in the assirmative, and the duty revived: yet,
before the bill passed, divers motions were made, and ad∣ditional
clauses proposed by the members in the opposition
New debates were raised on every new objection, and the
courtiers were obliged to dispute their ground by inches.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. The pension bill was revived, and for the
third time rejected in the House of Lords. A bill for the
encouragement of the sugar colonies passed through the
Lower House with great difficulty, but was lost among
the Peers: another, for the better securing the freedom of
parliaments, by further qualifying members to sit in the
House of Commons, was read the third time, and thrown
out upon the question. A committee had been appointed
to enquire into a sale of the estate which had belonged to
the late Earl of Derwentwater. It appeared by the report,
that the sale had been fraudulent: a bill was prepared to
make it void: Dennis Bond, Esquire, and Serjeant Birth,
<PB N="471" REF="477"/>
commissioners for the sale of the forfeited estates, were
declared guilty of notorious breach of trust, and expelled
the House, of which they were members: George Robin∣son,
Esquire, underwent the same sentence, on account
of the part he acted in the charitable corporation, as he
and Thompson had neglected to surrender themselves,
according to the terms of a bill which had passed for that
purpose. During this session, five members of parliament
were expelled for the most sordid acts of knavery: a sure
sign of national degeneracy and dishonour. All the sup∣plies
were granted, and, among other articles, the sum of
two-and-twenty thousand six hundred ninety-four pounds,
seven shillings, and sixpence for the agio or difference of
the subsidies payable to the crown of Denmark, in pur∣suance
of the treaty subsisting between the late king and
that monarch: but this was not obtained without a violent
dispute. Mr. Pulteney, who bore a considerable share in
all these debates, became in a little time so remarkable as
to be thought worthy of a very particular mark of his
Majesty's displeasure. The King, on the first day of July,
called for the council-books, and with his own hand struck
the name of William Pultency, Esquire, out of the list of
privy counsellors: his Majesty further ordered him to be
put out of all the commissions of the peace. The several
lord-lieutenants from whom he had received deputations
were commanded to revoke them; and the Lord-Chan∣cellor
and Secretaries of State were directed to give the
necessary orders for that purpose.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. Nor did the House of Peers tamely and
unanimously submit to the measures of the ministry. The
pension-bill being read, was again rejected, and a protest
entered. A debate arose about the number of standing
sorces; and the Earl of Chesterfield argued for the court
motion. The Earl of Oxford moved, that they might be
reduced to twelve thousand effective men. The Earl of
Winchelsea observed, that a standing army rendered mini∣sters
of state more daring than otherwise they would be,
in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> projects that were grievous to
<PB N="472" REF="478"/>
the people: schemes that never could enter into the heads
of any but those who were drunk with excess of power.
The Marquis of Tweedale, in reasoning against such a
number as the ministry proposed, took occasion to observe,
that not one shilling of the forfeited estates was ever ap∣plied
to the use of the publick: he likewise took notice,
that the eighteen thousand men, demanded as a standing
force, were modelled in such a manner, that they might
be speedily augmented to forty thousand men on any
emergency. The Duke of Argyle endeavoured to demon∣strate
the danger of depending for the safety of the king∣dom
upon an undisciplined militia, a fleet, or an army of
auxillaries. Then he represented the necessity of having
recourse to a regular army in case of invasion; and after
all acknowledged that the number proposed was no way
sufficient for that purpose. All his arguments were an∣swered
and refuted in an excellent speech by Lord Car∣teret:
nevertheless, victory declared for the minister. The
parliament having granted every branch of the supply, to∣wards
the payment of which they borrowed a sum from
the sinking fund, and passed divers other acts for the en∣couragement
of commerce and agriculture, the King, on
the first day of June,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1732.</NOTE> gave the royal assent to the bills that
were prepared, and closed the session, after having in∣formed
both Houses that the States-General had acceded
to the treaty of Vienna: that he had determined to visit
his German dominions, and to leave the Queen regent in
his absence. He accordingly set out for Hanover in the
beginning of June. By this time the pragmatick sanction
was confirmed by the diet of the empire, though not with∣out
a formal protest by the Electors Palatine, Bavaria, and
Saxony.</P>

<PB N="474" REF="480"/>
<P>§ I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1732.</NOTE> THE most remarkable incident that distinguish∣ed
this year in England was a very uncommon
instance of suicide; an act of despair so frequent among
the English, that in other countries it is objected to them
as a national reproach. Though it may be generally
termed the effect of lunacy proceeding from natural causes
operating on the human body, in some few instances it
seems to have been the result of cool deliberation. Rich∣ard
Smith, a bookbinder, and prisoner for debt within the
liberties of the King's-Bench, persuaded his wife to follow
his example in making away with herself, after they had
murthered their little infant. This wretched pair were in
the month of April found hanging in their bed-chamber,
at about a yard's distance from each other; and in a
separate apartment the child lay dead in a cradle. They
left two papers enclosed in a short letter to their landlord,
whose kindness they implored in favour of their dog and
cat. They even left money to pay the porter who should
carry the enclosed papers to the person for whom they
were addressed. In one of these the husband thanked that
person for the marks of friendship he had received at his
hands; and complained of the ill offices he had undergone
from a different quarter. The other paper, subscribed by
the husband and wife, contained the reasons which in∣duced
them to act such a tragedy on themselves and their
offspring. This letter was altogether surprising for the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> resolution, the good humour, and the propriety with
which it was written. They declared, that they with∣drew
themselves from poverty and rags; evils <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="475" REF="481"/>
through a train of unlucky accidents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. V. 1732.</NOTE> were become in∣evitable.
They appealed to their neighbours for the in∣dustry
with which they had endeavoured to earn a liveli∣hood.
They justified the murther of their child, by saying
it was less cruelty to take her with them, than to leave
her friendless in the world, exposed to ignorance and
misery. They professed their belief and confidence in an
Almighty God, the fountain of goodness and beneficence,
who could not possibly take delight in the misery of his
creatures: they, therefore, resigned up their lives to him
without any terrible apprehensions; submitting themselves
to those ways which, in his goodness, he should appoint
after death. Those unfortunate suicides had been always
industrious and frugal, invincibly honest, and remarkable
for conjugal affection.</P>
<P>§ II. Trustees having been appointed by charter to
superintend a new settlement in Georgia, situated to the
southward of Carolina in America, Mr. Oglethorpe, as
general, and governor of the province, embarked at Graves∣end,
with a number of poor families, to plant that colony.
The King of Spain having equipped a very powerful arma∣ment,
the fleet sailed on the fourth day of June from the
road of Alicant, under the command of the Count de
Montemar, and arrived on the coast of Barbary in the
neighbourhood of Oran, where a considerable body of
troops was landed without much opposition. Next day,
however, they were attacked by a numerous army of
Moors, over whom they obtained a complete victory.
The Bey or governor of Oran immediately retired with
his garrison, and the Spaniards took possession of the place,
from which they had been driven in the year one thousand
seven hundred and eight. The strong sort of Mazalaquivir
was likewise surrendered to the victors at the first summons;
so that this expedition answered all the views with which
it had been projected. Victor Amadaeus, the abdicated
King of Sardinia, having, at the instigation of his wife,
engaged in some intrigues, in order to re-ascend the throne,
his son, the reigning king, ordered his person to be seised
at Montealier, and conveyed to Rivoli, under a strong
<PB N="476" REF="482"/>
escort. His wife, the Marchioness de Spigno, was con∣ducted
to Seva. The old King's confessor, his physician,
and eight-and-forty persons of distinction were imprisoned.
The citadel of Turin was secured with a stronger garrison;
and new instructions were given to the governor and senate
of Chamberri. The dispute which had long subsisted be∣tween
the King of Prussia and the young Prince of Orange,
touching the succession to the estates possessed by King Wil∣liam
III. as head of the house of Orange, was at last accom∣modated
by a formal treaty signed at Berlin and Dieren.
The Dutch were greatly alarmed about this time with an
apprehension of being overwhelmed by an inundation, oc∣casioned
by worms, which were said to have consumed the
piles and timber-work that supported their dykes. They
prayed and fasted with uncommon zeal, in terrour of this
calamity, which they did not know how to avert in any
other manner. At length, they were delivered from their
fears by a hard frost, which effectually destroyed those dan∣gerous
animals. About this time, Mr. Dieded, plenipoten∣tiary
from the Elector of Hanover, received, in the name
of his master, the investiture of Bremen and Verden from
the hands of the Emperor.</P>
<P>§ III. The history of England at this period cannot be
very interesting, as it chiefly consists in an annual revo∣lution
of debates in parliament. Debates, in which the
same arguments perpetually recur on the same subjects.
When the session was opened on the sixteenth day of Janu∣ary,
the King declared, that the situation of affairs both
at home and abroad rendered it unnecessary for him to lay
before the two Houses any other reasons for calling them
together, but the ordinary dispatch of the public busi∣ness,
and his desire of receiving their advice in such affairs
as should require the care and consideration of parliament.
The motion made in the House of Commons for an address
of thanks implied, that they should express their satisfaction
at the present situation of affairs both at home and abroad.
The motion was carried, notwithstanding the opposition
of those who observed, that the nation had very little rea∣son
to be pleased with the present posture of affairs; that
<PB N="477" REF="483"/>
the French were employed in fortifying and restoring the
harbour of Dunkirk, contrary to the faith of the most so∣lemn
treaties; that the British merchants had received no
redress for the depredations committed by the Spaniards;
that the commerce of England daily decreased; that no
sort of trade throve but the traffick of Change-Alley, where
the most abominable frauds were practised; and that every
session of parliament opened a new scene of villainy and
imposition.</P>
<P>§ IV. The pension bill was once more revived, and
lost again in the House of Peers. All the reasons former∣ly
advanced against a standing army were now repeated;
and a reduction of the number insisted upon with such
warmth, that the ministerial party were obliged to have
recourse to the old phantom of the Pretender. Sir Archer
Croft said a continuation of the same number of forces
was the more necessary, because, to his knowledge, popery
was increasing very fast in the country; for, in one parish
which he knew, there were seven popish priests; and
that the danger from the Pretender was the more to be
feared, because they did not know but he was then breed∣ing
his son a protestant. Sir Robert Walpole observed,
that a reduction of the army was the chief thing wished
for and desired by all the Jacobites in the kingdom; that
no reduction had ever been made but what gave fresh
hopes to that party, and encouraged them to raise tumults
against the government; and he did not doubt but that
if they should resolve to reduce any part of the army, there
would be post-horses employed that very night to carry
the good news beyond sea to the Pretender. His brother
Horatio added that the number of troops then proposed
was absolutely necessary to support his Majesty's govern∣ment,
and would be necessary as long as the nation en∣joyed
the happiness of having the present illustrious family
on the throne. The sutility, the self-contradiction, and
the ridiculous absurdity of these suggestions were properly
exposed; nevertheless, the army was voted without any
reduction. Sir Wilfred Lawson having made a motion
<PB N="478" REF="484"/>
for an address to the King, to know what satisfaction had
been made by Spain for the depredations committed on the
British merchants, it was after a violent debate approved,
and the address presented. The King, in answer to this
remonstrance, gave them to understand, that the meeting
of the commissaries of the two crowns had been so long de∣layed
by unforeseen accidents; that the conferences were not
opened till the latter end of the preceding February; and
that as the courts of London and Madrid had agreed that
the term of three years stipulated for finishing the commis∣sion
should be computed from their first meeting, a perfect
account of their proceedings could not as yet be laid before
the House of Commons. A bill had been long depending
for granting encouragement to the sugar colonies in the
West-Indies; but, as it was founded upon a prohibition
that would have put a stop to all commerce between the
French islands and the British settlements in North-Ame∣rica,
it met with a very warm opposition from those who
had the prosperity of those northern colonies at heart. But
the bill being patronised and supported by court interest,
surmounted all objections; and afterwards passed into a
law. While the Commons deliberated upon the supply,
Sir Robert Walpole moved, that five hundred thousand
pounds should be issued out of the sinking fund for the ser∣vice
of the ensuing year. Sir William Wyndham, Mr.
Pulteney, and Sir John Barnard, expatiated upon the ini∣quity
of pillaging a sacred deposit, solemnly appropriated
to the discharge of the national debt. They might have
demonstrated the egregious solly of a measure, by which
the publick, for a little temporary ease, lost the advantage
of the accumulating interest which would have arisen from
the sinking fund if properly managed and reserved. All
objections vanished before the powers of ministerial influ∣ence,
which nothing now could check but the immediate
danger of popular commotion. Such hazardous interposi∣tion
actually defeated a scheme which had been adopted
by the minister, and even before its appearance alarmed
all the trading part of the nation.</P>
<P><PB N="479" REF="485"/>
§ V. The House having resolved itself into a committee,
to deliberate upon the most proper methods for the better
security and improvement of the duties and revenues
charged upon tobacco and wines, all the papers relating
to these duties were submitted to the perusal of the mem∣bers:
the commissioners of the Customs and Excise were
ordered to attend the House, the avenues of which were
crowded with multitudes of people; and the members in
the opposition waited impatiently for a proposal, in which
they thought the liberties of their country so deeply in∣terested.
In a word, there had been a call of the House
on the preceding day. The session was frequent and
full; and both sides appeared ready and eager for the
contest, when Sir Robert Walpole broached his design.
He took notice of the arts which had been used to pre∣judice
the people against his plan before it was known.
He affirmed that the clamours occasioned by these preju∣dices
had originally risen from smugglers and fraudulent
dealers, who had enriched themselves by cheating the
publick; and that these had been strenuously assisted and
supported by another set of men, fond of every opportunity
to stir up the people of Great-Britain to mutiny and se∣dition.
He expatiated on the frauds that were committed
in that branch of the revenue arising from the duties on
tobacco; upon the hardships to which the American
planters were subjected by the heavy duties payable on
importation as well as by the ill usage they had met with
from their factors and correspondents in England, who,
from being their servants, were now become their masters;
upon the injury done to the fair trader; and the loss
sustained by the publick with respect to the revenue. He
asserted that the scheme he was about to propose would
remove all these inconveniencies, prevent numberless frauds,
perjuries, and false entries, and add two or three hundred
thousand pounds per annum to the publick revenue. He
entered into a long detail of frauds practised by the knavish
dealer in those commodities: he recited the several acts
of parliament that related to the duties on wine and
<PB N="480" REF="486"/>
tobacco: he declared he had no intention to promote a
general excise: he endeavoured to obviate some objections
that might be made to his plan, the nature of which he
at length explained. He proposed to join the laws of Ex∣cise
to those of the Customs: that the further subsidy of
three farthings per pound charged upon imported tobacco
should be still levied at the Custom-House, and payable
to his Majesty's civil-list as heretofore; that then the
tobacco should be lodged in warehouses, to be appointed
for that purpose by the commissioners of the Excise; that
the keeper of each warehouse, appointed likewise by the
commissioners, should have one lock and key, and the
merchant-importer have another; and that the tobacco
should be thus secured until the merchant should find vent
for it, either by exportation or home consumption; that
the part designed for exportation should be weighed at the
Custom-House, discharged of the three farthings per pound
which had been paid at its first importation, and then
exported without further trouble; that the portion destined
for home consumption should, in presence of the ware∣house-keeper,
be delivered to the purchaser, upon his pay∣ing
the inland duty of four pence per pound weight to
the proper officers appointed to receive it; by which means
the merchant would be cased of the inconvenience of pay∣ing
the duty upon importation, or of granting bonds and
finding sureties for the payment, before he had found a
market for the commodity; that all penalties and for∣feitures,
so far as they formerly belonged to the crown,
should for the future be applied to the use of the publick;
that appeals in this, as well as in all other cases relating to
the excise, should be heard and determined by two or three
of the judges, to be named by his Majesty; and in the
country, by the judge of assise upon the next circuit,
who should hear and determine such appeals in the most
summary manner, without the formality of proceedings in
courts of law or equity.</P>
<P>§ VI. Such was the substance of the famous excise
scheme, in favour of which Sir Robert Walpole moved,
<PB N="481" REF="487"/>
that the duties and subsidies on tobacco should from and
after the twenty-fourth day of June cease and determine.
The debate which ensued was managed and maintained by
all the able speakers on both sides of the question. Sir
Robert Walpole was answered by Mr. Perry, member for
the city of London. Sir Paul Methuen joined in the op∣position.
Sir John Barnard, another representative of
London, distinguished himself in the same cause. He was
supported by Mr. Pulteney, Sir William Wyndham, and
other patriots. The scheme was espoused by Sir Philip
Yorke, appointed lord-chief-justice of the King's-Bench,
and ennobled in the course of the ensuing year. Sir
Joseph Jekyl approved of the project, which was likewise
strenuously defended by Lord Hervey, Sir Thomas Robin∣son,
Sir William Yonge, Mr. Pelham, and Mr. Winning∣ton,
which last excelled all his contemporaries of the mini∣stry
in talents and address. Those who argued against the
scheme accused the minister of having misrepresented
the frauds, and made false calculations. With respect to
the supposed hardships under which the planters were said
to labour, they affirmed that no planter had ever dreamed
of complaining, until instigated by letters and applications
from London: that this scheme, far from relieving the
planters, would expose the factors to such grievous op∣pression,
that they would not be able to continue the
trade, consequently the planters would be entirely ruined;
and after all it would not prevent those frauds against
which it was said to be provided: that from the examina∣tion
of the commissioners of the Customs, it appeared
that those frauds did not exceed forty thousand pounds
per annum, and might in a great measure be abolished, by
a due execution of the laws in being; consequently this
scheme was unnecessary, would ineffectual in augment∣ing
the revenue, destructive to trade, and dangerous to
the liberties of the subject, as it tended to promote a
general excise, which was in all countries considered as a
grievous oppression. They suggested that it would pro∣duce
an additional swarm of excise-officers and warehouse-keepers,
<PB N="482" REF="488"/>
appointed and paid by the Treasury, so as to
multiply the dependents on the crown, and enable it still
further to influence the freedom of elections: that the
traders would become slaves to excisemen and ware∣house-keepers,
as they would be debarred all access to
their commodities, except at certain hours, when attended
by those officers: that the merchant, for every quantity of
tobacco he could fell, would be obliged to make a journey,
or send a messenger to the office for a permit, which could
not be obtained without trouble, expense, and delay: and
that should a law be enacted in consequence of this mo∣tion,
it would in all probability be some time or other used
as a precedent for introducing excise laws into every
branch of the revenue; in which case the liberty of Great-Britain
would be no more. In the course of this debate,
Sir Robert Walpole took notice of the multitudes which
had beset all the approaches to the House. He said it
would be an easy task for a designing seditious person to
raise a tumult and disorder among them: that gentlemen
might give them what name they should think sit, and
affirm they were come as humble suppliants; but he knew
whom the law called sturdy beggars; and those who
brought them to that place could not be certain but that
they might behave in the same manner. This insinuation
was resented by Sir John Barnard, who observed that mer∣chants
of character had a right to come down to the
Court of Requests, and lobby of the House of Commons,
in order to sollicit their friends and acquaintance against
any scheme or project which they might think prejudicial
to their commerce: that when he came into the House,
he saw none but such as deserved the appellation of sturdy
beggars as little as the honourable gentleman himself, or
any gentleman whatever.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1733.</NOTE> After a warm dispute the mo∣tion
was carried by a majority of sixty-one voices. Several
resolutions were sounded on the proposal; and to these the
House agreed, though not without another violent contest.
The resolutions produced a bill, against which petitions
were preferred by the lord-mayor, aldermen, and
<PB N="483" REF="489"/>
common council of London, the cities of Coventry and Not∣tingham.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. V. 1733.</NOTE>
A motion was made that counsel should be heard
for the city of London; but it was rejected by the ma∣jority,
and the petitions were ordered to lie upon the table.
Had the minister encountered no opposition but that which
appeared within doors, his project would have certainly
been carried into execution: but the whole nation was
alarmed, and clamoured loudly against the excise-bill.
The populace still crowded around Westminster-hall,
blocking up all the avenues to the House of Commons.
They even insulted the persons of those members who had
voted for the ministry on this occasion; and Sir Robert
Walpole began to be in fear of his life. He, therefore,
thought proper to drop the design, by moving that the
second reading of the bill might be postponed till the
twelfth day of June. Then complaint being made of the
insolence of the populace, who had maltreated several
members, divers resolutions were taken against those tu∣multuous
crowds, and their abettors: these resolves were
communicated to the lord-mayor of London, the sheriff of
Middlesex, and the high-bailiff of Westminster. Some
individuals were apprehended in the Court of Requests, as
having fomented the disturbances; but they were soon
released. The miscarriage of the bill was celebrated with
publick rejoicings in London and Westminster; and the
minister was burned in effigy by the populace. After the
miscarriage of the excise-scheme, the House unanimously
resolved to enquire into the frauds and abuses in the Cus∣toms;
and a committee of twenty-one persons was chosen
by ballot for this purpose.</P>
<P>§ VII. The subsequent debates of this session were oc∣casioned
by a bill to prevent the infamous practice of stock-jobbing,
which with great difficulty made its way to the
House of Lords, who proposed some amendments, in
consequence of which it was laid aside; and by another
bill establishing a lottery, to raise five hundred thousand
pounds for the relief of those who had suffered by the cha∣ritable
corporation. After having undergone some alter∣ations
<PB N="484" REF="490"/>
it passed through both Houses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK. II. 1733.</NOTE> and obtained the
royal assent. The King, by a message to parliament, had
signified his intention to give the Princess Royal in mar∣riage
to the Prince of Orange, promising himself their con∣currence
and assistance, that he might be enabled to bestow
such a portion with his eldest daughter as should be suitable
to the occasion. The Commons immediately resolved,
that out of the monies arising from the sale of lands in the
island of St. Christopher's his Majesty should be empower∣ed
to apply fourscore thousand pounds, as a marriage dower
for his daughter; and a clause for this purpose was inserted
in the bill, for enabling his Majesty to apply five hundred
thousand pounds out of the sinking fund for the service of
the current year.</P>
<P>§ VIII. The opposition in the House of Lords was still
more animated, though ineffectual. The debates chiefly
turned upon the pension-bill, the number of land forces,
and a motion made by Lord Bathurst, for an account
of the produce of the forfeited estates which had
belonged to the directors of the South-Sea company.
The trustees for these estates had charged themselves with
a great sum of money, and the lords in the opposition
thought they had a right to know how it had been dis∣posed.
The ministry had reasons to stisle this enquiry;
and, therefore, opposed it with all their vigour. Never∣theless,
the motion was carried, after a warm dispute, and
the directors of the South-Sea company were ordered to
lay the account before the House. From this, it appeared
that the large sums of money arising from the forfeited
estates had been distributed among the proprietors, by way
of dividend, even before recourse was had to parliament
for directions in what manner that produce should be ap∣plied:
Lord Bathurst, therefore, moved for a resolution of
the House, that the disposal of this money by way of dividend,
without any order or direction of a general court for that
purpose, was a violation of the act of parliament made for
the disposal thereof, and a manifest injustice done to the
proprietors of that stock. The Duke of Newcastle, in
<PB N="485" REF="491"/>
order to gain time, moved, that as the account was con∣fused,
and almost unintelligible, the present directors of
the company might be ordered to lay before the House a
further and more distinct account of the manner in which
the money had been disposed. A violent contest ensued,
in the course of which the House divided, and of fifty-seven
peers who voted for the delay, forty-six were such as en∣joyed
preferment in the church, commissions in the army,
or civil employments under the government. At length
Lord Bathurst waved his motion for that time: then the
House ordered that the present and former directors of the
South-Sea company, together with the late inspectors of
their accounts, should attend, and be examined. They
were accordingly interrogated, and gave so little satis∣faction,
that Lord Bathurst moved for a committee of en∣quiry;
but the question being put, was carried in the
negative: yet a very strong protest was entered by the
lords in the opposition. The next subject of altercation
was the bill for misapplying part of the produce of the
sinking-fund. It was attacked with all the force of argu∣ment,
wit, and declamation by the Earl of Stafford, Lords
Bathurst and Carteret, and particularly by the Earl of Che∣sterfield,
who had by this time resigned his staff of lord-stew∣ard
of the household, and renounced all connexion with the
ministry. Lord Bathurst moved for a resolution, importing
that, in the opinion of the House, the sinking-fund ought
for the future to be applied, in time of peace and publick
tranquillity, to the redemption of those taxes which were
most prejudicial to the trade, most burthensome on the
manufactures, and most oppressive on the poor of the
nation. This motion was over-ruled, and the bill adopted
by the majority. On the eleventh day of June, the King
gave the royal assent to the bills that were prepared, and
closed the session with a speech, in which he took notice
of the wicked endeavours that had been lately used to in∣flame
the minds of the people, by the most unjust misrepre∣sentations.</P>
<P><PB N="486" REF="492"/>
§ IX. Europe was now re-involved in fresh troubles, by
a vacancy on the throne of Poland. Augustus died at
Warsaw in the end of January, and the neighbouring
powers were immediately in commotion. The Elector of
Saxony, son to the late king, and Stanislaus, whose daugh∣ter
was married to the French monarch, declared them∣selves
candidates for the Polish throne. The Emperor,
the Czarina, and the King of Prussia espoused the interests
of the Saxon: the King of France supported the preten∣sions
of his father-in-law. The foreign ministers at War∣saw
forthwith began to form intrigues among the Electors;
the Marquis de Monti, ambassadour from France, exerted
himself so successfully, that he soon gained over the pri∣mate,
and a majority of the Catholick dietines, to the
interests of Stanislaus; while the Imperial and Russian
troops hovered on the frontiers of Poland. The French
King no sooner understood that a body of the Emperor's
forces was encamped in Silesia, than he ordered the Duke
of Berwick to assemble an army on the Rhine, and take
measures for entering Germany, in case the Imperiali<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
should march into Poland. A French fleet set sail for
Dantzick, while Stanislaus travelled through Germany in
disguise to Poland, and concealed himself in the house of
the French ambassadour at Warsaw. As the day of election
approached, the Imperial, Russian, and Prussian mini∣sters
delivered in their several declarations, by way of
protest against the contingent election of Stanislaus, as a
person proscribed, disqualified, depending upon a foreign
power, and connected with the Turks, and other infidels.
The Russian General Lasci entered Poland at the head of
fifty thousand men: the diet of the election was opened
with the usual ceremony on the twenty-fifth day of August.
Prince Viesazowiski, chief of the Saxon interest, retired
to the other side of the Vistula, with three thousand men▪
including some of the nobility who adhered to that party.
Nevertheless, the primate proceeded to the election: Stanis∣laus
was unanimously chosen king; and appeared in the
electoral field, where he was received with loud accla∣mation.
<PB N="487" REF="493"/>
The opposite party soon increased to ten thou∣sand
men; protested against the election, and joined the
Russian army, which advanced by speedy marches. King
Stanislaus finding himself unable to cope with such adver∣saries,
retired with the primate and French ambassadour to
Dantzick, leaving the Palatine of Kiow at Warsaw.
This general attacked the Saxon palace, which was sur∣rendered
upon terms: then the soldiers and inhabitants plun∣dered
the houses belonging to the grandees who had declar∣ed
for Augustus, as well as the hotel of the Russian minister.
In the mean time, the Poles, who had joined the Musco∣vites,
finding it impracticable to pass the Vistula before
the expiration of the time fixed for the session of the diet,
erected a kolo at Grocow, where the Elector of Saxony
was chosen and proclaimed, by the Bishop of Cracow,
King of Poland, under the name of Augustus III. on the
sixth day of October. They afterwards passed the river,
and the Palatine of Kiow retiring towards Cracow, they
took possession of Warsaw, where in their turn they plun∣dered
the palaces and houses belonging to the opposite
party.</P>
<P>§ X. During these transactions, the French King con∣cluded
a treaty with Spain and Sardinia, by which those
powers agreed to declare war against the Emperor. Mani∣festos
were published reciprocally by all the contracting
powers. The Duke of Berwick passed the Rhine in
October, and undertook the siege of fort Kehl, which in
a few days was surrendered on capitulation; then he re∣passed
the river, and returned to Versailles. The King
of Sardinia having declared war against the Emperor,
joined a body of French forces commanded by Mareschal
de Villars, and drove the Imperialists out of the Milanese.
His Imperial Majesty dreading the effects of such a power∣ful
confederacy against him, offered to compromise all
differences with the crown of Spain, under the mediation
of the King of Great-Britain; and Mr. Keene, the British
minister at Madrid, proposed an accommodation. Philip
expressed his acknowledgements to the King of England,
declaring, however, that the Emperor's advances were too
<PB N="488" REF="494"/>
late; and that his own resolutions were already taken.
Nevertheless, he sent orders to the Count de Montijo, his
ambassador at London, to communicate to his Britannick
Majesty the motives which had induced him to take these
resolutions. In the mean time, he detached a powerful
armament to Italy, where they invested the Imperial fortress
of Aula, the garrison of which were obliged to surrender
themselves prisoners of war. The republick of Venice de∣clared
she would take no share in the disputes of Italy;
the States-General signed a neutrality with the French King
for the Austrian Netherlands, without consulting the Em∣peror
or the King of Great-Britain; and the English coun∣cils
seemed to be altogether pacifick.</P>
<P>§ XI. In November the Prince of Orange arrived at
Greenwich, in order to espouse the Princess Royal; but
the marriage was postponed on account of his being taken
ill; and he repaired to Bath in Somersetshire, to drink
the waters for the recovery of his strength. Henrietta the
young Duchess of Marlborough dying about this time,
the title devolved to her sister's son, the Earl of Sunder∣land.
Lord King resigning his office of chancellor, it
was conferred upon Mr. Talbot, sollicitor-general, together
with the title of a baron; a promotion that reflected
honour upon those by whom it was advised. He possessed
the spirit of a Roman senator, the elegance of an Atticus,
and the integrity of a Cato. At the meeting of the parlia∣ment
in January, the King told them, in his speech,
that though he was no way engaged in the war which had
begun to rage in Europe, except by the good offices he
had employed among the contending powers, he could not
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> regardless of the present events, or be unconcerned for
the consequences of a war undertaken and supported by
such a powerful alliance. He said he had thought proper
to take time to examine the facts alledged on both sides,
and to wait the result of the councils of those powers that
were more immediately interested in the consequences of
the rupture. He declared he would concert with his
allies, more particularly with the States-General of the
<PB N="489" REF="495"/>
United Provinces, such measures as should be thought most
adviseable for their common safety, and for restoring the
peace of Europe. In the mean time, he expressed his hope
that they would make such provision as should secure his
kingdom, rights, and possessions from all dangers and in∣sults,
and maintain the respect due to the British nation.
He said, that whatever part it might in the end be most
reasonable for him to act, it would in all views be necessary,
when all Europe was preparing for arms, to put his king∣doms
in a posture of defence. The motion for an address
of thanks produced, as usual, a debate in both Houses,
which, it must be owned, appears to have proceeded from
a spirit of cavilling, rather than from any reasonable cause
of objection.</P>
<P>§ XII. The House of Commons resolved to address his
Majesty for a copy of the treaty of Vienna. Sir John
Rushout moved for another, desiring that the letters and
instructions relating to the execution of the treaty of
Seville should be submitted to the inspection of the Com∣mons;
but, after a hard struggle, it was over-ruled.
The next motion was made by Mr. Sandys, a gentleman
who had for some time appeared strenuous in the oppo∣sition,
and wrangled with great perseverance. He pro∣posed
that the House should examine the instructions which
had been given to the British minister in Poland, some
years before the death of King Augustus, that they might
be the better able to judge of the causes which produced
this new rupture among the powers of Europe. The
motion being opposed by all the court members, a contest
ensued, in the course of which Mr. Pultency compared
the ministry to an empyrick, and the constitution of Eng∣land
to his patient. “This pretender in physick (said he)
being consulted, tells the distempered person, there were
but two or three ways of treating his disease; and he was
afraid that none of them would succeed. A vomit might
throw him into convulsions that would occasion immediate
death; a purge might bring on a diarrhoea that would
carry him off in a short time; and he had been already
<PB N="490" REF="496"/>
bled so much, and so often, that he could bear it no longer.
The unfortunate patient shocked at this declaration, re∣plies,
“Sir, you have always pretended to be a regular
doctor, but I now find you are an arrant quack. I
had an excellent constitution when I first fell into
your hands, but you have quite destroyed it; and now
I find I have no other chance for saving my life, but
by calling for the help of some regular physician.” In
the debate, the members on both sides seemed to wander
from the question, and indulge themselves with ludicrous
personalities. Mr. H. Walpole took occasion to say, that
the opposition treated the ministry as he himself was treat∣ed
by some of his acquaintance, with respect to his dress.
“If I am in plain clothes (said he) then they call me a
slovenly, dirty fellow; and if by chance I wear a laced
suit, they cry, What, shall such an aukward fellow
wear fine clothes?” He continued to sport in this kind
of idle buffonery. He compared the present administra∣tion
to a ship at sea. As long as the wind was fair, and
proper for carrying us to our designed port, the word was
“Steady! steady!” but when the wind began to shift and
change, the word was necessarily altered to “Thus,
thus, and no near.” The motion was overpowered by
the majority; and this was the fate of several other propo∣sals
made by the members in the opposition. Sir John
Barnard presented a petition from the druggists, and other
dealers in tea, complaining of the insults and oppression
to which they were subjected by the excise laws, and im∣ploring
relief. Sir John and Mr. Perry, another of the city-members,
explained the grievous hardships which those
traders sustained, and moved that the petition might be re∣ferred
to the consideration of the whole House. They were
opposed by Mr. Winnington, Sir W. Yonge, and other
partisans of the ministry; and these skirmishes brought on
a general engagement of the two parties, in which every
weapon of satire, argument, reason, and truth was wield∣ed
against that odious, arbitrary, and oppressive method of
<PB N="491" REF="497"/>
collecting the publick revenue. Nevertheless, the motion
in favour of the sufferers was rejected.</P>
<P>§ XIII. When the Commons deliberated upon the sup∣ply,
Mr. Andrews, deputy-paymaster of the army, moved
for an addition of eighteen hundred men to the number of
land-forces which had been continued since the preceding
year. The members in the opposition disputed this small
augmentation with too much heat and eagerness. It must
be acknowledged, they were by this time irritated into such
personal animosity against the minister, that they resolved
to oppose all his measures, whether they might or might
not be necessary for the safety and advantage of the king∣dom.
Nor indeed were they altogether blameable for act∣ing
on this maxim, if their sole aim was to remove from
the confidence and councils of their sovereign a man
whose conduct they thought prejudicial to the interest and
liberties of their country. They could not, however,
prevent the augmentation proposed: but they resolved, if
they could not wholly stop the career of the ministry, to
throw in such a number of rubs as should at least retard
their progress. The Duke of Bolton and Lord Cobham
had been deprived of the regiments they commanded, be∣cause
they refused to concur in every project of the admi∣nistration.
It was in consequence of their dismission that
Lord Morpeth moved for a bill to prevent any commission-officer,
not above the rank of a colonel, from being re∣moved,
unless by a court-martial, or by address of either
House of parliament. Such an attack on the prerogative
might have succeeded in the latter part of the reign of the
first Charles; but at this juncture could not sail to mis∣carry:
yet it was sustained with great vigour and address.
When the proposal was set aside by the majority, Mr.
Sandys moved for an address to the King, desiring to know
who advised his Majesty to remove the Duke of Bolton
and Lord Cobham from their respective regiments. He
was seconded by Mr. Pulteney and Sir William Wynd∣ham:
but the ministry foreseeing another tedious dispute
called for the question, and the motion was carried in the
<PB N="492" REF="498"/>
negative. The next source of contention was a bill for
securing the freedom of parliament, by limiting the number
of officers in the House of Commons. It was read a first
and second time; but, when a motion was made for its
being committed, it met with a powerful opposition, and
produced a warm debate that issued in a question which,
like the former, passed in the negative. A clergyman
having insinuated in conversation, that Sir William Mil∣ner,
baronet, member for York, received a pension from
the ministry, the House took cognizance of this report:
the clergyman acknowledged at the bar that he might have
dropped such a hint from hearsay. The accused member
protested, upon his honour, that he never did, or ever
would receive, place, pension, gratuity, or reward from
the court, either directly or indirectly, for voting in parlia∣ment,
or upon any other account whatever. The accusa∣tion
was voted false and scandalous, and the accuser taken
into custody; but in a few days he was discharged upon
his humble petition, and his begging pardon of the mem∣ber
whom he had calumniated. The duty upon salt was
prolonged for eight years; and a bill passed against stock-jobbing.</P>
<P>§ XIV. But the subject which of all others employed
the eloquence and abilities on both sides to the most vigo∣rous
exertion, was a motion made by Mr. Bromley, who
proposed that a bill should be brought in for repealing the
septennial act, and for the more frequent meeting and
calling of parliaments. The arguments for and against
septennial parliaments have already been stated. The
ministry now insisted upon the increase of papists and
Jacobites, which rendered it dangerous to weaken the
hands of the government: they challenged the opposition to
produce one instance in which the least encroachment had
been made on the liberties of the people since the septennial
act took place; and they desied the most ingenious malice
to prove that his present Majesty had ever endeavoured to
extend any branch of the prerogative beyond its legal
bounds. Sir John Hinde Cotton affirmed, that in many
<PB N="493" REF="499"/>
parts of England the papists had already begun to use all
their influence in favour of those candidates who were re∣commended
by the ministers as members in the ensuing
parliament. With respect to his Majesty's conduct, he
said he would not answer one word; but as to the griev∣ances
introduced since the law was enacted for septennial
parliaments, he thought himself more at liberty to declare
his sentiments. He asserted that the septennial law itself
was an encroachment on the rights of the people; a law
passed by a parliament that made itself septennial. He
observed, that the laws of treason with regard to trials
were altered since that period: that in former times a man
was tried by a jury of his neighbours, within the country
where the crimes alledged against him were said to be com∣mitted;
but by an act of a septennial parliament he might be
removed and tried in any place where the crown, or rather
the ministry, could find a jury proper for their purpose;
where the prisoner could not bring any witness in his
justification, without an expense which perhaps his circum∣stances
would not bear. He asked if the riot act was not
an encroachment on the rights of the people? An act by
which a little dirty justice of the peace, the meanest and
vilest tool a minister can use, who perhaps subsits by his
being in the commission, and may be deprived of that sub∣sistence
at the pleasure of his patron, had it in his power
to put twenty or thirty of the best subjects in England to
immediate death, without any trial or form but that of
reading a proclamation. “Was not the fatal South-Sea
scheme (said he) established by the act of a septennial
parliament? And can any man ask, whether that law
was attended with any inconvenience? To the glorious
catalogue I might have added the late excise-bill, if it
had passed into a law; but, thank heaven, the septennial
parliament was near expiring before that famous measure
was introduced.”</P>
<P>§ XV. Sir William Wyndham concluded an excellent
speech, that spoke him the unrivalled orator, the uncor∣rupted
Briton, and the unshaken patriot, in words to this
<PB N="494" REF="500"/>
effect: “Let us suppose a man abandoned to all notions
of virtue and honour, of no great family, and but a
mean fortune, raised to be chief minister of state,
by the concurrence of many whimsical events; afraid,
or unwilling, to trust any but creatures of his own ma∣king;
lost to all sense of shame and reputation; igno∣rant
of his country's true interest; pursuing no aim but
that of aggrandizing himself and his favourites; in fo∣reign
affairs trusting none but those who, from the
nature of their education, cannot possibly be qualified
for the service of their country, or give weight and
credit to their negociations. Let us suppose the true
interest of the nation, by such means, neglected or
misunderstood, her honour tarnished, her importance
lost, her trade insulted, her merchants plundered, and
her sailors murthered; and all these circumstances over-looked,
lest his administration should be endangered.
Suppose him next possessed of immense wealth, the
plunder of the nation, with a parliament chiefly com∣posed
of members whose seats are purchased, and
whose votes are bought at the expense of the publick
treasure. In such a parliament, suppose all attempt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
made to enquire into his conduct, or to relieve the
nation from the distress which has been entailed upon
it by his administration. Suppose him screened by a
corrupt majority of his creatures, whom he retains in
daily pay, or engages in his particular interest, by di∣stributing
among them those posts and places which
ought never to be bestowed upon any but for the good
of the publick. Let him plume himself upon his
scandalous victory, because he has obtained a parliament
like a packed jury ready to acquit him at all adventures.
Let us suppose him domineering with insolence over all
the men of ancient families, over all the men of sense,
figure, or fortune in the nation: as he has no virtue
of his own, ridiculing it in others, and endeavouring
to destroy or corrupt it in all. With such a minister,
and such a parliament, let us suppose a case which I
<PB N="495" REF="501"/>
hope will never happen:<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. V. 1733.</NOTE> a prince upon the throne, un∣informed,
ignorant, and unacquainted with the incli∣nations
and true interest of his people, weak, capri∣cious,
transported with unbounded ambition, and pos∣sessed
with insatiable avarice. I hope such a case will
never occur; but, as it possibly may, could any greater
curse happen to a nation, than such a prince on the
throne, advised, and solely advised, by such a minister,
and that minister supported by such a parliament. The
nature of mankind cannot be altered by human laws:
the existence of such a prince or such a minister we
cannot prevent by act of parliament; but the existence
of such a parliament I think we may prevent; as it is
much more likely to exist, and may do more mischief
while the septennial law remains in force, than if it
were repealed; therefore, I am heartily for its being re∣pealed.”
Notwithstanding the most warm, the most
nervous, the most pathetick remonstrances in favour of
the motion, the question was put, and it was suppressed by
mere dint of number.</P>
<P>§ XVI. The triumph of the ministry was still more com∣plete
in the success of a message delivered from the crown
in the latter end of the session,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1734▪</NOTE> when a great many mem∣bers
of the other party had retired to their respective habi∣tations
in the country. Sir Robert Walpole delivered this
commission to the House, importing, that his Majesty
might be enabled to augment his sorces, if occasion should
require such an augmentation, between the dissolution of
this parliament and the election of another. Such an im∣portant
point, that was said to strike at the foundation of
our liberties, was not tamely yielded; but, on the contrary,
contested with uncommon ardour. The motion for taking
the message into consideration was carried in the affir∣mative;
and an address presented to the King, signifying
their compliance with his desire. In consequence of a
subsequent message, they prepared and passed a bill, ena∣bling
his Majesty to settle an annuity of five thousand
<PB N="496" REF="502"/>
pounds for life on the Princess Royal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1734.</NOTE> as a mark of his
paternal favour and affection.</P>
<P>§ XVII. The opposition in the House of Peers kept pace
with that in the House of Commons, and was supported
with equal abilities, under the auspices of the Lords
Bathurst and Carteret, the Earls of Chesterfield and Abing∣don.
The Duke of Marlborough made a motion for a
bill to regulate the army, equivalent to that which had
been rejected in the Lower House; and it met with the
same fate after a warm dispute. Then Lord Carteret
moved for an address to the King, that he would be gra∣ciously
pleased to acquaint the House who advised his Ma∣jesty
to remove the Duke of Bolton and Lord Viscount
Cobham from their respective regiments; and what crimes
were laid to their charge. This proposal was likewise
rejected, at the end of a debate in which the Duke of Ar∣gyle
observed, that two lords had been removed, but only
one soldier had lost his commission. Such a great majority
of the Scottish representatives had always voted for the
ministry since the accession of the late King; and so many
of these enjoyed places and preferments in the gift of the
crown, that several attempts were made by the lords in
the opposition, to prevent for the future the ministerial in∣fluence
from extending itself to the elections of North-Britain.
Accordingly, two motions for this purpose were
made by the Earl of Marchmont and the Duke of Bedford;
and sustained by the Earls of Chesterfield, Winchelsea,
and Stair, Lords Willoughby de Broke, Bathurst, and
Carteret. They were opposed by the Dukes of New∣castle
and Argyle, the Earl of Cholmondeley, Earl Paulet,
Lord Hervey, now called up by writ to the House of Peers,
and Lord Talbot. The question being put on both,
they were of course defeated; and the Earl of Stair was
deprived of his regiment of dragoons, after having per∣formed
the most signal services to the royal family, and ex∣hausted
his fortune in supporting the interests and dignity
of the crown. Strenuous protests were entered against the
decision of the majority concerning the King's message
<PB N="497" REF="503"/>
demanding a power to augment his forces during the re∣cess
of parliament;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. V. 1734.</NOTE> as also against a bill for enabling his
Majesty to apply the sum of one million two hundred
thousand pounds out of the sinking-fund, for the service
of the current year. The business of the session being
dispatched, the King repaired to the House of Lords on
the sixteenth day of April, and having passed all the bills
that were ready for the royal assent, took leave of this
parliament, with the warmest acknowledgement of their
zeal, duty, and affection. It was at first prorogued, then
dissolved, and another convoked by the same proclama∣tion.
On the fourteenth day of March, the nuptials of
the Prince of Orange and the Princess Royal were solemn∣ized
with great magnificence; and this match was at∣tended
with addresses of congratulation to his Majesty from
different parts of the kingdom.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. The powers at war upon the continent
acted with surprising vigour. The Russian and Saxon
army invested the city of Dantzick, in hopes of securing
the person of King Stanislaus. The town was strong,
the garrison numerous, and, animated by the examples of
the French and Poles, made a very obstinate defence. For
some time they were supplied by sea with recruits, arms,
and ammunition. On the eleventh day of May a re-en∣forcement
of fifteen hundred men was landed from two
French ships of war and some transports, under Fort
Wechselmunde, which was so much in want of provi∣sions,
that they were not admitted: they, therefore, re-em∣barked,
and sailed back to Copenhagen. But afterwards
a larger number were landed in the same place, and at∣tacked
the Russian entrenchments, in order to force their
way into the city. They were repulsed in this attempt,
but retired in good order. At length the Russian sleet
arrived, under the command of Admiral Gordon; and
now the siege was carried on with great fury. Fort Wech∣selmunde
was surrendered: the French troops capitulated,
and were embarked in the Russian ships, to be conveyed
to some port in the Baltick. Stanislaus escaped in the dis∣guise
<PB N="498" REF="504"/>
of a peasant to Marienwarder in the Prussian terri∣tories.
The city of Dantzick submitted to the dominion
of Augustus III. King of Poland, and was obliged to de∣fray
the expense of the war to the Russian General Count
de Munich, who had assumed the command after the siege
was begun. The Polish lords at Dantzick signed an
act of submission to King Augustus, who, on the tenth
day of July, arrived at the convent of Oliva. There a
council was held in his presence. The recusant noblemen
took the oath which he proposed. Then a general amnesty
was proclaimed; and the King set out on his return to
Dresden.</P>
<P>§ XIX. On the Rhine the French arms bore down all
resistance. The Count de Belleisle besieged and took
Traerbach. The Duke of Berwick, at the head of sixty
thousand men, invested Philipsburgh, while Prince Eugene
was obliged to remain on the defensive, in the strong camp
at Heilbron, waiting for the troops of the empire. On
the twelfth day of June, the Duke of Berwick, in visiting
the trenches, was killed by a cannon-ball, and the com∣mand
devolved upon the Marquis d'Asfeldt, who carried
on the operations of the siege with equal vigour and capa∣city.
Prince Eugene, being joined by the different re-en∣forcements
he expected, marched towards the French
lines; but found them so strong, that he would not hazard
an attack; and such precautions taken, that with all his
military talents he could not relieve the besieged. At
length General Watgenau, the governour, capitulated, after
having made a noble defence, and obtained the most honour∣able
conditions. Prince Eugene retired to Heidelberg; and
the campaign ended about the beginning of October.
The Imperial arms were not more successful in Italy.
The Infant Don Carlos had received so many invitations
from the Neapolitan nobility, that he resolved to take
possession of that kingdom. He began his march in Febru∣ary,
at the head of the Spanish forces; published a mani∣festo,
declaring he was sent by his father to relieve the
kingdom of Naples from the oppression under which it
<PB N="499" REF="505"/>
groaned; and entered the capital amidst the acclamations
of the people; while the Count de Viscomti, the German
viceroy, finding himself unable to cope with the invaders,
thought proper to retire, after having thrown succours
into Gaeta and Capua. When he arrived at Nocera, he
began to assemble the militia, with intent to form a camp
at Barletta. The Count de Montemar marched with a
body of forces against this general, and obtained over him
a complete victory at Bitonto in Apuglia, on the twenty-fifth
of May, when the Imperialists were entirely routed,
and a great number of principal officers taken prisoners.
Don Carlos being proclaimed, and acknowledged King of
Naples, created the Count de Montemar Duke of Bitonto;
reduced Gaeta, and all other parts of the kingdom
which were garrisoned with Imperial troops; and resolved
to subdue the island of Sicily. About twenty thousand
troops being destined for this expedition were landed in
the road of Solanto in August, under the command of the
new Duke of Bitonto, who being favoured by the natives,
proceeded in his conquests with great rapidity. The people
acknowledged Don Carlos as their sovereign, and took
arms in support of his government; so that the Imperial
troops were driven before them, and the Spaniards pos∣sessed
the whole kingdom, except Messina, Syracuse, and
Trepani, when the Infant determined to visit the island in
person.</P>
<P>§ XX. While Don Carlos was thus employed in the
conquest of Naples and Sicily, the Imperialists were hard
pressed in Lombardy by the united forces of France and
Piedmont, commanded by the King of Sardinia and the
old Mareschal Duke de Villars. In the month of Janu∣ary
they undertook the siege of Tortona, which they re∣duced;
while the troops of the Emperor began to pour in
great numbers into the Mantuan. In the beginning of
May, Count Merci, who commanded them, passed the
Po in the face of the allies, notwithstanding all the skill of
Villars, obliged him to retreat from the banks of that
river, and took the castle of Colorno. The old French
<PB N="500" REF="506"/>
general being taken ill, quitted the army, and retired to
Turin, where in a little time he died; and the King of
Sardinia retiring to the same place, the command of the
allied forces devolved upon the Mareschal de Coigny.
The confederates were posted at Sanguina, and the Im∣perialists
at Sorbola, when the Count de Merci made a
motion to San Prospero, as if he intended either to attack
the enemy, or take possession of Parma. The Mareschal
de Coigny forthwith made a disposition for an engagement;
and, on the twenty-ninth day of June, the Imperial gene∣ral
having passed the Parma, began the attack with great
impetuosity. He charged in person at the head of his troops
and was killed soon after the battle began. Nevertheless,
the Prince of Wirtemberg assuming the command, both
armies fought with great obstinacy, from eleven in the
forenoon till four in the afternoon, when the Imperialists
retired towards Monte Cirugalo, leaving five thousand
men dead on the field of battle, and among these many
officers of distinction. The loss of the allies was very
considerable, and they reaped no solid fruits from their
victory.</P>
<P>§ XXI. The Imperial forces retreated to Reggio, and
from thence moved to the plains of Carpi, on the right of
the Secchia, where they received some re-enforcements:
then General Count Konigsegg arriving in the camp, took
upon himself the command of the army. His first step
was to take post at Quingentolo, by which motion
he secured Mirandola, that was threatened with a siege.
On the fifteenth of February he sorded the river Secchia,
and surprised the quarters of Mareschal de Broglio, who
escaped in his shirt with great difficulty. The French
retired with such precipitation, that they left all their
baggage behind, and above two thousand were taken pri∣soners.
They posted themselves under Guastalla, where,
on the nineteenth day of the month, they were vigorously
attacked by the Imperialists, and a general engagement
ensued. Konigsegg made several desperate efforts to break
the French cavalry, upon which, however, he could
<PB N="501" REF="507"/>
make no impression. The infantry on both sides fought
with uncommon ardour for six hours, and the field was
covered with carnage. At length the Imperial general
retreated to Lazara, after having lost above five thousand
men, including the Prince of Wirtemberg, the Generals
Valpareze and Colminero, with many other officers of
distinction: nor was the damage sustained by the French
greatly inferior to that of the Germans, who repassed the
Po, and took post on the Banks of the Oglio. The allies
crossed the same river, and the Marquis de Maillebois was
sent with a detachment to attack Mirandola; but the Im∣perialists
marching to the relief of the place, compelled
him to abandon the enterprise: then he rejoined his army,
which retired under the walls of Cremona, to wait for
succours from Don Carlos. So little respect did the
French court pay to the British nation, at this juncture,
that in the month of November an edict was published in
Paris, commanding all the British subjects in France,
who were not actually in employment, from the age of
eighteen to fifty, to quit the kingdom in fifteen days,
or inlist in some of the Irish regiments, on pain of being
treated as vagabonds, and sent to the gallies. This edict
was executed with the utmost rigour. The prisons of
Paris were crouded with the subjects of Great-Britain,
who were surprised and cut off from all communication
with their friends, and must have perished by cold and
hunger, had not they been relieved by the active charity of
the Jansenists. The Earl of Waldegrave, who then re∣sided
at Paris as ambassadour from the King of Great-Britain,
made such vigorous remonstrances to the
French ministry, upon this unheard of outrage against a
nation with which they had been so long in alliance, that
they thought proper to set the prisoners at liberty, and
publish another edict, by which the meaning of the former
was explained away.</P>
<P>§ XXII. While these transactions occurred on the con∣tinent,
the King of Great-Britain augmented his land-forces;
and warm contests were maintained through the
<PB N="502" REF="508"/>
whole united kingdom in electing representatives for the
new parliament. But in all these struggles the ministerial
power predominated; and the new members appeared with
the old complexion. The two Houses assembled on the
fourteenth day of January, and Mr. Onslow was re-elected
Speaker. The leaders of both parties in all debates were
the self-same persons who had conducted those of the former
parliament; and the same measures were pursued in the
same manner. The King, in his speech at the opening
of the session, gave them to understand, that he had con∣certed
with the States-General of the United Provinces
such measures as were thought most adviseable for their
common safety, and for restoring the peace of Europe:
that they had considered on one side the pressing applications
made by the Imperial court both in England and Holland,
for obtaining succours against the powers at war with the
house of Austria; and on the other side, the repeated pro∣fessions
made by the allies, of their sincere disposition to
put an end to the present troubles upon honourable and
solid terms: that he and the States-General had concurred
in a resolution to employ their joint and earnest instances to
bring matters to a speedy and happy accommodation:
that their good offices were at length accepted; and in a
short time a plan would be offered to the consideration of
all parties engaged in the war, as a basis for a general ne∣gociation
of peace. He told them he had used the power
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ested in him by the last parliament with great moderation;
and concluded a treaty with the crown of Denmark of great
importance in the present conjuncture. He observed,
that whilst many of the principal powers of Europe were
actually engaged in a war, Great-Britain must be more or
less affected with the consequences; and as the best con∣certed
measures are liable to uncertainty, the nation ought
to be prepared against all events. He, therefore, expressed
his hope, that his good subjects would not repine at the
necessary means of procuring the blessings of peace and
universal tranquillity, or of putting him in a condition to
act that part which it might be necessary and incumbent
<PB N="503" REF="509"/>
upon him to take. The address of thanks produced a
dispute as usual, which ended with an acquiescence in the
motion. The House, in a grand committee on the supply,
resolved, That thirty thousand seamen should be employed
for the service of the ensuing year; and, That the land-forces
should be augmented to the number of twenty-five
thousand seven hundred and forty-four effective men.
But these resolutions were not taken without dispute and
division. The minister's opponents not only re-produced
all the reasons which had been formerly advanced against a
standing army, but they opposed this augmentation with
extraordinary ardour, as a huge stride towards the esta∣blishment
of arbitrary power. They refuted those fears of
external broils on which the ministry pretended to ground
the necessity of such an augmentation; and they exposed
the weak conduct of the administration, in having con∣tributed
to destroy the balance of power, by assisting Spain
against the Emperor in Italy, so as to aggrandize the House
of Bourbon.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. Sir William Wyndham moved, that the
estimate of the navy for the ensuing year might be referred
to a select committee. He expressed his surprise, that
notwithstanding the vast sums which had been yearly
raised, and the long continuance of the peace, the people
had not been quite delivered of any one tax incurred in the
preceding war. He said, he could not comprehend how
it was possible to find pretences for exposing the nation to
such exorbitant charges; and he took notice of some un∣conscionable
articles in the accounts of the navy-debt that
lay upon the table. He was seconded by Mr. Sandys,
and supported by Sir Joseph Jekyll and Mr. Pulteney;
but after some debate the motion was carried in the nega∣tive.
When the new treaty with Denmark fell under
consideration in a grand committee, Mr. H. Walpole
moved, that the sum of fifty-six thousand two hundred and
fifty pounds should be granted to his Majesty, as a subsidy
to the Dane, pursuant to the said treaty, for the service of
the ensuing year. The demand did not meet with imme∣diate
<PB N="504" REF="510"/>
compliance. All the leaders in the opposition ex∣claimed
against the subsidy as unnecessary and unreasonable.
They observed, that as the English had no particular in∣terest
of their own for inducing them to engage in the
present war, but only the danger to which the balance of
power might be exposed by that event; and as all the
powers of Europe were as much, if not more, interested
than the English in the preservation of that balance,
should it ever be really endangered, they would certainly
engage in its defence, without receiving any valuable con∣sideration
from Great-Britain; but, should the English be
always the first to take the alarm upon any rupture, and
offer bribes and pensions to all the princes in Europe, the
whole charge of preserving that balance would fall upon
Great-Britain: every state would expect a gratification
from her, for doing that which it would otherwise be obli∣ged
to do for its own preservation: even the Dutch might
at last refuse to assist in trimming this balance, unless Bri∣tain
should submit to make the Grand Pensionary of Hol∣land
a pensionary of England, and take a number of their
forces into English pay. The debate having had its free
course, the question was put, and the motion approved by
the majority. The ministry allowed a bill to be brought
in for limiting the number of officers in the House of Com∣mons;
but at the second reading it was rejected upon a
division, after a learned debate, in which it appeared that
the opposition had gained a valuable auxiliary in the person
of Lord Polwarth, son to the Earl of Marchmont, a noble∣man
of elegant parts, keen penetration, and uncommon
vivacity, who spoke with all the fluency and fervour of
elo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ution.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. The minority in the House of Lords were not
less vigilant and resolute in detecting and opposing every
measure which they thought would redound to the prejudice
of their country. But the most remarkable object that em∣ployed
their attention during this session was a very extraordi∣nary
petition, subscribed by the Dukes of Hamilton, Queens∣berry,
and Montrose, the Earls of Dundonald, Marchmont▪
<PB N="505" REF="511"/>
and Stair, representing, that undue influence had been used
for carrying on the election of the sixteen peers for Scot∣land.
The Duke of Bedford, who delivered their petition
to the House, proposed a day for taking it into consider∣ation;
and to this they agreed. It was afterwards moved,
that the consideration of it should be adjourned to a short
day, before which the petitioners should be ordered to de∣clare
whether they intended to controvert the last election
of all the sixteen peers, or the election of any, and which
of them. This affair was of such an unprecedented nature,
that the House seemed to be divided in opinion about the
manner in which they ought to proceed. The partisans
of the ministry would have willingly stifled the enquiry in
the beginning; but the petitioners were so str<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nuously
supported in their claim to some notice, by the Earls of
Chesterfield, Abingdon, and Strafford, the Lords Bathurst
and Carteret, that they could not dismiss it at once with
any regard to decorum. The order of the House, accord∣ing
to the motion explained above, being communicated by
the Lord-Chancellor to the petitioners, they waited on
him with a declaration, importing, that they did not intend
to controvert the election or return of the sixteen peers for
Scotland; but they thought it their duty to lay before their
lordships the evidance of such facts and undue methods as
appeared to them to be dangerous to the constitution; and
might in future elections equally affect the right of the
present sixteen peers, as that of the other peers of Scot∣land,
if not prevented by a proper remedy. This decla∣ration
being repeated to the House, the Duke of Devon∣shire
made a motion, that the petitioners might be ordered
to lay before the House in writing instances of those undue
methods and illegal practices upon which they intended
to proceed, and the names of the persons they suspected to
be guilty. He was warmly opposed by the country party;
and a long debate ensued, after which the question was
carried in favour of the motion, and the order signified to
the petitioners. Next day their answer was read to the
House to this effect: That as they had no intention to
state themselves accusers, they could not take upon them
<PB N="506" REF="512"/>
to name particular persons who might have been concerned
in those illegal practices; but who they were would un∣doubtedly
appear to their lordships upon their taking the
proper examinations; nevertheless, they did humbly ac∣quaint
their lordships, that the petition was laid before
them upon information that the list of the sixteen peers
for Scotland had been framed previous to the election, by
persons in high trust under the crown: that this list was
shown to peers, as a list approved by the crown;
and was called the King's list, from which there was to be
no variation, unless to make way for one or two particular
peers, on condition they should conform to measures:
that peers were sollicited to vote for this list, without the
liberty of making any alteration: that endeavours were
used to engage peers to vote for this list by promise of
pensions, and offices civil and military to themselves and
relations, as well as by offers of money: that sums were
given for this purpose: that pensions, offices, and releases
of debts owing to the crown were actually granted to
peers who concurred in voting for this list, and to their
relations: that on the day of election a battalion of his
Majesty's troops was drawn up in the abbey-court of Edin∣burgh,
contrary to custom, and without any apparent cause
but that of overawing the electors. This answer gave rise
to another violent dispute; but the majority voted it unsa∣tisfactory,
and the petition was rejected, though the reso∣lution
was clogged with a vigorous protest.</P>
<P>§ XXV. Notwithstanding this discouragement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1735.</NOTE> the Earl
of Abingdon moved, That although the petition was dis∣missed,
an enquiry might be set on foot touching an af∣fair
of such consequence to the liberties of the kingdom.
The Earl of Ilay declaring his belief, that no such illegal
methods had been practised, the other produced a pamphlet,
intituled, The protests of a great number of noble lords,
entered by them at the last election of peers for Scotland.
Exceptions being taken to a pamphlet, as an object un∣worthy
of their notice, Lord Bathurst exhibited an authen∣tick
copy of those protests, extracted from the journal of that
election, signed by the two principal clerks, and witnessed
<PB N="507" REF="513"/>
by two gentlemen then attending in the lobby.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. V. 1735.</NOTE> These
were accordingly read, and plainly demonstrated the truth
of the allegations contained in the petition. Nothing
could be more scandalous, arrogant, and shamefully
flagrant than the conduct and deportment of those who
acted the part of understrappers to the ministry on this
occasion. But all this demonstration, adorned and en∣forced
by the charms and energy of eloquence, was like
preaching in a desert. A motion was made for adjourning,
and carried in the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>irmative: a protest was entered, and
the whole affair consigned to oblivion. Divers other
motions were made successively by the lords in the oppo∣sition,
and rejected by the invincible power of a majority.
The uninterrupted success of the ministry did not, how∣ever,
prevent them from renewing the struggle as often as
an opportunity offered. They disputed the continuation
of the salt-tax, and the bill for enabling the King to apply
the sum of one million out of the sinking fund for the
service of the current year, though success did not attend
their endeavours. They supported with all their might
a bill sent up from the Commons, explaining and amend∣ing
an act of the Scottish parliament, for preventing
wronguous imprisonment, and against undue delays in
trials. This was all the natives of Scotland had in lieu
of the Habeas Corpus act; though it did not screen them
from oppression. Yet the Earl of Ilay undertook to prove
they were on a sooting with their neighbours of England
in this respect; and the bill was thrown out on a division.
The session was closed on the fifteenth of May, when the
King, in his speech to both Houses declared, that the plan
of pacification concerted between him and the States-Ge∣neral
had not produced the desired effect. He thanked the
Commons for the supplies they had granted with such
chearfulness and dispatch. He signified his intention to
visit his German dominions; and told them he should
constitute the Queen regent of the realm in his absence.
Immediately after the prorogation his Majesty embarked
for Holland, in his way to Hanover.</P>
<P><PB N="508" REF="514"/>
§ XXVI. By this time the good understanding between
the courts of Madrid and Lisbon was destroyed by a re∣markable
incident.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1735.</NOTE> The Portuguese ambassador at Ma∣drid
having allowed his servants to rescue a criminal from
the officers of justice, all the servants concerned in that
rescue were dragged from his house to prison, by the Spanish
King's order, with circumstances of rigour and disgrace.
His Portuguese Majesty being informed of this outrage,
ordered reprisals to be made upon the servants of the Spa∣nish
ambassadour in Lisbon. The two ministers withdrew
abruptly to their respective courts. The two mo∣narchs
expressed their mutual resentment. The King
of Spain assembled a body of troops on the frontiers of
Portugal; and his Portuguese Majesty had recourse to the
assistance of King George. Don Marcos Antonio d'Alze∣veda
was dispatched to London, with the character of envoy
extraordinary; and succeeded in his commission according
to his wish. In a little time after the King's departure
from England, Sir John Norris sailed from Spithead with
a powerful squadron, in order to protect the Portuguese
against the Spaniards; and on the ninth day of June ar∣rived
at Lisbon, where he was welcomed as a deliverer.
Mr. Keene, the British envoy at the court of Spain, had
communicated to his Catholick Majesty the resolution of
his master to send a powerful squadron to Lisbon, with
orders to guard that coast from insults, and secure the
Brazil fleet, in which the merchants of Great-Britain were
deeply interested. Don Joseph Patinho, minister of his
Catholick Majesty, delivered a memorial to Mr. Keene,
representing, that such an expedition would affect the
commerce of Spain, by intimidating foreign merchants
from embarking their merchandise in the slota. But, in
all probability, it prevented a rupture between the two
crowns, and disposed the King of Spain to listen to terms
of accommodation.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. The powers in alliance against the House of
Austria having rejected the plan of pacification concerted
by the King of Great-Britain and the States-General,
<PB N="509" REF="515"/>
Mr. Walpole, ambassador at the Hague, presented a memo∣rial
to their high mightinesses, desiring they would, without
loss of time, put themselves in a posture of defence, by an
augmentation of their forces at sea and land, that they
might take such vigorous steps, in concert with Great-Britain,
as the future conjuncture of affairs might require.
But, before they would subject themselves to such expense,
they resolved to make further trial of their influence
with the powers in alliance against the Emperor; and con∣ferences
were renewed with the ministers of those allies.
The affairs of Poland became more and more unfavourable
to the interest of Stanislaus; for though a great number
of the Polish nobility engaged in a confederacy to support
his claim, and made repeated efforts in his behalf, the
Palatine of Kiow submitted to Augustus; and even his
brother the primate, after having sustained a long impri∣sonment,
and many extraordinary hardships, was obliged
to acknowledge that prince his sovereign. In Italy the
arms of the allies still continued to prosper. Don Carlos
landed in Sicily, and reduced the whole island, almost
without opposition; while the Imperialists were forced to
abandon all the territories they possessed in Italy, except
the Mantuan. The Emperor being equally unable to cope
with the French armies on the Rhine, implored succours
of the Czarina, who sent thirty thousand men to his assist∣ance.
This vigorous interposition, and the success of
Augustus in Poland, disposed the court of Versailles to a
pacification. A secret negociation was begun between
France and the House of Austria; and the preliminaries
were signed without the conc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrence or knowledge of
Spain, Sardinia, and the maritime powers. In these arti∣cles
it was stipulated, That France should restore all the
conquests she had made in Germany: That the reversion
of the dukedom of Tuscany should be vested in the Duke
of Lorraine: Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Lorraine should be allotted to King
Stanislaus; and after his death be united to the crown of
France: That the Emperor should possess the Milanese,
the Mantuan, and Parma: That the King of Sardinia
<PB N="510" REF="516"/>
should enjoy Vigevano and Novara: That Don Carlos
should be acknowledged King of Naples and Sicily, and
retain the island of Elba, with all the Spanish territories on
the coast of Tuscany; and that France should guarantee
the pragmatick sanction.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. The King of Great-Britain returned from
Hanover to England in the month of November; and on
the fifteenth day of January opened the session of parlia∣ment.
On this occasion he congratulated them on the
near prospect of a general peace in Europe, in consequence
of the preliminary articles to which the Emperor and the
King of France had agreed; and of which he had ex∣pressed
his approbation, as they did not differ in any
essential point from the plan of pacification which he and
the States-General had offered to the belligerent powers.
He told them that he had already ordered a considerable
reduction to be made in his forces both by sea and land;
but at the same time observed it would be necessary to
continue some extraordinary expense, until a more perfect
reconciliation should be established among the several
powers of Europe. An address of thanks was unani∣mously
voted, presented, and graciously received. After
the House had received several petitions from different
counties and gentlemen, complaining of undue influence
in elections for members of parliament, it proceeded to
consider of the supply, and Sir Charles Wager moving
that fifteen thousand seamen should be employed for the
service of the ensuing year, the proposal was approved
without opposition. But this was not the case with a
motion made by Mr. Pulteney, “That the ordinary esti∣mate
of the navy should be referred to a select com∣mittee.”
The ministry discouraged all such prying
measures: a debate was produced, the House divided, and
the motion was rejected. Such was the fate of a motion
for raising the supplies within the year, made by Mr.
Sandys, and supported by Sir John Barnard, Mr. Willi∣mot,
and other patriots, who demonstrated, that this was
a speedy and practicable expedient for discharging the
<PB N="511" REF="517"/>
national debt, lowering the interest of money, reducing
the price of labour, and encouraging a spirit of com∣merce.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. The bill for limiting the number of officers in
the House of Commons was again revived. The King
was empowered to borrow six hundred thousand pounds,
chargeable on the sinking fund, for the service of the en∣suing
year, though this power was not easily granted; and
the House resolved to lay a duty of twenty shillings per
gallon on all spirituous liquors, after it had appeared to
the committee appointed for that purpose that those spirits
were pernicious to the health and morals of the people.
To this resolution was added another, which amounted to
a total prohibition, namely, that fifty pounds should be
yearly paid to his Majesty for a license to be annually
taken out by every person who should vend, barter, or
utter any such spirituous liquors. Mr. Walter Plumer,
in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> concerted speech, moved for the repeal of some
cla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es in the test act: these he represented as a species of
persecution in which protestant dissenters were confounded
with the Roman catholicks and enemies to the establish∣ment.
He was sustained by Lord Polwarth and Mr.
Heathcote; but Sir Robert Walpole was joined by Mr.
Shippen against the motion as dangerous to the established
church: and the question being put, it was carried in the
negative.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1736.</NOTE> When Sir Joseph Jekyll presented to the House,
according to order, a bill founded on the resolutions they
had taken against spirituous liquors, Sir Robert Walpole
acquainted them, by his Majesty's command, that as the
alterations proposed to be made by that bill in the duties
charged upon all spirituous liquors might in a great degree
affect some part of the civil-list revenues, his Majesty, for
the sake of remedying so great an evil as was intended by
that bill to be prevented, did consent to accept any other
revenue of equal value, to be settled and appropriated in
lieu of his interest in the said duties. The bill was read a
second time, and consigned to a committee of the whole
House; but that for limiting the number of officers in the
<PB N="512" REF="518"/>
House of Commons was thrown out at the second read∣ing.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1736.</NOTE>
Petitions against the bill touching the retail of spi∣rituous
liquors were presented by the traders to the British
sugar colonies, by the merchants of Bristol and Liverpool,
representing the hardships to which they would be exposed
by a law which amounted to a prohibition of rum and spi∣rits
distilled from melasses. In consequence of these re∣monstrances,
a mitigating clause was inserted, in favour
of the composition known by the name of punch; and
distillers were permitted to exercise any other employment.
The sum of seventy thousand pounds was voted for making
good the deficiencies that might happen in the civil-list by
this bill, which at length passed through the House, though
not without reiterated disputes and warm altercation.
Violent opposition was likewise made to a bill for the re∣lief
of the people called quakers, who offered a petition,
representing, that though from motives of conscience they
refused the payment of tithes, church-rates, oblations, and
ecclesiastical dues, they were exposed to grievous sufferings
by prosecution in the Exchequer, eccelesiastical, and other
courts, to the imprisonment of their persons, and the
ruin of them and their families. A bill being prepared
for their relief, was read and printed: then petitions were
preferred against it by the clergy of Middlesex, and of
many other parts of the kingdom. Counsel was heard in
behalf of these petitioners, and several alterations proposed
in the bill, which after long repeated debates surmounted
all opposition, and was sent up to the lords.</P>
<P>§ XXX. In the month of February the King had sent
two members of the privy-council to the Prince of Wales,
with a message, proposing a marriage between his royal
highness and the Princess of Saxegotha. The proposal
being agreeable to the Prince, the marriage was celebrated
on the twenty-seventh day of April. Upon this occasion
Mr. Pulteney moved for an address of congratulation to
his Majesty, and was supported by Mr. George Lyttelton
and Mr. William Pitt, who seised this opportunity of
<PB N="513" REF="519"/>
pronouncing elegant panegyricks on the Prince of Wales
and his amiable consort.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. V. 1736.</NOTE> These two young members soon
distinguished themselves in the House by their eloquence
and superior talents. The attention of the House was
afterwards converted to a bill for the preventing of smug∣gling;
and another for explaining the act for the more
effectual preventing bribery and corruption in the election of
members to serve in parliament. Both made their way
through the Lower House, and were sent up to the Lords for
their concurrence. The number of land-forces voted for the
service of the current year was reduced to seventeen thousand
seven hundred and four effective men. The supplies were
raised by the malt-tax and land-tax, at two shillings in the
pound, additional duties on mum, cyder, and perry, stamped
vellum, parchment, and paper; and by an act empowering
his Majesty to borrow six hundred thousand pounds of the
sinking fund. In this session the parliament repealed the old
statutes of England and Scotland against conjuration,
witchcraft, and dealing with evil spirits. The Commons
likewise prepared a bill to restrain the disposition of lands in
mortmain, whereby they became unalienable. Against this
measure petitions were presented by the two universities,
the colleges of Eton, Winchester, and Westminster, and
divers hospitals that subsisted by charitable donations. In
favour of the universities and colleges a particular exempt∣ing
clause was inserted. Several other amendments were
made in the bill, which passed through both Houses, and
obtained the royal assent. Among the acts passed in this
session, was one for naturalising her Royal Highness the
Princess of Wales; and another for building a bridge
across the Thames from New-Palace-yard, in the city
of Westminster, to the opposite shore in the county of
Surrey. The points chiefly debated in the House of Lords
were the address of thanks for his Majesty's speech, the
mortmain bill, the Quakers bill, which was thrown out,
and that for the prevention of smuggling, which did not
pass without division and protest. On the twentieth day
of May the King closed the session with a speech, in which
<PB N="514" REF="520"/>
he told both Houses that a further convention touching the
execution of the preliminaries had been made and commu∣nicated
to him by the Emperor and Most Christian King:
and that negociations were carrying on by the several powers
engaged in the late war, in order to settle a general pacifi∣cation.
He expressed great concern at seeing such deeds
of dissatisfaction sown among his people: he protested it
was his desire, and should be his care, to preserve the pre∣sent
constitution in church and state, as by law established:
he recommended harmony and mutual affection among
all protestants of the nation, as the great security of that
happy establishment; and signified his intention to visit
his German dominions. Accordingly, the parliament was
no sooner prorogued than he set out for Hanover, after
having appointed the Queen regent in his absence.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. Such a degree of licentiousness prevailed over
the whole nation, that the kingdom was filled with tumult
and riots, which might have been prevented by proper
regulations of the civil government in a due execution of
the laws. The most remarkable of these disturbances
happened at Edinburgh, on the seventh day of September.
John Porteous, who commanded the guard paid by that
city, a man of brutal disposition and abandoned morals,
had at the execution of a smuggler been provoked by some
insults from the populace to order his men, without using
the previous formalities of the law, to fire with shot among
the crowd; by which precipitate order several innocent per∣sons
lost their lives. Porteous was tried for murther, con∣victed,
and received sentence of death; but the Queen, as
guardian of the realm, thought proper to indulge him
with a reprieve. The common people of Edinburgh re∣sented
this lenity shown to a criminal who was the object
of their detestation. They remembered that pardons had
been granted to divers military delinquents in that country,
who had been condemned by legal trial. They seemed
to think those were encouragements to oppression: they
were fired by a national jealousy: they were stimulated
<PB N="515" REF="521"/>
by the relations and friends of those who had been mur∣thered;
and they resolved to wreak their vengeance on the
author of that tragedy, by depriving him of life on the
very day which the judges had fixed for his execution.
Thus determined, they assembled in different bodies, about
ten o'clock at night. They blocked up the gates of
the city, to prevent the admission of the troops that were
quartered in the suburbs. They surprised and disarmed the
town guard: they broke open the prison doors, dragged
Porteous from thence to the place of execution, and leav∣ing
him hanging by the neck on a dyer's pole, quietly
dispersed to their several habitations. This exploit was
performed with such conduct and deliberation as seemed
to be the result of a plan formed by some persons of conse∣quence:
it, therefore, became the object of a very severe
enquiry.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. During this summer a rupture happened
between the Turks and Russians, which last reduced
the city of Asoph on the Black-Sea, and over-ran the
greatest part of Crim Tartary. The Czarina declared
war against the Ottoman Porte, because the Tartars of the
Crimea had made incursions upon her frontiers; and when
she complained of these disorders to the Vizir, she received
no satisfaction: besides, a large body of Tartars had, by
order of that minister, marched through the Russian pro∣vinces
in despite of the Empress, and committed terrible
havock in their route. The Emperor was obliged to en∣gage
as a party in this war, by a treaty offensive and de∣fensive,
which he had many years before concluded with
the Czarina. Yet, before he declared himself, he joined
the maritime powers in offering his mediation to the Sul∣tan,
who was very well disposed to peace; but the Czarina
insisted upon her retaining Asoph, which her forces had
reduced; and this preliminary article being rejected, as
dishonourable to the Ottoman Empire, the court of Vienna
began to make preparations for war. By this time all the
belligerent powers in Italy had agreed to the preliminaries
of peace concluded between the Emperor and France.
<PB N="516" REF="522"/>
The Duke of Lorraine had espoused the Emperor's eldest
daughter, the Archduchess Maria Theresa, and ceded Lor∣raine
to France, even before he succeeded to Tuscany.
Don Carlos was crowned King of Sicily: Stani<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laus abdi∣cated
the crown of Poland; and Augustus was universally
acknowledged sovereign of that kingdom. The prelimi∣naries
were approved and accepted by the diet of the em∣pire:
the King of Spain sent orders for his troops to eva∣cuate
Tuscany; and the provinces in Italy yielded to the
house of Austria. Prince Eugene, who had managed the
interests of the Emperor on this occasion, did not live to see
the happy fruits of his negociation. He died at Vienna,
in April, at the age of seventy-three, leaving behind him
the character of an invincible hero and consummate poli∣tician.
He was not long survived by Count Staremberg,
another Imperial General, who ranked next to the prince
in military reputation. About the same time Great-Britain
sustained a national loss in the death of Lord Chancellor
Talbot, who, by his worth, probity, and acquired accom∣plishments,
had dignified the great office to which he had
been raised. He died universally lamented, in the month
of February, at the age of fifty-two; and was succeeded
on the bench by Lord Hardwicke.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. The King being indisposed in consequence
of having been fatigued by a very tempestuous passage from
Holland, the parliament was prorogued from the twenty-first
day of January to the first of February, and then the
session was opened by commission. The Lord Chancellor,
as one of the peers authorised by this commission, made a
speech in his Majesty's name to both Houses. With respect
to foreign affairs, he told them, that the respective acts of
cession being exchanged, and orders given for the evacu∣ation
and possession of the several countries and places by
the powers concerned, according to the allotment and
disposition of the preliminary articles, the great work of
re-establishing the general tranquillity was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar advanced:
that, however, common prudence called upon them to be
very attentive to the final conclusion of the new settle∣ment.
<PB N="517" REF="523"/>
He said his Majesty could not without surprise and
concern observe the many contrivances and attempts car∣ried
on, in various shapes, and in different parts of the na∣tion,
tumultuously to resist and obstruct the execution of
the laws, and to violate the peace of the kingdom. He
observed, that the consideration of the height to which
these audacious practices might rise, if not timely suppres∣sed,
afforded a melancholy prospect, and required particular
attention, lest they should affect private persons in the quiet
enjoyment of their property, as well as the general peace
and good order of the whole. After the Commons had
agreed to an address, and heard counsel on some contro∣verted
elections, they proceeded to take the supply into
consideration. They voted ten thousand men for the sea-service.
They continued for the land-service the same num∣ber
they had maintained in times of tranquillity, amount∣ing
to seventeen thousand seven hundred and four; but
this measure was not adopted without opposition: the mo∣ney
was raised by the land and malt-taxes, re-enforced with
one million granted out of the sinking fund.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. The chief subject of contention that pre∣sented
itself in the course of this session, was a motion
which Mr. Pulteney made for an address to his Majesty,
that he would be pleased to settle one hundred thousand
pounds a-year upon the Prince of Wales. He repre∣sented
that such provision was conformable to the practice
of ancient times; that what he proposed had been enjoyed
by his present Majesty in the life-time of his father; and
that a settlement of this nature was reasonable and necessary
to ascertain the independency of the apparent heir to the
crown. The motion was vigorously opposed by Sir Ro∣bert
Walpole, as an encroachment on the prerogative; as
an officious intermeddling in the King's family affairs; and
as an effort to set his Majesty and the Prince at variance.
But a misunderstanding, it seems, had already happened in
the royal family. The minister in the midst of his ha∣rangue
told the House, by his Majesty's command, that on
the preceding day the King had sent a message to the
<PB N="518" REF="524"/>
Prince by several noblemen of the first quality, importing,
that his Majesty had given order for settling a jointure up∣on
the Princess of Wales, suitable to her high rank and
dignity, which he would in a proper time lay before
parliament, in order to be rendered more certain and ef∣fectual;
that although his royal highness had not thought
sit, by any application to his Majesty, to desire that his
allowance of fifty thousand pounds might be rendered less
precarious, the King, to prevent the bad consequences
which he apprehended might follow from the undutiful
measures which his Majesty was informed the Prince had
been advised to pursue, would grant to his royal highness,
for his Majesty's life, the said fifty thousand pounds per
annum, to be issued out of the civil-list revenues, over
and above the Prince's revenues arising from the duchy of
Cornwall, which his Majesty thought a very competent
allowance, considering his own numerous issue, and the
great expense which did and must necessarily attend an
honourable provision for the whole royal family; that the
Prince, by a verbal answer, desired their lordships to lay
him with all humility at his Majesty's feet; to assure him
that he did, and ever should retain the utmost duty for his
royal person; that he was very thankful for any instance
of his Majesty's goodness to him or to the Princess, and
particularly for his Majesty's gracious intention of settling a
jointure upon her royal highness; but, that as to the message,
the affair was now out of his hands, and, therefore, he
could give no answer to it; that his royal highness after∣wards
used many dutiful expressions towards his Majesty;
adding, “Indeed, my lords, it is in other hands, and I am
sorry for it;” or words to that effect. Sir Robert
Walpole then endeavoured to demonstrate, that the annual
sum of fifty thousand pounds was as much as the King
could afford to allow for the Prince's maintenance; and he
expatiated upon the bad consequences that might ensue,
if the son should be rendered altogether independent of the
father.</P>
<P><PB N="519" REF="525"/>
§ XXXV. These suggestions did not pass unanswered.
Sir Robert Walpole had asserted, that the parliament had
no right to interfere in the creation or maintenance of a
Prince of Wales; and that in the case of Richard II.
who, upon the death of his father the Black Prince, was
created Prince of Wales, in consequence of an address
or petition from parliament, that measure was in all pro∣bability
directed by the King himself. In answer to this
assertion it was observed, that probably the King would
not have been so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orward in creating his grandson Prince
of Wales, if he had not been forced into this step by his
parliament; for Edward in his old age fell into a sort of
love-dotage, and gave himself entirely up to the manage∣ment
of his mistress, Alice Pierce, and his second son, the
Duke of Lancaster; a circumstance that raised a most rea∣sonable
jealousy in the Black Prince, at that time on his
death bed, who could not but be anxious about the safety
and right of his only son, whom he found he was soon to
leave a child in the hands of a doating grandfather, and
an ambitious, aspiring uncle. The supporters of the moti∣on
observed, that the allowance of fifty thousand pounds
was not sufficient to defray the Prince's yearly expense,
without allotting one shilling for acts of charity and muni∣ficence;
and that the several deductions for land-taxes and
fees reduced it to forty-three thousand pounds. They
affirmed, that his whole income, including the revenues of
the duchy of Cornwall, did not exceed fifty-two thousand
pounds a-year, though, by his Majesty's own regulation,
the expense of the Prince's household amounted to sixty-three
thousand. They proved, that the produce of the
civil-list exceeded nine hundred thousand pounds, a sum
above one hundred thousand pounds a-year more than was
enjoyed by his late Majesty; and that in the first year of
the late King the whole expense of his household and
civil government did not much exceed four hundred and
fifty thousand pounds a-year. They observed, that the
parliament added one hundred and forty thousand pounds
annually for acts of charity and bounty, together with
<PB N="520" REF="526"/>
the article of secret service money; and allowed one hun∣dred
thousand pounds for the maintenance of the Prince
of Wales: that the article of secret service money had
prodigiously increased in the late reign: by an account
which happened to be laid before the parliament, it appear∣ed
that vast sums of money had been given for purposes
which nobody understood, and to persons whom nobody
knew. In the beginning of the following session several
members proposed that this extraordinary account should
be taken into consideration; but the enquiry was warded
off by the other party, who declared that the parliament
could not examine any account which had been presented
to a former session. The debate was fierce and long;
and ended in a division, by which the motion was rejected.
A motion of the same nature was made by Lord Carteret
in the House of Peers, and gave rise to a very keen dispute,
maintained by the same arguments, and issuing in the same
termination.</P>
<P>§ XXXVI. The next remarkable contest was occasion∣ed
by a motion of Sir R. Walpole, who proposed that the
sum of one million should be granted to his Majesty, to∣wards
redeeming the like sum of the increased capital of
the South-Sea company, commonly called South-Sea
annuities. Several members argued for the expediency of
applying this sum to the payment of the debt due to the
Bank, as part of that incumbrance was saddled with
an interest of six per cent. whereas the interest paid for
the other sums that constituted the publick debt did not
exceed four per cent. Many plausible arguments were
offered on both sides of the question; and at length the
motion was carried in the affirmative. The House having
resolved itself into a committee to consider of the national
debt, Sir John Barnard made a motion, for enabling his
Majesty to raise money either by the sale of annuities, or
by borrowing at an interest not exceeding three per
cent. to be applied towards redeeming the South-Sea
annuities; and that such of the said annuitants as should
be inclined to subscribe their respective annuities, should
<PB N="521" REF="527"/>
be preferred to all others. He said, that even those publick
securities which bore an interest of three per cent. only
were sold at a premium in Change-Alley: he was, there∣fore,
persuaded, that all those who were willing to give a
premium for a three per cent. security would gladly lend
their money to the government at the same interest, should
books of subscription be opened for that purpose, with an
assurance that no part of the principal should be paid off
for fourteen years. He expatiated upon the national ad∣vantages
that would accrue from a reduction of interest.
From easy and obvious calculations he inferred, that in
a very little time the interest upon all the South-Sea
annuities would be reduced from four to three per cent.
without any danger to publick credit, or breach of pub∣lick
faith: that then the produce of the sinking <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>und would
amount to fourteen hundred thousand pounds per annum,
to be applied only towards redeeming the capital of the
several trading companies: he proved that this measure
would bring every one of them so much within the power
of parliament, that they would be glad to accept of three
per cent. interest on any reasonable terms; in which case
the sinking fund would rise to one million six hundred
thousand pounds per annum. Then the parliament might
venture to annihilate one half of it, by freeing the people
from the taxes upon coals, candles, soap, leather, and
other such impositions as lay heavy upon the poor labour∣ers
and manufacturers: the remaining part of the sinking
fund might be applied towards the discharge of those
annuities and publick debts which bore an interest of
three per cent. only, and afterwards towards diminishing
the capitals of the several trading companies till the term
of fourteen years should be expired; then the sinking fund
would again amount to above a million yearly, which
would be sufficient for paying them off, and freeing the
nation entirely from all its incumbrances. This salutary
scheme was violently opposed by Alderman Heathcote,
and other partisans of the ministry; yet all their objections
were refuted; and, in order to defeat the project, they
were obliged to have recourse to artifice. Mr. Winning∣ton,
<PB N="522" REF="528"/>
moved, that all the publick creditors, as well as the
South Sea annuitants, should be comprehended. Sir John
Barnard demonstrated, that it might be easy for the govern∣ment
to borrow money at three per cent. sufficient for pay∣ing
off such of the proprietors of four-and-twenty millions
as were not willing to accept of that interest, but it would be
extremely difficult to borrow enough to satisfy the proprietors
of four-and-forty millions, who might choose to have their
principal rather than such an interest. Nevertheless, reso∣lutions
were founded on this and other alterations of the
original scheme; and a bill was immediately prepared. It
produced many other debates, and was at last postponed by
dint of ministerial influence. The same venerable patriot
who projected this scheme moved, that as soon as the inte∣rest
of all the national redeemable debt should be reduced to
three per cent. the House would take off some of the heavy
taxes which oppressed the poor and the manufacturers;
but this motion was rejected by the majority.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1737.</NOTE> The last disputes of this session were ex∣cited
by a bill sent down from the Lords for punishing the
magistrates and city of Edinburgh, on account of the
murder of John Porteous. In the beginning of the session
Lord Carteret recapitulated the several tumults and riots
which had lately happened in different parts of the king∣dom.
He particularly insisted upon the atrocious murder
of Captain Porteous, as a flagrant insult upon the govern∣ment,
and a violation of the publick peace, so much the
more dangerous, as it seemed to have been concerted and
executed with deliberation and decency. He suspected
that some citizens of Edinburgh had been concerned in
the murder, not only from this circumstance, but like∣wise
because, notwithstanding the reward of two hundred
pounds, which had been offered by proclamation for the
discovery of any person who acted in that tragedy, not one
individual had as yet been detected. He seemed to think
that the magistrates had encouraged the riot, and that
the city had forfeited its charter; and he proposed a mi∣nute
enquiry into the particulars of the affair. He was
seconded by the Duke of Newcastle and the Earl of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay;
<PB N="523" REF="529"/>
though this last nobleman differed in opinion from him
with respect to the charter of the city,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. V. 1737.</NOTE> which, he said,
could not be justly forfeited by the fault of the magistracy.
The Lords resolved, That the magistrates and other per∣sons
from whom they might obtain the necessary in∣formation
concerning this riot should be ordered to attend;
and, That an address should be presented to his Majesty,
desiring that the different accounts and papers relating
to the murther of Captain Porteous might be submitted
to the perusal of the House. These documents being
accordingly examined, and all the witnesses arrived, in∣cluding
three Scottish judges, a debate arose about the
manner in which these last should be interrogated, whether
at the bar, at the table, or on the woolsacks. Some
Scottish lords asserted, that they had a right to be seated
next to the judges of England: but after a long debate
this claim was rejected, and the judges of Scotland appeared
at the bar in their robes. A bill was brought in to disable
Alexander Wilson, Esquire, lord-provost of Edinburgh,
from enjoying any office or place of magistracy in the city
of Edinburgh, or elsewhere in Great-Britain; for im∣prisoning
the said Alexander Wilson; for abolishing the
guard of that city; and for taking away the gates of the
Nether-Bow-Port, so as to open a communication between
the city and the suburbs, in which the King's troops are
quartered. The Duke of Argyle, in arguing against this
bill, said he could not think of a proceeding more harsh or
unprecedented than the present, as he believed there was
no instance of the whole weight of parliamentary indig∣nation,
for such he called a proceeding by a bill <HI>ex post
facto,</HI> falling upon any single person, far less upon any
community, for crimes that were within the reach of the
inferior courts of justice: for this reason he observed,
that if the Lord-Provost and citizens of Edinburgh should
suffer in the terms of the present bill, they would suffer by
a cruel, unjust, and fantastical proceeding; a proceeding of
which the worst use might be made, if ever the nation
should have the misfortune to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all under a partial, self-interested
<PB N="524" REF="530"/>
interested administration.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1737.</NOTE> He told them he sat in the
parliament of Scotland when that part of the treaty of
Union relating to the privileges of the royal burghs was
settled on the same footing as religion, that is, they
were made unalterable by any subsequent parliament of
Great-Britain. Notwithstanding the eloquence and
warmth of his remonstrance, the bill was sent down to
the House of Commons, where it produced a violent con∣test.
The Commons set on foot a severe scrutiny into
the particular circumstances that preceded and attended
the murther of Porteous: from the examination of the
evidences it appeared that no freeman or citizen of Edin∣burgh
was concerned in the riot, which was chiefly com∣posed
of country-people, excited by the relations of some
unhappy persons whom Porteous and his men had slain at
the execution of the smuggler; and these were assisted by
prentice boys, and the lowest class of vagabonds that hap∣pened
to be at Edinburgh: that the Lord-Provost had
taken all the precautions to prevent mischief that his re∣flexion
suggested: that he even exposed his person to the
rage of the multitude, in his endeavours to disperse them;
and, that if he had done amiss, he erred from want of
judgement, rather than from want of inclination to pro∣tect
the unhappy Porteous. It likewise appeared, that Mr.
Lindsay, member for the city of Edinburgh, had gone in
person to General Moyle, commander of the forces in
North-Britain, informed him of the riot, implored his
immediate assistance, and promised to conduct his troops
into the city; and that his suit was rejected, because he
could not produce a written order from the magistracy,
which he neither could have obtained in such confusion,
nor ventured to carry about his person through the midst
of an enraged populace. The Scottish members exerted
themselves with uncommon vivacity in defence of their
capital. They were joined by Sir John Barnard, Lord
Cornbury, Mr. Shippen, and Mr. Oglethorpe. Lord
Polwarth declared, that if any gentleman would show where
one argument in the charge against the Lord-Provost and the
<PB N="525" REF="531"/>
city of Edinburgh had been proved, he would that instant
give his vote for the commitment of the bill. He said,
if gentlemen would lay their hands upon their hearts,
and ask themselves, whether they would have voted in
this manner had the case of Edinburgh been that of the
city of Bristol, York, or Norwich, he was persuaded
they would have required that every tittle of the charge
against them should have been fully and undeniably
proved. Some amendments and mitigations being inserted
in the bill, it passed the House, was sent back to the
Lords, who agreed to the alterations, and then received the
royal assent.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. The next e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ort of the minister was ob∣liquely
levelled at the liberty of the press, which it was
much for his interest to abridge. The errors of his con∣duct,
the mystery of that corruption which he had so
successfully reduced to a system, and all the blemishes of
his administration, had been exposed and ridiculed, not
only in political periodical writings produced by the most
eminent hands, but likewise in a succession of theatrical
pieces, which met with uncommon success among the
people. He either wanted judgement to distinguish men
of genius, or could find none that would engage in his
service: he, therefore, employed a set of wretched authors,
void of understanding and ingenuity. They undertook
the defence of his ministry, and answered the animadver∣sions
of his antagonists. The match was so extremely
unequal, that, instead of justifying his conduct, they ex∣posed
it to additional ridicule and contempt; and he saw
himself in danger of being despised by the whole nation.
He resolved to seise the first opportunity to choak those
canals through which the torrent of censure had slowed
upon his character. The manager of a playhouse com∣municated
to him a manuscript farce, intituled, The
Golden Rump, which was fraught with treason and abuse
upon the government, and had been presented to the stage
for exhibition. This performance was produced in the
House of Commons. The minister descanted upon the
<PB N="524" REF="532"/><GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="525" REF="533"/><GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="526" REF="534"/>
insolence, the malice, the immorality, and the seditious
calumny, which had been of late propagated in theatri∣cal
pieces. A bill was brought in to limit the number
of playhouses; to subject all dramatick writers to the in∣spection
of the Lord-Chamberlain; and to compel them to
take out a license for every production before it could
appear on the stage. Notwithstanding a vigorous oppo∣sition,
this bill passed through both Houses with extra∣ordinary
dispatch, and obtained the royal sanction. In
this debate the Earl of Chesterfield distinguished himself
by an excellent speech, that will ever endear his character
to all the friends of genius and literature, to all those who
are warmed with zeal for the liberties of their country.
“Our stage (said he) ought certainly to be kept within
due bounds; but, for this purpose, our laws as they
stand at present are sufficient. If our stage-players at
any time exceed those bounds, they ought to be prose∣cuted;
they may be punished. We have precedents,
we have examples of persons punished for things less
criminal than some pieces which have been lately re∣presented:
a new law must, therefore, be unnecessary;
and in the present case it cannot be unnecessary with∣out
being dangerous. Every unnecessary restraint is a
fetter upon the legs, is a shackle upon the hands of
liberty. One of the greatest blessings we enjoy, one of
the greatest blessings a people can enjoy, is liberty.
But every good in this life has its allay of evil. Li∣centiousness
is the allay of liberty. It is an ebullition,
an excrescence; it is a speak upon the eye of the politi∣cal
body, which I can never touch but with a gentle,
with a trembling hand, lest I destroy the body; lest I
injure the eye upon which it is apt to appear. If the
stage becomes at any time licentious, if a play appears to
be a libel upon the government, or upon any particular
man, the King's courts are open; the law is sufficient
to punish the offender. If poets and players are to be
restrained, let them be restrained as other subjects are,
by the known laws of their country; if they offend,
<PB N="527" REF="535"/>
let them be tried as every Englishman ought to be, by
God and their country. Do not let us subject them
to the arbitrary will and pleasure of any one man. A
power lodged in the hands of a single man to judge
and determine without limitation, control, or appeal, is
a sort of power unknown to our laws, inconsistent
with our constitution. It is a higher, a more absolute
power than we trust even to the King himself; and,
therefore, I must think we ought not to vest any
such power in his Majesty's lord-chamberlain.” His
arguments had no effect, though the House admired his
elocution; and the playhouse bill passed into a law. On
the twenty-first day of June the King made a short speech
to both Houses, and the Lord Chancellor prorogued the
parliament.</P>
