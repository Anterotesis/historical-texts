<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IN the year 1711, Mr. <HI>Charles Johnson</HI> alter'd the
<HI>Gamester,</HI> written originally by <HI>Shirley,</HI> into a Co∣medy,
which he call'd the <HI>Wife</HI>'s <HI>Relief,</HI> or <HI>the Husband</HI>'s
<HI>Cure:</HI> In this play he retain'd <HI>Shirley</HI>'s under-plot of
<HI>Leonora, Violante</HI> and <HI>Beaumont;</HI> which has no necessary
dependance upon the principal action, and had therefore
been generally censur'd as impertinent; nor has it, sepa∣rately
consider'd, any excellence to attone for that defect.
The editor of the <HI>Gamesters,</HI> as it is now a second time
alter'd from <HI>Shirley,</HI> will not presume to offer any ob∣jections
to the alterations and additions which Mr. <HI>John∣son</HI>
has been pleas'd to make—It will be sufficient for
him to inform the reader, that he has nothing in common
with <HI>Johnson,</HI> but what both he and <HI>Johnson</HI> have in
common with <HI>Shirley.</HI> The characters of <HI>Barnacle</HI> and
the <HI>Nephew,</HI> which were before unconnected with the
principal action, are now interwoven with it: what alte∣rations
and additions have been now made, will be better
known by a comparison of this play with the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is printed in the 8th volume of the collection of old plays, pub∣lished
by Mr. <HI>Dodsley.</HI></NOTE> original,
and are, with great deference, submitted to the candor of

<L><HI>WHENE'ER the wits of</HI> France <HI>take pen in hand,</HI></L>
<L>To give a sketch of you, and this our land;</L>
<L>One settled maxim through the whole you see—</L>
<L>To wit—their great superiority!</L>
<L>Urge what you will, they still have this to say;</L>
<L>That you who ape them, are less wise than they.</L>
<L>'Tis thus these well bred letter-writers use us;</L>
<L>They trip o'er here, with half an eye peruse us;</L>
<L>Embrace us, eat our meat, and then—abuse us.</L>
<L>When this same play was writ, that's now before ye,</L>
<L><HI>The</HI> English <HI>stage had reach'd its point of glory!</HI></L>
<L>No paulty thefts disgrac'd this author's pen,</L>
<L><HI>He painted</HI> English <HI>manners,</HI> English <HI>men;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And form'd his taste on</HI> Shakespear <HI>and</HI> old Ben.</L>
<L><HI>Then were</HI> French <HI>farces, fashions, quite unknown;</HI></L>
<L>Our wits wrote well, and all they writ their own:</L>
<L>These were the times when no infatuation,</L>
<L>No vicious modes, no zeal for imitation,</L>
<L><HI>Had chang'd, deform'd, and sunk the</HI> British <HI>nation.</HI></L>
<L>Should you be ever from yourselves estrang'd,</L>
<L><HI>The</HI> cock <HI>will crow, to see the</HI> lion <HI>chang'd!</HI></L>
<L>To boast our liberty is weak, and vain,</L>
<L>While tyrant vices in our bosoms reign;</L>
<L><HI>Not liberty</HI> alone, <HI>a nation saves;</HI></L>
<L>Corrupted freemen are the worst of slaves.</L>
<L><HI>Let</HI> Pru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ia'<HI>s sons each</HI> English <HI>breast inflame;</HI></L>
<L>O be our spirit, as our cause, the same!</L>
<L>And as our hearts with one religion glow,</L>
<L>Let us with all their ardors drive the foe,</L>
<L>As heav'n had rais'd our arm, as heav'n had giv'n the blow!</L>
<L>Would you re-kindle all your ancient fires?</L>
<L>Extinguish first your modern, vain desires:</L>
<L>Still it is yours, your glories to retrieve;</L>
<L>Lop but the branches, and the tree shall live:</L>
<L>With these erect a pile for sacrifice!</L>
<L>And in the midst—throw all your cards and dice!</L>
<L>Then fire the heap; and as it sinks to earth,</L>
<L><HI>The</HI> British <HI>genius shall have second birth!</HI></L>
<L><HI>Shall,</HI> Phoenix-<HI>like, rise perfect from the flame,</HI></L>

SPOKEN by Mrs. CIBBER.</BYLINE>
<L>MY conduct now will every mind employ,</L>
<L>And all my friends, I'm sure, will wish me joy:</L>
<L>'Tis joy indeed, and fairly worth the cost,</L>
<L>To've gain'd the wand'ring heart I once had lost.</L>
<L>Hold, says the prudish dame with scornful sneer,</L>
<L>I must, sweet madam, stop your high career;</L>
<L>Where was your pride, your decency, your sense,</L>
<L>To keep your husband in that strange suspense?</L>
<L>For my part, I abominate these scenes—</L>
<L><HI>No</HI> ends <HI>compensate for such odious means:</HI></L>
<L>To me, I'm sure—but 'tis not fit to utter—</L>
<L>The very thought has put me in a flutter!</L>
<L>Odious, says miss, of quick and forward parts;</L>
<L>Had she done more, she'd given him his deserts:</L>
<L>O, had the wretch but been a spark of mine,</L>
<L><HI>By</HI> Jove, <HI>I shou'd have paid him in his coin.</HI></L>
<L>Another critic ventures to declare,</L>
<L><HI>She thinks that cousin</HI> Pen <HI>has gone too far:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Nay, surely,</HI> she <HI>has play'd a generous part;</HI></L>
<L>A fair dissembler, with an honest heart.</L>
<L>Wou'd any courtly dame in such a case,</L>
<L>Sollicit, get, <HI>and then</HI> RESIGN <HI>the place?</HI></L>
<L>She knew, good girl, my husband<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s reformation,</L>
<L><HI>Was (what you'll scarce believe) my</HI> only <HI>passion:</HI></L>
<L>And when your scheme is good, and smart, and clever,</L>
<L>Cousins <HI>have been convenient persons ever.</HI></L>
<L>With all your wisdom, madam, cries a wit,</L>
<L><HI>Had</HI> Pen <HI>been false, you had been fairly bit:</HI></L>

The truly good ne'er treat with indignation,</L>

<L>Ye beauteous, happy fair, who know to bless,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Haz.</SPEAKER>
<L>Come, I love thee well;</L>
<L>But not thy wit, to carry things no handsomer:</L>
<L>You must unravel again, and make your wife</L>
<L>Believe you did but try her.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee drop the subject; don't set my
teeth on edge with talking so much about, my wife.—Can'st
not see by my wry faces, that 'tis holding
the vial to my nose, after I have taken the physic.—Prithee
no more of her—now tell me, what
brought thee this way!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Haz.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was going to meet old <HI>Barnacle.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild. Barnacle!</SPEAKER>
<P>what can such opposites possibly
do together? He wants you to beat some body for
him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Haz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, <HI>Jack,</HI> I have no superfluous valour
to dispose of—I have but just enough to defend my∣self
from the impertinence of some, and the villainy
of others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>A gamester by profession, <HI>Will,</HI> shou'd be
always ready to draw his sword, as the circumstances
of play, and the support of his honour may re∣quire it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Haz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, there are gamesters who are ever draw∣ing
their swords to support their honour, and of
consequence are for ever fighting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>And they find their account in't—For gen∣tlemen
in general had much rather submit to have
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
their pockets pickt, than run the risque of having
their throats cut: but prithee, <HI>Hazard,</HI> how do you
escape these firedrakes; for you are pretty open and
direct in your censures upon 'em?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Haz.</SPEAKER>
<P>What will they get by quarrelling with me?
they know I dare fight, and that I hate a scoundrel;
and whenever madam <HI>Fortune</HI> is pleas'd to jilt, and
strip me, I always fall upon her bullies; and as they
don't love fighting, for fighting sake, they call me
an odd fellow, and let me alone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! but to return to <HI>Barnacle</HI>—
What is become of that genius his nephew?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Haz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just now return'd from college, as great
a genius as he went—He has been exposing
himself these two years at the university, in the cha∣racters
of the rake and the scholar, and now is come
up to make the same figure in town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not he an insufferable blockhead?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Haz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, an insufferable blockhead; but not ab∣solutely
ignorant—his tutor has got words into him
without ideas; so his folly and scholarship set one
another off to a most ridiculous advantage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>What <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> he has, I suppose
lies in his head, as his uncle's money does in the
chest, without being of the least use to himself, or
any body else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Haz.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are mistaken, sir; his uncle will spare
no expence to make his hopeful kinsman a fine gen∣tleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild▪</SPEAKER>
<P>Then the matter is out—he comes to bind
him apprentice to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Haz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your humble servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>His debauchery will become him as little as
his learning; so that in time we shall see the hopeful
youth not only contemptible but infamous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Haz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not that the old gentleman yonder, com∣ing
this way?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is indeed; and therefore I shall leave you
to your entertainment—squeeze a few hundreds out
<PB N="9" REF="14"/>
of him if you can—I must back to my kinswoman—
I can't rest without her—Shall I see you at the old
place this afternoon?</P>
</SP>

<P>You shall—I wish I cou'd get this <HI>Penelope</HI>
out of his hands. She's a charming girl, and tho'
she has not quite money enough to be made a wife
of, by one of no fortune, yet she has too many
good qualities to be made a strumpet of, by such a
fellow as <HI>Wilding</HI>—he will not succeed surely—

<L>The list of those are called the blades, that roar</L>

<L>I apprehend;</L>

<L>Our breeding from a trade, cits as you call us,</L>
<L>Tho' we hate gentlemen ourselves, yet are</L>
<L>Ambitious to make all our children gentlemen:</L>
<L>In three generations they return again;</L>
<L>We for our children purchase land; they brave it</L>
<L>I'th' country, beget children, and they sell;</L>
<L>Grow poor, and send their sons up to be 'prentices:</L>
<L>There is a whirl in fate. The courtiers make</L>
<L>Us cuckolds; mark, we wriggle into their</L>

not have love enough to be jealous of me, I know he has
too much pride to be easy, if he thought I was false to
