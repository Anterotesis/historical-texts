<P>THE liberal manner in which a variety of materials for this work have been contributed, demands the author's earliest and most grateful acknowledge∣ments. He begs leave, with great respect, to confess the honour he received by the bishop of Durham's permission to transcribe, in the office of his auditor, those valuable records hitherto with-held from the public, the DOOMSDAY BOOK of the county, called <HI>Boldon Buke</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This book is kept in the Auditor's Office at Durham: It is a small folio, consisting of 24 pages, wrote in a bad hand, about the year 1183, by order of bishop Pudsey; relates only to the bishop's demesnes, or the villainage tenures; and takes no notice of the barons, or tenants <HI>in capite.</HI> This book has been always reckoned of great value and curiosity, and admitted several times as evidence in the courts of law at Dur∣ham. There is a neat transcript of it in the Chapter library at Durham, made by Christ. Hunter, M. D. and another is extant in the Bodleian library at Oxford (LAUD l. 52), being a thin quarto, consisting of 23 closely written paper leaves, and has once belonged to bishop Tunstall, whose name, CUTHBERTUS DU∣NELM. E. written as it seems by his own hand, is at the bottom of the first page: It is wrote in a small neat hand, about the age of Henry IV. The cover has been blue velvet, and in the inside has the following title, "Boldon Book—<HI>Inquisitio de Consuetudinibus et Redditibus totius Episcopatus Dunelmensis, facta per Hugonem Episcopum anno</HI> 1183."</NOTE>, and bishop Hatfield's Survey, so material to this work in the elucidation of ancient tenures and services.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE human genius knows not a nobler effort than that of collecting the various events of distant times, and placing them in such successive order and arrangement, as to exhibit a perfect delineation of the rise and progress of states, the civilization of mankind, and advances of science. By the labours of the historian are transmitted the great vicissitudes which have attended on human affairs, and the knowledge of those principles which influenced the prosperity, as well as decline of empires; from which affecting examples, wisdom forms her noblest precepts. In such a review we become interested in the fate of the several personages, who first attempted to release mankind from darkness and barbarism, and our hearts participate the joy of those, whose wisdom tamed the ferocity of savage habits, and cultivated the human mind in the school of science and the liberal arts.</P>
<P>Whilst through oral tradition alone interesting events were communicated, history was dark and uncertain; affected by the fortunes of men, and suffering mutilation by the fall of states, much obscurity frequently enveloped the most important changes; for before the invention of letters, public monuments were the chief means of saving the greatest atchievements of nations, and the most wonderful acts of providential interposition from oblivion.</P>
<PB N="ii" REF="8"/>
<P>To such we are obliged to resort, when we discuss those distant aeras, in which letters did not prevail, or in countries where they had not acceptation.</P>
<P>The work of the historian, in the first ages of literature, was laborious and unpleasant; much depending on the uncertain definition of emblematical images, and mysterious traditions; whilst a retrospection through uncultivated ages, with the progress of ignorant and uncivilized nations, furnished disagree∣able scenes. It is some happiness to us, that compassionate angels have with∣held the humiliating picture from our eyes.</P>
<P>A multitude of records lies before me for the present work: It is a field in which I am the first adventurer:—The toil of arranging such a chaos of ma∣terials, will, I flatter myself, prevail with every liberal mind to overlook errors and inadvertencies, into which I may have fallen. So far as progress is made, I have at least opened the passage to some abler pen, that may perfect the work.</P>
<P>The rise and advancement of this opulent Bishoprick, and the original state of the Palatinate, require my attention, before I proceed to a description of the country, or the history of its particular members. To that end it is necessary to look back into antiquity, and to gather up from their obscurity the con∣stituent parts, which have formed this powerful Principality.</P>
<P>The Roman writers inform us, that this was part of the province of the <HI>Bri∣gantes.</HI> Little information is gained from them, as to the manners of the na∣tives, their interior police, or public character. What they furnish, is chiefly a superficial relation, that they were a brave, hardy and adventurous people, were led to battle by an elected chieftain, and struggled long against the progress of conquest; insomuch that it was not 'till near the 80th year of the Christian aera, that they submitted to the Roman arms: They were esteemed the bravest race of Britons, and consisted of those heroes who would not submit to the invaders as they advanced in conquest, but with a true patriotic virtue strove to retain their native liberty.</P>
<P>We have no authorities from whence to form a conclusion, by what people or from what region, this part of Britain first received its inhabitants: Its vicinity to the German shores, and some striking similarities in ancient customs, habits and religion, render it probable that many settlers came originally from thence, of the Celtae or Gauls. The Romans indeed tell us, that the few who understood the tillage of lands, dwelt near the shores, and brought the practice from Germany. It would be an impertinent and useless labour to encumber the work with enquiries on this head, or attempt to gather up into one point of view, the various sentiments of the learned on the subject: It must suffice, that the inhabitants of this district, on the accession of the Romans, were the Brigantes. The Ottadini held the territories north of Tyne, bordering on the German ocean; and the Gadeni the mountainous district to the west.</P>
<P>The civil jurisdiction of the Druids, and their principles of religion, univer∣sally prevailed over this island. They held the supreme judicature, not under any established code of laws, but on equitable principles; matters of right, and complaints of injuries being determined by such sense as the assembled dele∣gates
<PB N="iii" REF="9"/>entertained of impartial justice; and on discordance of opinion in the congress, appeal was made to the Arch-Druid, whose sentence was final. The ceremonies of their religion were few, and much after the manner of the ancient Hebrews; they worshipped on high places, and in solemn groves; they were not addicted to idolatry, but adored the God of nature, and rendered him praises on the annual succession of seasons, which they kept as solemn festivals: They seem to have practised little priestcraft, and held not the igno∣rance of their adherents in the bonds of superstition. Their moral rules were deduced from experience in social life, and their acts of piety attributed to obvious causes in the events of providence; which was of all others the most easy means of calling up the conviction and devotion of ignorant minds. In their civil government we hear of no punishments but two; for crimes of a lower cast, the offender was prohibited joining in public worship, and ex∣communicated from benefits civil and religious: In this state, he was as <HI>Cain,</HI> an outcast before heaven and before men, being deprived of society, and all its comforts: For crimes of the most atrocious kind, the offender was sacrificed to the attribute of <HI>Justice,</HI> with all the solemnity human art could devise, to render the example tremendous to the spectator.</P>
<P>Their monuments which remain to us from the destroying hand of the Romans, who were assiduous to efface every memorial of them, are of two kinds; one peculiarly adapted to religious offices and contemplations, sur∣rounded with groves; the other consisting of a vast circle of large stones, with a column of superior height separated from the ring, together with an altar. Those are with the greatest probability conjectured to have been their courts of judicature; each large stone in the circle, like the memorials of the Hebrews, at the pass of Jordan, appertaining to a distinct division of the people, who were amenable to that assembly, and where the delegate took his station at the time of convocation. Their assemblies were opened with solemn rites of religion, and therefore the altar was prepared; where if no sacrifice was made, perhaps the sacred fire, as an emblem of the divine presence, blazed with odoriferous woods. The column was the awful type of justice, and the place where the criminal suffered death.</P>
<P>The mysteries of their religion were not committed to writing, to prevent schisms and divisions; their maxims of justice were taught orally, to take away from the people all possibility of chicanery and innovation. The sons of chief personages were disciples in their ethic school, where the rules of moral life were inculcated as the grounds of human wisdom. They studied medicine, and in the virtues of plants, of which Misletoe was their chief specific, their whole knowledge of pharmacy consisted. By reason of several ancient gems, which have been discovered, and attributed to the Druids, they have been charged with superstition, as using divinations and charms; but these, when impartially examined, were no other than amulets or religious trinkets, representing the grand attributes of the Divinity, his wisdom, eternity, and universal love.—In the eastern nations the serpent
<PB N="iv" REF="10"/>was used emblematically, and the Druids borrowed it, most probably, from emigrants, who spread into Germany, and perhaps crossed the Channel: And there is little doubt, from their great affection to the emblems of eternity, that their faith extended to a future state, and perhaps they had some idea of the immortality of the soul.</P>
<P>Under such authority, the Britons had no want of regal power; except in times of war, and public calamity, when a chieftain was elected: The sove∣reigns transmitted to us by historians, only figured during such conflicts and critical conjunctures.</P>
<P>When they became intimately connected with the Roman invaders, inter∣married with them, and were both as one people, they deviated from the purity of their religion by adopting the polytheism of the Romans. The Brigantes had their peculiar gods, or perhaps conceived images expressive of the attributes of the Deity they had anciently worshipped; of which we find two memorials, Brigantia and Belatucader; and of these I shall give the opinion of learned antiquaries in my notes.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From Gale's Manuscripts: A Letter from Sir John Clerk to Roger Gale, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> concerning a Roman statue of Dea Brigantia, found at Middleby, in Annandale, in July, 1731.
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I had written to you sooner, but that you told me you was to go into Yorkshire for six weeks. I hope this will find you safely returned, and the inclosed will divert you a little. Those stones are in my posses∣sion, so you may believe the draught I have sent you is exact. They were found in July last, in a camp which Mr Gordon mentions in his Itin. p. 18. I have sent my Lord Pembroke a draught of them, but if he hears perhaps that any body but himself has them, he will not be pleased: In the mean while you may make what use you please of the inclosed description, that is, if you think proper you may give it either to the Secretary of the Royal or Antiquarian Society; but first I beg it of you to correct every thing you think amiss in it.</P>
<P>The stone No. 1. has on it the representation of a human figure, in bass relief, which is dressed in a long robe, with a crown or diadem on its head, a globe in the left hand, and a spear in the right, a head or medal hangs at the breast, and below at the left foot is a shield, at the right foot a round cap, and under the feet is this inscription:
<LIST>
<ITEM>BRIGANTIAE. S. AMANDVS</ITEM>
<ITEM>ARCITECTVS. EX. IMPERIO. IMP. I.</ITEM>
</LIST>
The reading of which I take to be, <HI>Brigantiae sacrum,</HI> or perhaps <HI>sacellum, Amandus Arcitectus ex imperio Imperatoris. Amandus</HI> is a name common in inscriptions, <HI>[see Gruter]</HI> and there is mention of one of this name in <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI> much about the time of <HI>Julian:</HI> In the word <HI>Arcitectus</HI> the A is defaced, and an H is wanting, but it seems to denote the trade of <HI>Amandus,</HI> to wit, an architect, such being common in those days, see <HI>Not. Imp.</HI> toward the end, <HI>de corporibus Artificum:</HI> The last word <HI>Imp.</HI> may be <HI>Imperatoris,</HI> or probably <HI>impensis,</HI> but the first is most probable.</P>
<P>The crown or diadem may be attributed to <HI>Julian,</HI> for with such the Roman emperors of the lower em∣pire used to be ornamented, wherefore <HI>Basilius Seleuciae Episcopus in Sermone I<SUP>o</SUP> de Adam</HI> describes their dia∣dem in this manner, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and many of the emperors are represented in their coins <HI>Capitibus radiatis.</HI> The globe and spear may likewise be attributed to him; for there is a coin of one of his predecessors, <HI>Caracalla,</HI> in which, according to <HI>Vaillant,</HI> p. 264, there is <HI>Figura virilis nuda stans dextra globum laeva hastam gerens;</HI> and he adds, <HI>Nulla est certior principis effigies quam periti gubernatoris, ut refert Plato in Politico, ideo Did. Julianus in nummis globum gerit &amp; rector orbis perhibetur.</HI> From this account of <HI>Vaillant</HI> as to <HI>Didius Julianus,</HI> one might conjecture that this is a figure of <HI>Flavius Julianus,</HI> and the rather because his name seems to be mentioned on the altar, No. 2. (another piece of antiquity found at the same time) and the aforesaid <HI>Basilius</HI> in the same place takes notice of this ornament in the hands of emperors.</P>
<P>Another conjecture may be, that this is a figure of <HI>Mercury,</HI> a favourite god of <HI>Flavius Julianus,</HI> to whom he used sometimes to sacrifice privately, though at that time by profession a Christian. This appears from <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus,</HI> lib. 16, ca. 5. <HI>Occulte Mercurio supplicahat, quem mundi velociorem sensum esse motum mentium suscitantem theologicae prodidere doctrinae;</HI> and because he is mentioned on both the stones No. 2 and 3. But here there is no <HI>petasus,</HI> no wings, no <HI>caduceus,</HI> no crook, no purse, nor other genuine marks, by which <HI>Mercury</HI> is commonly represented.</P>
<P>A third conjecture may be, that this is a figure of <HI>the country of the Brigantes</HI> in Britain, under the name of <HI>Brigantia,</HI> which <HI>Tacitus</HI> thus describes in <HI>Vit. Agric.</HI> ca. 17. <HI>Brigantum civitatem quae numerosissima pro∣vinciae totius perhibetur.</HI> This is the more probable, because the diadem seems rather to be a <HI>corona muralis,</HI> as some of the Roman provinces are represented in the <HI>Notitia Imperii,</HI> and because the breasts are larger than they are commonly made in a male figure. Or it may be a representation of <HI>Rome,</HI> because of the globe, a mark of power and authority, which could not be so properly ascribed to the <HI>civitas Brigantum.</HI></P>
<P>A very learned gentleman, <HI>Mr Horsley,</HI> takes this figure to be a <HI>Pallas,</HI> and that the ornament hanging at her neck is the <HI>Gorgon,</HI> taken notice of by <HI>Virgil</HI> in his description of this goddess, lib. 8, v. 437.</P>
<Q><L>—"ip samque in pectore divae</L>
<L>"Gorgona defecto vertentem lumina collo."</L></Q>
<P>This I confess is so probable a conjecture, that there is no way to evade it, except by supposing it may be one of those ornaments which was found about eight years ago in this very place, viz. a gold medal of <HI>Con∣stantine,</HI> coined on one side, the other being plain, with a hole on the edge; by which it appeared to be a certain badge or ornament, which was usually worn in those days by way of a <HI>bulla;</HI> for the <HI>imagines princi∣pum,</HI> which were annexed to public papers, were of another kind. This medal is mentioned by <HI>Mr Gordon</HI> in his Itin. Sept. p. 18, and is now in the possession of the <HI>Earl of Pembroke.</HI></P>
<P>One might suppose this figure to be one of these <HI>Hermathenae</HI> mentioned in <HI>Cicero's Epist. prim. ad Atticum. Hermathena tua valdè me delectat et posita ita bellè est ut totum gymnasium <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> videatur. Hermathena</HI> is a goddess composed of <HI>Mercury</HI> and <HI>Minerva.</HI></P>

<P>Those stones were found among the ruins of a building which may be supposed to have been a temple. By the foundation it appears to have been 36 feet in length, and 12 feet in breadth; it stands without the walls of the Roman station, which have been <HI>ex lapide quadrato.</HI> Tem∣ples have been found so situated in many other places; as for instance, the <HI>Templum Termini,</HI> on the north side of the <HI>Vallum Antonii Pij.</HI> because it seems that the Romans judged their gods were sufficient to defend their own temples. The station is called at this day the Birns or Bearns, which probably comes from the word <HI>Brigantes.</HI></P>

<P>“I observe that there are such things as local gods and goddesses, which the Romans were much acquainted with in the days of Au∣gustus, wherefore this Brigantia may be a goddess, and the statue a figure designed to represent her.—This statue has been gilded all over, for upon picking out some of the earth about it, I perceived the gold leaf, and since that time I have met with a gentleman, who told me, that when this statue was first found, a great part of it was still gilded, but that the country people brought it almost all off ”by washing it with sand and water.</P>

The high opinion of her extensive abilities was, no doubt, the original of so many attributes conferred on this goddess by her adorers, as well as the gilding of the statue all over, as this was, when first dug up, and before the gold was scoured off by the ignorant people, who first got her into their hands. The inscription tells us, she was the goddess or nymph <HI>Brigantia,</HI> a local or tutelar deity of the <HI>Brigantes,</HI> as the <HI>Dea Roma</HI> was of Rome. We have other inscriptions in honour of her, as that in Selden, in Marm. Arundel, and another in Cambden, edit. Lond. 1695, p. 336, beginning

<ITEM>SALVTE PLAVTILLAE, &amp;c.</ITEM>
</LIST>
These hitherto have been understood, as if they had not expressed the proper name of the goddess, referring only to some unknown deity of the <HI>Brigantes,</HI> but this inscription gives us her name at length, and informs us that the others are to be read <HI>Deae Nymphae Brigantiae,</HI> and not <HI>Deae Nymphae Brigantum,</HI> as was formerly supposed. The words <HI>Brigantiae signum,</HI> or <HI>sacellum posuit Amandus architectus ex im∣perio I.</HI> are so plain, that nothing can be added except as to the letters <HI>imp. I.</HI> of which I shall hereafter take notice.</P>
<P>It is not in the least improbable, that when <HI>Julian</HI> came to be master of himself and the empire, and apostatised from the Christian religion, he would encourage the Pagan worship in this island, as well as other countries, and to that end establish a college of the <HI>Dendrophori</HI> or <HI>Ligniferi,</HI> with other superstitions restored by him, and they to oblige the Emperor to erect a statue of his darling <HI>Mercury?</HI> And why might not the Emperor, to please the province of the <HI>Brigantes,</HI> and ingratiate himself with them, give command to <HI>Amandus,</HI> his architect in these parts, to set up this stately image of their adored <HI>Brigantia,</HI> or to build a temple for her reception? — If so, the last letters under this gilded figure may without force ”be interpreted IMP. I. <HI>ex imperio Imperatoris Juliani.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have the happiness of yours of the 25th of last month, and am glad to be confirmed in some of my con∣jectures, by your opinions which are so well founded. That of the statue being a goddess, under the name of <HI>Brigantia,</HI> is perfectly right. I took notice of this in the first words of my paper, and since that time I ac∣quainted you with my being a little better satisfied in that notion; but since your last to me, and the reasons you give, I have no manner of doubt about this figure, and therefore I chearfully give up all manner of cou∣jectures that differ with this. Besides the inscription you mention, there is another in England to the DEAE NYMPH. BRIG. which is taken notice of in your father's book upon <HI>Antoninus's Journey,</HI> p. 53, published by you; and there are a vast number of inscriptions to the local gods, every where to be met with abroad: As for the lady <HI>Brigantia,</HI> I confess I never met with her name, for hitherto I took the <HI>Nympha Brigantum</HI> to be something like the inscription <HI>St Paul</HI> takes notice of at <HI>Athens,—to the unknown god.</HI> The crown on her head is visibly now a <HI>corona muralis,</HI> with a kind of porch in the wall, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a letter from <HI>Mr Ward,</HI> Professor of Rhetorick at Gresham College, to <HI>Roger Gale,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>Since I was last to wait upon you, I received the inclosed from <HI>Mr Horsley</HI> which I take leave to send you, in order to beg the favour of you to inform me, whether the copy you had from <HI>Baron Clerk</HI> differs in any respect from the reading of this; and as some doubts have occurred to my thoughts in relation both to the inscriptions and figure, you will permit me to take this opportunity of laying them before you:</P>
<P>I have some suspicion about the word BRIGANTIAE, and if there was room for any conjecture, should imagine it might some-how be designed for BRIGANT DEAE or DIVAE. In the London edit. of <HI>Camden.</HI> 1695, p. 896, there is an inscription that begins DEAE NYMPHAE BRIG. which part of it <HI>Mr Selden</HI> has inserted in his edition of <HI>Marm. Arundeliana,</HI> vol. ii. p. 1477, and there is likewise in the same edition of Camden, p. 851, another inscription DVI. CI. BRIG. and is there read <HI>Dui civitatas Brigantum.</HI> But if what appears now like DVI may be supposed to have been at first DIVAE, I should fancy both these inscriptions, as also this new one, may possibly all refer to the same deity, without any particular name given to her. I am the more suspicious that some of the letters in the word <HI>Brigantiae</HI> are obscure, because a friend of mine shewed me the other day a copy of the inscription without the figure, which he borrowed of a gentle∣man who lately brought it out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and told him it agreed with the first draught which the <HI>Baron</HI> took of them; now in that copy the word is written BRIGANT. AE. If therefore what looks like a small I be only the remaining stroke of a D,<NOTE PLACE="inter">It is plainly TIE on the stone, and therefore this is all sup∣position. R. G.</NOTE> it may originally have been for <HI>Deae,</HI> or DAE, for <HI>Divae;</HI> or if the last letter be a single E, as in the new copy DE for Deae, for I find D. S. for <HI>Deus</HI> in <HI>Nisatus.</HI></P>
<P>As to the figure, the wings, as you was pleased to observe to me, plainly shew it to be a <HI>Victory,</HI> and both the helmet and shield at the feet, with the mural crown and laurels on the head, as also the globe in the left hand, seem all to agree in representing the happy effects of a victory. But the spear in the right hand, with the small face at the breast, look to me like the symbols of <HI>Pallas,</HI> as they do to <HI>Mr Horsley,</HI> for there are some <HI>gorgons</HI> upon the breast of her images in <HI>Montfaucon</HI> much like this image; therefore it may be a sort of compound image comprehending the symbols of both the deities, not unlike perhaps to the <HI>Pallas victrix</HI> mentioned in <HI>Gruter,</HI> who has an inscription <HI>Pallad-victrici sacrum,</HI> p. 1077, 6; and this image is pretended to be set up <HI>ex imperio,</HI> by a divine command, a thing not uncommon with the Romans, which might be fancied in a dream, and the form of it was very probably made according to the imaginary ap∣pearance of the <HI>Dea Brigantum</HI> at that time, which might be that of a <HI>Pallas victrix</HI> with these symbols. The most natural sense of the last letters IMP. seems to be <HI>impensa,</HI> but that would be more certain if <HI>s</HI> fol∣lowed for <HI>sua</HI> as usual.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The drawing, or rather sketch, I now lay before you, was made from a Roman altar, lately dug up in the Vicar's garden, a <HI>Burgh on the Sands,</HI> in <HI>Cumberland,</HI> supposed to have been the <HI>Axelodunum</HI> of the <HI>Notitia,</HI> but certainly was a Roman station, close adjoining on <HI>Severus's</HI> wall. It is of a coarse red stone, adorned only with plain mouldings. The inscription is complete, but the letters very rude and meanly cut, though very legible, consisting but of two words, viz. DEO BELATUCA, which certainly stands for <HI>Belatucadro,</HI> and I think the fifth inscription which has been discovered in Great-Britain addressed to this local deity, for such I am inclined to pronounce it with <HI>Camden,</HI> and <HI>Gale,</HI> or at least another name for <HI>Apollo,</HI> with <HI>Dr Ward,</HI> and not a cognomen of <HI>Mars,</HI> or another appellation of him, as has been conjectured.</P>
<P>The first in point of time, that has been discovered, was inscribed on an altar dug up at <HI>Elenborough,</HI> in <HI>Cumberland,</HI> and seen by <HI>Mr Camden</HI> there, though now lost: It runs as in the mar∣gin,<NOTE PLACE="inter">BELATV CADRO IVL. CI. VILIS. OPT. V. S. L. M.</NOTE> and where the word <HI>Belatucadro</HI> stands singly, without the adjunct <HI>Deo.</HI> The second we have in the additions to the <HI>Britannia Rom.</HI> an altar said by <HI>Horsley</HI> to be now lost, though it was remaining at <HI>Netherby,</HI> a famous station in <HI>Cumberland,</HI> where it was dug up not many years since, and is as follows: DEO MARTI. BELATUCADRO. RO. VR. Here, says <HI>Mr Horsley,</HI> it is justly remarked, that this inscription argues <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Belatucader</HI> to be the same deity; but it is more justly supposed by <HI>Dr Ward,</HI> that the conjunctive <HI>et</HI> between <HI>Marti</HI> and <HI>Belatucadro</HI> was omitted by the transcribers, and consequently they were two distinct deities. The third was an altar found also in this county, near <HI>Scaleby Castle,</HI> and thus inscribed: <HI>Mr Horsley</HI> in his remarks upon this in∣scription,<NOTE PLACE="inter">DEO. S. BE LATVCA ROAV. DO∣VLLINVS V. S.</NOTE> declares his opinion very strongly that <HI>Belatucader</HI> was a local deity; tho' afterwards, when he came to speak of the <HI>Netherby</HI> altar above-mentioned, inscribed <HI>Deo Marti Belatucadro,</HI> forgetting what he had urged a few pages before of <HI>Belatucader</HI> being a local deity, he concurs with the author of the additions to <HI>Camden,</HI> in pro∣nouncing <HI>Belatucader</HI> a <HI>cognomen</HI> only of the god <HI>Mars.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dr Ward</HI> litigates this notion very ably, and observes from <HI>Selden</HI> and <HI>Vossius,</HI> that <HI>Belatucader</HI> was the same as <HI>Belenus,</HI> or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, whom both <HI>Herodian</HI> and <HI>Capitolinus</HI> affirm to be <HI>Apollo,</HI> who, it appears from <HI>Ausonius,</HI> was worshipped by the <HI>Druids. Dr Ward</HI> adds, "I cannot but incline to think, that this deity was <HI>Apollo,</HI> rather than <HI>Mars,</HI> both from the affinity of this name with other names of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and because I do not find the epithet <HI>sanctus</HI> ever given to <HI>Mars,</HI> and here the inscription runs <HI>Deo sancto Belatucadro."</HI></P>
<P>The fourth was inscribed also upon an altar found at <HI>Whelp Castle,</HI> a famous Roman station in <HI>Kirkby Thore, Westmoreland,</HI> and runs as in the margin.</P>
<P>This last corresponds exactly with mine,<NOTE PLACE="inter">DEO BELATVCAD RO. LIB. VOTV∣M FECIT IOLVS.</NOTE> being addressed simply to the god <HI>Be∣latucader (Deo Belatucadro.)</HI> Now as four out of five inscriptions, wherein <HI>Bela∣tucader</HI> occurs, have no adjunct but <HI>Deo. Dr Ward's</HI> conjecture, that the <HI>et</HI> in the <HI>Netherby</HI> inscription has been omitted by the transcriber, is strongly confirmed, and consequently <HI>Belatucader</HI> was not a <HI>cognomen</HI> of <HI>Mars,</HI> but either a local deity worshiped by the Romanised Britons in this part of the province, or another name for <HI>Apollo.</HI></P>

<HEAD>From the third volume of the Archaeologia, page <HI>101.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Something was said in the essay on the coins of <HI>Cunobelin,</HI> p. 15, on <HI>Belatucadrus,</HI> a deity either of the Romanised Britons, or of the Romans resident in Britain; and it was there asserted he was the same with <HI>Mars,</HI> being esteemed a local name of this deity. Since then an inscription, accompanied with a memoir, has been produced by my late most respectable friend <HI>Bishop Lyttleton,</HI> in which paper his Lordship, concurring with the late professor <HI>Ward,</HI> reckons him to be a local deity, as do most others, but with a reference to <HI>Apollo,</HI> who was worshipped, as they observe, by the Druids. And herein they have on their side <HI>Sammes. Selden, Hearne, Montfaucon,</HI> and the Authors of the Universal History. Notwithstanding the weight of all this authority, I see no reason to depart from my former assertion, and hope I may stand acquitted by the candid, if, in justification thereof, I here resume the further consideration of the subject.</P>
<P>It was said, 'the God of War seems to have had different names in various parts of the island; amongst the <HI>Trinobantes</HI> or <HI>Catuvellauni,</HI> to have been called <HI>Camulus;</HI> by the <HI>Brigantes, Belatucadrus;</HI> by the <HI>Coritani, Braciaca;</HI> and perhaps by others <HI>Hesus,</HI> or <HI>Esus?</HI> Now all the five inscriptions yet discovered concerning <HI>Belatucadrus,</HI> were found amongst the <HI>Brigantes;</HI> and the point to be discussed is, whether by this bar∣barous title was intended a local deity, answerable and equivalent to <HI>Apollo,</HI> or the god <HI>Mars,</HI> as <HI>Mr Baxter, Dr Gale, Mr Horsley</HI> in one place, and myself, have maintained.</P>
<P>Those who contend for <HI>Apollo,</HI> proceed upon the etymology; the application of the word <HI>sanctus,</HI> which they think becomes not <HI>Mars;</HI> and lastly a suspicion, that one of the inscriptions which runs <HI>Deo Marti Belatucadro</HI> is miswritten on the stone, and was intended to be <HI>Deo Marti et Belatucadro.</HI></P>
<P>They think, in the first place, they discover something of <HI>Belenus,</HI> or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the name of <HI>Apollo,</HI> in the term <HI>Belatucadrus.</HI> and so <HI>Mr Hearne</HI> interprets it of <HI>Apollo Sagittarius,</HI> on account, I presume, of the Greek word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. But surely little stress can be laid on this, since both <HI>Mr Baxter</HI> and <HI>Dr Gale</HI> have with equal, perhaps greater probability, deduced this name from the British, and have shewn it may be a very proper adjunct to <HI>Mars.</HI> The first analyses it <HI>'Bel at u cadr</HI> quod est, <HI>Belus et arcem montis;'</HI> and the second writes, 'Pos∣teriorque pars dictionis aliquid spirat istius numinis (martis scil.) cum <HI>Cad</HI> proelium, <HI>cader</HI> castrum, et <HI>cadr</HI> fortis <HI>Britannice</HI> sonent quae omnia Marti satis congruunt.' In the next place, as to the application of the word <HI>sanctus</HI> to <HI>Belatucadrus, Mars</HI> was a natural divinity with the Britons and Romans; the founder of Rome, as was pretended, descended from him, and as the <HI>'Rex hominum et deorum'</HI> was with them <HI>Jupiter,</HI> so the God of War was stiled <HI>Marspiter;</HI> and if <HI>Jupiter</HI> had his <HI>Flamen Dialis, Mars</HI> had his <HI>Flamen Martialis.</HI> The Britons, those who were Romanised, we may be assured, would adopt the like peculiar veneration for him. Besides, as <HI>Mars</HI> is so currently stiled <HI>Deus,</HI> where is the wonder that the term <HI>sanctus</HI> should be ap∣plied to him? It is apposite to every one of the Pagan deities, every object of their worship; for the Britons and Romans no doubt, est<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emed their deities holy, whatever we may think of them; and <HI>Belatucadrus</HI> is ex∣pressly stiled <HI>Deus</HI> in four of the five inscriptions. But what comes nearer to the point, nobody ever doubted but <HI>Camulus</HI> was a name of <HI>Mars;</HI> and yet we have an inscription in <HI>Gruter,</HI> which runs <HI>Camulo Deo sancto et fortissimo;</HI> which shews plainly there is not the least impropriety in giving the addition of <HI>sanctus</HI> to <HI>Mars</HI> or <HI>Belatucadrus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="inter">DEO SANG M ARTI, &amp;c.</NOTE> in our stone. But what is still more direct to the purpose, <HI>Mr Horsley,</HI> in Cumberland No. xxxv. has engraved a stone as in the margin, which he reads most properly <HI>Deo sancto Marti. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>It seems, lastly, that nothing can be effected on their side of the question, without a conjecture that a fault has been committed by the stone-cutter, and that the inscription was designed to have been <HI>Deo Marti et Belatucadro.</HI> This indeed is cutting the knot, but is doing at the same time the most palpable violence to the authority and sanctity of the stone. There is nothing more extraordinary in <HI>Deo Marti Belatucadro,</HI> than in <HI>Deo Marti Braciacae,</HI> as we have it in the <HI>Haddon</HI> inscription, adduced in <HI>Camden.</HI> and the essay on the coins of <HI>Cunobelin,</HI> p. 17, or <HI>Marti Camulo</HI> in <HI>Gruter</HI> and <HI>Montsaucon.</HI> Now, upon this footing, viz. the integrity and correctness of the stone, <HI>Mars</HI> is expressly called <HI>Belatucadrus,</HI> and this is admirably confirmed by the testimony of <HI>Richard</HI> of <HI>Cirencesler,</HI> p. 9, <HI>'Hinc Apollinem, Martem, qui etiam Vitucadrus appellehatur, Jovem Minervam—venerabantur, candem fere de his numinibus ac quidem aliae gentes opinionem amplexi?</HI> Insomuch that it seems to me highly absurd to look out for any other deity in <HI>Belatucadrus,</HI> but the god <HI>Mars.</HI> That he was a local deity, peculiar in this island to the <HI>Brigantes,</HI> is not denied; but then we assert him to be equivalent to <HI>Mars,</HI> and to have been invested with the same powers as that God, and not to have had the least concern with <HI>Apollo.</HI> or any relation to him, as his Lordship and Professor Ward contend.</P>

<P>This altar was also since found at <HI>Plumpton,</HI> and communicated to the author by a gentleman of Cumberland. It is still more cu∣rious than the former, and probably from its mixed dedication, may draw some further opinions from antiquaries.</P>
<P>Dedications to the god <HI>Magon</HI> have been recovered in the Roman stations in <HI>Northumberland,</HI> one in particular <HI>Mr Horsley</HI> says, <HI>Camden</HI> justly supposes to have been erected to the topical god <HI>Magon,</HI> worshiped by the <HI>Cadeni</HI> or <HI>Gadeni,</HI> a neighbouring people of the <HI>Citadini.</HI> See a particular account of these inscriptions to the <HI>View of Northumberland,</HI> p. 181, &amp;c.</P></NOTE> The Gadeni, who occupied the high lands north of Tyne, had their Magon.</P>
<P>The garments of the Brigantes were like those of the other northern Britons, rude and uncouth, and seldom consisted of more than the skins of wolves, cast over the left shoulder, and girded on with leathern thongs. After navigation obtained among the Germans, and they had frequent intercourse with this island, the Britons learned to manufacture wool, and the hair of goats, which at first, with infinite toil, they beat and wrought together, forming a kind of felt, of which the most opulent wore caps and cassocks, or loose gowns, bound round the waist, with a belt. Their ornaments were barbarous as the times, large and cumbrous rings of iron, chains round the waist, heavy bands of brass
<PB N="v" REF="11"/>or copper as bracelets, on their legs and arms. When the Romans deserted this island, the Britons are described as being ignorant of the art of working metals, and making arms; so that their uncouth ornaments must either have been procured from foreigners, or the people had forgot the art. The intercourse with the Germans, who traded or pirated on our coasts, would introduce brass and iron instruments for war; and those settlers on the shores, which the Ro∣mans found practising tillage, must have brought with them many instruments long afterwards unknown to the people who lived a Scythian life in the interior parts of the country, and for some ages refused to commune with them. The ut∣most elegance of the Brigantian fashion is described in the dress of Boadicea, and part of that might be borrowed perhaps from the Romans: Her hair was of a deep yellow, a colour of such estimation that dyes were used to heighten it. This princess wore it very long, hanging down to the bottom of her back. Her neck was adorned with a massy chain of gold, and she was habited in a tunic interwoven with various colours, over which was a robe, of coarser tex∣ture, bound round her waist with a girdle, and fastened with buckles. The im∣provements in dress need not be traced, as the Romans gradually introduced their own fashions; and as we hear of no linen in the dress of this princess, it is natural to conclude, it was then even unknown to the Brigantes.</P>
<PB N="vi" REF="12"/>
<P>Their chief strength in the field was in their war-chariots, which they managed with great dexterity, driving them furiously on the lines of the enemy, and turning them swiftly on the beam, thereby charging and retreating with incredible rapidity. The wheels were armed with hooks, and the warriors discharged their missive weapons from the carriage. At this mode of fighting they are represented to have been so expert, as seldom to miss giving a mortal wound to the enemy. The body of the troops was armed with javelins and
<PB N="vii" REF="13"/>targets, some few but not till this time, with poignards, and others with heavy two-edged swords. They fought in a tumultuous manner, and both charged and retreated without order or dicipline.</P>
<P>Their permanent habitations were in the forests, crowded together without order or regularity. The village, or rude assemblage of huts, was defended by a mound of loose stones, piled up in a ridge, which was strengthened by a ditch on the outside, and logs of timber heaped up in confusion, by way of barri∣cado, formed the out-work. One of these fortifications in this county, shall
<PB N="viii" REF="14"/>hereafter be described, the rampart of which it is not easy even at this day to climb. Their summer huts being erected for the convenience of pasturage, con∣sisted of a few poles, placed in a circular form, wattled with branches, and covered with turf.</P>
<P>So much it appears necessary to have said of our British ancestors. They who would examine more minutely into their life and manners, may resort to Tacitus, Diodorus Siculus, Caesar, Strabo, Tacitus, Herodian, and others of the ancients; or to Rowland's Mona Antiqua, Stukeley, Borlase, Strutt, Dr Henry's History of Britain, and many more of the moderns, who have drawn from the same sources.</P>
<P>The Romans seem to have been satisfied with the subduction of the southern parts of Britain, until the reign of Vespasian, who sent Petelis Cerialis to govern the province: He found that his predecessors, particularly Trebellius, had not exerted themselves in making new conquests, but had contented themselves with maintaining what had been previously gained, and that too, by conciliating the minds of the natives to new modes of life, by which they were for a time lulled into passiveness and submission. But as these practices could contaminate
<PB N="ix" REF="15"/>only such as had an intimate intercourse with the Romans, a detestation of bon∣dage, and the innate love of liberty, broke out in many places at a distance from the Roman garrisons, and secret cabals were held unnoticed by the incautious legions. In a life of inactivity and softness, the rigour of discipline being re∣laxed, the Roman soldiers gave into the most dangerous innovations on duty, and were become almost ripe for revolt. Had the Britons seized this propitious moment, they might perhaps have shaken off the yoke, and maintained their independency. For Caelius who commanded the 20th legion, entertaining a strong antipathy to Trebellius, encouraged the spirit of faction in the soldiers, well knowing their particular attachment to himself, and at length a powerful party appeared in arms against their leader; but by means of early intelligence Trebellius had time to secure himself by flight. In his absence Caelius assumed the chief command, and with a true military spirit kept the province in good or∣der. Trebellius, however had sufficient interest at the Imperial Court to get himself restored, but soon after fell into the same state of languor and inactivity, through which a total anarchy threatened the Roman affairs in Britain. Vitellius alarmed at such a critical situation, notwithstanding the civil conflicts at Rome, with Vespasian, paid early attention to this important member of the empire,
<PB N="x" REF="16"/>and dispatched Bolanus, to take upon him the command. Possessed of few mi∣litary accomplishments, but of a placid turn of mind, with manners highly po∣lished, his endeavours seem to have been to captivate the affections of the Britons. Such a conduct, tho' well adapted to polished states, gave too much liberty to the turbulent minds of uncultivated men, to devise new projects, and conceal their secret machinations. At this time it was that Vitellius dispatched messen∣gers to Britain, commanding a detachment from thence to his assistance in Rome: Had this been complied with, the Britons would have again had a favourable opportunity to shake off the yoke; but Bolanus, either from a secret attach∣ment to Vespasian, or rather on account of the intelligence he had gained of the cabals in the interior parts of this island, returned for answer, that the turbulent and unsteady disposition of the uncultivated natives, who still possessed the heights and natural strong holds, was such, that with all the force he had, and the courtesy he exercised, he was just able to keep the province in peace; and that if any troops should be withdrawn, it would hazard the entire loss of a country won at the expence of so much time, treasure, and bloodshed.</P>
<P>Vespasian's success in the empire was scarce well established, when he turned his thoughts upon this island. Adventurous and of a military cast of mind,
<PB N="xi" REF="17"/>his choice of officers was suited to his own disposition: He sent Cerialis to take the command, who, in an ardour for honour, looked on the annals of his predecessors with contempt, estimating their years of ease as lost to the state, regarding with jealousy the unsubdued and savage nations in the northern parts of Britain, and determined to reap his laurels from their subjugation. Fraught with this idea, he brought the army under strict discipline, and fortified the garrisons with every military art: Despising meaner states, he made war upon the most powerful. The Brigantes were his first object. The petty states, regarding them as invincible, stood astonished at his teme∣rity. Many bloody conflicts were the consequence, in which regular order and dicipline insured success to the Romans, and the greatest part of the country soon became abandoned to the victorious legions, who marked the progress of their conquest with the most horrid devastations.</P>
<P>The historians who speak of this time, do not allot to this scourge of the Brigantes above five years, for in the year 75 we find Julius Frontinus had the command, who, pursuing the maxims of his predecessor, carried his arms against the Silures.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by Julius Agricola, who had fought under the victorious Petilius Cerialis, and to whose valour and wise conduct, much of the suc∣cess of Cerialis is attributed. Far from indulging in repose after his arrival, Tacicus says, he drew out his army, even after the decline of summer, and marched against the Ordovices, who, some short time before, had put to the sword a troop of horse, they had surprised. Not intimidated by this people keeping within their fortifications, in the bosoms of intricate forests, and sur∣rounded
<PB N="xii" REF="18"/>with morasses, or possessing strong holds on the lofty mountains, he pressed his troops forward, encouraging them by his intrepid example, and disgracing their fears by leading them to the charge in the most adventurous attempts. He did not linger in the plains, making efforts to draw the enemy to open battle, but assailed their intrenchments, and by mounting the ramparts of their strongest fortresses, taught the astonished foe to believe nothing was superior to Roman valour. Such was the effect of this intrepidity, and such the emulation his example inspired, that his forces were invincible, and every place submitted to his arms. And the campaign being over, we find him as great in the closet as in the field. He inspected narrowly into the method of collecting the tribute, and corrected such abuses as he discovered whereby the Britons were oppressed, and abolished sundry grievous exactions, which had been imposed without authority. He inspected all the public offices, and put the several services, which the allied states were bound to perform, on a more liberal and equal plan. He had public days, on which he heard the complaints of all, and rewarded or punished with impartiality, temperance and moderation: Such was his political conduct, that all whom he had subdued by his sword, were held in obedience by his mild and prudent administration. Thus he employed the winter, and no sooner was summer set in, than he took the field, and by the rapid movements of his army, harassed the distressed multitudes who were still in arms against him.—When an interval of peace permitted, he invited the chiefs of each friendly state to entertainments, and laboured incessantly to inculcate a love of the sciences; insinuated a taste for Roman elegance, built them mansions and temples; introduced them to shews, magnisicent sports, and the pomp of religious ceremonies, and at length taught them a relish for modes of living, of which till then, they could form no conception: It was thus that the ferocity of the Britons was subdued, and it soon became the fashion for young men of rank to be under the tuition of Roman preceptors, and to wear the Roman habit. And such was the good understanding that now obtained, that several states voluntarily submitted, gave hostages for their fidelity, and assented to fortresses being erected, and garrisoned with Roman soldiers. Whether the Ottadini and Gadeni were of those states that thus acceded; or whether the line of stations from the eastern to the western ocean, were those mentioned by Tacitus, is no part of our inquiry; suffice it to say, that all that district, which is the subject of the present narrative, was in the year 80 under the administration of Agricola; and it is not im∣probable but from this great man's policy, many of those customs which shew their remains at this day, were dispensed to the people.</P>
<P>This district was not insured of peace under the protection of the Roman arms; it was unhappy in its vicinity to the contentious northern tribes, who in roving bands, on every occasion, were giving disturbance to the Roman government. The fortresses raised by Agricola indeed, kept them in awe; and from the time that he was recalled from his government in the
<PB N="xiii" REF="19"/>year 85, to 117, historians are silent as to British affairs; and it seems pro∣bable, that after the quiet and repose of the Brigantes under Agricola's admini∣stration, and the dreadful overthrow of the northern Britons on the Gram∣pian hills, the miserable remains of the latter were not able to make any considerable head. But in the space of thirty years a new generation suc∣ceeded, tutored from their infancy to entertain an implacable hatred to the Roman name; and from their earliest years disciplined in acts of rapine and plun∣der, as knowing few other means of procuring a subsistence.</P>
<P>For about the time that Hadrian succeeded to the empire, these restless tribes grew more formidable and adventrous; they made their appearance in large bodies, and drawing nearer the frontiers, occasioned such an alarm, that the province solicited an immediate reinforcement from the continent. Julius Severus came over with supplies, and by his vigorous measures the banditti were soon repressed, and forced to seek for safety in their own barren and inhospitable mountains.</P>
<P>It was unhappy for the Brigantes, and in a less degree for the more southern parts of Britain to have been infested with these inroads of the northern tribes, who seem to have been actuated by the same principle that induced the Scandinavians, and other northern nations, to quit a barren country, and wish for a settlement in a fertile one. Nor is it to be won∣dered at, when, at this very day, when the whole island of Britain is united under the same government, we see that the inhabitants of the northern parts, when once they make a settlement in the southern, seldom express any desire of returning to their native country.</P>
<P>It would be an uninteresting narrative to follow the succession of Roman commanders, and the various incidents which marked the several periods of their authority: The irruptions of the northern nations, and the repeated ravage and destruction with which they marked their progress, would not appear sufficiently momentous to excuse to the reader, the repitition of hor∣rid description. As it was observed before, this territory was subject to great jeopardy from its situation, and notwithstanding those august works, the pretenturae of Hadrian and Severus, it suffered repeated depredations. But these were not the only calamities of the Brigantes. For about the year 285, the Franks and Saxons infested the coasts with innumerable barks, employed in pillage and every outrageous act of piracy. The Britons in their intercourse with Gaul, had increased their shipping, and under the instruc∣tions of the Romans improving in the knowledge of navigation, carried on much intercourse and trade with the opposite shores; so that hostilities of this nature were a dreadful check to their growing commerce and improv∣ing manufactures. The luxuries of life increasing, foreign articles grew into high estimation, and the love of traffic advanced vigorously: The fer∣tility of Britain afforded a staple of the utmost consequence to the opposite continent, and the mountains supplied another; for their corn, cattle and wool, various commodities were received in exchange, and by the rapid in∣crease
<PB N="xiv" REF="20"/>of their shipping, the ballance of trade seems to have been greatly in their favor.</P>
<P>Maximianus, who shared the Imperial dignity with Dioclesian, paid an early attention to this new grievance, and fitted out Carausius with a power∣ful sleet to scour the seas. Historians have imputed to his character a de∣gree of treachery, which the future events of his life do not seem to sup∣port. He is said to have studied to enrich himself, and that he never at∣tacked the pirates but on their return, that he might possess their booty. This accusation appears to have arisen from envy; but yet so powerfully was it represented to Maximianus, that he issued orders to put him to death. Carausius having intelligence of the destruction decreed against him, called a council of the naval officers, who loved him for his bravery and generous spirit, and represented to them the injustice done his charcter, and the violence of the Emperor's sentence; on which they unanimously joined him in a revolt, and the whole fleet making immediately for Britain, where he was equally beloved by the army, he suffered himself to be proclaimed Emperor. If he had been conscious of the crime imputed to him; or if the Britons had suffered by his avarice and misconduct, it is scarce probable he would have repaired to them to proclaim his intentions of severing the pro∣vince from the Imperial jurisdiction, and of becoming himself the Emperor.</P>
<P>Maximianus startled at this audacious act, yet prudently weighing in his mind the strength of Carausius, who had concluded a peace with the Saxons, and entered into an alliance with them, for a while put on a countenance of compliance, and confirmed him in his government of Britain with the title of Emperor. Thus established, Carausius enjoyed his dignity for some years in peace; which time he spent in strengthening his frontiers against the northern nations, building new forts, and repairing the pretenturae of Hadrian. At the same time he was not negligent of his naval power; having discovered the true strength of the island, he kept his ships in exercise, and encouraged trade as a nursery for his navy. Maximianus breathing ven∣geance against him, and having increased his navy, prepared to attack Bri∣tain, under the conduct of Constantius Chlorus; but before this comman∣der could leave the coasts of Gaul, Carausius was slain at York by Alectus, whom he had considered as his intimate friend. It is not easy to account for the motive of the latter, but as he was soon after proclaimed Carausius's successor, and as Constantius declined his purpose of invading Britain, it seems as if Alectus was the instrument of Maximianus's revenge.</P>
<P>From some succeeding circumstances, it is probable the provincial Britons were much against this severance from the empire, that they were not well affected either to Carausius or his successor, and that they detested the al∣liance with the Saxons, who had interfered with their navigation, and robbed them of the sweets of traffic with the continent. For Alectus had enjoyed his new dignities only about three years, when Constantius set out on an ex∣pedition to depose him. The events which ensued were various, but Alectus
<PB N="xv" REF="21"/>falling in the field, they terminated at length to the honour of Constantius; who, through a series of fortunate circumstances, restored peace to Britain, and reunited her to the empire, after a severance of about ten years.— The Saxons, after the defeat of Alectus, attempted every species of rapine and pillage; till being worsted in several conflicts, most of them were put to the sword, or fled the land. The seas now cleared of pirates, a free trade and safe navigation were again opened; so that the Britons considered Constantius as a guardian angel, and he was so sincerely affected towards them, that upon the resignation of Dioclesian and Maximianus, and the di∣vision of the empire between himself and Galerius, he chose to take up his residence among them; and died at York in 305, soon after his return from a Caledonian expedition.</P>
<P>Constantinus succeeded his father, being his eldest son, by Helena, a native of Britain, a woman of inestimable virtues: He reduced and brought to obe∣dience the northern states; and under his government, Britain appears to have enjoyed great tranquility for upwards of thirty years.</P>
<P>Constans the second son, having defeated his brother Constantinus, who made war upon him to gain the share of dominion allotted by his father, in the beginning of the year 343 visited Britain, and repressed the insur∣gents in the north, who again infested the frontiers. From the many vices he was a slave to, and his exhausted revenues, he was urged to impose oppressive exactions on his provinces, and Britain groaned under a heavy tribute; but it was of no long continuance, as he was soon after deposed and slain. Nor did Magnentius, whom the soldiers chose for his successor, long enjoy his exaltation: Dreading the vengeance of Constantinus, brother to the deposed emperor, he fell upon his sword, at Lyons, and put an end to his life.</P>
<P>About the year 360 the flourishing state of Britain, from increased com∣merce, improved manufactures, and great influx of wealth, induced the northern tribes to assemble and make fresh attacks; and such was their power, that they passed the pretenturae of Hadrian and Severus, and with a rapid course advanced into the southern parts, reaping immense booty; so that Julianus, the governor of Gaul, was under the necessity of sending over a body of forces under Lupinus; on whose approach these northern plun∣derers retired with precipitation. But this was a short respite, for in the year 364, immediately after Valentinian had assumed the purple, the northern tribes taking advantage of the perturbed state of the southern parts of the island, occasioned by the plundering Saxons, appeared in greater num∣bers than ever. For three successive years they prevailed in spite of the Roman arms, and advanced as far as London, before a stop was put to their career by Theodosius, whom Valentinian sent over on this emergency. The devastation they had committed, and the desolation with which they had marked their progress were tremendous. A bloody engagement ensued, in which they were routed with vast slaughter; the Roman general being
<PB N="xvi" REF="22"/>irritated to great severities, mercy was extended to few; and the spoils with which they had enriched themselves, were restored to the miserable inhabitants whom they had plundered. He pursued his victory with unre∣mitting vengeance, and the scattered remains of the enemy fled before him to the mountains. And having recovered the forts on the most distant frontiers, he repaired them, and restored their military establishments; the chain of stations on the pretenturae of Hadrian and Severus he strengthen∣ed with new works, which having accomplished, he put the whole district between the lines, under military orders, as a distinct province, to which he gave the name of Valentia. Those things effected, he employed the hours of peace in re-edifying, or constructing forts in the most needful situations, making great regulations in the army, and reforming several abuses in go∣vernment; especially reducing the exactions under which the Britons were oppressed, and restoring the tribute to its original equality. His benevolence descended in the next place to private bounties; he relieved the distressed; he rebuilt their mansions, repaired their cities, added new works to their fortifications, paid the utmost attention to their ports and havens, reformed their shipping with modern improvements, put their foreign traffic on the most advantageous footing, and protected it with a powerful naval force. Such happy effects immediately succeeded his measures, that the province re∣assumed the countenance of opulence and felicity. Having accomplished those great works, this guardian of Britain (from whose wisdom and excellent government more benefits were derived, than from any of his predecessors) returned to Rome, leaving an indelible affection in the hearts of the islanders, with whom the name of Theodosius was held in universal veneration.— Peace for several years succeeded those excellent establishments. Military order strictly maintained in the north, held the people in awe, and the naval force which the Provincials kept up, totally repressed the Saxon pirates.</P>
<P>About the year 380, the Britons had the misfortune to embark in a destructive project: Presuming to support Maximus their governor, in his pretensions to the empire, the flower of their youth were embodied in the army, with which he passed over into Gaul, determined to share in his am∣bitious expectations. The consequence was dreadful: His pursuits were un∣fortunate, and in his ruin were overwhelmed his British followers, who either falling by the sword, or becoming wanderers in a foreign country, never regained their native shores. Drained of its strength and wealth, Britain lay exposed to its watchful enemies, who in the year 393, availing themselves of the public calamity, ravaged the northern parts; whilst the Saxons distressed the southern. Theodosius, sirnamed the Great, son of the excellent patron of Britain, having attained the whole empire, by the death of his colleague Valentinian, sent forces to their relief, and soon restored peace.</P>
<P>The succeeding distraction in the Roman state brought with it new miseries to the Britons: Various were their distresses, before Constantine, who was
<PB N="xvii" REF="23"/>elevated to the sceptre from a low station, wrought the destruction of this province, by enlisting under his banner all the youth he could allure with visions of glory, to participate his fortunes, The recent example of Maxi∣mus and his retainers, had no influence on the minds of the people; but they were precipitated to their ruin, and compleated the wretchedness of their country, by an attachment to this adventurer, whose early gleams of prosperous fortune soon forsook him.</P>
<P>About the year 413 this island was deserted of the Romans; Victorinus their general, with all the Imperial troops being withdrawn to support Honorius, and protect the remnant of the shaken empire from the universal wreck, which was threatened by surrounding enemies. This was too favourable a moment for the restless northern tribes not to sally forth from their hiding places, and make new inroads; to oppose which, Honorius being solicited for succour, was under a necessity of shewing his own weakness, by de∣claring it was not in his power to send them any assistance; and renouncing all claim to their allegiance, he recommended to them to shake off that supineness, which had crept in upon them under the protection of Roman arms, to reassume the courage of their ancestors, and recover their spirits from the depression which had overwhelmed them in the abjectness of vassalage. Such exhortations had no other effect than to produce de∣jection and despair. The few Romans who had made connections with them, and remained in Britain after the army was withdrawn, foreseeing the de∣solation that was at hand, sold their effects, and departed the country, to seek for secure habitations under some settled government.</P>
<P>Great was the misery of the Britons at this crisis! Swarms of hungry and insatiable assailants pouring forth from every quarter over the abandoned land, without mercy and desperate from want! The mountains and the forests sent forth their tens of thousands, all eager for pillage, and anxious for revenge; for they regarded all within the Pretenturae as Romans, on account of their old attachment. The people thus invaded, bereft of their councellors and protectors, were agitated like the forest torn by tempests; inconstant in every resolution, each instable determination was revoked as soon as formed; without money, without a leader, and without virtue and strength of mind, from whence alone courage proceeds. In this deplorable state, they fell under the sword of their vindictive enemies, or fled before them in despair. Under such extreme calamity, they again dispatched mes∣sengers to Rome, when Honorius sent a legion to their relief, with whose aid the foe was once more repressed. This legion helped to repair the Pre∣tenturae, and taught them various arts necessary for their safety and com∣fort; instructing them in the general rules of architecture, fortification, and the dispositions to be practised in the army; but particularly taught them the art of making arms and other instruments of metal. These things per∣formed, the victorious legion returned to Rome.</P>
<P>It was not long before the enemy appeared again, when they made a
<PB N="xviii" REF="24"/>breach in the northern wall, and advanced with their usual barbarity.—The little respite the Britons had enjoyed, only served to overwhelm them in a deeper dejection of spirits: They neglected the means their own strength offered, and again applied to Honorius, who sent such forces to their relief, as gave a total overthrow to the ravagers. Satiated with slaughter, and willing to render the utmost assistance in their power to the distressed coun∣try, they proceeded to repair the wall of Severus with firm mason-work, and restored the ramparts and outworks; and in order to secure the coasts against a foreign enemy, they assisted in building several sorts and strong holds in the most advantageous situations.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been imagined that <HI>Bambrough</HI> in Northumberland was originally one of those sorts, the base of the present tower being of a very different mode of architecture from the superstructure, and such as the Saxons or Normans did not use. It is Doric; but Mr <HI>Grose</HI> does not find any difficulty in admitting it might be the work of the Normans, as most of their architects learned their art at Rome, and shews an instance of the Ionic order being followed in part of their edifices at Canterbury. The reader will determine for himself in this matter; it is known, that the Ro∣mans erected <HI>nine</HI> forts of this kind on the more southern coasts of Britain: The second detach∣ment of Honorius restored the wall of Severus with mason-work, and perhaps might build the tower of Bambrough similar to the nine before mentioned, the better to secure the northern terri∣tories against the German rovers who infested the coast. At least the Doric order appearing here, and in no other Norman tower in the north, where several still remain, it gives a probability that the original structure at Bambrough was Roman. The Notitia Imperii, cap. 52, points out the <HI>nine</HI> sorts, but takes no notice of this, nor was it to be expected if we date this edifice in the time of Honorius. Many of the northern stations, whose remains are yet to be seen, are not to be found in the Notitia.</NOTE></P>
<P>These things being accomplished, the Roman General bid adieu to Britain; but before his departure, exhorted the inhabitants to use their utmost ef∣forts for the defence of their country, <Q>You are neither (says he) inferior in “muscular strength or stature, to those with whom you have to contend, nor are your endowments of mind of meaner quality; experience will teach you knowledge;—victory depends on your own virtue.—It is valour alone must sustain you; and the force of arms must be your security. You have possessions to fight for, the reward of which is sweeter than the fruits of rapine, and more to be desired.—With the advantage of such fortifications as we have left you, you are, if you use the means, much su∣perior ”to your foes.</Q></P>
<P>As the distracted state of the Empire had obliged Honorius to give up all pretensions to sovereignty, some time before, so now on the recall of his forces in the year 420, the Romans took a final leave of this island, just 475 years after they had first set foot upon it: And as Christianity had long been not only openly professed in most of the capital cities of the Empire, but had for some time been under the protection of the civil magistrate, even in the remoter provinces; it is natural to conclude it must have made some progress in this island, not only by its own intrinsic excellence, and the labours of those commissioned to preach it, but also by that free and familiar intercourse that had long subsisted, between the Britons and the Roman soldiers, many of whom had fought under the banner of the cross. The reader will therefore, at this important period, expect some account of the state of <HI>Religion</HI> in Britain.</P>
<PB N="xix" REF="25"/>
<P>William of Malmsbury's account of Joseph of Aramathea visiting Britain, and founding the first Christian church at Glastonbury, has been deservedly rejected as fable. Eusebius who was present at the council of Nice, and was an historian of some reputation, gives testimony of the Christian faith having gained a footing in Britain in a very early age of the church; and from him too we are told that some of the Apostles preached to the Britons, who are spoken of by Theodoret a bishop of the 5th century, as having been converted by St Paul. Clemens Romanus, a cotemporary with the Apostles, says, that St Paul preached to the utmost bounds to the west; which in the common language of the times, implied the British isles.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ultimos orbis Britannos.—Horace.</NOTE>—But this phrase may import, that the apostle sent forth bishops to convert the people; and it is presumed by some writers, that the Christian faith was promulgated, and many converts made before the defeat of Boadicea. Aristobulus a bishop ordained by St Paul, is said to have been a missionary in Britain, and to have suffered martyrdom about the year 56. Tacitus tells us, <Q>That Pomponia Graecina, the wife of Aulus Plautius, the legate “of Claudius, was accused of foreign superstition, and for which she was ”tried for her life, she having, as is asserted, embraced the Christian faith.</Q></P>
<P>It has been conjectured, that Claudia mentioned by St Paul in his second epistle to Timothy, was the British lady, celebrated by the poet Martial, by the name of Claudia Rufina, the wife of Pudeus.</P>
<P>Tertullian who lived in the time of Caracalla, says, <Q>That Christianity “”had made its way into Britain;</Q> and to name no more of the ancients, Origen, who died in the year 253, says in his 6th homily, <Q>The power “of our Saviour's kingdom reached as far as Britain, which seemed to lie ”in another division of the world.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Et penitus toto divisos orbe Britannos.—Virgil.</NOTE></P>
<P>To proceed to later authorities, Bede's words are,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Bede's Hist. cap. 4.</NOTE> <Q>In the year of our “Lord 156, Marcus Aurelius Verus, the 14th emperor after Augustus, reigned with his brother Aurelius Commodus, as his colleague, in whose time Eleutherius a godly man, was pope of the Roman church, Lucius king of Britain wrote to him, desiring, under his direction he might be taught the principles of Christianity; the holy father immediately complied with this pious request, and the Britons then received the faith, and preserved the ”same in peace until the reign of Dioclesian.</Q>—What authority this vener∣able, but credulous historian, had for this account of Lucius, it is now im∣possible to say. But that there once lived a prince of this name, and most probably in this island, one may venture to presume as well from the old book of Llandaff, as from two coins mentioned by Archbishop Usher, one silver and the other gold, the last of which was part of Sir Robert Cotton's collection, and examined by the primate, bearing the impress of
<PB N="xx" REF="26"/>cross, and that it was the king in question, was concluded from the letters LVC.—Dr Stillingfleet was of opinion, that Lucius's kingdom was in Surry and Sussex.—Bauterne gives the print of another coin representing a man's head, and on the reverse a boar and a star, the inscription LVCIO.</P>
<P>It is generally believed that no opposition was made to the Christian doctrine in Britain, from the period before mentioned, to the reign of Dioclesian. This emperor jealous that the new faith would weaken his authority, published an edict in the year 303 for pulling down churches, and burning the holy scriptures, declaring, that no Christian should be ca∣pable of any office or post of honour; that they should be outlawed and deprived of the privilege of suit; and that no rank or quality should ex∣cuse them from torture.—Constantius Chlorus was then governor of Britain, a favourer of Christianity, and specially effected towards the Britons, yet under the directions of his sovereign, was obliged to put the edict in exe∣cution; but in 305 becoming emperor himself, there was an end of the persecution. For a particular account of the distressed Christians in Britain during this horrid period, the reader is referred to Gildas. Among the several martyrs were St Alban, Aaron, and Julius. Constantius encouraged the British Christians to return from their places of concealment, permitted them to rebuild their churches, and renew their religious assemblies and ceremonies.</P>
<P>From the council of Arles it appears, that three British bishops subscribed canons of that council, viz. Eborius of York, Restitutus of London, and Adelfius of Lincoln. It also appears that the Bishop of Rome was not pre∣sent, but that the decrees were transmitted to him, with this address, "to our dear brother the Bishop of Rome."</P>
<P>It does not appear that any British bishops were at the council of Nice, though at the council of Sardica in 347, they joined in full condemnation of the doctrine of Arius, on account of which the council of Nice had been summoned. It is observed by most writers on our ecclesiastical history, that at this council, the first instance appears of the supreme authority of Rome, to receive appeals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The motion made by Hosius, was to the following purport. <Q>If any bishop should conceive “himself injured by the sentence of the neighbouring bishops, and desire to be reheard; if you please, in respect to the memory of St Peter, let those bishops who have pronounced judgment, write to Julius Bishop of Rome, and transmit a copy of their proceedings to him, and if he thinks it pro∣per that the cause should be tried over again, let him assign judges for that purpose: But if he is satisfied with what is done, and declares against a reversal, let his sentence shall good and ”determine the point.</Q> To this the council replied,—"They were content."—<HI>Concil. Labbe Tom. u.</HI> p. 629, 645.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the year 359 at the council of Ariminum, the British bishops were present, and though this council was charged with favouring Arianism, yet St Hillary acquits the British prelates, and says, that assembling at Paris to∣gether with the Gallican bishops, they protested against the decrees of that council, and gave a confirmatory assent to those of the council at Nice, and
<PB N="xxi" REF="27"/>he had also in his book, de Synodis, the year before born téstimony to their orthodoxy. Three of the bishops were in such necessitous circumstances, oc∣casioned perhaps by the incursions of the northern tribes, that they were subsisted for the time at the Emperor's expence.</P>
<P>Though the British prelates were at this time acknowledged to be or∣thodox, yet Pelagianism, first countenanced in Gaul, and from thence brought into Britain, made a rapid progress, and gave no little concern to the or∣thodox. This, however, tells to the credit of the Britons, that they begun in this early period to think and enquire for themselves. It would be tak∣ing too great a liberty to assert, that they readily imbibed the doctrine, because Morgan, who took the name of Pelagius, being their countryman, was the founder of a sect amongst them, whose tenets were from him called Pelagianism; and which are so well known that it would be an affront to the reader, to give them in detail. And it may be further observed, that the right of private judgment so far prevailed in behalf of Pelagius's tenets, that the Gallican bishops, alarmed at this innovation on what they esteemed orthodoxy, sent over Germanus and Lupus, as missionaries to re∣claim the Pelagians, but what was their success is uncertain.</P>
<P>The first northern bishop named by historians is St Ninian, who fixed his residence at Whithern in Galloway; which afterwards during the Saxon heptarchy, was a member of the kingdom of Northumberland. He is said to have consecrated several bishops, and divided that country into districts and parishes.</P>
<P>After this brief account of the state of religion, and of the church, it may not be amiss to say a few words on the interior police of the Britons at this period.</P>
<P>From the reign of Claudius, the <HI>Imperial Laws</HI> were common in this island, and took place as far north as Brigantia.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ille Britannos—Ultra noti—Litora Ponti Et caeruleos—senta Brigantes—dare Romuleis Colla Catenis—jussit et ipsum—nova Romanae Jura securis—Tremere Occanum.—<HI>Seneca in Lude de Morte Claud.

<P>That emperor erected courts of justice after the Roman form. Eutropius says, <Q>That Maldon was made a strong garrison, and veteran troops were “settld in the neighbourhood, to awe the Britons against a revolt, and ”to constrain them to submit to the Roman laws.</Q> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tacitus mentioning the state of the colony at Camulodunum, when Suetonius Paulinus had com∣mand, takes notice, "that there were foreign voices heard in the sessions house."—<HI>Annal.

<P>On Agricola's reducing the northern parts, it is natural to presume, he extended the legal jurisdiction, along with his conquests; and an abolition of the laws of the country would be the consequence. From whence, it is no wonder, that little or nothing is now known of the laws by which the people of this island were governed before the Roman conquest, because
<PB N="xxii" REF="28"/>the Druids, the British legislators, trusted all their precepts, as well civil as religious, to memory alone, as indeed, according to Spelman, did also the early Saxons. From whence it may be inferred, that all that has been wrote on many of the English laws being derived from so early a period, as by some antiquarians is contended for, is at least problematical.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Blackstone in his commentaries says, <Q>Our ancient lawyers (and particularly Fortescue) insist “with abundance of warmth, that these customs are as old as the primitive Britons, and continued down through the several mutations of government and inhabitants to the present time unchanged and unadulterated." This may be the case, as to some, but in general, as Mr Sciden in his notes observes, this assertion must be understood with many grains of allowance; and ought only to sig∣nify, as the truth seems to be, that there never was any formal exchange of one system of laws for another; though doubtless by the intermixture of adventitious nations, the Romans, the Picts, the Saxons, the Danes and the Normans, they must have insensibly introduced and incorporated many of their own customs with those that were before established; thereby in all probability im∣proving the texture and wisdom of the whole, by the accumulated wisdom of divers particular countries. Our laws, faith Lord Bacon, are mixed like our language; and as our language is so ”much the richer, the laws are the more compleat.</Q>
<P><Q>“And indeed our antiquarians and first historians do all possitively assure us, that our body of laws is of this compounded nature. For they tell us, that in the time of Alfred, the local customs of the several provinces of the kingdom, were grown so various, that he found it expedient to compile his dome-book or liber judicialis, for the general use of the whole kingdom. This book ”is said to have been extant so late as the reign of Edward IV. but is now unfortunately lost.</Q></P></NOTE></P>
<P>After this digression on the state of religion and police, the reader need not be put in mind of the distressed condition of the Britons, when no longer under the protection of the Romans, and every day pillaged and plundered by northern invaders.

And it seems to have been not only with the consent of the Britons, but by express invitation that the Saxons were to make settlements in the island, as it does not appear, that any other gratuity was stipulated for their services.</P>
<P>The number that came over at first is said to have been only 1500, and to have had the isle of Jhanet allotted them. Whatever was their number, they are said to have performed very signal services under Vortigern, whom the Britons, after the Roman mode of government had advanced to sovereignty. The northern invaders, having desolated the country were attacked by Vortigern and his Saxon auxiliaries at Stamford, when a dreadful conflict ensued, in which the the invaders were routed with great slaughter; their light arms could not bear up, against the bucklers, axes and scymitars of the Saxons. By this victory, which was justly attributed to the auxiliaries and wise disposition of the array,
<PB N="xxiii" REF="29"/>the Britons were restored to their possessions, and many a miserable sufferer was in some measure recompensed for his losses by the spoils which the dispersed and broken remains of the enemy left in the field.</P>
<P>Such was the joy of the Britons, and such their gratitude to their Saxon de∣liverers, that it is no wonder they should express it by the most extravagant caresses; nor that Vortigern should espouse Rowena the daughter of Hengist one of the Saxon leaders, and make her partner of his throne; nor that this prince, depending on Saxon prowess, should invite additional numbers, and allot them a territory adjoining to the isle of Thanet, the residence of the first settlers, per∣haps all that is now called Kent; though it has been said by some authors, that that district was granted to the first settlers, as the stipulated price of Rowena's beauty. Be this as it may, jealousies and suspicions breaking out in a little time between the Britons and their deliverers; and the latter preferring Britain to their own country, and seeing how easily they might make themselves masters of it, now under the government of a prince, whose vices and indolence rendered him unsit to govern at all, and having no other idea of a superior, than that of a leader elected for a particular purpose, considered the royal dignity of Vortigern as equally devoid of importance and utility: It is not to be wondered at, there∣fore, that Hengist, being possessed of his prince's ear, should, from the frequent inroads of the northern tribes, form a very convincing and persuasive argument for the necessity of a colony of his valiant countrymen to be placed in the north, to defend the country against them on their first attacks.</P>
<P>The plausibility of this argument, the imbecillity of Vortigern's political judg∣ment, the abjectness of spirit which prevailed in the British council, and the wretchedness of the people, groaning under the distresses of tyranny, together with the implicit confidence with which the prince listened to the admonitions of his specious friend, which flattered him with a safe and indolent reign; all con∣curred to facilitate the plan. Octa the brother of Hengist, and Ebussa his son on receiving the summons, prepared with alacrity to collect their adherents, and in a short time passed over with a chosen band and took possession of Northumber∣land in the year 454.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vortigern was by this time become a contemptible partizan of the Saxons, and so immersed in vice and debauchery, that St German, deputy of the Gallican church in Britain, reprimanded him severely for his adultery and dissolute course of life, which as he took no pains to reform, he was solemnly anathematized in a council of the British clergy, and his subjects absolved from their oath of allegiance.—<HI>Nennius. Camden. Hunt. &amp;c.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The new colony had not been settled in this district for any considerable time, before Hengist, no longer able as he pretended, to bear the indignities put upon him and his followers, and the infringements repeatedly made on the lands granted to them on their arrival, brought his troops into the field, and began hostilities. On his thus throwing off the mask, and appearing in arms at the head of his hardy Saxons, Vortigern's councils were full of confusion and asto∣nishment, and his subjects were seized with a panic bordering on despair. The resistance, therefore, they made, was weak and fruitless, and they fled before
<PB N="xxiv" REF="30"/>their conquerors, and betook themselves to hiding places in the most unculti∣vated tracts of the country.</P>
<P>In the mean time the colony in Northumberland, looking upon Hengist's proceedings in Kent, as a signal for them, (as in all probability it was meant) to take up arms in the north, took the field.</P>
<P>The struggles, during the course of fifty years and upwards, were many, and various the events; the Britons remaining unsubdued, and the Saxons unex∣pelled. At length in the year 547, Ida with his twelve sons, and a large rein∣forcement, landed at Flambrough, where they were received by their countrymen with acclamations of joy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Illud tamen non immerito notandum, quod cum Wodeno fuerint tres filii, Weldegius, Wintle∣gius, Beldegius; de primo, reges Cantauritarum; de secundo, Merciorum; de tertio, Weslsaxonum <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Northumbrorum; praeter duos quos precedens fermo nominare perget, originem traxerint.

<P>From the authority of the <HI>Scala Chronica,</HI> it appears, that after Hengist had settled in Kent, Octa and his successors assumed the title of dukes, until the Northumbrian Saxons following the example of those in Kent, elected a sovereign, who yet remained subject to the supreme authority of the Kentish king. They are named in the following order. <Q><HI>Hiring</HI> that begat <HI>Wodnam,</HI> that begat “<HI>Witeglass,</HI> of whom came <HI>Hort</HI> the King, that begat <HI>Uppa,</HI> that begat <HI>Heppa,</HI> that begat <HI>Hermeger,</HI> that begat <HI>Bernack;</HI> all which were before the noble ”King Ida; and the gestes of them before Ida be little known by croniques.</Q> But this account being ill supported, it is more than probable, that Ida was the first who assumed the name of King, over the Northumbrian colony. The success and safety of it being chiefly derived from him, this no doubt in∣fluenced them to dignify him with this title, and from the power of the henezogen, to advance him to that of King. What induced the Saxons to forsake their old constitutional mode, and give Ida this new authority, authors are silent. It is probable they brought themselves to adopt a British custom, with a view of conciliating the natives to their government.</P>
<P>At this period when the Saxons were in a good measure become masters, it may be necessary to give some account of the state of religion amongst the Britons.</P>
<P>Pelagianism still gaining ground, St German was, by earnest entreaties, prevailed on to return, and was accompanied by Severus, Bishop of Triers. According to the credulity of the times, miracles were performed, which together with the force of reasoning, put the sectaries out of countenance; and schools were instituted, in which young men of rank were taught the the sacred truths, uncontaminated with heresy. Dubricius who had the care of one of those Seminaries, was made Bishop of Llandaff, and afterwards of Caerleon. The foundation of twelve monasteries is attributed to him, whose members earned their bread by labour. He was held in such esteem,
<PB N="xxv" REF="31"/>that it is said he had the honor to invest Uther, and afterwards Arthur, with the ensigns of royalty: And in his time so many excellent seminaries flourished, and disciples of such great eminence in the Church had reccived their educa∣tion in them, that the fame of their civil and ecclesiastical learning prevailed over Europe. At this time Britain was divided into three Archbishopric's, York, London, and Caerleon: The kingdom of Northumberland was in the jurisdic∣tion of York, and the British Church received the first form of its liturgy from German and Lupus, who introduced the order of the Gallican Church.</P>
<P>An instance of the authority of a clerical council, so early as the reign of Vortigern, appears from his being censured, and an anathema pronounced against him, under which his subjects were absolved from their oath of allegi∣ance; a <HI>second</HI> in the consecration of St Dubricius; a <HI>third,</HI> for the recognition of the right of Arthur; a <HI>fourth,</HI> in the church of St David at Brevy, on the prevalence of Pelagianism; a <HI>fifth</HI> at Landaff, on the treaty of amity and peace be∣tween Mauritius and Cynetu, two sovereigns of petty principalities in Wales; <HI>another</HI> at Landaff on the fatal dissentions between Morcaunt and Frioc, two other petty Welsh princes.</P>
<P>The Christian religion, or rather the Church, is represented by Gildas, at this time as suffering a severer persecution by the Saxon Idolaters than it had suffer∣ed even under Dioclesian. But whether the barbarities complained of by this historian were merely on account of religion, or whether other causes, as is ge∣nerally the case, did not also contribute thereto, is hard to say.</P>
<P>From St Gregory's epistle to the Franks it appears, that the pious example of the civilized Britons greatly influenced the Saxon conversion; but, from the unhappy disposition of some of the chief Religious, the British Church refusing to give the necessary encouragement to this propitious temper of the Saxons, with-held instruction, and shut the doors against their communion. It is to be wished, that a veil could be drawn over the intolerating principles of such su∣percilious and self-righteous clergy, as thinking the Church in danger from Pe∣lagianism, and yet were totally indifferent about bringing over the ignorant and idolatrous Saxons to a knowlege of the truths of Christianity, even when they shewed a disposition to embrace them.</P>
<P>Gregory seeing their reprehensible conduct, with a degree of contempt, though not without pity, would not suffer the propitious hour to elapse, in which he judged the conversion of the Saxons depended, and therefore, in 182, sent over Augustine, a man of rigid virtue, and powerful oratory, to attempt the im∣portant work<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sea. Chron. lib. 2. Lol. Col. v. ii. p. 514.</NOTE></P>
<P>After this account of the state of Britain in general, which it is presumed will not be thought an unnecessary introduction to that of the kingdom of Northumberland in particular, as leading the reader to that part of it which is to be the subject of this narrative; it is first to be observed, that this kingdom extended from the Humber northward to Lothian, and comprehended the great∣est
<PB N="xxvi" REF="32"/>part of Yorkshire, Lancashire, Cumberland, Westmorland, Durham, and what is now called the county of Northumberland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leland's Itin. v. vi. p. 60.—Symeon Dunelm—Malmsbury, &amp;c.</NOTE>. But the kingdom of Ida, which was called Bernicia, as far as can be collected from the obscurity which involves this distant part of history, comprehended only a narrow portion of the territory which afterwards formed the kingdom of Northumberland.</P>
<P>Historians assert, that IDA having assumed the Sceptre, but what his title was, or whether got by election or usurpation, authors give no account, he fixed his residence at<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hen. Huntington.—Leland's Col. v. iii. p. 385. &amp;c.</NOTE> Berbbanburgh, where he erected a fortress and mansion. By ma∣ny writers he is said to be the original founder; but it is probable he found some antient works in this eligible situation, which induced him to fix his particu∣lar attention to it; and that he repaired and enlarged the outworks, removed a wooden palisadoe, with which the whole had been defended, and by a com∣pleat circumvallation of mason-work, rendered the fortress as strong as possible<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camden.</NOTE>. So far all authorities agree, that this was his chief place of residence. He held his Crown independent of that of Kent, or any other power. His reign was full of trouble and warfare; for, besides the fatigue incident to an infant State and unsettled form of government, the Britons were frequently issuing from their places of concealment, and harassing the frontiers of his kingdom; yet, with such military ardour did the Saxons defend, and with such judgment did Ida command, that, during a reign of twelve years, the enemy gained no con∣siderable advantage. He had issue by his Queen six sons, Adda, Ethelric, The∣odoric, Edric, Osmer, and Theofredum; and, by his Concubines, six; Alric, Ogga, Ecca, Osbald, Segora, and Segothae, all of whom had come into Bri∣tain along with him<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Symeon Dunelm.</NOTE>. On his demise he was succeeded by ADDA in 559, who reigned seven years; during which period, Aella, one of the Chief∣tains who had come over with Ida, and was said to have been his nephew, con∣ducted a body of forces against the province of<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i. p. 99</NOTE> Deira, and, having expelled the inhabitants, assumed sovereignty, and settled there with his retainers. Whether he marched these forces at the command or request of his Sovereign, or he persuaded them to share in his ambitious views, does not appear: Certain however it is, that he assumed a separate sovereignty. How far<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">That this was part of the kingdom of the <HI>Northumbrians,</HI> is asserted by the generality of our historians, who agree with Bede in the division of it into the two several kingdoms of <HI>Deiri</HI> and <HI>Bernicii:</HI> Dera rice and Beornica rice, or, as the Saxon Chronicle has it, Dearne rice, p. 29. 23. and 32. 7.; and Baernice, p. 30, 2.; and Beornice, 44.26. But they are not so well agreed as to the limits of the two lesser kingdoms. Richard Prior of Hexham, fixes the limits of <HI>Deira</HI> between the rivers <HI>Humber</HI> and <HI>Tees:</HI> but those of <HI>Bernicia,</HI> between the <HI>Tees</HI> and <HI>Twede.</HI> He affirms, that some of the Northumbrian Kings reigned only over the <HI>Deiri,</HI> as <HI>Aella;</HI> others over the <HI>Bernicii</HI> only, as <HI>Adda,</HI> the son of <HI>Aella:</HI> Some over both; as <HI>Edwine,</HI> son of same <HI>Aella,</HI> and <HI>St Oswald</HI> and <HI>Oswius,</HI> from whose times the king∣dom remained entirely under one. And this division Mr Somner seems to approve of in his Gloss. voce Deora maegþe, in complaifance to Camden in <HI>Ottadinis.</HI> But the learned Antiquary seems to have overlooked what he had before delivered in <HI>Brigantia,</HI> where he assigns to <HI>Deira</HI> all that lies between <HI>Tine</HI> and <HI>Humber;</HI> and to <HI>Bernicia,</HI> all from <HI>Tine</HI> to the <HI>Frith of Edenburgh.</HI> To this division I am rather in∣clined to agree, in reference to the etymology of the word, which our Antiquaries will have derived from deor, signifying wild beasts; and that this division of the kingdom took its names from the woods which gave them shelter. These woods, in all probability, extended from the <HI>Humber</HI> to the <HI>Derwent,</HI> which empties it self into the <HI>Tine,</HI> taking in Deorƿald; and Deorham in its way, which all of them bear some assinity with the name; the latter of which lies beyond the <HI>Tees,</HI> betwixt it and the <HI>Derwent:</HI> and there is a description of it agreeable enough to our conjecture given in that elegant Saxon peom, which was first printed in Symeon Dunelm.

Script. p. 76.; and again in the last page, at the end of the gles∣sary; but since much more correctly in Dr Hickes's learned and most complete Thesaurus, with a Latin translation, and notes, of the Lord Bishop of Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lisle. And now if I have given the <HI>Deiri</HI> too large an ex∣tent of dominion, the character of the learned and judicious editer of the Saxon Chronicle, who car∣ries it farther, will stand between me and censure. He agrees in the derivation of the word from Deor, <HI>Fera:</HI> but to the kingdom of <HI>Deira</HI> he allots all that lies between <HI>Humber</HI> and <HI>Twede,</HI> and includer, by name, <HI>Yorkshire, Lancashire, Westmoreland, Cumberland, Northumberland,</HI> and <HI>Bishopric of Durham.</HI> To the Beornicas he assigns all between <HI>Twele</HI> and the <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith of Edenburgh.</HI> But, after all, it will not be im∣possible to reconcile all these divisions, upon the foot of that account which the Prior of Hexham, afore cited, gives us of the different extent of dominion that different Kings were possessed of, according to their several rights or claims of succession, and the events of war.—<HI>Notes to E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stob's Saxon Homily, page</HI> 13.</NOTE> Deira ori∣ginally extended, is difficult to ascertain.</P>

<P>GLAPPA, a kinsman of Ida, succeeded to the Throne of Bernicia in 567; but, during the five years he reigned, no great event is recorded; only it may be observed, that, as several of Ida's sons were living at the time of his ascending the Throne, the Saxons paid no regard to hereditary right.</P>
<P>THEODWALD ascended the Throne in the year 572, and reigned but one year. Of his trans∣actions historians are silent. He was succeeded by FRETHULF, a second brother to Glappa, who assumed the Sceptre in the year 573, and reigned seven years. Of the transactions of the northern Saxons in this period, we have no information. On his demise, THEODORIC, the third son of Ida, ascended the Throne, and reigned seven years. Here we have a second example of the elective power being exercised, and one more striking than the former, as therein appears a preference of Theodoric to his el∣der brother Ethelric, then living. Of the transactions of this reign, historians are also silent.</P>
<PB N="xxviii" REF="34"/>
<P>AELLA, who had reigned in the province of Deira with great reputation for twenty-se∣ven years, on the death of Theodoric was elected to the Sovereignty of Berni∣cia. The two provinces thus united, obtained the name of the kingdom of Northumberland. As he maintained the Crown of Deira by his valour and prudent conduct, so the united provinces, by his wise government, enjoyed an uninterrupted peace. His reign over Northumberland commenced in the year 587, and continued only three years. He had issue Edwine, who some time af∣ter ascended the Throne of his father, and a daughter, Acca, who was Ethel∣frith's Queen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. Paris.</NOTE>. After the death of Aella, ETHELRIC, the second son of Ida, taking advantage of the childhood of Edwine, succeeded to the Sovereignty of the united provinces in the year 589. He had spent the greatest part of his life in retirement, and was far advanced in years. It is pro∣bable he enjoyed uninterrupted peace for five years, as we have no account of any particular transactions of his reign. He left issue two sons, Ethelfrith, who succeeded to the Crown, and Tedbald, who in his brother's reign was slain, as after mentioned.</P>
<P>ETHELFRITH, from his disposition named the fierce, or wild, succeeded his father in the year 593.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i. p. 135.; and v. ii. p. 512.</NOTE>. The better to conciliate Edwine, the son of Aella, to his possession of the united Crowns, he espoused his sifter Acca, and his reign commenced with great joy and magnificence<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Scala Chron. lib. 2.</NOTE>. He was engaged in a ten years war with the Britons, in which he enlarged his territories, and acquired great honour. His arms were esteemed irresistible, and many voluntarily submitted themselves to his government. It is said, that he extended his conquests farther, and reaped more laurels than any of his predecessors<NOTE PLACE="‖">Bede, lib. 1. Hen. Hunting. lib. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As his fame and dominions increased, his northern neighbours regarded him with a jealous eye; and thinking themselves in some danger, seized the first pre∣text for drawing their forces into the field, and being led by Aegthan, or Adan, their King, approached the frontiers, in order to invade his territories. Ethel∣frith, assembling his forces, opposed them at Daegstane, or D'Egleston<NOTE PLACE="§">Holinshed. Chron.—Hen. Hunt.—Bede.—We have no place so applicable to the name and descrip∣tion as <HI>Fgyleston,</HI> on the banks of the Tees; and the monuments there, noticed in the progress of this work, encourage the conjecture, coupled with the circumstance, that the invaders made their progress from the west.</NOTE>, where, after a bloody conslict, victory declared for the Saxons; and the Scots sustained
<PB N="xxix" REF="35"/>so great a loss, as rendered them incapable of renewing the war. The joy of victory was greatly diminished by the death of the King's brother, Tedbald, an heroic youth, who had a considerable command, and fell in the field.</P>
<P>The Scots remaining quiet for four years, Ethelfrith in 607, carried his arms against the Britons, who had begun to harass the borders of his dominions; and falling upon them near Caerleon, overthrew them with great slaughter. It is reported, that whilst the armies prepared to engage, the King observing, at some distance, an assembly of Religious putting up prayers, as he conceived, for the Britons, and esteeming them as essential enemies as those who bore arms, stained his hands with the infamous slaughter of 1200 naked and defenceless Monks of the Monastery of Bangor, fifty only of the whole assembly escaping by flight<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bede.—Sax. Chron.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>His conquests made him so much the terror of the neighbouring States, that he continued some time unmolested in his extended dominions. During this interval of peace, looking upon the growing virtues of Edwine, his Queen's bro∣ther, with a jealous eye, and observing his encreasing popularity with great anxie∣ty, he at length meditated his death, as the only means of securing to himself the province of Deira, to which Edwine had a natural claim. The young Prince discovering a change in his conduct, or having some intimation of his own danger, took refuge in the Court of Redwald, King of the East Angles.</P>
<P>Ethelfrith, disappointed in his project, burned with resentment against Red∣wald, and immediately sent messengers to demand the fugitive, as a traitor, and on refusal, to denounce war against him. Redwald, considering the strength of his enemy, would have delivered up the Prince; but the entreaties of his Queen, who represented, in the most forcible languge, the inviolable laws of hospitality, and the disgrace such an action would bring upon him, prevailed with him, not only to continue the protection he had granted, but also to levy an army, and instantly march against Northumberland, to chastise the haughty Monarch for his insolent menaces.</P>
<P>The measures were pursued with such expedition, that Redwald was on the frontiers before the embassadors were returned. Alarmed at his sudden dan∣ger, Ethelfrith raised such forces as he could for the time, and advanced to stop the progress of the enemy. The armies joined battle on the banks of the Idle, near Nottingham, where Ethelfrith was slain, and his forces routed. This vic∣tory, though fortunate for Edwine, as it opened his succession to the Throne, was unhappy to Redwald, who lost his son Regen here, in the engagement.</P>
<P>The sons of Ethelfrith hearing of this great overthrow, and the death of their father, were conveyed by their mother Acca into Scotland, in order to secure them from the wrath of Edwine, leaving him no competitor for the Crown.</P>
<P>Ethelfrith reigned twenty-four years, leaving issue by his Queen seven sons, Eanfred, Oswald, Oswine, Olsac, Oswid, Ossa, and Ossa, also two daughters,
<PB N="xxx" REF="36"/>Oswitha and Ebba, who were afterwards canonized: And also, by a concubine, a son named Osweo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Math. Westm. Speed.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It doth not appear that the Northumbrians had the light of the gospel before the reign of Edwine. The Saxons had brought along with them their own gods, and few of the old British rites, except the Bel-tein, were retained. The modes of worship introduced by the Romans were forgotten, and their temples and altars levelled in the dust; and, till the Saxon mythology prevailed, it is much to be doubted whether there was any settled religion within the limits of this miserable district. Whether the stupendous monument on Yevering-Bell<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See View of Northumberland, v. i. p. 246.</NOTE> was appropriated to Saxon or British worship, is not easily determined. Its vicinity to Yevering, once a royal mansion of the Saxon monarchs, prompts an idea, that it was a holy place of that people. EDWINE, supported by the arms of Redwald, entered the capital of Northumberland in 617, and assumed the diadem, having then attained the age of twenty-three years. He possessed a noble and intrepid spirit, and conducted his military ope∣rations with such skill and fortitude, that in a short time he not only relieved the frontiers of his kingdom from the ravages and incursions of the neighbour∣ing nations, but extended his dominions even as far as the Orcades and Meva∣nian islands, now called the Hebrides<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Bede's Eccl. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st. lib. 11. Malms. lib. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>His wife, Cwenburga, the daughter of Ceorl, King of Mercia, did not live to see him mount the Throne. About eight years after his accession, the emi∣nent virtues and uncommon beauty of Ethelburga, daughter of the King of Kent, reaching his car, he sent ambassadors to require her in marriage. She had embraced the Christian faith, but he retaining his national prejudices and religious tenets, it was necessary that conditions should be stipulated for the free exercise to her religion, and that she should have her ministers to officiate there∣in. These preliminaries being settled, she was sent into Northumberland, under the spiritual tuition of Paulinus, ordained Bishop by Justus on that occasion, and the marriage was celebrated in 625<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Wm. Malms. lib. 1. Leland's Col. v. i. p. 138.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>At this time Cwichelm, in conjunction with his father, Cynegils, governed the kingdom of Wessex; a Prince of a dark and jealous mind, who observing the growing power and exalted glory of Edwine with envy, and conceiving he might disturb the lesser kingdoms of the Heptarchy, of which Wessex was then one of the weakest, determined to take him off by secret assassination. For this purpose he employed one Eumer, of whom Historians have said no∣thing previous to this plot. Edwine's Court was then held on the banks of Derwent, where the assassin approached him in the character of ambassador, and delivering a feigned address, the specious purport of which engaged the King's attention, the villain drew a poisoned dagger from under his cloak, and at∣tempted
<PB N="xxxi" REF="37"/>to plunge it in Edwine's bosom. Lilla, the King's faithful servant, perceiving his danger, instantly rushed between them, and received the fatal stab, which was given with such violence, that the weapon passed through his body, and wounded the King. The desperate assassin, surrounded by the guards, was cut to pieces, but not before he had slain another of the attendants in his own defence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bede.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The wound was at first alarming, which gave an opportunity to Paulinus to exhort him to renounce the errors of his religion; and the pious example, and tender love of Ethelburga, contributed not a little to dispose his mind to the arguments for his conversion; and at length, by a solemn vow, he promised, <Q>“That if the Deity which the Christians worshipped, and whom they called the God of justice, would enable him to punish the violator of the laws of nature, nations, and kings, who unprovoked, had sent forth the murder∣er against him, he would from thenceforth confess his divinity, and worship ”no other Gods but him.</Q> As a pledge of his vow, he delivered into the hands of Paulinus his infant daughter Eansled to be baptised, who was brought into the world the evening of the same day in which the horrid attempt had been made upon his life<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. She was the first Christian baptised in Northumberland.—Lel. Col. v. i. p. 335.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As soon as health permitted, he arrayed his troops, and marched against the West-Saxons, whom he overthrew in the first battle, and put to the sword all those who had devised his death by Eumer the assassin. Historians do not men∣tion, whether he made any political advantages to his kingdom by this war, or sat down satisfied with the issue of his revenge.</P>
<P>In the following year, 627, during the festival of Easter, he embraced the Christian faith, and was baptised by Paulinus, and many of his subjects followed his example. He was greatly moved to his conversion, Bede faith, by a vision; which he relates to the following purport. Whilst Edwine remained under Redwald's protection, being apprised that an attempt was made to induce Red∣wald to deliver him up to his enemies, as he sat meditating in the night, at the door of his apartment, he was accosted by a stranger, who told him he knew the cause of his grief, gave him much consolation, and assured him Redwald's intention was diverted by the virtuous remonstrances of his Queen. He also predicted to him the prosperity of his future life, and gave him some wise and pious admonitions. Edwine promised the stranger, that, if the things he fore∣told came to pass, he would certainly follow his doctrines, and obey his pre∣cepts; on which the grave monitor desired him to bear in memory, the time, place, and conversation; and, laying his hand on his head, blessed him, and instantly disappeared. Edwine, for some time after his victorious expedition against the West Saxons, delayed to perform his vow; but being accustomed to employ some hours in solitude and meditation, was retired to his chamber, when Paulinus, esteeming it a propitious hour for his holy purpose, entered the
<PB N="xxxii" REF="38"/>royal apartment, and without apology, boldly approached the King, and laid his right hand upon his head, and blessed him, asking whether he remembered that sign and token? Edwine, as if roused by the hand of some supernatural Power, and trembling at once with religious horror and conviction of mind, prepared to kneel at the pious Bishop's feet; but he restraining him, thus ad∣dressed himself to his Sovereign: <Q>Behold Sir, by the benevolence of our “merciful and omnipotent God, you have escaped the wrath of your enemies; by his mighty hand, and irresistible will, you have ascended the Throne of this kingdom; remember therefore your solemn vow; forthwith let the same be accomplished; embrace his saving health; let your spirit live in his faith and holy laws, who hath brought about these mighty things upon the earth, and hath exalted you to majesty and honour: By his divine power, you shall not only be preserved from everlasting death, under the precepts I teach, but shall be made a partaker of his ineffable beatitude, and everlasting glory in ”the regions of heaven.</Q></P>
<P>In the succeeding chapter, he goes on to relate Edwine's calling together the States, his sages and counsellors, to deliberate on the changes of religion, and to examine into the principles of the new doctrine. On this occasion Coyfi, the High-Priest of the Heathen Temple, boldly impeached the impotence of the Divinities they served, and one of the chief nobles professed, that in the prin∣ciples of their religion, there was no hope of futurity. After piously attending to the arguments of Paulinus, supported by the proofs of a divine revelation, he publicly renounced the errors of the Saxon religion, and, in his zeal for Christianity, proposed to have their temples and altars destroyed. Edwine, dis∣turbed with a superstition, founded on the prejudices of early education, stood confounded at the proposition, and demanded which among them had the im∣pious courage to dare the wrath of divinities they so long had worshipped, to try their strength, or prove their impotence? The Priest being armed, and mounted on a horse, advanced towards the temple. The multitude, struck with horror at his temerity, waited the event with trembling. He entered their holy place, and throwing his spear against the altars, defied the whole assembly. The universal silence was awful; but the impotent gods avenged not. The Priest then putting up a thanksgiving aloud, to that Omnipotent whom he had so lately learned to address, commanded his attendants to break down the idols and their altars, and set fire to the temple<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is to be observed, that proper covered temples appear not to have been erected for the service of those Pagan Idols which the Saxons here worshipped: Polluit et destruxit eas, quas ipse sacraverat, aedes, says the Latin Bede.</NOTE>. This public spectacle opened the eyes of the vulgar; and as there was no priest-craft to amuse, or art to delude, the whole was laid in ashes, without any great shock to them; for if prejudices in favour of Saxon idolatry were not hereby quite rooted out, they would at least be considerably abated.</P>
<P>Bede says, the scite of this temple, in his days, was to be seen not far from Eboracum, at the head of the Derwent, then called Gotmundingaham. But
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="39"/>the old Historian has been misinformed, for it is well known to have been at Godmanham, near Market-Weighton, (the antient Delgovitia)<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The place where the Pagan temple stood, at Godmundingham, seems to be an exact semicircle, (whose diameter is 260 yards, being distinguished into a great many parts or portions, whereof some seem to be more peculiarly designed for the worship of the idols, the rest to be offices or appendices for the reception of such persons as came there to worship; and others again appear probably to have been the place where the victims themselves were slain and offered, and where all their necessary utensils were deposited. Sub∣servient to this latter purpose, is a place in length 350 yards, in breadth twelve or fourteen, and about eight yards deep, except on the east, where, from this bottom, there rises a hill at least eight or nine fathoms perpendicular, whence one easily surveys the whole area, and which seems to have been more particularly set apart for the worship of the chief idol: for this hill (as it was said) was artificial, and probably made of the rubbish which was dug out from below. This hollow and deep place seems also to have been portioned into two squares, a small space being only left between them. Besides this hill, there seem to be but two other places more immediately set apart for worship, each whereof may be about 60 yards or upwards one way, and about twelve or fourteen the other. But what I call offices are very numerous over the whole plot, though of very different sizes and forms. As to the form, they tend mostly to a round or oval, and some few square, but the size is vastly different, some being only six, seven, or eight yards in circumfe∣rence; others, again, twelve, fifteen, or twenty. I was informed, that good quantities of stone had been dug out in many places; and another place was shewn me, where several rows of ashlers had been found, a course of sandy metal lying between every row. This heretofore famed place goes now by the name of <HI>the Howes;</HI> and close adjoining thereto, on the south, is a pretty large piece of ground, of ten or twelve acres, now a corn field, called Chapel Gathends. The foundations of a wall are to be seen on the north∣side, where it unites the two extremities of the semicircles; but all the semicircular part seems to have been secured by a mount of earth.—<HI>Gibson's Edit.

<P>Such was the excellence of Edwine's government, that acts of injustice were seldom heard of among his subjects; foreign enemies forbore to provoke his arms, and an uninterrupted peace blessed his people for several years. Internal police was then his chief object; the roads were made safe and commodious, and the accommodation of the public was so minutely attended to, that every spring by the way side was provided with a dish for the refreshment of travel∣lers. He frequently perambulated the provinces of his kingdom, putting salu∣tary laws in execution; so that no injured person was long without redress<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bede.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>At this time Penda, King of the Mercians<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The kingdom of Mercia comprehended Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Cheshire, Staffordshire, Wor∣cestershire, Oxfordshire, Shropshire, Warwickshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Buckinghamshire, Nor∣thamptonshire, Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire, Bedfordshire, Rutlandshire, Huntingdonshire, and part of Hertfordshire.</NOTE>, ambitious to extend his domi∣nions, entered into a league with Cedwell, or as Camden calls him, Caswallan, King of Cumberland, a tributary prince, who ruled over one of the districts subdued by Edwine, and, under promise of joining him with all his forces, in∣duced the Cumbrian to take up arms. The restless people were easily provoked to an insurrection, and with a mad enthusiasm to cry out for liberty, though withdrawing their allegiance from Edwine could only tend to expose them to a subjugation more wretched, and a vassalage more severe. Cedwell calling upon all those whom the name of freedom could animate or delude, took the field, and began with cruelty and devastation to mark his progress in the frontier dis∣tricts. Edwine prepared to oppose him, whilst Penda, in consequence of his compact, joined his forces with the Britons, and at a place called Hethfield, waited the approach of the Northumbrians to give them battle. The conflict was dreadful. Edwine, and his eldest son Osfrid, with many men of note,
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="40"/>were slain. The fall of their commanders striking the troops with a panic, they took to flight, and the pursuit was prosecuted with such determined cruelty, that Egfrid, another of Edwine's sons, having been taken prisoner, was but∣chered in cold blood, to gratify the insatiable revenge of the savage Britons.</P>
<P>Ethelburga, her son Ulkfren, with Paulinus, under the care of Bassus, a faithful chieftain, fled by sea to the kingdom of Kent, then governed by Ead∣bald, the Queen's brother. She founded a monastery at Liming, on the happy shore where she found refuge, and there spent the remainder of her life in acts of piety, and was buried<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i. so. 10.—Scala Chron. lib. 2.</NOTE>. Paulinus was made Bishop of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, (Rochester) in which See he ended his days.</P>
<P>Edwine was slain in the month of October 633, in the forty-eighth year of his age, having reigned sixteen years, and was buried in St Peter's church at Strenshall, afterwards called Whitby. By Cwenburga, his first wife, he had issue two sons, Osfrid and Egfrid, who both fell in the fatal battle of Hethfield. By Ethelburga he had two sons, and two daughters; Ethelm, the eldest, died soon after his baptism, and was buried at Eboracum. Ulkfren was sent by his mother to the Court of France, where he died. Enfleda, the first born, whose nativity was singularly marked by the day of Edwine's death, became the queen of Oswy King of Northumberland. Ethelrida, the youngest daughter, died in her infancy, and was buried with her brother Ethelm.</P>
<P>The conquerors entered Northumberland with fire and sword, where they committed the most in human ravages. Wearied at length with desolating the country, they retired loaden with spoils, which afforded an opportunity to Ean∣frid, the eldest son of Ethelfrith, and Osric, son of Elfric, and uncle of Edwine, to leave their retreat in Scotland, and appear again in Northumberland.</P>
<P>EANFRID assumed the reigns of government in the year 633, in the province of Bernicia, and OSRIC in the province of Deira: And thus the kingdom of Northumberland became divided, as before, by each rightful heir seizing his own province<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. iv. p. 113.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Whilst Eanfrid and Osric resided among the Scots, they became Christians; but no sooner were they settled in their respective dominions, than, renouncing their new religion, they persecuted the Christians, and consecrated altars to the old idols of the Saxons<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Scala Cl ronica.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Cedwell, not able to hold the great territories he had thus subdued, or rather ravaged, and entertaining an inviolable hatred to the Saxon name, levied a great army, and again entered the province of Deira. Some authors cover his
<PB N="xxxv" REF="41"/>actions with the delusive countenance of religious zeal, and insinuate, that his wrath against those Princes was kindled by their apostacy; but the actions them∣selves prove the principles by which he was actuated.</P>
<P>Osric, not able to oppose the torrent, was slain; his city was sacked, and subjects were plundered<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We are greatly at a loss to know where the royal city of Deira was.</NOTE>. The victorious tyrant over-ran Deira, not like a generous warrior, who, amidst his conquests, remembers mercy, but like a ruthless savage, whose sole delight was blood and carnage. Such is the charac∣ter drawn by a modern writer of this British hero.</P>
<P>Eanfred, terrified at the horrid massacre in the adjoining province, and un∣able, in the feeble state of his own, to raise forces sufficient to stop the pro∣gress of the invaders, who came upon him like a whirlwind, determined to ap∣proach Cedwell with submission, and, taking only twelve soldiers with him, he entered the British camp unarmed, and bent himself at the tyrant's feet. Un∣moved with the humiliation of a King, uninfluenced by justice, or clemency, and against the common faith of nations, even among savages, Cedwell satiated himself in the blood of him who kneeled for his protection<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bede says, the Britons had no opinion of the Christianity of the Saxons, and refused to commune with them in the offices of religion any more than with professed Heathens; so that though Cedwell was a Chris∣tian, he had no mercy to the Saxons, and spared neither age nor sex.</NOTE>. And his pro∣gress afterwards was marked with every barbarity his inflamed vengeance could dictate. The whole country smoked in ashes, and the inhabitants, who escaped his sword, would have continued to fly before him, till the whole district was depopulated, had not OSWALD, the son of Ethelfrith, and brother of Eanfrid, left his retirement to head the distracted Northumbrians. The attempt was arduous, and few could be brought to enlist under a banner displayed by the hands of despair; for so powerful was the British tyrant, and so tremendous his cruelties, that it was esteemed an act of temerity to take up arms against him.</P>
<P>Oswald possessed much knowledge of the art of war, which he had studied as a science; but the Northumbrians were so dispirited, he could only gather toge∣ther a small body of faithful adherents, and with these, in a fortified camp, he prepared to oppose the invader. Cedwell, slushed with success, and proud of victory, approached Oswald with contempt. The latter, astonished at the num∣ber of his enemies, and comparing them with the little band on whose prowess he hitherto placed his hope, was now conscious, that he must not depend on man alone, without addressing himself to a superior Power for aid, and turning in his mind the justice of his cause, he cast up his eyes towards Heaven, and re∣nouncing the worship of gods who had not exerted themselves in defence of his Northumbrians, erected a cross<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">This he set up as his standard in the field wherein he encamped, sustaining the same with his own hands, until the soldiers with earth filled up the ground it was fixed in; and, from the victory ensuing, the cross was long after much frequented for the miracles said to be wrought by it.—<HI>Sammes Britannia.</HI></NOTE> in the front of his army, and reverently bend∣ing
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="42"/>to the earth, called upon the name of Christ, beseeching his mediation with the Father of all, in whose hand alone is the event of battle, that he would esta∣blish justice on the face of the earth. As if inspired, he arose, and called aloud to his soldiers (as Bede writes) <Q>Let us kneel down, and beseech the Almighty, “the living and true God, of his mercy to defend us, against this proud and ”cruel enemy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bede says, "No sign do we find, of the Christian faith, no church, no altar, through the whole king∣dom of Northumberland, to have been erected, before this noble leader and conductor of an army, direct∣ed thereto by faithful devotion, did raise the ensign of the Cross, when he was preparing to fight a savage and bloody enemy. When Oswald perceived in his battle the divine aid, which he had so earnestly implo∣red, he became a professed Christian. The place of victory was called Heavenfield<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Heavenfield, or Evenfield, where the water may be turned either way; as several old boundaries are called Even∣water-deal.

Cedwell advanced, arrogantly confident in his numbers, and insolent from his victories, assuring himself of vengeance on his opposer. And to inspire his people with still greater fortitude, he led on the attack in person, marched to the intrenchments, and mounted the rampart, when a fatal shaft pierced his bosom, and laid him in the dust. His followers, dismayed at his fall, halted, and being perplexed by inconsistent commands, fell into confusion, and began to retire. Oswald took immediate advantage of the event, and rushing upon them with a furious onset, put them to flight, when a dreadful carnage ensued, and the number of the slain was so great, that it seemed more than this little band could effect, to obtain so complete a victory, without the interposition of Heaven<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In Camden we have the following distich:

<P>On this happy event, the Northumbrians with acclamations raised Oswald to the Throne in the year 634. He conciliated the jealousy which had subsisted between the two provinces of Deira and Bernicia, and made them equally happy under his wise government; employing himself in reforming the manners of his subjects, and labouring their conversion to Christianity. The glory of his arms was not more eminent than the fame of his wisdom; his lenity and benevolence were even proverbial; the neighbouring nations regarded him with reverence, and his people obeyed him with love.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY AND ANTIQUITIES OF THE COUNTY PALATINE OF DURHAM.</HEAD>
<P>OSWALD having openly professed the Christian religion, was anxious to bring his subjects to follow his example. For this purpose he sent messen∣gers to Donald the Fourth, King of Scotland, under whose auspices he had lived during his retirement, requesting some holy missionaries might take the charge of their conversion. The first person sent on this pious office, Bede says, was of an austere disposition, and his name, as given by Hector Boethius, was Corman.</P>
<P>After preaching a short time, and meeting with little reverence, he returned home disgusted. When called upon by the Synod to give an account of his mis∣sion, he attributed his ill-success to the sluggish capacities of the English, their fierce and impatient nature, together with obstinate prejudices, which could not be reclaimed. This report not being satisfactory, Aidan, a pious presbyter, brought up in the monastery of Hii<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wharton's Ang. Sacra—Selden's Preface to the Decem Scriptores.</NOTE>, is said to have spoken freely against Corman, concei∣ving he had treated the people with too great severity, contrary to the Apostle's instruction, not having first dispensed the milk of a mild and placid doctrine, un∣til they had gained a due sense of the salutary joys of the word of God, enabling them to advance more mysterious and sublime principles, the duties of greater self∣denial, and a full knowledge of the divine ordinances. He proposed that a per∣son of milder disposition should be sent, who, with lenient speech and gentle man∣ners, might insinuate himself into their affections. The whole assembly approved
<PB N="2" REF="44"/>what Aidan advanced, and unanimously determined that he was worthy of the appointment, and should accordingly be dispatched to this unconverted nation; for, as Bede says<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 3. c. 5.—Hollinshed—Spotswood.</NOTE>, he was proved to possess that jewel, discretion, the handmaid of all virtues. It may be thought strange, perhaps, that Oswald should send into Scotland for a missionary to instruct his subjects in the Christian religion, and that he did not rather recall Paulinus, who had been driven from the See of York. But it must be considered, that Oswald had been instructed in religion by the Scotch, and had imbibed an aversion for the missionaries sent from Rome, on ac∣count of the diversity of sentiments between the Scotch and Romanists, in rela∣tion to the celebration of Easter, and the tonsure of priests.</P>
<P>Oswald received this second missionary with great veneration. Authors disagree about the seminary from whence he came, some alledging Melros, others Hii, and Ridpath, I'colm-kill: But it seems well settled, that he was a brother of the house of Hii or Jona, one of the islands called Hebrides; and it is generally allowed that he came to Oswald's court in the year 634<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i. p. 411.—Symeon Dunelm, p. 16.</NOTE>, where, by his moderation and per∣suasive eloquence, his temperance and moral life, he converted the nobles and chiefs of this powerful people, and laid the foundation of the See of Lindisfarne.</P>
<P>Aidan, having reaped such happy fruits of his labours, had the whole dominions of Oswald before him, wherein to chuse a place of residence. He requested the island of Lindisfarne, which afterwards obtained the name of Holy-Island<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">By Aidan's fixing the Episcopal See in Holy-Island, we may conclude he had no great regard for Pope Gregory's regulation; for this Pope, in his directions to Augustine the Monk, ordered the principal See for the northern parts to be settled at York. 'Tis plain, therefore, Aidan did not think himself under the Pope's Jurisdiction. Had this been the practice or belief of the Scottish Christians, Aidan would never have alter∣ed the seat of ecelesiastical jurisdiction, and removed it from York to Holy-Island.—<HI>Collies's Eccl.

<P>Multitudes were baptised; and from the fame of Aidan's success, many of his brethren left Scotland to assist in the holy work. They travelled into the wildest district, amongst the most uncultivated inhabitants, and the Christian religion in a very short time prevailed throughout all Oswald's dominions.</P>
<P>The situation of Lindisfarne was perhaps chosen by Aidan as similar in some de∣gree to the place of his former residence; but it seems more probable, it was
<PB N="3" REF="45"/>esteemed a secure retreat, and least liable to be disturbed by the ferocious states who yet remained unconverted, and were perpetually stirring up feuds against the Christians: And as Bebbanburgh was the place of royal residence, and chief for∣tress of the Northumbrian kingdom, he could not have chosen a more proper situ∣ation: For Lindisfarne was under its immediate protection; and besides being on the north, and secured by the point of land where Berwick now stands, and where there is reason to believe a fortress had been erected in a very early age, it was se∣vered twice a-day from the main land by the influx of the tide. It was also ren∣dered solemn by the awful prospect of the ocean, and was calculated for medita∣tion and retirement, being thus periodically shut out from the intercourse of the continental inhabitants: There was ground enough for exercise, and the growth of vegetables, and it had a daily supply of fish from the bounteous hand of Pro∣vidence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By Bede it is described, "Qui locus accedente ac recedente reumate bis quotidie instar insulae maris circumluitur undis, bis renudato littore contignus terrae redditur.

<P>After a regular Church was established, the audiences became numerous; so that it was found necessary, for the more general benefit of the people, to form places of worship in different districts. In the beginning of Aidan's time, it seems the public offices were performed in the open air; but the inconveniences that must have followed, would induce them to build some places of shelter for reli∣gious assemblies: But when this was done, is not related by any of the ancient writers. Bede's account, is; <Q>That the virtuous Bishop Aidan remained in a vil∣lage “belonging to the King, not far from the city of Bebba; for having there a church and a chamber, he used frequently to tarry in that place, taking from ”thence journies into the country to preach the gospel.</Q> It may be either im∣plied from hence, that he had a congregation, or a sacred erection: But the fol∣lowing seems expressly to clear this up; for he says, <Q>Being sick, they erected “him a lodge, fastening it firmly to the church-wall, on the west side, where rest∣ing against a post, which adjoined to the out-side of the church to strengthen it, ”he died.</Q> His body was carried from thence to Holy-Island, and buried in the cemetery of the Monastery<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aidanus peregit in Episcop. annos 17.

<P>Aidan's character was excellent, all authors agreeing that he lived what he preached; and Bede, in particular, writes of him as follows: <Q>Aidan was con∣secrated “Bishop when Segenius was Abbot of the monastery of Hii; in which, among other rules for the conduct of life, he left the religious an excellent ex∣ample of continence and self-denial. His doctrines were recommended to the world by his conduct, which strictly corresponded with his precepts. He desired not the things of the earth, nor was he enamoured of the vanities of life: He had sincere pleasure in distributing in alms what the wealthy gave; for he laid not up treasures elsewhere than in Heaven. He went about teaching the gospel daily, as well in the adjacent country as in the city; and never but on urgent occasions rode on horseback, preferring the more humble progress on foot. Whomsoever he met, rich or poor, he taught the gospel, by every argument his rhetoric and zeal suggested, working the conversion of some, and strengthening the faith of others, exhorting all, as well by precept as example, to works of charity, piety, and virtue. His religious life so far surpassed the negligence and lukewarm devotion of our times, that all those who accompanied him were the professed or lay brethren, who gave up their whole time to contemplation: Reading and expounding the scripture, or rehearsing the psalter, was the daily exercise of him and his brethren, to what place soever they came. Whenever he was invited to the King's banquet, he took with him two or three clerks, and making a short repast, quickly retired, either to read with his brethren, or go to prayer. From his example of abstinence, the religious of both sexes accus∣tomed themselves to fast on Wednesdays and Fridays until the hour of three in the afternoon. Whenever the nobles transgressed the rules of the gospel, neither the fear of displeasure, or hope of reward, checked the severity of his reproof. He made no presents to those who visited him, however exalted their rank, but offered them merely necessary refreshment. He applied the rich gifts which he received to pious uses, relieving the poor, or ransoming those who had been wrongfully sold, and were in wretched captivity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here have evidence of slaves being held by the inhabitants of this land, as early at least as the days of Bede, and from these were the villains of after ages.</NOTE>, several of whom, after redemption, he took for pupils, bringing them up in the school of virtue and ”pious erudition, and thence exalting them to the high dignity of priesthood<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Spottiswood—Hollinshed—Collier, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</Q></P>

<P>The fate of Cedwell was no example to Penda, the Mercian King, whose envy against Oswald urged him to rise in arms against him. He levied an army, and marched against Northumberland. Oswald arrayed his troops, and met him at Maserfield in Shropshire, on the 5th day of August 642, where, after a long and bloody conflict, victory declared for the Mercians, and Oswald was slain. The inhuman victor caused the royal remains, after being horribly mangled, to be sus∣pended

<P>Much doubt remains where he was interred, some asserting that his head was deposited at Lindisfarne, and right hand and arm were placed in a silver shrine in the church of Bebbanburgh, from whence they were translated to Lindisfarne, and finally rested with St Cuthbert at Durham. Bede says<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. iii. c. 11.</NOTE> That his bones, at the command of Osfrida, Penda's queen, and Oswine's daughter, were carefully removed from the field of battle, and interred in the monastery of Bradney in Lincolnshire, from whence they were afterwards carried to Gloucester, and laid on the north side of the choir of the cathedral there. And he adds, <Q>That it “was reported he ended his life in prayer; that, being encompassed by the ene∣my, and exposed to the weapons of the multitude, instant death impending, his last breath expired in a petition to God for the souls of those soldiers who bled in the field. Oswine, his successor, a year after, came with an army, and took away his remains, burying the head in Holy-Island, and the right hand ”and arm in the city of Bebba.</Q> Bede has mentioned several miracles wrought at his tomb, for which the reader, if he pleases, may apply to the holy monk's own account; instead of which, in this place, he will perhaps be better pleased with the following character, in the words of the same historian<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. iii. c. 6.</NOTE> <Q>Notwith∣standing “his majesty and power, he was meek to all, gracious to the poor, and to pilgrims and strangers bountiful.

He commanded the dish to be removed, the victuals it contained to be distributed, and afterwards the dish itself to be broken in pieces, and given amongst them; at sight of which, the bishop, who sat by the king, in a religious rhapsody, took him by the right hand, and cried aloud, 'I pray God this hand may never be consumed!' which thing came to pass; for after he was slain in battle, his hands and arms were severed from the body, and now to this time continue uncorrupted, laid up in a silver shrine in St Pe∣ter's church, where, with due honour, they are worshipped of all men in the ”king's city, whose name is derived of Bebba, once queen<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Symeon Dunelm. p. 21.—Lel.

<P>Oswald having reigned nine years, fell in the 38th year of his age. By his wife Kineburg, the daughter of Cynegils, first Christian king of the West Saxons, whom he married in the third year of his reign, he had Ethelwald, his only child. OSWY, the son of Ethelfrith, the fierce, or wild, by a concubine, mounted the throne of Bernicia in the year 642; whilst Oswine, son of Osric, the last king of Deira, seized the sceptre of that province.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="48"/>
<P>OSWINE, of a mild disposition, governed his subjects with lenity; and, contenting himself with his own dominions, sought only to preserve peace to his subjects. Oswy, of a turbulent and ambitious temper, eager for extent of dominion, and impatient of a rival in the empire, sought frequent occasions to disturb Oswine, and at length an open rupture took place.</P>
<P>It appears from several ancient writers, that Aidan was much interested in Os∣wine's affairs; in one part he is called the king's familiar. The division of the kingdom being the cause of dissention between the sovereigns, he laboured much to reconcile them; and from the grief sustained on Oswine's death, he survived him but twelve days. Though authors are silent as to the fact, yet the circum∣stances imply, that Aidan had been busy in secular affairs, and influenced Os∣wine's accession to the crown of Deira. Oswy was brother to Aidan's great pa∣tron, the founder of the church of Lindisfarne, as king of Bernicia, where the episcopal see was established. Notwithstanding this, the pious bishop was an ad∣herent to Oswine; but whence the attachment arose, more than from Oswine's piety, is not said, Oswy not being accused of irreligion. Broken-hearted, how∣ever, as it seems, for having led Oswine into schemes of fatal ambition, he died of grief on the last day of August, in the 17th year of his episcopacy.</P>
<P>Both kings took the field: Oswy's passion for arms had induced him to train and discipline his troops, even in times of profound peace; whilst Oswine studied to cultivate the arts which enrich a people, and neglected those necessary to make him respectable in the field. Oswy's army was more numerous and better ar∣rayed than that of Oswine; to whom this being made known, willing to spare the effusion of blood, he declined coming to an engagement; and when his friends urged him to try the event of battle, he secretly withdrew, and concealed himself in the house of Humwald, in hopes he might abide in safety, and elude the search of his enemy. Humwald had been raised in his dignities by the bounty of Oswine; Gillingham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gillingham, or Guethlin, where this tragical event happened, is presumed to be the hamlet or town of Gilling in Yorkshire, within two miles of Richmond. It is thus supported: Ancient authors, speaking of William the Conqueror's gift of Richmondshire to Alan, say, Alan built a strong sort near to his town of Gillingham. And Bede says, Wilfares-downe, where the armies met, was distant from Cataracton about ten miles to the west—Lib. iii. c. 14.</NOTE>, the place of his retreat, had been the gift of that sove∣reign; and therefore, from principles of gratitude, he was bound to protect him.</P>
<P>The army of Deira, forsaken by their prince, disbanded themselves, and fled, leaving the country open, to be possessed by Oswy. In hope of reward, the earl betrayed his trust, and delivered up the fugitive, who was immediately put to death. This tragical event happened on the third day of September, A. D. 651, in the ninth year of Oswine's reign.</P>
<P>Bede, speaking of Oswine, says, <Q>He was a marvellous, devout, and godly man; “was of a beautiful and open countenance, of superior stature, gentle and courteous in his language; of a civil and amiable deportment; to the great, honourable;
<PB N="7" REF="49"/>and liberal to the lower ranks of men. By his happy countenance, enlarged heart, and most princely demeanor, he was beloved of all. His fame was so great in other courts, that the nobility of various realms were in his suite, am∣bitiously striving to be distinguished by him. Amidst his virtues, his humility, ”and religious lowliness, were excellent.</Q></P>
<P>As to the disputes about the celebration of Easter, in the time of this prelate, and of his patron, Oswald, it is observed by Collier, <Q>That Bede, though an ad∣herent “to the Roman ritual, did not think the pope a necessary center of com∣munion, or that the rest of Christendom were indispensibly obliged to be sub∣ject to his authority. Had this been his opinion, he would never have raised ”Oswald and Aidan to so great a distinction of saintship.</Q> But Collier's par∣tiality is obvious; for he could not have overlooked what Bede really says; <Q>“Thus much I have written of this holy man and his works, not approving his wrong observation of Easter, according to the Jewish computation, but detest∣ing that in him utterly, as I have expressly declared in my book, De Temporibus. But, as it behoveth a true historiographer, I have related such things of him, and his works, as may profit the reader. That he was a man of great cha∣rity, and of a placid spirit; of strict continency and humility; superior to wrath and covetousness, and a detester of pride and vain glory. I also praise his great industry, both in observing and teaching the laws of God; his dili∣gence in study, his faithful watchings, his holy dignity in rebuking the haughty and proud, and mild demeanor in comforting the lowly and weak of heart; together with his unbounded liberality in relieving the poor. In short, I com∣mend him, as one that laboured all his days (for such he was reported to me by one who knew him intimately), to accomplish all that is written in the holy scriptures, the precepts of Prophets and Apostles. These things, in that holy prelate, I do love and praise, as undoubtedly being acceptable to Almighty God. But that he observed not Easter in its due season, either through ignorance, or under the prejudices of his country, if he knew better, this I neither commend or allow. Yet in this very point I admit, that, in his manner of observing Easter, he believed, reverenced, and taught no other doctrine than we do, the redemption of mankind by the passion, resurrection, and ascension of Christ ”Jesus, the mediator between God and Man.</Q></P>
<P>It would be treating the reader with no respectful deference to repeat Bede's ac∣count of two miracles attributed to Aidan; the first, on Penda's attempt to set fire to Bebbanburgh, of the wind changing on the prayer of Aidan; the latter, on calming a storm, by pouring some sanctified oil into the sea, by his advice, on foreseeing a storm might happen. Of the former a shrewd guess might be made by a resident on Lindisfarne, on observing the almost regular breeze, with the in∣flux of the tide, the time when Aidan is said to have offered up his prayer. Of the latter, it is not unfair to infer, that the good man had read Pliny.</P>
<P>It is said Cuthbert, a shepherd near Melros, had a holy vision, and beheld the spirit of Aidan ascending to Heaven; which made such an impression on his mind, that he determined to lead a religious life, and soon after gained admittance into that monastery.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="50"/>
<P>During Aidan's time, Lindisfarne was the supreme see in the north, York be∣ing vacant.</P>
<P>When Oswy had removed the obstacle to an union of the provinces, he took possession of Deira; but his government was not established more than two years, when Ethelwald, the son of Oswald, appeared, having attained the age of sixteen years, and heading the malcontents in Deira, declared himself a competitor for that crown. The province was glad to embrace an opportunity of shaking off the yoke of Oswy, whom they looked upon with detestation, on account of the inno∣cent blood of Oswine, whose memory they revered. Oswy, with repeated efforts, was not able to dispossess him, every struggle terminating in Ethelwald's favour.</P>
<P>Whilst these revolutions happened in the state, on Aidan's death a successor to the see of Lindisfarne was brought from the same Scottish monastery; and it is observable, that all the monasteries in Scotland were subject to Jona, as being the first foundation; which unravels the confusion of ancient authors as to the school in which the first bishops of Lindisfarne were educated.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Symeon Dunelm. p. 27.</NOTE> FINAN, who succeeded to the see, soon after his arrival began to build a church, accord∣ing to Bede, suitable for a bishop's residence, and formed, after the Scottish mo∣del, of timber, and thatched with reeds. Theodore, archbishop of Canterbury, some time afterwards, dedicated it to St Peter<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 367.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It appears that he was warm in the dispute which for some time agitated the Church, touching the observation of Easter, and remained inflexible to the argu∣ments of Ronan, a Scotsman, who had received his education in Italy, and was sent to divert his opinion.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. iii. c. 25.</NOTE> Bede says, he was a hasty tempered man, and, by such disputation, was exasperated, and made a professed adversary to the Roman usage.</P>
<P>That controversy, he adds, brought many to the true faith, but inflamed others to a farther search and examination of the question. They increased after Colman succeeded to this bishopric, and other disputes arising touching external practices and ceremonies, many began to fear and doubt, least, bearing the name of Chris∣tians, they, in the Apostles words, <HI>had run in vain.</HI> The tribulation even reached the palaces of princes.</P>
<P>Oswy had scarce reconciled himself to the loss of Deira, before Penda, renewing hostilities in Bernicia, reduced him in a short time to extremities. Offers of peace were rejected, and the noble gifts, even the regal insignia, jewels, and ornaments of the throne, were refused with scorn: Nothing but extent of empire could sa∣tisfy the Mercian. Add to this, that Ethelwald then brought his forces into the field, and declared himself Penda's ally.</P>
<P>Under these complicated calamities, Oswy determined to try the event of battle, as it was evident nothing but ruin would be the consequence of submission. He
<PB N="9" REF="51"/>collected a few veterans in whom he could place confidence, and, together with his son Alcfrid, led them forth, trusting for success in the justice of his cause. Ethelwald, before the onset, considering, that the success of either party would finally terminate in his ruin, when the Mercians charged, withdrew his forces to observe the event, that he might be the better enabled to deal with the victor. This at once gave courage to the Bernicians, and at the same time struck the Mer∣cians with a panic; for, fearing they were betrayed, they betook themselves to flight. December was far advanced when this engagement happened, and the place where it was fought was near to Loidis, which Camden conjectures is now Leeds, on the banks of the river then called Winwed. Penda, and his ally Ethelric, king of the East-Angles, tried every effort to rally the disconcerted army, which greatly exceeded that of the Bernicians, and, as some authors alledge, were thirty to one; but, in the confusion, both leaders falling, their vast army was put to the rout; and what greatly encreased the slaughter, was the sudden inundation of the river, which, overflowing the plain where Penda had drawn up his forces, add∣ed to the embarrassment of the flying troops; so that a great number perished in the water.</P>
<P>Bede's account is, that, before the battle, Oswy made a solemn vow to God, that, if he prevailed, he would dedicate his daughter to the service of Heaven, in perpetual virginity, and grant twelve farm-holds, with the appurtenant lands, for the erection and endowment of religious houses<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Charlton, in his history of Whitby, remarks a mistake that most of our historians have fallen into, who assert, that Ethelwald returned at the head of his troops into his own dominions, where he reigned peaceably several years after; which is an account that abounds with contradictions: For, in the first place, it does not appear that Ethelwald had ever been out of his own dominions, since Leeds, where the scene of the late action had been, lay almost in the centre of Deira, or at least very far distant from any of its borders. And, next, all authors affirm that Oswy, soon after this engagement, wherein he had slain Penda, made a conquest of Mercia, to which he could have no access but through the dominions of Ethel∣wald. Now it appears not at all likely that he would advance so far to the southward, without first making sure of what was behind him, and subduing those provinces which, through all the former part of his reign, he had been so anxious of having under his subjection. And, lastly, it is well known that Strean∣shalh Abbey was the monastery, or nunnery, he founded in consequence of his vow, which certainly would never have been the case if he had not considered that place as situate in his own dominions. Therefore we may reasonably conclude, that the sovereignty of Deira henceforward remained in Oswy, and that Ethelwald, though he was permitted to live, on account of his consanguinity to Oswy, never more exer∣cised the regal power, but lived as a private man on his own patrimonial estate, or on some lands belong∣ing to the crown, which his uncle might suffer him to enjoy.</NOTE>. No sooner was he rested from fatigue, than he performed the vow, by giving his child Elfleda, scarce one year old, to be brought up in the holy Church. He granted also the promised lands for religious foundations; six farm-holds in the province of Bernicia, and the same number in Deira. Early in the Saxon Church, religious women, after the example of monastic orders, associated themselves in holy sisterhoods, and some assumed a superiority in those houses. Bede says, <Q>That Hereswide, mother to “Adulphe, king of the East-Angles, lived under religious rule and discipline with her sister in a monastery in France; where, having resided for one year, she was invited into Britain by Aidan, and the lands of a lordship, on the north shore of the Were, were granted her, where she lived, with several religious women, under monastic rules for a year, after which she was elected abbess of
<PB N="10" REF="52"/>the monastery of Heortheu, now Hartlepoole, which had been built not long before by the devout woman Heiu, who is said to be the first in the province of Northumberland that took the vow and habit of a nun, being professed and con∣secrated ”by Aidan.</Q> On her leaving this monastery to settle at Colchester, she was succeeded at Heortheu by <Q>Hilda, who conducted the same with regularity of “life and discipline for several years, and at length built the monastery of Stranes∣halch, now Whitby, where she spent the remainder of her life. Oswy's de∣voted daughter entered the monastery of Heortheu, or, as it is called in another place, Hartesilond, there to be brought up under Hilda, the abbess, in monastic ”discipline.</Q></P>
<P>Several authors alledge, that the battle before spoken of was fought in the pro∣vince of Bernicia, at a place called Winwidfield, near the river Winwid. Others fix it at a spot called Loidis, which, as was before observed, Camden interprets Leeds; but this will not correspond with the province of Bernicia, the southern limit of which was the Tees. Bede says it was fought near the river Imet. From the name of the river, and also from the name of the place, it is probable the battle was fought at Whinfield, not far from Lodor, on the banks of the river Emot, or Emont.</P>
<P>Oswy, pursuing his success, subjugated the kingdom of Mercia. He entertain∣ed Peada, the son of Penda, with great friendship; and, discovering in him singu∣lar virtues, on his consenting to become a Christian, gave him his daughter Alc∣fleda, whom he had by a concubine, in marriage, resigning to him the govern∣ment of the southern parts of Mercia, separated from the northern by the Trent.</P>
<P>Oswy had in him a strange mixture of virtues and vices; in the beginning, bloody and tyrannous; towards his latter end, just and moderate. He was highly addict∣ed to superstition, and the blood of Oswine continually hung upon his conscience; to expiate which, he vowed to make a pilgrimage to Rome; but, falling sick, death frustrated his project. He reigned twenty-eight years, and died 15th Fe∣bruary 670, in the 58th year of his age.</P>
<P>All the ancient historians are silent as to the fate of Ethelwald. Rapin says, but quotes no authority, that, dying without heirs, two years after the battle of Winwid, Deira devolved on Oswy:—And some still later writers seem to have adopted his opinion, with no better support. It seems most probable, that he was deposed immediately after the victory.</P>
<P>Oswy had by Eanfled his queen, two sons and one daughter: Egfrid, the eldest, succeeded to the united crowns of Deira and Bernicia: Elswin, the youngest, fell in battle at the age of eighteen. Elfleda, the daughter, took the veil, as before mentioned, and became abbess of Whitby, where she died. Eansled, his widowed queen, retired to the same monastery, where she spent the remainder of her life, and was interred with the remains of Oswy and Elfleda. Oswy had, by his concu∣bines, two children; Alcfrid, who succeeded Ethelwald in Deira, and, at last, his brother Egsrid, on the whole throne of Northumberland; and Alcsleda, who was married to Peada, Penda's son, and, by most writers, charged with the death of her husband.</P>

The religious tendency of this mat∣ter was undoubtedly of importance in those times, and the maintenance of uni∣formity would have a great effect in vulgar minds: Besides, there was likely to arise much confusion, even in the royal household, by the different times of hold∣ing the festival; for the queen having been brought up where the Romish orders prevailed, held to those rules; so that it sometimes happened, the king and his courtiers were enjoying the holy festival at the same time that the queen and her
<PB N="12" REF="54"/>suite were in the solemnity of Lent. To put an end to all disagreeable conse∣quences, and that uniformity might be maintained, the king appointed a time for the matter to be argued in the monastery of Whitby, before the abbess Hilda, who had a celebrated character for piety and godly works. This convention, or synod, was held in the year 664, the king and his son being present. Colman was commanded to explain and support the Scottish rules, which he did chiefly by the example of St John the Evangelist. Wilfrid replied, and opposed the bishop's ar∣guments, even on his own principles, from the practice of St John. He appears, from the relation, to have had greater powers of eloquence, and more knowledge in disputation. When Colman insisted on the sanctity of those whose example the Scottish Church followed, Wilfrid judiciously seized the spirit of his adversary's argument, and closed his speech with this memorable text of scripture; <Q><HI>Thou “art Peter, and on this rock will I build my Church, and the gates of Hell shall not ”prevail against it: And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of Heaven.</HI></Q> Struck with this powerful text, and with Wilfrid's assertion, that the Romish usage was supported by Peter's own example; and all parties confessing, that the words of scripture were justly set forth, the king immediately determined for the Romish custom. Colman was so much disgusted, that, after having filled the see only three years, he left Lindisfarne, taking with him about thirty English priests, and all his own countrymen, who persevered in the usages of the Scottish Church. He carried with him some of Aidan's bones as holy relics. Few testimonies re∣main of this prelate's private character; but from those few it is evident, he was an intemperate bigot, sullen and resentful, proud, and impatient of contradiction.</P>
<P>During the thirty years this see had been established, we hear of no endow∣ments or grants of lands, except the island of Lindisfarne, for the maintenance of the episcopal dignity, or the monastic society. Oblations, and the gifts of kings in money or cattle, were all the means of their subsistence; and of those they dispensed frequently to the poor.</P>
<P>TUDA, after Colman had thus disgracefully abdicated the see, succeeded, being the first bishop of Lindisfarne who held the Romish modes. He was educated among the southern Scottish clergy, by whom he was ordained bishop<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wharton's Angl. Sacra.</NOTE>. Bede says, <Q>He was “a man of great virtue and holiness, but governed this Church a short time. He had left Scotland whilst Colman was bishop, to teach the gospel, and was an excellent example of piety. In the year 664, a great eclipse of the sun happened on the third day of May, about ten o'clock; and, in the same year, a horrid pesti∣lence raged, which, passing through the southern parts of Britain, at length reached Northumberland, where great numbers died, amongst whom was our ”holy prelate.</Q></P>
<P>Bede's remarks on the succession of Scottish bishops, ending in Tuda, are too honourable to be omitted. <Q>Their frugality, simplicity of life, and parsimony,
<PB N="13" REF="55"/>“appeared in the place of their residence, in which there was nothing superflu∣ous or unnecessary for the humblest life. In the Church only, magnificence was permitted. Their possessions consisted chiefly in cattle, for money was only re∣tained till a fit opportunity offered to distribute it to the poor. Places of enter∣tainment and reception of princes were unnecessary; for the religious were vi∣sited solely for their doctrines, and the holy offices of the Church. When the king came there, he was attended only by five or six persons, and had no other object in view than to partake of the rites of religion, departing immediately after the service: If perchance they took refreshment, it was of the common fare of the monks. The attention of those pastors was confined to spiritual matters only: Temporal affairs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bede means the acquiring of lands and possessions, and such worldly concerns.</NOTE> were deemed derogatory to their holy ap∣pointment; and thence proceeded the profound veneration which was paid by all ranks of people to the religious habit. When any ecclesiastic went from his monastery, it was to preach the word of salvation, and he was every where re∣ceived with joy, as a messenger of the Divinity: On the road, the passengers bowed the head, to receive the holy benediction and sign of the Cross; with pious reverence treasuring up the good man's precepts, as documents of the most salutary import. The churches were crouded with a devout audience; and when a monk was seen entering a village in his travels, the inhabitants flocked about him, entreating for his admonitions and prayers. On their visitations, dona∣tions and riches were not their pursuit; and when any religious society received an augmentation to the revenues of the house, as an offering of charity by the donor, they accepted it for an additional store, with which they were entrusted ”for the benefit of the poor.</Q></P>
<P>CEDDA.</P>
<P>In 664, the year in which Tuda died, a great change took place in Lindisfarne, which hitherto had been the episcopal seat, and supreme church in Northumber∣land; but, upon Cedda's consecration, York was made the bishop's residence, and he assumed the dignity of metropolitan. From this period, for fourteen years, Lindisfarne wanted its proper bishop<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Anglia Sacra.</NOTE>. The monastery entertained a numerous body of religious, who bore the most approved character for their sanctity of manners. It is said that Colman, before his abdication, on behalf of this vene∣rable society, petitioned Oswy to appoint Eata, who then governed the house of Melros, to be their abbot. He was one of the twelve youths whom Aidan chose out of the Angles to educate; and, before Aidan's death, was elected to the go∣vernment of Melros. Eata being translated to the abbacy of Lindisfarne in the year 664, brought with him Cuthbert, whom he made prior<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Symeon Dunelm. p. 32.—Angl. Sacra.—Lel. Col. v. ii. so. 368.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There are great contradictions touching the time of Cedda's promotion, some having asserted, that it was obtained through the influence of Egfrid: But this will in no wise correspond with the chronology maintained by the best histo∣rians.
<PB N="14" REF="56"/>Wharton says, Cedda presided from 664 to 669, which periods were in the reign of Oswy, who did not die till the year 670. It is certain he was made bishop, by the title of Bishop of York; and he is said by some to have received two consecrations, one during a vacancy of the see of Canterbury, and the other by Theodore, at York: But the contrary will appear in the sequel. Rapin says, <Q>“Oswy's tender affection for his natural son Alcfred, induced him to divide Nor∣thumberland again, and make him king of Deira, though contrary to the people's inclination. The Deirians, upon Oswy's death, revolted against Alc∣fred, and put themselves under the dominion of Egfrid, who thereby became king of all Northumberland. Alcfred retired into Ireland, where he applied himself chiefly to his studies, in expectation of a favourable opportunity to re∣cover his dominions." Rapin gives no authority for this; neither is it support∣ed by any of the monastic writers, except in the words of Bede<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. iii. c. 28.</NOTE>. In the mean time Alcfred send Wilfrid his priest to the king of France, that he might be con∣secrated bishop in his dominions. Wilfrid making some stay after his consecra∣tion, Oswy, following his son's diligence and example, sent into Kent a holy man, learned in the scriptures, of a virtuous life, and a strict observer of all religious duties, to be created bishop of York. He was abbot of Lestingham. On his arrival in Kent, finding Deusdedit archbishop of Canterbury dead, and no one appointed to the See, he travelled into the country of the West Saxons, where Wini was bishop, and by him this virtuous man Cedda was consecrated, two other bishops assisting in the ceremony. Having carefully attended his charge above three years, he was admonished by Theodore, who had succeeded to the metropolitan See of Canterbury, that he was not lawfully and rightfully called to the episcopacy. The good man, with great condescension and humi∣lity, at the instance of Oswy, relinquished the see, and retired to his monastery, from whence he was soon after, by Theodore's influence, made bishop of Litch∣field, A. D. 669." Bede also says, "That during his being bishop of York, he was continually visiting the cities, towns, and villages, and even conde∣scended to sojourn in private houses, to preach the gospel. He refused the in∣dulgence ”of riding, constantly making his journies on foot, as the apostles did.</Q> It appears, that Theodore, to conciliate the minds of Oswy and his son, had in∣fluenced Cedda's resignation, in order to give place to Wilfrid. Theodore was born at Tarsus in Cilicia, a man of deep erudition and approved morals, and was consecrated metropolitan by Pope Vitalian. He was the first archbishop of Can∣terbury that was universally submitted to by the English Church; for, preceding his time, the bishops of the kingdom of Northumberland were independent. On Theodore's visitation of the northern churches, he reformed their usages, and cor∣rected a multitude of their customs. When he objected to Cedda's consecration, and his having been obtruded on the See of York after Wilfrid was elected to it, and especially that he had received consecration from the Scottish bishops, the holy prelate made this modest reply, <Q>That if he questioned the manner of his pro∣motion
<PB N="15" REF="57"/>“he was willing to lay down his authority; for that he always thought himself unworthy of the episcopal character, and took it upon him only in obe∣dience ”to his superiors.</Q> Cedda lived after a most exemplary and seraphic manner, and, as Bede reports, had a visit from angels, who discovered to him the time of his death. He also gives many instances of his piety, and holy works<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. iv.</NOTE>. He died March 2, 672, and was interred at Litchfield, where a rich shrine was erected to his memory.</P>
<P>It is remarked by Malmsbury, that neither Colman, nor his predecessors Aidan or Finan, notwithstanding they governed the diocese of York, which had been ad∣vanced to a metropolitical privilege, would ever make use of the pall. Indeed, if they would have taken up this distinction, they must have assumed it by their own act, there being no correspondence maintained between them and the Pope. For this reason, Malmsbury says, that when Wilfrid was elected to the See of York with general approbation, he refused the appointment, for fear of being obliged to re∣ceive his ordination from the Scottish prelates, looking on them to be little better than schismaticks, which was the reason of his travelling for his consecration in∣to France<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 368.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WILFRID, as observed before, who had been preceptor to Alcfred, and in great favour with him, was born of mean parents in Northumberland, and continued in his father's house, without any education, till he was fourteen years of age. On some dis∣gust he fled from his parents, and by accident met with one who had influence at York, to whom his father had rendered some services. This person observing Wilfrid's graceful person, and the quickness of his natural genius, recommended him to the queen's protection. Cudda, formerly the king's chamberlain, had re∣tired to the monastery of Lindisfarne, and was become a monk: To him Eanfleda committed the care of Wilfrid's education, who continued at Lindisfarne to the age of eighteen, and afterwards finished his studies at Rome. In order to obtain his ordination to the See of York, he went into France; but tarrying there too long, Oswy's patience being exhausted, Cedda was consecrated in his absence, and Wilfrid, on his return, finding the prelate's chair already occupied, and not willing to oppose the king's pleasure, retired to the monastery of Ripon, where he remained till Theodore's visitation; when, by Cedda's resignation, he took pos∣session of the See in peace.</P>
<P>Egfrid's accession to the united thrones of Northumberland took place in the year 670. He had been long held in Mercia as an hostage, whence he returned with his father's victorious army. He had attained his twenty-fifth year when he began to reign, and soon displayed a martial genius, with other great powers of mind; but, by an impetuous temper, involved himself in a series of troubles and misfortunes. The Mercians had revolted, and put their virtuous prince Peada to death, placing on the throne a creature of their own, whose first act of power was
<PB N="16" REF="58"/>to expel the Northumbrians from his territories. Egfrid, vain of the power so lately gained, and impatient of the injuries done his crown by the revolt, made war upon Mercia, and much bloodshed ensued. On the borders of the Trent the armies came to an engagement, in which Elfwin, the Northumbrian king's brother, was slain, with many valiant chieftains, and a vast host on both sides<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i. p. 138.</NOTE>. Elfwin, who had attained his eighteenth year, was lamented by all, as well for his excellent qualities, as his alliance to both princes, he having married Osfrida, the Mercian king's sister.</P>
<P>Theodore put a stop to the farther effusion of blood, which had hitherto pro∣duced no advantage to either party, and, by a judicious interposition, reconciled the contending princes, and brought about a peace on eligible terms.</P>
<P>Soon after his coming to the See of York, Wilfrid founded the monastery of Hexham, about the year 674, having obtained Hexhamshire as a gift to religious uses from Etheldrida, Egfrid's queen. Malmsbury says, <Q>This was crown-land, “”when Wilfrid obtained it of the queen in exchange;</Q> but leaves it in the dark what was given for it. Neither is there any evidence extant of a royal grant of this territory. The church he built there was erected by workmen he brought from Italy and other distant countries, and dedicated it to St Andrew. Historians of that time say, it exceeded in beauty and elegance every other edifice in the land: They particularly praise the variety of the buildings, the columns, the car∣vings, the oratories, and the crypts. They dwell with wonder on the richness of the covers for the altar, the gilding of the walls with gold and silver, and the fine library, collected at a great expence. Etheldrida was daughter of Anna, king of the East-Angles, and was first married to Tonbert, a grandee in her father's court, with whom she lived a virgin three years. After his death, at the command of her father, she espoused Egfrid, with whom she lived twelve years, but refused him connubial rites. This,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. iv. c. 19.</NOTE> Bede declares Wilfrid told him, and, for instance, said, he of all others could testify it, for Wilfrid assured him, the king promised to give him lands and great riches <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he would persuade the queen to submit to his embraces, for he was certain she loved him with the most sincere affection, and valued him above all men. But in this he did not prevail, she being determined to preserve her purity; and having an earnest desire to retire, she frequently en∣treated the king's permission to dedicate her life to the service of Heaven. By re∣peated importunities, at length his consent was obtained, and she entered a mo∣nastery where Ebba was abbess, the king's near relation. Bede says, this religious house stood in a town called Coludi, and that Wilfrid gave the queen the veil and habit. She afterwards became abbess of Ely, and there spent a most exemplary life, practising many severities, such as refusing the use of linen and warm baths, and taking but one meal a-day; continuing in the church at her private devotions, after the times of service, to a late hour, and, as it is said, was blessed with the gift of prophecy. She presided abbess seven years, and, dying of the pestilence, agreeable to her express order, was buried in a wooden tomb. After sixteen years,
<PB N="17" REF="59"/>the body was taken up, to be deposited in one of marble, when it was found un∣corrupted, as Wilfrid, and many others that knew her, testified, among whom was her physician, who had made an incision in a tumour under her armpit, the escar of which remained. Many miracles were said to have been wrought at her tomb. Thomas of Ely<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Eliensis, and Angl. Sac. p. 598.</NOTE> says, that this queen retired to a nunnery at Cawood, near York, where Ebba, king Egfrid's aunt, was abbess. It appears to be a great er∣ror in several authors, who have placed this Ebba at Coldingham.</P>
<P>It is supposed Wilfrid acted a double part in the preceding transaction; for, about this time, he incurred Egbert's severe displeasure. Thomas of Ely adds, that, about a year after the queen's retreat, the king was very desirous of her re∣turn, and designed to force her out of the monastery; of which the abbess recei∣ving intelligence, advised her to quit the house privately, and seek some more se∣cure abode; upon which she retired to Ely; and that the king endeavoured to re∣cover her in vain, and, under this disappointment, married Ermenburg, grew very cool towards Wilfrid, and at length expelled him the country. We find an account of this transaction in Eddius's<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Eddius, c. xliv.</NOTE> History of Wilfrid, different from the former; but, as he was his chaplain, he may be supposed to have wrote favourably of him. He tells us<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eddius Stephanus,</HI> who wrote the life of this prelate as early as the year 720, stiles him no other than <HI>Episcopus Eboracensis</HI> throughout his work. But the titles of bishop and archbishop were indifferently used in those days. The pope himself had then no other title than <HI>bishop of Rome:</HI> But, in the Saxon Annals, to a charter there recited of king Ethelred, this Wilfrid subscribes himself, archbishop of York. Chron. Saxon. p. 43.</NOTE>, that Egfrid had deprived the church of St Peter at York of a considerable estate, and that Wilfrid's urging a restitution, occasioned the king's displeasure. In another place he says, and is supported by Malmsbury, that Ermenburg, Egfrid's second queen, was Wilfrid's enemy; that she endea∣voured to draw an odium upon him, on account of his great revenues in religious houses, the splendour and number of his retinue, and his costly living. This charge was enforced so powerfully, as to make a strong impression upon the king, as well as the archbishop Theodore: But both Eddius and Malmsbury liberally charge the archbishop with bribery, and being a tool of the court. Most authors agree, that Wilfrid was intolerably proud, and lived in a state of magnificence not equalled by princes of that time<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Bede—Rich. Hagust.—Dugdale.</NOTE>. He was artful and insmuating, and knew how to possess the weak moments of zeal and superstition, and did not spare to solicit, or was always eager to accept, extravagant gifts to the church. He built and ornamented, in the most sumptuous manner, his churches and abbies, in which he employed foreign artists, at a vast expence. His magnificence in other respects, was in no ways inferior; for the sons of nobles resided in his house for education; his servants, an infinite number, wore gorgeous apparel; his furniture imitated what he had seen in the palaces of foreign potentates, and he was ser∣ved in vessels of gold. His principal works were, repairing the cathedral of York, the roof of which he covered with lead, and glazed the windows, about the year 670; and building the two magnificent churches of Ripon and Hexham. Eddius
<PB N="18" REF="60"/><GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page missing〉"/> describes him, attended in his journies, when exercising his episcopal function, not only by singers, of whom Eddius himself was one, but by architects and ar∣tists of every kind.</P>
<P>Theodore visiting Northumberland, Rapin says, <Q>Egfrid complained to him of “Wilfrid, and let him know, that, instead of edifying the people, he brought a great scandal on religion by his pride and arrogance. Theodore finding this a fit opportunity to improve the revenues of his See, and lessen those of York, which had been dignified with the title of an archbishopric in the time of Pau∣linus, was resolved not to let it slip. Accordingly, without hearing what Wil∣frid had to say for himself, he deposed him, and obtained the king's leave to ”divide Northumberland into two dioceses.</Q> Whether Theodore was unduly in∣fluenced by the court, certain it is, he was very ready to degrade Wilfrid, whom he esteemed his rival. He pretended the mode of Wilfrid's living, and the ex∣tent of his diocese, were too great, and that there was both revenue and people sufficient within the kingdom of Northumberland for four bishops<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collier—Eddius —Malmsb.</NOTE>. The conse∣quence of this deposition was, that York was severed from Lindisfarne, the limits of the latter being confined to Bernicia. And we are also told, that part of Mercia, being held as an appendage of Northumberland, was then also created a bishopric, by the name of Lindsey. Wilfrid's church of Hexham having hitherto received no dignity superior to that of a monastic church, was confidered in the above act as a member of Lindisfarne. Upon Theodore's thus cantoning the diocese of York, Bosa was consecrated bishop of York, and Eata of Lindisfarne. Eddius reports, that Theodore had no prelate to assist at the consecration, which was contrary to the fourth canon of the council of Nice. These transactions appear to have been in the year 678<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Wharton's Angl. Sacr.—Symeon Dunelm. p. 44.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Wilfrid, heated with resentment, hasted to the royal presence, to implore a re∣dress of grievances; but his hopes were dashed by the unfavourable countenance shewn him by every one at court. The queen exclaimed against the rapid increase of church possessions, as threatening danger to the state. The king confessed he had no criminal charge against Wilfrid, yet justified what Theodore had done on no other principles, than that he was resolved to satisfy his own pleasure, in which he would not be controuled. Wilfrid told the king, his injuries should not rest there, for that he would appeal to the pope; at which the courtiers burst into a contemptuous fit of laughter. It seemsby this irreverence, that the court of Eg∣frid denied the right of such appeals; or that it was grown fashionable, be the enormity ever so great, to flatter the prince's passions. Wilfrid still burning with resentment, and disappointed ambition, hastened into Italy; and, after many crosses in the way, at length he arrived in Rome, where, being well esteemed, he soon obtained a chapter. His sufferings were much condemned, and he returned with the pope's resolution in form for his restoration.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="61"/>
<P>EATA had not long ejoyed his new dignity, before Theodore thought proper to inter∣meddle with the possessions of his See; and, severing Hexham from Lindisfarne, erected there a new bishopric. This happened about three years after Wilfrid's departure for Rome, Tumbert being consecrated bishop of Hexham in the year 680. Eata could not brook this injury; for though he had been advanced to the episcopal dignity by Theodore's authority, and had risen on the spoils of Wilfrid, yet he thought proper on this occasion to question the metropolitan's jurisdiction, and, in the warmth of resentment, avowed he had no power over the northern churches. Theodore summoned a convention on the banks of Aln in 684, when Eata, for his contumacy, was deposed. But Theodore, perhaps afraid of a se∣cond appeal to the papal chair, thought it expedient not entirely to degrade a man of such exalted character, and, to soften the rigour of the decree, translated him to Hexham; and Tumbert, who had given few testimonies of worth, and had been an adherent of Eata, in denying Theodore's authority, was deposed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i. p. 327. v. ii. p. 338.—Ang. Sacra.</NOTE>. There is something obscure in the ancient authors, touching the original division of Nor∣thumberland, as if Hexham was immediately erected into a bishopric, and Lin∣disfarne left open for Wilfrid. If the reader is curious to enquire farther, he is referred to the quotations below<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Symeon Dunclm. p. 44.—Bede, lib. iv. c 12.28.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Egfrid, not content with governing his own people in peace, in 684 sent his forces against the Irish, under the conduct of Bertfred, an experienced general, hoping to conquer the country. Bede represents them as a mild and inoffensive people, constantly desirous of maintaining peace with Britain: Nor does any au∣thor assign a plausible pretext for his attacking them. Much bloodshed ensued, and the Saxon general, in outrageous cruelty, put the ecclesiastics to death, pilla∣ged and destroyed churches and religious houses. The islanders, at first intimi∣dated, fled before him; but at length, exasperated by this barbarity, and armed with despair, they turned upon the Saxons, who were every where discomfited, and beaten back to the coast; and Bertfred was compelled to embark with the broken remains of his army, having left the flower of the Northumbrian youth dead in this useless expedition, in which nothing was purchased but an odium up∣on the character of Egfrid.</P>
<P>Wilfrid returning to Britain, big with the papal mandate, obtruded himself on the royal presence; but, to his great mortification, found the king exasperated at his insolence: And it appears that Egfrid expressed his utter contempt of the sen∣tence, reproached Wilfrid for having procured it by bribery and other illicit means, and, as a presumptuous offender against the royal dignity, ordered him into close durance. The devout Ebba, anxious for the cause of religion, which must suffer in the vulgar eye by such acts of severity against the dignified clergy, and tou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d with the deposed bishop's lamentable situation, interceded with the king for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is

<PB N="20" REF="64"/>liberty, which was obtained after nine months imprisonment, on condition that he never afterwards entered the kingdom of Northumberland. Wilfrid travelled in∣to Mercia, where he was kindly entertained, and had lands given him for erecting and maintaining a monastery: But he was quickly forced from this retreat; for the Mercian king, who had married Egfrid's sister, coming to the knowledge of banishment, ordered him to quit his territories. He then sought protection amongst the West-Saxons, but it was not long before he was again pursued by Egfrid's re∣sentment, and his queen's hatred, who sent agents to procure his dislodgment. And thus he was hunted from one country to another, it being impracticable for him to live in any prince's dominions where the Northumbrian monarch had in∣fluence.</P>
<P>The South-Saxons were yet Heathens. Wilfrid, under the afflictions of such enmity and adversity, was induced to travel into that country to preach the gospel; where the people received a strong impression in his favour, and entertained a high opinion of his holiness, from a mere accidental circumstance. The country, by a great drought, suffered famine: After having baptized a multitude of people, he kneeled down to prayer, in the open field, and behold abundant showers of rain fell to replenish the earth. To relieve the immediate hunger of the inhabi∣tants, he taught them to fish with nets, by which means they obtained a comfort∣able supply. By his labours amongst the South-Saxons it appears, that he wrought their conversion; for he erected a bishopric in Selsey, and continued in that coun∣try during Egfrid's life.</P>
<P>On the degradation of Tumbert, at the same synod, held at Twyford on the Aln, CUTHBERT was unanimously elected bishop of the See of Hexham. To this eminent person∣age, from whose religious memory so much is derived in the course of this work, great attention is due. By some he is said to have been descended of royal blood in Ireland; his father's name Muriardack, and his mother's Sabina, who, going a pilgrimage, left their son for education at Melros<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Goodwin.</NOTE>. But it is generally agreed that he was born of obscure parents, and, in his early years, followed the em∣ployment of a shepherd. Bede and Turgot (alias Symeon) would not have ne∣glected to mention his better birth, as they sought every occasion to praise him, had there been any foundation for it. It has been already observed, that, whilst feeding his flocks on the banks of Leder, he had a beatific vision, and saw St Aidan's spirit ascend up to heaven<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Symeon Dunelm. p. 24.</NOTE>. Whether moved by this supernatural cause or not, he applied to the abbey of Melros, where, in 651, he gained admittance and initiation, under Eata and Boisilus, and there became a monk. His exemplary virtue and conduct were such, that, when Eata was removed from Melros to the abbacy of Lindisfarne, Cuthbert consented to attend him, and was made prior.

<PB N="21" REF="66"/>During fourteen years residence at Melros, the religious fraternity entertained the highest veneration and love for his character. On Eata's consecration, Cuthbert became abbot of Lindisfarne, and, as Bede says, <Q>by his example and diligence, “he instructed and brought over many to a regular life and discipline, not only within the limits of the monastery, but also in the adjacent country. By his piety and teaching, he laboured to recover the people from their erroneous life and conversation, inspiring them with the true love of holiness, and the hope of heaven. Many at that time had fallen into superstitions, forsaking the true faith, and, in the hours of death, and under the tremendous visitations of the plague, neglecting the holy offices of the church, and the true consolation of religious faith, resorted to sorceries and idolatry, endeavouring by inchant∣ments and witchcrafts, secret arts and invocations of the devil, to counteract the visitations of heaven. To correct such dreadful errors, this holy father frequently travelled from Lindisfarne, sometimes on horseback, but more com∣monly on foot, and, passing into the villages, brought back such as were fal∣len into errors. He had such powers of elocution, such a zeal in his exhorta∣tions, such a placid and divine countenance, with penetrating looks, that none durst stand in his presence without confessing his sins. He was accustomed to resort to the meaner habitations among the mountains, where most preachers were afraid, or disdained to go, because of the wretched dwellings, and miser∣able way of life, as well as ferocity of the inhabitants: Yet he so diligently gave himself up to this duty, that sometimes, on those journies, he did not re∣turn to the monastery for a month together; but, all that time, sojourned among the mountains, with the poorest people, preaching to them, and, by his holy ”example, persuading to a religious life.</Q></P>
<P>Cuthbert having dwelt in the monastery about twelve years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Symeon Dunelm. p. 39.</NOTE>, and conceiving that a monastic life afforded enjoyments incompatible with contemplation and the service of the Deity, retired from thence, and commenced the life of an ancho∣rite in the largest of the Farne Islands, which lies opposite to Bambrough, and within sight of his monastery, being distant from thence only about two leagues. Bede says, on his going thither, he expressed himself to his brethren, <Q>If I am “permitted, by the grace and goodness of God, to subsist there by the labour of my hands, I will gladly abide in that situation: If that is denied me, I shall quickly return to you." "Now this place was destitute of wood, water, and grain of every kind, and also unfit for human dwelling, because of the wicked ”spirits and fiends that haunted it.</Q> With the assistance of his brethren he built a cell, with a small oratory, and surrounded them with a wall, which cut off the view of every object but that of heaven. He could not have chosen a place more adapted to a life of mortification and severity, being on a stormy coast, sur∣rounded by rugged rocks, over which the sea incessantly breaks with horrid tu∣mult, destitute of fresh water, without tree for shelter or ornament, or shrub bear∣ing even the meanest fruit; nothing wherewith to sustain human life; and, to
<PB N="22" REF="67"/>complete the scene of wretchedness, said to be haunted by devils. Miraculous was the change indeed, according to the legend. From the rocks issued fountains of water; under the tillage of his holy hands, the soil produced barley; trees and shrubs, by his care, flourished abundantly; the storms abated, the plains were co∣vered with verdure, the evil spirits were bound in eternal darkness, and ministers of grace repeatedly visited him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The last isle I visited, was the House Island, the sequestered spot where St Cuthbert passed the two last years of his life. Here was afterwards established a priory of Benedictines, for six or eight monks, subor∣dinate to Durham. A square tower, the remains of a church, and some other buildings, are to be seen there still, and a stone coffin, which it is pretended was that of St Cuthbert. At the no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th end of the isle is a deep chasm, from the top to the bottom of the rock, communicating to the sea; through which, in tempestuous weather, the water is forced with vast violence and noise, and forms a fine jet d' eau of sixty feet high. It is called by the inhabitants of the opposite coast, the Churn.—Pennant's Tour in Scotland, p. 38.
<P>In Bede's Life of St Cuthbert, we are told the Saint's cell was not the only erection on the island, for there was a larger house near the landing place, where the brethren, who came to visit him, lodged. After the death of St Cuthbert, several persons successively occupied this hermitage. Thomas, prior of Dur∣ham, retired to Farne in the years 1162 and 1163. He had engaged in a controversy with that arrogant pre∣late, Hugh bishop of Durham, touching certain liberties which the monks of that church prompted him to maintain, and who, afterwards deserting him, induced Hugh to procure his deposition. In the year 1238, Thomas the second, of Melsonby, succeeded in Farne Isle, where he died. He was elected to the See of Durham, but opposed by the king.</P>
<P>In commemoration of these examples of religious severity, a priory was founded here, subordinate to Durham, with a revenue of 13 marks from the corporation of Newcastle. The endowment at the dissolu∣tion was estimated at £. 12 ∶ 17 ∶ 8. K. Hen. VIII. in the 33d year of his reign, granted it to the dean and chapter of Durham.—The remains of these edifices are very ragged and confused, and shew little other than marks of severity and inconvenience, notwithstanding the happy taste which is denoted in the scites of most of the religious houses of the same date. A part of a square tower is standing, which was built by Thomas Castell, prior of Durham, in the beginning of the 15th century. Part of the priory is also remaining.</P>
<P>These erections are on the best part of the island: A little lawn skirts the edisices, surrounded with rug∣ged rocks, from whence issues a spring of fresh water. Since the departure of the religious, this island has returned almost to its pristine state. It consists of a few acres in the whole surface, the chief part of which is sand and rock. A scanty herbage takes place indeed in some spots, especially on the little lawn; but there is neither tree or shrub. The shore is rocky, and sounding to the hollow sea which rolls upon it, sending forth a horrid howling. The north-east winds blow fiercely here, and every inclemency of wea∣ther known to the climate beats on these inhospitable shores, which are tremendous from frequent ship∣wrecks. There is not a coast more likely to give one the idea of shoals of wandering spirits, who visit the <HI>semisepulta ossa,</HI> over which they loiter on this side Styx, whilst unfriendly whirlwinds cover the remains with sand, and forbid the funeral rites for which the spirits languish.—View of Northumberland.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In this solitude Cuthbert lived for nine years preceding the synod at Twyford on Aln, where he was elected to the episcopacy in 684. He shewed great reluc∣tance to this new dignity, at first positively refusing the nomination, being de∣termined not to quit his cell, and the austerities he had made habitual to him. But upon the king's sailing over to the island, accompanied by bishop Trumwine, many nobles and religious, who were present at the synod, he was prevailed upon by the tears of his sovereign, who, with the whole company, are said to have kneeled, and adjured him in the name of God to take upon him the sacred office. He was consecrated at York, on the 7th day of April, being Easter day, in the year 685, and in the 11th of the reign of king Egfrid, who was present at the consecration. He was first made bishop of Hexham, but having a partiality to Lindisfarne, was translated thither, and Eata was sent to Hexham.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="68"/>
<P>Eata did not long survive those changes. Cuthbert's consecration was in the last year of Egfrid's reign, and Eata died in the first year of his successor. There is not an imputation on the life and character of Eata, but that single error of incurring the displeasure of the metropolitan, under whose auspices he had recei∣ved his dignity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. iv. c. 26. lib. v. c. 2. and Anglia Sacra.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It was the custom of Lindisfarne, from the first erection of the See, for the bishop and his clergy to reside with the abbot and monks; and the monks were, as Bede observes, immediately under the bishop's jurisdiction, and sometimes the same person was both abbot and bishop. It must be observed, that Cuthbert's acceptance of this See, after Theodore's severance of the diocese of York, is by Collier, and other writers, taken up as a cause of imputation, as a tacit confirma∣tion of the wrathful purposes of Egfrid, against the persecuted Wilfrid<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Symeon Dunelm. p. 46.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Before Cuthbert's consecration, the northern churches received few endowments of lands. Of the gift of Hexhamshire no record is extant; nor of a decennarie, or territory of ten households for the religious society of women at Weremouth; and that at Hartlepool was another for which there is no better authority.

<P>Haec donatio scripta est tempore Agathonis Papae, anno aetatis regis Egfridi 40, regni vero ejus 15°<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This charter, by some, is held to be sictitious. Cedde died in the year 664. Sexulfus was not made bishop of the Mercians till after Ceadda's death, who is also said to have signed this charter, and who did not die till 672. See Appendix to Smith's Edit. of Bede's works, No. 22. Though these circum∣stances impeach the authenticity of the record greatly, yet, as it has been accepted by several grave and learned historians, I think it best to giv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it a place here, with equal attention, as others have done.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Two things are remarkable in this grant; one that it expresses to be made by the advice of the bishops, and of the whole council; and that it gives the lands and tenements to the bishop, and his successors, in that large and ample tenure, <HI>"ita sicut ego habui,"</HI> as fully and amply as the king himself held the same. When the nature of the Saxon tenure of lands at that day is considered, those words have a latitude more singular than at first sight they may seem to bear; for they carry with them a special jurisdiction and authority. Besides the territories included in the preceding grant, Egfrid gave to St Cuthbert's See all the lands from the walls of the church of St Peter in York, to the west gate of the city, and from the same church to the city wall on the south. From this period church-possessions began to increase in the north; the religious were no longer content with oblations, but grasped after landed property and civil power.</P>
<P>Some short time preceding St Cuthbert's consecration, the monastery of Col∣dingham was burnt. The religious society there consisted of monks and nuns, who occupied separate parts of the edifice. But the severe rules of the house were not sufficient to prevent a shameful relaxation of discipline; insomuch, that the destruction of that stately edifice was considered a judgment, on the crimes and pollutions of its inhabitants. The monastery of Lindisfarne looked upon this event with religious horror, and soon after Cuthbert was made bishop, he forbade the approach of women to the convent, and even denied them access to the church, where the monks performed their devotions. He caused a small chapel to be erected on a distant plain on the island for their reception, which, from its situation, was called the green church. Women were afterwards excluded churches or cemeteries where St Cuthbert's body rested; and some miraculous punishments are related which attended infringements on this rule.</P>
<P>Soon after Cuthbert was settled in the See, Egfrid, from a restless disposition, or ambitious for extent of dominion, levied a great army, and marched into the territories of the Picts, contrary, as said by several writers<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bede— Rapin —Cum mul. al.</NOTE>, to the opinion of his council, and the prophetic admonitions of his bishop, who foretold the ruinous consequence of the expedition. He ravaged the borders, and, flushed with success, pursued the flying enemy into the heart of the country, among mountains and de∣files, to which his people were strangers, and where little or no forage was to be obtained. When his troops were fainting with fatigue and famine, he understood, too late, that the flying natives had only made a feint to draw him forward, whilst their main body seized those defiles and straits in the mountains by which he must necessarily return. He was constrained to fight his way at a great disadvantage, and fell in the field, with half of his army. The Picts pursued their advantage,
<PB N="25" REF="70"/>and regained all that extensive territory the Northumbrians had at different pe∣riods annexed to their crown. From this fatal overthrow, the throne of Northum∣berland began to diminish in power and splendour, and never afterwards possessed those extensive bounds of dominion which it did at the commencement of Eg∣frid's reign<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The place of this defeat is by some supposed to be on the banks of Solway Frith, and by others al∣ledged to be further northward, which they support by Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being the place of Egfrid's sepulture. —Bor∣der Hist.—Bede—Symeon, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The royal remains were interred in the island of Hii.</P>
<P>Egfrid, though twice married, left no issue; his brother Alcfrid, coming from his retreat in Ireland, ascended the throne. The queen, Ermenburga, according to Symeon and others, was professed in the nunnery at Carlisle, Cuthbert giving her the veil.</P>
<P>Cuthbert enjoyed his change of life and dignities but a very short time; for, within two years, finding his health declining, and his mind being by habit tem∣pered more for solitude and silence than the duties of his high office, he resigned the See, and returned to his cell in Farne, where he survived only two months, departing this life on the 20th day of March 687, in the 53d year of the erection of the See of Lindisfarne, and 37 years after he had assumed the monastic habit at Melros<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Wharton, Goodwin, &amp;c.—In the Philosophical Transactions, N<SUP>o</SUP> 247 and 260, and in Gibson's edit. of the Britannia, a curious jewel, representing St Cuthbert, is deseribed, found near Athelney in So∣mersetshire.

<P>Mr Wallis, speaking of this portrait, has the following remarks:— <Q>King Alfred preferred these cha∣racters “to the Saxon, and when he swayed the sceptre, brought them into use. This curious memorial of St Cuthbert was found in the very place of that glorious monarch's retreat and deliveran<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> from the ”Danes, fortified by him in the time of war, and in the time of peace converted into a monastery.</Q> Dr Musgrave (who wrote a dissertation thereon), thinks this curious Cimolium an undeniable instance of the use of images coming from the Heathens into the Christian church. Dr Hickes has engraven it in his The∣saurus, and is of opinion, that the occasion of it was the vision of St Cuthbert, which William of Malms∣bury speaks of, appearing to him and his mother the same night, (aster he had been beaten by the Danes, and retired into Athelney), and assuring him that he should be a grent king. In memory whereof we may well suppose, that the image upon it is St Cuthbert's, (to whose merit he was wont to afcribe his future successes over the Danes), and not only so, but being plainly made, on purpose to hang on a string, it is very probable that himself constantly wore it, in honour to this his t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>telar faint.—It is said to be now in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford.—See Archaeologia, vol. ii. p. 68.72.</P>

<P>So dear was this saint to King Alfred, that he made him share with him in his sovereignty, and honoured his name upon his coin, stamped on one side with AELFRED REX; on the other, CVDBERHT.</P></NOTE>. He expressed an earnest desire to be interred near his little oratory in Farne; and it is said a stone coffin was prepared for him, the gift of Cedda; and a piece of fine linen, which Viria, the abbess of Tynemouth, presented to
<PB N="26" REF="71"/>him, was carefully laid up to wrap his remains in. But the monks of Lindisfarne prevailed with the bishop to permit his body to be interred in their church, where it was deposited with great funeral pomp, first in the cemetery of the old church, and afterwards, on occasion of the cathedral being rebuilt, on the right side of the high altar. For his exemplary piety and virtue, the Church inrolled him in the table of Saints.</P>
<P>Symeon says, that St Cuthbert, on his death-bed, implored the monks to re∣move his remains, in case the island should be distressed by the ravages of Pa∣gans, or an enemy who paid no veneration to the Christian church, and from thence his panegyrists infer, that he had a prophetic idea of the troubles which would ensue, or of the enthusiastic veneration which future ages would pay to his ashes.</P>
<P>The public works ascribed to him, are the foundation of a monastery at Crake, restoring the nunnery at Carlisle, and establishing a school there, for the advance∣ment of religion.</P>
<P>St Cuthbert was remarkable for an unshaken serenity of temper, and meekness of demeanour; by preserving which, and persevering in his admonitions, he over∣came the oppositions of the refractory, and brought the religious, especially those of his own convent, to submit to the most rigid monastic rules<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bede.</NOTE>.

<P>ALCFRID, whilst in Ireland, applied himself closely to the study of philosophy, and revealed religion; and is spoken of by writers of antiquity, as one of the most learned and religious princes of that age.</P>
<P>By the unsuccessful wars of Egfrid, the limits of the Northumbrian kingdom were greatly diminished; the Welch had made incroachments on the western bound∣ary, and the Picts retained what they had recovered, so as to shut in his dominion within Solway and the Tweed. Whatever success he had against the Picts, produ∣ced no happier issue than to secure those limits. About the 13th year of his reign Brithricus, otherwise Bertus, a general of great character, fell in an enterprize a∣gainst that people<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hollingshead—Bede—Math.

<P>Although no great success in arms give honours to this reign, yet the king's wise government, and salutary laws, procured to him immortal fame: His people were happy under his administration, and his prudent maxims laid the foundation of

<P>Archbishop Theodore, declining in health and strength, grew anxious to relieve his conscience from the severities he had exercised against Wilfrid, sought there∣fore to regain his friendship; and, through his interest with the king, and earnest solicitations in his favour, obtained his restoration. At Wilfrid's return into the Northumbrian dominions, the king put him in possession of his church of Hex∣ham, St John of Beverley having vacated that See on his translation to York. It appears that Wilfrid, during a vacancy of one year, exercised the episcopal func∣tion for Lindisfarne, until the consecration of Eadbert. In a short time after∣wards, he was restored to the See of York. He had no sooner re-assumed this dignity, than his ungovernable ambition and arrogance blazed out a-new. The See of York, at his first assumption of the episcopal dignity, held in unity the kingdom of Northumberland: At his restoration, it stood dismembered. He made injudicious pretensions and claims to effect a re-union of Hexham and Lin∣disfarne, so as that the whole ecclesiastical jurisdiction might be comprised in the church of York; which so exaspreated the king, and was a thing so inconsistent with the politics of the times, that he was again expelled, and obliged to fly the realm. Collier, from the authority of Eddius, ch. 43. and 44. says, The grounds of this rupture were, <Q>because the king had secularized part of the revenues of “St Peter's church of York, dissolved the monastic institution of Hexham, and taken away the privileges granted by the crown, and confirmed by Pope Aga∣tho: And, lastly, that the king would compel Wilfrid to be subject to the or∣ders and injunctions of Theodore. Wilfrid refusing to comply with such au∣thority, ”and insisting on restitution in the other matters, was banished.</Q> EADBERT was consecrated bishop of Lindisfarne in 688. He was a learned man, of ex∣emplary life and piety, and a most humane and charitable disposition.</P>
<P>In the year 690, Theodore departed this life at the age of eighty-eight. Amongst the many laudable works he accomplished, two are of chief consequence to poste∣rity. He was a great encourager of learning, and liberal education, for which purpose he established public schools, and collected from abroad a very valuable library, both of Greek and Latin authors, some of the manuscripts remaining to this day<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Antiq. Brit. in Theodore, p. 53.</NOTE>. Whitlock in his notes upon Bede, reports, from the Codex Can∣tauriensis, in manuscript, that Theodore made a great improvement in the Eng∣lish churches, set the distinctions of parishes on foot, and brought them forward towards the present form. Bede, as Dr Stillingsleet observes, mentions the pro∣gress of this design in several places, as also do the Saxon councils<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Stillingfleet's Eccl. Cases.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The laws of Ina, king of the West-Saxons, are supposed to have taken place about the year 690; the fourth section of which is to the following purport:
<PB N="28" REF="73"/><Q>“The first fruits of seeds, or the church-dues arising from the product of corn; &amp;c. are to be paid at the feast of St Martin; and let him that sails in the pay∣ment ”forfeit 40 <ABBR>s.</ABBR><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Saxon shilling consisted of five pence sterling.</NOTE>;</Q> as Lambert reads it; or 60 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> according to Sir Henry Spelman<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lambert Archionom. p. 2. Spelman Concil. vol. i. p. 127.</NOTE>; and, besides, pay the dues twelve times over: And, in section 62 <ABBR>d</ABBR>, <Q>“Church-dues are to be paid where the person owing them dwells, in the midst ”of winter.</Q> These laws are mentioned, as they appear to be the first on re∣cord touching such kind of maintenance for the church. The oblations and gifts of the people, which first arose in benevolence, as acts of piety, were grown, by usage and custom, into a right, and now advanced into the firmer title of or∣dinance. It is from thence that modern lawyers say, that tythes are due of com∣mon right, as having existed from the first establishment of churches, and made regular from the division of parochial limits. To return to Wilfrid:—</P>
<P>In his second banishment, he sought refuge in the court of Mercia, where he won upon the ear of Etheldred, and gained from him the bishopric of Leicester. Adversity is said to be the school of wisdom, but it did not prove so to Wilfrid; for, in his new station, he conducted himself with such insolence and impropriety, that he incurred the displeasure of the Mercian king and the archbishop of Can∣terbury, who brought him to judgment before a synod.</P>
<P>The design of convening this assembly, it is thought, was to persuade Wilfrid<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Collier's Antiq. Britain—Eddius.</NOTE> to resign his bishopric; and, if they could not prevail upon him, the next point was to get him condemned by a majority of the bishops, that so the odium of expel∣ling him from the metropolitan See might be taken off from the king. In Wilfrid's defence, he reproached the Synod with open opposition to the authority of the See of Rome, for two and twenty years together. The first sentence this Synod pronoun∣ced against him, and which was agreed to by the king and the archbishop, was, <HI>That he should be disseized of all his revenues, both in the kingdoms of the Northum∣brians and Mercians.</HI> The severity of this judgment startled some of the most ten∣der consciences, and, after a remonstrance, it was so far mitigated, that Wilfrid should possess his monastery of Ripon, if he would bind himself not to go out of its precincts without the king's leave, nor execute any part of the episcopal function. Wilfrid exclaimed vehemently against these proceedings, and declared his resolution to appeal to Rome for redress. He was now 70 years of age, and yet his powers were so little debilitated, and his passions continued so warm, that he again journeyed to Rome, where, in spite of the character of a turbulent and contentious prelate, which he carried along with him, he obtained a decree for his restoration. Returning a second time with the papal mandate, and at a more propitious season to obtain the reward of his labour, the archbishop found it con∣venient to acquiesce; for the Mercian king had assumed the habit of a monk; and the king of Northumberland, under the attacks of a dangerous disease, feel∣ing compunctions for the sufferings of Wilfrid, was reconciled to him.</P>
<P>During this time, Eadbert, with a soul full of benevolence, discovering that the exaction of the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, (church-dues or tythes, as the word is variously con∣strued),
<PB N="29" REF="74"/>from the lower classes of people, was become a grievance, made it a ge∣neral rule to restore them to the poor. He began, and lived to complete, the ca∣thedral of Lindisfarne, which he built of stone, and covered with lead, the re∣mains of which are still standing, as represented in the annexed plate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The cathedral is in the form of a cross, the east and west limbs of which are yet standing, the other parts totally in ruins, and almost level with the ground. The order of building in this structure is rude and heavy, and most of it in the worst mode of the early Saxon architecture. Mr Grose says, "Probably it was the work of different periods; great part of it seems very ancient, the arches being circular, and the columns very massy, and much like those at Durham, but richer. On the north and south walls there are pointed arches, which proves, that part of it at least was built since the reign of Henry II. The de∣struction made by the Danes occasioned much of this variety to take place. The pillars on which the arches rise in the centre of the cross, are clustered, and plain capitalled, being the corner supporters of the great tower. These arches are of few members. The chancel seems to be of more modern architecture, with painted windows, and no side ailes, and perhaps took date, as Mr Grose observes, after the reign of King Henry II. when this church became a cell of monks, subordinate to Durham. The nave of the church con∣sists of a wide centre, and two side ailes, the columns of which are heavy, and the arches circular. In the superstructure of the north and south walls, pointed arches appear. The windows are narrow, ornamented with a corner pilaster, and a moulding of few members. The walls are very thick, and every part wears a gloomy countenance. The south wall of the middle tower is standing, about fisty feet high; and one corner tower, on the west end of the church, remains perfect. These ruins still retain one most singular beauty: Under the tower was a fine canopy arch, a vault or dome, with ribs or bows springing from the angles, and crossing each other diagonally. One of the arches yet stands, unloaded with any superstruc∣ture, supported by the south-east and north-west corner pillars, and ornamented with the dancette or zig∣zag moulding, much used in the old Saxon architecture, stretching a fine bow over the chasm and ruins oc∣casioned by the falling in of the ailes. The chief parts of the structure are composed of a soft red free∣stone, which yields much to time, and renders the aspect of the building dark and melancholy. Mr Grose's account comprehends the following particulars:—"Various fragments of the offices of this monastery are still standing, and foundations of buildings are seattered over a close of near four acres. The main walls of the church, on the north and south sides, are still standing, though much out of the perpendicular, in∣clining outwards so considerably, as to make the horizontal distance between them at the top exceed, by near two feet, that at the bottom. Another winter or two seems to be the utmost they can stand. This building consists of a body and two side ailes, into which it is divided by a double row of very solid co∣lumns, whose shafts are richly ornamented. Each row has five columns, of four different constructions, and two pilasters in the walls on the east and west ends;" (this he speaks of the nave). "The shafts of these columns are about twelve feet high, their diameters about five: Their capitals and pedestals are plain; they support circular arches, having over each arch two ranges of windows; the lowest, large, and in pairs, separated only by a short column; the upper, small and single. The length of the building is about 138 feet, the breadth of the body 18 feet, and that of the two side ailes, about 9 feet each."
<P>The prospect from this island is beautiful: To the northward you command the town of Berwick, over an arm of the sea, about seven miles in breadth. At near the same distance, to the fouth, you view Bam∣brough Castle, on a bold promontory. On the one hand you have a view of the open sea, at the time of our observation, calm and resplendent, scattered over with vessels; and, on the other hand, a narrow channel, by which this land is insulated, about two miles in width. The distant shore exhibits a beautiful hanging landscape of cultivated country, graced with a multitude of hamlets, villages, and woodlands.— For a particular account of this place, see the Author's View of Northumberland, vol. ii. p. 3.</P></NOTE>. After having finished this pious work, he caused the body of St Cuthbert to be re∣moved into a magnificent tomb, prepared for it, on the right side of the high altar. On this occasion the authorities state, that the body was found perfect and uncorrupted, as if still living, the limbs flexible, and the whole appearance more like one that slept than one that was dead; the vestments in which the corps had been interred, remaining clean and whole. The new sepulchre was elevated above the pavement of the church, for better observation, and greater reve∣rence<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Wharton's Angl.

<PB N="30" REF="75"/>
<P>After having executed this great work, and held the See ten years, Eadbert de∣parted this life in the year 698, and was interred in the spot where St Cuthbert's remains had been first deposited<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 370.—Symeon Dunelm. p. 59.—Bede.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EADFRID, or, agreeable to some authors, Egfridth, was the next who possessed the See, a monk of Lindisfarne, and one of the most learned men of his time. He trans∣lated the Gospels into Latin; which work, after his death, was highly decorated by his successor, with gold and jewels. Bilfrid, an hermit, illuminated it with various paintings, and rich devices; and Adred, a priest, interlined it with a Sax∣on version. This curious work is now deposited in the British Museum, in the Cottonian Collection<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Quatuor Evangelia Lat. ex versione Hieron. cum interlineari Saxonica, &amp;c. Idem Codex est is de quo tot miracula narrantur in Chronicis et Annalibus Dunelm. Ecelesiae.—Nero, d. iv.—See a curious speci∣men of this book in Strut's Chroniele.</NOTE>. Under this learned prelate's patronage, the venerable Bede wrote the life of St Cuthbert. Bede undertook to remonstrate to the bishop on his neglect of the duties of his high office; for though he had, soon after his co∣ming to the See, through his veneration for the memory of St Cuthbert, repaired and beautified his little oratory on Farne, yet he did not follow so closely his ex∣emplary life, as Bede conceived he ought to have done, for the honour of reli∣gion; whereupon he took upon him to dictate to the prelate. The epistle wrote on this occasion was said to be the means of Eadfrid's attending more strictly to his studies; and from that time he translated a great part of the Gospels into the Saxon language, for an easier communication to the people. Bede's maxims were well adapted to the age, and are still not uninstructive to prelates of more modern and learned times. The subjects of his expostulation were chiefly the importance of a bishop's duty, and the greatness of the charge which he had assumed. He entreated him to recognise the divine commission, as being the ordination of the great missionary of Heaven; that he should rebuke the proud in the vanity of their high station, and instruct them in the duties of humiliation; that they should not erect churches for the sake of popular admiration and worldly honour, but as works of piety only, for the propagation of religion and virtue; that he should visit his clergy, and reprove, or lop off, those branches which were contaminated with the vices of the age; and that his leisure hours should be appropriated to acts of devotion and study, and not sacrificed to pleasures, luxuries, and useless ease<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Angl. Sacra—Lel. Col. v.i. p. 328. 370.—Symeon Dunelm. p. 60.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>During Eadfrid's episcopacy, King Alcfrid departed this life, in the year 705. In his youth he married Kenburg, the daughter of Peada the Mercian, and had issue by her one son,
<PB N="31" REF="76"/>OSRED, an infant of eight years of age, under the guardianship of a powerful lord, na∣med Brithric.</P>
<P>Eadulph, a lord of the country, taking advantage of Osred's youth, made an attempt to usurp the throne, assisted by a powerful party, who proclaimed him king. This obliged Osred and his guardian to shut themselves up in Bambrough Castle, where the unskilful usurper immediately besieged them; and, instead of marching through the country, seizing the strong-holds, and receiving allegiance from the people, he wasted his time in a fruitless attempt to take this impregnable fortress, which gave the king's friends an opportunity to recover from their sur∣prise, and a means of levying troops for the defence of their lawful sovereign. It was not long before Eadulph discovered his party was weakened, the populace were deserting him, and his cause more perilous than he at first conceived. Troops were marching from every quarter to surround him, and all his safety seemed to depend on raising the siege. Sudden and hasty measures are attended with confu∣sion; Brithric, observing what was doing in the besieger's lines, and before Ea∣dulph could escape, made a successful sally, took the usurper prisoner, and im∣mediately struck off his head before the walls of Bambrough<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">G. Malms.—Sax. Ann.—Bede —Flor. Wigo.—Rapin.—Godwin.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>During this short usurpation, Wilfrid, not doubting of Eadulph's success, very impolitically repaired to him, in hopes of securing his friendship and protection. But Eadulph knowing him to be hated by the Northumbrians, and willing to do them a pleasure, gave him a very ill reception, forbidding him ever to appear again in his presence. Brithric did not remain uninformed of Wilfrid's conduct, and despised him for it<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Eddius—Rapin-Angl. Sacra.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As soon as the rebellion was suppressed, and Ofred's throne secured, Berth∣wald, archbishop of Canterbury, became Wilfrid's advocate, and prevailed with the king to assemble a council, near the river Nid, to deliberate on this prelate's extraordinary case. The king was attended by three northern bishops, and seve∣ral abbots: The abbess Elfleda, the deceased king Alcfrid's sister, was also pre∣sent. The abbess declared, that her royal brother, on his death-bed, had promi∣sed to stand by the decree of the apostolic See; and, in case of his death, he charged his successor with the performance. Brithric was also present, and, ha∣ving forgot his resentment against Wilfrid, for the love of truth and justice, said, that when they were hard pressed during the siege of Bambrough, they made a solemn vow of compliance. On which the bishops agreed to the following accom∣modation: That John of Beverley, bishop of Hexham, should be removed to York, vacant by the death of Bosa, and that Wilfrid should be put in possession of the bishopric and monastery of Hexham, together with the abbey of Ripon<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Malms. —Camden—Eddius—Collier—Wharton, &amp;c.</NOTE>.
<PB N="32" REF="77"/>Wilfrid survived this accommodation about four years, when he died at his mo∣nastery of Oundle in Northamptonshire, October 12, 1711, aged 76, having held the episcopal character 45 years.

<P>When the king arrived at manhood, he fell into the most vicious courses of life, and, in the gratification of his lust, committed innumerable outrages<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i. p. 139.</NOTE>. Dis∣regarding all ranks of religious men, he held the preaching fathers in the utmost contempt, which, in that age, was esteemed one of the greatest acts of impiety. Despising all restraint, his brutal habits knew no bounds; the defilement of the marriage bed, the violation of women of all ranks, even of nuns, and the pol∣lution of the most sacred places, were his ordinary offences. After Alcfrid, Os∣wey's natural son, came to the crown, all the bastards of the king's or their de∣scendents imagined they had the same right to aspire to the throne. This proved the occasion of a multitude of troubles. Cenred and Osric, descendents of Ogga, natural son of Ida, seeing the king was detested, formed a party against him. The conspiracy was abetted by the clergy of all ranks, who, for the general cause of religion, and particularly their own safety and peace, were anxious to depose this outrageous violator of all laws. An open revolt soon took place. Inflamed with the cry of religion, the populace, with a burning zeal, took up arms; and Osred, obliged to try the event of battle, was slain, in the eleventh year of his reign<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Hen. Huntingd.—Lel. Col. v.</NOTE>. He married Cuthburga, sister to Ina, king of the West-Saxons, who,

<P>OSRIC, on the demise of Cenred, seized the sceptre in the year 718; but what were the events of the nine, some say eleven, years of his reign, no historian hath men∣tioned.

<P>Our pious bishop was a spectator of these convulsions of state; but whether he was engaged in abetting the conspiracy, by which the wicked Osred fell, histo∣rians have not said: Neither is it matter for surprise, that the pens of ecclesiastics should refuse to hand down to posterity, any relation that might impeach the character of our venerable prelate. Eadfrid, having held the See twenty-four years, departed this life A. D. 721, and was buried at Lindisfarne.</P>
<P>During the reign of Osric, ETHELWOLD, abbot of Melros, an intimate friend of St Cuthbert, succeeded to this bishopric, A. D. 724. He caused a ponderous cross of stone to be made and erected in the ground adjoining the church, which was inscribed with his name, and other memorials. The socket, or foot-stone, in which it was mortised, still lies a few paces to the east of the ruined church<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Now called the Petting Stone.

It has been asserted to have been the first erected in the diocese; but has been already noti∣ced, that St Oswald set up one in the front of his army, before his signal victory over Cedwell; and in the discourse which, according to Symeon, St Cuthbert held with his brethren, in his dying moments, his request was to be buried near a cross which he himself had erected<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Cum Deus susceperit animam meam, sepelite me in hac mansione, juxta oratorium meum ad meridiem contra orientalem plagam sanctae crucis quam ibidem erexi.—Symeon Dun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lm, p. 51.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>There appears to have been a vacancy in the See for three years before the consecration of our bishop; but writers assign no cause for it, and indeed they are silent as to the transactions of many years during the reigns of Osric and Cenred.</P>
<P>Rapin says, Osric on his demise left his crown to his cousin Ceolwlph; but the fact seems to be, that, by the election of the people, CEOLWLPH ascended the throne in the year 730. He was a lineal descendent of Ida, from Ogga, his eldest illegitimate son. At this time the kingdom of Northumber∣land was undisturbed by the northern nations. The Picts had entered into a treaty with the English, and those clans of Scots who dwelt in Britain, kept quiet within their own frontiers, and attempted nothing upon the Northumbrians<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Symeon Dunelm. p. 63.</NOTE>. As for the Britons, they refused all friendly correspondence, hated the English up∣on the score of the old quarrel, and refused to conform to the Romish usage of keeping Easter. Bede says, <Q>Now all war and tumult ceasing, and unity and “concord universally prevailing, many of Northumberland, as well of the nobi∣lity as lower classes, laying aside the use of arms, became, both they and their ”sons, religious men.</Q> The king was a pious man, and spent his days in de∣vout exercises: The reins of government were relaxed; a religious enthusiasm possessed the people; and that abstracted indolence took place, in which neither arts or sciences, cultivation of land, or manufactories, advanced. The common∣wealth must always suffer under an over-heated zeal, and enthusiastic religion. The king being ever at his devotions, the nobles catched the infatuation, and con∣ceiving self-denial, mortification, and neglect of worldly concerns, most accept∣able to Heaven, they founded religious houses, built churches, and took on them the monastic habits. Those who should have appeared in the several depart∣ments of government, were sunk into cells, and the state lost its necessary sup∣ports. The enthusiasm also extended to the lower classes. Bede seems to have had a prophetic spirit of the evil consequences which would ensue; but it was not suited to his station, to pronounce against an error on which the power and grow∣ing wealth of religious houses depended. He saw, however, that monasteries, unless their numbers and conduct were attended to by the legislature, would prove an injury both to church and state. This appears by his letter to Egbert, bishop of York, written some few years after his ecclesiastical history. After shewing the necessity there was for encreasing episcopal Sees, he says, <Q>There are “”monasteries enough that ought to spare part of their estates for such uses;</Q> and th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r fore, <Q>he thought it reasonable some of their lands should be taken from “them, and laid to the bishopric; especially as many of them sell short of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of their institution: And since it was commonly said, that several of tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e places were not serviceable to God or the commonwealth, because nei∣ther <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e exercises of piety and discipline were practised, nor the estates possessed
<PB N="35" REF="80"/>by men in a condition to defend their country: Therefore, if those houses were some of them turned into bishoprics, it would be a seasonable provision ”for the church, and prove a very commendable alteration.</Q> He intreats Eg∣bert <Q>to use his interest with king Ceolwlph to reverse the charters of former “kings, for the purposes above mentioned, as it had sometimes happened the piety of princes was over lavish, and directed amiss." He complains farther, That the monasteries were frequently filled with people of unsuitable practices; that the country seemed overstocked with those foundations; that there were scarce estates enow left for the laity of condition; and that if this humour in∣creased, the country would become unfurnished of troops to defend their fron∣tiers." He adds, "That several persons of quality amongst the laity, who had neither choice or experience of a monastic life, used to purchase crown-lands, under pretence of founding a monastery, and then obtain a charter of privi∣leges, signed by the king, the bishops, and other great men in church and state; by these expedients working together a great estate, and making them∣selves lords of several villages; and thus getting themselves discharged from the services of the common-wealth, they retired for liberty and ease, took the range of their fancy, assumed the character of abbots, and governed a race of monks, without any just pretence to such authority: And, what was still more irregular, they, in some instances, had not stocked those places with persons properly denominated by the title of religious, but raked together a society of strolling monks, expelled other convents for their misbehaviour; and, in other instances, they had persuaded their own retinue to take the tonsure and promise a monastic obedience: And, having furnished their religious houses with such ill-chosen company, they lived a life perfectly secular, under a monastic cha∣racter; bringing their wives into the monasteries, and were husbands and ab∣bots at the same time. That, for about thirty years after the death of king Alcfrid, the country had run riot in this manner; insomuch, that there were very few of the lord-lieutenants, or governors of towns, who had not seized the religious jurisdiction of some monastery, and put their ladies in the same predicament of guilt, by making them abbesses, without passing through the stages of discipline and retirement that ought to qualify them for it. And, as ill customs are apt to spread, the king's menial servants had taken up the same fashion. And thus we find a great many inconsistent offices and titles became incorporated. The same persons were abbots and ministers of state; and the ”court and cloister were unsuitably tacked together.</Q> To stop the growth of this disorder, Bede advises <Q>the convening of a synod; that a visitation might “”be begun, and all such unqualified persons thrown out of the usurpation.</Q> He reminds the bishop, <Q>That it is part of the episcopal office to inspect the “monasteries of his diocese; to reform whatever is erroneous, both in the prin∣cipals and inferiors, and not to suffer a breach of the rules of the institution. It is your province," says he, "to take care that the devil gains no ascendency in places consecrated to God; that we may not have discord instead of tran∣quillity; and libertinism for sobriety." Collier observes, "The satire and de∣clamation
<PB N="36" REF="81"/>in this epistle, shews the pious zeal and integrity of the author; who, notwithstanding he was bred a monk, wrote this letter in a monastery, and had so great a veneration for the institution, yet was so impartial as not ”to dissemble the miscarriages crept into the state<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bede—Ep. ad Egbert, p. 261.263.—Collier.—Bede wrote the above letter in the year 735 or 736, in which latter he died. He was much indisposed, when he wrote it, and never recovered, or he would have visited the bishop to enforce his request.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The reader will pardon this digression, as it has such pointed reference to se∣veral of those religious institutions, to which, in the course of this work, parti∣cular attention must be given. This letter also shews, it was an establishment of the earliest church, that the discipline and reformation of monasteries belonged not to the secular jurisdiction, but to the bishop of the diocese only, unless the monks were guilty of a crime against the state.</P>
<P>About this time the Saxons were grown so intolerably licentious, giving them∣selves up to luxury and intemperance, that they were the objects of the most severe spiritual reprehension. It seems their dissolute manners were such, as ren∣dered them contemptible in foreign countries. Boniface, archbishop of Mentz, wrote a letter of remonstrance to this country, charging one of the Saxon sove∣reigns with want of sobriety, and a total relaxation of virtuous conduct; that he lived unmarried, and in a state of incontinence, having transgressed all religious principles so far as to be guilty of ravishing the nuns; from which pernicious ex∣ample, society was injured, and the name of Christianity brought into reproach. The Heathens, he observed, restrained themselves from such heinous offences, and regarded the marriage-vow with the most sacred reverence. Amongst the old Saxons, if a maid lost her virtue, and dishonoured her family, or a married wo∣man was convicted of adultery, they forced them to be their own executioners, and strangle themselves, to wipe out the disgrace and ignominy; and, as an hor∣rid example, their bodies were burnt to ashes; and the man who seduced them was hung over the smoaking remains. From such pernicious examples as pre∣vailed at the time of this pious prelate's letter, he avowed that vice would grow into enormity, and become an entail on future ages; that posterity would catch the infection, and wickedness grow universal, by which the people would be sunk to the last degree of depravity and wretchedness; devoid of conscience, honour, and courage, they would become traitors at home, and cowards in the field, and, in the end, despicable to God and man; a striking example of which was then exhibited in the Spaniards and Burgundians. Such was the spirit of this pious remonstrance.</P>
<P>The depravity censured by the good bishop did not escape the female sex; for, in Boniface's letter to Cuthbert, archbishop of Canterbury, there is an ac∣count of the dissolute life of some of the women of this age, <Q>who used to “travel upon pretence of religion, and go in pilgrimage to Rome: To prevent which, he insisted the church and state ought to forbid all women that had taken the veil from strolling into foreign countries; averring that the greatest part of these travellers made a miserable voyage, and left their honour in
<PB N="37" REF="82"/>their pilgrimage; there being few cities, either in Lombardy or France, in which some of those English prostitutes were not to be met with; which is a ”shame and scandal,</Q> says he, "to your whole church<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Boniface's letters.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>So much it was necessary to observe, from these great authorities in church-history, at this period, when it appears the infatuation for religious profession prevailed so greatly with both sexes in Northumberland. But to return to Ceo∣lwlph.</P>
<P>Ethelbald, the king of Mercia, observing the unhappy condition of the neigh∣bouring empire, determined to make his advantage of it, and with a powerful army entered Northumberland. He ravaged the borders, sacked and laid waste their cities, and, loaden with spoils, returned in triumph; whilst the Northum∣brians, as idle spectators, disregarded the wreck of empire; many of them, be∣ing infatuated zealots, received their afflictions as the discipline and scourge of Heaven, esteeming them salutary mortifications, wherein they should find spiri∣tual comfort. Anarchy and confusion took place, and the state was hastening to dissolution, when the king, in a phrenzy of zeal, after having reigned eight years, abdicated the throne, and offered his crown at the high altar in the church of Lindisfarne, where he assumed the cowl in 738<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bede—Malmf.— Symeon—&amp;c.</NOTE>. Before his abdi∣cation, he granted an exemption and immunity, to all the churches and religious houses within his realm, from all public taxes, works, and burdens, except only the building of castles and bridges<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Malmf.—Lel. Col. v. i. p. 140.</NOTE>. He brought great revenues to the church, and granted in perpetuity a large territory of land, the express boundaries of which some of the monastic writers have preserved; but, from the changes of names, and the destruction even of cities, specified therein, the line cannot now be ascertained. They are thus mentioned; <Q>Brainshaw and Warkworth, with the “church which he had built there: Also four villas, called Wudcester, Hwit∣ingham, ”Eadulsingham, and Egwulsingham<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i. p. 328.—Sym<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on Dunelm. p. 79.</NOTE>.</Q> Of the before-mentioned gift, the following are the bounds: <HI>Ab aqua vocatur Luia, usq ad Cocwuda, &amp; inde usque at civitatem que vocatur Brincewell, &amp; a Cocwuda usque ad Hafodscelfe versus orientem, &amp; ab Alna usque ad dimidiam viam inter Cocwuda &amp; Alna</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Lel. I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in. v. vi. p. 35.</NOTE>. If this royal monk carried with him riches to the monastery, he also carried innovations to that strict discipline for which it had been famed from its foundation, and which, once relaxed, gave pretence for others of a more dangerous nature. We are told he procured an improvement in the living of the monks, gaining the use of ale and wine, in the room of water and milk, which were the only li∣quors they were permitted to have, under the rules instituted by Aidan, their founder<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Hove∣den—Bede—Con.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Not having any issue, Ceolwlph is said to have bequeathed his sceptre to his cousin-german Edbert, the son of Eata, who succeeded him. Entering into a spiritual life might at that time have been esteemed an extinction of temporal rights. But by what authority a Saxon king could dispose of his kingdom, is not easy to ascertain.</P>
<PB N="38" REF="83"/>
<P>EDBERT ascended the throne in 737, when the realm was in the most relaxed and impo∣tent state: All the neighbouring powers were committing continual depreda∣tions on his subjects, who, like men of disturbed reason, bowed their simple heads to every affliction, and put their hands in their bosoms, void of self-de∣fence, the tributary states declaring for freedom and independence. His coro∣nation was immediately followed by an invasion of the Picts on the northern fron∣tiers. Obliged to march with all possible expedition to oppose them, the Mer∣cians took advantage of the circumstance, entered the southern parts of Northum∣berland, and carried off a large booty.</P>
<P>How difficult a task it was to rouse the lethargic zealots from their fascination, and drive them to arms, may easily be conceived. At length Edbert disciplined and led forth a powerful army, and, with great military prowess, brought the malcontents to their duty, subdued the Picts and Britons who were in arms, and beat back the Mercians<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Malms. l. i. c. 3.—Hen. Hunt. l. iv.—Rapin, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>Our bishop, of whom we have few memorials, departed this life at Lindis∣farne, in the year 740, and was succeeded by CYNEWOLF, who was elected the same year.</P>
<P>Two year after his consecration, the royal monk Ceolwlph departed this life at Lindisfarne. He was interred there, but afterwards his remains were remo∣ved to Norham; and, finally, his head rested in the same cenotaph with St Cuth∣bert at Durham<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hoveden—Lel. Col. v. iii. ii. p. 371.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>About the time that Cynewolf was consecrated to this episcopacy, Acca, bishop of Hexham, died; a man spoken of by historians with great veneration, for his piety and godly works<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Our prelate suffered great distresses during his episcopacy; at first, by falling under the king's displeasure; and afterwards, by the distraction of the state. Edbert accused him of being accessary to the death of Offa, a person of the royal line, who took refuge in the church of Lindisfarne<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 371.—Symeon Dunelm. p. 81. 82.</NOTE>. Some authors say, his re∣fusing to deliver up the assassin, gave the suspicion of his being privy to the crime. The bishop was imprisoned at Bebbanburg, where he remained in close durance a considerable time before he made his peace with the king, and was restored. Higbald, bishop of Hexham, officiated in the See of Lindisfarne during Cyne∣wolf's captivity.</P>
<P>Two things are remarkable in this event; the first, that of Offa's taking re∣fuge at the tomb of St Cuthbert. This is the first instance of sanctuary we meet with in the history of this church; and we do not find that it was a privilege
<PB N="39" REF="84"/>granted by any sovereign, but merely arose from the sanctity and veneration in which the saint's remains were held. The privilege of sanctuary has been ex∣claimed against with great virulence, as being an extension of ecclesiastical juris∣diction inconsistent with true policy. It had good consequences in those days, as it allowed the criminal time for making restitution, or, under the Saxon laws, he must have suffered immediate pains and punishments: It was the process by which the rigour of common law was moderated, and, when kept in due restraint, was of great benefit to mankind: But, by an enormous extension which took place, it produced infinite mischiefs to the community.</P>
<P>The other remarkable matter was, the imprisonment of a bishop, and the ex∣ertion of regal power therein against the church, without a convention.</P>
<P>Edbert, in the 18th year of his reign, entered into a league with the King of the Picts, and, with their united forces, they laid siege to the city of Alcluyth, afterwards called Dunbarton, which, in Alcfrid's reign, had been wrested from the realm by the Welch. On the 1st of August, the Britons, who held the place, unable to oppose such powerful assailants, surrendered it; and Deovania, who headed a Welch reinforcement, which was coming up to relieve the garrison, was intercepted, and the greatest part of his troops put to the sword. Edbert was a prince of eminent talents, and high reputation. Pepin, king of France, his co∣temporary, is said to have kept up a correspondence with him, and cultivated his friendship by many royal presents. In the twenty-first year of his reign, when he had restored peace to his kingdom, when his days were full of honour,—when his fame had passed abroad through many nations,—at a time he possessed his people's highest veneration and love, and his crown was adorned with the brightest gems of virtue and illustrious actions, he was seized with the religious infatuation of the age, abdicated the throne, and retired to a monastery in York, leaving his sceptre to his son. In this retreat he lived ten years, enjoying, until the time of his death, the daily intercourse and spiritual converse of Egbert his bro∣ther, bishop of York, who departed this life some short time after the royal re∣cluse. Edbert was interred in the cathedral church, and in the same porch the pious bishop was also buried<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Egbert, being a prelate of an exalted mind, suited to his high birth, obtained from Rome the archie∣piscopal pall, A.

<P>OSWULF, Edbert's only son, ascended the throne in the year 759, upon his father's abdica∣tion. He did not reign one year, being slain by a domestic at a place called. Micklewoughton. From the authority of the Scala Chronica, it appears he died by the procurement of his mother. The reason for this unhappy exit is not no∣ticed by historians. On this satal event,
<PB N="40" REF="85"/>MOLLO-ETHELWALD seized the sceptre, a man of noble birth, but not of the royal line. His accession was the occasion of a melancholy series of calamities to Northumberland, and proved in the end the destruction of the kingdom. A person not of the royal lineage being supported on the throne, was a precedent for all the great men to aspire to the government, as they adopted an idea, they were as well entitled to the crown, from natural right, as the princes of the blood, the sovereignty being elective in the people. Hence arose those factions that ended at last in the entire loss of the public liberty; and from such examples was at length deduced the salu∣tary maxim of the crown's passing in descent, reserving in the people the power of deposing a vicious prince. Some of the nobles who were not of Mollo's interest, as he assumed the diadem by means of a powerful party, thought it allowable for them to make the like attempt. Oswin headed a dangerous faction; he was of noble birth, but not descended of kings; and possessing the affections of some par∣tizans, who were discontent with Mollo's reign, took the field. This insurrec∣tion obliged Mollo, with all expedition, to levy an army, and a decisive battle was soon after fought at a place called Edwin's-clive. Other authors say it was at Eldune, near Melros<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are many lines on the Eldune, or Helton Hills, as they are vulgarly called, and a fortified camp on the crown of one of them. Eldune is the name of a village, and of the three remarkable hills just above it, to the west. Eldun, Aldyn, Hieldun, Halydon, Yeldun, all mean the same village, or the hills hard by it; the latter giving name to the village, rather than the village giving name to the hills. Symeon does not speak of Eldun as being then without the bounds of the Northumbrian kingdom. The Melros Chro∣nicle places this victory in 760, and says that Unust, king of the Picts, died the same year.</NOTE>, in which Oswin was slain, and his troops routed. Af∣ter this event, Mollo reigned for some time in peace, till he fell by assassination. Alured, or Alcred, a nobleman of great power, descended, in the fifth degree, from Ida, by Alaric, one of his natural sons, highly dissatisfied with Mollo's being raised to the throne, in preference of the royal line, determined to put him to death, as the means of opening his own passage to royalty, to which he aspired in right of his ancestors.</P>
<P>Mollo-Ethelwald was slain in the year 770, leaving one son, Ethelred; but he was succeeded by ALURED, OR ALCRED, who, for about ten years, sat uneasily on a throne purchased by blood. Mollo's party were struck with a panic on his death, and, for some time, sat still under this new usurpation; but at length, the spirit of faction reviving, and their party increasing, the realm was ripe for revolt, and nothing but arms became the cry of the people; when Alured, deserted by his partizans, whom in so distracted a state he could not serve, or even protect, to avoid a threatening death, during the festival of Easter, abandoned York, and for a while shut himself up in the
<PB N="41" REF="86"/>fortress of Bebbanburg, and afterwards fled for protection to the king of the Picts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A. D. 784. Bebbanburg is thus deseribed:—"Bebba vero civitas urbs est munitissima, non admodum magna, sed quasi duorum vel trium agrorum spatium habens unum introitum cavatum, &amp; gradibus miro modo exaltatum.

Hoveduni.</NOTE>.—On this desertion, Mollo's party placed his son ETHELRED on the throne. A multitude of factions rent the state, even from the hour of his accession, either from the interests of those of royal descent, ambitious nobles, anxious for royalty, or from the morose disposition Ethelred displayed in his first maxims of government. Perhaps all these operated to stir up the succeeding re∣bellions. Rapin says of Ethelred, that he judged the best way to six himself on the throne, was by the death or banishment of the heads of the contrary party. Accordingly, three of the principal opposers of his election were put to death, for forged or slight crimes. But this method, instead of having the expected effect, served only to hasten on the plots of his enemies, whom the death of three in∣nocent lords<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Adwulf, Kinwulf, Eccn.</NOTE> served as a pretext for taking up arms. The king, sending his best troops against them, under the command of a general entirely devoted to his service, hoped he should speedily reduce them to obedience. But his army was overthrown by the malcontents, at a place called King's-Cliff, and his general slain. In a second engagement, at a place called Holy Thorn, his troops were overcome and dispersed. This threw the king into such a perilous situation, that he thought it expedient to save himself by flight, and seek refuge in some of the neighbouring state.</P>

<P>Osulf being king, Pope Adrian sent Gregory bishop of Ostia, and Theophilact bishop of Todi, as legates to assist at the synod of Calcuith, as Sir Henry Spel∣man says, A. D. 787. One of the legates travelled into the kingdom of Nor∣thumberland, and was present at a meeting of all the great men of that territory, both clergy and laity, when certain orders were agreed to for the discipline and reformation of manners. The laws of each age point out the vices which then prevailed, by the restriction they provided. The third order enjoins the bishop, in his visitation, to pronounce the censure of excommunication against all persons accused of incest, divination, witchcraft, and sacrilege. The tenth forbids the clergy to perform divine service without stockings; and that the chalice and pat∣ten be not made of horn. This gives us but a mean idea of church magnificence in that age. The twelfth declares against admitting persons of illegitimate birth to the crown; urges submission and obedience to rulers; and, with great spiri∣tual detestation, pronounces against conspiracies, rebellion, and acts of violence, against the king. The thirteenth charges ministers of justice to act uprightly, and not to take reward against the innocent. The fourteenth, to avoid fraud, violence, and laying unjust impositions upon the church. By the sixteenth, illegitimate is∣sue, and particularly the children of nuns, are made incapable of inheriting. The seventeenth urges the payment of tithes, from the Mosaic law, and the doc∣trine of the Old Testament; and observes, that those who refuse to offer the tenth part to God Almighty, are often times reduced to poverty. By the nine∣teenth, all Heathenish customs are to be abolished; particularly, the people are forbidden to deform their bodies by any superstitious marks or scars, after the Pagan manner. These canons were first read in the Northumbrian synod, where, after they had been subscribed to by the king, the bishops, temporal nobility, and inferior clergy of that province, they were brought by the legates to the synod, where, Calcuith, and there ratisied by the king, the archbishop of Canterbury, and all parties present<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> —The See did not remain vacant any considerable time, HIGBALD being elected thereto, whose episcopacy was attended with various troubles and calamities, not only from an unsettled state, but from foreign soes.

So un∣happy were the consequences of removing the diadem from the royal line, and
<PB N="43" REF="88"/>its being disposed of to the nobility, that faction was cherished in the hearts of most of the Northumbrians from the time those unpropitious changes took place. New and various interests arose among the people, and ambitious projects sired the mind of every nobleman, who possessed any degree of popularity; so that, in every district, whatever prince ruled, some peculiar dissatisfaction breathed, and the spirit of rebellion had its sundry haunts. The nobility pretended they recei∣ved a public affront by the exaltation of the sceptre. The excellencies and virtues of the king were totally disregarded; they aggravated rather than served to con∣ciliate the turbulent minds of the nobility. At length the people appeared in open rebellion, and a conspiracy was formed against the king's life. Alfwold had reigned about ten years, when he was treacherously, slain by a nobleman called Siga, a chief of the conspirators, and one whom he retained about his person. This crime was perpetrated at a place called Scytlecester, or Cilchester, near the wall of Severus, in the month of September, A. D. 788, and the royal remains were interred at Hexham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Symeon Dunelm. p. 85.—Hoveden—Chron. Sax.—H. Hunt. —Rapin, &amp;c.</NOTE>.

<P>It does not appear that any one ascended the throne of Northumberland until the year 791, when the prevailing party placed the crown on the head of OSRED, son of Alured. His reign was short: The same giddy multitude to whom he owed his diadem, deprived him of it in less than a year. He was so unfit to rule, and appeared so contemptible, even in the eyes of his friends, in the affairs of go∣vernment, that the people deposed him, and, as some say, by constraint shaved him for a monk, and thrust him into a monastery at York. Others say he fled to conceal his disgrace, and sought security in some foreign country<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">J. Redbourne —Chron. Sax.—Hoveden.</NOTE>. This de∣position was much attributed to Ethelred's party, who, having become very powerful, effected his restoration, after twelve years exile<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Symeon Duneml. p. 86. —Hen.

<P>ETHELRED, in his malevolent disposition, retained the darkest principles of revenge; and, when he thought himself secure on the throne, began to exercise the utmost se∣verity on those who had appeared against him whilst he formerly held the sceptre, and them, with their adherents, on various pretences, he ensnared and put to death. The sons of Alswold having repaired to York, where they thought them∣selves safe from violence or treachery, were regarded with an eye of jealousy, left, in some future day, they should lay claim to their father's diadem. By an artful address, and promises of employment in the state, he seduced them from their place of security; and, as they travelled northward, procured their assassination,
<PB N="44" REF="89"/>near to Win-wandermere<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Now Winandermere, or Windermere.</NOTE>. His hands were stained with blood, and his heart hardened with iniquity. By a practised policy, and various devices, he ensnared the unfortunate Osred, who, it is said, retired from the monastery into which he had been driven, and became a voluntary exile in some foreign part, Symeon says, in the Isle of Man. Being invited from thence by some of his party, un∣der assurances of support, and afterwards deserted, he was taken by Ethelred un∣der accusation of disturbing the realm, and put to death at a place called Cunburg. Now trusting that every object was removed which could disturb his government, he thought it would strengthen his authority to make an alliance with Ossa king of Mercia. To this end, without any real cause of offence, he divorced his queen, and married Elfled, Ossa's daughter<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hoveden—Leland.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>During Higbald's episcopacy, and in the fifth year of Ethelred's reign, after his restoration, the Danes, and other roving barbarians from the north, made a descent upon the English coast, and entering Lindisfarne, not only seized the cattle, but also destroyed the monastery, pillaged the church, and inhumanly but∣chered many of the inhabitants, among whom were several of the ecclesiastics. The Heathen invaders rejoiced in defiling the sacred things, overturning the al∣tars, and spoiling the hallowed shrines of their relics and ornaments. In the fol∣lowing year, they practised the same acts of cruelty and rapine on the monastery of Jarrow: But vindictive providence soon overtook them; for Ethelred, with the assistance of his father-in-law, Ossa king of Mercia, on this second descent, drove them back with great slaughter, and their leader falling into the hands of the English, was put to torture and a lingering death. A storm arising as the in∣vaders were making sail from Tynemouth, loaded with spoils, dispersed and shat∣tered their fleet, and a great part of it was wrecked.

<P>The Danes, whilst they were making their horrid spoil in the sacred places of Lindisfarne, were ignorant of the chief treasure of the religious body there; the precious remains from whence such future wealth and honour was to be derived, the incorruptible body of St Cuthbert, which slept undisturbed; and to which, af∣ter the enemy had quitted the coast, the bishop, and surviving monks, who fled from the cruelty of the barbarians, returned; and, with religious zeal, they in∣stantly set about to repair the damage the sacred edisices had sustained<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Symeon Dunelm. p. 86.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Ethelred's tyranny and vices were odious, and all his subjects groaned under their oppressions: At length, attempting to send Ardulf, one of the principal lords of he country, into exile, together with the enormity of his other crimes, which called aloud for redress, roused the people, who could no longer support their afflictions: Cabals and insurrections were discovered in every quarter of the kingdom, which at length ripened into a general revolt. The civil war which succeeded having harrassed the country for two years, and not yet promising a speedy issue, the malcontents sound means to have the king assassinated on the 18th day of April, A.

<P>Ardulf possessed the throne, embroiled in civil war, faction and conspiracy. He held it by force of arms, and wielded a sceptre imbrued in blood. Alcred, though dead, left a son, Alchmund, who came forth amidst the troubles of the state to claim his share in the confusion and distresses of the times, at once to re∣venge the disgraces of his father, and stretch forth his hand to gain his diadem. Alchmund, possessed of great popularity, was the head of a faction which threat∣ened to give the king much trouble. Those circumstances induced Ardulf to devise his death, which he got effected, but not without suspicion of the part he had taken in it. By the death of Alchmund the ancient race of Northumbrian kings was totally extinguished: The singular sanctity of his manners, and the treachery by which he fell, occasioned him to be looked upon as a martyr, and ranked among the saints<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Symeon, p. 89.—Lel.

But when the armies were ready to en∣gage, a reconciliation was effected by the interposition of the prelates and nobles of each nation, and a peace concluded, to continue during the lives of the kings.</P>
<P>The death of Alchmund still disturbed the minds of the people: The reflec∣tion, that in him they lost the last remains of the royal lineage, a race of princes under whom their state had its origin, and grew up to honour, aggravated their misfortunes. Their dissatisfaction, at length, broke out into a flame; they took up arms, and set Aldric at their head: But this general being vanquished, and falling in battle, the disconcerted malcontents dispersed themselves, and waited a more favourable opportunity to pursue their vengeance. It was not long before the hour arrived; the party increased rapidly; the murmurs against the king's cruelty prevailed, and contaminated the minds of many, who were originally in his interest, but who now forsook their allegiance.

<P>HEATHURED succeeded to the See, during whose prelacy the great event before mentioned, the accession of Northumberland to the crown of Egbert, took place.</P>
<P>This material revolution claims the reader's attention to a short digression, in or∣der that he may proceed regularly to the time when the crown of Northumber∣land was degraded, and worn by a viceroy.</P>
<P>Egbert, son of Alchmund, descended from Esa, Eoppa, Inigisil, Cemed, who was the fourth from Ceaulin, was become very popular in Wessex, during the reign of Brithric, who, growing jealous of his rising merit, determined to remove him. Egbert, gaining information of the snares laid for him, fled into Mercia, and from thence to France, where he remained twelve years, attending to those studies which might not only polish and adorn his mind, but also accomplish him in the knowledge of the true interests of the nations of Europe, of the interior wealth of states, of civil polity, and those maxims and laws which would render a growing people powerful, rich and happy. It is presumed by several authors, that, during this retreat, he formed the project of uniting the states of the hep∣tarchy. In the year 799, Brithric was poisoned by his queen Edburga, which ca∣tastrophe accelerated Egbert's accession to the throne. His first attention was to train, arm, and discipline his troops, after the mode and military art he had seen practised in France, and of which he had acquired a perfect knowledge<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Higden, 251.—Malms.</NOTE>. When he had thus not only brought his subjects into a new array and discipline, but also thereby fully discovered the strength of his kingdom, he began to arrange what was necessary for the execution of his project. He travelled through the different districts of his dominions, inspected and settled all matters relative to govern∣ment and civil polity, relieved the oppressed, punished the officers in the several
<PB N="48" REF="93"/>departments of civil jurisdiction who had transgressed the laws, and harrassed the subject; cherished the church; and, by every wise method his prudence devised, he endeavoured to gain the love and confidence of his people.</P>
<P>He covered his designs with such discreet policy, that they were not discovered even in the progress of their execution. He struck his first blow against the Bri∣tons of Cornwall, and added their country to his crown. He subdued one of the dominions of Wales, that country being then severed into three principali∣ties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Higden (p. 252.) says he also took Chester from them.</NOTE>. Soon after these transactions were ended, the king of Mercia died. The heptarchy stood at that time reduced to five kingdoms, of which Egbert reigned over the most powerful; in the remaining four, confusion and anarchy prevailed; the ancient race of monarchs were become extinct, and the contending nobles struggling for royalty.</P>
<P>When Egbert was on the eve of carrying his designs into more public execu∣tion, the new king of Mercia, jealous of his preparations for war, marched with a large army towards Salisbury, where a battle was fought with great slaughter on both sides; but the victory was Egbert's, and the Mercians, by so severe an over∣throw, were not able, for a considerable time afterwards, to make a stand against the conqueror, or oppose his future measures. Egbert was sensible of the great advantages he should derive from being master of the river Thames; and that it was necessary for him to make his progress against Kent, which he soon subdued, Baldred, the king, flying into Mercia. In a little time afterwards, he made him∣self master of Essex; and, in the next place, was successful in fomenting a quar∣rel between the East-Angles and Mercians, upon which a revolt took place, the East-Angles disowned their subjection, and the armies of the two states came to an engagement, in which Bernulph, the Mercian king, was slain, and his forces routed. The powerful state of Mercia thus divided and weakened, gave a pro∣per opportunity to Egbert to declare himself an adversary; and, after se∣veral successful battles, he overcame and reduced it to a tributary state. After this event the East-Angles voluntarily submitted themselves on the same terms with the Mercians, and Northumberland alone remained unreduced<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Malms.—Ingulph.—Sax. Ann.</NOTE></P>
<P>This northern province was not able to withstand so powerful an adversary.

<P>This great revolution in Northumberland took place in the year 827 or 828<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Malms.</NOTE>, about the twentieth year of the reign of Eanred, and the seventh of Heathured's prelacy. We do not hear that any material change took place, in the affairs of the church; but the privileges and possessions of the religious in this district re∣mained uninfringed.</P>
<P>From this period the chronology of the kings of Northumberland is rather confused and uncertain: And, by reason of Egbert's sovereignty over all the states of the heptarchy, and the province of Northumberland having become de∣pendent, the connection in the history of the church of Lindisfarne and the state, is thenceforth much disunited.</P>
<P>Heathured<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Symeon Dunelm. p. 89.</NOTE>, after presiding over the church of Lindisfarne for nine years, departed this life, and was succeeded by Egred, as some authors write his name, or rather EGFRID, a person of noble birth, possessed of an enlarged mind, and strenuous in good works. He brought with him great possessions to the church. From his private fortune he built, and gave to the See for ever, the church of Norham, which he dedicated to St Peter, St Cuthbert, and St Ceolwlf; and thither he caused the royal remains to be translated, which, from Ceolwlf's death, had rested in Lindis∣farne. He gave Jedword to the church, and also the church and village which he had built at Gainford; together with the rest of his possessions between Tyne and Tees. He also gave thereto his estates at Clyff and<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Wyclif unde Wigclif haereticus originem duxit.—Leland.</NOTE> Wycliff, on the southern banks of Tees, and Billingham in Heortness.</P>
<P>During this prelate's episcopacy, Eanred, the tributary king of Northumber∣land, died; and Ethelred, his son, succeeded him<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Symeon Dunelm. p. 89.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>About this time happened a most memorable revolution in the neighbouring states of the Scots and Picts, the former of whom possessed the western parts of the country now called Scotland, and the Picts the eastern. Through the inti∣mate connection which had taken place for ages between these people, several intermarriages had happened with those of royal blood; and from thence arose a deadly feud between the two nations. Dungal, king of the Scots, by reason of an affinity derived from thence, laid claim to the Pictish crown, as heir of their deceased sovereign. The Picts refused to listen to his pretensions, regarding such an union as derogatory to their honour, and tending to deprive them of privi∣lege
<PB N="50" REF="95"/>which their ancestors purchased and established by their valour, and elected a new sovereign of the royal race. A war ensued, in which Dungal lost his life, some assert by treachery, he falling into the hands of the Picts, who butchered him with inhuman cruelty. In the sequel, the Pictish king was slain, and his dominions conquered, by Kenneth, Dungal's son, who united the two states, and was the first monarch of all Scotland. It appears the Northumbrian Saxons gave refuge to the flying Picts, and assisted them in many struggles to regain their country, which terminated only in the increase of Kenneth's power, and extension of his empire; for, in retaliation of the injuries he received from the Saxons, he car∣ried his arms against their most northern territories, and deprived them of every possession which lay on the north of Tweed. From this period it appears the Tweed became the boundary between England and Scotland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>un—Higden—Holling<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE>. Higden, from the authority of Giraldus Cambriensis, says, that Kenneth gave six defeats to the Saxons, and subdued all the country from the Scottish sea to the Tweed. An an∣cient Chronicle in the Colbertin and king of France's library says, that Kenneth invaded Saxony six times, and burnt Dunbar and Melros<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Inn. Crit. Essay, App. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>83.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The miserable dissolution of the Pictish state is scarce to be paralleled in his∣tory: Almost every memorial of its existence was destroyed, and the very lan∣guage of the people lost for ever; Kenneth's rage and insatiable revenge for the death of his father being such, that nothing less than the extirpation of the whole race could appease him<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hollingsh.</NOTE>: He spared neither age or sex, and razed their cities to their foundations, passing the ploughshare over them, that every memorial of that people might be clean done out.</P>
<P>No historian hath given us information how far the war carried on by the Nor∣thumbrians, in aid of the Picts, was prosecuted with the approbation or know∣ledge of Egbert, though so great a diminution of the Northumbrian territory was the consequence. We may form two contrary, yet probable, conjectures; either that Egbert acquiesced therein, as being jealous of Dungal and Kenneth's too great power, by the union of the kingdoms; or that the descents of the Danes, which harrassed him so much in the years 833 and 835, rendered the northern operations of little importance, during that emergency.</P>
<P>Some authors<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ridpath, &amp;c.</NOTE> conceive at this period Berwick was first fortified and made a stronghold and barrier against the Saxons, and an opposite defence to B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bbanburg, which still remained the chief fortress of the Northumbrian kingdom.</P>
<P>By our best historians it is said, the descents of the Danes, which harrassed Eg∣bert so greatly, were all made on the southern parts of Britain; so that the kingdom of Northumberland does not appear to have been much affected, or the church of Lindisfarne at all disturbed: But, on the authority of the Scala Chro∣nica, it appears, <Q>In the 33 yere of E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bright the Danis arrived at Lindisfarne, “and saught with the Engles at Carham, where ii byshhopes and a English coun∣ties were slayne, and greate numbre of people.

<PB N="51" REF="96"/>Fordun, Ridpath says, <Q>In the year that Kenneth, passing the mountains of “Drumalbin, destroyed the monarchy of the Picts, these latter people are said to have been weakened by a great overthrow they had received from the Danish ”pirates; which overthrow paved the way to Kenneth's conquest.</Q> From thence it appears, that the Danes had made a descent on the Lothians, and marched up as far as Carham on the Tweed: But, had they come nearer Lindisfarne, Symeon and other authors, whose accuracy touching the events of that See may be best re∣lied on, would not have been silent: And the words of the Scala Chronica may be construed to imply, that the Danes, on this incursion, disturbed the possessions of Lindisfarne; for, at that time, they extended north of Tweed.</P>
<P>Egbert, after a glorious reign, died in the year 838, and was succeeded by his son ETHELWULPH, as sovereign of the seven united states, to whom Ethelred, still reigning over Northumberland, did homage, as a depending prince, for his crown.</P>
<P>Our prelate, after presiding over this See for sixteen years, departed this life A. D. 845<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Angl. Sacra.</NOTE>, and was succeeded by EANBERT, whose episcopacy continued eight years.</P>
<P>Northumberland was in great commotion at the time this prelate was called to the See; for Ethelred, some few years after ascending the throne, was obliged to fly the country, threatened by one of the chief factions, which by turns had dis∣tracted that province, and now, become most powerful, had given the crown to Redwold their leader. The new king did not long enjoy his dignities; he fell in the field of battle, fighting with the ravaging Danes, who were constantly re∣peating their descents upon this island. On Redwold's death, Ethelred was re∣called, and restored; but his renewed power was soon concluded; he was assassi∣nated by the parties of a prevailing faction, who placed a lord called Osbert on the throne.</P>
<P>Ethelwulph king of England, distressed with the incessant toils of warfare, which the repeated visits from the northern rovers occasioned, resigned, to his na∣tural son Athelstan, the districts of Essex, Suffex, and Kent, under the title of king of Kent, reserving to himself the supreme sovereignty. But this division did not subsist long, the principalities being again united by the death of Athelstan.</P>
<P>It is not said how Osbert's usurpation was received by Ethelwulph, or whether he acknowledged him as his dependent. Soon after he assumed the diadem, our prelate departed this life, in the year 854; and was succeeded by<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Eanbertus, aliis Egbertus &amp; Eadbertus, Ecgredo subrogalus, sedi Lindisfarnensi annis 8 praesui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. anno 854 <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vita sublatus.

<PB N="52" REF="97"/>during whose life various revolutions in the state, and distresses in this See, took place.</P>
<P>In the year succeeding this bishop's consecration, Ethelwulph became a zealot in religion, made a visit to Rome, and, returning by France, married Leothela<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sax. Ann. — Rapin.</NOTE>, a daughter of Charles, sovereign of that kingdom<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Malms.</NOTE>, then only twelve years of age. Ethelbald, his son, had formed a conspiracy in his absence to depose him; and this new event conspired to strengthen the revolt. Appearances were so formi∣dable against Ethelwulph on his landing in England, that he was induced to come to a compromise with his son's partizans, to resign the supreme sovereignty of all England, and content himself with the dependent crown of Kent. The old king did not survive this transaction above two years, he departing this life in the year of our Lord 857, having reigned twenty years. Ethelbert, his second son, suc∣ceeded him in the kingdom of Kent, bequeathed to him by his dying father<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Malms.—Mat. West.</NOTE>; but by what right the crown was thus disposed of, no author hath said: It is most probable he received the throne of Kent on compromise with his brother Ethel∣bald, who espoused his father's widow. This fact doth not appear so enormous, when we are told, by reason of her tender years, her former marriage was not consummated, she being left under the care of her father in France. He died in the year 860, and was succeeded by Ethelbert, in whom the crowns of Kent and Wessex were again united. He reigned but six years, and died in 866, and was succeeded by his brother Ethelred, the third son of Ethelwulph.</P>
<P>No material event appears to have taken place in the See of Lindisfarne du∣ring this period. But Ethelred had not long possessed his throne before the Danes, with increased multitudes, appeared upon the northern coasts. Osbert was in the 17th year of his reign, when the ravagers landed in Northumberland. It is evident their chief objects was plunder and rapine; but authors have been ingenious in devising other inducements for their invasion. By some a story is invented, and adopted by Rapin, that king Osbert, returning from hunting to his royal residence then at York, came to the castle of Bruern Brocard, a Nor∣thumbrian nobleman, in his absence, and being desirous of some refreshment, was most courteously received and entertained by his lady, of whom he became enamoured; and, in defiance of all the principles of humanity, hospitality, and justice, constrained her to receive his embraces. Bruern on his return being in∣formed of the irreparable injury and disgrace he had received, went to court, at∣tended by his kindred and dependents, and solemnly renounced his allegiance, and the lands he held of the king. Rapin's words are: <Q>He had great interest “with the Northumbrians, and this base action of Osbert's was naturally apt
<PB N="53" REF="98"/>”to alienate the minds of his subjects from him.</Q> Accordingly, by the manage∣ment of the earl, the Bernicians in a little time revolted; and, looking upon Osbert as unworthy to govern them, elected another king, whose name was Aella, whom they placed on the throne, with a resolution to support him as sovereign of Bernicia. Thus the old divisions, which seemed to be quite extinguished, were kindled afresh, and Northumberland once more was divided between two kings and two factions, who, continually aiming at each other's destruction, were too successful in their endeavours. A civil war was the fatal consequence of this dis∣cord: The two kings frequently strove to decide their quarrel by arms; but the equality of their forces preventing the scale from preponderating on either side, each maintained himself on his respective throne. The injured earl was yet dissa∣tisfied with Osbert's-losing only half of his dominions; his revenge was incom∣plete whilst his enemy reigned in Deira: But seeing it difficult to support his op∣position longer without a foreign aid, he fatally resolved to sue for succours from the Danes. Taking his passage without delay, he fell at the feet of the king of Denmark, to whom, it is said, he was allied, relating his injuries in pathetic terms, and uttering his grief with a prevalent energy; at the same time he de∣scribed how easy it was for the Danes to make themselves masters of the whole province of Northumberland, then distracted by factions; and represented the country as lying in a temperate clime, and of a fertile soil. The Danish monarch, moved, perhaps, as much by the hope of conquest, as the desire of doing his kinsman justice, fitted out a powerful fleet and army, under the command of two approved leaders, Inguar and Hubba, said to be brothers. Matthew of Westminster says, The principal view of this Danish expedition was against the dominions of Edmund, king of the East-Angles, who was falsely charged with putting to death the father of the Danish chieftains, who had been assassinated by an exiled traitor. Collier adopts the story in the following words<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccl. Hist. l. iii. p. 160.</NOTE>: <Q>Lode∣broch, “a petty prince in Denmark, going a hawking in a boat, and designing to put in to some little island near the shore, where he expected game, was sur∣prised by a sudden storm, driven out to sea, and cast upon the English shore, near Yarmouth in Norfolk. Upon his arrival, he was seized, and brought to Edmund's court, who was then king of the East-Angles. The king was sur∣prised with the oddness of his dress, and the strangeness of his escape; and find∣ing him an excellent sportsman; was much pleased with his company. Bern, king Edmund's chief falconer, perceving himself out-done in his own business by this stranger, resolved to get rid of him. To this purpose he drew him in∣to a wood, under pretence of shewing sport, and barbarously murdered him. Upon this he goes back to court, and seems to wonder what is become of the Dane. Some few days after, Lodebroch's dog, being almost starved, comes to the palace, and, being fed, goes away again. The dog doing this several times, made the king's servants follow him; and thus they were brought to a sight of the corpse. In short, Bern was tried for the murder, and being found guilty, was condemned to be put in Lodebroch's boat, and, without either
<PB N="54" REF="99"/>tackle or provision, he was committed to the mercy of the seas. This Bern, who had the same good fortune in his passage with Lodebroch, was carried to the Danish shore, whence the other set out. The boat was immediately known; Bern was apprehended, and being examined about Lodebroch, told them, That he arrived upon the coast of the East-Angles, and was put to death by king Edmund's order. This story being believed, Inguar and Hubba, Lodebroch's ”sons, resolved upon the revenge of their father's murder.</Q> The Danes pro∣posed to land, Matthew of Westminster says, on the coasts of Edmund's kingdom; but, by contrary winds, being driven northward, arrived at Berwick upon Tweed. The convent of Coldingham having been restored, after a former conflagration, was then possessed, it is said, by nuns, under an abbess called Ebba, of royal de∣scent. She, dreading the barbarities these invaders exercised in their former de∣scent, on all ranks of religious, in an assembly of her nuns, representing the ha∣zard their chastity was in, communicated a device, which she presumed would preserve them from these violators. Without hesitation they vowed her rules should be strictly observed. Forthwith she drew a razor, and, as an example, cut off her nose and upper lip. She was followed by the whole sisterhood. When the Danes entered the convent in the morning, they were shocked with the horrid spectacle, and, disappointed in their lust, set fire to the edifice, wherein the ab∣bess, with her whole convent, were consumed. Other authors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax.</NOTE>, whose relations are attended with greater probability, fix the place of this descent at the mouth of the Humber, from whence the invaders marched to York. Osbert, at their approach, led forth a powerful army, and engaged the invaders near the city, where he fell amongst the slain, and his forces were totally routed. Aella, who had held a conflict for five years for the kingdom of Northumberland with Osbert, under the support of Bruern and his retainers, is said, upon the Danish inva∣sion, to have come to a compromise with Osbert, and joined with him against the common enemy, and that, in the issue, he also fell in the field. If the Danes had come on Bruern's invitation, and to fight his cause, Aella, who held Bernicia by the influence of his party, would never have opposed them. Malmsbury says, that the English, after the loss of their leaders, shut themselves up within the walls of York, which being set on fire by the enemy, most of them perished in the flames. But Rapin, from the authority of Meursius Hist. Dan. says, the gates of York being opened to the Danes by this victory, after they had possessed the place, Aella advanced, in hopes of repairing the injury suffered by Osbert's overthrow; the Danes marching out, gave them battle, and the English army was totally routed. Some say Aella was not slain in the field, but, being taken prisoner, the Danish general ordered him to be flead alive, in revenge for his father Lode∣broch's death<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel.

<P>These two princes are charged by Symeon, and other monkish writers, with having committed a singular outrage on the rights of the See of Lindisfarne, by seizing into their hands several valuable possessions of the church.

It is of a singular form, and a strange traditional history is told of it; that St Cuthbert's remains not resting at Norham, were car∣ried to Melros, where, shewing the same signs of agitation and restlessness as had occasioned former remo∣vals, by a vision the attendants were ordered to pacify his impatient spirit, by constructing a boat of stone, in which the sacred relics floated down the Tweed twenty miles to Tilmouth<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">By some hydrostatical experiments it has been proved capable of floating and carrying the remains of the saint.

<P>The Danes, after these victories, having laid waste the country between York and the Tyne, being possessed of all the province of Northumberland, about the year 868 made one Egbert, a creature of their own, king of that part which lies north of the river, to hold his crown as their dependent. Being afterwards en∣gaged in expeditions against the southern provinces, the Northumbrians dethroned the vassal king, and gave the crown to Riesig.

<P>Ethelred's unhappy reign was of short date, he falling in the field of battle in the year 872, having held the English sceptre only five years. In one year he fought nine pitched battles, in which he gave the highest proofs of courage and military conduct<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Malms. l. ii. c. 3.—Asser. Ann.—Sax. Ann.—Rapin.</NOTE>. He was succeeded by his son Alfred, who, for his extraor∣dinary abilities and prowess, obtained the distinguished name of Alfred the Great.</P>
<P>Halfden, who brought over a reinforcement of Danish adventurers, gave Alfred much distress: But those matters have no relation to this province. In the year 875, several ships with troops, commanded by the above-mentioned leader, enter∣ed the river Tyne, and were cantoned in the adjacent villages for the winter, it being then too late in the year to make any progress in the northern parts of Nor∣thumberland. On the opening of spring, they began their ravages on this unfor∣tunate country, and marked their progress with unequalled barbarities. Another Egbert was made king in the place of Riesig, whom Halfden deposed, or put to death, in the year 876<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Sax. Ann.</NOTE>. The new king held his dignity a very short time; for in the first year of his reign, Halfden dethroned him, and divided the country amongst the chief men of his army<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Lel.

<P>The Danes, through all their progress in these invasions, exercised the greatest severities upon the religious; and, with unremitting violence, destroyed the churches and holy places, believing them the repositories of all the wealth of the country: And therefore by various tortures, sought to extort from the priests, dis∣covery of the wealth they presumed entrusted to their guardianship. This furnished the vulgar idea, that they had the greatest aversion, to the professors of the Chris∣tian faith. Lindisfarne, in this northern expedition, was the object of their chief attention: Revived as it stood, from the former devastations, they conceived it held abundant treasures; and with merciless avarice, and disappointed hope of plunder, destroyed the monastery, and defaced every ornament of the church.</P>
<P>Our prelate having remarked the savage practices of the invaders, and their pe∣culiar barbarity to the clergy, whilst they were advancing from the river Tyne, con∣sulting with Eadred the abbot, and others of the monastery, what measures they conceived necessary to their safety, severally joined the bishop and abbot in a re∣solution not only to quit the place whose reverend sanctity among Christians ser∣ved only to expose it more to the barbarous fury of the approaching savages, but also to carry with them the uncorrupted remains of their patron saint; to whose prophetic words they paid, as it were, divine reverence, with a confident hope that they led to some felicitous conclusion. Such of the brethren as were not willing to join the bishop and abbot in this arduous and perilous pilgrimage, were left at liberty to provide for their own safety; and the rest, a small company, ga∣thering up the holy relics, the sacred vessels, ornaments, and jewels of the altars and shrines, together with Ethelwold's stone crucifix, before the Danes approach∣ed, fled from the island of Lindisfarne, where the episcopal See had been settled 241 years, and to which place, from this period, it was never restored<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hoveden—Lel. Col. v. iii.—Symeon Dunelm. p 95.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>With their holy charge, the bishop with his company passed into the mountainous parts of the country, still changing their abode as intelligence of the enemy's pro∣gress seemed to threaten their safety. We are not told, even by Symeon, of the particular course these wanderers took, or what were their resting-places, save one or two, taken notice of in the sequel. Their pious ardour must have been equal to any toil, and superior to every danger, encumbered as they were with the remains of St Cuthbert, the head of St Oswald, the bones of Aidan, Eadbert, Eanfred, and Ethelwold, inclosed in one ark or shrine, and the ponderous stone crucifix before spoken of<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 96.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Danes laid waste the country from the eastern to the western ocean, de∣stroying the religious edifices, and putting to the sword many of the most pious clergy. Amidst these perils, the little fraternity wandered from place to place with their sacred charge, surrounded with the unsheathed swords of relentless bar∣barians, amidst the burning ashes of monasteries and churches, and travelling in paths marked with the footsteps of cruelty and rapine. Symeon says, they arrived at the mouth of the river Derwent, where, a ship being obtained, they embarked and set sail for Ireland. Several of the attendants not being privy to the bishop's intention before they left the shore, gave themselves up to lamentation; and the
<PB N="57" REF="102"/>people they left on the strand, for multitudes following where the remains of St Cuthbert passed, joined the cries of their friends, to whom they imagined they now bid farewel for ever: But soon after a storm arose, described in such hor∣rible figures by this writer, that, among other things, he says, the surges that flow∣ed over the vessel were turned into blood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i. p. 329.</NOTE>. Whilst the ship was beat back, and returning towards the shore, the book of the Gospels, compiled by Ethelwold, richly ornamented with gold and jewels, fell into the sea, to the inexpressible grief of all the spectators. These unpropitious circumstances, pointing out to the unhappy voyagers that Providence was against their departure from the shores of England, they disembarked with all their treasure, except the book before mentioned, and trusted themselves again to the perils of the land. By revelation they were directed towards Candida Casa, where, searching the sea-shore, they found the precious book cast up unhurt by the waters; and, in a manner equally miraculous, obtained a carriage to transport their burden further on its journey; the particulars of which the reader may see in Symeon Dunelm, p. 109. 112.</P>
<P>Alfred, during the first six years of his reign, was much harrassed by the Da∣nish invasions, and was at last reduced, by the unfortunate events of war, to con∣ceal himself, for a considerable time, in an obscure retreat, in the marshes of So∣mersetshire. The earl of Devon, during this interval, struck a successful blow against the enemy, and taking their magic standard of Reasan, on which their su∣perstition held great dependence, the invaders were struck with a panic, which prevailed through every detachment in the island. Alfred, receiving information of this favourable crisis, discovered his retreat to some of his most faithful ad∣herents. Their scattered troops were soon collected, a place of general rendez∣vous appointed, and when the Danes least apprehended the perils which surround∣ed them, Alfred appeared at the head of a powerful army, gave them battle, and obtained a complete defeat; after which he carried victory with him wherever he bent his course.</P>
<P>His prosperity thenceforth never deserted him; his foes sued for peace; and his latter days were blessed with innumerable good works. He restored and che∣rished the church, regulated the civil polity, established excellent laws, encou∣raged learning and the arts, and was the universal patron of good and great men. For the greater security and more equal government of the people, he divided the land into shires and hundreds, and appointed to each its proper offices<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rapin.</NOTE>. One of the Danish kings, whom he conquered in battle, he induced to embrace the Christian faith, and gave him the government of East-Anglia to hold as his tri∣butary. The monkish writers relate, that, during Alfred's retreat, when his heart was overwhelmed with despondency from the adversity of his fortune, St Cuthbert appeared to him in a dream, and foretold the propitious events which were at hand, and the measures which should ensure his prosperity. The ac∣complishment of every part of this vision struck Alfred's mind with such religious veneration for the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aint, as the emissary of Heaven predicting the divine will, that he afterwards became the peculiar patron of the religious of this province, of
<PB N="58" REF="103"/>which he gave the following instance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Symeon Dunelm.</NOTE>. The Danes in Northumberland being left without a leader by the death of Halfden, Eadred, the abbot, having wan∣dered with the bishop and their sacred charge, from one place of obscurity and retreat to another, for near seven years, at length rested at Crake, where they were hospitably received and cherished by Geve, the abbot, for near four months. Whilst they remained at Crake, the abbot had a vision, which he related to a nu∣merous assembly of Danes and English; declaring that St Cuthbert appeared to him, and uttered a command to the following purport:—<Q>Say to the people that “I have sent thee, commanding them to bring forth Guthred, the son of Hardi∣knut, whom they sold to a widow woman as a slave. When he is discovered, and the price of his redemption paid, let him be shewn to the multitude; and it being my will, and I rejoicing therein, bind the armilla<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Armilla, a royal gem or insignia used in those days to distinguish the prince elect. It was formed like the modern bracelets.</NOTE> on his right ”arm, and let him be proclaimed king.</Q> This command was received by all the people with acclamations of joy: The youth was found in the vale of Whit∣tingham in the employment of a slave; was redeemed, and, with Alfred's appro∣bation, received the crown of Northumberland as his dependent. There appears much policy in this affair; for, by appointing the son of a Danish general of fame, and of revered memory amongst his countrymen, the minds of that people were conciliated; and, under the influence of their patron saint, the old Nor∣thumbrians were reconciled to his government. Rapin seems to confound his ideas of the kings of East-Anglia and Northumberland from the similarity of name, and to mistake the meaning of Asserius, his authority. Symeon, who in this matter is most likely to be correct, and the Chronicle of Melros, give the above relation<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Symeon Dunelm. p. 118.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Symeon gives a dreadful description of Halfden's diseases and death, the perse∣cutor of the church of Lindisfarne and its saints for seven years. Amidst the horrors of a raving madness, and excruciating anguish of body, such a pestiferous stench proceeded from his diseased carcase, that he was abandoned by his fellow-creatures. Abhorred of all human kind, he put to sea from the river Tyne with a few mariners<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>, and was soon after swallowed up by the ocean, with his whole crew<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 372.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>After Guthred was established on the throne, and peace prevailed in Northum∣berland, Alfred having brought the rest of his empire under a happy government, the bishop and abbot, with their train, moved the sacred remains from Crake to Chester on the Street, where Eardulph began to found a new cathedral; it being held impolitic, as well as inconsistent with the interest of religion, to return to Lindisfarne; a situation so immediately exposed to the descents of a foreign enemy, so distant from the royal residence, which was then established at York, and from the aid of the civil or military power, on any public emergency or danger<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i. p. 329.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Guthred, thus raised to the throne, in pious gratitude for the distinguished pa∣tronage of St Cuthbert, with the consent and concurrence of Alfred, encreased
<PB N="59" REF="104"/>the possessions of the church by a donation of all that tract of country which lies between the rivers Were and Tyne. The royal will being declared to the people, both English and Danes, in a general assembly, it received the confirmation of the public voice, and was established for ever. The two sovereigns also granted to the church where St Cuthbert's remains should rest for the time being, the privi∣lege of sanctuary, for every fugitive, for thirty-seven days, by no authority, or on any occasion whatsoever, to be broken; and this was supported by a mulct to be paid to the saint by any offender who should infringe this privilege, equal to that imposed on persons breaking the peace, viz. 961., a large sum in those days. Besides the grant and privilege before mentioned, the two sovereigns, with the consent of the whole people, ordained, That whatever lands or possessions were given to St Cuthbert, or purchased with his money, should be discharged and freed of all customs and services for ever, and be possessed and enjoyed by the church quietly and freely; together with all customs, services, rights and privi∣leges, vulgarly called Soca and Socne, and Infangentheof. A dreadful anathe∣ma was pronounced, with all the terrors of hell on those who should presume to break those ordinances<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Angl. Sacra.—Hoveden—Camden—Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 372. —Symeon, p. 119.—&amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>According to Fordun and Boethius, Gregory the Great of Scotland, during Guthred's reign, invaded Northumberland, and obtained a complete victory over the Danes. Monastic writers say, that the Northumbrian king, having marched to oppose the Scots, and put a stop to the ravages they were making in the nor∣thern parts of his territories, when the armies were formed for battle, and the charge was sounding, by the interposition of Heaven the conflict was stayed, for the earth opened, and in the yawning gulph the whole Scottish host was swallowed up<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sym. D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2.—Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 372.</NOTE>. This miraculous event was attributed to the mediation of St Cuthbert, whose place of residence the enemy had sacked, the old monastery of Lindisfarne not yet having experienced its latest evils. The Scottish writers above mentioned seem totally at a loss to account for the conclusion of Gregory's expedition, or are ashamed to relate the overthrow he met with, which, under the superstitious pens of monastic writers, is related in the figurative stile before adopted; from whence nothing more can be inferred, than that the enemy were vanquished and dispersed. But Hollingshed says, Alfred made a truce with Gregory, and entered into an alliance offensive and defensive against foreign enemies, and that thereupon Northumberland was ceded to the Scots.

D. 894; soon after which event, the Northumbrian Danes, notwithstanding the benefits they enjoyed under Alfred's wise government, and the security in which they held their posses∣sions during Guthred's reign, joined themselves to new swarms of their country∣men, who landed on those shores, and made war on Alfred's southern dominions. But though this new invasion engaged his arms for near three years, Alfred was attended with an uninterrupted series of success; and after having out down, in
<PB N="60" REF="105"/>various engagements, the remnant of the enemy, they retreated, or rather fled in small parties through the mountains, to the most northern parts of Northum∣berland, where they obtained vessels to transport them to Normandy. After the foe was fled, Alfred brought Northumberland into subjection; and not appointing any dependent sovereign either over that state, or the East-Angles, who had a short time before lost their king, he was the first monarch who in immediate sub∣jection held all the provinces of the heptarchy under his own sceptre<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 329.—Symeon Dunelm. p. 124.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the same year, Alfred, and Eardulph the bishop, departed this life, A. D. 900<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i. p. 329.—Ang. Sacra, p. 699.</NOTE>, Eardulph having held his episcopal character for 46 years, of which 18 years was elapsed after the See was settled at Chester. His piety and patience un∣der the persecution of the church was distinguished. His veneration of St Cuth∣bert's name and character, and his perseverence in the labours and distresses which he suffered in the cause of religion and the church of Lindisfarne, were extraordinary.</P>
<P>The possessions of this See were now become extensive; the mutilation suffered under Osbert and Aella being of little consequence, compared to the vast territory, which the church now held, viz. Lindisfarne, Carlisle, Jedwordes, Norham, and Gainford, with their dependencies; and all the lands between Were and Tyne.</P>
<P>No records are extant of the grants from Guthred and Alfred, any more than of the grant of Egbert, which is deemed a forgery of the monks. But grants of such antiquity, and in an unlettered age, were only pronounced orally in the great assembly of the states, the Wittagenmote of the people, and confirmed by their acclamations; some uncertain accounts of which are entered in the monastic re∣cords: And it was on no better authority that the royal grants in after times were established and confirmed.</P>
<P>Wharton<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Angl. Sacra, p. 699.</NOTE>, speaking of the above-mentioned grant by Guthred, has these words: <Q><HI>Totam siquidem terram inter Vedram &amp; Tinam fluvios perpetuo jure possi∣denda “”largitus, omnem inter Vedram et Tesam fluvios terram postea adjecit.</HI></Q> Sy∣meon, in rehearsing the visionary demand of St Cuthbert, and the royal grant, only specifies the lands between Were and Tyne: And the greatest credit is to be given to this writer, when speaking of the possessions of his own church, where he doth not attempt to enlarge the idea of its riches. Had the other much larger territory, between Were and Tees, been afterwards granted by the same royal per∣sonages, he would not have neglected to have recorded it. The latter territory was afterwards added to the See, but it is probable it came by allotments, and at various times; and was not, at the time of Alfred, comprehended in any grant to the church of St Cuthbert.</P>
<P>It has been observed, that the lands granted to the See of Lindisfarne by Eg∣bert, were to be held in as full and ample a manner as in the hands of the king. Whether any civil jurisdiction passed therewith to the ecclesiastics, is only to be distinguished by the exercise of rights. In this place therefore, taking a final leave of Lindisfarne as the episcopal seat, no instance has been discovered of the
<PB N="61" REF="106"/>bishops exercising any civil jurisdiction, or any commencement or origin of a pa∣latine power, in this antiquity of the church. In the grant of Guthred, con∣firmed by Alfred and the people, a civil power attends the possessions <HI>inter Tynam &amp; Vedram:</HI> They were made an infranchised seigniory, with an appendent juris∣diction over the inhabitants, in which the bishop, who always represents the per∣son of St Cuthbert, had his <HI>saca</HI> and <HI>socne,</HI> under which, Bracton says<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. iii, t. 2. c. 8.</NOTE>, the lord of the liberty had power in his court to pass judgment on offenders found within his jurisdiction, according to the laws and customs of the kingdom: And, under such lords, the landholders held their possessions by various customs and ser∣vices. The same privileges were afterwards granted to lords of manors, for the more immediate and effectual dispensation of justice.</P>
<P>The Danish invasions, and the devastations those troops of savages made, occa∣sioned the See of Hexham to be neglected and vacant for the space of 63 years. After Eardulph was seated at Chester, he exercised the episcopal function there, and Hexham remained united to the translated See of Lindisfarne for about 230 years<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Symeon, l. ii.—Wharton.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The indefatigable piety and labours of those who passed through a seven years pilgrimage with the remains of St Cuthbert, have already been noticed; but it doth not appear that those personages, so famous in history for their reli∣gious zeal, were people of much erudition. The ancient writers have carefully related from what seminaries our first bishops were derived; but those of later date are totally unobserved upon; and, in the great confusion of the state, it is doubtful were elected out of the body of monks in the monastery of Lindisfarne, and were of no distinguished learning. The monkish writers were anxious to give praise to their dignified brethren, where it was due; they even laboured every occasion which served that purpose: Their silence consequently gives an appre∣hension that our later prelates had no claim to the name of learned men. Col∣lier's<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Collier, p. 165.</NOTE> words are: <Q>The late ravages of the Danes had ruined the commonwealth “of learning, and frighted the Muses out of the island. This barbarous enemy seemed to proclaim war against sense and understanding: They hated to see the English better polished than themselves; and as they plundered the monasteries out of covetousness, so they burnt the libraries out of envy, that there might ”be nothing remaining to reproach their ignorance.</Q></P>
<P>That learning was at a very low ebb in Alfred's reign, appears by his letter to bishop Wulfsig; in which he says, <Q>Both the clergy and laity of the English were “formerly bred to letters, and made great improvements in the creditable scien∣ces; that, by the advantage of such a learned education, the precepts of reli∣gion and loyalty were well observed; the church and state flourished, and the government was famous for its conduct in foreign countries: And as to the clergy, they were particularly eminent for their instructions, for acting up to the expectations of their character, and discharging all the parts of their function to commendation, insomuch that strangers used to come hither for learning,
<PB N="62" REF="107"/>discipline, and improvement. But now the case is miserably altered, and we have need of travelling to learn what we used to teach. Indeed knowledge is so entirely vanished from the English, that there are very few on this side the Humber that can either translate a piece of Latin, or so much as understand ”the liturgy in the mother tongue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Asser. de Alfred. reb. gest. p. 27.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>It doth not appear that the See continued vacant any length of time after the death of the last bishop, who was succeeded<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i. p. 330.</NOTE> by CUTHEARD. He was studious to augment the possessions of the church. With the treasures of St Cuthbert he purchased or redeemed Sedgefield, with its appurtenances, which was then held by three persons not distinguished in history, but named, by the monastic writers, Aculf, Ethelbrith, and Frithlak. He also purchased Bedlington, with its appendages, Nederton, Gurb, Batbise, Lebbington, Sliceburn, and Cam∣bois, laying in that district now called the county of Northumberland<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. v. ii. p. 373.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There were other benefactors in his time, who contributed to encrease the pos∣sessions of St Cuthbert by their donations. Tilred, an abbot, repurchased or re∣deemed South Eden, one moiety of which he gave to St Cuthbert, that he might become a brother in his monastery; and the other moiety to Norton, that he might be abbot there. Barnard, a priest, about the same time, gave to St Cuth∣bert his villa of Willington, that he might be admitted one of the fraternity of his monastery.</P>
<P>On Alfred's demise, Edward the Elder, his son, mounted the throne of Eng∣land; but Ethelward, his cousin, son of Ethelbert, claiming the crown in a line of inheritance against Edward, who was the issue of a younger brother, and no right appearing in Ethelwold to authorise him to settle the succession, as he had presumed to do, many supported his claim, and much mischief ensued. He first raised commotions in Dorsetshire; but finding no support there, equal to the power of the prince he opposed, he fled into Northumberland, and was received by the Danes, constantly ready for insurrection and warfare, with acclamations of joy; they immediately proclaiming him king. But on Edward's marching northward with a powerful army, they were obliged to expel their new sovereign, and sue for peace. Ethelward fled to France<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Hen. Hunting. lib. viii.—Lel. Col. v. i. p. 218.</NOTE>, from whence, in a short time, he returned, with a strong body of Normans, obtained by the plausibility of his claim to the crown. With those forces he landed in Essex, and the Northumbrians taking up arms on the news of his arrival, marched into Mercia, and marked their progress with most horrid ravages. Edward having collected his troops, met the invaders in several bloody conflicts, in which Ethelward's party repeatedly suffered great loss; and at last he fell in the field<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">A. D. 905. Sax. Ann.</NOTE>; which obliged the Danes to make peace on the best terms their aggressions would allow them to procure. But this paci∣fication was of short duration; the war broke out again within the period of three
<PB N="63" REF="108"/>years, the Danes not regarding the treaty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. p. 421.</NOTE>; and Northumberland was over-run and plundered for five weeks by Edward's exasperated army, which every where prevailed against the insurgents<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sax. Ann. Hunt. p. 352.—Lel. Col. v. i. p. 214.</NOTE>. Two great battles were fought, in which Ed∣ward was victorious, several thousands falling by the sword, amongst which were two Danish princes, Eowils and Healfden, (whom Flor. of Worcester calls bro∣thers of K. Hinguar), who were succeeded by Regnald, who was proclaimed King of Northumberland<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sax. Ann.—Flor. Wor.—Hunt. p. 352.—Brompton— Rapin.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Rapin<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">p. 98.</NOTE> says, <Q>from the year 910, when the war betwixt the English and “Danes was rekindled, to the year 922, there is nothing in history but a long ”series of battles, the relation whereof must be unpleasant to the reader.</Q></P>
<P>Amidst such distresses of the country, no injury appears to have been done to the new settled See, save what Symeon says of two of Regnald's leaders, Scula and Onlafbal, who seized on that part of the country which lies between Eden and Billingham, afflicting the inhabitants with grievous impositions, and a heavy tribute, adding thereto the greatest contempt of the church, and sanctity of its patron, Cuthbert; for which, according to the monastic accounts, Onlafbal suf∣fered an exemplary punishment<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 373.—Symeon, p. 125.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Cutheard, after presiding over this See for fifteen years, in 915 was succeeded by TILRED, who possessed the See for fourteen years and upwards. No character of this prelate is given by ancient authors; but it appears he was a man of piety and godly life, by the veneration in which his church was held by Edward during the latter years of his life, and Athelstan his successor.</P>
<P>Northumberland, during all this prelate's time, was involved in seditions and bloodshed. It was chiefly inhabited by Danes at this time, having become the common receptacle for the vagabonds of that people from all other parts of the island; who were full of turbulence, and of a ferocity of temper which was only gratified by war and tumult.</P>
<P>About the time of Tilred's consecration, the Northumbrians, in conjunction with their countrymen in some of the southern provinces, making insurrections, and on every occasion appearing in arms, induced K. Edward to prosecute with all vigour their total reduction. He moved with a powerful army towards the north; but information being received of his intentions, he had scarce entered the frontiers of the province of Northumberland before Regnald, and Alred, son of Eadulf, kings of that state, with all their people, submitted themselves<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">A. D. 924.—Flor. Wig.—Sax. Ann.—Malms.—M. West.</NOTE>. According to the Saxon Chronicle<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">p. 110.</NOTE>, not only all the northern potentates, but also the king and nation of Scotland, did homage to Edward, as their supreme. Ridpath, who is a Scotch writer, takes notice of this circumstance; and adds,<PB N="64" REF="109"/>this is the first mention of Scotland being brought under the sovereignty of any Saxon monarch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 46.</NOTE>. What became of the Northumbrian princes after this sub∣mission, we are not well informed. Alred is not named at all. Rapin writes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">p. 99.</NOTE>, that Sithric, and Nigel his brother, reigned beyond the Tyne; and Regnald, who resided at York, ruled all the country between Tyne and Humber. Some time after, Sithric having slain his brother Nigel, became sole king of the north<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hen. Hunting. lib. vii.— Lel. Col. v. i. p. 214.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>K. Edward, full of honour and heroic virtues, completed his days in the year 925; having spent a glorious life, eminent for his wise government and victori∣ous arms.</P>
<P>Elsward, the deceased sovereign's eldest son, survived him but a few days; and the rest of his legitimate children being in their minority, Athelstan his son, by Egwina, a concubine, ascended the throne<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Egwina, a shepherd's daughter, as she lay asleep in the fields, dreamt that the moon shone out of her womb so bright, that all England was enlightened by the splendor. Some time after, she took occasion to relate her dream to an old woman that had been K. Edward's nurse. This woman, who pretended to in∣terpret dreams, imagining there was something extraordinary in this, took Egwina into her house, and edu∣cated her, not as a country wench, but a person of quality. Egwina answered all the old nurse's care and pains about her, and in time became an accomplished beauty. Whilst she was in the house of her bene∣factrese, prince Edward, before he was king, happening to pass by the place where his nurse lived, made her a visit. He cast his eyes on Egwina, and immediately fell desperately in love with her. His passion was so violent, that, in the most moving and affecting manner, he solicited the nurse to put him in prossession of the charming Egwina. The old woman, who had always a great affection for Edward, and had always the dream in her thoughts, yielded to his request, and brought Egwina to consent to what he desired so passion∣ately. From that time Edward was extremely fond of Egwina, and had by her three children, of whom Athelstan, the eldest succeeded him.—Rapin, p. 99.</NOTE>, with the consent of the clergy and nobility, and was anointed and crowned king of England at Kingston upon Thames, by Athelm, archbishop of Canterbury. Athelstan had received the or∣der of knighthood from Alfred his grandfather, and his education under Ethel∣red, the celebrated earl of Mercia, who married Elfleda, his aunt, the most vir∣tuous and heroic princess of the age. As he was admitted to all their councils, and attended them in all their warlike operations and expeditions, he is said to have acquired, under those great examples, a most admirable knowledge in mili∣tary and political affairs, and was esteemed the most accomplished prince that had ascended the throne.</P>
<P>Edwin, the deceased king's eldest legitimate son, was very young: Yet some dissatisfied nobles, who objected to Athelstan's birth, with Alfred, a powerful lord at their head, entered into a conspiracy to take off the king by assassination, and place the crown on the head of Edwin. But this project being discovered, Alfred fled to Rome, where he died. The Northumbrian Danes seized the hour of confusion for rising in arms, hoping the confederacy would afford them suf∣ficient occasion for ravage and plunder. It does not appear that their object was independence, or their pretext redress of grievances; neither had they any fa∣vourite chieftain, issue of their own kings, to serve. It proceeded from their habitual bent for rapine. Athelstan having appeased the minds of the seditious in the southern provinces, exercising no other severity against the offenders but the confiscation of Alfred's estate, which he granted to the monastery of Malms∣bury,
<PB N="65" REF="110"/>with great alacrity marched northward, and was on the borders of Nor∣thumberland before the insurgents presumed he was apprised of their intentions. Sithric sued for peace, on any terms the sovereign would grant; on which sub∣mission, Athelstan not only pardoned the revolters, but also gave the prince his sister Editha to wife, on condition that he became a Christian; thereby hoping to put an end to the continual rebellions in that province. But whatever hopes Athelstan entertained from thence, they were dissipated by the hasty death of Sithric, who died within the year<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A. D. 926. Chron. J. Wallingford.</NOTE>. Fordun says, he was cut off by treachery; and Boethius very expressly declares, that Athelstan induced his sister to give him poison<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ford. l. iv. p. 24.—Boeth. l. xi.</NOTE>. Matthew of Westminster accounts thus for the event: That, to secure to himself the crown under Athelstan's auspices, he renounced the errors of his religion; but, soon after his marriage, returning again to paganism, and his old idolatry, he died an uncommon and shameful death<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mat. of West. p. 185.</NOTE>: And he with Florence of Worcester<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The sons of Sithric finding she was of counsel in poysoning her husband, they caused hir to be appre∣hended, and put to death on this wyfe.

On Sithric's death, Adulph endeavoured to possess the sceptre, and seized Bambrough, from whence he was soon expelled by Athelstan, who again brought the Northumbrians to submission. Sithric left two sons by a former marriage, neither of whom Athelstan thought proper to place on the throne; and it is uncertain whether he appointed any one to the immediate government of Northumberland. It appears<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Malms.—Chron. Sax.</NOTE> that Godred, the second son, seized the crown without the sovereign's consent, and took possession of the fortresses of the coun∣try; but, on Athelstan's approach, he abdicated the throne, and fled into Scot∣land<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 374.—Ang. Sac. p. 700.—Sym. Dun. p. 129.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>During these troublesome events, our prelate departed this life, and was suc∣ceeded by WIGRED in the year 928, and at a time of incessant commotions in the province of Nor∣thumberland. Anlaf, Sithric's eldest son, had taken refuge in Ireland, and God∣red in Scotland, where they were equally making interest to be restored to the throne of their father, and to disturb Athelstan in his government. The sove∣reign, offended at the protection the fugitive obtained in the court of Constantine, the Scottish monarch, contrary to the principles of submission his crown had re∣ceived from that state, levied a great army, and marched against Scotland. Rid∣path<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">p. 47.</NOTE> says, he invaded that kingdom, wherein, according to the English historians,
<PB N="66" REF="111"/>his arms prevailed over all opposition, and the king was obliged to submit to the victor, as his sovereign lord. But Rapin writes, that it was not known what was become of Regnald, and Anlaf was fled into Ireland; so that Athelstan was obli∣ged to be satisfied with requiring Constantine king of Scotland to deliver up God∣red. Constantine, sensible he was not in a condition to deny any thing to a prince at the head of so powerful an army, promised to deliver the fugitive into his hands, and give him a meeting at Dacor. But in the mean time Godred ef∣fected an escape; and Constantine, with Eugenius king of Cumberland, came to the appointed convention; where the Scottish king acquitting himself of all cul∣pability relative to the prince's escape, Athelstan dismissed the two sovereigns on their doing homage. Whilst Athelstan was thus employed, Godred arrived at York, some of his friends holding the castle there, which had not been surren∣dered to the sovereign; but, on Athelstan's assaulting it, according to Malmsbu∣ry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Malms. p. 50.</NOTE>, it was surrendered, and he destroyed it to the very foundation. Godred, in despair, took to sea, and committed depredations as a pirate. At length, wearied with the various excesses, he submitted himself, and received his pardon, with a small pension for his support: soon after which he was no more heard of<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rapin, p. 100.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Anlaf was more successful; for having established an interest in Ireland, he pas∣sed over into Scotland, where, by artful insinuations, he won on Constantine's mind, inspiring fears that Athelstan's too great power would induce him to re∣duce the crown of Scotland, and bring the whole island under his dominion: That the most politic measure to regain the independence of his kingdom, and secure it from conquest, was to support the Danish interest in Northumberland, which would always be a strong barrier against the English monarchs, and they a people so inferior in strength, as never to disturb his powerful state. To those arguments he added assurances, that he would join the attempt with a powerful armament from Ireland; and predicted success from the measures which they con∣certed. It was determined among other things, that the Welch should take up arms to divert Athelstan's attention, whilst they prepared to make a grand descent on the banks of the Humber.</P>
<P>The plan being formed, Anlaf returned to Ireland, and the Welch appeared in the field; but the Irish levies not coming in time, they were crushed in the first battle by Athelstan's superior arms. He then moved towards Scotland, to chastise that kingdom for the part the Scots had taken in this insurrection; and Anlaf still not arriving, Constantine sued for peace; which was granted by the sovereign, who remained ignorant of the great design formed against his govern∣ment.</P>
<P>Athelstan returned to his capital, where he suffered the shock of some family distresses<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Putting his brother to death on suspicion of being concerned in a conspiracy against him; of which different authors give different accounts.—Malmsbury, Huntingdon, Brompton, Buchanan, &amp;c.</NOTE>; during which private embarrassments, Anlaf entered the Humber with a fleet of 600 sail, (Hollingshed says 615 ships and crayers), before the king had any intelligence of his approach. There is some confusion touching the invader,
<PB N="67" REF="112"/>some authors asserting he was not Sithric's son, but an Irish prince, and king of the Isles, son-in-law of Constantine: And Ridpath, in his Border History, has adopted part of this account. But Rapin justly explodes it. Hollingshed asserts, he married Constantine's daughter. The Scots and Welch joined to assist Anlaf, and the whole force of the Northumbrian Danes was in arms on his landing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. iii.</NOTE>. Athelstan, with amazing alacrity, levied an army, and marched in pursuit of the invaders, who were hastening into Bernicia to reduce that district, but were so hard pressed by the pursuers, that they were obliged to make a stand, and give the English battle at Brunanburg, a place not now distinguished by any of our wri∣ters. The victory was Athelstan's, in which Constantine fell, with six other po∣tentates, Irish and Welch, and twelve earls and commanders. The great success of the day was attributed to the sage conduct of the king's cousin, Turketul, af∣terwards abbot of Croyland. Cumberland and Westmorland were taken from the Scots; Northumberland was put under a severe tribute, and other marks of hu∣miliation; and the Welch, pent up within narrow limits, marked by the river Wye, were charged with a tribute of twenty pound weight of gold, three hun∣dred of silver, and twenty-five thousand head of cattle. Ridpath, from the au∣thority of Fordun<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">l. iv. c. 25.</NOTE>, asserts, that Constantine escaped from the battle, and retired to the monastery of St Andrew, where he spent the remaining five years of his life. Hollingshed says, <Q>Some have written, that Constantine kyng of Scottes “was slayne at this overthrowe, and five other small kynges or rulers, with twelve dukes, and well near all the army of those strange nations whiche Anlafe had gathered togither. But the Scotish chronicles affirme, that Constantine was not there himself, but sent his son Malcolme, which yet escaped sore hurt and wounded from this battell, as in the same chronicles yee may see more at ”large.</Q></P>
<P>The above author has this remarkable passage: That Godred, with a great power, entering Northumberland, besieged the city of Duresme, soliciting the ci∣tizens to receive him, which they would gladly have done, if they had not per∣ceived he was not of power sufficient to resist the puissance of Athelstan. Other authors fix this enterprize at York. It does not appear that any place at that time was known by the name of Duresme.</P>
<P>K. Athelstan, as Symeon says, in the tenth year of our prelate's pontificate, gave to the sepulchre of St Cuthbert several rich gifts and ornaments, in his time preserved in the church of Durham, but which he forbears to describe, as being set forth in the common cartulary of that religious house. He also granted to the Church twelve villages, with their appendages; and confirmed the laws, privi∣leges, customs and jurisdictions, which his grandfather Alfred, and Guthred, insti∣tuted; and ordained that they should be observed and kept for ever; and he en∣joined his brother Edmund, that, if he should fall in his Scots expedition, his remains should be interred in the church of St Cuthbert.

<P>Athelstan departed this life, after a glorious and successful reign, though full of warfare, in the year 940, or 941, in the 46th year of his age, and 16th of his reign, having added several wholesome laws to those of his predecessors. Notwithstanding his confirmation of the privileges of the church of St Cuthbert, from the general tenor of his laws, it is discernible, he held a strong dislike to ec∣clesiastical immunities and special jurisdictions, which he apprehended were preju∣dicial to the state at large, and to the civil polity of the people.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by Edmund, eldest legitimate son of Edward, stiled the Elder; who with general approbation ascended the throne of England, whilst the whole empire was in a state of profound peace.</P>
<P>The young king, who had just attained the age of eighteen, was not long in possession of a peaceful dominion. The Danes, still turbulent, recalled Anlaf from his place of retreat, who, fully conscious by experience that nothing could be done without a foreign aid, applied to Olaus king of Norway, to whom he en∣gaged to pay a large sum of money if he was successful; on which terms a pow∣erful force was granted, with which he approached the city of York, whose gates were thrown open to him; and this example prevailed with all the lesser places of strength within the province of Northumberland. Not content with this posses∣sion, and flushed with success, he marched into Mercia, where he won a consider∣able territory. Edmund, with all the ardour of youth, levied his forces, and approached to give Anlaf battle. The two armies met near Chester in the west, and the engagement, which was fought with great prowess on both sides, conti∣nued till night obliged the combatants to desist from the dreadful havoc of the sword, which hitherto had not been able to give advantage to either party. Both sides rested on their arms, prepared to renew the fight at the dawn of day. The archbishops of Canterbury and York, then attending the contending poten∣tates, during this interval laboured to bring about a peace, in which also the nobles on both sides were extremely solicitous. In consequence of this formidable coalition, Edmund was obliged to resign to Anlaf all the tract of country north of Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling-street, running from North-Wales to the sea on the southern parts of Kent: By which treaty and cession the kingdom of Northumberland comprehended a boundary more extensive than it had known in any age, containing several coun∣tries never, previous to that time, within the jurisdiction of that province.</P>

<P>About this period our prelate, who does not seem to have taken any part in the political system, departed this life in the third year of Edmund's reign, having filled the See about seventeen years; in which time, as before observed, the riches and possessions of the church were much increased<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wharton—Symeon, p. 132.—Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 375.</NOTE>. He was succeeded by UHTRED, of whom Symeon makes no further mention, than merely to insert his name: And the other monastic writers are totally silent. He filled the See little more than three years, during which short period the province of Northumberland was in great commotion.</P>
<P>Anlaf was no sooner settled on his throne, than he began to pursue measures for satisfying the obligations he entered into with the king of Norway; on which account he oppressed his subjects with some heavy taxes. The affections of his people were not with him. The inhabitants of Deira, oppressed by his impositions, quickly revolted, and drawing Godred's son from his place of retreat, elected him king of that province. The consequence of such measures was an immediate preparation for war by both parties. Edmund, observing the contention, march∣ed an army to the borders, and there, as arbiter of the dispute, made peace be∣tween the dissatisfied parties, on condition that Regnald possessed the crown of Deira, to which he was elected, and they both became his tributaries. This deci∣sion only laid the foundation of new projects; each party was dissatisfied that Ed∣mund should exercise a sovereignty over him; and, as being a foe to them both, they immediately forgot their own quarrel, and entered into a confederacy to shake off obedience. The sovereign having early intelligence of their compact, with forced marches, in a little time, gained the frontiers with a powerful army, and possessed himself of several places of strength on the border, before the con∣federate kings had collected their forces. Edmund's determined mind gave them little hopes of reconciliation; and the only prospect which remained, was to escape his sury, and depart the land. This event induced the Danes, who were gather∣ing together from all quarters, to throw down their arms, and swear allegiance. In this expedition Edmund seized the kingdom of Cumberland, and gave it to Malcolm, king of the Scots, to hold, as a fief of his crown, by homage; there∣by engaging that monarch in a firm alliance. There is no account what person succeeded to the Northumbrian sceptre, either under the auspices of Edmund, or by the election of the people; neither is any king of that province spoken of un∣til the succeeding reign<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Wharton A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g.

<P>Our prelate departed this life in the year 947, and was succeeded by SEXHELM, a person of depraved mind, who possessed the See for a few months only. Sy∣meon says, he was so far from being like his predecessors, that he gave himself up
<PB N="70" REF="115"/>to the love of riches; to attain which he oppressed not only the people who inha∣bited the territories belonging to the church, but also the very ministers officiating in sacred duties. He adds, that the bishop was admonished by dreams against practices so derogatory to the honour of his holy function; and those visions were so powerfully repeated, and attended with such afflictions of body, that at length he retired from the See in the greatest horror of mind, and was not restored to sanity, till he had gone beyond the utmost limits of St Cuthbert's liberties, and arrived near York, where his diseases forsook him in a miraculous manner. There appears, in the whole relation, a plain demonstration of his insanity, with∣out any miraculous interposition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For his character, see Lel. Col. v. i. p. 329.—Sym. Dun. p. 136.—Angl. Sacra, p. 700.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On Sexhelm's desertion of the See, ALDRED was consecrated, of whom Symeon and other writers say little more, than that he died in the year 968, having possessed this See twenty-one years and up∣wards.</P>
<P>It is not surprising that nothing should be said of this prelate, when the great revolutions which took place in his time are considered, and the repeated scenes of distraction and warfare, in which Northumberland was involved.</P>
<P>Aldred had but a short time possessed his church when Edmund came to his tragical end, in the 25th year of his age, and 8th of his reign<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">One day as he was solemnizing a festival at Pucklekirk in Gloucestershire, he espied Leolf, a notorious robber, who, though banished the kingdom for his crimes, had the impudence to come and sit at one of the tables in the hall where the king was at dinner. Enraged at his insolence, he commanded him to be apprehended; but perceiving he was drawing a dagger to defend himself, the king leapt up in great fury, and catching hold of him by the hair, dragged him out of the hall. This imprudent action cost him his dagger, so that he immediately expired upon the body of his murderer. The story is told with some little variations, though all the authors agree in the catastrophe.—Malms.—Bromp.—Hoved.—Chro. Melros.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This prince, during the short time he ruled, and in the few recesses he en∣joyed from military exploits, made several excellent laws. He had observed that fines, and pecuniary mulcts, did not deter evil men from crimes of the highest na∣ture, and besides, many who committed them were in a state of poverty, or had little to lose; therefore he ordained, that in gangs of robbers apprehended, the oldest of them should be condemned to die on the gallows: Which was the first law in England to punish that offence with death.</P>
<P>On the demise of Edmund, A. D. 948, he leaving two infant sons, Edwy and Edgar, his brother Edred, with the unanimous consent of clergy and nobility, was elected and crowned king of England at Kingston, by Odo, archbishop of Canterbury.</P>
<P>His reign commenced in conflicts with the Northumbrian Danes, who, on the death of Edmund, thought it a fit opportunity to rise in arms, and renew their infamous rapine on the adjoining territories. Their weakness in numbers would
<PB N="71" REF="116"/>not allow them to entertain any superior views to those of plunder. It appears they had influence sufficient with K. Malcolm of Scotland to induce him to join them; who presumed the death of Edmund dissolved his obligations; and that nation shewing a restless disposition, similar to their Danish neighbours, perhaps with similar views, engaged in the enterprise. K. Edred's ministers, jealous of the turbulent humour of the Danes, held a strict eye over their conduct, and gained intelligence of their purposes so early, that the English army had penetra∣ted the heart of Northumberland before they presumed the design of a revolt could be discovered. This sudden attack obliged them to sue for mercy. The king laid waste the country in his advance, with particular marks of indignation, so that it remained, a long time after his avengeful progress, uncultivated for many miles; and in this devastation the monastery of Ripon was burnt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Malms. p. 155.—Ingulph. p. 51.</NOTE>. He punished some of the leaders of this commotion with great severity, and on others he imposed a heavy fine<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hoveden—Lel. Col. v. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Having re-established peace in Northumberland, he marched his army into Scotland, to chastise Malcolm for his breach of truce, and obliged him to renew his homage.</P>
<P>Edred was scarce seated in his capital before the perfidious Danes recalled An∣laf, and proclaimed him their king. He having gained experience by adversity, used the utmost expedition to possess all the places of strength in the province, which he effected before Edred could assemble his army. His wise disposition of his forces, and the formidable appearance his armament made, persuaded the so∣vereign that it would cost him much blood and treasure to effect his deposition; therefore, with a distinguished prudence, he delayed attacking those territories till some favourable crisis should offer itself; thereby giving leisure to Anlaf, who thought himself secure of the crown, to yield to the natural bent of his temper, which was turbulent and tyrannical. His subjects, whose natural ferocity and im∣patience of submission have been marked in the progress of their history, could not brook the countenance of severity, which their impetuous humour pretended to discover in his military discipline and strict rules of government. In a little time so formidable a party was raised against him, that, to avoid an ignominious death, he was obliged to abscond, and fly into Ireland; and Yrick, the son of Harold, A. D. 952, was placed on the throne<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 375, 376.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There was a coalition of parties in this new election, which promised some sta∣bility; but at length Anlaf's friends headed a renewed faction in his favour. En∣raged at the repeated perfidy of this province, Edred, seeing the division favoured his measures, marched northward, threatening to desolate the whole country, and put the inhabitants to the sword<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Flor. Virg. p. 604.</NOTE>; and, as an earnest of his vengeance, marked his progress with utter destruction. Fordun says, that Edred was assisted by Mal∣colm king of Scotland; but this stands unsupported. At the sovereign's appear∣ance in the heart of the country, Yrick fled into Scotland, and the inhabitants, in the most abject submission, prostrated themselves for mercy, presented rich
<PB N="72" REF="117"/>gifts, and took a most solemn oath of allegiance. It appears that Wulstan, arch∣bishop of York, and the Northumbrian nobles, swore fealty to Edred, in a town the ancient writers call Taddens-cliff, now Topcliff.</P>
<P>Edred, not dreading any treachery, returned towards Wessex with his army, in detached parties. Florence, alone, says, the Northumbrians, immediately on Ed∣red's retreat, raised to the throne one Incus, of Danish extraction: But nothing further is said of him. Certain it is they ran to arms, and, by forced marches, pursued the English army, and fell upon their rear. Also, by several ambuscades, they greatly harrassed the detached parties; and had it not been for the valour, conduct, and resolution of the king, his whole army, by this unexpected attack disunited and thrown into confusion, would have been cut to pieces before they could have made a regular stand. At length, by the greatest exertions, the king's army recovered its order, and put the Northumbrians to flight. Enraged at the repeated villainy of the Danes, the king returned towards Northumberland, de∣termined to execute his former threats, and lay waste the whole territory. His march spread horror and dismay on every hand: They beheld the avenger advan∣cing with fire and sword, to take his fill of slaughter, and lay the whole country in ashes. Unable to resist, deprived of every claim to compassion, branded for breach of sacred compacts and oaths, they had no resource left but absolute submission to the king, on such terms as his justice and clemency should impose, slavery being now their forlorn hope. The first step was to renounce, by the most solemn acts, their allegiance to Yrick, and hang up Amac, the son of An∣laf, as a public traitor, to whose persuasions they attributed their revolt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Scala Chron. v. ii. —Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 523.</NOTE>. Wul∣stan, archbishop of York, was seized and thrown into prison for abetting the in∣surgents; and some other striking examples were made. The king's compassion and humanity were powerfully assailed by such abjectness of submission as the prostrate people displayed: These were mixed with the lamentations of women forlorn, and naked children. He possessed a heart flowing with benevolence, and his eyes turned away from bloodshed with tears. The felicity of mankind touch∣ed his soul wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more exquisite joy than all the pageantry of victories and tri∣umphs. He took the people to his mercy: They surrendered their places of strength, which he filled with garrisons of English. He placed a number of troops in the towns, to check sedition, and keep the inhabitants in due subordination: He divested them of all ensigns of royalty, and abolished regal jurisdiction. He reduced Northumberland into a province, over which he placed Osulf, governor, dependent entirely on his crown, and gave him the title and dignity of an earl. He released the bishop, and pardoned him; and extended his clemency to other chiess in the faction, establishing a lasting peace<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 376.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Edred sullied the glories of his reign by yielding too much to the influence of Dunstan, abbot of Glastonbury, and too great zeal in the affairs of religion. He possessed the crown ten years, and died A. D. 955, leaving two infant sons, nei∣ther of whom succeeded him; Edwy his nephew, son of Edmund, being placed on the throne.</P>
<PB N="73" REF="118"/>
<P>Although he began his reign at so early an age as fourteen years, he shewed a bold dislike to the manners of Dunstan, and the enormous growth of church influ¦ence which appeared in the former reign. It is evident his judgment in those matters, though just, was attended with too much of the rashness and impetu∣osity of youth. The clergy had possessed the consciences of the people; acts of devotion and piety were become deeply tinctured with superstition and enthusiasm: The sacredness of religious houses and monastic orders had encreased into that re∣verence, that, to speak against them in the ear of the people, was accounted im∣pious and prophane. A burning zeal existed towards the ministers and rights of religion. The young king did not sufficiently estimate this influence, and the danger which would attend any attempt to shake it. He knew not what a tre∣mendous enemy he was rousing when he opposed this hydra of power. He con∣ceived not the secret channels by which the foe he was braving would conduct the opposition; and such it was that along with it was promulged, to the alarmed con∣sciences of men, who received the monks to their closet, that it was rendering a service to God to remove those who were obnoxious to his religion and church. It was not long before a faction appeared in Mercia, agitated by the monks, who were deprived of the benefices Dunstan procured them, by removal of the secu∣lar clergy, now restored. In the popular cry, the king was represented as the most impious of men; and at the head of the malcontents Edgar his brother ap∣peared, under the denomination of <HI>Protector of the Church:</HI> A title replete with a thousand horrors, specious and delusive, calculated to seduce the zealot and en∣thusiast. Having secured Mercia, he gained over to his cause the debased race of Danes in East-Anglia and Northumberland, who, not for the cause of religion, but from a habit of wickedness, and being ripe for evil deeds, appeared in arms in his favour. Edwy, astonished at the rebellion, stood dismayed: He had not infringed the laws, oppressed the people, or injured his brother. His conscience was void of offence, save only in his opposition to the enormity of the ecclesias∣tic power. He did not accuse himself of giving cause for the insurrection; nei∣ther did he apprehend the religious had sufficient influence to create the tumult which on every hand surrounded him. Not willing to occasion any effusion of blood in such a contest, he was content in securing the faithful kingdom of Wes∣sex to himself, and surrendered the rest to his brother.</P>
<P>Some of the monastic writers charge Edwy with abundant wickedness; others only accuse him of a lascivious habit; but the most judicious of the moderns say, his fame and misfortunes were equally derived from the monks. His mind, distressed with the reverse of fortune, and wounded by injuries he did not me∣rit, his conscious rectitude of mind representing his actions and intentions to∣wards the church as replete with political justice towards his people, overwhelmed him with melancholy, which hastened on his dissolution; and, after a reign of four years and some few months, he departed this life in the year 959.</P>
<P>Edgar now assumed the diadem of England, and was scarce advanced to the age of sixteen years when he ascended the throne of the united kingdoms. He was a favourer of the monks, from whose flattery he derived the appellation of <HI>the
<PB N="74" REF="119"/>Peaceable;</HI> blest also with the title of <HI>Protector of the Church.</HI> He recalled Dun∣stan from a voluntary exile, to which he submitted himself in Edwy's reign, and gave him the See of Worcester. Under this bishop's influence or administration, the state was kept in peace, not by passive and weaker measures, but the wisdom and vigour displayed in the several departments of government. He held the array in continual exercise of arms, so as to be ready, on the shortest notice, to bring a very formidable army into the field, thereby keeping up respect from the neighbouring potentates. In the northern provinces he kept the fortified places and towns filled with well disciplined troops, by which the Danes were held in awe. He had a powerful navy, said to exceed 4000 vessels, distributed in all the ports of the island, and at intervals cruising on the coasts, to the destruction of piracy, and safe-guard of the kingdom, against descents of a foreign enemy. These were sufficient to keep him superior to all the other princes of the island, who are said to have made him a voluntary submission. His attention was also engaged to the promotion of agriculture; and to him the kingdom was indebted for the extirpation of wolves, which were destructive to the more northern parts in particular, being not only mountainous, but covered with extensive forests. This he chiefly effected, by publishing an act of grace and remission to offenders, on their bringing in a number of wolves tongues, apportioned to their offences. He redressed the grievances of the people, by punishing the civil officers who transgressed the law, and relieved them by a dispensation of impartial justice; to which end he frequently visited the several districts, and received complaints from all ranks of men, with a distinguished humanity.</P>
<P>Dunstan's character as a minister of state was very great; but, as an ecclesiastic; severe and tyrannical. He, with the prince's power totally at his will, again ex∣cluded the seculars, and brought the regular clergy into benefices. Collier says, it is observable in the province of Northumberland in general, and in the posses∣sions of St Cuthbert in particular, no monks were then introduced into religious foundations; nay, they were not admitted there till after the Norman conquest: So that he does not give the fraternity of Lindisfarne or Chester that denomi∣nation.</P>
<P>During Edgar's peaceful reign, our prelate departed this life, in the year 968<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Angl. Sacra, p. 701.—Sym. Dun. p. 138.</NOTE>, and was succeeded by ELFSIG, who was consecrated at York by Archbishop Osketill, and held the See for twenty-two years.</P>
<P>The same political principles from whence such prudent regulations, touching other parts of the state, were derived, produced one equally wise relative to the province of Northumberland<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Chr. J. Wal. p. 544.</NOTE>. It appeared that the earldom of this exten∣sive territory was an office of too great power to stand consistent with the due
<PB N="75" REF="120"/>subordination of the subject, by which the springs of government were to ope∣rate to the protection of the whole. The king therefore thought proper to divide Northumberland into two earldoms; to effect which purpose, he called a council of the barons of that province at York; where the matter being deliberated upon, and it being demonstrated to the assembly, that the division would conduce to the better protection of the northern territories, it was determined on Osulf's death, which happened about the time of this resolution, that Oslac should be made earl of the country between Humber and Tees; and the government of the district north of Tees, to be bestowed on Eadulf.</P>
<P>Edgar's political history is full of honour; but his private story is blotted with impetuous passions, impatient to be gratified at the expence of justice, religion, and virtue. The monkish writers sanctify him with unbounded praises, in conse∣quence of the patronage he held out towards them in every channel. He depart∣ed this life in the year 975, in the 32d year of his age, leaving two sons and a daughter. His eldest son and successor, Edward, was born of a doubtful mar∣riage; some say he was the issue of a concubine.</P>
<P>The new establishment of two earldoms took place without any resistance or op∣position, all such being totally suspended by the strict civil administration, and mi∣litary power of Edgar's government.</P>
<P>Soon after the bishop's coming to this See, Kenneth king of Scotland desired an interview with his illustrious brother the king of England, of whose greatness and magnificence he had an anxious wish to be a spectator. To this purpose the English monarch commanded the two earls of Northumberland, and Elfsig the bishop, to conduct Kenneth to his court, where he met with such cordiality and hospitable reception, as occasioned an amicable treaty to take place, in which the Lothians, ancient appendages of the crown of Scotland, were surrendered up, and ever after united to that kingdom.</P>
<P>Edward was only fourteen years of age when he was crowned king of England. On his accession great dissentions appeared touching the succession, and a nume∣rous party openly declared against him; but, being supported by the church, with Dunstan at their head, he was seated on the throne. It gave distress to many of the nobles to behold the kingdom under the government of that haughty pre∣late again, who had multiplied his deeds of absolute power with his years: But, now holding the regency, and the same rules of government established in Edgar's reign being supported, this was no season to struggle against the encreasing evils. All the church regulations of this short reign were in favour of the monks: In civil government we hear of no changes, or improvement of laws<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i. p. 330.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This prince's miserable death, by assassination, took place in the fifth year of his reign; the horrid circumstances of which stamp the age with an infamous stigma. From the tears and affection of the church, he was stiled saint and martyr, though his murder had not the least relation to any religious opinion<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Edward passing one day, as he was returning from hunting, near Corf Castle, where his mother-in-law Elsrida resided with her son Ethelred, rode off from his company, in order to pay her a visit.

<P>In the year 970, Ethelred, Edgar's son by Elfrida, ascended the throne, and was crowned by bishop Dunstan when he was about twelve years of age.</P>
<P>It is not important to that locality which gives such narrow bounds to this work, to pass through all the vicissitudes of circumstances and events which at∣tended the first years of the young king's reign. It must suffice to say, that church authority began to wane when bishop Dunstan left the world; and the Danes, by repeated descents, distracted the southern provinces of the kingdom. The king is represented as an abject coward<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Maims.</NOTE>, supine, and overwhelmed in the sluggishness of a weak mind possessed by avarice, and totally divested of every principle of virtue and honour. Under such a prince, it is not astonishing that the reins of government should be relaxed, military spirit languish, and anarchy be seen making prevalent strides towards universal confusion; or that armies should fly before the enemy; that commanders should be treacherous; and mini∣sters, with the most abject ignorance, or the most depraved corruption, push on measures unconstitutional, impolitic, and destructive. Such were the calamities which marked this unhappy aera. The annals of Edgar were yet recent and in memory, in which not only Peace cultivated her olives, but also military ardour planted young laurels, which spread themselves over the palaces of princes. The sovereigns of Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Man, and the Isles, were his dependents, without the coercion of the sword. It is not necessary that the laurel should be nourished by blood: It flourishes in the regions of virtue; and honour conquers more than the sword.</P>
<P>Elfsig<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Angl. Sacra, p. 701.—Sym. Dun. p. 138.</NOTE>, having presided over the See of Chester for more than twenty-two years, departed this life in the year 990, and was succeeded by ALDUNE, who came to the See in a most unhappy aera; for, besides the inauspicious charac∣ter of the king, such troubles were impending, as this island had not yet experi∣enced, although its earlier history is stained with so much bloodshed and dis∣tress.</P>
<P>The Danes, having desisted for some time from their acts of piracy and rapine, made the English conclude other pursuits had engaged their attention. But, alas! this interval of peace was merely delusive, and filled with vain hopes; for the
<PB N="77" REF="122"/>year next succeeding the bishop's consecration, with a numerous army, they landed on the southern coasts of Britain. The king intimidated, without power to re∣sist, or wisdom to avoid the wretchedness which ensued; without an army, with∣out fortitude of mind, and every other aid the exigency required, had recourse to the councils of Syric archbishop of Canterbury, who, with as little foresight as his sovereign, advised a large sum of money to be given to the invaders, to stop their depredations, and quit the land. This project had not only its imme∣diate effect, but also its certain consequence; for, though the present evil was re∣lieved, the rich bait induced new armies of necessitous wretches to seek the gold∣en shores from whence their countrymen returned enriched. Within two years, another fleet appeared, and landed troops on the north side of Humber. They made grievous depredations on the province of Northumberland, assailed and took the castle of Bebbanburg, where they found much treasure; and, after plundering it of every thing valuable, destroyed and defaced as much of the works as they could<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hoveden—Lel. Col. v. iii.</NOTE>. In this descent, the unhappy consequence of having leaders of foreign extraction or connections was demonstrated; for, when a large army of English were drawn up in order of battle, to oppose the invaders, the command∣ers turned their backs, left the field to their countrymen, and the troops to be cut down or dispersed by the enemy. On this occasion, the former mode of pacifying the invaders was again renewed. We are not told whether the See of Chester suffered any thing by this invasion.</P>
<P>In the year 995, Sweyn king of Denmark, and Olaus king of Norway, allu∣red by the accounts of English wealth, and the total relaxation of military spirit, which those who had lately visited the island perceived to prevail with the inhabi∣tants, were desirous of partaking in the lucrative expeditions their countrymen had experienced; with a powerful fleet they entered the Thames, and from thence, spreading themselves into divers parts, gathered much plunder and spoil. It seems that a party of the invaders infested the northern coasts at the same time, which induced bishop Aldune, with the whole body of religious settled at Chester, toge∣ther with their vassals and dependents, to quit that place, and travel to Ripon, carrying with them the remains of St Cuthbert, the holy relics, and riches of the church; and also their cattle, goods, and effects.</P>
<P>The See, which had been settled at Chester for 113 years, was for ever removed from thence, and that place totally deprived of all the wealth and honour depend∣ent thereon. The incessant troubles which distracted the province of Northum∣berland from the time the See was first settled at Chester, give little prospect of any considerable advancement having taken place in literature, arts, sciences, or manufactures, during that period; nor of the bishops having been distinguished for learning, peculiar acts of piety, or good works. The rights of the church were not invaded, and the society of ecclesiastics in the monastery contented themselves in the exercise of their religious function, and the tranquil enjoyments of the cloister. The laws which were ordained, and had peculiar direction to the vices of this province, do not prove, that, even in the uncultivated ferocity of
<PB N="78" REF="123"/>many of the inhabitants, they were guilty of more enormous crimes than the people of other parts of England. Architecture had gained few improvements. Alfred first reformed the buildings, by substituting stone and brick edifices for those of wood, wattlings, and mud, which were the only materials in general use before his time. Yet it does not appear, that even this improvement had ta∣ken place in the north; for the church of Chester was built of wood. Upon the whole, the intercourse with the Danes seems to have introduced nothing but evil; they appear to have been mere savages, barbarous in their manners, fero∣cious and uncultivated; and, like a troop of wolves, came upon the distracted villages, carrying nothing but desolation and horror in their progress. If they brought no benefits which have survived to posterity, they have left us one memo∣rial of their execrable existence, the dregs of a guttural language; than which the tongues of Africa, and the coasts of Guinea, or of the wild nations of Ame∣rica, are not more disgusting.</P>
<P>Ethelred, who had no more conduct than courage, not knowing how to put a stop to the ravages the Danes were committing, had recourse to the same expe∣dient made use of on the like occasion, and bound himself by treaty to pay them a large sum of money, as it is said, not less than 16,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sax.

The tax for raising the money thus appropriated, was called <HI>the Danegelt;</HI> which, it is observable, the clergy and monks always found means to elude<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rapin.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>During the interval of peace, the bishop, with his whole train of attendants, took up the holy relics, their herds and flocks, and all their effects, and left Ripon, intending to return to Chester, after an absence from that church of about four months. As they approached the ground where Durham now stands, by a mira∣culous interposition, the monkish writers tell us, the carriage on which the body of St Cuthbert, with the other relics, were born, became immoveable, at a place to the eastward of the present city, called Wrdelau. From this miraculous re∣sistance the ecclesiastics determined Heaven would not permit the Saint to return to his former resting-place. Yet they remained ignorant of the situation appoint∣ed to receive their holy charge. The ground where they then sojourned, did not seem suitable to the residence of so numerous a body of attendants, being in the middle of a plain or open field, and a place uninhabitable. Such is the de∣scription given of it<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 139, 140, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The bishop admonished his company, that they should fast and pray until the will of Heaven was revealed. Accordingly, after much pious abstinence, self-denial, and prayer, Eadmer, one of the most favoured of the at∣tendants, received the revelation, and Dunhelme was pronounced the place de∣creed by the Powers above for she holy Saint's rest on earth. Tradition says, the place, by the revealed name, was wholly unknown to the bishop and his attend∣ants, who wandered about for some time in search of it; and that the discovery was accidentally made by a woman's enquiries after her cow, which strayed in Dunholme. The ancients had much superstition touching the foundation of cities: A sow and pigs was the omen which distinguished the ground the deities ordained
<PB N="79" REF="124"/>should receive the first foundation of Rome: A more beneficent animal Nature could not have produced than a cow, to point out the seat of this rich See. Though this story is not recorded in any of the monastic writers, yet it receives some credit from the sculpture on one of the towers of the present cathedral, where the cow is represented with her attendants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. iv. p. 39. v. vi. Vide Muggleswick, v. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A mount towards the eastern coast, called Wardenlaw, is presumed to be the Saint's resting-place; but being near the coast, and a very few miles from Were∣mouth, could not be called an uninhabitable station. Weremouth was well known to the religious of Chester: Besides, it is wonderful how the bishop and his fol∣lowers, with their cattle and servants, in coming from Ripon, should pass down that part of the country. Symeon gives the name, Wrdelau; and Leland, in a note to an extract from one of the monastic authors, not named, <HI>De episcopis Lindisfarn. &amp; Dunelmensis.</HI> Col. v. ii. p. 330, says, <Q><HI>Nunc Wadele, ubi Aedes olim “”monachis recreandi gratiâ concessoe.</HI></Q> The name Leland gives, is not happier than Symeon's, and is as little known. It appears by the foregoing, that the monks had here a <HI>camera,</HI> as erections, of the like nature, are stiled in the church re∣cords, being places of summer relaxation, and retreats for country recreation<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i. p. 330.</NOTE>. Places of royal residence were stiled, <HI>cameroe;</HI> "Londinum camera regis Angliae<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Selden, Mar. Claus. 2.22.</NOTE>." It seems doubtful from hence, that the mount called Warden-Law is not the place, as there are no traces of any erection there. Leland's term, Wadele, supposing it the mode of pronouncing it, Wardale, is too diffuse to give any help. To fix upon the place, the reader must therefore be left to those conjectures which he will find in the sequel, under the description of Durham, and its environs.</P>
<P>No sooner had the bishop received this divine revelation, than he, with his fol∣lowers, advanced with thanksgivings and much joy to the appointed place; where, to shelter the holy relics for the present, they erected a small<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Now St Mary's.</NOTE> church of wood, called De-virgis; after which they erected a more complete edifice, con∣structed after the general order of buildings at that time, of posts wattled with branches of trees, and covered with a compost of clay and cut straw, or perhaps lime, and it was called White-Church<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 142. 145.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Symeon and other writers have given the following description of the place: <Q>“That Dunhelm was a place strong by nature, but not easily rendered habitable, as it was overgrown by a thick forest: In the midst was a small plain, which had ”been used in tillage.</Q> The name, most authors have conceived, is compounded of <HI>dun</HI> and <HI>helm,</HI> and that their etymology is expressive of the nature<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dunum-Dunseti,</HI> mons, mon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iculae.

<PB N="80" REF="125"/>The acceptation of the word <HI>holme</HI> at present is, to denote a low situation, plain, or valley. <HI>Helm</HI> is a Saxon word for armour, or defence to the head; in French, <HI>heaume,</HI> and Italian, <HI>elmo;</HI> and most possibly in this case the word <HI>helm,</HI> annexed to <HI>dun,</HI> denominates some works of defence; as Ravensworth-Castle, in ancient records, is called Ravens-Helm; and other strong places which may be brought in inference. The lofty mount on which the octagon tower of the castle now stands, has the countenance of great antiquity. The word <HI>helm,</HI> in the present accepta∣tion of the northern counties, denotes a shed or shelter; and it is not impossible, indeed, but the name arose from the <HI>helm-de-virgis,</HI> which the ecclesiastics first erected to shelter their holy relics. In an old book, mentioned by Leland in his Collectanea, called Bibliotheca Eliotae, it is said, that <Q>Donum is a county in “”England called Durham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. iv. p. 136.</NOTE>;</Q> or it may come from Saxon derivation, Deo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ham, the city given to God, or God's city. If the ground, being a free gift, gave occasion for its name, no need to seek for distant etymologies, but recon∣cile Symeon's way of writing it into a corruption. In many instances in more modern times, it is wrote Duresme, which corresponds with the present name, making therein the letter <HI>s</HI> a liquid, and <HI>h</HI> a mute, though it precedes a vowel, yet an unsounding letter in Durham<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Symeon, p. 144. 145.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the year 995, the translation of St Cuthbert took place, and three years af∣ter raising the little tabernacle of wood, or the <HI>Alba Ecclesia,</HI> a church of stone having been begun and dedicated by the good bishop, the remains were deposit∣ed there. Symeon says, with the assistance of all the people, Uchtred earl of Northumberland giving aid therein, the forest was soon destroyed, the ground cleared of wood, and rendered habitable. The whole inhabitants between Coquet river and Tees are described as contributing to these works. The new church was dedicated by Aldune, "pridie nonas Septembris," being the fourth day of September, A. D. 999; and the body of St Cuthbert was placed therein with much solemnity and holy joy<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Symeon, p. 148.</NOTE>. The bishop did not live to complete this edifice, though he survived the time of dedication eighteen years; for the west tower was left for his successor to finish. Symeon's saying that earl Uchtred aided the work, confounds the chronology of other historians, who relate, that Eadulph earl of Northumberland was succeeded by Waltheof the elder, who was Uchtred's fa∣ther. But in that age of distress and confusion, and after two earls had been appointed upon a division of the province of Northumberland, it is no wonder such contradictions are found. Hoveden, and the Melros Chronicle, make Wal∣theof successor of Osulf, and do not name Eadulph.</P>
<P>The possessions the bishop brought with the See to Dunhelm, modernly called Durham, were the same as possessed at Chester, Lindisfarne, Norham, Bedling∣ton, Warkworth, and the whole territory between Were and Tyne<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. It will ap∣pear in the sequel, that the royal grant of Guthred, confirmed by Alfred, was not extended further than the river Were towards the south; and it will be shewn, that the earldom of Sadberg was constantly held separate, and was in the crown
<PB N="81" REF="126"/>at the time of K. Rich. II., the wapentake extending from Hartlepool, almost to the head of the river Tees, and including a great width of country; and that, by several successive donations, parcels of the remaining part of that tract of coun∣try between Tees and Were became the possessions of the church. Billingham and Gainford were early granted; but, as before shewn, were forcibly with-held from the See.</P>
<P>In the presence of the king at York, archbishop Wulstan, and Aldune bishop of Durham, with many others of the chief personages of the realm, Styr, the son of Ulphus, gave to St Cuthbert, Darlington with its appendages, toge∣ther with lands in Conisclisse, Cockerton, Haughton. Normanby, and Seaton. Also, about the same time, Snaculf, the son of Cykell, gave Bradbury, Mor∣don, Socburn, and Griseby, with the appendent privileges of Saca and Socne, all south-east of the river Were<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel.

<P>The monastic writers name certain lands and tenements which the bishops of Lindisfarne and Chester, in the times of public calamity, yielded up to the earls of Northumberland; of which, Aldune is said to have resigned twenty-four vil∣las, as an aid towards prosecuting the wars of those times; but which the earls did not afterwards restore to the church. They are thus named to us:—Gegen∣forde (Gainsord), which bishop Egred founded and gave to St Cuthbert: Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or∣ningtun, and otherwise wrote Cueorvington, (Snotterton); Sliddenesse, alias Slid∣desness (Sledwish); Marawnda, alias Marawuda (Marwood); Staunton, alias Stan∣tun (Stainton); Stretlea (Streatlam); Cletlinga (Cleatlam); Langudun, alias Langatun (Langton); Mortun (Morton Tinmouth); Persebrige (Persebridge); II Aclit (Two Aycliffs); Cop-land (Copley); Bincestre (Binchester); Ticlea, alias Tutelea (Thickley); Ediscum (Escomb); Wudetun, alias Wuddetun (Woodham); Hunewic (Hunwick); Neowatun, alias Newatun (Newton); and Helme (Helm): These were north of Tees, and south of Were: Weardsettle, alias Weardesfesde (Worsall); Bereford (Barford); Stretfird, alias Stredford (Startforth); Lirting∣tun, alias Lyrtingtun (Lartington); Cuthberttun, alias Cuthbertestun (Cotherston); on the south side of Tees. It is not said when or by whom the last mentioned lands were granted to the church, Gainsord excepted; and it must be observed, that had the ancient royal grants comprehended the whole territory between Tees and Tyne, the smaller donations before noted would not have been made<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel.

<P>Aldune held jurisdiction over the church of Hexham, and nominated thereto, as appears by various testimony<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 378.</NOTE>. No account of any exercise of civil jurisdic∣tion to this period, other than that right of judicature which the thanes or barons, and lords of manors, held of Sac and Soc, with Insangtheof; nor even of the due execution of those powers by the bishops. Selden, in his titles of honour, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>41, says, That the counsel of Anthony Beke bishop of Durham, in his assign∣ing of errors in parliament, upon a judgment of seizing his liberties, given against him by the justices in eyre of Northumberland, under K.

Symeon, one may rest assured, would omit no evidence to aggrandize the church, and he never notices it.</P>
<P>Whilst the bishop and his convent were settling matters relative to their church at Durham, Ethelred encountered innumerable embarrassments with domestic, as well as foreign enemies, but particularly from the Danish invasions. Ethelred, complaining that Cumberland had not aided him against those invaders, or contri∣buted its proportion of money towards the sums granted them, agreeable to treaty, marched a powerful army into that country, where he committed those ravages which disgrace the age. The most uncivilized nations were never more rapacious, inhuman and revengeful; even carrying the natives into slavery, like the horrid trade on the coasts of Guinea, was a familiar practice: Butchering, maiming, and whatever dreadful names have been given to cruelty, were exercised: Sacking, pillaging, burning, and laying desolate a miserable country, marked the unhappy progress of such armies. But Ethelred's expedition was confined to a narrow province, and was soon revenged upon his own territories. The Danes, returning from an expedition against Normandy, over-ran many of the richest parts of England, collecting a great booty. The timorous prince, surrounded by distracted councils, deserted by many of his subjects, who would not fight against the invaders, or secretly abetted them, himself inconstant of mind, and divested of every military habit, had recourse to the former expedient, and granted them a premium of 30,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR>, an immense sum in those days, for restoring peace to his subjects, and withdrawing their armies from the country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the payment of this money, every hide of land was taxed yearly twelve pence; or, as some au∣thors say, two shillings<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Sir Henry Spellman in his Glossary, p. 292, makes the number of hides in England amount to 243,600; conse∣quently the gross produce of this tax, at 25. per hide, would, at that rate, amount to 24,360<ABBR>l.</ABBR>; a very great sum to be annually raised at that period.

Bede reckons it as much as will maintain a family. Some say it was an hundred acres; others, that it contained no certain number of acres. The distribution of England by hides of land is very ancient, mention being made of it in the laws of Ina. <HI>Dane gelt</HI> was the first land-tax in England. It was after∣wards called <HI>hidagium,</HI> which name remained afterwards upon all taxes and subsidies imposed on lands. The Normans called these sometimes <HI>taxes,</HI> sometimes <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>allages,</HI> and <HI>auxilia</HI> and <HI>subsidia.</HI> The Saxon kings be∣fore this, had their levies of money, and personal services, towards the building and repairing cities, castles, bridges, military expeditions, &amp;c. which, from the word <HI>bote.</HI> that is, repair, were termed <HI>burgbote, brig∣bote b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>regeld,</HI> &amp;c. The Dane-gelt was released by K. Edward the Confessor, but levied again by K. Wil. I. &amp; II., K. Hen. I. and Stephen, and continued to be collected as low as the 21st Hen. II., and probably later. This ancient tax was a precedent for our land-tax.—V. Leg. Edw. Confess. c. 12.</NOTE> The Saxon Annals, Hoveden<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 429.</NOTE> Matthew of Westminster<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mat. West. p. 386.</NOTE> and several other autho∣rities, assert, that it was done by the advice of the Wittenagemote, or great coun∣cil of the state. Although the chief body of the Danes quitted the country, yet many remained, and settled here, joining their countrymen in East-Anglia and Northumberland, obtaining possessions in land; and, wherever they were disper∣sed, such was their insolence, and the fear the natives had of their pride and
<PB N="83" REF="128"/>cruelty, that they obtained the name of <HI>Lord Danes:</HI> A denomination that car∣ried detestation with it to the suffering inhabitants, whose toils were exerted to raise the Dane-gelt, and perform the services those task-masters imposed on the vassals of their lands, without mercy.</P>
<P>Ethelred's queen dying, he married Emma, sister of Richard, second duke of Normandy; which alliance giving him hope of succour and defence against the fo∣reign invaders, he is said to have projected the cowardly and brutal massacre of the Danes which shortly ensued<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To execute this project, orders were conveyed so privately throughout the kingdom, that, in one day, all the Danes were slain with such implacable fury and cruelty, that the particulars cannot be read without horror. Sweyn's sister, for her beauty called the <HI>Pearl of Normandy,</HI> who was married to an English lord, having at first been spared, Ethelred was so barbarous, as to cause her children to be murdered in her presence, and then her head to be cut off. This bloody tragedy was acted on the 13th November 1002. It was greatly similar to the massacre of the Romans by the Britons under Boadicea: Not only the like barbari∣ties, but the same consequences, attended both.—Sax. Ann. Huntingd. Mat. of West. Rapin, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The unhappy project was attended with so many unpropitious circumstances, and brought on so many deplorable consequen∣ces, that it astonishes the mind, touched with tender feelings, how it could ever enter into the devices of a Christian heart. But cruelty and cowardice are inse∣parable. Sweyn king of Denmark received intelligence of this bloody catastrophe by some emissary from England; for the murderous sword could not possibly be extended over Northumberland, where the greatest part of the inhabitants were Danes. In abhorrence of so barbarous an act, and in revenge of the death of his sister, whose fate was peculiarly severe, he projected an expedition against England, the old motive of plunder and pillage being only secondary in this tran∣saction, which originated in a vow of vengeance, and to correct a prince and people whose hands were embrued in innocent blood. With 300 sail of ships he approached the shores of Cornwall, and landed his troops there. He marched his army to Exeter, reduced the town to ashes, and put the inhabitants to the sword, as an example he proposed to follow in his progress. He pillaged and destroyed a large tract of country, without opposition. At length the king's ar∣my, under the command of Alfric duke of Mercia, opposed him; and the battle array was formed, when the English leader, in resentment of injuries he had formerly suffered from the king, betrayed his trust, deserted his troops, suffered the army to be routed and dispersed for want of a commander, and gave up the country to be wasted and depopulated by the enemy. Sweyn employed the rest of the summer in pursuing his warfare; but, before the winter storms set in, with∣drew his troops, and departed for Denmark. He returned in spring, landed his army in East-Anglia, and began his operations by destroying Norwich. He was opposed by a body of English, and, with great loss and difficulty, claimed the victory. Providence was against the king; he miscarried in every attempt. His folly was not greater than his cruelty, which, through private acts of severity, weaned many of his nobles from their allegiance. His councils were dissentaneous and distracted; his courtiers false; his commanders and chiefs treacherous and disloyal; and his people abject and dispirited. Amidst all the public calamities, and the diffidence in those who should support the state, it is astonishing that the
<PB N="84" REF="129"/>avarice of the clergy, and particularly of the monks, very much helped to en∣crease the distresses of the kingdom: For, notwithstanding their great riches, they refused to contribute their proportion of money necessary for the defence of the crown, pleading their privileges and immunities, as if they had no share in the danger. An ensuing famine drove the Danes from the land, and gave the miser∣able people a respite from war, only to perish by want.</P>
<P>The calamities of the country being relieved by the ensuing harvest, the Danes renewed their descent near Sandwich, and wintered in the Isle of Thanet. Ethel∣red had no expedient to relieve his country from the plunderers, but by agreeing to pay them the like sum of 30,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> The Danes, from the repetition of those compositions, at length claimed an annual tribute from England. It would be a melancholy recapitulation to go through the succession of calamities which befel this country during Ethelred's reign: It suffices to say, that such was the power gained by Sweyn king of Denmark in the year 1013, that Ethelred, besieged in London, with some difficulty escaped with a few faithful attendants to Nor∣mandy; soon after which Sweyn was proclaimed king of England. From the authority of Godwin it appears, that, in these times of public calamity, one bishop had the care of the education of the king's sons, Alfred and Edward, born of Emma, his second queen; and that he attended them with their mother into Normandy, where he left them under the protection of duke Richard, their uncle. How this act of pious duty was relished by the usurper, is not said; and indeed the fact seems doubtful from the hazard the church was in from such a daring piece of virtue, which militated so powerfully against Sweyn's hopes of establishing the suc∣cession to his own issue.</P>
<P>Sweyn exercised no other remarkable act of authority but the imposition of a grievous tax upon the country for payment of his troops; for, either by poison or accidental death, he did not enjoy his conquest the space of one year, and was never crowned king of these dominions. On Sweyn's death, the Danes proclaim∣ed Canute, his son, king; but the English recalled Ethelred, the short experience they had of Danish government being intolerable.</P>
<P>The king, on his restoration, did not display any examples that the corrections received in the school of adversity had gained him wisdom; for his first attention was to revenge, upon part of his subjects, an affront he conceived they had of∣fered him; and it was only a secondary consideration with him, that he had to op∣pose his people's enemy. Canute did not think it expedient, at that crisis, to op∣pose the king's army; but, by a regular and well-conducted retreat, he brought his troops to the sea-shore, and embarked them for Denmark. The Danish his∣tory says, that Canute's younger brother, being left regent, on the death of his father usurped the throne, which obliged Canute to repair immediately to his own country, to recover his inheritance, and the crown of his ancestors: That busi∣ness being effected, he returned with his victorious army to England, and landed at Sandwich, to assert his right to his father's conquests. Strange dissentions ap∣peared in the king's party; the army would not move, unless headed by their so∣vereign, who, in abject cowardice, feigned sickness, and shut himself up in Lon∣don.
<PB N="85" REF="130"/>Though the king's son Edmund, who had much knowledge and personal courage, used every effort to win the troops to the field of honour, on the king's not appearing to command them, they disbanded themselves, and returned home.</P>
<P>A second army was levied; but though the king was induced by his son to ap∣pear at their head, he had not courage to lead them against the enemy, pretend∣ing he feared some treachery devised to surrender him into the hands of his foe. At length, he withdrew from the army, and got privately into London. Ed∣mund, under these discouraging circumstances, retired into the north, and joined himself to Uchtred earl of Northumberland, who married his sister Edgina: But, after some weak efforts in the northern districts, Uchtred was obliged to submit himself to Canute, and Edmund got secretly into London. Such a complication of misfortunes, with so weak a mind as Ethelred displayed, at length brought him into a languishing state of health, and, in the year 1016, he departed this life in London, in the 50th year of his age, and 37th of his reign; leaving his kingdom in the most deplorable state that any country or people ever expe∣rienced.</P>
<P>Edmund, his eldest son, who, from his robust form and manly courage, was surnamed <HI>Ironside,</HI> was proclaimed king. Under this succession, after many se∣vere struggles, London being thrice besieged, and as often repulsed the besiegers; and the young king having experienced the repeated treacheries of Edric Streon, the infamous duke of Mercia, his brother-in-law, a treaty of peace was con∣cluded, by which Mercia, East-Anglia, and Northumberland, were consigned to Canute; and Edmund held the rest of England. But this peace had not sub∣sisted long before Edmund suffered death by assassination, and the contrivance of the duke of Mercia, he not having accomplished the first year of his reign, leaving two sons of tender years.</P>
<P>On Edmund's demise, Canute insisting it was a provision of the compact made on the division of the kingdom, that the survivor should possess the whole, and his power being irresistible, though his allegation was esteemed a mere contrivance, the nobles thought it expedient to submit to his claim: He was therefore pro∣claimed, and soon after crowned king of all England.</P>
<P>Having taken a short view of the state at large, it is necessary to look back up∣on Northumberland, to remark the changes and events which took place there within the foregoing period. According to Symeon's account, Uchtred was earl of Northumberland when the See was translated to Durham, and the new church erected there. Rapin says, on Uchtred's submission to Canute, he was conti∣nued in his government, though but for a little while, as he plainly saw the earl had changed sides purely by compulsion, and had reason to fear he would not re∣main faithful; so he caused him to be put to death, and placed Eric, a Danish lord, in his room<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i. p. 142, 284, 325.</NOTE>. It is observable, this respectable author shews no authority for this relation. Afterwards, on Canute's being crowned king of all England, he says, that the king made Eric governor of Northumberland, on his division of
<PB N="86" REF="131"/>the country into four governments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Malms. l. ii. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Hunt.—Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Ann.</NOTE>; so that Eric's coming to the earldom, and Uchtred's death, appear not to take place till after Canute's coronation. From Hoveden<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hoved. p. 434.</NOTE>, and the Saxon Chronicle, it appears, that Uchtred's death was effect∣ed in this manner: He being required to attend Canute in person, to do homage, for which he had received the royal mandate of safe conduct, was notwithstanding assaulted in his passage, from an ambush laid for him by Turebrand, a noble and rich Dane<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Flor. and Hoved.</NOTE>, and slain, together with forty attendants; which crime was believed to have been perpetrated with the knowledge or connivance of the king<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. iii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Northumberland was distressed by incursions of the Scots. Ridpath, in his Bor∣der History, has the following relation. Malcolm king of Scotland made an in∣cursion into this province; and, committing great ravages therein, Waltheof their earl, debilitated with age, shut himself up in the castle of Bambrough; whilst Uchtred his son, a youth of great intrepidity, having assembled and armed a numerous body of Northumbrians, attacked and almost destroyed the Scots army; their king, with a few of his attendants, escaping with difficulty from the field of battle. In reward of this gallant and important service, Ethelred con∣ferred on Uchtred the earldom of his father, then living, adding to his jurisdic∣tion the southern division of Northumberland, again uniting the whole province in one earldom. This incursion most probably took place by way of reprisal for Ethelred's destroying Cumberland; as no other cause appears in history for the Scots to assist in aggravating the miseries of this reign. But the calamities pre∣pared for the Northumbrians by their northern foes did not cease there; for after Canute's coronation, Symeon says, that great distress having been predicted by a tremendous comet in the year 1718, the Scots, with a numerous army, entered the borders, and were opposed by the Northumbrians at Carrum, their army con∣sisting of all the fighting men between Tees and Tweed, with the nobility and chieftains of the greatest eminence and valour; an army as well the most nu∣merous as best accoutred and arrayed, that Northumberland, in any period of its history, had carried into the field, composed of the slower of those who held lands under the See of Durham. The Scots were victorious. The slaughter was dreadful, the greatest part of the Northumbrian army being cut to pieces. So greatly was this misfortune felt, that many parts of the country were almost depopulated by the fatal catastrophe. This battle, though mentioned by several authors, is placed in contrary and uncertain aeras: Such is the historical confusion of those times. Symeon says, that the good bishop was so greatly afflicted with the loss of so many of the chieftains and people of the lands of St Cuthbert, that, through unremitting grief, his health declined, and he departed this life in the year 1018, in the 29th year of his episcopacy, and the 24th after the translation of the See to Durham. He was said to be by birth noble; but nobler for his virtuous and holy life. If there is any foundation for supposing he had the tuition of queen Emma's children, he was rather singular in his purpose of putting them under the care of their uncle; few prelates, in those days of confusion, appearing to in∣termeddle
<PB N="87" REF="132"/>in matters of state. Whilst other ecclesiastics are said to have refused their aid to the crown, pleading the immunities of the church, it is said he re∣signed twenty-four villas to support the province of Northumberland with men. It is to be presumed, that the lands granted to the church were liable to furnish troops, as the fatal field of Carrum cut off so many of the people of St Cuch∣bert's territory. Before this instance, no positive mention is made of those people serving in war. It might, however, not be new or uncommon; but this is the first evidence that appears in history to evince it. The bishop's character was truly celebrated, as well for his religion as humility; beloved of all good men, both for wisdom and the excellence of his life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel.

<P>About the latter end of the 10th century, constitutions, or canons, were made for the regulation of the Northumbrian clergy, and other matters within the ec∣clesiastical jurisdiction, stiled, <HI>Northumbrensium Presbyterorum Leges.</HI> They bear no marks of the time when, or place where, they were made: Nor does it any where appear who was the author, or that they had the sanction of any regal au∣thority.

It appears by the 56th article, that they pecu∣liarly belonged to the province of York.

<P>After bishop Aldune's death, the See remained vacant for three years. Whar∣ton says, <HI>Propter tumultus bellicos.</HI> But the historians do not relate any circum∣stances of warfare or tumult in that period which might impede the election. Sy∣meon's words are: <Q>Defuncto Aldhuno episcopo, tribus pene annis aecclesia pas∣torali “destituebatur solatio. Cujus longam destitutionem hi qui in ea fuerant moleste ferentes, facto in unum conventu tractabant, quem ex sese ad episcopa∣tum ”eligere possent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 153.</NOTE>.</Q> It had been the custom from the first erection of the See, on the decease of their prelate, for the chapter to elect a successor, who was a monk; yet the religious body were secular clergy. They were perhaps anxious to appoint one of their own body to the episcopacy; and, from their divisions and delay, it seems there was not a man amongst them of such character as was eligible to that high function, consistent with the dignity and eminent virtues of those who had filled the See. Malmsbury says, it was usual before the Norman conquest, for the religious body in chapter, whether they were monks or preben∣daries, to elect the succeeding bishop.</P>
<P>Whilst the ecclesiastics sat in chapter to agitate this important subject, a priest called Eadmund<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 378.</NOTE>, descended of noble progenitors, but of a facetious character, entered the church, and being informed of the nature of their deliberations, and their divisions, in a jesting manner exclaims, "Why cannot you make me a bi∣shop!" The assembly, startled at the question, and knowing him to be a man of strict piety and religious virtue, received this interrogation in a more serious sense than he ever intended; for they conceived his coming there, and uttering these expressions, was by divine impulse. As many momentous concerns in that age were influenced by superstition, they determined, that thus the will of Hea∣ven had been pronounced to them, by an involuntary messenger, and all agreed in his election. Such was his humour, that it is said, at first he conceived the holy body, though met in solemn convention, were returning the jest upon him when he was told they had elected him. Being assured it was truth, he repented much of his facetiousness and jesting; would willingly have refused the no∣mination, and chosen to have enjoyed his secularity and benefice, with the plea∣sures of a life of liberty and ease, preferable to the solemnities and self-denial of the cowl; and the toil, religious care, and sacred burden of the episcopacy. Sy∣meon, according to the religious prejudices of those times, would not suffer the account of this election to pass to posterity without aggrandizing the event, by the relation of more miraculous circumstances. Accordingly he writes, that a confirmation of the act of the chapter was heard distinctly pronounced from the
<PB N="89" REF="134"/>shrine of St Cuthbert: After which they laid hands on Eadmund, and constrained him to take the government of the church.</P>
<P>In a short time after this election, Eadmund, in the most honourable manner, was presented to Canute, who approved and confirmed the act of the chapter, and commanded he should be consecrated. Eadmund had scruples yet remain∣ing; his predecessors were all monks, and he was not willing to possess the See, until he had taken on him the religious habit: There he first went through the ceremonies of the tonsure, and then was consecrated at Winchester by Wulstan archbishop of York. Symeon fixes his election in 1020, and his consecration in 1021<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 154.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Returning from Winchester, he visited the monastery of Peterborough, where meeting with Egelricus, a monk of strict church discipline, for whom he enter∣tained a great affection, induced him to attend him to Durham, where he resided to the time of our prelate's death, as his bosom friend, and was his great assistant in the government of his diocese.</P>
<P>Whilst these matters were transacting in this province, the king was taking the most effectual measures to secure the crown to his posterity. He first devised a means of taking off Edmund's children, who were yet in tender years, but much beloved of the people<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He gave them in charge to one of his domestics to carry them into Denmark, under colour of sending them abroad to travel; but in reality, it was only to have it in his power the more easily to dispatch them out of the way, when their absence should have lessened the affections of the people. The person entrusted with the princes, being conscious of the king's designs, was touched with compassion for these innocents, and instead of carrying them to Denmark, conducted them to the king of Sweden, discovering at the same time his master's intentions. The king of Sweden gave the English princes a very civil reception; but how∣ever, not to quarrel with Canute, he sent them to the court of Soloman king of Hungary, his relation, who was willing to take care of their education.—Bromp. Knighton. M. Westm.</NOTE>. Ethelred's two sons, by his queen Emma, were in safe∣ty, under the protection of their uncle the duke of Normandy. To obviate their claim to the throne, he proposed to the duke to take Emma to be his queen, and give him in marriage Estrita his sister; which being accepted, the solemnities were performed with great magnificence. Alfred and Edward were much averse to this connection, as they had been educated with a detestation of their family's mortal enemy; and the wrath this marriage gave birth to, in the minds of the princes, was much encreased by the queen's acceding to a settlement of the succes∣sion on her issue by Canute, in their deprivation.</P>
<P>Matters of state being thus settled, the king began to rid himself of those nobles whose crimes and vices he abhorred, and whose treacherous principles he feared. He banished Eric earl of Northumberland: Turkil duke of East-Anglia, another object of his wrath, fled in fear of his severer sentence; and Edric duke of Mer∣cia he found means to get rid of, without the appearance of predetermination. Having reproached the king one day for not rewarding the important services he rendered him, in cutting off the life of the brave Edmund, his brother-in-law, in which, it is said, he even employed his own son to give him a mortal wound: The king answered in a rage, since he was so audacious as to boast of the horrid treason, of which he had only stood distantly suspected, he should receive his me∣rited
<PB N="90" REF="135"/>reward; and instantly commanded him to be beheaded, and his body thrown into the Thames: Which sentence was executed in the palace. Thus it is, that evil ministers, after they have served their monarch's basest wishes, are despi∣sed, dreaded, and at last cut off from the face of the earth.</P>
<P>Canute, having established excellent rules of civil polity, and taken every wise measure for the due and impartial administration of justice, at length saw himself possessed of the affections of his people, his government secure, and his realm in peace. In this happy season, he made expeditions to Denmark, and settled the government there; effected the conquest of Norway; and, having reaped abun∣dance of laurels, after his return to England, gave his mind to the advancement of religion. This induced him to make a journey to Rome, from whence he re∣turned to complete the religious establishment and pious works he had begun. The historians of that time, who were chiefly religious, transmit his actions to posterity with lavish praises: The more moderate affirm, that for some years be∣fore his death, he became humble, modest, just, and truly religious.</P>
<P>Our prelate was fortunate in entering upon his See in a reign when the invete∣rate enemies of the Christian faith were declining rapidly; and the Danes becom∣ing Christians, appeared patrons and protectors of the church they so often injured. As if the king took upon himself the atonement and expiation of all the perse∣cutions St Cuthbert's church had suffered from his countrymen, he visited the church at Durham; not in regal pomp, parade, and pageantry, but with the hu∣miliations of a penitent, and with every solemnity of piety and religion. This victorious monarch's approach to the holy shrine, was an affecting spectacle of religious duty, which the spectator must have beheld with pious veneration, and great emotion of mind, which magnificence could not excite, or splendor effect. He, with his whole retinue, from a place probably named from the incident, <HI>Trimdane,</HI> proceeded in this holy pilgrimage by Garmundsway<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Malms.—L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l. Col. v. i. p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE>, to the Saint's shrine, a distance in those days called five miles, divested of all ensigns of royalty, and even with naked feet. He made donations to the church of various lands; his mansion-house of Staindrope, alias Standrop, with its appendages, viz. Gna∣patun; Scottun (Shotton); Rabi; Wacarfeld (Wakerfield); Efenwuda, alias E∣fenwuda (Evenwood); Alclit, alias Alcliff (Aycliff); Luteringtun (Lutrington); Elledun (Eldon); Ingeltun (Ingleton); Ticcelea (Thickley); Middletun (Middle∣ston, or Middleton); also Brunton, which lies on the south of Tees. In the further progress of this work, occasion will be offered to remark the places called Garmundsway and Trimdane<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel.

<P>The king, having spent several years in acts of devotion, departed this life in the year 1035, or 1036, in the 19th year of his reign, leaving his several king∣do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in peace to his children. Sweyn, his eldest son, he appointed to reign over Denmark: Harold, his second son, England; and Hardicanute, his son by queen Emma, Norway; thereby totally counteracting the act of settlement made on his marriage, and disappointing the hopes of his queen. This disposition, however
<PB N="91" REF="136"/>disagreeable to the English, the Danes were determined to fulfil; and Harold ha∣ving, with much foresight, seized the royal treasure at Winchester, was en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>d thereby to pacify some of the most violent in the opposition, and secure his co∣ronation. Wessex alone refused for a time to acknowledge him their sovereign; but, Hardicanute not coming as they wished to possess the opportunity offered of receiving the crown of that province, the people were brought over by earl Godwin, who had great power amongst them, to accede to Harold's sove∣reignty.</P>
<P>Emma, much chagrined by this revolution, began to devise means of restoring her sons by Ethelred to the crown of England; and for that purpose sent to Al∣fred to come over from Normandy, that he might make himself personally known to the English nobles. But on his arrival, being betrayed by the king's party in∣to a snare, concerted by earl Godwin, who had insinuated himself into queen Emma's confidence, he was carried to Guildford Castle, where his eyes were put out; and afterwards, being shut up in a monastery, he died through disappoint∣ment and grief. Soon afterwards, Emma was ordered to depart the kingdom, and retired to Bruges in Flanders. Harold did not survive these transactions long, having done few acts in church or state that were memorable. Leaving no issue, Hardicanute obtained a much easier means of accession than at that instant he was devising, being then at Bruges concerting means to recover the kingdom of Wessex; to which projects the news of Harold's death put a hasty conclusion.</P>
<P>He set sail for England with forty ships, which escorted him from Norway. On his landing, he was received by both English and Danes with acclamations of joy. His coronation was no sooner over, than he committed an infamous act of indig∣nity on the corpse of his interred brother and predecessor, which he caused to be taken from the sepulchre, beheaded, and thrown naked into the Thames; Alfric archbishop of York, earl Godwin, Styr the chamberlain, and Edric the sewer, being employed in this execrable act of revenge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Malms. p. 76.—Sym. Dun. p. 180.—M. Westm.—Brompton—Rapin.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the last year of Harold's reign, or about the time of Hardicanute's accession, in the 20th year of Eadmund's pontificate, about the year 1040, Duncan king of Scotland, with a vast army, made an irruption into Northumberland, and be∣set Durham, where many severe conflicts ensued; but at length, by a fortunate sally of the besieged, the Scots horse were put to the rout, the lines of the be∣siegers thrown into confusion, and the foot were cut to pieces. The heads of their leaders, collected together, were suspended on poles around the market-place.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that Symeon is the only author who mentions this assault, and assigns no cause for it. Besides, it is not said that Durham was made defen∣sible, by nature strong and lofty, or that it had any fortification<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 165.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There is great uncertainty and confusion in this period, touching the succession of the earls of Northumberland. Rapin speaks positively of the banishment of Eric, but gives no account who succeeded him. From other authorities, Eaduls,
<PB N="92" REF="137"/>surnamed Cudel, is mentioned as Eric's successor, brother to Uchtred. He is re∣presented as a man of pusillanimous nature, and sluggish disposition. The sur∣render of the Lothians to the Scots is attributed to him, he thereby purchasing their alliance and peace. There is much uncertainty, from the contradictory ac∣counts given of that matter, when the Lothians were first surrendered and detach∣ed from Northumberland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii.</NOTE>. Uchtred, it is said, was slain by Turebrand. Al∣dred, Uchtred's son, was Cudel's successor, who revenged the death of his father by slaying Turebrand, and afterwards fell a sacrifice to the vengeance of Curl, Tu∣rebrand's son. Aldred was succeeded by his brother Eadulf. He had some dis∣putes with the Welch, on whom he made depredations, which gave great displeasure to Hardicanute; to whose presence being commanded, in order to make retribu∣tion, and sue for terms of reconciliation, was slain by Siward, who succeeded to the earldom. Such were the prevailing customs and horrid manners of those days; times of imminent peril, when even the viceroys of such powerful provinces were cut off, in dreadful succession, by the hands of assassins, under the auspices of kings.</P>
<P>Eadmund governed his church with great dignity and honour. He was a man of excellent principles and rectitude of mind. During his episcopacy the possessions of the church were greatly augmented, and its rights well maintained. He exer∣cised jurisdiction over the church at Hexham, though his right was questioned by the archbishop of York, who, under his archiepiscopal authority, claimed to have the guardianship of that vacated bishopric<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 378.</NOTE>. He finished the western tower of the new church at Durham, begun by Aldune, and consecrated it<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Anglia Sacra.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>During this episcopacy, there was a priest belonging the church, called Aelfrid, a man of severe virtue, and religious austerity. With this character he is also said to have lived in great sobriety; was a liberal bestower of alms, and studious of the powers of eloquence and persuasion. He was the terror of the lascivious and immodest, and held in high veneration by the pious and just; was zealously devo∣ted to the service of St Cuthbert, and a rigid maintainer of the rights of the church. This man, by a vision, was commanded to collect, from the ancient monasteries and churches in Northumberland, the remains of holy personages buried there. He obtained the bones of Baltherus and Balfridus, anchorites; of Accae and Alch∣mund, bishops of Hexham; and king Oswine; of the venerable abbesses, Ebba and Ethelgitha; all which he translated to Durham, and placed near the body of St Cuthbert. He also brought from Melros the bones of St Boisil, St Cuthbert's preceptor, which he deposited in a shrine near that of the Saint. He also trans∣lated to this church, from Girwy, the remains of St Bede; and did many other pious works<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Symeon Dunelm, p. 165, 166.—Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 330, 378, 379.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The bishop, in the 23d year of his episcopacy, having travelled to Gloucester, to attend the king, was seized with a mortal disease, and died there. His remains were brought to Durham to be interred.</P>
<P>If credit is to be given to Symeon's evidence, our prelate, after his election, was not consecrated until after he had been presented to the king for his confirma∣tion.
<PB N="93" REF="138"/>It is the first instance in the history of this church of that practice, and per∣haps was in consequence of some new establishment made by Canute.</P>
<P>At this period it may be necessary to observe upon a tenure of church-lands, which had gained acceptation in the province of Northumberland, and is attri∣buted to archbishop Oswald.</P>
<P>Though it is not said in what manner, or on what conditions, the lands of St Cuthbert were held by the people, yet, by the preceding circumstances, it is self-evident they were held by military service; and notwithstanding the immunities of the church, and the exemptions of ecclesiastics from tallages to the service of the state, yet, as a royal thane, the bishop was obliged to do military service for his lands. Every donation in lands to the church would otherwise have been so grievous an injury to the state, as not to have received toleration, had such dona∣tions been an actual lopping off a member from the kingdom; in the limits of which, the people, as drones, were to fit in sluggish ease, and give no aid in the field in times of peril. There were drones enough in the ecclesiastic habit who wielded not the sword. The case might alter in after times, and the military ser∣vice become merely provincial, for such some authors have alledged it was, and the troops of this province, as guards to St Cuthbert's lands, called in af∣ter ages ST CUTHBERT'S PATRIMONY (after the example of the patrimony of St Peter at Rome), were not liable to serve beyond their limits. Of this, more in its place.</P>
<P>Under what grant, or articles of service, the lands of St Cuthbert were held by the occupants at this aera, is not known: But from the metropolitical ex∣ample, it is probable they were under similar conditions and services.</P>
<P>Oswald granted several lands by his charter, stiled <HI>Indiculum libertatis de Oswalds-Laws-Hundred,</HI> specifying, by the letter of it, that it was made under the royal assent. The conditions of this tenure are as followeth:</P>
<P>That the tenants shall perform all the attendance and duties of those who serve on horseback.</P>
<P>That they shall be bound to all payments which belong to the privilege and customs of the church; that is <HI>siricsceot, toll</HI> and <HI>tace,</HI> and <HI>swinscade,</HI> and all other dues belonging to the church, unless the bishop shall think fit to release any part of the terms.</P>
<P>They are likewise obliged to swear to comply with the bishop's orders, with all submission and regard.</P>
<P>Whenever the bishop's occasion shall require, they are bound to offer their ser∣vice in person; to furnish him with horses, and ride themselves.</P>
<P>They are likewise obliged to keep the steeple of the parish church, where the estate lies, in repair; and assist in the building of castles and bridges.</P>
<P>They are also to impale the bishop's parks, and supply him with hunting furni∣ture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Various tenures of this kind appear, in the sequel, for the chace in Stanhope.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>That when the bishop shall require their attendance, either for his own service, or the king's, they shall be ready for the juncture, and obey the chief officer of
<PB N="94" REF="139"/>the bishopric, in consideration of the fee, and in proportion to the bulk of the land which every one holds.</P>
<P>After the expiration of three lives, the lands shall revert to the bishopric; at which term it shall be in the power of the bishop for the time being, either to en∣ter upon the premisses, or make the tenant a new grant: Provided always, that the customary services due to the church are reserved.</P>
<P>If any of the articles or conditions happen to be broken by the tenant, he shall be obliged to make satisfaction, according to the usages of the bishop's court, or else forfeit the land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Reliquiae Spelman, p. 41, 42.—Angl. Sacra.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It was the declared opinion of the learned Sir Henry Spelman, that this was the usual mode of granting church-lands in those times; and that they were not conveyed for any longer term than life; or three lives; for so he asserts he found them in the abbey books. Those who had such grants, were the <HI>thani episcopi,</HI> and <HI>thani ecclesiae,</HI> mentioned in Doomsday-book; and the lands in that ancient record are usually denominated <HI>thane lands, ecclesiae episcopi, &amp; abbatis.</HI></P>
<P>EADRED came to the See in 1041, by the most infamous practices. He was a secular priest, and in no wise calculated to fill this See, now become opulent and powerful. He seized the treasures of the church, and, by an immoderate gift, purchased a no∣mination from the reigning prince, who had as little virtue or religion as himself. But his iniquity had a short reign; for he was smitten with a lingering and painful disease, in which he became bedridden for ten months; and, without enjoying the least fruits of his sinful purchase, departed this life, detested and despised<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 379.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Symeon, who relates this matter, leaves it totally in the dark in what manner this purchase was effected, and whether the king used any compulsory measures to obtain his election from the body of ecclesiastics, or he usurped a power of no∣mination, without their concurrence. If he came before the king with the chap∣ter's election, the necessity of a bribe doth not appear. But it is most probable he was only recommended by the king, and never was made bishop, as nothing is said of his consecration.</P>
<P>During the detestable reign of Hardicanute, which continued only three years, Siward earl of Northumberland was in the commission for executing the king's vengeance upon Worcester, which was sacked and reduced to ashes, for refusing to contribute to an enormous sum he demanded for payment of his navy. The king is supposed to have died gorged with an over-meal, his whole time being de∣bauched with gluttony and ebriety. Huntingdon was a lover of that royal muni∣ficence which was displayed at Hardicanute's court, where an open table for four meals a-day was constantly prepared; the abolition of which usage by his succes∣sors occasioned severe sarcasms from that author<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 166.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="95" REF="140"/>
<P>In the year 1042, upon the accession of Edward the Third, called <HI>the Confessor,</HI> EGELRIC, a monk, brought hither from Peterborough by Eadmund when returning from his consecration at Winchester, was made bishop of this See. It appears, that some undue influence of the crown was used in this case; for it is said<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ingulph—Wharton.</NOTE>, that he ob∣tained the See by the power of earl Godwin: And Symeon writes, that, in the third year of his episcopacy, the ecclesiastics of this church protesting against him, as being a member of another religious body, and extraneous there, and that he had been appointed their bishop contrary to their will, they expelled him the church. On this exigency, he had recourse to earl Siward, who at that time pos∣sessed very great power and authority, having the government of all the country from Humber to Tweed. By a passionate representation of his injuries, and a warm application of rich presents, he procured his intercession and influence with the adverse body; who, terrified at his power and principles, willing or not, were reconciled to their bishop, and restored him to his pontifical function and honours. The innovations which appear to have attacked the church rights in this aera, are to be lamented<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 166.</NOTE>. It is indeed to be admitted, that the method of chusing a bishop by the chapter, though less foreign than the excesses of the regale, was a deviation from the primitive practice; for by the ancient canons, a bishop ought to be chosen by the metropolitan and his suffragans; and, to prevent the incon∣veniencies which would be derived from the interposition of the state, the apostolic canons forbid the clergy making application to the sovereign for a bishopric, under the penalties of being deposed and excommunicated. Wharton says, Egelric was elected to the archbishopric of York; but, being unjustly deprived, the See of Durham was shortly after given him. From the authority of Florentius and Sy∣meon it appears, that Alfric, the archbishop, having committed many acts of op∣pression, and being charged with sundry misdemeanors, having busied himself too much in secular matters, was deprived by Hardicanute, and Egelric was appointed to the See; but, upon Edward's accession, making his peace with the crown, he was restored, and Egelric translated to Durham<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ang. Sac. p. 702.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On reassuming the pontificacy, Egelric set about some religious works; parti∣cularly the old church of Chester, where the remains of St. Cuthbert had rested above a century, was an erection of wood, and stood a monument of the deplo∣rable state of the arts in that age in which it was built. In honour to the patron Saint, he pulled it down, and built a church of stone there<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i. p. 331.</NOTE>. The bishop is charged with having fallen into a state of indolence. He had for his associates his brother Egelwin, and some other monks, to whom he resigned the chief manage∣ment of the affairs of this See: And Symeon, with all the warmth of prejudice, says, that they, with the bishop, were studious to diminish the wealth and orna∣ments of the church, and to purloin its riches, whenever occasion offered<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 167 159.</NOTE>. It
<PB N="96" REF="141"/>is not probable that the bishop, coming to this See in the manner he did, and a second time forced upon the ecclesiastics after they had gone to such extremities as to expel him, would live in cordiality with the religious body: The animosity of each party would break out at intervals to embitter their disputes and dissen∣tions; and, consequently, a desire of encreasing the honours and riches of the See, would be very languid in this prelate. Symeon adds, that when the work-people were laying a deep foundation for the new church at Chester, a very great treasure was discovered, hidden as it was presumed, by the officers of the avari∣cious bishop Sexhelm, who, being obliged to abscond, left it there<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 168.</NOTE>. But it is more probable it was a more ancient concealment, when Chester was a place of strength; and this appears to have been the case; for the bishop, looking upon the treasure as no part of the possessions of the church, but as a treasure-trove within his demesne, sent it to his monastery of Peterborough, then conceiving an intention of retiring thither himself<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">One of the laws of Edward, made for the benefit and protection of the church, or, as Sir H. Spelman denotes them, "Provisions extracted from the laws of his predecessors," No. 13. is to this effect: <Q>All “treasure-trove belongs to the king, unless it is found in a church or church-yard: In that case the gold ”is all the kings; the silver is to be divided in moieties; to the crown one, to the church the other.</Q> In this case Egelric stood in the place of the crown.</NOTE>. Had it consisted of sacred things, or of money of the currency of Sexhelm's time, there would have been some better ac∣count of it.</P>
<P>Shortly after this event, Egelric withdrew himself from the See, disgusted at the conduct of the ecclesiastic body of his church; and, weary of an enmity which was incompatible with religion, he left the bishopric under the government of his brother Egelwin. The riches he removed to Peterborough he employed in works not only magnificent, but also of public utility; as bridges, causeways, and other accommodations for the subject at large; and also therewith erected several church∣es. From the uninterrupted friendship which subsisted between Egelric and the excellent prelate Eadmund, to the close of his life, the candid mind is induced to consider our bishop in a more favourable light than Symeon would place him. From this familiarity, it is just to determine he was a man of many virtues, and of extensive judgment. With these set in contrast to the prejudices the monastic writer would instil, it is but candid to spare his character from contumely, and give his memory to posterity, with the good works he executed, without the par∣tial and local stigmas he stands blotted with in the church-history. He came to the See when the prerogative of the crown was extended beyond the ancient li∣mits which protected the privileges of the subject; and, conceiving he did no in∣jury to his church in employing the accidental riches he recovered in public works out of the territories of St Cuthbert, his life seems not to merit the con∣demnation it is branded with. Amidst the vexatious wranglings of his dissident clergy, it is no surprise he committed the government of the See to others, with∣out any motives from indolence and supineness. His abdication was not an act worthy of great censure, considering he was only retiring from confusion, and all those distractions which arose in an enmity and opposition, such as had gained
<PB N="97" REF="142"/>ascendency in that religious society. But it seems that the wrath of his foes pur∣sued him to the grave: For, being accused to William the Norman of having robbed the church of its treasures, he was commanded to appear before the king in London, was committed to safe custody till his case should be heard, and died in prison<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sym.

<P>Historians have disputed the propriety of Edward's accession in preference of Edmund's son, and Sweyn the son of Canute; but a disquisition of that nature is foreign to the present narrative. The matter was effected by the interposition of earl Godwin, whose interest was not obtained with any great difficulty, though Edward had so recently been his persecutor. The state came to a determination, that no one of Danish race should again wield the English sceptre; and it may be presumed an edict was published for abolishing the name and distinction of Dane in England from thenceforth; for that people are not from that period mention∣ed in history, as if the whole race had been extinct, though in the immediate pre∣ceding year they were masters of the kingdom. This strange circumstance gave occasion to the obscure and ill-supported relations of a massacre immediately suc∣ceeding Edward's coming to the crown. This prince was not distinguished for his genius, or the powers of his understanding; but, for his animosity and insatiable resentment towards his mother, he was infamous; depriving her, in an advanced age, of all the comforts of life; and she, who had been queen to two great po∣tentates, and the mother of two, was reduced, by his severity, to languish out the weary remnant of life in extreme poverty. Such was the man whose name is distinguished with the holy characters of <HI>Saint</HI> and <HI>Confessor.</HI></P>
<P>The disputes which were agitated between the king and earl Godwin, are in no ways pertinent to the present subject. On the earl's death, his son Harold, of su∣perior parts and abilities, succeeded to his honours. About this period, a con∣test arising between Macbeth and Malcolm, two princes of Scotland, for the pro∣vince of Cumberland, the king commanded Siward, with the forces of Northum∣berland, to restore Malcolm to the quiet possession of that territory, which he ef∣fected in one decisive battle. Some historians speak of this matter, as if Mal∣colm then obtained the crown of Scotland; but this position is not supported by their chronology. Fordun places Malcolm's accession to the crown in 1057, two years after Siward's death, which appears the most probable. The joy of this victory was damped by the loss of the earl's gallant son, who was among the slain<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun.</NOTE>. When the melancholy news was brought to his father, he did not give way to any parental feelings till he satisfied his honour that the youth died with∣out disgrace. He interrogated the messengers impatiently, <Q>Where were his “”wounds?</Q> To which they replied, "They were on his breast." With an ex∣tacy of heroic virtue he exclaimed, <Q>I thank God the boy hath done his duty, “”and I am reconciled:</Q> To which his tenderer tears succeeded<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Huntingd.</NOTE>. The earl did not survive this victory long: He was seized with the bloody-flux, which soon pro∣ved mortal; and his remains were interred in the cloister of the monastery of St
<PB N="98" REF="143"/>Mary, without the walls of York, which he founded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brompt.</NOTE>. On the approach of death, whilst he languished deeply under his disease, regarding an exit in bed as disgraceful to a man of his heroic spirit, he commanded his armour to be brought, in which he was accoutred, that, agreeable to a wish he had repeatedly expressed whilst in health, <HI>he might expire, as he had lived, in arms.</HI> Brompton describes him as a man of most gigantic stature, and of an intrepidity suitable to his form. As his grandmother, the daughter of a Danish earl, was walking in a wood, ac∣companied by her women, near her father's house, a bear rushed from the forest, and bore her off from her affrighted attendants. By this monster she was ra∣vished, and had a son named Bernus, who was born with bear's ears. He, in right of his mother, succeeded to the earldom, and, proving a valiant soldier, espoused a lady of equal rank, on whom he begot the brave earl Siward, who came and settled in England<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 945.</NOTE>. Thus, in allegory, is wrapped up the rape of this lady, by some powerful person of the country.</P>
<P>On the death of Siward, Tosti, one of the sons of earl Godwin, was made earl of Northumberland; and, by his influence<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 379.</NOTE>, EGELWIN was confirmed in the bishopric of Durham, abdicated by his brother. He was also a monk of the monastery of Peterborough. Symeon places this event in the 15th year of Edward's reign, A. D. 1056: And this bishop's appointment seems to be an arbitrary act of the earl, by whose support and favour Symeon says he was advanced. During his brother's episcopacy, he managed, as suffragan, all the secular affairs of the See, and thereby, it is presumed, amassed a considerable treasure<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ridpath, in his Border History, says, that Malcolm of Scotland made a wasting inroad into the pro∣vince of Northumberland, in Tosti's absence, and violated the peace of St Cuthbert in Holy Island. And, in a note from Sim. ad Ann. adds, that Tosti, together with Kinsi archbishop of York, and Egelwin bishop of Durham, had conducted Malcolm to the presence of Edward, two years before.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Tosti, of a tyrannical and morose temper, conducted himself with such rigour and oppressive principles towards the Northumbrians, that their affections were soon weaned from him: But, by the death of Gospatric, a person of great power in that province, and afterwards of two of his sons, slain by the earl's influence or procurement, and by the imposition of a grievous tax upon the inhabitants, he became detestable, and, with one accord, they rose in arms to expel him the province, and demand his being deposed of the crown. Harold, by the com∣mand of the king, at the head of a powerful army, met the insurgents on the frontiers to compel their submission; but hearing the people's complaints, he transmitted a remonstrance to the king, so powerfully loaded with proofs of into∣lerable acts of tyranny and oppression, that their pardon was not only granted, but Morcar, son of the duke of Mercia, was appointed to the earldom; upon which Tosti fled from the king's wrath into Flanders.</P>
<PB N="99" REF="144"/>
<P>Soon after these transactions, the king was seized with a mortal disease; and Harold ascended the throne by the unanimous election of the people, in preference of Edgar Etheling, son of prince Edward, and grandson of Edmund, who was then in England.</P>
<P>We have several instances in our history, that, under the weakest and wicked∣est princes, our most salutary laws have issued, and the noblest principles of our constitution have been established. In them it was an involuntary act; they were made the mere instruments of Providence, under the influence of wise coun∣sellors, to promulgate what they neither meant or understood, but which, in the will of Heaven, were pregnant with blessings for generations unnumbered. One of those incidents is in this reign, and perhaps took place when the states deter∣mined to extinguish the Danish name. The various laws which had gained accep∣tation in the three great districts of the kingdom, in Wessex, the Saxon; in Mercia, the Mercian; and in Northumberland, the Danish; were reduced into one code, by which the whole country should be governed. Various parts of those provincial laws could not be totally eradicated, having become riveted with the tenures of lands, and otherwise so established, that their usage was obliged still to be tolerated; and they were accordingly made consistent to, and confirmed in, their peculiar districts. It must suffice in this place to say, that in this matter is seen the establishment of our common law, the most excellent principles of which are derived from the Saxons; for as to the Danes, they left little that was elevated above brutality.</P>
<P>Earl Tosti, during the time he held the earldom of Northumberland, professed a great veneration for the church of St Cuthbert, which he, and Judith his wife, ornamented with many rich gifts, particularly a large crucifix of plated work in gold and silver, and decorated with jewels of high price: Also images of the Vir∣gin Mary, and John the Evangelist<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 379. v. iv. p. 114.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Harold did not wear the crown long in peace: He was first disturbed by his brother Tosti, who made several descents upon the coasts, and carried off much plunder. After repeated depredations in that manner, and retreats, he at length returned with a formidable armament, having engaged the king of Norway in the enterprize, under a delusive promise of conquering the kingdom. They at first entered the river Tyne with a large fleet, and pillaged the country on each side of the river; after which they sailed for the Humber, and there disembarked. An engagement soon after ensued with the Northumbrian troops under earl Mor∣car, and the western forces, under Edwin earl of Chester, in which the invaders were victorious. Flushed with this success, they marched forward to meet the royal army, which was advancing. A battle was sought at a place called Stan∣ford-bridge, near York, and the invaders suffered a total defeat, the king of Nor∣way and Tosti being among the slain. Such was the horrid carnage of the day, that of the whole army that came from Norway in five hundred ships, the re∣mains returned in twenty, granted them by the victor. The booty which fell in∣to
<PB N="100" REF="145"/>the hands of the king's army after this victory, was very considerable, there being found in the enemy's camp all the money and effects they brought with them, together with the riches they had heaped up from the pillage of the coun∣try.</P>
<P>No sooner was the king at rest from the toils of war, occasioned by the late invasion, than he received intelligence that the duke of Normandy had landed with a large army in Sussex. He advanced with all possible diligence to oppose this formidable enemy, whose design he was fully informed of; and the fatal battle of Hastings soon after determined William's claim to the crown of England, by the death of the king, who received an arrow in his temple which pierced his brain, the total rout of the English army ensuing. What imputation fell on the character of the deceased sovereign, in ascending the throne, or which was the greater crime, breaking the oath he made to William duke of Normandy, or gra∣tifying his ambition by the exclusion of Edgar from the crown of his ancestors, belongs not to the historian to enquire. It is confessed by all, that Harold posses∣sed exalted virtues, and was endowed with all those excellencies necessary to form a great prince. He had a distinguished integrity of heart, was affable, and of engaging manners; and his generosity and munificence were truly princely. The impetuosity of his mind, and his too nice sense of honour, perhaps were his greatest failings, and principally tended to his fall.</P>
<P>Morcar earl of Northumberland, with the northern troops, retired to London; where, in every assembly in which the right of succession was agitated, he strenu∣ously supported the cause of Edgar. When the duke moved his army towards the city, the confusion of the people, and divided opinions of the nobles, sufficiently proved to the earl, that all opposition to the Normans would prove ineffectual; therefore he withdrew his forces, and retired to the north. Soon afterwards, the keys of the city gates were surrendered; the small number of bishops and lay∣lords then in London, in a pusillanimous manner, made a tender of the sceptre; and, on Christmas-day following, in the year 1066, he was crowned king of Eng∣land. Earl Morcar submitting to the stream, voluntarily attended, and swore his fealty; on which his office and estates were continued to him.</P>
<P>The king having established a mode of government, and placed garrisons of Norman troops in all the fortresses, he proposed a visit to Normandy. To secure the state from conspiracy and insurrection in his absence, he took with him seve∣ral of the most powerful of the nobility, among whom earl Morcar was one, who thought themselves no better than hostages in his train, and were disturbed as being exhibited as ornaments to his triumph. Whilst the king was absent, the intolerable oppressions of the regents occasioned a general discontent, and two for∣midable insurrections succeeded, which hastened his return. From thenceforth mutual jealousies between the sovereign and his people were daily fomented, which grew up to a terrible degree of vehemence on the odious tax of Danegelt being revived, and levied on the lands with the utmost rigour. This was followed by a tyrannical confiscation of the estates of those who appeared in arms for their so∣vereign Harold, which was one of the most remarkable events of this reign;
<PB N="101" REF="146"/>for the confiscated lands were given to the Normans, who thereby became more considerable in England than the English themselves: But from thence were de∣rived great power and advantage to the king; for he not only filled his coffers with riches, but also, by such distribution of his chiefs in all quarters of the land, who were firmly devoted to his service, he gained a powerful interest to support him on the throne.</P>
<P>Whilst the lamentations and rage of the people were every where heard, and execrations incessantly poured forth from innumerable lips against the tyrant, afflicted with the miseries which surrounded them, Edwin earl of Chester, and Morcar earl of Northumberland, took up arms, and carried their forces into the field, presuming from the general distress an insurrection would take place in every part of the kingdom. This wore a serious countenance, and obliged the king, with all possible haste, to collect his troops, and move towards the north, to suppress the rebellion in its infancy. The expedition the king used, and his formidable army of veteran soldiers, intimidated the people in other parts of the land from taking up arms. The northern earls finding themselves disappointed in the event, and not able singly and unsupported to try the conflict, were obli∣ged to submit and sue for mercy. The king approaching York, the citizens brought the keys of their gates, and laid them at his feet. But, though this act of submission procured them an exemption from corporal punishment, yet their pardon did not extend so far as to secure them from a heavy fine, which he impo∣sed on the city; and they with grief beheld the walls of a fortress rise in the heart of their city, which should for ever after overawe them, garrisoned with Norman soldiers. The earls of Chester and Northumberland, with Archil, a powerful Northumbrian lord, and Egelwin bishop of Durham, were received to the king's clemency, and swearing their fealty, were pardoned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a paper among the Burghleian MSS. touching the title of Lord Willughby of Eresby, shew∣ing how this barony, before the conquest, belonged to the See of Durham; and that at the conquest, by the Conqueror, with the bishop's consent, it was given to Pinzon, who thereby became lord of Eresby: And his tenure was, to serve the said bishop at Duresme at the day of his consecration, in the office of steward; which service, by special words in the grant, might not be done by any other deputy than his eld∣est son, being a knight, or by some other knight: Therefore it argued in himself a higher degree, as to be a baron: And the same stile to be incident to the head manor of the barony, by name Eresby; which ever had and hath divers manors, as members belonging to the same.

The earl of Nor∣thumberland, with many others, conceiving their punishment was only deferred to a more secure time for the king to shew his resentment, retired into Scotland, where prince Edgar had sought refuge. In a little time the king displayed a new exertion of tyrannical power, in depriving the people of the custody of arms, seizing the same into his hands, and laying them up in arsenals, formed in the se∣veral castles he was building, or had erected throughout the land: And then, under severe penalties, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he prohibited the use of fire or candles when the

<P>The Northumbrians, who had constantly exercised extended powers of liberty, and enjoyed its fullest benefits, were the most impatient under their grievances. The ancient spirit they have through this narrative been constantly marked by, still reigned amongst them. They could not brook the least injury without ma∣king a remonstrance, and that was frequently attended with an insurrection. The turbulent and ferocious temper this people displayed, and their vicinity to Scot∣land, whose monarch was deeply interested in Edgar's welfare, by his marriage with that prince's sister, determined the king to send a Norman lord to take on him the government of that earldom<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel.

<PB N="103" REF="148"/>His rough and austere temper, the king conceived, would suit well to counteract the licentious dispositions of those he was to govern. When the Nor∣thumbrians were informed of his approach, they at first gave themselves up to de∣spair, regarding him as a monster sent to afflict them with every severity of tyran∣nical government: Several fled their habitations, and sought shelter in the forests▪ and others took shipping for foreign countries.</P>
<P>Some of the fugitive Northumbrians who arrived in Denmark, prostrated themselves before Sweyn, the king, and, in the most passionate phrase, repre∣sented to him their miserable state, and the distraction of their country; they implored his aid in the most affecting language, and called for his pity as descend∣ants of the Danish race. They assured him, not only the Northumbrians would join his arms, but also the western provinces, and a large body of troops from Scotland; they described the injuries and deposition of Edgar, their lawful sove∣reign, and moved him to compassion. Rapin says, they persuaded Sweyn the conquest of England was practicable; and from that view chiefly he engaged in the enterprize: But the authorities tend more clearly to prove, that the attempt was calculated to expel the Normans in favour of Edgar. Whilst a fleet was fit∣ting out with a large armament from Denmark, earl Cumin arrived at Durham. The commotion which appeared among the people at the earl's approach, alarm∣ed the bishop, and gave him suspicions that an insurrection was designed. The respectable author just mentioned conceives it was a previous design, that the fugitives to Denmark should sue for succour from thence, the event of which the people then impatiently expected; and, "as Cumin's arrival might prove very prejudicial to the plan they had formed, the principal contrivers of the scheme resolved to rid themselves of so troublesome an inspector, with his attendants." Whether this part of the history is maintainable or not, it is evident the bishop entertained fears for the earl's safety, and when he met him at the limits of his bishopric, he informed him of the apprehensions he had of his danger; for he had heard it whispered by the populace, that they would never submit to be go∣verned by a stranger<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 181, 182.</NOTE>. The earl, with all the insolence of a proud heart, treated the bishop's cautions with contempt; and, so far from shewing any acts of mode∣ration and clemency on his first approach, in order to remove the prejudices of the people, he punished several who were landholders under the church, and had affronted him in his march, with severity, and some he put to death. He was mistaken in conceiving such measures would strike a terror on the country: Un∣cultivated men, of a robust constitution, and ferocious habits, are seldom moved with fear; but, cherishing hatred of injuries, burn for revenge. The death of the peasants was a summons to unsheath the sword; and, though this was the se∣vere season of February, multitudes of men, from all quarters, assembled soon af∣ter the decline of day, and girt the city round with troops. The earl's guards had taken forcible possession of the houses as their wantonness incited, and, being dispersed through the place, in contempt of danger, gave themselves up to cas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="104" REF="149"/>and self-enjoyment. Just at the dawn of day, the assailants broke open all the gates of the town, and flying in parties through every street, made a dreadful slaughter of the Normans; insomuch that, Symeon says, the streets were filled with blood and carcasses. Many were shut up in the house where the earl lodged, and, defending it bravely, the enraged populace could not force an entrance; therefore, throwing in firebrands, they set the edifice in flames. When those within saw the imminent peril to which they were reduced, they forced open the doors, and attempted to escape the fury of the fire, but were slain as they came out. At length the building was reduced to ashes, with every thing within its walls. The fire of this mansion was so vehement, that the flames were observed to take hold of the western tower of the church. The afflicting spectacle alarm∣ed the multitude: The religious, and inhabitants of the city, and even those in arms, ceasing from slaughter, fell upon their knees, with eyes filled with tears, and elevated hands, petitioning Heaven, that, by the aid of their holy Saint, and through his interposition, the sacred edifice might be spared from destruction. Quickly the wind shifted to the east, and bore the flames from the church. Thus the earl, on the 2d of the kal. of February, A. D. 1069, with his 700 guards, (one man excepted, who escaped with his wounds), were put to death.</P>
<P>It must be remarked in this place, that the authors who give the foregoing ac∣count, point out, that Durham, at that period, was defended by gates, and con∣sequently by walls, palisades, or some other fortification used in that age. It is most probable the mansion which was burnt was the bishop's palace, and not solely appropriated for the earl's residence; and it distinguishes, that the church did not stand on the ground which the present cathedral covers, as that mansion was to the west of it.</P>
<P>Soon after the slaughter of the Normans at Durham, the Danish armament ap∣peared on the coast, under the command of Osbern, the king's brother; a large body of Scottish forces were immediately put in motion, attended by Edgar, and all the fugitive lords who had sought asylum at Malcolm's court; the Northumbrians in general were in arms; and the whole uniting, gave some anxiety to the king. They marched immediately to York, where the Normans had a garrison, some au∣thors say, consisting of 4000 men. In order to prevent the suburbs being a shelter to the combined army, the troops in the castle set them on fire; and, in the confla∣gration, the greatest part of the city, the monastery and cathedral, were reduced to ashes. The friends of literature, on this occasion, came to a dreadful loss, by the destruction of a valuable library, the collection of which was begun so early as the latter end of the eighth century. The assailants stormed the citadel, and put the whole garrison to the sword. After this blow, Earl Waltheof was placed in the castle with English troops, and the army retired a little from York, to an advan∣tageous post, where they lay fortified, waiting the king's approach. After conci∣liating the minds of some malcontents in the southern parts of England, by acts of clemency, justice and relaxation, the king moved his army by slow marches to∣wards the enemy. He was so provoked with the Northumbrians, that he was heard
<PB N="105" REF="150"/>to swear by his usual oath, <HI>by God's splendor,</HI> he would not leave a soul alive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hoved.—Rapin.</NOTE>. As soon as he entered Yorkshire he began to put his horrid threats into execution, by permitting his troops to commit every excess, to ravage, plunder, and destroy, as the wantonness of avarice, lust, cruelty, and revenge might dictate. The com∣bined army lay in their fortifications, determined to receive the foe in that situa∣tion; but the king saw too much peril in an attempt to engage them so advanta∣geously placed. The leaders lay for some time inactive, whilst detached parties of Normans were let loose to desolate the adjacent country, and, with the scourge of destruction, to punish the miserable and innocent for the defections of those with whom they had no criminal part. But such are generally the indiscriminate ravages of war. Whilst the king revolved in his mind the hazard in which an unfortunate battle might involve his crown, he determined to try the power of money, and to corrupt Osbern with a bribe. The effect equalled his most san∣guine wish; for the Dane took the gold, drew off his troops, and set sail for Den∣mark, leaving the confederates in a deplorable state of suspence and disappoint∣ment. At length most of the forces left in the intrenchments marched off in de∣files, and returned home, leaving Waltheof, and his garrison, to sustain the king's wrath in a siege. The earl was supposed to be one of the most skilful and bravest generals of the age; and, by his prudent conduct, supported the defence with such bravery, that the king, after innumerable assaults, and a tedious blockade, had gained no advantages, and began to despair of success, when the want of provisions obliged the gallant governor to submit himself to the sovereign's mercy. There are charms in bravery which win the hearts of the brave, even from the horrid possession of pride, jealousy, and revenge. The king, charmed with Wal∣theof's military excellence, granted the garrison the most honourable terms, and not only pardoned the earl<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Malms.</NOTE>, but received him to his bosom; won him to be his friend by his royal munificence, and loaded him with marks of esteem. He gave him in marriage his niece, daughter to the countess of Albemarle; and, to sup∣port the dignity of the alliance, made him earl of Northampton and Huntington. The king received the submission of earl Gospatric, who, with a large sum, pur∣chased the earldom of Northumberland; a dignity which he aspired to, as being descended from a former race of earls, his mother Algitha being daughter of earl Uchtred, by his wife Elfgiva, daughter of king Ethelred. Algitha's husband, and the father of Gospatric, was Maldred, the son of Crinan, who was progeni∣tor of the noble family of Nevills, of whom, in the sequel, there will be occasion to speak<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Dugdale's Baro. v. i. p. 287.</NOTE>. It is related by Symeon, that Morcar, after his advancement to the earldom of Northumberland, being occupied in other great affairs, gave the go∣vernment of the country beyond the Tyne to Osulph, a youth, son of Eadulf, who was earl Uchtred's brother and successor. According to the same author, the king, having deprived Osulph of his government, conferred it on Copsi, uncle to earl Tosti, a man of wisdom and experience in the affairs of government, and who had formerly the charge of the province, whilst Tosti was earl. Osulph
<PB N="106" REF="151"/>being expelled by Copsi, and obliged to take shelter in the woods and mountains, collected around him a bandit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i in the like desperate circumstances. With these desperadoes he beset a house where Copsi was at a feast; and, pursuing him to a church, whither he fled for sanctuary, they set it on fire, and he was slain by Osulph in the gate. This happened on the 11th of March, in the fifth week af∣ter Copsi was made earl. In the following autumn Osulph received a mortal wound by the spear of a robber, whom he imprudently attacked. After the death of Osulph, according to be annalist who relates the circumstances just men∣tioned, and, most probably al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, after the death of Cumin, the king sold the earldom to Gospatric. Dugdale adopts this order of the succession of earls<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dugdale's Baro. v. i. p. 54.</NOTE>. Symeon in his account, in which he is copied by Hoveden and others, says, that, on Osulph's death, Gospatric purchased the earldom; yet inconsistently asserts that Copsi, who was slain by Osulph, was not promoted to his earldom until Mor∣car was a prisoner, A. D. 1071.</P>
<P>Copsi was a patron of the church of St Cuthbert; and, whilst deputy to Tosti, he gave to the Saint, and those who served at his shrine, for ever, his church at Marsk, dedicated to St Germain by bishop Egelric; together with the vill of Marsk, and the lands thereto adjoining; ten carucates and a half of land in Marsk, two carucates in Thornton, ten oxgangs in Tuccotes, in Redcar half a carucate, in Guisburn one carucate; and, as a perpetual testimony of such his grant, he gave therewith a large silver bowl or cup, to be preserved in the church as a last∣ing memorial.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 376.—Symeon, p. 178.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To return to the king's progress. Symeon says, the king detached a party from York, with orders to revenge Cumin's death; but, having proceeded as far as Alverton, such a thick fog surrounded them, that they could scarce see each other, and could not possibly discover their way. This strange event, together with an alarm their superstition received, by relations of the power and miraculous protection the Saint whom they were about to persecute had shewed for his people, insomuch that few of his enemies ever escaped, they retreated in fear of the con∣demnation threatened them. But the king was not to be intimidated in that manner. He marched northward, and ravaged and destroyed the country in so merciless a manner, that, <Q>for sixty miles between York and Durham, he did “not leave a house standing; reducing the whole district, by fire and sword, to ”a horrible desart, smoking with blood, and in ashes.</Q> He did not even spare the churches or monasteries; a fact which Malmsbury, a Norman, does not pre∣sume to deny<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 380. v. iii.—Hoveden.</NOTE>. The reason alledged for this devastation was, to render the country incapable of maintaining future Danish adventurers. But the truth ap∣pears, it was done to glut his vengeance and wrathful spirit, and intimidate the more northern inhabitants from the like enterprizes. It is impossible, according to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elations given by historians who speak of this horrid scene, to describe the miseries of the people. A dreadful famine ensued, and a mortality not equal∣led
<PB N="107" REF="152"/>in the annals of this country: They were reduced to eat the flesh of horses, dogs, and cats, and at last even human carcasses<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Symeon.—Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 380.</NOTE>. The lands lay un<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illed for nine years, infested by robbers and beasts of prey; and the poor remnant of the inhabitants spared from the sword, died in the fields, overwhelmed with want and misery. When the ruthless tyrant approached the city of Durham, he found it evacuated, the ecclesiastics departed, and the church left without a minister to perform any sacred office<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hoved.</NOTE>. The king's army being dispersed in destructive par∣ties over all the country between Tyne and Were, saw the villages deserted, and the whole country become a dismal waste, the inhabitants having fled with their flocks and herds into the most secret parts of the forests and mountains. Not mo∣ved to compassion by a scene so wretched, the barbarians set fire to the monastery of Girva or Jarrow, and rejoiced over its ashes<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hoved.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the king's approaching near to Durham, the bishop called a council of the principal men in his city, and, it being with their unanimous approbation, he determined to fly from thence with the sacred remains of St Cuthbert, which, from the time of Aldune's settling there, had rested in Durham for 75 years<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 183, 184.</NOTE>. The holy fugitives took their way towards Lindisfarne: They rested the first night at the monastery of Jarrow, the second at Bedlington, the third at Tughil, and on the fourth day, in the evening, the bishop, with a vast concourse of people, arrived on the shore opposite to the holy island, when they found the sea at high water. The severity of the winter rendered the night air intolerable to the aged and infirm, as well as those of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ender years; and much lamentation was heard among the people; when, by a particular interposition, the sea retired, and left a dry passage for the wanderers, who, with loud thanksgiving and holy joy, passed over to the island. And what completed the miracle, was, as Symeon says, those who carried the Saint's remains gave evidence, that, as soon as the multitude had passed, the sea returned, and closed up the vacancy, which a few moments before had divided the waters.</P>
<P>Peace being restored, and the king having withdrawn his troops, the bishop, with his brethren and people, set forward on their return, with steps of melan∣choly, and many tears, beholding the fertile plains laid waste, the villages deso∣late, the whole country depopulated, and become a dreadful solitude. After an absence of four months, they entered the city on the 8th of the kal. of April, A. D. 1070, and replaced the sacred remains of St Cuthbert in his shrine<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Symeon, p. 185.—Lel. Col. v. iii.</NOTE>. The bishop, in his slight, removed or concealed all the ornaments of the church, ex∣cept the crucifix given by earl Tosti and his wife, which being too ponderous to be removed, was left, in hopes no enemy would approach it without veneration and reverence, and that they would have the like regard to the sacred edifice. But, on their return, they found the crucifix thrown down, and stripped of all the gold, silver, and gems, that formerly adorned it. It is intimated, that earl Gospatric advised the bishop's slight, taking possession of the incident to strip the church of every thing he could find that was valuable<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 376, 381.</NOTE>. One of the ecclesias∣tics,
<PB N="108" REF="153"/>Symeon says, was sent forth as a spy, to observe what passed around the city, after the bishop and his train left it; and that one night he had a horrid vi∣sion, in which he saw one Gillo Michael<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 331, 381.—Symeon, p. 186.</NOTE>, (who had done many injuries to the bishop and his people, as they were on their journey), in the torments of the damned: And also, in the same vision, he beheld St Cuthbert and St Oswald at the high altar, denouncing eternal woes on Gospatric for sacrilegiously taking away the holy things of the church, and converting them to his own use. This coming to Gospatric's ear, attended with the circumstance of Gillo's sudden death on the night of the vision, he was seized with a religious horror, and the torments of an afflicted conscience; and, to expiate his crime, immediately set out on a pilgri∣mage to Holy Island, with naked feet, during an inclement winter, seeking remis∣sion of the Saint, by prayers, tears, and rich gifts. This author says, Gospatric, after this impiety and sacrilege, never prospered, was expelled his earldom, and, in the latter end of his days, suffered great adversity and distress.</P>
<P>Soon after the king left the Northumbrian territories, Malcolm king of Scot∣land made an inroad by way of Cumberland<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. iii.—Symeon.</NOTE>, and, carrying dreadful devastation down the course of the river Tees, penetrated as far as Cleveland, and there burnt and destroyed every thing in his march<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hoved.</NOTE>. At Hunderthwaite, a place op∣posite to Egleston, the people of Teesdale made a stand, and were routed with great slaughter. Whilst Malcolm was thus employed, Gospatric made an inroad into Cumberland, and returning with many spoils, shut himself up in Bambrough Castle, from whence making frequent sallies, he annoyed and weakened the forces of Malcolm, who was returning by the eastern coasts. Enraged by these repeated sufferings, the Scottish king committed the most horrid cruelties upon the people<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ford. l. v. c. 18.</NOTE>, and carried such multitudes into captivity, that, for many years after, scarce a cottage in Scotland was destitute of English slaves. Malcolm, in this expedition, burnt Hartlepool, and the monastery of Weremouth; looking on with inhuman pleasure whilst the sacred piles consumed. In the haven at the mouth of the Were, it is said<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Symeon.</NOTE>, he found concealed on board of some small vessels, Edgar, with his mother and sisters, and several people of high rank, who were about to set sail for Scotland.</P>
<P>After so much on the affairs of the state at large, it is high time to advert to that momentous aera, in which there was a total subversion of the tenures of lands, a reformation of the service of the subject, and an introduction of those feodal principles under which the people groaned for many centuries. The king was con∣vinced by the late circumstance of calling in the Danes, that the restless temper of the English, impatient of injuries, and forward to revenge, would never sub∣mit to a total subversion of their laws and liberties, whilst any power or autho∣rity remained in their hands; in short, whilst they were not stripped of every thing valuable: And he formed his resolutions accordingly. He immediately dispossessed them of all the baronies and fiefs they held of the crown, and gave the same to
<PB N="109" REF="154"/>his own retainers, even with an astonishing degree of profusion. His brother Robert held of his gift, with the earldom of Cornwall, 846 manors; and several others had little inferior. Hugh Lupus of Almonches, the king's sister's son, had the county palatine of Chester, with all royal prerogatives, to hold it in as ample sovereignty as the king held his crown. It is needless to name more of those; and the latter is named only because, in the progress of this narrative, frequent occasion will be had to refer to it. Each grandee was to furnish horsemen with arms, at the king's command; and they, granting out their extensive districts in manors and smaller estates, reserved the services proportionably from those who held the lands. It was not only the lay-property that was thus handled, but also the church-lands were made liable to furnish horsemen and arms in the same pro∣portion, notwithstanding the immunities the Saxon princes had ordained, when the ancient charters were granted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A modern author speaking of the Franks, says, "The landed estates of the clergy grew so great, that in time the military power of the kingdom was much enfeebled; for though they were obliged to furnish men for the wars, according as the lands they held were liable to that service, this was performed with such backwardness and insufficiency, that the state at one time was near overturned, and it became neces∣sary to provide a remedy."—Sullivan's Lectures, lect. v. p. 54.
<P>The similarity between our Saxon laws and those mentioned above, need not be pointed out to the ju∣dicious reader.</P>
<P>We find the laws of William I. are in general little other than transcripts of the Saxon laws or customs: However there are two which were intended to alter the military policy of the kingdom, and to abolish the <HI>trinoda necessitas;</HI> and, in its lieu, to make the lands of the English, and of the church, liable to knights-service, as the Normans lands were by their new grants, and thereby make the system uniform. His 52d law is entirely in feudal terms, and was certainly drawn up by some person skilled in that law for the purpose. It runs thus: <Q>Statuimus, ut omnes liberi homines saedere &amp; sacramento affirment, quod “intra et extra universum regnum Angliae Willielmo domino suo fideles esse volunt, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erras &amp; honores il∣lius ”ubique servare cum co &amp; contra inimicos &amp; alienigenas desendere.</Q>—L L. Angl. Sax. ap. Wil∣kins, p. 228.—Wright on Tenures, p. 66.—Sullivan, 265.</P>
<P>William's 58th law is to this effect: <Q>We enact and firmly command, that all earls, barons, and knights, “and servants, (that is the lower soldiers not knighted, who had not yet got lands, but were quartered on the abbeys), and all the freemen, (namely the Saxon freeholders, and the tenants of the church, which now was subjected to knights-service) of our whole aforesaid kingdom, shall have and keep themselves well in arms, and in horses, as is sitting, and their duty; and that they should be always ready and well prepared to fulfil and to act whensoever occasion shall be; according to what they ought by law to do for us from their fiefs and tenements; and as we have enacted to them from the <HI>commune concilium</HI> of our ”whole kingdom aforesaid, and have given and granted to them in fee, and in hereditary right.</Q> In this law is pointed out the service required, and to ascertain the hereditary rights of all the tenants, Saxons as well as Normans.—LL. Angl. Sax. ap. Wilkins.—Wright on Tenures, p. 72.—Sullivan, 267.</P>
<P>From this time all lands in England were described, "to be held of the king." Ecclesiastical corpora∣tions, under the description of <HI>liberi homines,</HI> according to their wealth, were obliged to find <HI>one or more knights or horsemen;</HI> if as many as a baron, they were thereby barons, and intitled to sit in the <HI>commune concilium.</HI></P></NOTE>. This was not the only persecution the church suffered; for the king, pretending he had information that the treasures of the rebels were concealed in the religious houses, he ordered the northern churches to be ransacked, and even spared not the ornaments of the shrines, and the sacred vessels of the altars. He had not peace of mind with the clergy, whose greatness he wanted much to reduce. For this purpose he applied to Rome, praying that two legates might be sent into England, to enquire into the abuses of the church; by whose aid he dispossessed the archbishop of Canterbury, and some others of the first prelates in the kingdom. Those whom the king disliked, and could not be impeached by any legatory authority of his own, he imprisoned
<PB N="110" REF="155"/>them, and placed foreigners in the vacant Sees. He also carried a like exercise into the monasteries. These acts of oppression alarmed the whole state; and, as the effect of despair itself, the people rose in arms, heated by the exhortations and cries of the clergy, and headed by several abbots, and dignified ecclesiastics, de∣termined to shake off the bondage in which they were involved, or perish in the attempt. Edgar was called upon to take the conduct of the armaments, which shewed themselves in every quarter; and he was publicly proclaimed king where∣ever his party prevailed. By the advice of Lanfranc, the new archbishop of Can∣terbury, the king desired a conference with the malcontents, where, in an insi∣nuating phrase, and with all the flowers of flattery, of which, notwithstanding his temper, he was master, having all the accomplishments of hypocrisy, he en∣deavoured to remove the people's apprehensions, promising a redress of grievan∣ces, and swearing on the books of the Evangelists, to restore and establish the ancient laws of Edward the Confessor. His adversaries, thus deluded and appea∣sed, retired, and disbanded their troops. As soon as the pacification gave the king a safe opportunity, he ordered some of the chiefs in the late insurrection to be apprehended, several he put to death, and others he banished or imprisoned. Edgar again escaped into Scotland. The abbot of St Alban's, one of the most zealous of the revolters, died in his place of concealment in the Isle of Ely, on which event the king plundered the monastery.</P>
<P>These severities induced Egelwin to determine on an abdication of his bishopric, and to seek for peace and safety in a foreign country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Symeon, p. 192.—Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 378, 379.</NOTE>. To this end he collect∣ed a considerable treasure from the coffers of the See, and, in the 15th year of his episcopacy, retired secretly from Durham, and took shipping for Cologne; but, by adverse winds, he was driven into Scotland, where he wintered. Whilst in that retreat, he engaged himself to a powerful party, and privily got into the Isle of Ely, where there was a monastery, whose abbot he conceived was his sin∣cere friend. This place being entrenched by nature with a deep morass, was looked upon as an inaccessible retreat, when defended by a sufficient number of troops. Edwin and Morcar<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hoveden.—Lel. Col. v. iii. p. 126, 128.</NOTE>, having received intimation that the king had determined their fate<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 203.—Malms. p. 104.—Iugulph.</NOTE>, withdrew secretly from court, and joined the party in Ely. Edwin, attempting to go into Scotland, was murdered on the road by the treachery of his attendants, who were seduced by some Normans to discover who he was. Those who were now collected in the isle making a powerful body, de∣termined to desend themselves in that station to the last extremity, and there wait for any favourable event which might be in the will of Providence. It seems they had hopes of succour from Denmark; and the Saxon Annals declare, that Sweyn landed a number of troops, but having been permitted by the king to pil∣lage and sweep away the riches of Peterborough monastery, they departed without assisting their deluded friends. The king made a complete circumvallation of troops, by which all relief was cut off from the confederates, and he advanced daily in his attack, by forming a bridge cross the morass, which was two miles in
<PB N="111" REF="156"/>breadth. Notwithstanding all the king's military manoeuvres, the event was doubt∣ful, till, by the treachery of the abbot, he was made master of the key of the isle, and took a bloody vengeance on the malcontents. Morcar he cast into pri∣son, and bishop Egelwin was sent to Abingdon, and there held in close durance. Symeon says, he was frequently admonished to restore to his church the valuable things he had taken from thence; to which he repeatedly on his oath affirmed, that he removed nothing but what was his right. But one day as he washed his hands, there dropped from his right arm, an armilla, or bracelet, which sufficient∣ly proved his perjury. By the king's command he was cast into prison, where, with famine and a broken heart, he died a miserable death. Some authors al∣ledge, he refused to receive any sustenance; others, that it was refused to him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Angl. Saera.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Great inconsistency appears in the various incidents of this prelate's life, from whence it is scarce possible to conceive his real character. Wharton, p. 703, calls him <HI>"Vir generosi animi."</HI> He appears to have been seditious, and busy in secular affairs, and, at the heart, no great stickler for religion.</P>
<P>At this period be it remarked, that no traces have yet appeared of palatine jurisdiction in the bishops of this See, or any acts of civil jurisdiction attending their holy office.</P>
<P>The See of Durham, it is said, continued vacant about a year; but whether that computation is made from Egelwin's abdication or death, is not noticed; neither is it known how long the bishop continued in prison.</P>
<P>This vacancy offers an opportunity of taking a short view of the state of litera∣ture and religion in this province, at that period, and to notice some memorable events. Aldred, archbishop of York, had sufficient virtue of mind to remon∣strate to the king on the oppressions the people suffered under his government, but did not live to receive the courtesy his sovereign had resolved to shew him on that occasion; and perhaps the good purposes to which the king was moved were lost to the public by the prelate's death, who languished with grief for the miseries of his country.</P>
<P>Malmsbury says, that learning and religion<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Malms. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. ii<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. fo. 57.</NOTE> were then little regarded; there was very little scholarship even among the clergy. If they could read the church service, they thought themselves qualified for their function, and seldom carried their education much higher. If any of them understood grammar, he was look∣ed upon as a prodigy of knowledge. The monks forsook the austerities of their order, and became expensive and sumptuous in their diet and habit. The rich among the laity were abandoned to luxury and debauchery; they thought it a hardship to submit to the old customs of devotion, to appear in church at morning prayer, but had matins performed in their bedchambers whilst they were still at repose. The poor were generally made a prey to the wealthy, who treated them without humanity, and as if they were by nature of an inferior creation: They were frequently plundered of their little effects, and sold for slaves to foreign na∣tions. Justice, temperance, and religion, were rare qualities in this aera.</P>
<PB N="112" REF="157"/>
<P>About this period the Synod was held at Winchester, in which it was decreed, that no canon of the church should be married. Those priests who had cures in the country, and were married, were not enjoined to part with their wives; but the bishops were directed, upon ordination, to exact, from priests or deacons, a vow of celibacy to the following purport: <HI>Ego frater</HI> A <HI>promitto Deo omnibusque sanctis ejus, castitatem corporis mei, secundum canonum decreta, et secundum ordinem mihi imponendum servare Domino.

<P>The injuries and insults the king had sustained from the Scottish king, could not be brooked by his impetuous and haughty temper: Therefore, as soon as the confederates in Ely were suppressed, he marched northward with a powerful armament, and penetrated into Galloway. He had a fleet at sea attending his progress, keeping close upon the coast as he advanced<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 381.</NOTE>. Malcolm, on the approach of the English army, retreated from the borders, not being willing to hazard an engagement. He kept at a safe distance, well knowing the enemy could not subsist long in the country, and hoping a diversion would be made in England, which might afford a fortunate moment for striking some blow. The king of Eng∣land had too much penetration not to discover so obvious a project; and there∣fore made no lingering, but pressed forward into the heart of the country. This progress had its desired effect with the English sovereign, for it obliged Malcolm to propose terms of accommodation. The counties of Westmorland and Cum∣berland, which for several reigns had been possessed as fiefs of Scotland, were guaranteed to Malcolm and his successors, and he did homage for the same. Ac∣cording to Hector Boethius, the limits were ascertained by a cross erected on the heights of the desert of Stanmore, the remains of which are yet to be seen in the midst of a large entrenchment, and called Roy Cross.</P>
<P>On the king's return from this expedition, having previously entertained some displeasure against earl Gospatric, he deprived him of his government, under pre∣tence of information that he was accesary to the death of Cumin, and an abettor in the slaughter of the Norman garrison at York. The earl had received intima∣tion of the king's wrath, and knowing him to be implacable, after he had recei∣ved a prejudicial impression against any man, fled into Scotland, and, after a short stay, passed over into Flanders, Malcolm perhaps fearing to entertain him in his territories so soon after a peace concluded with England. But he afterwards re∣turned to Scotland, and then Malcolm gave him Dunbar, with the adjacent lands in Lothian, for the support of himself and household, until better times. He died, and was interred at Norham<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Buchanan charges the English refugees with introducing into Scotland, luxury, pride, wantonness, drunkenness, and other vices, to which, he says, that nation were strangers before their coming.</P>
<P>On Gospatric's deposition, Waltheof was created earl of Northumberland. He was the son of Siward, by Elfreda, the daughter of Aldred; so that he had a double claim to this government<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 381.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="113" REF="158"/>
<P>In the king's return from his Scottish expedition, it is probable the succeeding bishop was elected to this See, at the king's nomination. Symeon speaks of a de∣sign to impose a tax on the church-lands; but the officer of the king's revenue, sent to Durham for that purpose, had a vision, by which he was deterred making any levies on the lands of St Cuthbert<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 195, 196.</NOTE>; and the liberties and privileges of the church were afterwards confirmed, subject to the Norman feudal tenures.</P>
<P>WALCHER<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 331.</NOTE>, who succeeded to the See, was of noble birth in Lorrain, and had received an ex∣cellent education at Liege, from whence he was invited over by the king, to take upon him this episcopacy. His conduct was virtuous and amiable, and his reli∣gious principles in high esteem. With this elevated character he came over to England, in the spring of the year 1072, being of the order of secular clergy, and was consecrated at Winchester<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 193.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The king, whilst on his northern expedition, observed how proper a situation Durham was by nature for being made a barrier against the incursions of the Scots, as also to keep in awe the inhabitants of Northumberland; the country north of Tyne, at that time, as it was during the possession of the Danes, having become the common receptacle of all the abandoned and dissolute wretches of the land, and the followers of those who were discontented with government, and ready on every occasion to take up arms, for the sake of those impious gains which were to be reaped in the times of public confusion and civil war. He therefore ordered a castle to be built at Durham, at once to secure his earl of that pro∣vince from tumults and insurrections, as also to protect the bishop of the See and his church. Whether there was any fortress before that time on the eminence where the present castle stands, is uncertain; but the mount on which the chief tower is erected, appears to be of great antiquity; though Huntingdon's phrase touching the king's erecting a castle there, <HI>"de novo,"</HI> discourages the idea; and yet it is not unfair to venture such a conjecture, from the circumvallations around the mount, the well-known mode of the Saxons. But be this as it may, it is not to be doubted, from the concurrence of the historians, that the king erected a fortress in this place; though the remains of an edifice of that date, or of the Norman mode of architecture, are not now to be traced<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 381. v. iii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Symeon writes, that the king, whilst he abode in Durham, entertaining a doubt of the incorruptible state of St Cuthbert's body, inquired diligently concerning it; and, notwithstanding the asseverations of several of the most pious and venerable men there, he stil pretended to disbelieve it, and insisted on having an inspection of the sepulchre himself. Several bishops and abbots then present assented to his will, and thought it proper the king's pleasure should be complied with. Whether provoked by the delay, or his suspicion of fraud was increased by the reluctance of the ecclesiasties to comply with his desire, is not pointed out; but the king so lemn∣ly
<PB N="114" REF="159"/>wowed, if he was deceived in the relations he had heard, if the incorruptibility of the Saint's remains was merely a tale to work upon the superstition of the vul∣gar, and the body was not found in the state represented to him, he would put to death all those of superior rank throughout the city, who had presumed to impose on him. A terror fell on such as heard his menaces, and they devoutly implored the mercy of God, through the merits of the blessed St Cuthbert, whilst the bishop, with the greatest solemnity, performed the service of high mass. The king, de∣termined to satisfy his curiosity, immediately after the ceremony, commanded the officers of the church to open the sepulchre; and, whilst he stood by, he found himself smitten on a sudden with a burning fever, which distracted him, in an into∣lerable manner. Seized with such anguish and disease, he rushed out of the church, leaving untasted a sumptuous banquet, which the ecclesiastics had prepared for him; and instantly mounting his horse, he fled from the city with the utmost haste, never abating the speed of his courser, till he arrived on the banks of the Tees<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 194.</NOTE>. An in∣dication of God's displeasure, like this, at an attempt to disturb the sacred remains, overawed the people, and contributed greatly to the veneration paid at the Saint's shrine. Tradition says, the king, for haste, took his way down the narrow street called King's-gate, leading into the Bailey. The modern name of this street is Dun-cow-lane, from the sculpture of the memorable cow, on an opposite tower of the church.</P>
<P>Soon after our bishop was settled in his See, one Aldwin a monk of great piety, who had been prior in the monastery of Wincelcomb, zealous to live in stricter rules than those his convent had adopted, and take upon him greater austerities and self-denial, entertained a desire to visit Northumberland, where, in the early ages of the church, so many holy men had lived, and there to obtain some sequestered situa∣tion for his future residence. On his journey he gained two associates, Elfwy and Renfrid, who travelled on foot with him to the north, by turns carrying the neces∣sary books and vestments for celebrating divine service. At first they took up their residence at Munkchester, now Newcastle; but their arrival being made known to the bishop, he sent them an invitation to settle within his territories; as he thought it preferable for them to be under the government of an ecclesiastic than of the civil power. Munkchester, though in the bishop's See, was under the government of the earl of Northumberland. He received them with much honour, and rejoiced that Providence had sent men of their order to abide in the province. He gave them for their residence the monastery dedicated to St Paul the apostle, formerly founded by Benedict at Gyrvum, now Jarrow. The walls were standing uncover∣ed, and scarce any thing remained of its ancient greatness. With all possible ex∣pedition a roof was formed with wood, thatched with straw, and, in a short time, divine services were renewed. They made a loft for their lodgings, and the neces∣sary occupations of household, and were sustained by alms. They were join∣ed by several brethren from the southern parts of the kingdom, but sew from the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th, and speedily the monastery became numerous. As they increased in strength,
<PB N="115" REF="160"/>having a desire to rebuild the church, and restore the ruined monastery, the bishop granted them the vill of Jarrow, with its appendages, viz. Preston, Monkton, Heworth, Hebborn, Wiston, and Hartdun, or Harton<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 202.—Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 382.</NOTE>, to enable them to ef∣fect their pious intention, and live above the meagreness of necessity. Earl Wal∣theof gave Tinmouth to this monastery, and permitted the monks to remove the remains of St Oswin to Jarrow.</P>
<P>After the religious fraternity had flourished at Jarrow some time, from causes not mentioned, but probably dissentions among themselves, or becoming too nu∣merous by the destruction of Weremouth; Aldwin, though dissuaded therefrom by Elfwy with tears and most earnest supplications, with a few followers, resorted to the solemn solitude of the ruined monastery of Melros; and Renfrid, with an∣other party, went to Whitby, whence, after a short residence, and many suffer∣ings from robbers, and other persecutors, they removed to York, and there founded the monastery of St Mary. Elfwy, alone, of the first Benedictine settlers, remained at Jarrow<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 203.</NOTE>. Aldwin suffered much persecution from Malcolm king of Scotland, because he and his brethren, for conscience sake, refused swearing alle∣giance. Bishop Walcher, after many letters and messengers intreating their re∣turn in vain, at length threatened them with excommunication if they disobeyed his injunctions; in terror of which they returned to the See of Durham, and the bishop gave them for their place of residence the monastery of St Peter the A∣postle at Weremouth; a seat described by Bede as being once both ample and noble, though then a melancholy scene of ruins. The monks having erected a habitation of wood and boughs of trees, took up their residence there; and it was in this place that Symeon took on him the habit of a monk. The bishop gave to this religious society the vill of Weremouth, to which his successor after∣wards added Suddick. The naked walls of the church, which it does not appear were done any thing at from the time of the devastation by the Scots, were grown up with brambles and thorns. Those being rooted out, the building repaired, and a roof made, divine services were in a little time restored. From the time the Pagans in their descent on the coast destroyed the churches and monasteries of Northumberland, to the third year of bishop Walcher's episcopacy, when Aldwin began to revive this house in 1075, was a period of 205 years, Symeon says, 208. Such was our bishop's veneration for the order of monks, and for the dignity of religion; such his dislike to having the solemn offices of his episcopal church performed by secular clergy, that he formed a resolution of taking on him that order, displacing the seculars, and bringing monks to the church at Durham. This, in the sequel, contributed not a little to the tragedy which soon after en∣sued<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 208.—Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 383.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But to return to the events of the state. The king's prosperity and greatness excited the malignity even of the Norman chieftains: As is usual with usurpers, the exertions of power, for his own preservation, were arbitrary and severe. His countrymen were aggrandised by the destruction of those English nobles whose
<PB N="116" REF="161"/>lives and actions were a constant stigma to the tyrant's multiplied acts of violence, and their wretchedness pierced the hearts of many, even of those who flourished on their ruin. No rewards can lull the conscious heart from reflection, or great∣ness pervert the soul to praise the evil deeds of a tyrant; not even those by which that greatness exists. The rigour which the Normans experienced, together with the general affliction of the old inhabitants, urged many to enter into a conspiracy against the king, whilst he was absent in Normandy. Waltheof, though he had received such bounties from his sovereign, was a party in this confederacy, and vowed his secret aid and council should attend their projects, though he declined being active in the intended insurrection, as well on account of his obligation to the king, as for fear of a discovery by his lady, who was so near in blood to him. But the earl's conscience would not, on reflection, suffer him to proceed in a plot at once so full of villainy and ingratitude; he discovered the conspiracy to Lan∣franc archbishop of Canterbury, and to Judith his countess, who prevailed on him to go secretly into Normandy, and reveal the whole to the king. The con∣spirators had engaged succours of men and arms from the Danes; but, fearful of the discovery of their plot by earl Waltheof, in whom they had no great con∣fidence, they began their insurrection before the project was well ripened, or the Danish fleet arrived. Those circumstances contributed to the easy suppression of the rebellion, by means of the king's faithful friends at home, and his speedy re∣turn. Many of the chiefs were publicly executed, others mutilated, and deprived of their eyes. The king's prejudices were so implacable, that he never could pardon one in his heart who had offended him; and earl Waltheof, notwithstand∣ing he received the fullest assurances of his majesty's affection, and of restoration to his good esteem, whilst in Normandy, yet a jealousy was implanted in his bo∣som, which no contrition could remove, or good offices eradicate, and which in the end brought on the earl's ruin. It is said the accusations of his countess bore hard upon his fidelity in the last transaction. He was condemned to die; and, after several months imprisonment, was beheaded 29th April 1075, on a hill near Winchester. He was the last Englishman, after the reduction of this country by the Normans, who retained any considerable power or interest in the nation. His riches are said to have been the king's chief object in this execution. Ingulph<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ingulph. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4.</NOTE> says, Ivo de Tailbois, a Norman chief in high favour with his sovereign, had a longing desire for his estates. Hoveden<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 455.</NOTE> speaks of the earl very respectfully; that he lived in the greatest friendship with our bishop, sat in the synods of his clergy, humbly and obediently putting in execution the bishop's decrees for re∣forming religion, within the bounds of his diocese. His body was first interred near the place of execution, but afterwards removed to the chapter-house in the abbey of Croyland<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Dug. Bar. v. i. p. 55.</NOTE>. From this time Malmsbury dates the servitude and depres∣sion of the English; as much Norman as he was, he plainly enough intimates, that, from thence forward, the king had no manner of regard to them. Hence it may be conjectured, this prince's severity to the English was very great and universal,
<PB N="117" REF="162"/>since this historian reckons as a trifle what the king had already done with respect to the spiritual and temporal lords<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rapin, p. 176.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the death of Waltheof, authors agree the bishop purchased of the king the earldom of Northumberland. This is the first instance of the civil power being united in one person, with the ecclesiastic, in this See. The king had created a palatine earldom in Chester, but no record shews a like creation in this province; though it is highly probable our bishop had a palatine jurisdiction granted to him, within the territories of St Cuthbert: And in order that the civil magistracy might not be attended with disputes and wranglings, touching the limits and extent of jurisdiction, with any earl appointed to Northumberland (as St Cuthbert's lands lay straggling in that district, save only those within the confines of Tyne and Tees), it is probable that his obtaining the earldom was for the purpose of a more impartial and regular dispensation of justice throughout the whole province. But, to form some judgment of the nature of this civil jurisdiction, it may be necessary to attend to what has been said by the best authors on the palatine power, the acts of succeeding bishops, in the fullest manner exemplifying the extent of their au∣thority.</P>
<P>It would be useless to go at large into the history and definition of the title and office of an earl, in the Saxon and Danish times, as no traces thereof were an∣nexed to our bishops before the time of the Normans. Those whose love of in∣quiry carries them beyond the present limits, will consult Selden in his titles of honour. He says, <Q>the territories of Northumberland were possessed by its “”earls,</Q> (recounting their names down to Waltheof), <Q>as the king held them “”at the time of their creation.</Q> By which it appears, they were viceroys of the province. Malmsbury says<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Malms. De Gest. Pontis. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. iii.</NOTE>, that Walcher bishop of Durham, under K. Wil. I., was <HI>dux pariter provincioe &amp; episcopus:</HI> On which Selden observes, <Q><HI>dux provincioe</HI> “”may perhaps rather denote sheriff of Northumberland than earl.</Q> The term <HI>earl</HI> became obsolete and out of use on the accession of the Normans, and the of∣fice was sully expressed by the name of <HI>comes,</HI> which then received acceptation. A definition of this title appears in Johannes Sarisburiensis. Speaking of the old notion, that the derivation was had from a participation with the king of one third of the receipts of the sherissdom, says, <Q>Comites a societatis participatione “dici quisquis ignorat, ignoratus est literarum qua literalis institutio primas tra∣dere ”consuevit.</Q><HI>Comites,</HI> in the Roman state, were attendants on the public magistrates, and executors of the law, as their deputies. The ancient mode of an earl's creation, was only <HI>per cincturam gladii comitatus.</HI> But, besides the gird∣ing on of the sword, other ceremonies were used in after times, as luxuries and outside magnificence advanced. Bracton<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Bracton, De rer. divis. l. i. c. 8. s. 2, 3, 4. l. ii. de acquir. rer. dom. c. 16.</NOTE>, speaking of <HI>comites</HI> in general, but having his eye doubtless more especially upon those of his own country, says, they are called <Q>comites, quia a comitatu, sive a societate nomen sumps<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>runt, qui “etiam dici possunt consules a consulendo.

Such was Ethelred's Eal∣dorman of Meroland under king Alfred, and his son king Edward. For though the name of palatine be not found in the Saxon times, yet the sense and substance of it was fully in that earldom: For to the earl palatine, or count de palais, or count paleiz, (as they are sometimes in law-books called), was to have the title of earl, or the seisin of a county or earldom, and <HI>regalem potesta∣tem in omnibus,</HI> under the king, as Bracton well expresses it, where he speaks of granting pardons to felons. <HI>De felone aut probatore nullus prisonam habere po∣terit</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">De Corona, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. iii. c. 3.</NOTE> <HI>nec de co placitum habere nisi ipse Dominus rex, cum nullus alius ei possit vi∣tam concedere vel membra.

Hen. VIII., by which their power of granting pardons, of ma∣king ”writs in their own names, and the like, are taken from them.</Q></P>
<P>The county of Chester was granted to Hugh Lupus, by deed to the following effect: <Q><HI>Gulielmus primus Hugonem cognomine Lupum vice comitis Abrincencis
<PB N="119" REF="164"/>“in Normannia filium primum hereditarum &amp; palatinum Cestriae comitem cre∣avit, totumque hunc comitatum tenendum sibi &amp; heredibus ita liberè ad gla∣dium, ”sicut ipse (rex) totam tenebit Angliam ad coronam</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spel. Glos. p. 143.</NOTE>." Selden observes, That, by this grant, the king's seigniory of the lands of the bishopric, it seems, passed not to him; for, in Doomsday-book, which was written in the time of this earl, the words are, <HI>In Cestresyre tenet episcopus <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jusdem civitatis de rege quod ad suum pertinet episcopatum. Totam reliquam terram comitatús tenet Hugo comes de rege.</HI> But the regal jurisdiction that followed the grant made to earl Hugh was such, that the earls had their courts both of criminal and civil justice; their barons also, as their great council; and every of these barons had <HI>curiam suam liberam de omnibus placitis et querelis in curia comitis motis, exceptis placitis ad gladium ejus pertinentibus;</HI> where his <HI>jus gladii,</HI> or <HI>dignitas gladii,</HI> is expressed: As also in that of the county of Flint; <HI>comitatus Flint pertinet ad gladium Cestriae.</HI> To this day the county palatine of Chester (it being always preserved in the crown as a county palatine when there is no prince of Wales, and it is given to the prince of Wales when he is created) hath had chamberlains, who sup∣ply the place of chancellor; justices before whom the causes, that of their na∣ture should otherwise belong respectively to the king's-bench and common-pleas, are triable; a baron of the exchequer, a sheriff, and other officers pro∣portionably ”to those of the crown at Westminster.</Q> The same author adds, that <Q>in no summons to parliament, or other record, is the earl stiled <HI>palatine;</HI> “”but, from the regal jurisdiction, it gained that acceptation.</Q></P>

These were occasioned from the courage of the inhabitants, that stoutly defended their liberties against the usurping power of those greater kings that endeavoured to have the dominion over the whole heptarchy, and, not being easily overcome, were admitted into composition of tributaries; and therefore are found very ancient; for Alfred put one of his judges to death for passing sentence upon a malefactor for an offence done in a place where the king's writ passed not.—Bacon on government, 73. cap 29.</P>

He bought the earldom of Northumberland of the king, who being merry with him at his creation, said he had done a wonder in making a young earl of an old bishop. Was he then an earl of his bishoprique and earldom, or <HI>county-palatine,</HI> before this creation? And some speak of the creation of Puzar, as if there had been some kind of a perpetual annexing of an earldom in Northumberland to that church. Yet his creation was but for life. Mathew Paris, and some others, expressly say so<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hugo de Puzaz Dunelmensis episcopus emit sibi et ecclesiae suae Northumbriae comitatum in vita sua, qui a rege gladio comitatus accinctus, nomen sibi comitis usurpavit.

The story of Leulfun and Leodwin, under Walcher bishop of Durham, and (as it is taken) earl of Northumberland, in the time of William the First, may give some argument of perswasion to this purpose, &amp;c. &amp;c. In their possessions or earldoms, the earls had such jurisdic∣tion, and other privileges, as they had received by the king's grant, and such power besides as the largeness of their possessions and number of tenants only gave them. But, otherwise, none since the time of the Normans. And for those testimonies before brought, that may seem to perswade the contrary, that Walcher bishop of Durham, if he was earl of Northumberland, was sheriff al∣so. He had <HI>curam comitatis Northimbrensium,</HI> as is already noted; and one Gil∣bert, his kinsman, was his under-sheriff. So Hoveden is to be understood in the same story. <HI>Gilberto, quia suus propinquus erat comitatum Northumbrensium sub se regendum commiscrat.</HI> And it appears he executed such a kind of power as belongs to a sheriff in the county. And if in truth he was earl, yet it is not doubted but that he had the sheriswick also by special grant, as some other earls in those elder times had likewise. And the <HI>vice comes,</HI> or under sheriff, had the charge, as well of <HI>the military defence,</HI> as <HI>civil government</HI> of the coun∣ty.”</Q></P>
<P>The mode of investiture, was the sovereign's girding the earl with a sword, and placing on his head a coronet of gold, after which he was robed by the at∣tendants. Selden doth not trace this investiture further back than the time of K. Edw. III. in the precedents he quotes, but says, it was much more ancient than the express memory of it in charters now extant *.</P>

<P><HI>Palatinus</HI> is used by Hierome Isa. 65, as signifying a nobleman, or <HI>regulus;</HI> and, by the sages of the law, our bishop is stiled <HI>dominus regalis,</HI> who for time imme∣morial hath enjoyed the <HI>jura regalia.</HI> See Rot. Parl. Pasch. 21st Eliz. Rot. 5. which Lord Coke calls a notable record of the liberties of the bishop of Durham, and therefore is allowed for such in the king's court.</P>
<P>As to the personal titles of <HI>comes palatini,</HI> it will suffice to repeat Selden's words<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Selden, p. 685.</NOTE> in one instance: <Q>In the more ancient times, some of the most eminent “officers, being local earls, were yet sometimes stiled <HI>comites,</HI> or <HI>consules palatini,</HI> with relation to the court only, as if that personal title had sufficiently designed them by joining the title of <HI>comites</HI> to a word that generally expressed their personal office. For <HI>palatin</HI> was in that sense used also in England, and not only attributed to the local earls palatin, of whom enough is before said. The origination of this personal title of palatin, as it generally denoted officers of the court, is before shewed in the empire. But, for examples of it in Eng∣land: Odo bishop of Baieux and earl of Kent, under William I., is called <HI>consul palatinus</HI> in <HI>Odericus vitalis,</HI> an Englishman that wrote under king Ste∣phen, <HI>Quid loquar de Odone Bajocasino praesule qui</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Spel.

For he was <HI>totius Angliae vicedominus sub rege,</HI> as William of Malmsbury says of him; and <HI>princeps pala∣tii,</HI> as Ingulphus stiles him; or <HI>curae palatinoe regnique negotiis specialius praepositus,</HI> as the author of Gesta Regis Stephani speaks of Roger bishop of Salisbury.

<P>Lancashire was governed by earls until the time of king Edward III., when the earl of Lancashire was advanced to the dignity of a duke. On the accession of John of Gaunt, fourth son of king Edward III., to this dukedom, the king ad∣vanced the earldom of Lancashire into a palatinate, by patent; the tenor of which sufficiently explains what was the idea of the great officers of the crown, and le∣gal acceptation of that authority in that aera. <HI>We have granted, for us and our heirs, to our son aforesaid, that he, during the term of life, shall have, within the county of Lancaster, his chancery, and his writs to be issued under his own seal belong∣ing to the office of chancellor; his justices likewise, as well for pleas of the crown, as for other pleas relating to common law, to have cognizance of them, and to have power of making all executions whatsoever by his writs and officers; and to have all other li∣berties and royalties, of what kind soever, appertaining to a county-palatine, as freely and as fully as the earl of Chester, within the said county, is known to have."</HI></P>
<P>Notwithstanding the learned Selden's opinion, most authors who have touched upon the subject have determined, that the palatine power of the bishops of Dur∣ham
<PB N="124" REF="169"/>was prescriptive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What was meant in England by the terms of county palatine, must be explained by example and prece∣dent, rather than by definition. As to the earldom of Durham in the 21st year of K. Ed. I. 1293, a great cause was brought before the king and his council, at the king's suit or attachment, touching the behaviour of John archbishop of York, toward Anthony bishop of Durham. The cause was first commenced before the court of king's-bench, then brought before the king's council, and then before the king's council in par∣liament. In the court of king's-bench, Richard de Bretteville, the king's general attorney, pleadeth, amongst other things, that the bishop of Durham hath two states, namely, the state of a bishop, as to spiri∣tualities, and the state of <HI>comes patatii,</HI> an earl of the palace, as to his temporalities: In this process, the archbishop of York admitteth the bishop of Durham's twofold capacity, namely, that of a bishop, united to that of a baron. This twofold capacity the other bishops of England had, as well as Durham; they had a spiritual office, to wit, a bishopric, and a secular dignity, to wit, a barony. The archbishop of York seems to make little or no difference between the bishop of Durham, and the other bishops, in respect of the pala∣tine capacity of the former, and the baronial capacity of the latter; as if men had not at that time in Eng∣land, a distinct notion of the title of a palatine.—Bar.

<P>The occasion of this proceeding against John Roman, archbishop of York, arose from his high misdemea∣nour and usurpation upon the king's crown and dignity, in presuming, the year before, to excommunicate Anthony Beke bishop of Durham, whilst attending on the king's person and service in the northern parts, for his and his servants imprisoning two of his clerks, viz. John de Amelya a public notary, and Win de Melton of Pickering, for bringing a citation to summon the bishop to appear before him, and refusing to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elease them upon his monitions and interdicts, for which he was adjudged to be imprisoned, and to pay a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of 4<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 marks to the king Prynn's K.

Gyllarm.</P></NOTE>; and the editor of Camden hath advanced, <Q>that it proceed∣ed “at first from a principle of devotion to St Cuthbert, that whatever lands were given to him, or bought with his money, he should hold them with the same freedom as the princes who gave them held the rest of their estates. But this piety to the Saint was not without its prudential purposes all along, both for the service of the crown in the wars of Scotland, and also for the service of the country." Our great lawyer, Sir Edward Coke, whose authority we may rest upon, says, "This county-palatine was first raised soon after the time of Wil∣liam ”the Conqueror.</Q> The same cause that occasioned the creation of the county-palatine of Chester, might promote ours. The country was so situated as to make a proper barrier and safeguard against the incursions and depredations of the Scots, on which account it was necessary to repose, in the vicegerent there, those powers and authorities which might best enable him to render essential servi∣ces to the state, in times of public danger, according to the nature of each exi∣gency.</P>
<P>Camden expresses himself on this matter as follows: <Q>Nec minus Gulielmus “Normannus a cujus statim tempore comitatus palatinus indicatus est, et episcopi tanquam comites palatini sigillo insculpserunt militem cataphractarium phalarato equo insidentem altera manu gladium vibrantem, altera insignia episcopatus praetendentem cum inscriptione, <HI>Crux veritati comes.</HI> Juraque sua regalia habu∣erunt episcopi, adeo ut proscriptorum bona illis non regi cederent, &amp; ipsa plebs ”immunitatibus elata merere in Scotia sub rege recusarit.</Q></P>
<P>Among modern writers, it may not be amiss just to take a short view of what is said on this head by one or two of the most judicious. Speaking of the Franks, from whom many customs are derived, Sullivan says,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sullivan's Lectures, p. 51.</NOTE>, <Q>But as it was unsafe to “trust the government of those new subjects in the hands of one of their nation, the king appointed annually one of his companions, or <HI>comes,</HI> for that purpose,
<PB N="125" REF="170"/>in a certain district; and this was the origin of counties and counts. The busi∣ness of these lords was to take care of, and account for the profits of the king's demesnes, to administer justice, and account for the profits of the courts, which were very considerable, as the Roman laws about crimes being by degrees super∣seded, and consequently capital punishment in most cases abolished, all offences became fineable, a third of which they retained to themselves. They also, in ”imitation of the lords of the Franks, led their followers to the wars.</Q></P>
<P>As to the offices of earls and counts palatine, he speaks thus: <Q>The office of “these counts was threefold; to judge the freemen in peace, to conduct them in war, to manage the king's demesnes in their respective districts, and to account with him for them and the profits of his courts of justice, which were very considerable, when all offences were punished by fines. Their first constitution must be referred to the time of the division of England into counties, to which they had a reference, which is generally ascribed to Alfred. Their power and office was exactly the same with the counts on the continent in those early times, namely, to judge and lead the free men to war; for the greatest part of the lands of England were at that time allodial (paying neither fines or rendering ser∣vices), as is proved by Spelman, contrary to the opinion of Sir Edward Coke; although with him it must be allowed, that there were fiefs also before the con∣quest, and that they were not all introduced at that period. But William hav∣ing turned all the lands into feudal, was obliged to put his earls on the same footing that those on the continent were in his time, and consequently to make them hereditary. But, to prevent the too great influence which their judging in person might acquire to them in their districts, officers chosen by the people, and approved by the king, were substituted to administer justice, under the names of <HI>vice-comites,</HI> or sheriffs: These were to pay to the king two-thirds, and to the earl his third, of the profits, which was in those times look∣ed upon as so incident to an earldom as to pass with it, although express words were wanting; so that, in those times, an earl and a county were co-relatives." The effect of the creation of counties palatine, was to have <HI>jura regalia;</HI> for the earl-palatine might pardon treason, murder, and other offences; might make justices of assize, gaol delivery, and of the peace; might create barons of his county-palatine, and confer knight-hood. They had likewise all forfei∣tures that arose by the common-law, or by any prior statute; but forfeitures arising from statute made after the erection of the county-palatine, belonged to the king. They had courts as the king had at Westminster, and out of their chancery issued all writs, original and judicial. Neither did the king's writ run within the county-palatine, except writs of error, which are in the nature of appeals; or in cases where otherwise there would be a failure of justice. All manner of indictments and processes were made in their name, and every tres∣pass was laid to be done against the peace of him that had the county-pala∣tine. But these, and some other privileges, have been taken away, and an∣nexed to the crown, in whose name they must now be; but the teste of the ”writs is still in the name of the earl-palatine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sullivan, lect. xxi. p. 197, &amp;c.—Baron.

<P>Judge Blackston, in his Commentaries, speaking of counties palatine, delivers himself to this effect: <Q>Counties palatine are so called <HI>a palatio;</HI> because the own∣ers “thereof, the earl of Chester, the bishop of Durham, and the duke of Lan∣caster, had, in those counties, <HI>jura regalia</HI> as fully as the king hath in his pa∣lace: <HI>Regalem potestatem in omnibus,</HI> as Bracton expresses it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>act. l. iii. c. 3.</NOTE>. They might par∣don treasons, murders, and felonies; they appointed all judges and justices of the peace; all writs and indictments ran in their names, as in other counties in the king's; and all offences were said to be done against their peace, and not, as in other places, <HI>contra pacem domini regis</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st. p. 204.</NOTE>.

These palatine privileges (so similar to the regal in∣dependent jurisdictions usurped by the great barons on the continent, during the weak and infant state of the first feodal kingdoms in Europe<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtson, v. i. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 60.</NOTE>), were, in all probability, originally granted to the counties of Chester and Durham, be∣cause they bordered upon enemies countries, Wales and Scotland, in order that the owners, being encouraged by so large an authority, might be more watch∣ful in its defence; and that the inhabitants, having justice administered at home, might not be obliged to go out of the country, and leave it open to the enemies incursions." "Notwithstanding their abridged power by late statutes, the reason for their continuance in a manner ceasing, still all writs are witnessed in their names, and all forfeitures for treason, by the common-law, accrue to them<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">4th Just. p. 205.</NOTE>. Of the three, the county of Durham is now the only one remaining ”in the hands of a subject.</Q> Vol. i. p. 117.</P>
<P>It was an ancient maxim, <HI>Quiequid rex habet extra comitatem Dunelmensem, episco∣pus habet infra, nisi aliqua sit concessio aut praescriptio in contrarium.</HI> The bishops had great extent of power, as the several records hereafter to be pointed out, in suc∣cession as they fall under every episcopacy, will evince. They had power to levy taxes for the defence and service of the palatinate, and make truces with enemies; to raise defensible troops, within the liberty, from 16 to 60 years of age, and to impress ships for war. They sat in judgment of life and death, and held execu∣tion by life or limb. They had power to create barons, who, with their vassals, were bound to attend the bishop's summons in council: And thence may be ob∣served, the greatest part of the lands within the liberty are held of the bishop as lord paramount <HI>in capite.</HI> They coined money, granted licences to embattle castles, build churches, sound chantries and hospitals, instituted corporations by charter, to which the crown's assent was not essential to maintain their legality; and granted markets, fairs, &amp;c. They had all manner of royal jurisdiction, both civil and military, by land and by water, for the exercise whereof they held pro∣per courts, and appointed officers and other ministers of every department, as well such as the crown nominates without the liberty, as such as the king has been used to depute, according to the exigency of special cases, or for the special exe∣cution
<PB N="127" REF="172"/>of acts of parliament. The bishop's officers by patent are, the temporal chancellor, to whom belonged the care of the levies, the custody of the armour, and pay of the troops; constable of Durham Castle, the great chamberlain, under chamberlain, secretary, steward, treasurer, comptroller of the household, master of the horse, stewards of the manors and halmot court, sheriff, prothonotary, clerks of the chancery, crown, and peace; keeper of the rolls, cursitor, registers, and examiners in chancery, clerk of the county-court, stewards of borough-courts, escheators, feodaries, auditors, and under auditors; clerks of the receipts of the exchequer, supervisors of lordships, castles, mines of coal, lead, and iron: coroners, conservators of ports and rivers; officers of the marshal sea, clerks of markets, keepers of the great feal, of ulnage, of his wardrobe and harness, and master armourer. He had several forests, chaces, parks, and woods, where he had his foresters, who held courts in his name, and determined matters relative to forests; parkers, rangers, pale-keepers. He was lord high-admiral of the sea and waters within and adjoining the county-palatine; had vice-admirals, and courts of admiralty; judges to determine according to the maritime law; registers, examiners, officers of beaconage, anchorage, &amp;c. and he awarded commissions to regulate waters, and passages thereon. <Q>Thus, by themselves and officers, they “did justice to all persons, in all cases, without either the king, or any of his bailiffs or officers interfering ordinarily in any thing. Whatever occasion the king had within this liberty, his writs did not run here; they were not directed as to his own officers in other counties, but to the bishop himself, or, in the va∣cancy of the See, to the proper officers of the palatinate. When king Hen. II. sent his justices of assize hither upon an extraordinary occasion of murders and robberies, he declared by his charter, that he did it with the licence of the bi∣shop, and <HI>pro hac vice tantum,</HI> and that it should not be drawn into custom ei∣ther in his time or in the time of his heirs, not being done but upon absolute necessity; and that he would nevertheless have the lands of St Cuthbert to en∣joy ”their liberties and ancient customs as amply as ever<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gibson's Camd. p. 935.
<P>The statute <HI>de prerogativa regis, cap.</HI> 1. takes notice of Tyne and Tees as the boundaries of the county-palatine; and, in granting to the king the custody of the lands of infant heirs of tenants <HI>in capite,</HI> there is an exception of the privilege and right of the bishop of Durham in his county-palatine.</P>
<P>The bishop of Durham having a county-palatine by prescription, was entitled, by the like prescription, to escheats and forfeitures for treason. Then comes the act of the 25th K. Ed. III. to declare what should be treason, and gives to the king the forfeiture as well of lands held of him as of others, without any saving of the rights of other persons: Yet this act, being only declaratory of the common-law as to the treasons, was adjudged to be only declaratory as to the forfeitures, and gives no new right; nor does it take from the bishop his ancient right. Dy. 288.</P>
<P>After this comes the statute 26th K. Hen. VIII. which carries the forfeiture to estates <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aile, and those the bishop shall not have, but the king, the bishop having no right before to that forfeiture. Dy. 288. 3d Inst. 19. 3d Bul. 157.</P>

They regarded the bishop, from his civil capacity, in a light they had never seen any of St Cuthbert's suc∣cessors; and from their hatred to one of his characters, lost their reverence for the other. The veneration in which the people were accustomed to hold their bishop, was dreadfully shaken when they saw the holy prelate taking on him the exercise of legal severities, and enforcing the laws of the usurper, whose name, character, and cruelties, they held in the utmost detestation. Some of the monastic writers charge the bishop with a perversion of justice, not determining causes which came before him according to their merits, but to gratify some sinister purposes, by which he and his officers accumulated much wealth from the oppression of the sub∣ject;
<PB N="129" REF="174"/>whereby the popular odium was encreased against him to such a degree of madness, as nothing but blood could satiate *. Symeon endeavours to screen his character, and lay an imputation on his ministers, as if he was not even accessary by a privity to their crimes. He says, he was a man of moral life, and, for vir∣tue and good manners, worthy the affection of the best of men. It is certain, from all authorities, he made a very improper choice of ministers and favourites. His kinsman, Gilbert, was entrusted in the administration of the earldom, and his chaplain, Leofwin, was his archdeacon in ecclesiastical matters, and chief con∣fident in all private affairs. This author charges the latter with purloining much of the ornaments and treasures of the church, and distributing them amongst his kinsfolks. Of the former, he says his soldiers treated the people with intole∣rable insolence, taking away by force whatever their wantonness of power dictated, and putting to death even those of higher birth. A Saxon nobleman, whose name was Liulph<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 208.</NOTE>, eminent for his personal virtues, possessions, and great al∣liance (he having married Algitha, sister of Elfleda, wife of earl Siward, and mo∣ther of Waltheof), was in great favour with the bishop, being frequently one of his council, and at his table<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">From whom the barons Lumley are descended.</NOTE>. When Gilbert afflicted the province by frequent rapine and oppression, it was conceived his evil actions were supported by the connivance of the bishop. Amidst the indiscriminate depredations of the deputy, Liulph's estates suffered part of the marks of the spoiler's hand, on which he ap∣plied to the bishop, with remonstrances against the improper conduct of his <HI>vice∣comes</HI> and archdeacon<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 383.</NOTE>. The jealousy and resentment of the Norman favourites thenceforth were grievously excited; and Leofwin thinking himself particularly affronted by Liulph's repeated charges to the bishop, solicited Gilbert to put him to death. This, from an equal spirit of resentment, he readily undertook; and, besetting his house with troops in the night-time, put Liulph to the sword, with the greatest part of his family. This act of violence encreased the tumult of the Northumbrians, by whom Liulph was greatly revered and beloved, and they anxiously waited a proper opportunity to revenge the horrid massacre of this illus∣trious and innocent family. It was in vain for the bishop to attempt appeasing the enflamed minds of the populace, by the most solemn asseverations of his inno∣cence, and detestation of the crime. He did not bring the perpetrators to justice, notwithstanding the anger which he expressed against the offence, but, negligent of the rights of the injured, he suffered the guilty persons still to go at large, and ex∣ecute the high offices they held; which appearances determined the judgment of the people, that the crimes were perpetrated by his connivance, and with his pri∣vity It is probable he might not be anxious to relax any part of the severities of his government, thinking he should thereby bring the Northumbrians earlier to submission.</P>
<P>Not long after the foregoing transaction, the bishop, in exercise of his civil juris∣diction, held a public assembly of his council and ministers at Gateshead, whither the suitors repaired; and although the following catastrophe, Symeon says, was
<PB N="130" REF="175"/>predicted to him by a man risen from the dead at Ravensworth, yet he went thither without a sufficient military force to secure him from injury, depending on the ve∣neration hitherto paid to the sacredness of his office<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m. Dun. p. 209.</NOTE>. The appearance of the people immediately indicated their disposition for mischief; they were not to be re∣strained, were insolent and refractory. The bishop was at length alarmed for his safety, when it was too late to procure succour. He caused his officers to assure the people, that part of the business of the assembly was to make restitution to the relations of the deceased. The rage of the populace encreased to such a height, that at length he offered to bring Leoswin to trial, that the law might determine his fate. But the mob were so tumultuous and instamed, they refused to submit to the common forms of justice. The bishop perceived it was too late to appease them; their ferocity of temper displayed a total contempt of his official authority as earl, or sanctity as bishop; they beset the house with a clamour which struck the whole assembly with terror; and, on a watchword being pronounced from every quarter, which some of the monastic authors have recorded, <HI>Short red, good red, flea ye the bishoppe,</HI> they discovered their arms, which hitherto were concealed under their garments. The few guards the bishop brought with him, dreading no mischief, on their arrival dispersed themselves, and were reposing here and there in a negligent manner; Such were surrounded, and put to the sword. The bishop privately retreated to the church, whither he summoned a few of the chief men of each party, to propose terms of amity and satisfaction. Those who conceived they could influence the mob, went out to appease them, but, without respect of persons, many were slain. The bishop commanded Gilbert to go forth, and endeavour to reconcile their wrath, but he was an unmediate victim to their vengeance. Some of the rioters set fire to the church, whilst others guarded the door, and put every one to death that attempted to depart. Those who re∣mained within, no longer able to endure the force of the flames, rushed out, and were instantly slain. The last of the assembly was the venerable prelate; his heart was overwhelmed with affliction for the death of his people: Whilst his benevolence lamented their unhappy exit, he denied all the feelings his own approaching fate might have inspired in a less generous bosom; for he could not hope that his life would be spared by the savage and mad multitude. Between the impending evils, for a moment, he was indeterminate what death he should die. The fire urged him to the sword of the enemy; the enemy drove him back to the flames. At length no time was left to irresolution. The fire blazed upon him on every hand. Putting up a short prayer to Heaven, he advanced towards the howling and clamorous multitude. With one hand he made a fruitless signal to command si∣lence; with the other, he sanctified himself with the sign of the cross; and, fold∣ing himself in his robe, he veiled his face, and was instantly pierced to the heart with a lance. The venerable, the awful remains of the man, did not stay their brutality: His death did not satiate their vengeance; for they inhumanly mangled his body with their swords<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Angl Sac. p. 704.—Symeon, p. 213.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="131" REF="176"/>
<P>This catastrophe happened on the 14th day of May 1080, the bishop having held the See nine years and two months. The leader of the riot was E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>duls, surnamed Rus, great-grandson of earl Uchtred, and consequently of a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>linity with Liulph. It is said he killed the bishop with his own hand, and soon afterwards died by the hands of a woman, and was buried at Jedword; from which place of sepulture his body was afterwards cast out by the command of Turgot, when prior <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Durham, and left to 10t upon the earth. It is mentioned, with some probabi∣lity, that the secular clergy, fearful of being displaced from the church at Durham, assisted to spirit up the discontent of the people against our bishop's administration, and not a little contributed to enflame them to their violent proceedings.</P>
<P>The death of the bishop being told to the monks of Jarrow, they took a boat and came to the place, where they found the remains of their prelate, scarce to be known from his wounds. They conveyed the body to their monastery, and from thence to Durham, where they gave it private sepulture in the chapter-house. The rioters, after these execrable acts of violence, immediately repaired to Dur∣ham, and beset the castle, where they met with a valiant resistance. Having used every effort to reduce the fortress, for four days, in vain, they dispersed them∣selves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Symeon, p. 216.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The king was highly provoked by the traiterous actions of the Northumbrians, and sent down into the north his brother Odo, bishop of Baieux, with a large body of troops, to punish those guilty of the outrage, and to take vengeance for the massacre of the bishop and his people. Odo, Symeon says, <HI>tunc a rege secun∣dus fuerat,</HI> was his chief justiciary; and, having crossed the Tyne, the chiefs of the offenders being fled at his approach, he wasted the country, put many to death, and mutilated others, who were of consanguinity to the murderers, and could not pay the price set on their heads; amongst whom many innocent wretches suf∣fered under the avenger's sword. According to Symeon's description, he deso∣lated that part of the province so as to reduce it to a dreary solitude and desert. He reflects on the memory of Odo in this expedition, asserting, he took from the church, under a pretence of lodging it safe in the castle, one of its greatest orna∣ments, for admirable workmanship and curious materials, being a pastoral staff, made of sapphire; which fraud was attempted to be covered by a report that it was stolen by some of the soldiers<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 84.—Sym p 217.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>During Walcher's episcopacy the king gave many rich gifts to the church. He caused the crucifix presented by Tosti to be adorned anew with gold and gems<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 13<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. He gave a see<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cam.</NOTE> of gold, and a precious robe to the service of the church. He re∣stored Billingham, which had been forcibly with-held for many years; and gave to St Cuthbert, for ever, Hoveden, and also Waltham, with its noble monastery and church. In this reign, one Scot gave Aclam, Acleam, or Acley, to the church, with its appendages<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i. p. 332.—Symeon, p 97.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the last year of Walcher's episcopacy, that great survey, or terrier of the lands of England, called the Doomsday-book, was begun; and, what is singular,
<PB N="132" REF="177"/>Durham, Northumberland, and Cumberland, are not inserted therein. Many conjectures have been made to account for this omission. Cumberland was then a fief of Scotland, and Durham and Northumberland were so wasted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rapin.</NOTE> and de∣stroyed, as not to be esteemed worth the expence of a survey. This is plausible: But may it not be objected, that all the country from York to Durham is in this survey, though laid waste for nine years. Our country, most probably, was omit∣ted, as being a territory granted to the church, with all immunities, save military service, and over which the civil jurisdiction was now vested in the bishop, as palatine. Indeed Chester makes part of the survey, and was a palatinate. The bishop was then, it is presumed, created palatine; had the arraying of the mili∣tary, and the services of his barons. The levies and taxes were under his au∣thority; and the interposition of regal powers, from that event, appears to be no longer of use here. These facts being left with the reader, his own judgment must suggest the cause of the omission<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Walcher, consecrated, A.

<P>After Walcher's death, the See of Durham continued vacant for some short time, during which period Northumberland experienced all the severities of war. That territory, devoted to the horrid executions of the sword, was almost depopulated by the vengeance of Odo; and no sooner had he ceased his devastations and cru∣elty, than it was entered by Malcolm, who having received the murderers of bishop Walcher, pursued Odo in his retreat, and harrassed the rear of his army; or, as Fordun says, put the flying party to the rout, and proceeded into Yorkshire, where they collected a rich booty. The king sent his eldest son Robert against the in∣vaders, who having information of his approach, retreated slowly before his army, giving him no opportunity of coming to action. The prince, by laborious marches, penetrated Scotland as far as Eglesbreth, without effecting any thing material<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Fordun, lib. v. c. 21.</NOTE>.

<P>After a vacancy of six months and nine days, from the death of Walcher<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun.— Chr. Mailr. p. 160.—Brompt. p. 977.</NOTE>, the king, on the 9th November 1080, nominated to this bishopric
<PB N="133" REF="178"/>WILLIAM DE CARILEPHO, abbot of the monastery of St Vincent the martyr in Normandy. He was conse∣crated, on the 3d of January following, by Thomas archbishop of York, at Glou∣cester, in the presence of the king, and all the bishops of the realm<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Angl. Sac. p. 704.— Symeon, p. 217.—Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 332.</NOTE>. From his excellent genius and parts, he soon gained his sovereign's confidence and favour, and was made chief justice of the realm. He came to the bishop∣ric after the horrid devastations before mentioned, when much of the district was laid waste, and the distraction occasioned by his predecessor's death was not fully subsided. With the assistance of the king, and by an exertion of his own superior abilities, he soon restored the See to peace, and regulated the disorders which had crept into the administration of his province. Pope Gregory, by his bull directed to the king, commanded an establishment of the See of Durham, with all its pos∣sessions, by royal charter, and that the bishop should therein enjoy, within his territories, all similar royal liberties and dignities as the king held by his crown in other parts of his realm; freed, exempted, and acquitted, of all services and other impositions. And thereupon the king, by his charter made in council A. D. 1082, confirmed to the bishop the laws and rights of St Cuthbert, and granted all such things as were commanded by the precept of the Holy See<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Omnes <HI>dignitates et libertates quae ad regis coronam pertinent ab omni servicio &amp; inquietudine impertuum li∣beras munitas &amp; quietas.—Bulla.</HI>—Et omnia quae Dnus Papa <HI>in suis literis precepit.—Chart.</HI>
<P>This bull and charter are not in being, but the evidence thereof was insisted upon by the bishop of Dur∣ham in his chancery, in a cause there lately depending, touching the liberties of the manor of Seaton Carew, from a recital thereof in one of the grants from a bishop of Durham to the prior and convent, entered in one of their chartularies.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Having gained leisure to attend to the affairs of his church, in the year 1082 he granted Jarrow and Weremouth to the monks there, and confirmed to them whatsoever his predecessor Walcher had given to their monasteries, to hold the same in as ample a manner as he himself held the rest of his territories.

<P>In the following year the bishop proceeded to accomplish what his predecessor began, to dispossess the secular clergy, and place monks in his episcopal church.

Geoffrey, bishop of Courtance in Normandy, succeeded to this earldom.

<P>In the same year with our prior died king William the First. During the last seven years of his reign, the only matter met with in history concerning Northum∣berland is, that, on an alarm given him of an intended invasion, which Canute king of Denmark was preparing, the king brought over from the continent a great army of foreign mercenaries, for the defence of his dominions here, of which several thousands were stationed in Northumberland. After all that this miserable country had suffered, those soldiers had orders to waste and plunder it, that the invaders might find no subsistence therein. The expedition this foreign power was preparing against England, was frustrated by domestic troubles and ad∣verse winds; so that all but the devoted land of Northumberland escaped the dread∣ful effects of the war which was threatened.</P>
<P>Our bishop, on the accession of William Rufus, still retained his office and ho∣nours at court, and, by some authors, was stiled prime minister. A great de∣fection appeared among the Norman barons, in the spring succeeding the corona∣tion, who declared for Robert, the late king's eldest son, and insurrections were fomented in various parts of England. Odo bishop of Baieux, the king's uncle, was the chief of the malcontents; and, by his influence and oratory, drew many into his plot for placing Robert on the throne. But the king, by the attention and assiduity of Lanfranc archbishop of Canterbury, having been put in posses∣sion of the royal treasures, and conducted in various prudential measures, soon crushed the rebellion, which appeared so formidable at its outset. William bishop of Durham, and Moubraie earl of Northumberland, were among the insurgents. The king, after prevailing against the southern powers, sent an army into the north, which laid siege to the Castle of Durham, and soon reduced it, obliging the bishop to fly into Normandy. Moubraie was with his uncle Geoffrey in the Castle of Bristol, but it is uncertain what was his lot, on its surrender.</P>
<P>The See, during the bishop's absence, was governed by the prior of Durham; but the temporalities were seized to the king's use. Ivo Tailbois, and Erneisus
<PB N="137" REF="182"/>de Burone, took possession of the Castle of Durham, with the territories thereto belonging, on the 13th of December. The king not only seized the lands between Tyne and Tees, but he severed from the See Hoveden and Welton in Yorkshire, and gave them to Odon <HI>(Comes campaniae),</HI> and Alan earl of Richmond. The prior and convent were not molested by the king's officers, but permitted to enjoy their property in peace. During this vacancy the monks built their refectory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 386.—Sym. Dun. p. 235.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The troubles in the state being now put an end to, the king, well knowing the indolence and mildness of his brother Robert's disposition, formed a project to dispossess him of Normandy. In the execution of this scheme, some of the king's troops were besieged in a fortress not capable of long resistance, and were reduced to great extremities, when, by the interposition of our bishop, the garri∣son was preserved from the sword. Soon afterwards a peace was concluded, and, for this meritorious service, the bishop was received again into the royal fa∣vour<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 386.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Before the king's return from Normandy, Malcolm of Scotland, expressing a dissatisfaction at his usurpation, seized the occasion of his absence, and entering by Northumberland, invaded England. Moubraie earl of Northumberland, with other chiefs of the northern parts, raising a powerful army, impeded his pro∣gress, though he had time to send off parties with great booty into Scotland. The king being informed of those transactions, hastened to England, where he arrieved in the month of August; and soon after moved with a large fleet and army to chastise the northern foe for this violence. The season was unpropitious to an at∣tempt of this nature: A storm happened a few days before Michaelmas, in which the fleet was almost totally wrecked; and the army, by the severity of the season, and scarcity of provisions, suffered very greatly. Yet notwithstanding those un∣favourable circumstances, a peace was negociated between the contending powers, and Malcolm did homage to the king, on having confirmed to his crown twelve towns in England, and an annual pension of twelve marcs of gold, as it was settled in the preceding reign, on Cumberland being resigned to the crown of Eng∣land. It was on this expedition the king restored the bishop of Durham to his See, on the 11th day of September, A. D. 1091<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 236.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the year following, new disturbances arising between the two kingdoms, the king of Scotland again entered Northumberland, and wasted the whole district as far as Alnwick, where he and his son were slain. Various accounts are given of this tragical blow; the most probable attribute it to an ambuscade formed by a detachment of Earl Moubraie's troops in garrison at Bambrough<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See the accounts of this transaction in the View of Northumberland.</NOTE>. This event produced great revolutions in the state of Scotland; and, in the end, the happy accession of Edgar, son of king Malcolm Canmore, was the consequence.</P>
<P>The bishop, in his exile, was not negligent of his episcopal church; for, on his return, he presented thereto, various sacred vessels, and other ornaments of gold and silver, together with a valuable collection of books.</P>
<PB N="138" REF="183"/>
<P>On the bishop's restoration, the lands severed from the See by the king were restored; Alverton, which had been given by his majesty soon after his accession, and during his displeasure taken away, with Hoveden and Welton, were given up. The bishop soon afterwards granted to his convent of Durham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Symeon, p. 234.—Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 332, 386.</NOTE>, the vill of Kel∣ton; also the vills of Wisfelington (Willington) and Wall's-end, Fenham and Nor∣ham, north of Tyne; with the church of the Holy Trinity in the city of York; and also renewed his grant to the prior and convent of Elvet, in the suburbs of Durham, <HI>in the order of a borough,</HI> that there they might have, to their proper, use, forty merchants houses, or tradesmen's shops, freed for ever from all duties and services to the bishop and his successors; and also gave to them the churches of Elvet, Acliff, Haselden and Dalton, Hoveden and Welton, Walkington and Bran∣tingham in Yorkshire; with the tythes belonging thereto; and also confirmed to them what his predecessor had granted to their monasteries of Jarrow and Weremouth<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib.

His munificene was unlimited; for, not content with giving these rich presents and noble ornaments, he brought over from Normandy the plan of a new church, devised in the stile and magnificence used on the continent; and, in the year 1093, he began the erection of the stately edifice yet remaining at Dur∣ham. The foundation was laid at the time Malcolm made his journey to the Eng∣lish court, previous to his last fatal expedition to Alnwick; as, in the offices of laying the first stones of this sacred edifice, Malcolm is named with the bishop, and Turgot the prior. In those days the holy architects performed this part of their duty with the most solemn and religious rites: <HI>Facta cum fratribus oratione, ac data benedictione, fundamenta coeperunt sodere</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sym.

<P>During the time of those great distractions in Scotland, occasioned by the death of Malcolm and his son, earl Robert Moubraie incurred the displeasure of his sovereign, by associating with William D'Eu, and other Norman lords, in a conspiracy for deposing him, and advancing to the throne Stephen count of Aumale, or Albemarle, the son of a sister of K. Wil. I. The king, in∣formed of the plot, summoned the earl to attend, at his peril, at the court, on the approaching festival of Whitsuntide; but, elated with his late atchievement at Alnwick<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Hunting. p. 373.</NOTE>, he refused to attend without hostages, and safe conduct being granted to him by the crown. The king, enraged at this insolence, marched northward with his army; and, after a siege of two months, reduced the castle of Tinemouth, where he took prisoners the earl's brother and almost all his chief retainers. But advancing to Bambrough, where he held a strong garrison in
<PB N="139" REF="184"/>person, the king, on viewing the fortress, had the mortification to hear it pro∣nounced, by his engineers, impregnable. The only manoeuvre he found expedient was to erect a fort, in the neighbourhood of the castle, called a Malvoisin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Englished,</HI> An ill neighbour.</NOTE>, where a few troops could annoy the garrison, by interrupting their supplies of provisions, and cutting off their foraging parties. Leaving some trusty friends on this com∣mand, he moved southward with the chief body of his army. The earl making an excursion at night with a small troop of horse, in hopes of surprising Newcastle on Tyne, was pursued by part of the troops of Malvoisin, and obliged to change his route to Tinmouth, where with a small party the sustained a siege of six days. Hav∣ing received a wound in his leg, which disabled him from duty, and his attendants being dispirited and unrelieved, they surrendered the castle, and were all made pri∣soners. The king directed, that the earl should be led before the walls of Bam∣brough, which his wife, and Morael his lieutenant, still held; that the garrison be summoned to surrender, or otherwise the earl's eyes instantly be put out, in their presence. This menace had the desired effect; the place was delivered up to the king's troops, and Morael received his pardon; but the unhappy earl was commit∣ted prisoner to the castle of Windsor, where he languished thirty years, and died.— Thus ended the numerous succession of viceroys and earls of Northumberland; the government of that province being, from thenceforth, in the hands of the crown, save only in those instances of interruption hereafter to be pointed out<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 332, 385, 386.—Scale Chron, v. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Two years after the changes in Northumberland, Edgar, the eldest surviving son of Malcolm, was, by the aid of the king of England, restored to the possession of his father's throne, without much bloodshed. This great event the monks of Dur∣ham<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Fordun, l. v. c. 30.</NOTE> ascribed to the protection of their patron Saint. It seems the bishop of Durham, on his assumption of palatine jurisdiction, had displayed a military stand∣ard, similar to that used by a sovereign prince, which was called the banner of St Cuthbert. In Edgar's expedition is the first instance of its being named by histo∣rians; for it is said, as Edgar was on his march towards Scotland, he had a vision of the Saint, who promised him the protection of Heaven, directing him to ob∣tain his banner from the convent, and display it on his march at the head of his army, assuring him his enemies should sly before him. The whole revelation was observed, and the happy event succeeded. The king, in testimony of his grati∣tude, granted to the convent the place and lands of Coldingham, with several ad∣jacent villages, whose names, as mentioned in the grant, are known, with little variation of spelling, to this day. The ancient abbey and monastery were restored; a colony of monks, some short time afterwards, was sent from the church at Dur∣ham; and the priory of Coldingham continued, for several ages, to depend there∣on as a cell. Edgar assisted in person to dedicate the church to the blessed Virgin; and, on that occasion, made to the church, and the monks of St Cuthbert, a gift of some additional lands in the Merse, called the lands of Swinton, as they had been possessed by Liulph, together with twenty-four beasts for tilling them anew. By two other charters he granted Paxton and Fishwic, with the lands lying between
<PB N="140" REF="185"/>Horndean and Knapdean. He ordained the like privilege of sanctuary to Col∣dingham, being 37 days, as possessed by the churches of Holy Island and Norham; and gave the annual pension of half a mark of silver to the monks of Coldingham, from every plough in Coldinghamshire; to which tax the possessors of the lands voluntarily submitted, and engaged themselves to the king for payment thereof<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anderson's Dipl. pl. 6, 7.</NOTE>. The founding of Coldingham by king Edgar, is confirmed by two ancient char∣ters, made by one Thor, an eminent person in those days, who, for his stature, had the epithet of Longus, and is a witness, in the charter of Edgar, relative to this dedication. Thor's charters mention, that, with the aid of his prince king Edgar, he founded the church of Eadnaham, in honour of St Cuthbert; which church was always a member of the spirituality of Coldingham. The seals are curious. The prior of Coldingham was presented by the convent of Durham, and was admitted to his spiritualities by the archbishop of St Andrew's, and to the temporalities by the king of Scotland. This priory came to be one of the most extensive and richest benefices in the kingdom of Scotland<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">King William Rufus causid king Edgar of Scotland to give Coldyngham, that was one of his chiefest maners, to the College of S.

<P>The prior and monks would have granted him sepulture within the walls of their church, as he had been so great a benefactor thereto; but, with a reli∣gious modesty, he absolutely refused to infringe the ancient rule established there, in honour of the remains of St Cuthbert, that no one should be buried within the same edifice; and left his solemn and death-bed injunction to his monks, that he should be interred in the chapter-house at Durham: And accordingly he was laid on the north-side of it, on the 16th day of the same month; all his succes∣sors lying in the same place, until the year 1311. This prelate held the See of Durham fifteen years and two months<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Symeon, p. 246.—Ang. Sac. p. 701.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>notwithstanding what Symeon says of our bishop's protection of the rights of his church, Tynemouth, which earl Alberius confirmed to the See, was wrested from thence by earl Moubraie, and given to St Alban's, during his episcopacy.</P>
<P>This prelate's character was deformed by inconsistencies, which his virtues and excellent genius promised should not have escaped him. Wharton says, his mind was enriched with the noblest gifts of genius, erudition, eloquence, and wit; and, in the quickness of his parts through every department of his office, there was none superior to him. But this excellent picture is blotted by a charge<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Eadmer.—Malms. &amp;c.</NOTE> too well grounded; that, amidst all those valuable endowments of mind, he was de∣stitute of integrity and fidelity, and had no bounds to his ambition; for though his gratitude should have held him fast to his sovereign, he forgot all his royal bounties, and joined with the rebel Odo, and his confederates<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ang. Sac. p. 704.</NOTE>. He is also stig∣matized with having abused the interest he obtained, by the basest means, in the heart of K. Wil. II. in spiriting up an unhappy dissention between the sovereign
<PB N="143" REF="188"/>and Ansclm archbishop of Canterbury, in which it was insisted, he should deny obedience to Pope Urban the Second, whose election to the Holy See the king would not admit to be legal, or resign his archiepiscopal office; both which being unsubmitted to, he advised the king to deprive him by force<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ang. Sac. p 704.</NOTE>. Symeon's par∣tiality must always be considered, when he says, he was happily accomplished for the episcopal office; he was an adept in ecclesiastical and secular learning, and as∣siduous in his duty. No one exceeded him in propriety of manners. His per∣ception and judgment were so quick, that he instantly formed the justest determi∣nations on events of the greatest moment. He graced the endowments of wisdom with the finest eloquence. He possessed a most retentive memory, and his whole character was so elevated as to claim the attention and favour, not only of his own sovereigns, but also of the king of France and the bishop of Rome. He was a man of strict sobriety and temperance, plain and moderate in his apparel, zealous in the catholic faith, and of singular chastity. Whilst he attended the courts of princes, he was always attentive to, and a strenuous maintainer of the rights and liberties of his monastery and church<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 219.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To those we must add truths unsullied by his errors; that he had a most munifi∣cent heart; his works of piety were truly great; his charity unbounded, and his liberality towards his brethren most exalted. These cast a veil over the shades which are thrown into his political portrait, and leave his memory dear to his suc∣cessors.</P>
<P>After the death of this bishop, the See continued vacant for near four years, during which period the king drew a revenue of 300 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a-year from the coffers of the bishopric; whilst the prior and convent were suffered to enjoy their possessions uninterrupted<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See vacant six months and ten days.—William de S.

<P>In the course of the fourth year from the death of the last bishop, A.

All authors agree, he was a person of mean birth<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ex insimo genere.</HI>—Malmsb. f. 69.</NOTE>; and it is alledged, he pro∣cured his nomination for the price of 1000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> He was first under the protection of Mauritius bishop of London, and was dean of the collegiate church of Twyn∣ham in Hants; but being disappointed in his hopes of obtaining the deanery of London, he got himself introduced at court, where he was soon appointed the king's chaplain. He was endowed with great subtilty of genius, ready wit, and
<PB N="144" REF="189"/>eloquence, by which qualifications he insinuated himself into the good graces of his sovereign, to whom he became a very useful person, in devising the exactions and taxes which he extorted from his people; and, in the end, possesed the highest influence at court. Godwin charges him with much depravity of prin∣ciples: <HI>Honestatem exutilitate mutire.</HI> He was surveyor of the king's homagers; then chief justiciary, which, by the writers of that time, is described as an office superior, in trust and dignity, to treasurer and chancellor; and at last he was ap∣pointed procurator-general; under which employments he conducted himself so oppressively, and with such injustice, that he incurred a general odium<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 233. n. 5.—Hoveden, p. 1, 468. n. 20.—Madox, p. 22.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The iniquitous practice of seizing the temporalities of bishoprics, was first be∣gun by this king, at Flambard's instigation, as Odericus Vitalis says. Before the Norman invasion, the custom in England was, that, upon the death of an abbot, the bishop of the diocese took care of the revenues of such abbot; and, upon the death of a bishop, the archbishop took care of the revenues of such bishop, till the vacancy was filled again. But this custom William Rufus abolished, by the persuasion of our prelate; kept the archbishopric of Canterbury void three years, and put the money arising therefrom into his own coffers.</P>
<P>The continuator of Symeon's history gives us a long relation of the plot that was formed to take away the bishop's life, but proved abortive<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Continuation Sym. Dun. p. 249.—Angl. Sac. p. 705.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Bishop Flambard was consecrated in St Paul's, London, by Thomas archbishop of York, on the 5th day of June, in the year 1099, the same continuator says, without any profession of submission to the archiepiscopal jurisdiction being ex∣acted, which was submitted to by his predecessor: But this is denied by other writers. He had not enjoyed his episcopal function above fifteen months before the king came to his death in the New Forest, as he was hunting the stag, being shot through the heart with an arrow by Tyrrel, a French knight, who was much suspected of design. His character is comprehended in few words. Rapin says, he had all the vices of his father, without his virtues. He was neither religious, chaste, or temperate. He was profuse and profligate; and one instance of his ir∣religion, given by Eadmer, may suffice. Fifty English gentlemen having safely passed the fiery ordeal, on an accusation of <HI>hunting,</HI> he swore by St Luke's face, his usual oath, that he could never believe God was a just judge, since he pro∣tected such offenders.</P>
<P>Malmsbury gives us a melancholy picture of the state of human life in this aera: The minds of men were froward, and inclined to quarrels and warfare; they were overwhelmed in excess and sensuality, from which even the clergy were not exempt. Vanity, lust, and intemperance, reigned every where. Eadmer says, the men appeared so effeminate in their dress and conversation, that they dis∣tinguished their sex in nothing but their daily attempts on female chastity. Even the king's servants, following him in his journies, used to harrass and plunder the country as their wickedness instigated; and many of them were so extravagant in their barbarity, that what they could not eat or drink in their quarters, they either
<PB N="145" REF="190"/>obliged the people to carry to market, and seil for their emolument, or they threw it into the fire. At their departure, they frequently washed their horses heels with the wine left undrunk, or wasted it on the ground. As for out∣rages committed on the persons of the subjects, both men and women, they went to the utmost lengths of licentiousness and cruelty. For these reasons the ap∣proach of the court was dreaded no less than an invasion: when they heard the king was coming, every body quitted their houses, and fled with their effects<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collier, p. 295.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Henry, the king's younger brother, succeeded to the throne. On his acces∣sion he promised to abrogate all oppressive laws made since the coming in of his father; to restore the government to the Saxon system; to abolish unjust and ar∣bitrary taxes, and reinstate the clergy in their privileges. He was made king by the cry of the populace against the judgment of the nobles, who alone, to pre∣vent the horrors of a civil war, Robert his eldest brother being absent, submitted to his being proclaimed. The first step he took in pursuance of his promise was to correct the enormities committed by his officers and servants, and to punish the most notorious with death. Our bishop, the detested minister of the late king, was, by the advice of the great council of the kingdom<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 47.—Sax. Ann.</NOTE>, on the 14th Sep∣tember A. D. 1100, committed close prisoner to the Tower of London.</P>
<P>Those acts were succeeded by the king's abolishing the curfew or couvre-feu<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See page 102 of this work.</NOTE>, and by charter consirming the privileges of the people as established by the Saxons, renouncing the royal prerogatives his father and brother had usurped. By this charter the liberties of the church were restored: The heirs of earls and barons were admitted to their estates without composition or redemption, on paying a re∣lief; and vassals were entitled to the same privilege with their respective lords. He gave liberty to the nobles to marry without the royal licence, provided it was not to the enemies of the state. He appointed that mothers, and nearest relations, should be guardians to minors; and established a general standard for weights and measures. Coiners he ordered to be punished with loss of limb.</P>
<P>The bishop, about the fourth of February, A. D. 1101, effected his escape from prison, and fled into Normandy. The manner of his escape is related by Oderi∣cus Vitalis<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Hist. Eccl. p. 787.</NOTE>, who shortly gives his history to this effect: <Q>That though of mean “extraction, he gained so far on his sovereign's good opinion, by aiding his wic∣ked machinations, that he advanced him to the highest offices of the crown, and, though an illiterate person, he gave him the bishopric of Durham. Af∣ter K. Wil. II. 's death, he was committed prisoner to the Tower of London, under the custody of William de Magnaville; but, by the assistance of his friends, he made his escape. By his sacetious humour and wit, he gained the confidence and esteem of those who had the custody of his person. With the king's allowance of two shillings a-day, he lived in a splendid and convivial manner with those about him. One day having drank deeply, those who at∣tended
<PB N="146" REF="191"/>him being full of wine, he fastened a rope to the pillar in the center of his window, and taking with him his pastoral staff, he descended to his friends, who waited for him at the foot of the Tower, his hands, for want of gloves, being excoriated to the bone by the passing of the cord. Horses being ready for him, he fled with all speed, with a few faithful followers. His steward met him upon the road with his treasure; and, immediately taking shipping, he ar∣rived safe in Normandy, where he met with a cordial reception from Duke Ro∣bert, who immediately put him in possession of the vacant bishopric of Luxen∣burg, ”which he held for three years for his son Thomas, then an infant.</Q> On the bishop's escape, the king seized the lands and revenues of his bishopric, whereupon he severed from thence the bishopric of Hexham, which he gave to Thomas archbishop of York, who, in the year 1114, introduced regular canons there. He also dismembered Carlisle and Tiviotdale from the See; the latter he gave to the See of Glasgow, and the former he erected into a new bishopric, constituting Etherwolf, prior of St Oswald's, the first bishop thereof<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Contin.

<PB N="147" REF="192"/>meat, drink, and cloathing, due to the king, for the sustenance of his officers and servants on the affairs of the crown, was not only granted to the king's auditors attending to pass the treasury accompts and commissioner's, Walter Espee, and Eustace the son of John, but to the king of Scotland in passing to and from the English court, and the archbishop of York in going to and from the bishopric. The cornage is expressly mentioned for the protection of the cattle: So it appears, on the approach of an enemy, on the sounding of a horn, the cattle of the coun∣try were driven into places of security; for which protection the cornage rent was revied. We therein see knights fees, and those of the thanes, and men holding servile tenures, as drengages and smalemannis. Reliefs, sines for trespasses and assaults, and for toll of horses carrying goods. By the same record it appears the borough had suffered by fire, for which seventy shillings were remitted out of the fee of Eustace.</P>
<P>Whilst the bishop was in Normandy, he used his influence with the duke to promote an invasion of England, under an idea that the people, dissatisfied with Henry's usurping the sceptre, would rise to support his lawful right of inheritance to the crown. On the 19th of July 1101, the duke, attended by the bishop, and a powerful army, set out on that expedition; but, by an interposition of the nobles on both sides, and a considerable sum of money given by king Henry to discharge the expences of the duke's equipment, a peace was concluded; wherein, amongst other things, it was stipulated, that all those who had aided the duke, and ap∣peared in his cause, should receive the king's pardon, and be restored to their ho∣nours and estates.</P>
<P>In consequence of this treaty, the bishop regained the See of Durham. After his restoration, he attempted, by rich gifts, and every interest he could use, to ob∣tain
<PB N="148" REF="193"/>the king's favour; to which purpose he laid an oppressive hand on his bishop∣ric, and heavy exactions on the people, to purchase an interest with those about the king's person; but all his endeavours proved inessectual. Neither could he gain restitution of the severed members of his See; but, on the contrary, the king, when importuned on his behalf, in his wrath commanded, that the charters of confirmation of the rights and privileges of the church, granted by his father, should be rescind∣ed and annulled. But this seems not to have been carried into execution; on the contrary, the king, in his charter stiled <HI>De Shiris &amp; Hundredis,</HI> directed to Gerard archbishop, and Ralph bishop, &amp;c. grants, that all the lands and men of St Cuth∣bert, and his monks, shall be acquitted and exempted from the service of shires and hundreds, courts leet, and wapentakes, aids of the sheriff and reve, or constable; and might have their courts as fully and effectually as they had the same in the time of the king's ancestors, with sac and soc, tol and theam, and all other rights and privileges: And therein specifies, that if of any thing (after the bishop's death) they shall be disseised, he commands the same to be restored, and the offenders punished, as breakers of the king's peace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Carta regis Henrici de Shiris &amp; Hundredis.</HI>

<P>The king also, by another charter, specified to be made in the great council, granted to the bishop, Burdon, Carleton, and Acliff, which the people of Nor∣thumberland had falsely claimed against the bishop and St Cuthbert: And also sets forth, that the Northumbrians, French and English, had also falsely claimed a right of hunting in St Cuthbert's forests between Tyne and Tees; and, for the acknowledgement of one penny, to have yearly as much fuel-wood, from the same forests, as one cart could carry; and also, for the consideration of one piece of silver, they should have the largest tree in the woods for ship-building; and also falsely claimed the privilege of the navigation of the river Tyne: All which usurp∣ed customs, and false claims, the bishop protested against before the king and his barons<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hen.

<P>Soon after the bishop came to the See, he made a grant to his nephew Richard, and his heirs, to hold in fee, by homage, and the service of half a knight's fee, (in lieu of all others, except foreign service), of Ravensworth, Blakiston, and Helton, now called Eighton, by metes and bounds therein set forth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Ravensworth, v. ii.</NOTE>; of which grant K. Hen. I. gave his royal confirmation by charter under seal. Roger bishop of Sarum, who was elected to that See 13th April 1102, and lived to 1139, is a witness thereto; which induces a belief, that both these instruments were made after the bishop of Durham's restoration.</P>
<P>About the year 1118, the bishop granted to the prior and monks of Durham, the hermitage of Finchale, which he had given to brother Godric the hermit there, to hold of them for his life<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide Finchale, v. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From the time of his restoration, the bishop remained in quiet possession of his bishopric; and, with great assiduity, applied himself, in various works, to add to its power and magnificence. Notwithstanding he was in possession of Berwick, by virtue of the grant of Edgar king of Scotland, yet, for the better protection of the most northern parts of his territories, and especially to command the ford anciently called Ubbanford, where the Scots made frequent inroads, he built the strong castle of Norham. This fortress was erected on a bold promontory on the banks of Tweed, and, by its present remains, appears to have been a great work, though perhaps little of bishop Flambard's erection is now existing, the castle having received so many shocks, both by warfare and time, and also repeat∣ed additions and repairs. It consists of a lofty donjon tower of great height, a double ballium, guarded by machicolated gates; the wall of the outward ballium garnished with bastions and turrets, and defended on the land side by an outward ditch<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Camden describes Norham castle, in his time, <Q>to be situate on the top of a high steep rock, and “fortified with a trench. The outward wall, of great circuit, was guarded by several turrets, in a canton ”towards the river, in which another wall, much stronger, encircled the keep, or tower, of great height.</Q> This description gives a perfect idea of its figure, after the repairs made by bishop Tu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stall. Towards the river, the ruins now hang upon the very verge of the precipice, part of which, by the washing of the Tweed, has given way, and carried with it the superstructure on that side; which, with the decay incident to the length of time, has occasioned a wide breach in the outward wall, spoken of by Camden. The tur∣rets, as he is pleased to stile them, appear to be no other than demi-bastions, a mode of fortification much practised in England in early times; a perfect model of which, still in good preservation, appears at Hartle∣poole in the county of Durham, of the time of the Edwards, being the palatinate port of the bishopric.
<P>The wall of the castle of Norham, which extended from the water, on the south side, was guarded with a gateway and tower, Laving square turrets on each side, thence ascending the steeps, stretching east∣ward, was also defended by another gateway of superior dimensions, fortified by two heavy round stanking towers, the remains of which are still considerable. This was the chief entrance, and fronts a plain of considerable extent. It was defended by a draw-bridge over a very wide moat, which began here, and was extended round the land-side of the castle, enclosing a spacious area or ballium, with a very strong wall, garnished with demi-bastions at intervals. Within the area of this outward wall are the remains of a cha∣pel, and several other structures. To desend the keep, or main tower, a strong wall encloses a narrow area, or ballium, which is entered by a gateway, guarded on each hand by square towers. The keep is a large heavy square building, vaulted underneath, like most structures of this kind. Part of the vaults, and some of the prisons, remain entire; but all the interior parts of the tower, upward, are laid open, and demo∣lished. The remains of an exploratory turret are seen on one corner of the keep. It may be presumed it was originally uniform, bearing a turret at each corner. The height of the great tower is about 70 feet, containing four stories, or ranges of apartments. The whole building is constructed of red free-stone, of a soft nature, and subject to decay. There is not the least ornament about it, and the whole aspect is gloomy to the greatest degree. It wears the countenance of the times of K. Henry, without any embellish∣ments of the age in which bishop Tunstall lived.</P>
<P>It was a formidable fortress, inaccessible from the Tweed; and, before the use of sire arms, from its pre∣sent remains, appears impregnable, if fully garrisoned and duly provided with stores before a siege. When the outward walls were in repair, and silled with troops, the oilets, and other devices for the garrison's fighting and defence, were properly supplied with experienced archers, and the bastions kept by men of va∣lour, it seems almost incred<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble that this place could ever be taken by assault.—View of Northumber∣land, v. ii. p. 39.</P>
<P>Since the above work was published, much of the outworks have been pulled down. In the center of a thick wall, the skeleton of a man was sound entire, in a recumbent posture.</P></NOTE>. It appears that this castle was erected in 1121.</P>
<PB N="150" REF="195"/>
<P>In the year 1112, this bishop founded the hospital of Kepier, in the neighbour∣hood of Durham, which he dedicated to St Egidius, or Giles. For the mainte∣nance of a priest serving there, and for the poor therein to be maintained, he endowed the same with the vill of Caldecotes, a mill at Milburn, and two sheafs from his demesues in the vills of Newbottle, Houghton, Weremouth, Ryhop, Easington, Sedgesield, Shirburn, Quarrington, Newton, Chester, Washington, Boldon, Cleadon, Whickham and Ryton.</P>
<P>Robert, a captain of king Edgar, who had fought gallantly at the head of his army, when he entered his realm, had presumed to erect a fortress near to the lands of the See, Fordun says in Lodonia; but that is an indefinite expression, and gives no direction to its real situation. It was certainly placed in such ground as to induce the bishop to believe it threatened the safety of his territories; and therefore, whilst Edgar was at the English court, the bishop attacked Robert's habitation, and took him prisoner. On Edgar's remonstrance, he was afterwards set at liberty; but the Scottish king immediately beset Berwick, and again annex∣ed it, with its appendages, to his crown.</P>
<P>On Edgar's death, Alexander the First mounted the throne of Scotland. This monarch granted and confirmed to St Cuthbert, and his monks, all their posses∣sions in Scotland which they held in the time of Edgar. In his general grant, he makes particular mention of the lands between Horndean and Knapdean. He also renewed, by a special charter, the gift of the lands of Swinton; and forbids the prior and monks of Durham to answer in any plea relative to those lands, unless in his presence, or by his command<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smith's Appendix to B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de, N<SUP>o</SUP> 20.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>King Alexander dying in the year 1124, was succeeded by his brother David. This prince attended the court of king Henry in the year 1126, on that sove∣reign's summons, for the recognition of the empress Matilda as his successor. The bishop and prior of Durham were king David's escorts, and were at Rox∣burgh with him in the month of July.</P>
<PB N="151" REF="196"/>
<P>The bishop was particularly solicitous about the works begun by his predeces∣sor, and carried up the walls of the church to the roof. He added to the sacred ornaments divers rich robes and vestments for the holy offices. He enlarged the common-hall of the monastery. The borough, of a strong natural situation, he rendered nobler, and more defensible, by a wall, which he erected from the church to the castle. The ground between the castle and church, which was crouded with houses, he caused to be cleared of all buildings, and reduced into a level plain, for greater cleanness, and to prevent the hazard of fire. He fortified the castle with a moat, and strengthened the banks of the river, over which he built an arched bridge of stone, at the foot of the castle, now called Framwell∣gate bridge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii, p. 388.—Sym. Contin. p. 256.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>About a month preceding his death, he was seized with a lingering disease, which threatening to be mortal, he commanded his attendants to carry him into the church, where, resting on the altar, surrounded by his clergy, and a multi∣tude of the people of his palatinate, he publicly lamented the injuries he had done to his church; particularly the infringements he had made on the ancient liberties, and the lands and customs which he had with-held.

<P>On his decease, the temporalities of the bishopric were committed to the cus∣tody of two barons, John de Amaundeville, and Geofrey d'Escoland, the elder, for the king's use.</P>
<P>The character of this prelate, in the course of the narrative, has been noticed; but it may be agreeable to the reader to add what Lord Lyttleton says of him in his History of Henry II. v. i. p. 61.: <Q>Ralph Flambard, a Norman, from the “dregs of the people, had been advanced by Will. I. to be one of his vassals. He became such a favourite with king William Rufus, that he was set at the head of his administration, and, to the great scandal of the English church, made bishop of Durham. The merit that recommended him to these great promotions, was a forward and enterprizing spirit, an eloquent tongue, a taste for those pleasures his master loved, but, above all, a very fertile invention of ways and means for the raising of money, with a remorseless insensibility to the complaints of the people, and a daring contempt of the resentments of the nobles. He had scarce any learning, and not so much as an external shew of religion; but a more agreeable wit, a more skilful courtier, a more subtle law∣yer, a more magnificent prelate, was not in the kingdom. Under the power of this man, the commons of England, instead of being relieved from their grievances, agreeable to the promises made by the king, were harrassed with more exactions than they had borne, even under the ministry of the bishop of ”Bayeux.</Q> Many times when the king gave orders for levying a certain sum of money amongst his subjects, he would exact double the sum; with which the king being pleased, would merrily laugh and say, <Q>that Ranulph was the only “man for his turn, for he cared not whom his actions displeased, if he could ”but please his master ‡.</Q></P>
<P>In a manuscript in the dean and chapter's library, intituled, The Origin and Succession of the Bishops of Durham, dated 1603, said to be compiled by Mr T. Hall of Conset in the county of Durham, from original records in that library, it is said, the remains of St Cuthbert were inspected during bishop Flambard's episcopacy. These are the author's words: <Q>In this bishopp's time, anno 1104, “being the fifth year of K. Hen. I. after the decease of the holy St Cuthbert
<PB N="153" REF="198"/>418 yeares, upon occasion of the incredulity of certaine prelates, doubting that the corpes of St Cuthbert could not, by so many yeares, continue uncor∣rupted; others affirming and avouching the incorruption thereof: At what time also the new church, founded by bishoppe William, being almost finished, and the said holie corpes was to be transferred into the same, the holie sepul∣chree was, by certaine selected and reverend monks of Durham, about ten in number, opened, and the holie body, with all things about the same, found whole, found, uncorrupted, and flexible; all parts thereof with natural weight, and full substance of flesh and bloode and bones; from whence proceeded a most heavenly fragrant smell; which blessed body was brought forth, and dili∣gently searched and tryed to be uncorrupted and whole as aforesaid, in the presence and view of certaine noblemen and others, both of the clergy and laity, to the number of forty persons and above, such as were thought most worthy and fit to be eye-witnesses of so rare and reverend a spectacle. The holie corpes was also, immediately after the searching thereof, with sundry other holie reliques found therewith, brought forth in procession with great solemnity, before all the assembly of people, and carried round about the said new church, and there reverently placed within the same, in a goodly sepulchree, prepared for that purpose. This was done upon the fourth of September 1104.

<P>After the death of bishop Flambard the See continued vacant for near five years; during which time the monks finished their church at Durham.</P>
<P>The temporalities of the See were in the custody of the two before-mentioned barons, during the time it was vacant: In the year 1133 the king appointed his chancellor GALFRID, surnamed RUFUS, to this bishopric, who was consecrated by archbishop Thurstan at York on the 6th day of August, and he came to his castle at Durham on the tenth<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. iii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>After the bishop had possessed the See upwards of two years, the king departed this life, whose character was blended with a variety of passions. Of his avarice the palatine of Durham had experience: He made virtuous professions at his co∣ronation, but the sweets of ecclesiastical revenues were irresistible. His other propensities did not reach these northern parts, and therefore are passed over in silence. Notwithstanding his great attention to a settlement of the succession of the crown, yet Stephen earl of Bologne, his nephew, supported by the influence of the bishop of Winchester, although he had taken an oath of submission of Ma∣tilda,
<PB N="154" REF="199"/>the king's daughter, aspired to the crown, and, on the 26th day of Decem∣ber 1135, twenty-four days after king Henry's death, was proclaimed king of England. In his coronation oath he swore to fill the vacant bishoprics without delay, and leave the temporalities to the hands of ecclesiastics, and that he would abolish the tax of dane-gelt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sym. Contin. p. 261.—Ang. Sac. p. 709.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>David king of Scotland received the news of Stephen's accession with the great∣est indignation. He had taken an oath on the behalf of the empress Matilda his niece, and was determined to support her rights. He levied an army with all pos∣sible expedition, and, entering Northumberland, possessed himself of the castles of Wark, Alnwick, and Norham. He lay before Bambrough for some time, but was not able to reduce it: Therefore, raising the siege, he proceeded to Newcastle, which was surrendered to him. His further progress was stayed by king Stephen's approach, who by hasty marches, in the beginning of February 1136, reached Durham before it was assailed by the Scottish army. King David had his head-quarters at Newcastle; and whilst the two sovereigns lay within this short distance, peace was concluded between them. By the treaty, David agreed to give up the fortresses he had reduced in Northumberland, on having ceded to him Carlisle and Doncaster<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John and Rich. of Hexham.</NOTE>. Lord Lyttleton<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ld Lyttleton's Hist. of Hen. II. v. i. p. 506.</NOTE>, from Huntingdon's account, speaks of Carlisle; but the local and cotemporary authors above referred to are most to be credited. Those places were to be added to the earldom of Hunting∣don, which was resigned by the king of Scotland to his son Henry, and was then ratified. King David then made a claim, in favour of his son, of the earldom of Northumberland, whose title he deduced from his own marriage with Maud, the eldest daughter of Waltheof, earl of Northumberland, by Judith, the Con∣queror's niece. But the earldom being proved not to pass by inheritance, but by royal gift, king Stephen then only engaged, that if he should thereafter determine to dispose of the earldom to any person, he would cause prince Henry's claim, in right of his mother, to be fairly heard before his judges. This evasive answer did not satisfy the king of Scotland, who, about Easter in the following year, whilst Stephen was absent on his continental affairs, assembled his army, determining to possess himself of Northumberland. Odericus Vitalis says, a plot was in agita∣tion for massacreing all the Normans in England, and to deliver the sceptre to king David, who was the nearest in blood of the Saxon line. But this strange story is not supported by any other author<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Odericus Vitalis, l. xiii. p. 912.—Lyttle∣ton's Hist. Hen. II. v. i. p. 507.</NOTE>. On information of the motion of the Scottish army, the northern earls assembled the forces of their several districts, and made Newcastle the place of general rendezvous. Thurstan archbishop of York had a conference with the king of Scotland and prince Henry at Roxburgh, and made a truce with them for a suspension of hostilities till king Stephen's re∣turn. On his arrival, in the month of December following, king David sent ambassadors to the English court, demanding the furrender of Northumberland, which king Stephen peremptorily denied; on which hostilities immediately com∣menced.</P>

<P>So soon again was this unhappy country exposed to the miseries of war. Such excess of cruelty and depredation were the reciprocal practices of the belligerent powers as disgrace humanity; and are not exceeded by the most barbarous and uncultivated savages yet discovered.</P>
<P>The Scottish king made no delay in marching his troops to the borders. The siege of Wark was his first object; from whence he led his forces into the heart of Northumberland. A great part of this army consisted of raw and undisci∣plined men, a mixed multitude, of barbarous and uncivilized manners, who ra∣vaged and desolated the country with the fiercest cruelty, as far as the Tyne. Richard Hagustal, c. 316, says, This infamous army was made up of Normans, Germans, English, Northumbrians and Cumbrians, men of Tiviotdale and Lo∣donea, of Picts, vulgarly called Norwegians, and Scots. To oppose the invaders king Stephen led forth a powerful armament of horse and foot, and reached Wark about Candlemas 1138. The Scots army, on his approach, retreated from Nor∣thumberland, studiously evading an action; and at the same time attempting to delude the king of England to Roxburgh, and lead him into a snare. But infor∣mation being had of the project, Stephen eluded the design; and, having spoiled the eastern borders, returned to England, in his way taking Bambrough out of the hands of Eustace Fitz-John, whose fidelity he suspected. It is said<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rich. Hag. p. 317. c. 261.—Rich. Hag. p. 317.—&amp;c.</NOTE> the king's speedy return was occasioned by the jealousy he entertained of the sidelity of some of his barons, and that many of his soldiers refused to bear arms in Lent. But a more probable cause was the great scarcity of provisions. The retreat of the English army gave immediate opportunity to the Scots to renew their enterprizes, and they accordingly laid waste the eastern part of Northumberland, which before escaped the fury of the sword. They also proceeded into the eastern part of the county of Durham, and there committed the like depredations and acts of curelty<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lyttl. Hist. Hen. II. p. 187.—John Hag.—Cont. Sym. Dun.</NOTE>. The king of Scotland was advanced to the environs of the city of Durham, when a sedition arising among his troops, and alarms being propagated of the ap∣proach of the English forces, the army retreated, and, in their way, laid siege to the castle of Norham, in which were only nine knights with their retainers, who, in such extensive works, were not able to sustain a long siege; and, be∣ing unrelieved by the bishop, surrendered on terms of life and liberty, and return∣ed to Durham. The Scottish king, possessed of this valuable fortress, the key of that part of the episcopal territory, proposed, in terms to the bishop of Durham, that he should renounce his allegiance to Stephen, and swear fealty to the empress, on which condition he would reinstate him in the possession of the castle of Nor∣ham, the damages the works had sustained in the siege being first repaired. But the bishop refusing to comply with these proposals, the town of Norham was re∣duced to ashes, the fortress dismantled, and the outworks demolished. The Scot∣tish king, restless in his avowed purpose, about the time of harvest, made his pro∣gress into Yorkshire. He left troops to blockade Wark Castle, destroyed the corn and produce of the country in his rout through the neighbourhood of Bambrough;
<PB N="156" REF="201"/>and when he entered the county of Durham, he was joined by a large reinforce∣ment from Galloway, Cumberland, and Carlisle, by which his army was aug∣mented to near the number of 26,000. He was opposed near Northallerton by a much inferior body of men, led by Thurstan, the venerable archbishop, then far advanced in years, with the noble and chief men of the province; and the Scottish army was totally routed with great slaughter. The king and his son, by a hasty flight, escaped to Carlisle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. iii.</NOTE>, not without much hazard to the prince, who was hard pressed by his pursuers. The remains of David's army, in their flight homewards, were every where cut down by the enraged inhabitants, in revenge of the horrid barbarities they committed in their late inroads. Besides these ca∣lamities, the mixed tribes of people which formed the routed army, and had only one great object in view, plunder and rapine, under their ill success, quarrelled, and much bloodshed ensued.</P>
<P>no greater evidence need be brought of the savage practices in the warfare of those days, than appears in the injunction Alberic bishop of Ostia, the legate of pope Innocent II. laid on K. David and his people: <Q>That all the women cap∣tives, “taken in the late incursions, should be set at liberty: That, in future ex∣peditions, they should refrain from the violation of churches, and spare from ”the sword women, infants, and persons in old age.</Q> Dreadful ideas succeed to these reviews: How disgraceful to the age, that these injunctions should be ne∣cessary among Christians!</P>
<P>It appears that the blockade of Wark Castle was still continued, until its sur∣render was consented to by Walter D'Espec, lord thereof; who, desirous of pre∣serving so gallant a garrison, directed that his people should capitulate on any terms the enemy would grant. On the surrender, the fortress was destroyed.</P>
<P>What is before mentioned of the legate, was but a small part of the good works he effected; for, by his intermediation, a peace was concluded between the nations, in which it was stipulated, that the earldom of Northumberland should be immediately granted to prince Henry, the king of England retaining the for∣tresses of Bambrough and Newcastle. The laws and customs of Northumberland were agreed not to be changed, but to remain in full force; and the prince, in right of his earldom, was to have no authority or jurisdiction over the palatinate of Durham and the lands of St Cuthbert, or Hexhamshire. The city of Dur∣ham, in the month of April 1139, was honoured with the presence of the mem∣bers in this convention, when the articles of peace were agitated and agreed up∣on. Maud, Queen of England, with many southern barons, on the part of the crown of England; and prince Henry, with several Scottish barons, on the be∣half of David. From thence the queen of England and prince of Scotland re∣paired to Stephen at Nottingham, where the treaty was ratified<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A degree of power, not noticed before in the history of this See, appears to have taken place during Galfrid's episcopacy. The ingenious and Reverend Mr Mark Noble, who lately published two dissertations on the episcopal coins of Dur∣ham,
<PB N="157" REF="202"/>says, <Q>When Stephen usurped the crown, he was obliged to indulge his “encroaching subjects with many parts of his prerogative, to prevent their re∣volting; the principal of which was, that of coining their own money; a pri∣vilege ”at once disgraceful to himself, and injurious to his kingdom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stow, from Roger de Hoveden, a cotemporary author, p. 147.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The bishops of Durham, neither before the Norman conquest, nor after∣wards, until the reign of K. Stephen, had any mint; nor does it appear that any money whatever was coined in this city till that period<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Durham does not appear as a place of coinage, upon any of the Anglo-Saxon money, in Sir Andrew Fountaine's plates; upon the pennies of K. Canute, lately discovered and published by Mr Gough; upon any of the sovereign type of K. Edward the Confessor, those of K. Harold II.; nor upon the canopy pen∣nies of K. William the Conqueror, found near St Mary-Hill church in London, and given in the 4th volume of the Archaeologia, communicated by the Rev. Dr Grissith; nor in Mr Suelling's View of the Silver Coin∣age of England until the reign of K. Hen. III.</NOTE>. It may therefore be concluded, that the episcopal mint at Durham had its commencement in the reign of that king, but whether by grant or usurpation, is not certain; but probably the former, as the then bishop, a person of great consequence in the state, espoused Stephen's cause, and rendered him many important services<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Galfrid had been chancellor of England in the reign of K. Hen. I. He was consecrated Oct. 6.1128: and, in 1139, he defeated David king of Scotland. He was appointed general by Thurstan archbishop of York, K. Stephen's lieutenant in the north; the primate, by illness, being incapable of commanding the army.

He seems to have occupied his time in spiritual works, and employed his money in edifices for the ornament and defence of his See. He built the present chapter-house for the convent at Durham; and de∣parted this life in his castle there on the 6th day of May 1140, having possessed the See eight years. He was interred in the chapter-house.

<P>In this prelate's time, Coken was given to the church of St Cuthbert by one Aellafus, a priest. In the year 1138, Algar the prior died, and Roger succeeded him.</P>
<P>The series of civil broils which succeeded the peace made with Scotland, though the southern parts of the kingdom were in the utmost distraction, do not appear to have affected Durham and Northumberland. Stephen had imprudence enough to irritate his people, to spread that desolation over the country which ever fol∣lows the cruel footsteps of civil war. The prelates, grown into an insufferable height of insolence, justly provoked his rage. But for him to defy the very power by which he ascended the throne; to oppose those who held in bondage the con∣sciences of the people, and, from that influence, a popularity and power danger∣ous to combat, was an act of the highest imprudence. The strong castles the prelates, as well as barons, had erected, and their attending on the court with a great train of armed followers, shewed the tremendous moment was not calculated for opposition. Had the king, with less intrepidity of mind, suffered the danger∣ous agitation which was then fermenting to subside, he might have corrected the insolence of his subjects at some more favourable season, and secured his autho∣rity without incurring those calamities his rashness produced. He was not en∣dowed with a competent share of wisdom to manage the critical incidents of this crisis. The original error committed in the beginning of his reign, required much prudence to correct; for the castles he permitted his subjects to fortify, now became so many centers of rebellion and rapine, and places of refuge for crimi∣nals of all ranks. One consequence ensued from these struggles in the state, that David king of Scotland attempted to secure the bishopric of Durham for the cause of his niece the empress, which occasioned much distress and affliction in that territory, though it was not involved in the general calamities of the state.</P>
<P>At the time of the late bishop's last sickness, he had with him his chaplain, one William Cumin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Contin. Sym. Dun. p. 263.—Ang. Sac.</NOTE>, who was stiled the king of Scotland's chancellor. Percei∣ving the bishop's dissolution was approaching, he gained the confidence of those about his person, and particularly such as had the custody of the castle, who en∣tered into a confederacy to deliver up the palace and tower to him immediately on the bishop's death. He concealed his project with the greatest assiduity from the prior and archdeacon, and made a journey to the court of Scotland, to con∣sult his sovereign's pleasure, and obtain his assistance in gaining the bishopric. During his absence the bishop departed this life; and, in the night following his death, (it not being possible to keep the corpse otherwise), the bowels were drawn, and the body embalmed. In order that the prelate's exit might not be suspected abroad, when the prior and archdeacon came to the castle, in their usual manner, to pay their visit, they were refused admittance. His death was kept secret until the Friday following, at the end of which time the clamour of the people being great, the rumour of the prelate's death having gone abroad, they prepared for his funeral, as if he was just dead, and he was interred on Sunday. On the Sun∣day following Cumin returned to the castle, armed with the powers of the king
<PB N="159" REF="204"/>of Scotland, who favoured his project; and, by every influence he could exert, he induced the people to submit to his authority; Fordun expressly saying, he took possession of the castle by the command of the empress. He experienced no great difficulty in gaining over several of the most powerful of the barons; notwith∣standing Robert Brus and Bernard Baliol had deserted the Scottish standard be∣fore the battle of Northallerton, on David's refusing to retire on the terms they proposed, in order to save the horrid carnage of the day, and fought under Stephen's banner. They were the first who appeared on behalf of the empress, whose nominee they esteemed Cumin, in order to protect the palatinate. They were joined by Eustace de Baliol and Hugh de Moreville. With every persuasion, argument, or threat, they could use, they endeavoured to influence the prior and archdeacon to elect Cumin to the bishopric; which they steadily refused, as being inconsistent and irregular. All efforts proving vain, it was proposed to consult the legate; and persons were appointed by Cumin's party, who were sworn to act impartially in this business. But the legate gave judgment against such intru∣sion, and pronounced an interdict against Cumin, if he should assume the episco∣pal function without a due election. Notwithstanding these oppositions, Cumin prepared to receive the pastoral staff and ring from the empress on the day of St John the Baptist; and he would have assumed the same accordingly, had not the troubles of the state obliged the empress, with the king of Scotland, and their partizans, previously to leave London. Robert, an archdeacon of Cumin's crea∣tion, with the barons of the bishopric, returned to Durham, bearing the empress's letters, directed to the chapter, requiring their nomination of Cumin. He was with the empress at Winchester, and a party in the miseries of her flight; so that it was near Michaelmas before he returned to Durham, where he found the king of Scotland, who had arrived a short time before him, entertained by the convent: He therefore immediately entered the castle. He found the prior and convent, together with the old archdeacon, still remaining inexorable to every argument. The king of Scotland therefore left Cumin in possession of the castle, as <HI>custos</HI> of the temporalities of the See for the empress; the king pledging himself to the convent, that they should suffer no injury under the authority of Cumin. But Cumin, after the king's departure, not regarding himself as <HI>custos,</HI> but as possess∣ing the authority of bishop, received the homage of all the barons, except Roger de Coniers, and made the burgesses of Durham swear their fealty to him. Not able to bend the determined resolution of the old archdeacon, he persecuted him with the utmost malice, and banished him the county. Without a place of refuge, he fled to York, and Cumin, with insatiable resentment, destroyed his possessions. Ranulf, through innumerable difficulties, at length approached the king's pre∣sence, and laid his injuries before the throne and the legate. Cumin was com∣manded to make restitution; but he despised all the anathemas and sentences which were pronounced against him. Insidious offers were then made to the prior by the abbot of Roxburgh, but proved unavailing. At length, a monk arrived at Durham, who was of the Cistercian order, and straitway was admitted into se∣cret considence by Cumin. He was soon sent abroad to accomplish a project they
<PB N="160" REF="205"/>had concerted between them, and which afterwards came fully to light. A proper time being elapsed, the monk returned, bringing forged letters of the pope, with a counterfeit seal, resembling the apostolical seal, by which the holy See expressed satisfaction at Cumin's election, and commanding Henry bishop of Winchester, the legate, no further to molest him in his episcopal function. Cumin then sent him to David king of Scotland, with equally forged letters, wherein the pope expressed his approbation of the oath the king had taken to the empress Matilda, and that Cumin should hold the bishopric of Durham, by her appointment. It is in no ways surprising a scheme thus executed should deceive the king, who immediately caused the letters to be entered among the records of the kingdom. He presented the monk with a palfrey, and gave him other marks of his royal munificence, and then dismissed him. Richard abbot of Melros, suspicious of the fraud, and zea∣lous for the honour of the holy See, to which these letters appeared to him truly derogatory, set about, with great circumspection, to discover the artfice; and at length brought the monk to confess the whole device, to which he declared he was instigated by Cumin. Innumerable injuries were devised against the convent by the usurper. He had the custody of the city gates, so that he prevented all messages being sent or received by the monks. He frequently prohibited bringing in provisions, and stopped their servants. He had possession of the chapter-seal, and used it as his pleasure dictated. He built a strong castle at Northallerton, which he gave to William his nephew, who espoused the niece of the earl of Albemarle.</P>
<P>In the third year after bishop Galfrid's decease, the messengers, sent to Rome by the prior and convent, returned with letters from the holy See, commanding them within forty days to elect their bishop; and if they could not do it in the church at Durham, on account of Cumin's usurpation, then that the ceremony should be performed in the archiepiscopal church of York, or in some other adja∣cent church. Cumin was not informed of this mandate: He beset the roads with troops, and issued orders that the people of the country should watch the motions of the brotherhood; and if any of them were found abroad, to bring them to him. Notwithstanding all his precautions, some of the convent escaped to York, and there, in the chapel of St Andrew, on the 14th day of March 1143, elected WILLIAM DE ST BARBARA, dean of York, to the See of Durham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Contin. Sym. Dun. p. 273.—Ang. Sac. p. 712.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The bishop elect being absent at a council then held in London, was ignorant of the transaction; but was met on his return at Wintringham on Humber, by the prior, archdeacon, and others his electors, who informed him of the transaction,
<PB N="161" REF="206"/>and, with great reluctance, he submitted to the dignity. At Easter following he was summoned to attend the legate, who examined the nature of his election, the authority on which it was grounded, together with the royal assent thereto, and then performed the ceremony of his consecration at Winchester on the 20th day of June 1143; from whence he returned to York. Cumin had the audacity to send his letters, sealed with the chapter seal, not only to the assembly in which the bi∣shop was elected, to forbid his election, but also to the legate, to prohibit his con∣secration; which being disregarded, he persecuted the members of the convent, and other clergy, with the utmost virulence. He turned his resentment against Roger Coniers, who persisted in denying his homage, and, afraid of violence, fortified himself at Bishopton, where he had his mansion. Cumin gaining intelligence of this procedure, sent thither a great force to dispossess him; but they sailed in their enterprize. The bishop being invited to take possession of his diocese, many flocked to him at Bishopton, where he remained some days, and received the voluntary homage of those who came thither, treating all most graciously who resorted to him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Contin. Sym. Dun. p. 263.</NOTE>. Roger Coniers, and the barons who had attached themselves to the bishop, with an armed force escorted the prelate to Durham, hoping Cumin would relent of his evil deeds, or might be reclaimed by those who were in the bishop's association; but they were totally mistaken; for Cumin absolutely refused to listen to any terms of accommodation; and sending forth an armed force, in an hostile manner, for∣bade their approaching the walls of the city. When the bishop's messengers inform∣ed him of those circumstances, he retired to the church of Egidius at the hospital of Kepyer, founded by bishop Flambard, a little way distant from the walls of the town, where he rested all night. In the morning, Cumin's men forced the gates of the church, and committed various outrages. It would be tedious to pursue all the circumstances of the narrative given by the continuator of Symeon's history, of the acts of violence committed by Cumin's people. The bishop made his retreat to Bishopton; and the usurper's troops were indulged to pursue every excess the wantonness of cruelty, or the avarice of plunder, instigated; so that to follow this author's fine simile, <Q>like the forest, over which the destroying locusts have passed, “where neither flower or verdure is spared, a dreary desolated solitude marked the ”savage progress.</Q> Not content with acts of rapine and waste only, those amongst them most ingenious in wickedness devised horrid tortures for their miserable vic∣tims, superior in infernal invention to those practised in after ages in the island of Borneo; so that, in the very language of this author, <Q>throughout the city inces∣sant “”groans were echoed, and death appeared in a variety of horrid forms.</Q> The bishop about Michaelmas made a nearer approach to Durham, and took possession of a place of strength, erected for his security at Thornley. Whilst the bishop lay there, Eustace Fitz-John and Stephen de Menyll entered into a truce with Cumin, who engaged to cease from further acts of violence until after the octaves of the Epiphany. Cumin certainly agreed to this truce in hopes of some concessions in his favour; dilappointed of which, as soon as the time was almost elapsed, he re∣newed
<PB N="162" REF="207"/>his former cruelties. He seized the person of Humphrey de Thorp in his own house, and carried him away from Durham; and a sum was required for his redemption. After Easter he sent a detachment of troops to ravage the lands of Bernard Baliol, who held a large district on the banks of Tees, now known by the name of Bernard Castle, with its extensive appendages, from whence they brought a rich booty, and some prisoners, which they put to the torture. A truce was made with Cumin, by the intercession of the archbishop of York and bishop of Carlisle, until a messenger could be sent to the holy See for instructions in what manner an accommodation could be effected; during which time Cumin was to hold possession of the castle, with one third of the revenue of the lands between Tyne and Tees; and every thing else within the bishopric was surrender∣ed to the bishop.</P>
<P>New troubles arose, in which Hugh the son of Pinton, the bishop's sewer, was a party. The bishop had passed into Northumberland on his episcopal duty, and, returning to Jarrow, was beset by a number of insurgents led by Cumin's ne∣phew; but, by the valour of those in the bishop's retinue, who gallantly defend∣ed the wall which surrounded the church, he was saved from being made a pri∣soner, which was then attempted. The bishop from this instance thinking himself insecure on the fouth of Tyne, retired privately to Lindisfarne. Hugh surren∣dered the castle of Thornley to Cumin's nephew, on agreement that he should marry his niece. The bishop had placed some hopes of succour in the earl of Northumberland, who had entered into a compact with him for putting him in possession of his bishopric; but Cumin found means to elude the terms of that a∣greement. Cumin's nephew, collecting all his adherents, began to fortify the tower of the church of Merrington, and to defend it with a vallum and outworks; but three of the bishop's barons, Roger Coniers, Geoffrey Escolland, and Bertram de Bulmer, immediately beset the place with the troops they could muster. Some of the people fled at the approach of this force, others betook themselves to the church, which they had surrounded with a vallum and ditch, and, standing upon the tower, annoyed those approaching with their arrows and javelins: But the assailants scaling the windows, whilst others set fire to the edifice, the whole party within were taken prisoners. Cumin's nephew was seized, on the first day he be∣gan this work, with a disorder which terminated in a delirium, in which he expired in great misery. The time of Cumin's truce with the earl of Northumberland being expired, he levied an army, with which he accompanied the bishop to Dur∣ham. Cumin's soldiers in the mean time reduced the hospital and church of St Egidius to ashes, with the whole village belonging thereto; also part of the bo∣rough of Elvet, belonging to the convent, they burnt to the ground; and the earl's soldiers, following their footsteps, destroyed the remainder. The earl then proceeded to Thornley with his troops, where the castle was surrendered to him; but he refused to delvier it up to the bishop, and placed his own people in garrison therein, who began to make depredations in the lands they ought to have protect∣ed, and did much injury in the bishopric. The unhappy prelate finding no faith in the promises of men, in deep affliction for the adversity which seemed to beset
<PB N="163" REF="208"/>him on every hand, retired to Newcastle, whilst the earl marched back into his own country. These various accounts place the Castle of Durham in the light of a very strong fortress, as none of the parties espousing the cause of the bishop at∣tempted to assail it. The king of Scotland, soon after the bishop's arrival there, came to Newcastle to treat with Cumin for the surrender of the Castle of Durham to him. The parties met at Gateshead; but Cumin gave the king no hopes of his compliance; and, returning to Durham, began to treat with Roger Coniers for a compromise.</P>
<P>The bishop had little faith in such a treaty; but, being compelled by extreme necessity, he determined to return to Durham, where Roger Coniers held the city, and Cumin expected him to be received by the convent. But so it is Providence brings forth events, unforeseen by the most exalted wisdom of mankind: When the bishop, accompanied by the archbishop of York, and bishop of Carlisle, en∣tered the city of Durham, on the festival of St Luke, Cumin, in deep contrition of his offences, prostrated himself at the bishop's feet, and voluntarily delivered up the castle, together with the whole territories of the palatinate, without any provision being stipulated in his favour; and took an oath to make good the da∣mages the See had suffered by his intrusion, as far as in his power lay. Thus, after a long exclusion from the See, to which he had been duly elected and conse∣crated, after innumerable injuries and sorrows, through the interposition of Pro∣vidence, the bishop was received in peace to the possession of his bishopric; on which occasion the solemnities were performed with great rejoicing. Some authors have alledged, that, on Cumin's surrender, the bishop granted the honour and Castle of Northallerton, with their appendages, to Richard his nephew.</P>
<P>The bishop was elected in the chapel of St Andrew in York on the 14th day of March 1143, and was consecrated at Winchester by the legate the 20th day of June following: He was excluded from possession one year and four months by Cumin's usurpation, and was not enthroned until the 18th of October 1144, after surrender of the castle, and lands of the palatinate, as before related<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 333, 391.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The bishop had full exercise for that benevolence of soul for which he was re∣markable, in restoring the ruined churches and public buildings of his bishopric, and alleviating the distresses his people suffered in the late civil broils.</P>
<P>The troubles which distracted the state do not seem to have reached this dis∣trict after the bishop was settled in his See; so that his whole time was full of lei∣sure to pursue the works of charity and munisicence. He held the See nine years and five months; and, on the 14th day of November 1152, resigned his spirit to Heaven, and was interred in the chapter-house. He is described as being a person of good stature, with venerable grey locks, remarkable for his hospitality and libera∣lity to the poor, of exemplary manners, true piety, much wisdom, and great per∣spicuity of judgment. He was endowed with profound knowledge in the several branches of literature of that age, and graced it with persuasive eloquence. Ever intent on works of charity and the service of God, the divine countenance he is
<PB N="164" REF="209"/>described to possess inspired every spectator with religious love and veneration. The more he was irritated, the greater moderation and excellence of manners he displayed. He gave no disturbance to the monastery, or to his provincials; and with-held from the church no part of its ornaments or possessions. His memory went down to posterity, distinguished with uniform virtue and propriety <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ang. Sac. p. 718.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In 1149 Roger the prior died, and Laurence succeeded him.</P>
<P>During the late prelate's episcopacy, various struggles were made in vain by the empress Matilda to recover the crown of England; and, after a variety of misfortunes and perils, at last she escaped to Normandy.</P>
<P>Henry, the empress's eldest son, having attained his age of sixteen years, a youth of a lively and enterprising genius, being acknowledged by the powerful party in his mother's interest as heir to the throne of England, was sent over from France by his father Geoffrey Plantagenet, according to the prevailing cus∣tom of that age, to receive the order of knighthood from his grand-uncle the king of Scotland. On the prince's landing in England, he was attended, by all the powerful barons of the north who were in his interest, to Carlisle, where he was met by the Scottish monarch. The ceremony of the prince's receiving the order and badges of knighthood was performed with great pomp<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. iii.</NOTE> on the 22 <ABBR>d</ABBR> day of May, in the year 1149, at Carlisle, in the presence of a numerous assembly of grandees of both nations. On this occasion the prince took an oath, that, when he should ascend the throne of England, he would confirm to David and his heirs the territories which he and his son then held in England, together with Newcastle on Tyne. The prince remained eight months at David's court, improving himself in the art of war, and in the liberal arts and sciences, which were cherished there at that time equally with the most polished state in Europe.</P>

Ang. v. ii. p. 846.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the year 1152, Henry earl of Northumberland departed this life, to the great affliction of his father, and the whole nation of Scotland; who, from his many virtues, had cherished infinite hopes in his succession to the crown. William, the prince's second son, took the earldom of Northumberland.</P>
<P>A multitude of propitious circumstances slowed in upon prince Henry, the son of the empress, which united to increase his influence and power. His father re∣signed to him the duchy of Normandy; and, by his decease in the following year, he came to the inheritance of Anjou, Touraine, and Maine. The next year he gained Guienne and Poicteu, by his marriage with Eleanor, the divorced queen of Louis, surnamed the Young, king of France. The prince's greatness could not be overlooked by the king of England: He grew jealous of his encreasing same, and entertained fears for the succession of the crown, which he wished to leave to his son Eustace. He devised several projects to secure the succession;
<PB N="165" REF="210"/>and, among others, obtained an assembly of the prelates and heads of the clergy, to whom he proposed having his son crowned in his life-time. The assembly ob∣jected to this unprecedented proceeding, especially Theobald archbishop of Can∣terbury; which irritated the king to shut up all the members of the assembly in the house in which they then were, and to surround it with guards, till they should yield to his request. The archbishop effected his escape, and fled into Normandy, which totally overthrew every hope the king had entertained. The proceedings of the king on that occasion, and some severities exercised on many of the em∣press's old adherents, determined the prince to pass over into England, in order to support his party, and assert his rights. In this enterprise he was so successful, that at length the king found himself reduced to the necessity of declaring prince Henry successor to his crown; at which time it was agreed Stephen should reign during his life. This compact took place in the year 1153; and in less than a year the king died, and Henry, with the universal approbation and congratula∣tions of his people, ascended the throne. The civil broils and distresses of Stephen's reign, are testimonies of his folly and incapacity. He was not endowed with qualifications for governing a great and powerful nation, whose ideas of liberty began to revive from the accumulated ruins which were derived from the Norman accession<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">William de Sancta Barbara, bishop;—elected 14th March 1142; consecrated 20th June 1143; private∣ly enthroned 18th August 1143; enthroned duly, 18th October 1144; ob. 14th November 1152.

<P>The See of Durham having become vacant by the death of William de Sancta Barbara, a dissention arose in the monastery, touching precedency and authority, which somewhat impeded the election of a prelate. But, in the month of Fe∣bruary, in the year 1153, the prior and convent unanimously elected thereto HUGH DE PUTEACO, PUSAZ, or DE PUDSEY<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">MSS. Eccl Dunelm.—Angl. Sac. p. 719.</NOTE>, a secular priest, nephew to king Stephen<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">No author has told us the place of his birth, or the name of his father.</NOTE> and the bishop of Winchester, then treasurer of York, and archdeacon of Winchester, a youth about the age of
<PB N="166" REF="211"/>twenty-five years. The electors formed great hopes, that, from his illustrious birth, he would, with much virtue of mind, support the dignity of his See, and maintain its liberties and privileges. The election being made known to the archbishop of York<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Henry Murdac, a pupil of St Bernard, the famous abbot of Clairvaux.</NOTE>, he, with the abbot of Clarevalle, and several other digni∣fied ecclesiastics, highly censured the convent for an act of arrogance and pre∣sumption, in attempting to chuse a bishop without the metropolitan's consent. Whether this was the real objection, as a matter of infringed prerogative, or it was in opposition to the court, there is no determining: But, in the reprehension the convent received, they were told, in the election of a bishop, neither perso∣nal beauty, or any partiality of favour, ought to be admitted as considerations; but the chief motives should be an approved life, and exemplary virtues. It appears that the age of the prelate elect was a chief argument used against him, as being much inferior to what is stipulated in the canon; and his behaviour was thought too secular and unclerical. No wonder, indeed, these particulars should prevail powerfully in the archbishop's mind against Hugh. He was a monk of the Cistercian order, a person of great religious severity, and, in his own life, a strict disciplinarian, never yielding to any personal indulgence, and constantly wearing sackcloth next his skin. He was rigid<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y conscientious; that is, he carried every form and ceremony to the greatest degree of punctilio; and as he maintained the highest dignity of example, so did he in precept. He was austere, distant, and reserved<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stubb's Act. Pont. Ebor. Col. 1721.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When the archbishop found his remonstrances availed not with the convent to induce them to revoke the act of their chapter, he lost all moderation in his re∣sentment, and broke out into the most shameful vehemence, pronouncing an ex∣communication against all the parties concerned therein. The bishop of Win∣chester, who had the king's concurrence, was the only prelate that appeared pub∣licly on the side of the electors<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Under this anathema, the bishop and convent made application to the king, entreating his intercession with the archbishop for a revocation of the sentence; but he remained inflexible to all the arguments of the sovereign, and Eustace his son; protesting he would not remit the same, unless all the parties, with sincere penitence, would submit themselves to the judgment of the church of York. Ap∣plication was then made to archbishop Theobald, the pope's legate in England, who granted them an absolution in the church of Beverley: But, as something was to be done to conciliate the mind of the archbishop of York, they were sen∣tenced first to submit to the penance of the whip, within the precincts of that church. Wharton, from Geoffrey of Coldingham, says, this act did not add any thing to Hugh's merit of consecration; and that the convent, who made this ri∣diculous spectacle to the public, looked upon it as an act of the greatest decorum, despised the reproaches of the vulgar, and esteemed those persecutions as merito∣rious sufferings for the liberties of their church<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 720.</NOTE>. This ceremony was no sooner ended, than the bishop elect, with prior Laurence the archdeacon, and several
<PB N="167" REF="212"/>of the principal people of the diocese, set out for Rome. Geoffrey, in an ironi∣cal and contemptuous stile, relates the circumstances of the journey; and says, <Q>“the reverend troop took the attention of all people as they travelled, who blest ”the incomparable church to which such illustrious personages belonged.</Q> The archbishop of York sent his proxy to Rome, to prevent the success of the tra∣vellers: But pope Eugenius the Third<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was also a pupil of St Bernard's, and an old friend of archbishop Murdac.</NOTE>, who was of the Cistercian order, and with whom their adversary would have had great interest, was lately dead, and Anastacius, or Athanasius, the Fourth, elected in his stead, a total stranger to the archbishop; which propitious event procured them an honourable reception. In∣deed the death of the abbot of Clarevalle, and the archbishop, did not contribute a little to the establishment of our bishop, as all further opposition ceased there. After some little examination, Hugh received his consecration at Rome, on the vigil of St Thomas the Apostle.</P>
<P>As they hastened to return to England, prior Laurence was seized with a mor∣tal disease, and died at a village in France, from whence his remains were some short time afterwards brought to his church at Durham, and interred in the cime∣tery yard with his brethren. The bishop, impatient for his return, hastened for∣ward with such of his attendants as were not wanted to be with the corps of Lau∣rence, and with great joy reached England. On the 2d day of May 1154, he was enthroned at Durham, with universal assent; and, in the same year, Absolon was elected prior<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ang. Sac p. 720.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Geoffrey describes the bishop as being a great dissembler; that his countenance and character were affected; his specious virtues and professions of honour were hypocritical and delusive. He charges him with a base weakness, a cupidity of detraction, from which he possessed an ear open to all the invidious tales of dis∣contented and malicious men; who, to win his favour, and aggrandise them∣selves, repeated to him whatever fell from the prior, or any of the convent, either in secret or in jest: So that his aversion and wrath were in a little time highly pro∣voked against the members of the chapter. The secrets of the convent were un∣folded to him, and his passion for evil communication was gratified with every vexatious tale malevolence could repeat, or cunning pervert, to suit the habit of his mind. The consequence was unhappy; he withdrew from the religious body every degree of confidence; day after day he wore a countenance of greater au∣sterity, and at length totally refrained from all conversation and intercourse with the convent, in which he had formerly shewn himself very happy. At length no∣thing was done with impunity. Many of those minions who served his basest principles, and poisoned his ear with adulation and scandalous reports, were pre∣ferred to offices, in contempt of the prior and convent, and, in several instances, by an usurped authority. Prior Absolon, though educated abroad, is not repre∣sented as a man of great parts or erudition, and, under the contentious spirit of the bishop, suffered many of the privileges of the church to be infringed<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 721.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the latter end of the year in which the bishop returned from Rome, king Henry the Second, on the demise of king Stephen, ascended the throne. His
<PB N="168" REF="213"/>first attention appears to have been placed on those sources from whence the evils of the former reign were chiefly derived; and, in consequence, he caused the castles which were fortified by the prelates and barons, in the time of king Ste∣phen, to be dismantled, and many of them totally destroyed. He did not at that time disturb the fortresses of the See of Durham; but, as an early instance of his favour, granted to the bishop a continuation of the liberties and privileges of his palatinate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The lands and privileges falsely claimed by the men of Northumberland during the life of the former bishop, king Henry II. by a confirmatory charter, grants, <Q>Deo &amp; Sancto Cuthberto &amp; ecclesiae Dunelm. “”&amp; Hugoni epo. &amp; omnibus successoribus suis quietas &amp; liberas &amp; imperpetuum.</Q>

<P>The reduction of the castles was followed by the king's revoking all the grants of crown lands, which were weakly and indiscriminately disposed of by his prede∣cessors. Northumberland and Cumberland came within the class of those grants which he reversed; and, notwithstanding the oath he took at the time he received the honour of knighthood, he insisted on those territories being resigned by the crown of Scotland. King David had been dead some short time, and Malcolm his grandson, then a minor of tender years, on the throne, was under regency. But those territories were not re-assumed, without the king of Scotland having Huntingdon secured to him; for which purpose it was taken from Simon de Liz the Third, descended of the king's mother by her first husband. It was not long before disputes were fermented between the sovereigns, a murmur and discontent arising among the Scots for the loss of so large a tract of territory. Henry or∣dered the fortifications of Wark to be restored, and strengthened with additional works. But the matters of difference cooling between the nations, peace was maintained during the life-time of Malcolm, who falling into a declining state, died at Jedburgh in the year 1165, in the 25th year of his age, and 13th of his reign. He was succeeded by his brother William, surnamed the Lyon. He had imbibed the most inveterate hatred against the English during the last year of his brother's life, for the injury he conceived his country sustained by taking away Northumberland. From the time of that event there was no settled peace subsisting between the nations; for though open hostilities were suspended by re∣peated truces, yet frequent inroads and depredations were reciprocally committed on the borders. King William made several demands of restitution of Northum∣berland, to which Henry evaded giving any definitive answer; amusing him with distant promises of referring the matter to his council, when he was at leisure from the broils he was involved in by Becket archbishop of Canterbury, the French king, and his own turbulent barons. To these succeeded domestic troubles of a very serious nature. Prince Henry, the king's eldest son, in imitation of a usage
<PB N="169" REF="214"/>long held in France, had been solemnly crowned, it is alledged, with a view of strengthening the king's family against the consequences of a papal excommuni∣cation and interdict, with which this kingdom was much threatened; a bugbear in those days tremendous to the greatest monarchs. The prince had espoused Margaret, daughter of the king of France, and with her passed over to Normandy, and thence to the French court, where the wild and unbounded ambition of the giddy youth was wickedly cherished, and stimulated to break forth into open ex∣cesses. He was induced as much by the instigation of his mother, as his own de∣sire of greatness, to set up a claim to his father's diadem; and presumed to avow an intention of depriving him of the throne of England. Under a promise of ceding Northumberland and Cumberland, he engaged the king of Scotland in his enterprise. In consequence of this confederacy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ford. l. viii c 21.—Chr Melros, &amp;c.</NOTE>, the Scottish king led a great army into England, in the year 1173, beginning his campaign by the siege of Wark. To form an idea of the people who committed the most cruel depre∣dations in this expedition, take Ralph de Diceto's description. This army, he says, <Q>consisted of an infinite multitude of men of Galloway, who were remark∣ably “ferocious and daring; were swift of foot by daily exercise, being also na∣ked: They were dextrous at throwing the lance or javelin, which they could cast to a vast distance with great exactness; and, for closer fighting, were arm∣ed ”with a short poniard.</Q> The Castle of Wark not being easily reduced, they raised the siege, and went before Carlisle, where they were equally unsuccessful. From thence they advanced into Yorkshire, having a free passage allowed them through the palatinate of Durham by the bishop. Richard de Lucy, who then held the office of justiciary, and Humphrey Bohun, constable of England, advan∣ced with an army to oppose the Scots, who retired at their approach; and soon after a truce was entered into by the mediation of the bishop of Durham, to con∣tinue to the end of the approaching festival of Easter; for which Northumber∣land paid to Scotland 300 marks<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">—Hoveden, Lel. Col. v. iii.</NOTE>. In the beginning of April the king of Scot∣land again entered Northumberland with an army of 80,000 men. A detachment ravaged Cumberland, and took most of the castles in that district. Warkworth and Harbottle Castles in Northumberland were reduced; but at Pruddoe, on the south banks of Tyne, a castle of Odonel de Umfreville, the Scots met with a brave resistance, which staid their progress so long, that the northern English ba∣rons in the king's interest levied a great army; on whose approach the Scots re∣treated towards Alnwick. Whilst the king of Scotland lay in that station, he suf∣fered his army to be deranged, broken into divisions, and detached to pillage the country; whilst, unsuspicious of danger, the king retained but a small party near him for his guard. Thus circumstanced, the king was surprized by 400 horsemen sent from Newcastle<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Scala Chron lib ii. Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 532.</NOTE>, under the command of Robert de Stute∣ville lord of Knares∣brough, Ranulph de Glanville, and Bernard Baliol<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Gul. Nubr. lib. ii. c. 33. He names Stute∣ville, Glanville, Baliol, and Gul. de Vesey.</NOTE>. Walter de Coventree adds to these, Gul. de Streteville, Will. de Vesey, Ra. de Tilley constable, of the family of the archbishop of York, and Odonel de Umfreville. A thick fog concealed
<PB N="170" REF="215"/>the approach of this gallant troop, but yet left them doubtful of the danger which might be at hand. Under this circumstance, it was the general opinion of the party, that it would be most prudent to desist from the enterprise. But Baliol, of an in∣trepid spirit, encouraged them to advance; the fog soon after dissipating, they found themselves in sight of the Castle of Alnwick, and discovered the king, with a guard of about sixty horse, taking the air, unsuspicious of danger. The Scots did not take notice of their approach, presuming they were a party of their own troops returning from pillaging the country. When they were advanced so near as to render further deception impracticable, they displayed the English standard; on which the king of Scotland, disdaining to turn his back on danger, with great bravery spurred on his troop, and charged the English. His horse was killed un∣der him, his party overpowered, and he, being made prisoner, was hurried away by his conquerors, who brought him to Newcastle that night. Benedict of Peter∣borough, says, on the day the king of Scotland was surprised, earl Duncan, with a division of the Scottish army, entered Warkworth, which they reduced to ashes, putting the inhabitants to the sword, without distinction of age or sex; that they forced open the church of St Laurence, and the parsonage house, where they butchered about 100 men, besides women and children. Gul. Nubr. speaking of the king of Scotland's negligent situation, has those words; <HI>suo quippe tam vas∣to, quamvis minus conglobato, circumvallatus exercitu, conclusam illam paucitatem facile absorbendam esse a circumfusa multitudine, nec ambigere dignabatur</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gul. Nubr. lib. ii. c. 33. p. 192. oct. ed.</NOTE>. From New∣castle they removed their royal captive to Richmond Castle, a place of greater strength and security, there to be detained till the king's pleasure should be known. This event threw the whole Scottish army into the utmost confusion. Making a retreat with all expedition to their respective districts, like savages, without re∣straint, they fell upon the inhabitants of the borders with renewed cruelty, and cut off all their English fellow subjects in their passage<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. lib. ii. c. 34. p. 193.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>It is observable, that no one within the earldom or wapentake of Sadberge is named in this return of knights; the most powerful in that liberty being Baliol, Brus, and Tailbois. This is another convincing proof, that the royal grants to the See of Durham did not anciently extend between Tyne and Tees.</P>
<P>In 1171 Becket archbishop of Canterbury was assassinated; the king, to purge himself from the charge of being an abettor, submitted to the most degrading penance. Notwithstanding the intolerable arrogance and pride of this prelate, his miserable exit, together with the time, place, and circumstances of the murder, caused his errors to be forgotten; and his memory, afterwards, was even held in veneration. The same day the king left Canterbury, the king of Scot∣land was made his prisoner. On that very day the armament from Flanders, prepared to invade this kingdom, met with a storm; the fleet was scat∣tered, and many of the vessels wrecked. These were the rewards which,
<PB N="173" REF="218"/>according to the superstition of the age, Divine Wisdom was supposed to dispense as marks of approbation of the most abject degradations of royalty. The king lost not a moment to pursue the correction of his dissident barons; and, in less than a month, compelled them to surrender their castles and persons. Whilst he remained at Northampton, his royal prisoner was brought before him, like a common malefactor or traitor, with his feet bound under the belly of the horse on which he rode. Such were the manners of the times. The bishop of Durham also came before the king at Northampton, to make his submission. He was the only prelate in the realm who had given cause to suspect his loyalty. He had, in the former year, permitted the Scottish army to march through his territories without opposition; and lately had sent for a body of Flemings, consisting of 40 knights and 500 foot soldiers, to come over into England, under the command of his nephew Hugh de Bar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i p. 128.</NOTE>. They landed at Hartlepool on the very day the king of Scotland was made prisoner; the news of which event induced the bishop immediately to send back the foot; but he retained the knights, and committed the care of his Castle of Northallerton to his nephew, with that force for its de∣fence. It appears that the bishop, soon after coming to the See, rebuilt, or other∣wise greatly enlarged the works of Northallerton Castle, which, at that period, was one of his chief places of strength. The bishop, under the present situation of state affairs, was glad to accommodate his offences with the king, upon any terms he could obtain; to which end he paid a large sum of money into the royal coffers, and surrendered his Castles of Durham, Northallerton, and Norham; which latter place he had rendered very strong, by reforming or rebuilding the Donjon tower, and strengthening the outworks.</P>
<P>The king, with the utmost expedition, hastened into Normandy, where victory and success every where attended his steps. He made peace on his own terms with the king of France, and received the submission of his rebellious sons, whom he treated with a clemency and heroic generosity their offences did not merit. Whilst at Fallaise he concluded a treaty with the king of Scotland, whom he carried with him, first imprisoning him at Caen, and afterwards removing him to Fallaise; at which latter place he liberated him on very humiliating terms to the Scottish nation; not less than doing homage, and swearing fealty for his kingdom, and other submis∣sions too tedious to relate. Soon afterwards the keepers of some of our northern fortresses were removed. Norham, which was in the keeping of Roger de Coniers, was committed to William de Neville; and Geoffrey de Neville was made gover∣nor of Berwick<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rym. tom. ii. p. 564.</NOTE>. The bishop, to conciliate the mind of the king, who still wore a frown on his former dissidence, presented him with a free gift of 2000 marks, to induce him to spare his castles from destruction, and to purchase, for his son Henry, the royal manor of Witton. The manor was obtained, but he could not rescue his Castle of Northallerton, which the king ordered to be ra∣zed to its foundation<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i. p. 133.—Hoved.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Not long after, at an assembly of the military tenants at Winchester, summoned to concert the king's intended passage into Normandy, it was advised by his coun∣cil,
<PB N="174" REF="219"/>that the Castles of Durham and Norham should not be surrendered up to the bishop, whose fidelity, during the king's absence, was much suspected<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. p. 134.—Ang.

It was also a part of that oath, that wherever they found robbers, or other criminals, in the bishop's territories, they would bring them to justice<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Carta regis Henrici Secundi de missione justitia regis in terram S.

<P>A perfect harmony subsisted between England and Scotland during the remain∣ing p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt of K. Henry's reign. Our bishop, with Ranulf de Glanville, mediating a settlement of the affairs of Galloway, in which they were sureties for the safe conduct of Roland, who claimed that province, to and from the presence of the two sovereigns of England and Scotland, met at Carlisle on that matter.</P>
<P>In 1188, the king of England entered into a compact with the French king to go upon a crusade; and, in provision for that expedition, a tax of one tenth was imposed upon his subjects, both clergy and laity. The bishop of Durham was one of the commissioners appointed to collect it in Scotland. On this embassy the English commissioners were met at Brigham in Northumberland by the king of Scotland, and a great assembly of bishops, earls, barons, and inferior vassals. Though the king expressed his willingness to suffer the tax to be levied, the assem∣bly vehemently protested against it, and neither the soothings or threats of the English ambassadors could shake their determination.</P>
<P>Whilst the king of England was earnestly preparing for this expedition, he was obliged to pass over into Normandy, to defend his dominions there against the at∣tacks of France, united with the rebel forces of his eldest son Richard. His for∣mer prosperity forsook him: His embarrassments were multiplied. Such truces as he could obtain, only served to strengthen his enemies; and at length his affairs became so critical, that he was obliged to sue for peace, on terms to be dictated by the king of France. In the midst of these distresses, the king's youngest and favourite son John, went over to his adversaries. The king's mind and consti∣tution, weakened by such severe exercise, could not support this last shock; and, two days after signing the articles of peace with the king of France, he departed this life. His disappointments threw him into so violent a rage, that he cursed the day of his son John's birth, and uttered the most horrid imprecations on his other sons, which the bishops then present could never induce him to revoke. As his dissolu∣tion drew near, he ordered his attendants to carry him into the church of Chi∣non,
<PB N="175" REF="220"/>where he then lay; and making some short prayers, in a voice so low as not to be heard by the bystanders, but by his gestures construed to be penitential, he died there. It is said his domestics forsock him after stripping his corpse, and leaving it naked before the altar. He was interred at Fonteveravd<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rapin, p. 243.—Brompt. p. 1151.—Hoveden.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thus expired one of the greatest monarchs of the age. He possessed the quick∣est apprehension and judgment; had a valiant soul, and blended prudence, policy, and generosity, with courage. Blest with a studious mind, he enriched it with much erudition. Such illustrious characters were yet stained by ambition, insatiable <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve of fame, and an inordinate passion for the fair sex. Rapin, from the authority of Brompton<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Brompt. p. 1044, 11<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0, 11<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1.</NOTE>, charges him with attempting the chastity of all he met, not except∣ing the princess designed for his son's spouse. In the beginning of his reign he was esteemed the greatest prince in Europe; but his felicity was sullied by the intolerable arrogance of Becket, and brought to destruction by the crimes of his family. By his accession, this kingdom became superior to France; and he added greatly to its powers and honours by the conquest of Ireland. He died on the 6th day of July 1189, and in the 57th year of his age, having reigned upwards of 34 years.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his then eldest son, Richard, surnamed <HI>Cocur de Lion;</HI> who, soon after his coronation, prepared for a crusade; for which purpose he had assumed the cross in his father's life-time. Not content with the money his father laid up for an expedition of the same kind, he made every effort to amass much treasure, and did not hesitate to stoop to measures disgraceful to his crown. He offered to sale his castles, demesne lands, and towns; and released the king of Scotland and his heirs, with the kingdom of Scotland, from all subjection to the crown of England, for 10,000 marks of silver; at the same time resigning Rox∣burgh and Berwick for ever.</P>
<P>Whilst the king was making his preparations, the bishop of Durham, enfla∣med with the zeal of the times, after the example of many other prelates and ab∣bots, also took upon him the vow and cross, and, on his part, levied money for the expedition<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Angl. Sacra, p. 723.</NOTE>. He built himself a beautiful galley for his passage, together with several other ships to transport his retainers, retinue, and attendants. That he might exceed all the other prelates and leaders in magnificence, he also prepared for his journey, furniture, and necessary implements for his kitchen, to∣gether with other household vessels, all of silver. He made himself a throne, or chair of state, of admirable workmanship, in silver, highly ornamented. It is agreed by all historians, that, to raise supplies for this pursuit, he distressed his people with grievous exactions and taxes. The king did not remain a stranger to his splendid preparations; neither could the money he had amassed, or his re∣pentance of the hasty vow he had made, be kept secret. The king laid a scheme to avail himself of this knowledge. More desirous of the bishop's gold than his per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onal services, he most graciously proposed to dispense with his vow, in order that
<PB N="176" REF="221"/>he might remain at home, and take care of the realm, as one of the regents, in his absence. His vanity was instantly kindled to a blaze, and his eyes were blinded by the prospect of power, from discernment of the king's original pur∣pose in the application; who immediately, on the bishop's accession to his proposal, applied to borrow the money the prelate had collected, as now being useless to him. This brought on a bargain for the purchase of the earl∣dom, wapentake, and manor of Sadberge, to be annexed to the See of Durham for ever, together with the earldom of Northumberland for life, for which the prelate was to pay 11,000. <ABBR>l.</ABBR><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Geof. de Cold — Ang. Sac. p. 724.</NOTE>. The young king, when he girt the bishop with the military sword, and conferred those earldoms upon him, could not forbear his de∣rision of the inconsistent character; and, turning to his nobles, said, <Q>You see “”what power I possess; I have made a young earl of an old bishop<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gul. Nubr.</NOTE>.</Q> From this period the bishop of Durham, in right of Sadberge, assumed the dignity of a tem∣poral earl, united with the episcopal function. For it was not only a creation of the title of earl of Northumberland that the bishop was then honoured with, but with the local earldom of Sadberge too, which was granted in perpetuity to the See, whilst Northumberland was only a temporary honour, extinguishable on the bishop's death. In consequence of this grant, the bishop, and his successors, graced the mitre of Durham with the earl's coronet, and displayed the sword with the pastoral staff<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Richardus rex vendidit manerium de Sadberg Hugoni episcopo, Dunelmensi pro 600 marcis, vendidit rex etiam Hugoni com<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tatum Northumbriae pro tempore vitae suae.—<HI>Hovea.—Lel. Col. v. i. p.</HI> 290.</NOTE>. These new dignities were not sufficient to satisfy the prelate's ambition: He pressed the king for performance of the terms originally proposed, that he might have a more specious and colourable excuse for not performing his vow, and desired the king to alledge, that he could not be spared out of the kingdom whilst he was on his intended expedition; and, for 1000 marks addition∣al gift, induced the king to appoint him chief justiciary of all England, and go∣vernor of the castle of Windsor, with the adjoining forest. The pope's dispensa∣tion was obtained, it is said, by a similar influence. Before the king's departure, England was divided into two districts. Longchamp bishop of Ely, chancellor of England, and legate from the See of Rome, was appointed regent over the sou∣thern department, and the bishop of Durham over the district north of Humber.</P>
<P>The bishop's authority and magnificence was now at its height. He not only possessed the official dignity of earl of Northumberland, but had obtained a local and perpetual earldom annexed to the See, and an additional district of great extent, by means of which he now held the whole territory between the rivers Tyne and Tees. Sadberge was granted in the year 1189, under the description of the ma∣nor of Sadberge, with the wapentake thereto belonging; together with the ser∣vice of Peter de Carow of one knight's fee for Seaton and Overton; Thomas de Amundeville, one knight's fee, for Coatham and Treiford; Godfrid Baad, two parts of a knight's fee, for Middleton and Hartburn; with sochâ and sachâ, toll and theem, and infangtheof; with all other liberties and free customs, and pleas of the crown, as the king held the same in his own hands, and as the bishop held and enjoyed his other lands and knights fees within the bishopric<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Richardus, &amp;c.

<P>The king soon after passed into Normandy to join the king of France, the bishop attending him so far on his journey. On the bishop's return, Longchamp, in con∣sideration of his superior dignities, refused to admit him as his compeer in govern∣ment; and, with artful pretences, decoying him to London, got his commission into his hands, under pretence of examining how far his delegated authority ex∣tended: And then alledging their contrariety of sentiments and disposition would perpetually embroil the state, and impede the steps of government, he denied him a share in the administration. An open rupture ensuing, the bishop of Durham was committed prisoner to the tower, on an allegation of his holding principles incompatible with the liberty of the people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the 8th year of K.

He had not liberty to send dispatches to the king, and an appeal to his adversary was useless. The only terms he could obtain his release upon were, the surrender of the Castle of Windsor, with its depend∣encies, together with Newcastle, and the earldoms of Northumberland and Sad∣berge; and to give his son Henry de Pudsey, and one of his chief barons, Gilbert de le' Leya, for hostages to ensure his peaceable behaviour. Under all these cir∣cumstances his imprisonment was only enlarged to the territories of Hoveden, from whence he was not to depart, under pain of being apprehended as a traitor<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Scala Chron.—Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 534.</NOTE>. Nothing could be more severe or humiliating to a person possessing so arrogant a soul. The bishop took the first opportunity of writing letters of complaint to his sovereign; to which he received in return the royal mandate to liberate him, and put him in immediate possession of Sadberge: But imprudently sending the in∣strument
<PB N="178" REF="223"/>to Longchamp, he arrested it, returning for answer, <Q>He had “a more certain knowledge of the king's will than could be conveyed to ”him by written orders.</Q> Hoveden<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hoved. p. 351.</NOTE> and Neubrigensis say, that, upon the death of Roger archbishop of York, the king ordered his officers to enquire in whose hands his effects lay, and to make seizure thereof. They having information that the bishop of Durham had received 500 marks of the archbishop's money, made a demand, which the bishop answered by alledging he had disposed of it to the blind, lame, and indigent, according to the archbishop's order; which reply so enraged the king, that he commanded his Castle of Durham to be seized, and other severities exercised upon him.</P>
<P>Longchamp's administration was so full of oppression, that he was deposed by the great men, who could no longer endure his ill conduct; and, soon after, the king, on repeated calls to return to his dominions, left Palestine, where he purchased immortal honours by his puissant deeds. Attempting to pass through Germany, on his return, with a small retinue, he fell into the hands of Leopold duke of Austria, whom he had affronted at the siege of Ptolemais, and by him was delivered over to his adversary, the emperor Hen. VI. A large sum of money was raised for his ransom, of which our bishop furnished the sum of 2000 lb. of silver<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ang. Sac. p. 724.</NOTE>. On the king's arrival in England, the bishop discovered a coolness in his car∣riage he did not expect, and conceiving the earldom of Northumberland was the object of his attention, he voluntarily resigned it into the king's hands, who appointed Hugh Bardolf to the custody thereof<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i. p. 292.</NOTE>. But this was not the matter which occasioned the king's frown. The bishop had spies upon his conduct, who lessened his interest with the sovereign by their whispers; for it got to the king's ear, that, under pretence of raising a supply towards redeeming him from captivity, he had extorted immense sums from his vassals, a small portion of which he had remitted; on which account, the king devised repeated occasions to impose various fines and penalties upon him, and this he did with greater severity, as the bishop did not even endeavour to conceal his riches, but proceeded in the building of Dar∣lington church, and other religious works. Soon after the king went over into Normandy, in the year 1194, William king of Scotland was in treaty with him for the restitution of Northumberland, for a sum of money; to frustrate which, and outbid William, the bishop imprudently made an offer to him of 2000 marks<NOTE N="|" PLACE="foot">Hoveden.</NOTE>. for the redemption and recovery of his former earldom and honours. From the authority of Geoffrey of Coldingham it appears, that Sadberge was a part now sought to be restored. The proposal was accepted, and the king ordered the mo∣ney forthwith to be sent to him. But the bishop, too wily to be entrapped by so weak an artifice, humbly besought the king, by letters, to restore him to the earl∣doms, and thereupon appoint a proper person to receive the stipulated sum; or, otherwise, petitioned him graciously to permit him to apply his money in religious works, for the benefit of his bishopric. The king, as full of subtlety as his vas∣sal, dissembled with him, and wrote letters penned in such delusive language, that
<PB N="179" REF="224"/>the bishop was induced to take a journey to London, with his money, on a pro∣mise not only of restitution, but of additional honours in the state. He set out on this business about Shrove-tide, and, resting at Crake, is said there to have brought on his death, by eating to excess at supper of rich and surfeiting viands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ang.

Though he was taken ill there, he moved forward to Doncaster; where, finding his disease increasing, and no longer able to bear the motion of his horse, he re∣turned by water to Hoveden. He had attained the age of seventy years, and ye<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> testified the greatest reluctance to dying. When his physicians told him the immi∣nent danger he was in, he was not inclined to trust them, and grasped hard at the remnant of life. He cherished the hopes of recovery by a mistaken superstition: for Godric, the holy hermit of Finchale, having assured him he should be blind ten years before his death, he considered the prophecy literally, and did not conceive it pointed out to him the blindness which pride and ambition should involve him in; and thence, whilst his eyes continued good, having faith in the hermit's words, he disdained to think of settling his affairs, and preparing for death. But the ty∣rant's attacks were no longer to be diverted: The bishop's disease and bodily pain increased; and, by earnest intreaties of his friends, he submitted to have his last testament prepared, in which he endeavoured to make every atonement he was able for his excesses in power. He made restitution to those in his palatinate whom he had disseized of their estates and possessions, with ample recompence for the injury. He restored to the monks of Durham the lands and liberties which he had illegally dispossessed them of; and, for recompence, added thereto the vill of Newton, which he purchased, and confirmed to them by charter. He bequeathed 2000 marks to the king, which was promised on restitution of Sadberge; and, on the third of March 1194, he departed this life at Hoveden, and was interred, agreeable to his desire, in the chapter-house at Durham, with his predecessors<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The first beginning of institutions to benefices was in a national synod held at Westminster, anno 1124; for patrons did originally fill all churches by collation and livery, till this power was taken from them by canons.—Selden's Hist. of Tithes, cap. 6.

<P>In consequence of his political character, and engagements in state affairs, it was necessary to refer to this period, a view of his particular actions, religious
<PB N="180" REF="225"/>works, and acts of benevolence, within his palatinate. Prior Absolon was suc∣ceeded by prior Thomas in the year 1162, who engaging with the bishop in a dis∣pute about the church of Allerton, a violent contention arose, in which the monks not supporting their prior as they ought to have done in protection of the rights of their church, was deposed by the bishop in the year 1163, and retired to the island of Farne, where he lived the life of a recluse. He was succeeded by Germanus, who enjoyed the office to his death, which happened in the year 1188. Hoveden says, in this year the bishop made restitution to the convent of 200 marks and upwards, which, from unjust lucre, he had retained in his hands two years. Bertram succeeded as prior, and survived the bishop. He revived the custom of taking the abbot's seat in the chapter and choir, which his predecessor had disused. Notwithstanding the dissentions which subsisted at first between the bishop and con∣vent, it appears they afterwards were reconciled, and on terms of amity, the bi∣shop making several valuable donations to the church.</P>

<P>Approving the pious works of his predecessors, in the buildings and ornaments of the church, he determined to pursue their example; and accordingly set about to make an addition to the episcopal church at the east end thereof, and imported, from abroad, marble pillars and bases for the same: But, through some accidents which retarded his progress, he conceived his purpose was not acceptable to Hea∣ven; so that he desisted from that project, and began to build the gallilee at the west end, for the reception of women at the holy offices of religion, who were

He gave to the church a crucifix and chalice of pure gold<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. He built, and amply endowed with lands and tythes, the hospital of Sherburn, for the re∣ception of sixty-five lepers, (the leprosy, though now totally eradicated, being a dreadful evil in those days); together with a master or custos, and chaplains to perform divine service<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid.—See Sherburn.</NOTE>. He appropriated to this hospital the churches of Kel∣low, Sockburn, Grindon, Ebchester, and Bishopton.

<P>This was no unusual practice of the prelates in those days. Thus archbishop Courtney, to defray the expences of founding Maidstore College in Rent, had recourse to the arts of his predecessors, who were wont to make others pay for the charities of which they assumed the merit, and accordingly procured a li∣cence from the pope, to gather four pence in the pound out of all ecclesiastical preferments within this pro∣vince.— Randal's MSS.</P></NOTE>. He built the bridge at Durham called Elvet-bridge; rebuilt the borough of Elvet, which was reduced to ashes during Cumin's usurpation; and restored the same, with its ancient privi∣leges, to the convent, to which it formerly belonged. He built the city wall from the North Gate, now called the Gaol Gate, to the South, or Water Gate, which ran along the brink of the hill, above the river, opposite to Elvet, part of which is still remaining, as will be remarked in the View of Durham<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 333.—Ang. Sac. p 723.</NOTE>. He rebuilt part of the Castle of Durham, which, during his episcopacy, suffered by fire<NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">Ang. Sac. p. 723.</NOTE>. It appears that part of the borough was damaged by this conflagration, as a re∣mission was made by government of part of the levies, in consideration thereof. About the year 1174, he strengthened the Castle of Allerton, which the king af∣terwards commanded to be demolished; on which occasion Henry, the bishop's son, and the garrison, with some difficulty obtained permission to return to France. He built and endowed an hospital dedicated to St James, about a mile to the east of Northallerton; built various houses upon his manors, and improved and repaired others. About the year 1164, he erected a spacious mansion-house at Darlington, now called the Old Hall; and also rebuilt the church there, and
<PB N="182" REF="227"/>instituted a religious society, consisting of a dean and four secular canons. It was said, that, on the dismission of the seculars from the episcopal church at Durham, part of them were settled at Darlington; so that the original foundation ought not to be attributed to this bishop: But, from his munificence, the church, an elegant edifice for the age in which it was built, the regulation of the ecclesiastics there, and foundation of the college, are derived<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 333.</NOTE>. He maintained various troublesome and expensive law-suits, in support of the liberties and privileges of the See, in which, by his assiduity, riches, and quickness of judgment, he was always successful. Besides those before mentioned, he made several donations. About the year 1169, he granted to the burgesses of the borough of Gateshead, liberty of his forest there, under stipulated acknowledgments, for their cattle and horses, &amp;c. grazing therein, and for fishing there, subject to certain restrictions; and granted similar liberties to the same burgesses for their burgages, as those of Newcastle had in right of burgages within that borough; with the pri∣vilege for themselves and cattle to pass through the liberties of the palatinate, without any toll or other exaction<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide Gateshead, 2d vol. under which head this charter is quoted.</NOTE>. In the year 1180, he confirmed to the nuns of Newcastle, lands in the borough of Durham, granted by one Toce, and Alanus his brother; reserving all services appertaining to the borough of Durham. For the faithful services of his dependents, he made a grant of the vills of Corn∣sey and Hedley, with lands at Escomb<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vide Cornsey, 2d vol. under which head the grants are quoted.</NOTE>. He caused a general survey to be made of all the ancient demesne lands and possessions of his bishopric, in the form and manner of Doomsday-book, which is recorded in a small folio, consisting of 24 pages, wrote in a bad hand, called Boldon Buke, now remaining in the office of the bishop's auditor in Durham. It contains inquisitions, or verdicts, of all the seve∣ral tenures of lands, services, and customs; all the tenants names, of every de∣gree; how much each of them held at that time, and what rents were reserved for the same.

<P>The bishop, whilst treasurer of York, had three natural children, all sons; but, after he became a bishop, historians have not attributed such errors to his character. His eldest son Henry was begotten of a lady of noble extraction, and, betaking himself to arms, was a man of valour. The second, named Burchard,
<PB N="183" REF="228"/>was made treasurer of York by K. Rich. I. The bishop (notwithstanding this son's incapacity under the canons, and his immoral life) gave him the archdeacon∣ry of Durham, and rectory of Auckland, and loaded him with many other ec∣clesiastical benefices and promotions to a great value, which he enjoyed but a very short time after the prelate's death, departing this life on the 6th day of December 1196, having bequeathed all his effects to the establishment of the cell of Finchale. The third, named Hugh, the father's favourite, through the influence of the prelate, and at a great expence, was made chancellor to Lewis VII. king of France. The bishop, with much sorrow, saw him die before him, at Auckland, in the year 1189: He was interred in the new gallilee erected by his father, near the shrine of St Bede.

Vanity was his predominant passion, and presided over all his actions. His ambition was unbounded, and his arrogance could brook no contradiction. He was jealous of indignities, which his insolence brought upon him, and was unremitting in his indignation where his pride was wounded. To gratify his pre∣vailing bent, he was guilty of vile extortions, and grievous oppressions on his people. His magnificent works were monuments which pride raised to his me∣mory, inscribed with the perpetuation of those sins he committed on his distressed province. In early life he was esteemed a man of wit, subtlety of genius, and great perspicuity; but, in his latter years, in the bargains he would have made with the king, he appears under that blindness the hermit Godric predicted. His magnificence was princely; and his carriage held that countenance of dignity that demanded obeisance.

<P>On the bishop's decease, Hugh Bardolph seized the Castle of Durham for the king. The burgesses deposited the keys of their city at the shrine of St Cuthbert. Bardolph's soldiers petitioned the convent they should be delivered to their hands, protesting they would hold them for the protection of the rights and liberties of the convent and See. This being refused, one of them in chief command, Ranulph de Grisby had the audacity to enter the church, and take the keys from the fere∣tory: But the sacrilege was not committed with impunity, the perpetrator suffering

<P>During the vacancy of the See, which continued near two years, the convent, as well as the people of the palatinate, suffered much injury and oppression from the officers of the crown *. It doth not appear what occasioned a delay in the election of a bishop: Geof. of Coldingham says, messengers from the convent were sent to consult the king's pleasure touching the person they should nominate, when PHILIP DE POICTEU, a native of Aquitaine, one of the king's privy councellors, and chief favourites, was at length pointed out to them as a person most agreeable to the sovereign; on whose election the monks were promised the royal protection, and full confirma∣tion of the liberties they held in former reigns. He was elected at Northallerton (according to Wharton) by the monks assembled there, in the presence of Hubert archbishop of Canterbury, in the month of November 1195; but Geof. of Col∣dingham says, he was elected in the chapter-house on the 11th January. Those various dates are easily reconciled by a supposition, that, in full chapter, the act at Northallerton was confirmed at Durham, and then recorded there. He was or∣dained priest by Henry bishop of Landaff at Durham, the 15th day of June 1196, and was consecrated at Rome by pope Celestine, in the Lateran church, on the 20th of April 1197. Geof. of Coldingham postpones his consecration to the 12th kal. May 1198<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ang. Sac. p. 726.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is requisite, that, in this place, some farther attention should be paid to the coinage of money, which was permitted in this See, and practised in the time of bishop Galfrid, of which notice has already been taken. The privilege, in the present bishop's time, was revived, or re-granted by the king. According to Mr Noble, <Q>When K. Stephen, and prince Henry of Anjou, afterwards our king “Henry II. in 1153, came to a compromise, it was agreed, that the king should be reinstated in all the regalities usurped, in all different parts, by his nobles<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Probably this was at the desire of Prince Henry, as he seems early to have directed his attention to the purity and elegance of his money; for when he came over to England in an. 1149, he brought a minter with him who excelled in the art of coining, and whose money was superior to any before that time. This coinage was called the duke's money. Henry then saw with concern the usurpations of the nobles and pre∣lates, particularly in coining their own money, and did all in his power to check it. After this agreement, Stephen and Henry's essigies appear together upon the English money, as Stephen and his son Eustace's did before. These types probably were copied from the coins of the eastern emperors.—Vide Stow, from Hoveden, p. 146, 147.—Noble's Notes, p. 6.</NOTE>; by which no doubt was particularly meant the coining of money. It is observable, that there is nothing here said of the ecclesiastics, many of whom were equally culpable: Probably Henry was fearful of offending them, as they had been his warmest partizans; and it would have been difficult to have settled
<PB N="185" REF="230"/>their respective claims, as some of them had, before Stephen's reign, possessed a mint, and others that king permitted by grants to coin money, as was the case probably with these bishops of Durham. It was therefore a difficult point to go upon, as it would have been disgraceful to Stephen to have annulled the grants he had given. But it was very different with respect to the nobles, who ”could have no pretensions to the right of coining money<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The only coin, either of the barons or prelates, which we know of, is one of Henry bishop of Win∣chester, brother to Stephen. On the obverse, is the king's effigy, with a crosier, instead of a sceptre, in his hand, and with his own name and title, and the bishop's on the reverse. Whether the money of the other bishops was any ways like this, it is impossible to ascertain. Mr Colebrook gave a coin, with the name of Rodbertus, to Robert earl of Gloucester. But Mr Pegge, who is universally allowed to be the most skilful of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> antiquaries, has refuted that gentleman's arguments, and replaced it to Robert duke of Normandy, son of the Conquer <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; so that nothing can be known of what type the coms of the nobles were.—Vide Mr Pegge on the name of Rodbertus.—Archaeol. vol. v. p. 390.—Mr Noble's notes to p. 7.

<P><Q>“This abuse, however, does not appear to have been redressed, not even of the nobles, during the reign of king Stephen. But Henry the Second, when he acceded, put a stop to these encroachments of both barons and prelates: He still, however, permitted certain cities and abbies to have mints; but pro∣bably these were such as had that right prior to Stephen's reign, as it is most likely, that, by this regulation, he placed the mints in the same state as they were in during the reign of his grandfather king Henry I. and consequently the bishops of Durham would be dispossessed of theirs; for, though Stephen might give them a charter for that purpose, yet it would undoubtedly be annulled by Henry, as given by a person not legally authorised to grant such privilege. Mr Leake's account of Henry's proceedings with respect to the mints, in the be∣ginning of his reign, in some measure confirms what has been said above. The king, says he, seems to have been the first, from the Conquest, that made any considerable regulations in money affairs. He suppressed the mints, which every earl and baron had in king Stephen's time; altered the coin, which was corrupt∣ed by counterfeiters, by the iraporites or usurers, who were grievously punished. He also granted liberty of coining to certain cities and abbies, allowing them ”one staple, and two punchions at a rate, with certain restrictions<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Leake's Account Eng. Money, p. 52.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“These charter-mints remained, upon this footing no doubt, during his reign; but we are certain, that, in that of his successor, Richard the First, the episco∣pal mint of Durham was revived; for Stow, from Hoveden, writes, that in the year 1196, king Richard granted licence unto Philip his chaplain, late made bishop of Durham, to coyne money in the city of Durham, which liberty none of his predecessors had enjoyed for long time before<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Stow's Chron. p. 162.—Pegge, p. 84.</NOTE>. This long time will be found, perhaps, to be forty-two years, viz. from the death of king Stephen to the 8th year of K. Richard I. The learned Mr Pegge is of the same opi∣nion. Probably Richard, who was often greatly distressed for money, received a gratuity for the renewal of this privilege, as he had for many others granted ”by him to his nobles and prelates.</Q></P>
<PB N="186" REF="231"/>
<P><Q>“However, though the bishop and his successors might coin money after this time, yet it is not to be supposed that they, or any of the other bishops, who had the same powers, affected any peculiar distinctions upon their money from that which was coined in the royal mints; for Stow writes, that, in the year 1247, the coin was so sore clipped, that it was thought good to change the same, and to make it baser. Whereupon stamps were graven, of a new inci∣sion or cut; and, being sent to the abbey of Bury in Suffolk, to Canterbury, Divelen, and other places, forbidding to use any other stamp than was used in the exchange or mint at London, all the old stamps were called in. This plainly evinces, that there was, at that time, but one type used throughout the king∣dom.”</Q></P>
<P>The officers of the mints were called <HI>moneyours, essayers,</HI> and <HI>custodes cuneorum.</HI> These mints and officers were under the supervisal and direction of the chief justi∣cier, or the treasurer and barons of the exchequer. Unhappy quarrels soon pre∣vailed, and long subsisted between the bishop and the convent, being greatly fo∣mented by the archdeacon, who was the prelate's nephew, by whom it was insinu∣ated, that the monks, in many instances, had usurped an authority they never be∣fore exercised, and were encroaching daily on the prelate's prerogative; which at length grew up to an implacable animosity, and acts of great violence ensued. Wharton has repeated a long detail of those contentions, from Geoffrey de Col∣dingham, which are not momentous enough to merit a prolix rehearsal. The bishop carried his persecution to very outrageous heights. He beset the church with troops, commanding fire and smoke to be put the windows and doors: He prohibited the carrying provisions into the convent; blocked up the passages to the mill; broke down the fishery-banks; overturned the furnace or oven in Elvet; destroyed St Godric's fish-dam at Finchale, and guarded the north gates of the castle, so that no one could pass or repass. He cut off the communication of water from the castle fountain, and destroyed the cattle of the convent. He ex∣communicated the prior and the whole chapter for refusing him admittance to the chapter-house at the time of their convention. With a tumultuous mob he inter∣rupted them in the holy offices on the festival of St Cuthbert; broke in upon the altar; laid impious hands on the sacred furniture, dragging forth the prior and monks ministring there. Geoffrey says, so infamous a transaction had not been known in the annals of the church, except the assassination of Becket. Even to repeat so much is irksome, and wounds the ear. This author is certainly partial in saying, the bishop's wrath was excited by the archdeacon's whispers; for it is improbable such acts of violence could take place without some grounds and real causes. Perhaps the convent were taking unwarrantable measures to extend their own power and authority. It is impossible for a dispassionate reader to conceive any prelate would break out into such inordinate acts of violence, without some very striking injury; but what it was lies undiscovered<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ang.

<P>Not long after he was settled in his See, the king received a fatal wound by an arrow at the siege of a castle in le Limosin, which he beset under an oppressive claim of a treasure found in that part of his dominions. The events of this warlike prince's life were various; his active spirit made him eager for feats of arms; and his whole life was embroiled in warfare. In the account of bishop Pulsey's life, his unwarrantable modes of extorting money was sussiciently shewn at his outset on the crusade; and the vicissitude of circumstances which ensued, all required vast supplies, which were extorted from his subjects by innumerable acts of oppression. When he came to the crown, he made a tremendous acknowledg∣ment of his being accessary to the death of his father, and Providence seems to have held a vindictive eye over him through every circumstance of his life; for whilst he was vainly spending the best blood and treasures of England, in the frenzy of a crusade, his country was involved in anarchy by the arrogance of an imperious regent, who usurped an authority that did not even appertain to his sovereign. On his return from Syria, he was trepanned and put in bonds by a banditti of robbers, who, contrary to every law human and divine, disregarded not only his royal dignity, but the common principles of civilized nations, and held him a prisoner. If the ferocity of the natives of this island, who disgraced humanity by the ignominious manner in which king William of Scotland was brought before king Richard, is a subject of lamentation, it is equally such to see the king of England, by the command of the emperor, brought before an assem∣bly of the states at Haguenaw, by miscreants who were in the most abject bonds of vassalage. The deputies sent by the queen and council to acquaint the king with what passed in his dominions, met in the road the intrepid prince, to whose sword Palestine so lately trembled, ignorminiously conducted, like the meanest criminal, in wretched apparel, crouching on a mule, and bound hand and foot. The me∣tancholy sight drew tears from their astonished eyes; and as they wept, he lifted, up his shackled hand, and dropt a tear. The griefs of imprisonment were ren∣dered still more pungent by the treason and intrigues of his brother. At length, for a ransom of 100,000 marks, he was set at liberty. Soon after his return, he consiscated his brother's lands, and declared him incapable of succeding to the throne. Having settled all commotions in England, he speeded to take his revenge on the king of France, to whose intrigues were justly attributed much of the sor∣rows of his captivity. This new kindled war brought nothing but encreased sor∣rows to both countries. Neither sovereign reaped any material advantage. A truce succeeded to five years bloodshed, in which interval the king lost his life, as before remarked. Before his death, he was reconciled to his brother, and fa∣voured him by his will. His body was buried at the foot of his father's tomb, at Fontevravd, in token of his contrition for the grief he had occasioned him. His heart was carried to Roan, in testimony of his love to the Normans; and his bowels to Poictiers, in contempt of their disloyalty. His valour was admired by
<PB N="188" REF="233"/>the whole world, and his conduct in war was judicious and generous. He sup ported great magnificence, but it was by extortion, and the oppression of his sub∣jects; and his splendor was clouded by their tears. His pride held him above mankind: The highest he regarded with contempt, and the lowest he spurned as slaves. His lasciviousness was disgraceful to humanity, and he was reproached to his face with unnatural crimes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is said, that being one day admonished by Fulk curate of Nevilly, a man samous for his zeal, to throw off those wicked habits which were commonly called his <HI>three daughters,</HI> he replied jestingly, that it was his design; and to that end he resolved to give the first <HI>(pride)</HI> to the templars, the second <HI>(avarice)</HI> to the monks, and the third <HI>(inst)</HI> to the bishops.—Hoveden, p. 789.</NOTE>. He reigned ten years, of which he was only eight months in England. He was the first sovereign of this country who bore in his shield three lions passant; and before whose time seals, with any distinct impression, were not used by our kings.</P>
<P>The accession of king John was immediately succeeded by the king of Scot∣land's claim of Northumberland; on which Eustace de Vesey was commissioned to assure him, that, immediately on king John's return from Normandy, he should have full satisfaction in his demands. Soon after the coronation, king William of Scotland was summoned to attend the sovereign at Nottingham; afterwards he was summoned to attend at York; to both which places he only sent commissioners: But, on the third summons, he attended at Lincoln. The bishop of Durham re∣ceived him on the frontier, and escorted him through his territories; at the boun∣dary of which he was received by the sheriff and barons of Yorkshire. By the convention of king Richard, the kings of Scotland were granted in their passage to and from the English court, a daily pension of money, to be paid by the she∣riffs of each county through which they travelled; together with a portion of bread, wine, candles, and spices. The bishop of Durham, having all temporal authority within his jurisdiction, was bound to give personal attendance in his pa∣latinate, as the sheriffs of other liberties. The delegates sent by the king on this last summons, were Philip bishop of Durham, Roger Bigot earl of Norfolk, Henry de Bohun earl of Hereford, David earl of Huntington, Roger de Lacy constable of Chester, Eustace de Vesey, Robert de Ros, and Robert Fitz-Roger sheriff of Northumberland<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hoveden.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>It appears that our bishop was one of those counsellors who induced the king to be guilty of innumerable severities upon the convent of Canterbury, touching their election of a metropolitan, and, in that matter, to shew a public contempt of the authority of the See of Rome; which in consequence brought on an in∣terdict and excommunication against the king and his abettors, in which this pre∣late was involved, together with the bishops of Winchester and Norwich.

<P>It is very difficult to conceive this prelate's character from the short anecdotes historians have given of him. His contention with the monks, and his attach∣ment to king John, plainly evince his being a weak man, of a froward and ob∣stinate disposition. To point out the vices of the age, it may be necessary to no∣tice some canons, a few years preceding this period, for the regulation of the clergy. At a synod held at Westminster, by the eighth canon the clergy were pro∣hibited the diversion of hunting; and, by the twelfth, were restrained from prac∣tising the profession of arms. At the synod of Canterbury, A. D. 1175, the cler∣gy were forbid appearing at drinking entertainments, taverns, and public houses; not to interfere in trials where life or limb was in judgment; not to wear long hair, nor to exercise merchandize, or take farms; and not to appear in the figure of military men. Such dissipations had crept in among the clergy, and such devia∣tions from the dignity of the ecclesiastical function.</P>
<P>After a year was elapsed from the death of the bishop, the pope sent his mandatory letters to the prior and monks, requiring them to elect a prelate. This threw them into much perplexity; on the one hand dreading the austerity of the king; on the other, the frown of the apostolical See. The churches of England every where laboured under grievous oppressions and injuries, and the See of Dur∣ham was not free from the exactions of the crown, notwithstanding the exemp∣tions granted by former sovereigns, of which, in times of such public calamity, the people of St Cuthbert's territories had no means of availing themselves. In the midst of these troubles, prior Bertram departed this life. On this occasion the convent found favour with the king, though little hoped for, who granted them his consent freely to chuse a person most agreeable to themselves; on which they elected William, a native of the city of Durham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Angl. Sac p. 730.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>During this period, the reconciliation took place between the pope and king John.</P>
<P>The prior and monks, previous to that event, had proceeded to elect a bishop, and accordingly chose Richard dean of Salisbury, but, for several months, kept the whole transaction secret, through fear of offending the king, as is alledged, whose opinion or pleasure they had not consulted. At length they discovered what they had done to the pope's legate in England, and the archbishop of Canterbury<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Soon afterwards the legate came to Durham to enquire into the transaction, when the convent produced the pope's letters mandatory, and discovered every thing they had done in pursuance thereof. The legate declared they had elected a very pro∣per and learned person, but that the king ought to have assented thereto: That now the pope and their sovereign were unanimous, to offend one was to incur the displeasure of both; on which he warned them of the afflictions they might bring on themselves. He then produced letters from the holy See, commanding him, as the convent had been so dilatory in electing their prelate, to deprive them now of that power, giving him authority, in the name of the apostolical See, to appoint a proper person to the vacant bishopric; whereupon he nominated John bishop of

The convent found themselves involved in an embarrassment from which they knew not how to be extricated, or to which of the two evils to incline; either to confirm the legate's appointment, in which they should sin against con∣science, or refuse the same, and incur the solemn sentence which the legate was directed to pronounce. At length they consented to submit the whole to the pope's will; to which the legate replied, what he had already done was by that authority, which rendered all further applications to the holy See unnecessary. Deliberating a short time on the matter, the convent assented to the translation of the bishop of Norwich, which took place on the 16th day of February 1214. Accordingly the pope, in the following month of October, annulled the election of the dean of Salisbury, and confirmed John Grey bishop of Norwich in this translation; but, previous to the day of confirmation, he departed this life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Geof. de Cold.—Ang. Sac. p. 731.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A contention now arose between the convent and the king, touching the next election; but they, in maintenance of their ancient privilege, elected Morgan the king's brother, as also brother of Galfrid archbishop of York, who was then prior of Beverley. He applied to Rome for consecration, but the king prevented it by discovering his spurious birth, king Henry having begot him on the wife of Ralph Bloeth, a knight. The pope would have dispensed with this disqualification, if the pretension of being a king's son was disclaimed, and he would insist on his birth as Bloeth's son: But Morgan declared his being of royal issue was to him the dearest honour upon earth, which he would not disclaim for any preferment; and therefore the election was pronounced void<NOTE PLACE="dagger">Ibid. p. 732.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From the foregoing circumstances, it appears, a very long vacancy happened in the See, viz. from the death of Philip de Poicteu, who, according to the best au∣thorities, died in the beginning of the year 1208, to the time that Richard dean of Salisbury was elected, which, as Wharton judiciously conceives, happened five years after bishop Philip's death, and not five months, as Geoffrey of Coldingham alledges; and, his election being superseded, that of John Grey bishop of Nor∣wich happened in the beginning of the year 1214; from whence to the time of electing Morgan prior of Beverley, who was disqualified by the operation of the canons against illegitimate children, and the election of Richard de Marisco, which Wharton, with clear argument and many proofs, dates about the 6th day of December 1217, is a period of nine years and a half<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 723.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Wharton observes, that the history of the church in this period is perplexed and uncertain; and no wonder when it is considered what disorder and confusion took place in the state. In the year 1209, the king, with a powerful army, was in the north, to demand satisfaction in Scotland for various insults offered his crown, and injuries done to his people. He lay at Norham with his troops, whilst the Scottish king assembled his army at Roxburgh; but, by the interposition of the nobles of both nations, hostilities were suspended. Eustace de Vesey married Margaret the
<PB N="193" REF="240"/>king of Scotland's daughter, and Robert de Ros was his son-in-law, the most powerful barons in Northumberland: Add to their interest that of Patrick earl of Dunbar, who married Ada, another daughter of that sovereign. Under such in∣fluence, the Scottish nation were induced to terms of peace. The armies were disbanded, and a conference was agreed upon to be held at Newcastle; but the king of Scotland falling sick, a truce only took place, which was succeeded by a renewal of warlike preparations, and the king of England again brought an army into the north, as far as Bambrough, which Fordun describes to be very formidable, there being embodied therewith 13,000 Welsh troops, 1500 English knights, and 7000 cross-bowmen. But though the king of Scotland levied a great army at Melros, and shewed much inclination for war, a convention took place, at the intercession of the great men of both nations, at Norham, where a treaty of peace was concluded. Besides these troubles, John laboured under the pope's interdict and excommunication. A gift of his crown was made by the See of Rome to Lewis of France; and an invasion from the powers of Europe, in a cru∣sade against his dominions, by virtue of the same authority, was prepared. Add to these, a conspiracy formed against him by his subjects, after receiving an abso∣lution from their oath of allegiance. Eustace de Vesey, and Robert Fitz-Water, were chiefs in this design; on discovery of which, they fled the kingdom, and Vesey's Castle of Alnwick, at the king's command, was dismantled. Those troubles did not terminate on the king's submission, and making peace with the See of Rome, which took place in the year 1213. The preparations for an in∣vasion from France still proceeded; no terms of reconciliation with that kingdom being concluded until the autumn of the year 1214. No sooner were the foreign alarms subsided, than Cardinal Langton, now admitted to the See of Canterbury, set on foot that glorious purpose which renders his memory amiable to every Eng∣lish mind, and his name immortal in the annals of his country. The weakness of a prince has, in innumerable instances, been attended with various efforts to ex∣tend the royal prerogative, to promote absolute monarchy, and enslave the people. John's indolence, or imbecility of mind, had already occasioned the loss of that rich and extensive territory which his ancestors possessed on the continent. His folly was expressed in various incidents in the conduct of his government at home; and as esseminate cowardice is always attended with abject cruelty, he had display∣ed various attrocious acts; in the death of his nephew and captive Arthur duke of Bretaigne, whose blood was on his own hand; the perpetual imprisonment of his niece Eleanor of Bretaigne; putting away Avisa of Gloucester; the sa∣crifice of the Welsh hostages, and various meaner instances in the course of his government. He had defiled the bed of many of his barons, and debauched their daughters; had incroached on the privileges of the church; and, with unremit∣ting severity, loaded the subject with the heaviest exactions. He laid the fences of his forests open, that his beasts of chace might be let in upon every private estate. Established laws were no restraint to his desires; and his will was the on∣ly rule by which his actions were maintained. His opposition to the pope was not derived from principle, but pride; and the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra in which he attempted to shake
<PB N="194" REF="241"/>that jurisdiction, sufficiently testified his ignorance and arbitrary mind. His folly was displayed to the height in the despair he yielded to, mixed with the madness of resentment under the pope's persecution, when he offered to turn Mahometan, and hold his crown of the Turkish empire. John's struggle with the holy See no doubt laid the foundation of succeeding events; but many of the blessings then in the womb of futurity are to be attributed to his folly and want of foresight. His character sufficiently justified the immediate procedures of his people. Cardinal Langton<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As nothing was more opposite to the barons' design of recovering their ancient privileges, than the vassalage to which John had subjected the kingdom, Cardinal Langton solemnly protested against it, and laid his protestation upon the altar. Pope Innocent having notice of Langton's protestation, was extremely in∣censed that a cardinal should act so directly contrary to the interests of the holy See. He durst not howe∣ver sall upon him, for fear of putting the whole kingdom in commotion, and inducing the English to join with Langton in defence of their liberties.—Rapin, p. 274.</NOTE>, actuated by a principle of zeal for his native country, he being by birth an Englishman, and from a desire of restoring the liberty of the subject, raised a storm against the king more formidable than he had hitherto struggled with. He found the exigency of the times required the barons should be roused from the lethargy in which they bent their heads to the impetuous sovereign; that the charter of Henry I. in which their liberties were protected, should be held forth to the people, that its infringements might be redressed, and its powers established. He called upon them, in memory of their ancestors, to attend to the injuries al∣ready prepared for them; and, in the name of posterity, animated them to pro∣tect from slavery succeeding generations. The English, no longer able to support the load of their encreasing oppressions and injuries, and fired with the love of their country, with a noble exertion, glorious in history, and stamped on the name of England with immortal honour, in the year 1215, obtained from the trembling and reluctant tyrant, at Runnemede, Magna Charta, and the charter of the forests, supported by commissioners, who should restrain regal jurisdiction with∣in the prescribed limits. The interposition of the pope, who now as abjectly ser∣ved his basest purposes as before he opposed with spirit his malignity and tyranny, did not avail. The struggle became more ardent; the overstretched powers of Rome, in this instance, first shook her authority here. The king, in disappointed pride, reflected, under an ignominious blush, on the good act he had involuntarily performed. He raged with vexation and wrath, and determined to remove, even with the ruthless hands of cruelty, warfare, and destruction, the blessing he had bestowed upon his people. He brought in an army of foreign auxiliaries, who were invited over to take for their reward what their arms should seize. He made his progress to the north, and desolation marked his steps. The country smoked in ashes, and the soil was stained with the bloody marks of brutal ferocity and implacable wrath. The territories of this See were not spared; the abbey of Col∣dingham was plundered, and the town of Berwick burnt; the tyrant disgracing royalty by putting the firebrand to the very house where he had been hospitably lodged. The dismay arising from these cruel devastations occasioned a desperate measure, the calling in aid from France, and, as some authors say, offering the crown to Lewis. Whilst John on one hand was wasting the possessions of his ad∣verse
<PB N="195" REF="242"/>barons, Alexander king of Scotland, with a large army, added to the mi∣sery of the people, by committing equal devastations on the lands of the king's adherents. Hugh de Baliol and Philip de Ulcotes were John's commissioners for governing the territory between Tweed and Tees, and for that purpose retained a powerful force. This occasioned the Scottish army, as they marched through the county of Durham, to come before the Castle of Barnard, which then belonged to Hugh Baliol. Meditating an attack by storm, the king of Scotland and Eu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ace de Vesey went to reconnoitre the place; when a bowman from one of the out-posts shot a fatal shaft, which slew Eustace on the spot. Alexander made a progress as far as Dover, where Lewis of France lay, now exacting the homage of the English barons as their sovereign. Such were the dreadful vicissitudes this nation was decreed to submit to: But Providence, in the interval, snatched off the tyrant, then resting from his horrid operations at the Castle of Newark.</P>
<P>The accession of Henry the Third, though little more than nine years of age, (an event which took place on the 19th day of October 1216), made a happy change in the affairs of England, under the regency of William Mareschal earl of Pembroke, a man of great sidelity, wisdom, and courage. A defection had arisen among the English barons, who were disgusted with Lewis's arrogance and impru∣dent measures; and their affections bending towards their natural prince, a breach soon ensued, which brought on a battle, in which Lewis's army was totally defeat∣ed near Lincoln, in the month of May 1217. This event was followed by the destruction of a large fleet bringing over reinforcements. The consequence was, that Lewis returned to France, and made a total renunciation of all claim to this kingdom.</P>
<P>So much was necessary to shew, that the long vacancy of the See, and the con∣fusion and uncertainty of the history of this province, were the natural conse∣quences of the distraction of the state. So that it is probable, according to Whar∣ton, our bishop's consecration did not take place till after Henry the Third's ac∣cession, and that it happened in the year 1217. In what manner the revenue was applied during this period, there is no account: But it is reasonable to presume, that, whilst John was making such enormous demands from his barons and clergy as a seventh of their moveables, the produce of this rich See, during nine years vacancy, would not be a neglected object.</P>
<P>Richard de Marisco occurs, in the year 1211, as chanellor of England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Floril.</NOTE>. A charter of John's, noted by Prynn<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prynn, v. ii. p. 290.</NOTE>, dated in October 1213, is expressed to be granted <HI>per manum Ricardi de Marescis.</HI> By the rolls of chancery it is shewn, that Richard de Marisco, archdeacon of Richmond and Northum∣berland, resigned the seals to the king at Ospreng.

Richard dean of Salis∣bury was elected bishop by the convent, as Geossrey of Goldingham says, five months before the pope's legate dictated to them the election of John bishop of Norwich. This transaction is dated on the 16th of February
<PB N="196" REF="243"/>1214, grounded on the legate's letter to the pope<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prynn, v. ii. p. 353.</NOTE>, dated the 24th of that month. On the 22d day of May 1214, the king recommended Richard de Marisco to the chapter of Winchester, and, on the 28th day of June, he was elected bishop of that See, under a false report that their prelate Peter was dead. On the 14th of the same month, the pope sent letters to the king touching the affairs of the See of Durham, wherein a refusal of confirmation of the convent's election was set forth, as being grounded on the circumstance of its having been made without the king's consent. The pope transmitted to the king the convent's certificate of their election, signed by William the prior and 40 monks. The matter still re∣maining in suspence, the monks petitioned the king to give his consent; to which, on the 6th September 1214, he sent his absolute denial, with some reprehensions for their contumacy. John bishop of Norwich died in the month of October following. Morgan was then elected, who, before the conclusion of the same year, was rejected. The Durham annals place this election in 1213; and the same annals set forth, that RICHARD DE MARISCO received the bishopric from the nomination of Gualo the legate, about the feast of St Nicholas 1214, and was consecrated by Walter bishop of York 22d June 1215. These are inconsistencies easily refuted; for Walter did not obtain the archbishopric before the month of November in that year, and the 22d day of June did not fall on the Lord's day. Gualo the legate did not arrive in England before the middle of the year 1216, and he retired the middle of the year 1218. Another author says, the bishop was con∣secrated 24th July 1218: But this assertion is no more plausible than the former, that not being a dominical day. It therefore appears that Richard, at the pro∣curation of Gualo, was elected about the 6th day of December 1217, and was consecrated on the 24th of June 1218. Robert de Graystanes says, he was conse∣crated about the feast of John the Baptist, and that he died in the 8th year of his episcopacy. It is certain he departed this life on the 1st day of May 1226. M. Paris says, he presided about nine years. If we admit he was elected in 1216, and consecrated 25th June 1217, it would make good his assertion.</P>
<P>Such is the substance of what Wharton says touching the uncertainty of the time for our bishop's accession to the See, and the examples he brings to six the date he adopts. Robert de Graystanes says, that, supported by the king's ap∣probation, he gave great molestation to the monks with respect to their rights and liberties, some of which he absolutely took away, and others he altered. There is no evidence in the records of the church of any such matters; but yet it is generally believed he was profuse and magnificent, sparing no expence in the indulgence of his vanities and gratifications; and, in order to maintain his enor∣mous prodigality, he got money by every stratagem his love of pleasure could in∣cite, or invention devise.</P>
<P>Soon after his coming to the See, he was in commission with the archbishop of York to absolve the king of Scotland from the censures of the See of Rome,
<PB N="197" REF="244"/>for which purpose he was at Berwick on the 1st December 1217<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chron. Melros.</NOTE>. Three days afterwards, the king's mother also received absolution from the hands of the bishop of Durham.</P>
<P>In the second year of his episcopacy he appeared to have been reconciled to the convent; and, in consequence, confirmed to them, by his charter, all their liberties and privileges, according to the tenor of the charter of their former pre∣late William the first. He also confirmed and appropriated to them, the churches of Dalton, Aycliff, and Pittington.</P>
<P>He was arbiter in a contest between the abbot and convent of Alnwick, and the vicar of the church of Chatton, touching that vicarage; in which he ad∣judged, that the collation to that church was in the bishops of Durham. He granted and decreed, that the tithes belonging to that church should be appropri∣ated to the abbey of Alnwick. This instrument is dated at Auckland, in the 8th year of his episcopacy; and it is here noted as the first act of the bishop of Dur∣ham which has a confirmation under the seal of the convent<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">O'ib's Christi fidelib's has l'ras visuris vel audituris Tho. prior &amp; co'ventus Dun. eccl'ie s. in d'no No∣v'it univ'rsitas v'ra nos inspexisse ordinaco'em d'ni Ric'i Dun. epi. f'c' am sup' eccl'iam de Chatton sub hac forma.

<P>Notwithstanding the favourable appearance of cordiality between the bishop and convent before observed, the dissentions between them encreased to a violent de∣gree, so as to occasion various suits at law, touching the bishop's infringements of
<PB N="198" REF="245"/>the rights of the church. The prior and monks, in retaliation of the injuries they sustained from his extravagance and exactions, accused him before the pope, of bloodshed, simony, adultery, sacrilege, rapine, perjury, and various dilapida∣tions. To hear and determine these flagrant charges, the pope appointed the bishops of Salisbury and Ely his delegate judges: But the bishop of Durham disdaining to submit to their determination, appealed to the See of Rome, where, it is al∣ledged, his money prevailed so far as to soften the pope's ire, and protract the suit, in which no definitive sentence was pronounced in his life-time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ang. Sac. p 734.</NOTE>. The suits depending in the courts of England were prosecuted with the greatest inveteracy. As the bishop was travelling to London in the year 1226, with a troop of lawyers, in all the bitterness of professed litigiousness and prosecution, he took the mona∣stery of Peter borough in his way, where, on the first day of May, he halted, to rest all night, and was found dead in his bed in the morning. He was in high health and vigour when he retired to his chamber, so that his exit was not with∣out suspicion of foul play. It is said he left the See encumbered with a debt of 10,000 marks. He was buried in the chapter-house at Durham on the 5th day of May, and the following epitaph was written to his memory by one of the monks of that house.</P>

<P>The king, under the influence of the earl of Pembroke, gained the esteem of his subjects, and the wise conduct of that minister promised a happy reign, but his death opened a scene of calamities which overwhelmed the land. During the earl's administration, the king swore to maintain the charters granted by his fa∣ther; but no sooner was that great man removed, than innovations began, and great advances were attempted against the liberty of the subject. The peace which had subsisted some time between England and Scotland, through the pernicious advice of evil ministers, was disturbed, by reviving the claim of sovereignty over Scotland, in which the pope, by fallacious memorials, was induced to take a part, and, by his bull, required the king of Scotland to do the homage demanded by Henry, in order, as is therein alledged, to preserve the tranquillity of the king∣doms. The king of Scotland, on the other hand, so far from yielding to the claim, sent his ambassadors to Henry to demand delivery of the counties of Nor∣thumberland, Westmoreland, and Cumberland, as his right of inheritance. Those matters brought on a conference at Newcastle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fordun.—Chron. Melros. M. Paris says at York.</NOTE>. After much altercation, the Scottish king's claim seems to be suspended, or compounded for, by Henry then granting him lands, of eighty marks yearly value, in other parts of England, in order that the northern border might not suffer mutilation.</P>
<P>The king of England's marriage with Eleanor of Provence took place in the beginning of the year 1236, to the solemnization of which the king and queen of Scotland were invited; and, for their safe conduct, the archbishop of York, the bishop of Durham, William de Vesey, Gilbert de Umsraville, Roger Bertram, John de Veteripont, and John, the son of Geoffrey sheriff of York, were ap∣pointed escorts. The king's marriage brought him under the influence of a new set of favourites. His weak mind was uncertain and fluctuating: The person whom to day he caressed, the next received his frown, or was discarded. An in∣consistency appeared in his resolutions, which kept the affairs of government in perplexity and confusion. Like the fluctuations and bablings of an idiot's affec∣tions, he seldom retained the same opinion two days together, but in the morning was disgusted with the man who, over night, gratified his propensities; and he laughed or frowned with a kind of involuntary impulse, as an infant that caresses and quarrels with its toys. He did homage to the pope, and dreaded his scourge with an abject puerility. He was induced by wicked counsellors (among his fo∣reign
<PB N="200" REF="247"/>connections) to deny the execution of his father's charters; and thence a combustion took place in his realm, which filled the time of our prelate's episco∣pacy.</P>
<P>The king was desirous that Luke, his chaplain, should succeed to the bishopric of Durham, and, it is said, threatened the monks, that if they refused to elect him, they should not have a prelate for seven years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A brawling matter befell the same year, A. D. 1228, between the prior and convent of Durham, and K. Hen. III. upon this occasion. After the death of Richard bishop of Durham, the prior and chapter of the said church came to the king to obtain licence for electing their bishop. The king offered to them one Lucas, a chaplain of his, requiring them instantly to elect him their bishop. To this the monks answered, that they would receive no man but by their order of canonical election; meaning, belike, by their canoni∣cal election, thus much, when as they elect either some monk out of their own company, or else some monkish priest after their own liking. Contrary, the king again sendeth word unto them, and bound it with an oath, that they should tarry seven years without a bishop, unless they would admit the aforesaid Lucas to that place of dignity. All which notwithstanding, the monks, proceeding in their election, refused the said Lucas, and preferred another clerk of theirs, named William. archdeacon of Worcester, and him they presented to the king; but the king bringing in exceptions and causes against the party, would not ad∣mit him. Then the monks, in all hasty speed sent up to Rome certain of their convent, to have their elec∣tion ratified by the authority apostolical. On the other side, the king, likewise hearing, sendeth also to Rome, against the monks, the bishop of Chester and the prior of Lantony, on his behalf, to withstand the purpose of the monks. And so the matter being traversed with great altercation, on both sides, did hang in suspence, till at length thus it was concluded between both, that neither Master William nor yet Lucas should be taken, but that Richard bishop of Sarum should be translated to Durham, and be bishop there.—Fox's Acts &amp; Mon. v. i. p. 307. Vide M. Paris:—Also Stavely's Romish Horseleech, p. 20.
<P>N. B. Lucas was dean of St Martin le Grand.</P></NOTE>. The convent conceiving him unworthy of so high a dignity, and afraid of submitting to any innovations on the freedom of election, rejected Luke, and elected William de Stichill, arch∣deacon of Worcester, and the king's chaplain, in the annals of Tewksbury called <HI>Williclmus Scotus.</HI> Displeased at this opposition to his will, the king sent his proc∣tors to Rome to oppose William's confirmation; and the election was in conse∣quence annulled, the pope pronouncing against the same for want of spiritual form in the ceremony, alledging that it ought to have proceeded through the in∣spiration of the Holy Spirit; whereas it was a mere egotism of the electors, who separately pronounced the election as his own will. They were commanded to nominate some other sit person; on which they petitioned that RICHARD POOR<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p 333.—Robert de Graystanes.—Ang. Sac. p. 734.</NOTE>, bishop of Salisbury, whom they had in the year 1213 elected to the See, but was then rejected, might be translated to Durham. The pope would willingly have overturned this second nomination, as being irregular, but the monks persisted in their request; and, on the 14th day of May 1228, by papal decree, he was trans∣lated to this See. He received the temporalities thereof on the 22d day of July, in the same year, the castles excepted, and was solemnly enthroned at Durham on the 4th day of September following. Why the castles were retained, is not said; but it is probable this was an act of over-stretched authority in the crown, and ad∣vised

<P>The bishop, at the time of his first election, was dean of Salisbury: In 1215, he was consecrated bishop of Chichester; and from thence, in 1217, translated to the See of Salisbury. Whilst bishop of Chichester, he purchased and gave to that See, Amport, which he bought of the church of Winchester. He was in high esteem with the people of Salisbury, having removed the episcopal seat from Old Sarum, and begun the building of the new cathedral. He founded a monastery of nuns at Tarrent in Dorsetshire, called the Charnell, and gave it to the queen, who chose it for her burial place. He also built an hospital for poor people, near the college of Vaulx in Salisbury. He was a man of great piety and pro∣found knowledge<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Robert de Craystanes.—Ang. Sac. p. 735.</NOTE>. M. Paris, speaking of him, says, <HI>Hunc eximioe sanctitatis &amp; profundoe scientioe virum.</HI> He discharged the enormous debt his predecessor left to encumber the possessions of the See, and lived in great cordiality with the con∣vent, with whom he entered into an agreement or convention for quieting their possessions, and preventing disputes with their prelates. He empowered them to pass sentence of excommunication on those who infringed the liberties of their church. The articles specified in the above-named agreement are to the following purport:—In pleas of the crown, and matters relative thereto, all attachments shall be made by the bishop's bailiff, with the view of the prior's bailiff, and pre∣sented in the bishop's court. In all complaints wherein imprisonment ought to be had by the laws of the land, the prisoner shall be confined in the bishop's gaol, until judgment shall pass in the bishop's court, or the party is relieved. In mat∣ters where life and limb are in judgment, execution shall be made by the bishop's officers. If any freeman, holding lands of the prior, be convicted of felony, or will not abide judgment, the bishop shall hold the offender's lands in his hands for a year and a day; and of the profits thereof, and other effects of the offender, the bishop shall take one half, and the prior the other, by the hands of the bishop's bailiff; and, after the expiration of that time, one half the lands shall be forfeited to the bishop, the other to the prior. Then follow certain rules for attendance on the justices at the pleas; <HI>(inter alias)</HI> wherever the bishop's justices shall hold pleas, and are attended by suitors of the bishop's people, thither also the free∣men
<PB N="202" REF="249"/>holding lands or fees of the prior shall resort, and be impleaded; and all amerciaments and profits arising from the prior's men, shall be divided between the bishop and prior. If any one in the prior's court shall impeach another, he shall immediately be delivered over to the bishop's officer; and if any one in the bishop's court shall impeach any of the prior's people, the matter shall be deter∣mined in the bishop's court; and whatever profits ensue, they shall be divided as before mentioned. If any of the prior's people shall come in mercy in the bi∣shop's court, in the presence of the bishop's officer, by the oaths of two of the bishop's men, and two of the prior's, he shall be amerced according to the na∣ture of his offence; saving to the freeman his tenement, the merchant his mer∣chandize, and the husbandman his team. Wreck of the sea, found on the prior's land, shall be divided between the bishop and prior. All customs touching the na∣vigation of the river Tees, except for passage of the <HI>batelli</HI> (boats) of the prior and convent to Billingham, shall be reserved to the bishop for ever. The prior shall have his free court, with soc and sac, toll and theam, and insangtheof, with all their appurtenances, except pleas of the crown and pleas of land, to be prosecuted by the bishop's writ; or, during a vacancy of the See, by the king's writ; saving always, to the prior and his successors, and their people, who have a court, the writ of right. If any of the prior's men shall be attached by the bishop's bailiff, for any matter within the jurisdiction of the prior's court, he, or his offi∣cers, shall have an exigent, and shall have the party <HI>ad horam &amp; terminum.</HI> If a thief is taken in the prior's lands, and judged in his court, execution shall be made by the prior's officer at the gallows of the bishop, without restraint. Likewife, where battle is adjudged in the prior's court, or any one is sentenced to the pil∣lory and tumbrell, execution shall be freely made by the prior's bailiff, at the place, pillory, and tumbrell of the bishop, without interruption. The customs and regulations touching malt, base bread, false measures of liquids, false weights, and false dry measure, of the prior's men in Elvet, in the old borough of Durham, shall remain to the monks of Durham freely and effectually for ever: And if any of them are found in the bishop's borough vending base bread, or by false weights or measures, justice shall be exercised by the bishop's bailiff; and if any fine or profit ensue, it shall be divided as before mentioned. The prior's people of Elvet, and of the old borough of Durham, shall use the same weights and measures as those in the bishop's borough. This convention is dated A. D. 1231, and was af∣terwards ratified and examplified by bishop Hatsield, in the ninth year of his epis∣copacy, A. D. 1353.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Omnibus, &amp;c.

<P>During the short time he presided in this See, there are no material acts of his in the records of the church, except the convention before noted; neither is he mentioned in our national history as taking any active part in the disturbances of his time. His sanctity and wisdom were special ornaments to his church in that aera; for M. Paris says<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 227.—An.

Sac. p. 735.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On Holy-rood day next succeeding the bishop's death, the archbishop of York and earl of Lincoln brought to the convent the king's letters for the election of a prelate, at the instance of their sovereign; requiring them, for the security of his realm, and to support the royal favour towards them, to elect the king's procura∣tion of Valencia. After deliberating thereon, the prior, the following day, gave for answer, that many of the brethren were absent, before whose return they could not with propriety proceed to the election; but, when they took on them that charge, they would be careful to nominate such a one as was at once a proper mi∣nister to God and the church, and faithful to the king and his realm<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Prynn, v. ii. p. 483.— Ang. Sac. p. 735.—Rob. de Graystanes.</NOTE>. The convent, not approving of the person pointed out by the king, elected Thomas of Melsonby, then their prior, who reluctantly submitted to their choice. The elec∣tion was in course represented in due form to the king and archbishop of Canter∣bury; but the king excepted thereto, alledging, that Thomas was inimical to his crown and government, having been prior of Coldingham, and, in that capacity,
<PB N="205" REF="252"/>had sworn allegiance to the king of Scotland; and, as the bishop of Durham held many strong fortified places within his See, on the confines of Scotland, it was of dangerous consequence to him and his kingdom, that his enemy, and a friend to the throne of Scotland, should hold them, especially one who had already done homage to that state: That, in the bishopric of Durham, there lay many sea-ports and maritime places, where troops from France and Flanders might be landed and received, to the imminent hazard of his government. He also alledged va∣rious personal charges against him, amongst which the most striking were, that he was distempered; that he had been guilty of simony in many cases, and had not sufficient learning for the prelate's function. The king, it is said, was render∣ed more averse to the confirmation of this election, by some indignant speeches thrown out abruptly by one of the monks in his presence. The exceptions were to be under the judgment of the archbishop of York, who was not able to find any just grounds to support the same, but yet, for fear of the king, delayed his sentence; on which a petition was sent to Rome, requiring the aid of the holy See to compel the archbishop to proceed to sentence at a short day. Robert de Esden sub-prior, Lawrence de Upsetlington, and Alan the chamberlain, were dis∣patched from the convent on this matter, Robert de Hexham waiting their arrival at Rome. William de la Hay attended the monks, but they all died on the jour∣ney. The bishop elect obtained the king's licence for visiting Rome; but, coming to Dover, was prohibited leaving the kingdom by Bertram de Greol, the con∣stable there; from whence, despairing of a passport on this business, he returned to Durham, and voluntarily renounced his election. On hearing this matter, the king sent messengers to Durham, to except against certain persons, thought most likely to be chosen by the convent, and to propose <HI>Peter de Egroblanch,</HI> a kinsinan of his majesty's, whom they rejected<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robert de Graystanes.—Ang. Sac. p. 736.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>During this period the king presented Robert de Courtney to the deanry of Auckland<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tanner's Not.</NOTE>; and a bull was obtained from the See of Rome, commanding the prior and monks not to attempt any thing during the vacancy of the See, to the prejudice of the king<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rymer's Toedra, v. i. p. 388.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thomas de Melsonby was elected prior on the Ist day of June 1237, and resigned on the 8th of April 1240. On the 2d day of January 1241, the convent proceeded to the election of NICHOLAS DE FARNHAM, the queen's physician, a man unexceptionable at court, and to whose election the king was instantly reconciled. He received the temporalities in the month of Fe∣bruary, and was consecrated at Gloucester, on the day of the Holy Trinity, by Walter Gray archbishop of York, the king and queen, with many of the prelates and nobility, being present at the ceremony, and was enthroned at Durham on the feast of St Cuthbert's Translation. He had studied pharmacy, natural phi∣losophy,
<PB N="206" REF="253"/>and logic, many years, in which he made great proficiency; and after∣wards, turning his attention to theology, arrived at great excellence therein. From his learning, extensive knowledge, and exemplary manners, he became not only physician to the royal personages, but their spiritual and privy counsellor. In this situation he received advice of his election to the See of Durham, which he refused to take, lest the world shold reproach him for not accepting the bishop∣ric of Coventry, which was offered to him some time before, being a poor See, and now receiving the opulent bishopric of Durham. The bishop of Lincoln, Robert Grosthead, took great pains to dissuade him from his determination, re∣presenting the duty of filling this important trust, lest the king should obtrude some unworthy person, of principles improper to have the government of the strong places of the bishopric, which were esteemed the bulwarks of England against the Scots, to the great hazard of the realm. These powerful arguments prevailed with this learned and excellent prelate to shake off his scruples, and ac∣cept of the episcopal dignity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rob. de Graystanes.—Mon Angl. v. iii. p. 148.—Lel. Col. v. iii.—Ang. Sac. p. 737.—M. Paris, p. 541, 519, 573, 628, 759.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>He did not hold this See long; for, having obtained licence from the pope, in the beginning of February 1249, he resigned, the convent accepting the instru∣ment of resignation on the eighth day of February. He had assigned to him, for his support in retirement, the manors of Hoveden, Stockton, and Easington, said to produce 1000 marks a-year. This reservation, the succeeding bishop, with the convent, struggled much to have reversed, and for that purpose appealed to Rome in the year 1250, but received a disgraceful repulse. Before the bishop's resigna∣tion, it was alledged against him, that he was married at the time of his consecra∣tion, but thereupon repudiated a worthy wife<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Annal. Lanercost.</NOTE>. The truth of this imputation is not made out against him. He resided much at Stockton, and there departed this life in the year 1257. He is described as being of an elegant form and stature, a modest countenance and gesture, an affable demeanour, and of a grave but per∣suasive elocution. He was interred at Durham.</P>
<P>During this prelate's time, prior Thomas made several repairs in the church, and covered it with a new roof, the bishop not only assenting thereto, but also giv∣ing, in aid of the work, the church of Bedlington. He also gave to the convent 100 acres of woodland, called Milneside, with power to enclose it, and granted them free warren therein, and also in the parks of Aickliff, Ferry, Rainton, and Heworth.</P>
<P>At the congress of York, the king of Scotland renewed his demand of the ces∣sion of the northern counties, imputing several desalcations, in matters formerly stipulated between the crowns, to the part of the king of England. Otho, the pope's legate, was present, and to his intermediation the agreement which succeed∣ed was in some manner to be imputed. The king of Scotland consented to receive lands of 200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> yearly value, to be assigned in some of the northern counties, in composition for his claim, to be held by him and his heirs of the crown of Eng∣land, on the service of rendering a falcon yearly to the hands of the constable of
<PB N="207" REF="254"/>the castle of Carlisle. The bishop was commissioned by the king to assign the lands stipulated in this convention, which were Penrith and Sowerby in Cumber∣land, as appears from the account in Ryley of the seisin of those places, ordered to be given by Edw. 1. in the 21st parliament of his reign, to John Baliol, as heir of the then late king of Scotland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer's Foedra, v. i. p. 400.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There being a parliament summoned at London in the 28th year of the king's reign A. D. 1244, and all the bishops being required by Martin, the pope's legate, to repair thither, touching an aid to the king and pope, the king thereupon, fear∣ing some designs from Scotland, commanded the bishop of Durham, notwithstand∣ing his former summons, to remain at home, for the defence of those parts, till far∣ther order<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prynn. v. ii. p. 63<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. Soon after, in the same year, the king led a great army to New∣castle, which Fordun describes to have embodied in it 5000 horsemen, completely and finely armed. The king of Scotland was not behind in preparations, and came to Ponteland with his troops, consisting of 100,000 foot, and 1000 horse∣men, well mounted, and defended with iron armour, or coats of mail of network. These mighty preparations ended in a treaty, in which the king of Scotland did ho∣mage to king Henry, and agreed not to enter into league with his enemics, for ma∣king war on his dominions, without some previous injury, injustice, or oppression.</P>
<P>As the king of England approached Durham in his route, Thomas the prior, fearful of his wrath for the opposition maintained in his election to the See, and well knowing the king's resentful, though weak and fluctuating mind, resigned the office of prior, and retired to the island of Farne, first the retreat of St Cuth∣bert, and then occupied by a hermit named Bartholemew, where he spent the re∣mainder of his life in religious austerities, giving frequent alms, and exhorting those who resorted to him, with great piety and fervour, to the exercise of virtue, self-denial, and sanctity of manners. He was brought to Durham to be interred. Bertram de Middleton succeeded him in the office of prior<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rob. de Graystanes.— Any. Sac. p. 737.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the year 1248, the bishop, presuming upon the privileges of his palatinate, oppressed the prior of Tynemouth, contrary to the liberties granted to that priory by the king's royal predecessors, and the laws of the realm; and, upon two let∣ters sent by the king, in which he intreated him in a friendly manner to desist from such injurious acts, as the priory was under his special protection, he neglected or refused to refrain from such measures; on which the king, by virtue of his royal prerogative, sent him his special writ or mandate, commanding him to do imme∣diate justice to the prior, or he would do him justice himself, notwithstanding his liberties, and also punish the injuries he had already committed<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Prynn, v. ii. p. 716.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the king's objections to Thomas of Melsonby, and during the episcopacy of bishop Farnham, more particular mention is made of the importance of this pa∣latinate to the state, than occurs before in history. The fortresses of the See are described as the bulwarks of the nation against the Scots; and this barrier esteem∣ed of so much consequence to the tranquillity of the realm, as to require a direct dispensation to be granted to the bishop from serving the high duties of parliament,
<PB N="208" REF="255"/>in order that he might attend to the important trust of defending his province from the threatened attacks of the enemy. The maritime parts of the province are spoken of as capable of receiving foreign troops, and being of much significance, should they be employed in support of the Scots, by receiving men from France and Flanders. The wealth and populousness of the See were encreasing rapidly, and the importance of the palatinate to the realm every day advancing.</P>
<P>During bishop Farnham's time, the king, as patron of the bishopric of Dur∣ham, and supreme governor of the church of England, sent two special writs in∣to this jurisdiction, the one to exempt this prelate from the payment of his pre∣decessors debts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prynn, v. ii. p. 728.</NOTE>, the other to enable him to make a will, and thereby dispose of the goods which he had in right of his church, without interruption of the officers of the crown, which otherwise he could not have done<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 101.</NOTE>. In 1249 he resigned the bishopric; and, retiring to Stockton, died there in February 1257, having lived a private life the space of eight years, and was buried among his predecessors in the chapter-house at Durham<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The See vacant.—William Grat, high sheriff.— Grey's MSS.

<P>The See continued vacant a very short time after the resignation of bishop Farn∣ham: The king speedily granted his licence for electing a prelate, but at the same time importuned the convent to nominate <HI>Ethelmar,</HI> his half brother; whom they refused, on account of his youth and want of learning; whereupon, it is said<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Mat. Paris.</NOTE>, the king threatened to keep the See vacant till he was esteemed of a fit age. Notwithstanding this menace, on the 21st day of April 1249, the convent elected WALTER DE KIRKHAM dean of York, who being approved, received the temporalities of the See, and was consecrated at York by archbishop Gray on the 5th day of December follow∣ing.</P>
<P>The bishop, soon after coming to the See, confirmed to the convent the grants and donations of his predecessors. He gave the church of Branksto for the sup∣port
<PB N="209" REF="256"/>of two monks at Warkworth, supposed to be appointed to do duty at the beautiful hermitage near that place, one of the sweetest retirements in the north of England, and perhaps the most elegant cavern in the known world, hewn out of the bosom of a rock. He appropriated the church of Heighington to the convent, after the death or cession of William de Kirkenny, then vicar thereof, for the bet∣ter support of their hospitality, and the entertainment of pilgrims and poor per∣sons. He also granted to them Horselyhope, near Muggleswic, containing 216 <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cres of woodland and waste, with licence to inclose the same<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rob. de Graystanes.— Ang. Sac. p. 738.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The oppressions of the See of Rome had occasioned some remarkable exertions of the English barons. They compelled the insolent and tyrannical legate, Mar∣tin, to quit the realm, A. D. 1245. They denied, by public ambassadors, before the council of Lyons, where the pope was present, king John's right, without the consent of his parliament, to make his crown tributary. They absolutely rejected the <HI>non obstante</HI> clause in the pope's bull, by which he presumed to dispose of bene∣fices, "notwithstanding the right of patronage, or other privilege to the contrary," which in its operation was a total annihilation of the rights and liberties of the church. In the following year a memorial was signed by the king, bishops, and temporal lords, touching the grievances this country was oppressed with by the holy See; but the haughty spirit of the chief pontiff was so far from relaxing, that new exactions were imposed on the clergy. This encreased the wrath which already had agitated the minds of the resentful barons; and, under their influ∣ence, the king, in defiance of the threatened powers of an interdict and excom∣munication, forbade obedience to the pope's mandate; and the affair, by this hardy opposition, totally subsided. The See of Rome did not, from this instance, desist from new attempts, or refrain devising measures for extorting money. Pre∣tending a right of disposing of the dominions of Sicily and Apula, and knowing well the weakness of the king of England, his vanity, and extravagance, the pope made a formal grant of those territories, in the year 1255, to Edmund the king's son; in consideration of which, the bishop of Hereford agreed, on behalf of the religious houses in England, that the ecclesiastics of the realm should pay 38,000 marks<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Bertram the prior of Durham, with his convent, protested against this exorbitant exaction, which was founded on the most ridiculous pre∣text invention could have devised, too shallow to ensnare any but a prince of Hen∣ry's capacity. The method proposed to obtain this was as extraordinary as the grounds on which it was projected. He caused a number of obligatory notes to be drawn, whereby each bishop, abbot, or prior, in England, acknowledged to have received of some merchant of Sienna, or other place in Italy, the sum of '*** for the occasions of his church, and bound himself to pay it at a day ap∣pointed. This was protested against, in a violent manner, by most of the dignified clergy; but at a succeeding convention, where the pope's nuncio still insisted on compliance, he alledged, <Q>there was no injustice in what the pope claimed, since, as all churches belonged to him, he could dispose of their incomes as he plea∣sed.”</Q>
<PB N="210" REF="257"/>This extraordinary pretension was answered by Leonard, the deputy or prolocutor for the clergy on this occasion, who said, <Q>all churches might be said “in some sense to belong to the pope; but it was only in order that he should protect and defend them, and not appropriate them to his own use. In like manner, continued he, we say in England, all things are the king's; yet no man ever imagined the king was proprietor of all the estates of his subjects; so, with regard to the lands of the church, it can never be proved, that it was ”the intention of the founders to give them to the pope.</Q> M. Paris sets forth the pope's bull for this exaction, which shews that nothing was done in the busi∣ness of the notes but by his express authority. It concludes in these words: <Q>“You shall take care to let the king know, that all this is our will and pleasure; wherefore I set down in these presents what each abbot and prior shall be bound to pay: The prior and monastery of Durham, 500 marks; of Bath, 400; Thorney, 400; &amp;c. Dated at Anagnia the x of the kalends of July, in the ”2d year of our pontificate.</Q></P>
<P>Soon after the above matter subsided, the prior of Durham resigned his office, 15th August 1258, and had assigned him for maintenance the churches of Pittington, Heighington, and some other places; and Hugh de Derlington, the sub-prior, was elected in his room, 16th August 1258.</P>
<P>The unhappy dissentions still prevailing in Scotland between K. Alex. III. and one party of his nobles, the queen-dowager of Scotland, who had married John de Acre, son to the king of Jerusalem, on a visit to the Scottish court, became mediator for a reconciliation and coalition of parties. The king of England, be∣ing then engaged in a campaign against the Welch, deputed the archbishop of York, the bishop of Durham, Richard de Quincy earl of Winchester, Bertram prior of Durham, John Maunsel provost of Beverley, Gilberton de Preston, and William Latimer, with powers to conclude, in conjunction with the king of Scot∣land's council, such matters as they judged were consistent with the honour of the two states. For this purpose they met at Stirling, without forming any effective plan. In less than two months the earl of Monteith seized the king in bed at Kin∣ross, under pretence of rescuing him from the hands of persons excommunicated. The king of England at the time of this event was waging war with the Welch; and the chiefs of the Scottish faction entered into a treaty of alliance with them against England; which occasioned those persons who were in the opposite party to fly for protection to Henry's court.</P>
<P>The summer of the year 1258 proved excessively turbulent in England. Simon de Montford earl of Leicester, offended at the king's partiality to his brothers by the mother's side, as well as other foreigners, entered into a combination to expel them the kingdom. Not contented with having effected his purpose, but seeing the king's party greatly weakened, as well by this measure as the defection of ma∣ny whom he had treated with levity and disrespect, the confederates established a council, to whom, after many struggles, they compelled the king to commit the direction of all public affairs, that the many grievances of the people might be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edressed; and this ju<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to required the king's subjects in general to swear to an ob∣servance
<PB N="211" REF="258"/>of the regulations then established, which were afterwards known by the name of the <HI>Oxford Provisions.</HI> This new system of government was formed in June, in a parliament held at Oxford, which, from their extravagant projects and measures, was stiled the <HI>Mad Parliament.</HI> The contemptible figure the king of England made in this situation, no doubt reduced his consequence with the court of Scot∣land. The prevailing party there had seen him under the most despicable light; in one moment, with the most solemn asseverations, protesting to his assembled states, that he would observe and keep inviolate his father's charters, and in the n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xt, in contempt of the most horrid anathema, projecting and executing mea∣sures totally adverse. They had seen him the dupe of the See of Rome, draining his kingdom of its wealth, for the maintenance of a visionary title to the crown of Sicily, given to his son Edmund by the magical power of that See: And whilst the king of England was thus lavishly pouring out his treasures, Manfrid was suffered to wear the crown of that state in quiet, without the pope's using any ef∣forts to depose him. They saw Richard, the king's other brother, adding to the calamities of the people by draining the state of 700,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> sterling, a vast sum in those days, to support the title of king of the Romans: And now they beheld the government reposed in the hands of a junto, at whose head was placed the im∣petuous earl of Leicester. Under those circumstances an attempt was made by the regents to conciliate the minds of the Scottish partizans; for which purpose several of the English nobles met the king at Melros. What project the English had formed, historians have not declared with precision; but certain it is a consi∣derable body of forces was drawn down to the borders. Norham and Wark Castles were put under the government of Robert de Nevil lord of Raby, who had instructions to have provision of horse and arms in readiness for a secret ex∣pedition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Neville, in the following year, was also made governor of the Castle of Bambrough. —Dugd.

The king of Scotland and his council had entertained some appre∣hension of a plot to seize the king and carry him into England; in consequence of which surmise the English commissioners were required to attend at Jedburgh, where they were astonished to find the forest lined with troops, and a complete cir∣cumvallation formed to protect their sovereign. This discovery prevented the ex∣ecution of the project, if any such was really devised, and brought on earnest en∣deavours to effect a reconciliation, and obtain a peace, which accordingly ensued.</P>
<P>In this prelate's time the mintage was revived; and Mr Noble's words are, <Q>It “now remains to shew when, and for what reasons, the prelates were permitted to use any peculiar marks to distinguish their coin from the royal money.

From hence, therefore, it might be found neces∣sary to permit such of the prelates as enjoyed a mint to distinguish, by some pe∣culiar device, the episcopal from the royal coins; as otherwise it would have been impossible to punish the mint-masters for any forgeries they might commit, from the difficulty there might have been in identifying whether such of them who debased or counterfeited the money were servants to the king or the bishop, and by that means leave an opening for many frauds. This was the more ne∣cessary, as there were royal and episcopal mints in the city of Durham as late at least as the reign of K. Edw. III. This custom, however, was continued af∣ter the cause had ceased, for we have some distinctions upon all the Durham money from that prince's reign down to the abolition of their mint. The only probable reason for this is, the desire the episcopal palatines had of acquaint∣ing posterity, that they enjoyed this sovereign privilege; and this they have ef∣fectually done; for, though they could not in any great degree differ in their
<PB N="213" REF="260"/>types from those used by their sovereign, yet, as they were permitted to have some variations, the former bishops have either placed their arms, or some other inferior device, upon their money; and the latter have generally the initial of one or both the names of the prelates who caused them to be struck; and so very careful have they been of distinguishing their own money from that of their predecessors, that we hope to fix the money of each to the prelate by ”whose authority it was fabricated.</Q></P>
<P>In the year 1255, some servants of John Baliol being excommunicated, and imprisoned upon a <HI>capias excommunicatum,</HI> by the bishop of Durham, for entering forcibly into the church of Long-Newton, Eustace de Baliol, Goceline de Baliol, and others of John's people, in revenge, lay in ambush in a wood near which the bishop was about to pass, assaulted him and his men with horse and arms, treating the bishop very irreverently, and taking four of his attendants prisoners, whom they confined in the Castle of Barnard till the bishop should liberate the excom∣municated persons. Upon the bishop's complaint of this insult to the king, he issued his writ, rehearsing the several circumstances, and stating, that the assault was a flagrant breach of the king's peace which the bishop had in his royal fran∣chise and liberty between Tyne and Tees, and thereby commanding J. Baliol, Eustace Baliol, and the constable of the Castle of Barnard, to liberate the persons so held in confinement. It appears that the bishop held his authority with an illegal rigour; for he refused to deliver the excommunicated persons to bail, as the law re∣quired, which obliged the parties to apply to the king for his writ <HI>de cautione ad∣mittenda,</HI> in order to their being received to bail<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Claus. 39th Hen.

<P>Immediately after the death of bishop Kirkham, on the 30th day of September succeeding, a new prelate was elected.</P>
<P>ROBERT DE STICHILL, then prior of Finchale, (who took his name probably from Stichehille, a place on the north borders, near the hills of Cheviot) was nominated by the convent: He was confirmed by Godfride archbishop of York on the day of St Clement, being the 23d of November 1260. He received restitution of the temporalities from the king on the 5th day of December, and was consecrated by the same archbishop at Southwell, on the 13th day of February 1261. He was bred a monk in the monastery of Durham, where, in his youth, he discovered much levity of tem∣per, for which he underwent some instances of disgrace. Impelled by shame, or the violence of his disposition, he formed a resolution to quit the monastic disci∣pline, and fly by night from the cloister; but he was stayed by a mental remorse,
<PB N="215" REF="262"/>or other secret influence, from so rash a determination, his heart being enlivened with hopes of advancement, in future life, in the ecclesiastical character<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rob. de Graystanes.—Ang. Sac. p. 739.</NOTE>. The monkish writers give this determination a cast of miraculous interposition; but let the incitement be what it would, the consequence was excellent: He gave a check to his temper and puerile levitie, applied himself strictly to his studies, became a religious observer of his duty, and attained such proficiency, both in religious con∣duct and divine learning, as to gain the approbation of the whole society. He was the son of a priest, and, by the canons, deprived of ecclesiastical preferment; but his growing virtues so ingratiated him into the favour of those who knew him, particularly Henry de Horncastre, afterwards prior of Coldingham, a man of great knowledge in temporal as well as spiritual concerns, that, unknown to him, he obtained a dispensation by which he ascended to his dignities in the church. He was for several years prior of Finchale, which office he filled with great propriety of character. Soon after his consecration, he gave to the convent 1300 acres of woodland, the better to enable them to proceed in their religious edifices. After some altercation between him and the convent, he obliged the monks, as soon as they had professed before the prior, to do the same before him, and receive his solemn benediction. After the resignation of prior Hugh, in the year 1272, he took the custody of the church and convent, during the vacancy of the office of prior; and an unhappy disagreement prevailed for some time touching formalities requisite in the election, the bishop insisting on his being stiled <HI>patron and supreme;</HI> alledging, if he was not patron, there was no necessity for them to require his consent for electing their prior.</P>
<P>He joined with the prior and convent in making the church of Hoveden colle∣giate.</P>
<P>The distresses of the state, soon after our bishop's accession, grew to a great height. The king, supported by the papal authority in his most extravagant pur∣poses, now exhibited a bull, under which he and his subjects had a dispensation from their oath of observance of the Oxford Provisions. Simon de Montford earl of Leicester had shewn principles tending, as it was conjectured, to lead him to the throne: He assumed the chief authority, and presumed to act without the council or concurrence of the rest of his associates. This soon severed the earl of Gloucester from his interest; he went over to the king, who, under the influence of the pope's dispensation, rejected the administration of the select council, and resumed the reins of government. The king maintained his authority with great difficulty for about two years, in which time he lost the support of the earl of Gloucester and several others of his most powerful and sage adherents, who were taken off by death. The earl of Leicester was not only a skilful politician, but also a most assiduous person in such affairs as he engaged in. With every exertion he strove, under the present conjuncture, to encrease his party, and strengthen his influence; till at length a favourable time appeared for him to declare open war against the king, who was extending his prerogative in every instance, to the hazard
<PB N="216" REF="263"/>of the liberty of the people. Immediately on the insurrection of the barons, with Leicester at their head, the king appointed Robert de Neville captain-general of all his forces north of Trent, sheriff of Yorkshire, and governor of the Castle of York. After Neville's acceptance of this great trust, he wrote to the king's chancellor to request, that sufficient funds might be formed for executing the charge he had assumed, as well as the maintenance of the Castle of Bambrough, which he also then held; to enforce which request, he reported the intelligence he had received of a descent having been made on the northern parts of Scotland, by the kings of Denmark and Norway, with a powerful fleet; and as their in∣tention was not fully known, there was reason to doubt the district entrusted to his care was in some jeopardy. He also wrote to the king, requesting his royal mandate to the lords Robert de Brus, John Comyn, John Baliol, and Hugh Percy, and his other great barons in the north, commanding them to be aiding in the preservation of peace in the country under his superintendency. The king of Scot∣land interposed, and exerted his influence to bring about a reconciliation between the king and his barons; but in vain; the invaders, by a fatal battle, and succeed∣ing storm at sea, being totally discomfited, and their disheartened remains having retired from the country, he was at leisure to assist the king of England; and we find the powerful barons above named, who had possessions in both kingdoms, led a large body of Scots auxiliaries southward for that purpose. They were with the king at the battle of Northampton, where his party prevailed; but the success of that day was soon reversed by the fatal field of Lewes in Sussex, A. D. 1264, where the king, his brother Richard king of Jerusalem, and his gallant son Ed∣ward, were all made prisoners, and their army totally routed. Cumin, Brus, and Baliol, were among the prisoners, and almost all the body of troops they led from Scotland were cut off<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. Paris.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Montford now assumed the supreme power, which he held above a year, go∣verning under the specious character of minister, whilst he had the king in his power, compelling him to put his hand and seal to every instrument he chose to issue. During this period the bishop and prior of Durham were summoned to the parliament held under his influence, A. D. 1264<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rymer's Foedera, v. i. p. 802.

<P>Little merit is to be attributed to the king in the series of successes which suc∣ceeded this victory; the great military skill and political powers of the king of Je∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>alem, with the alacrity, fortitude, and valour of prince Edward, chiefly con∣tributed to the fortunate events which ensued. The earl of Leicester's sons, and others of his accomplices, who escaped the slaughter of Evesham field, in mere despair and disappointed rage, made several vigorous efforts to support their sink∣ing cause, in different parts of the kingdom, which, to delude the people, and palliate their crime, they every where declared was not in opposition to the king's right of ruling, but for the redress of national grievances, and to remove arbi∣trary and oppressive principles, which had crept into government contrary to the constitution, and liberty of the subject: But, notwithstanding the speciousness of the pretext, all parties in the rebellion were soon subdued by the prowess and wife conduct of prince Edward, which every where prevailed. The northern barons who were in Leicester's party, were last of being reduced, they having been treated with great rigour, in the confiscation of their property and forfeiture of their lands, and thence driven to despair. At their head was John de Vesey lord of Alnwick. On submitting to the prince's clemency, the forfeitures were re∣laxed, and their property put under a fine.</P>
<P>The earl of Leicester, or Peter de Montford his son, was possessed of the manor of Greatham, within the palatinate of Durham, which by this rebellion became forfeited. The king immediately seized the same, believing, as he sets forth in his grant after mentioned, that such forfeitures belonged to his crown within the liberties of Durham, equally with those lying out of that jurisdiction; and he gave it to his favourite Thomas de Clare. The bishop profecuted his claim for this for∣feited manor, as being the right of his See, where, under the <HI>jura regalia</HI> of his palatinate, he had a just title to all such forfeited lands, and other things, as the king had in right of his crown in other parts of his realm. And the same being brought before the king's council, the king, by his letters patent to the bishop, setting forth, that at the instance of him, and others his faithful subjects, and by the information of his council, he was given to understand, that he could not make such grant, <HI>without doing wrong to the bishop and his church, and injuring the aforesaid liberty,</HI> in which he had <HI>jura regalia;</HI> and being induced at come to do strict justice, and restore to the bishop his right, he revoked the grant to Clare, and for him and his heirs willed and granted, that the bishop should do his plea∣sure within the said mannor, and others the lands and tenements within his rega∣lity, forfeited, and to him escheated, as the king did with other lands forfeited to his crown; declaring, that such before mentioned grant to Clare should not be made a precedent, or the bishop, or his successors, or their liberty, should be in any wife prejudiced thereby in future. Those letters patent are dated from Strat∣ford

By the rehearsals in the before mentioned royal letters patent, it is shewn, that Greatham was the estate of Peter de Montford; and such authority is preferable to the assertions of some authors, who say the forfeiture was derived from Simon earl of Leicester. It appears that the bishop, to secure the title, purchased the claim of Peter de Montford, the son of Peter, which he confirmed by his grant. But what seems most singular is, that, in the deed of foundation of the hospital after mentioned, the bishop doth not set forth, that he came to the manor by forfeiture, but by the grant of Peter, <Q><HI>Ex dono specialis amici nostri domini Petri de Monteforti ad divini “”numinis cultum augmentandum,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which tends to depreciate the dignity of the palatinate. If there was any legal doubt of the bishop's not being fully invested with <HI>jura regalia</HI> within the wapentake of Sadberge, in which Greatham lies, then, to cure the defect, the grant from Peter the grandson was a judicious measure; and it seems as if some such doubt had then arisen. The bishop being quieted in this possession, founded an hospital at Greatham, which he dedicated to God, the blessed Mary, and St Cuthbert, wherein he placed a master, five priests, two clerks, and forty indigent people; and, for the maintenance thereof, granted the manor, with its appendages, together with the advowson of the church, which he exempted from all charges. He also published an indulgence of forty days to such as should contribute thereto.

<P>All matters being settled towards a re-establishment of domestic peace in Eng∣land, prince Edward set out upon a crusade in the year 1270, but, before his re∣turn, received intelligence of the death of the king his father, who had enjoyed four years repose after the suppression of so formidable a rebellion; and during that time his subjects, under the prudent administration of those who brought about the happy reverse of the king's estate, enjoyed their liberties in peace. The king departed this life at St Edmundsbury, on the 16th day of November 1272, in the 64th year of his age, and 56th of his reign. So much has occurred in the preceding pages to distinguish this prince's character, that it is needless to repeat any of those striking traits which have already appeared.</P>
<P>A manuscript, said to be found in lord Coniers's study, sets forth the names of ma∣ny knights of the bishopric of Durham, between Tyne and Tees, at the battle of Lewes; but, unfortunately, it is not said on whose side they were, though, from circumstances, it is probable they were for the king, and principally, that the for∣feiture of Peter Montford, before mentioned, is the only one recorded. John Ba∣liol and Robert Brus were prisoners in that battle, and neither their names, or the name of Peter de Montfort are in this list. But be it true or false as to the occa∣sion, it is curious, as comprehending the names and places of residence of the chief men of that time<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">In bishop Pudsey's survey book, called the Boldon Buke, deposited in the auditor's office in Durham, as an additional entry, we find the list of knights in 1264 thus set forth (p. 135.).

<P>The bishop survived his sovereign two years. The pope convened a council at Lyons, in the month of May 1274, at which the bishop was present; but, on his return, being seized with a mortal disease, he died at the Castle of Arby∣peyllis, on the 4th of August, and was interred in a monastery of the Benedictine order, near that place: His heart was sent to Durham, and deposited in the chap∣ter-house, among his predecessors. He appears to have steered clear of all the troubles of the reign of Henry III. After the few formalities of his prerogative were settled, he lived in cordiality with the convent, and joined in their religious works. The foundation of Greatham Hospital shews his piety, and moderation as to riches; as he did not suffer that great possession to encrease the revenues of the See<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel.

<P>In this bishop's time the prior added a large belfry to the church at Durham, improved the organ, emparked the lands of Beaurepaire, or Bearpark, and Mug∣gleswick, and erected at the latter place a camera, or lodge; also one at Warde∣law, with a hall and chapel, which were afterwards destroyed upon an incursion of the Scots.</P>
<P>In the year 1272 prior Hugh resigned his office; and Richard de Claxton, then prior of Holy Island, succeeded him.</P>
<P>It was almost two years after the death of the king before prince Edward arrived in England. He ascended the throne with the universal esteem and approbation of his people, his early life having exhibited so much heroic virtue and magnani∣mity of soul. He and his queen were crowned on the 9th day of August 1274.</P>
<P>Before Edward's arrival in England, pope Gregory sent his nuncio to compel the payment of two years dismes by the ecclesiastics, out of their temporal effects and ecclesiastical benefices, for the use of the king and his brother, as he alledged; but, in truth, the same was destined as a prey to the See of Rome<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Westm.—Prynn, v. iii. p. 133, 134.</NOTE>. Several of the ecclesiastical bodies refused to comply, notwithstanding the threatened thun∣ders of excommunication. The nuncio applied by letter to the king's chancellor, for his mandate to the sheriffs to levy the same; whereupon he issued his writ to the guardians of the bishopric of Durham, the See being vacant; John de Lovetot and Jeffrey de Newbald then had custody thereof, by virtue of the king's writ. The executors of bishop Stichill, having put in pledges to fatisfy all debts owing to the king, he issued his writ to the before-named guardians, for free administra∣tion of his goods, and reaping the corn he had sown<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The king's coronation happening during the vacancy of the See, and the king of Scotland and his queen being summoned to attend that ceremony, they were entitled to the stipulated allowance from the bishopric of Durham, for the expences of their journey, which amounted to 175 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and was paid, by the king's receivers, out of the revenues of the See, after the rate of 100 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> <HI>per diem</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rymer's Fed. v. ii. p. 42.—M.

<P>A licence was obtained from the king to elect a prelate; and, on the 24th of September 1274, ROBERT DE INSULA, (alias Halieland), then prior of Finchale, was chosen bishop of this See. Robert de Graystanes says, he was examined, and his election enquired of, by Walter
<PB N="224" REF="271"/>Giffard archbishop of York, at Ripon, on the 21st day of October, when a day was assigned for his confirmation, being the vigil of All Saints, in the church at Durham. This is the first instance that has occurred, in our church historians, of the ceremony of examination of the bishop of Durham, previous to confirmation. The temporalities were restored to him by the king's writ, dated the eleventh day of November; and he was consecrated at York, by the same archbishop, on the ninth day of December following<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rex militibus, liberis hominibus, &amp; omnibus aliis tenentibus de epat'u Dunelm. salutem.

<P>On the day previous to that assigned for the bishop's confirmation, the arch∣bishop commenced the duty of visitor of the convent of Durham; which after∣wards occasioned much controversy, to the great disgrace of religion: To which succeeded various acts of authority, which he was studious of usurping, and with great assiduity attempted to establish. A relation of the various circumstances would be tedious and disinteresting; and the inquisitive may find an account of them in Graystanes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rob. de Graystanes.—Ang. Sac. p. 743.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The bishop held a synod in his diocese, in the fifth year of the king's reign; and, by virtue of his episcopal authority, compiled and published sundry constitutions, concerning the payment of tithes and mortuaries, and denounced a solemn excom∣munication against those who should obstruct the performance thereof<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">A Spelmanni concilia, tom. ii. p. 316 to 320.—Prynn, v. iii. p. 193. "All their constitutions, synods, and sentences of excommunication, tending principally to advance their own episcopal constitutions, canons, jurisdictions, privileges, church liberties, usurpations on the king's royal prerogative, ecclesiastical and tem∣poral jurisdiction, and his lay subjects' rights, properties, franchises; not God's true worship, honour, ser∣vice, or salvation of the people's souls, which they seldom really minded, or publicly promoted in their sy∣nods in this age, or long before it." Such are the words of this warm party writer.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The king, after his parliament and convocation held at Northampton, in the eleventh year of his reign, issued his precepts to the archbishop of York and bishop of Durham, to grant him a competent aid of money for his expedition against Wales; and appointed Thomas de Mandeville, and Hen. de Newark archdeacon of Richmond, to demand and receive the same in this province<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Rot. Walliae 2 Edw. I. m. 4.—Prynn, v. iii. p. 302.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The year succeeding Edward's coronation proved fatal to the queen of Scotland; on whose death the amicable principles, which had long been maintained between the two kingdoms, were much infringed, and the borderers began to renew their acts of violence, which occasioned the king of Scotland, in the following year, to complain of the excesses committed by the officers of the crown of England on the
<PB N="225" REF="272"/>marches<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, v. ii. p. 1064, &amp;c.</NOTE>; on which errand envoys were sent from the court of Scotland. On the other hand, the bishop of Durham complained to the king of encroachments made in his territory; on which Edward sent letters to the Scottish court, admo∣nishing the king not to attempt extending his march beyond the established limits<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 86.</NOTE>, as he wished to maintain the peace which then subsisted between the states. To refute this complaint, the king of Scotland sent ambassadors to Edward, viz. the bishops of St Andrew's and Dumblane, Robert de Brus earl of Carrick, and Rich∣ard de Stratun, who avouched, in the name of their sovereign, that no encroach∣ments had been made on the possessions of the bishopric; but, in order to an ami∣cable adjustment, proposed that the charge should be referred to men of knowledge, chosen by each party, agreeable to the laws of the march; and added, they were commanded by the king their master to request him, as a brother and ally, not to give ear to any person who sought to disturb him in his rights and possessions, which he and his ancestors had so long enjoyed.</P>
<P>Alexander king of Scotland did his homage to the king of England, in the pre∣sence of the English parliament, at the palace of Westminster; and the matter in dispute between him and the bishop was brought before the same parliament, and afterwards heard, by Edward and his council, in the presence of delegates assigned by the king of Scotland for that purpose, when some articles were agreed on for terminating that suit. But, in order to a final determination, the presence of pro∣per parties was necessary upon the ground in question, to judge with precision on the nature of the bishop's complaint: To this end the king appointed the bishop of Norwich, John de Vesey, Rob. de Scardeburg, and Thomas de Normanville, to repair to places in Northumberland contiguous to the disputed lands, and there hear, reform, and terminate the matter, according to what was concluded and agreed in the English parliament and council, and as to their own discretion should seem just. The commission also commands the sheriff of Northumberland to cause such knights to attend them, at the times and places they should appoint, as might be necessary for the better discovery of the truth in this matter<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 130.</NOTE>. For∣dun mentions the sheriff of Newcastle as one attending in this commission. The commissioners came to Tweed-mouth, accompanied by the bishop of Durham, where they were met by the bishops of St Andrew's, Glasgow, and Dumblane, to∣gether with several nobles and earls of Scotland, who came to treat of the matter. But the king of England's commission not giving liberty for any negociation, but being a positive power to determine singly, it is probable the Scots would remon∣strate against so arbitrary a mode, which implied an entire sovereignty in the king of England; and, indeed, it appears evident that king Edward was then conceiv∣ing a plan of that tendency, to which he was encouraged by his successes against Wales. This conjecture is supported by the instructions<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> to the bishop of Nor∣wich, to make diligent enquiry concerning the homage of king Alexander's pre∣decessors, and all circumstances relative to it, in the most cautious and secret man∣ner he could; but to take no steps about it, without a special order from the king.

<P>In the period of time during which the bishop presided in this See, Edward, after putting in execution many salutary measures for reforming the abuses which had taken place in government, and sending forth trusty officers to dispense impartial justice, and punish breaches of the law, he employed his attention principally against Wales; in the event reducing that state to due submission: To this pur∣pose he issued his mandate to the bishops, to send their quota of men into the field<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edvardus D.

<P>The chief glory of this part of Edward's reign was the salutary statute of Mort∣main, whereby all persons were forbid to dispose of their estates to societies which never die, without the king's express consent. The See of Durham, among others, was affected thereby; but the diminution of a power which had already increased to an incredible height, as will be shewn in the succeeding prelate's life, and which threatened the state with little less than dissolution had it proceeded, was one of the wisest measures of this illustrious reign. The sovereign had a com∣petent apprehension of the danger impending over the state, if a speedy stop was not put to the enormous growth of church possessions. It was demonstrated to him, that, in process of time, all the lands of the kingdom would be in the hands of ecclesiastics, if people were still suffered to alienate their effects to the church, which, never dying, always acquiring, and never alienating, discovered, to com∣mon observation, a consequence of the most alarming nature; to remedy which
<PB N="227" REF="274"/>this statute was devised, and received by the people with infinite joy, whereby estates were prevented falling into hands, in a temporal sense, of no service to the king and the public. As perfection is not permitted to bless human life, the next remarkable statute of this reign had its evil consequences, though founded on just and noble principles, called the statute of <HI>Quo warranto,</HI> which enabled the crown to enquire into the exercise of franchises and the possession of estates, where the ostensible party was suspected of injurious usurpation. But this subject has no im∣mediate relation to the history of this province, in which is no record of our bi∣shop's exercise of the powers of that statute, or of the king's, till the time of the succeeding bishop. The reduction of Wales, and the extinction of the royal race of that principality, fully occupied the remaining part of the period of our prelate's life; an uninterrupted peace subsisting with Scotland.</P>
<P>The bishop appropriated the church of Middleham to Finchale priory, in aug∣mentation of six monks. He gave the advowson of the church of Meldon to the prior and convent of Durham, receiving in exchange the entire presentation to Waldenestow church, in Lincoln diocese, to which the bishop and prior used to present by turns. He granted to the prior and convent of Durham, free warren and woods in Billinghamshire. Having treated of more important matters, Graystanes descends to those less significant, and speaks of this bishop's great filial piety towards his mother; and also the aversion he had to drinking beer, which oc∣casions him to introduce the prelate's apology for his dislike, which, as expressive of his modesty of mind, may be repeated. Being sick with some beer served to him at Norham, "You see," says he, <Q>the consequence of habit: You know “from whence I am descended: I do not derive a love of wine from my ancestors ”or parents: Custom alone has habituated it to my constitution.</Q></P>

<P>During the vacancy the archbishop of York continued to persecute the convent with his visitorial pretensions, to the great scandal of his high office. On the 8th day of July, coming to Durham on the above-mentioned duty, and claiming to exercise a right of visitation, he was denied admittance to the cathedral church; on which he went to the church of St Nicholas, and was proceeding to pronounce an excommunication against the prior and convent, when a body of young men, belonging to the borough, opposed him in so clamorous and violent a manner, that they terrified the archbishop from his purpose, and put him in such bodily fear, that, escaping from the pulpit, he fled down the stairs which led to the schools with all possible privacy, and made the utmost expedition to the wa∣ter side, near Kypier. The ridiculous sigure the prelate made in his flight was much encreased by the populace having cut off one of the ears of his palfrey. The mob was so violent, that, if two persons of authority, Wynchard de Char∣ron, one of the king's commissioners and guardians of the See, and Peter de Thoresby, the temporal chancellor, had not interposed, it is probable the enraged populace would have put the prelate to death. The vicar of St Ofwald's (Elvet), attaching himself to the archbishop in this affair, was deprived, and never after restored. Much litigation ensued, on which the archbishop made a journey to Rome, and died there, which put an end to the unhappy business.</P>
<P>A licence having been obtained from the crown for the election of a bishop, ANTHONY BEK, <HI>alias</HI> BEAK, was nominated by the convent, a person in great favour at court, holding the office of secretary to the king.

He was chosen by the convent on the 9th day of July 1283; had the king's confirmation on the 28th of August; on the 4th of September he received restitution of the temporalities by the king's writ, and also possession of the corn, cattle, and essects of the pre∣ceding bishop, purchased by the crown of his executors, and now sold to bishop Bek<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Prynn, l. iii. p. 307.—Ang Sac. p. 745.</NOTE>; and he was consecrated, in the presence of the king and several of the
<PB N="229" REF="276"/>nobles, by William Wickwane archbishop of York, at St Peter's in York, on the 9th day of January following. In consequence of the dispute between the arch∣bishop and convent of Durham, the archbishop obliged the prior to go out of the church during the ceremony of consecration; and, the next day, enjoined the new bishop, upon his declaration of canonical obedience, to excommunicate the prior and heads of the convent; but he resused, saying, <Q>I was consecrated their “bishop yesterday, and shall I excommunicate them to-day?

But the bishop, unwilling to delay the solemnity of his installation on account of their dispute, and that preference might be given to nei∣ther party, the ceremony was performed by the bishop's brother, Thomas Bek bishop of St David's; and, in commemoration of the event, he presented, on the day of St John the Evangelist, two pieces of rich embroidery on stuff of gold, called Baudekyns, for the ornament of the high altar on the day of the Nativity, on which were wrought an historical representation of our Saviour's birth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rob. de Graystanes.—Ang.

<P>It is necessary to make a retrospection, touching some events which were previ∣ous to this prelate's election, duly to bring forward his public character in the state to the reader's attention. The royal family of Scotland had sustained a multitude of fatal shocks. Alexander III. in the first instance, lost his youngest son David; there then remaining to him his eldest son Alexander, and a daughter Margaret, who married Eric king of Norway, but, in less than two years, departed this life, leaving issue only one child, called after her mother. The prince royal of Scot∣land, soon after the marriage of his fister, espoused the daughter of the earl of Flanders, but died in the 20th year of his age; so that the royal race was now reduced to the infant princess of Norway. The king of Scotland, in hopes of further issue, married Julet daughter of the count de Dreux, a lady of great beauty and sine accomplishment: But the unhappy fatalities destined for this fa∣mily, were not yet compleated. In the ensuing spring the king was hilled by a sall from his horse near the town of Kinghorn, leaving no issue by his queen; on which event, Margaret, the infant princess of Norway, was declared by the lates next heir to the crown; and a regency was established accordingly. The king of England immediately conceived a design of uniting the kingdoms; to which end he proposed a marriage between his son Edward and the princess Mar∣garet, and he obtained the pope's dispensation, as they were within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity. It appears that the intended marriage was highly ac∣ceptable to the states of Scotland, who, whilst assembled at Brigham on Tweed, assented to the proposal by their letter to the king, signed by 12 bishops, 12 carls, 23 abbots, 11 priors, and 50 barons. All the regents were included in the num∣ber
<PB N="230" REF="277"/>of subscribers. To negociate this matter with Eric king of Norway, the bishop of Durham, with Henry de Newark dean of York, John earl Warren, and Robert bishop of Glasgow, were appointed by the king's commission, with powers to contract marriage between the parties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prynn, v. iii. p. 398. Pat. 18 Ed. I. m. 9.</NOTE>. Two singular obligations ap∣pear in this negociation; the one is from the king for payment of 3000 marks to the guardians of Scotland, if the queen of Scotland did not arrive before a day stipulated, which the bishop of Durham engaged to the states of Scotland to ob∣tain: The other is an obligation entered into by the bishop, at the king's instance, for the payment of 400 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a-year to certain persons in Norway, until the princess Margaret attained the age of fifteen years; and, in compensation, the king grant∣ed to the bishop various manors, among which Werk is one. This latter looks like the price of some political corruption<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 399. Pat. 18 Ed. I. m. 8.</NOTE>. The states assembled at Brigham made certain requisitions to the king relative to the state of their country, which the king, by his commission to the bishop of Durham, Ralph bishop of carlisle, the earls of Warren and Lincoln, William Vescy of Alnwick, knight, and Henry Newark dean of York, impowered them fully to answer, who met the estates in the middle of July following, 1290, and solemnly assented, in their sovereign's name, to every matter required on the behalf of Scotland, and the same were ra∣tified in due time by the king.</P>
<P>On these matters being settled to the satisfaction of the people of Scotland, king Edward, in consequence of his obligation, by which he ratified the concessions made in his name at Brigham, and which bound him to the observance of the laws and customs of that kingdom, appointed a lord-lieutenant of Scotland, in the name of the young queen and her intended husband. The bishop of Durham was the person on whom he conferred this dignity, who, by the commission, was denominated the <HI>locum-tenens</HI> of the lady Margaret queen of Scotland, and Edward his son, to administer justice and govern the kingdom, together with the guardians of the state, with the council of the prelates and nobles, and according to the established laws and customs of the realm<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Prynn, v. iii. p. 398.—Rymer's Foedera, v. ii. 487, 491.

<P>A slattering prospect was opened for extinguishing the unhappy dissentions which for ages had prevailed between the two nations, for establishing a union of the people, and subjecting the whole island under one sovereign, with the univer∣sal approbation of the subjects of both states. Edward and his descendents would of their ambition than any other. The inward peace of the island would have been secured, and those cruel and repeated warfares prevented, which had so often embrued the frontiers of both kingdoms in blood, and rendered them monuments to posterity of the most brutal cruelties and acts of savage inhumanity. But the hour which Providence had marked for so happy an event was yet at a great dis∣tance:
<PB N="231" REF="278"/>The flattering hopes of both nations were at once crushed by the hand of fate, in the death of the princess, who breathed her last in one of the Orkney islands, as she approached her dominions.</P>
<P>The king of England's impetuous mind could not resign itself to this event; he had fixed too earnest an attention on the desired acquisition to relinquish the fa∣vourite wish of encreasing his dominions by annexing Scotland to his crown. His ambition was roused, and his hope was too ardent to be extinguished by one stroke of fate. He formed a resolution to possess the first savourable opportunity for re∣ducing the state by arms. He soresaw that a number of competitors for the crown would appear, as an hereditary claim must be deduced from distant ancestry, and therefore lay upon his guard, to act in the design as circumstances might arise conducive to an accomplishment of his project. The war which ensued, and the animosity created by succeeding events, were such, for bitterness, as had not in any age before that period agitated the two nations. The alarm of the queen's death soon reached the ears of Robert Brus, and he first appeared a claimant of the crown at a convention held at Perth, supported by many friends, among whom were the earls of Mar and Athol. A civil war was foreseen on every hand; and messengers were dispatched to the king of England requesting him to draw near the frontiers, to overawe the various claimants, who began to grow tumultuous in every quarter, and prevent the effusion of blood.</P>
<P>Edward, whatever was his title, assumed the office of arbiter touching the claims to the crown of Scotland, and, as sovereign or supreme lord of that state, pro∣ceeded to determine the same. In a letter he wrote to the pope on this subject<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ford. l. ii. c. 42.</NOTE>, after the Lincoln parliament (A. D. 1301), he affirms, that divers persons con∣tending for the hereditary succession to that crown, applied to him with various requests, to do justice towards them in the matter. To which the Scots council replied, that the king of England assumed the lamb-like appearance <HI>(sub agnino vellere)</HI> of a conciliator among the contending Scots, not being invited thereto, but had cunningly allured to his interest some of the nobles of Scotland, who adhered to a party, having no just title to the crown, and rest not being able to refist him, he usurped the guardianship of the kingdom<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. c. 53. &amp; 54, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The king is charged with perplexing the dispute, by multiplying the number of competitors, who were advanced to twelve, though only the titles of Brus and Baliol, when they came to be deduced, were of real importance. The king was delayed entering on the duty of arbiter by the death of his queen, until the spring of the year 1291. He arrived at Darlington about the 16th day of April, and from thence issued summons to 57 of his military tenants of the northern counties, among whom are named John de Baliol, Robert de Brus, William de Vesey, Hugh de Lovall, the lady de Ros, Margare<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> de Ros, and William de Heron, to accompany him with horse and arms, and all the service they owed him, at Norham, for six weeks, reckoning from Easter; and the sheriffs of the northern counties received onders to give notice to all within their districts, who owed the king military service, to give the same at∣tendance
<PB N="232" REF="279"/><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rym. v. ii. so. 525.</NOTE> At the assembly convened at Norham, the bishop of Durham ad∣dressed the states of Scotland<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prynn, v. iii. p. 489.</NOTE> in the name of the sovereign, informing them, That the purpose of his coming to the borders was, in quality of direct and su∣preme lord of Scotland, to maintain the tranquillity of that kingdom, and to do impartial justice to those who claimed the crown; but, the more effectually to ac∣complish this purpose, he required, <HI>ex abundanti,</HI> of the Scots who were present, their assent to, and recognition of his sovereignty, not intending to act in this mat∣ter without their council; and that the king gave them three weeks, from the tenth day of May, to deliberate thereon, and in that time to procure such documents as they might chuse to produce to invalidate his title to that dignity, if any such they possessed.</P>
<P>On the day appointed, eight of the competitors appeared; John Baliol, by one Randolf his knight, prayed a respite till the next day, and then appearing, all the claimants made a full recognition of king Edward's title (Pinkney only excepted), by an instrument under their seals, which was followed by a written grant of the whole territory and castles of Scotland, to enable the king to give seisin to the per∣son whose claim should be confirmed. Thus circumstanced, it would not have been wondered at, if every degree of partiality had been extended in favour of him who made the most abject promises of dependence and submission to the arbi∣ter invested with such authorities. But Edward, on a fair investigation of his con∣duct, stands clear of such an imputation: He exhibited, in the conclusion of this momentous business, a specimen of that deliberation and solemnity with which important questions of right ought to be examined and tried. Berwick was agreed upon as the place where each competitor should produce the evidence to maintain his claim, and the second day of August ensuing was appointed for that purpose. The claims were then presented, and the second day of June, in the following year, was named for the king's giving judgment thereon. But, various new cir∣cumstances arising that day, an adjournment was agreed upon, and it was not till the 17th day of November, A. D. 1292, that a determination was made in favour of Baliol. Fordun attempts to impeach the king's candour, and tells us, that the king, finding the council inclining to give the preference to Bruce, and advising with some of his confidants concerning the matter, the bishop of Durham remind∣ed him of Bruce's great family and connections in England, and how formidable he would be there, if advanced to the throne of Scotland, whose kings had for∣merly been so troublesome to this nation. On which Edward replied, <HI>Par le sang de Dieu vous avez bien eschante;</HI> the matter shall go otherwise than I at first in∣tended<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Fordun also relates, that after sentence was given for Baliol, the earl of Gloucester, the nephew of Brus's wife, t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king Brus by the hand, bid the king consider what kind of judgment he had that day given, and remember, that he himself should be judged at the last day. He adds, that Robert, by command of the same earl, immediately retired, and never paid fealty or homage to Baliol. According to an extract in Leland's Collection, v. ii. p. 539. John de Warren earl of Surry, father-in-law to John Baliol, joined with Anthony Bek bishop of Durham in maintenance of Baliol's title.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I am ignorant of the exact date of the process under the <HI>quo warranto</HI> statute against the liberties of this palatinate; but, by a record in the Tower of London,
<PB N="233" REF="280"/>of the 9th of K. Ed. I. A. D. 1281, it appears that the bishop of Durham's liber∣ties were allowed before John de Vallibus and his fellow-justices itinerant in the county of Northumberland: And<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spearman's Enquiry, p. 8.</NOTE>, by a record in the parliament of the 21st of Edw. I. 1293, it appears, that an inquisition was taken touching those liberties before Hugh de Cressingham, and his fellow-justices, at Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The mode of proceeding under this statute was, that the king issued his proclamation, en∣joining all persons holding lands of the crown to lay their titles before the judges of the realm: And by the proceedings of the commissioners it appears, that they caused proclamation to be made according to the form of the statute of Gloucester, and that neither the bishop of Durham, or those claiming liberties within his pala∣tinate, came forth to justify their title; on which default, the same liberties were seized into the king's hands, until they should be relieved, and those claiming should answer to the king touching their right thereto. Those proclamations were looked upon as the source of a very great grievance; and indeed the persons who were first attacked, and could not produce their original titles, though they proved a long possession, were forced to pay large sums to the king to preserve their estates. This kind of oppression would have gone much further, had not a stop been put to it by the earl of Warren, who, appearing before the judges, was required to shew the fundamental title by virtue whereof he held his lands: He answered by drawing an old rusty sword out of the scabbard, and saying to the judges, <Q>This is the instrument by which my ancestors gained their estate, and by “this I will keep it as long as I live. King William did not conquer for himself ”alone, neither did my forefather assist him for that end.</Q> So bold an answer seemed likely to involve the earl in trouble, but it had quite a contrary effect. The king found by it how difficult it would be to exact from the nobility, upon so frivolous a pretence, the sums he expected, without falling into great inconveni∣ence. He saw plainly there were still, among the barons, persons as ready to hazard all in defence of their rights and properties as those in the time of king John and king Henry III. Those considerations inducing him to revoke his proclama∣tion, the people expressed their joy in such a manner, as plainly shewed how much they detested this oppression. But to return to the matter relative to the liberties of this palatinate, it appears by the before-mentioned record, that the bishop, ha∣ving pleaded in parliament various matters, as well in error as otherwise, had full restitution of his liberties. The articles in the inquisition most worthy the reader's attention, are, That the bishops of Durham, by their bailiffs, used to meet the king's justices in their progress at Chilewell, or Fourstanes, or Quakenbrigge, as it might happen which way they travelled, and attended them to Newcastle, to ob∣tain from them the articles of the pleas of the crown, there to be enquired of.</P>
<P>That the bishop of Durham had his chancery, and by his writs, and proper jus∣tices, held all pleas within his liberties of Durham, Sadberge, and Bedlington, on this side Coket, and Norham, beyond Coket, all within the precincts of his
<PB N="234" REF="281"/>county. That he had his mintage at Durham; had his coroners; three in the three wards of Durham, one at Sadberge, one at Bedlington, and another at Norham. That after the commission under which the king's justices acted was closed, the bishop, by his justices, might hold all pleas, as well of the crown as others, with∣in his liberties. That he had his place of execution at Durham and Norham, where he had the custom of Infangenetheof and Outfangenetheof. That he had fairs and markets at Durham, Darlington, and Norham. That at Norham he held all pleas of the crown, from fifteen days to fifteen days, or from three weeks to three weeks, at his pleasure. That he held in exigent and outlawry, with power of pardoning his outlaws. That the bishop had lately relieved the warren at Tweedmouth, where no ancient warren was; but people, by his permission, used to enjoy the liberty of chace. That the bishop grants warrenage, as his pleasure is, to those within his liberties. That his bailiffs stay all persons on the bridge of Berwick bringing wool, hides, or skins, to be sold, not having the Coket mark thereon, and seize such wares to the bishop's use, as forfeitures.</P>
<P>Divers nobles, and others, within the palatinate, enjoy sundry liberties; as the prior of Durham hath infangenetheof within all his territories, a moiety of the goods of felons condemned in his courts, &amp;c. assize of bread and other provi∣sions in Elmete<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Elvet.</NOTE>, and a moiety of all wreck of the sea, &amp;c.</P>

<P>In the year 1294, the bishop was sent ambassador from the King of England to the emperor of Germany, to conclude a treaty with that potentate, against the
<PB N="237" REF="284"/>increasing power of France. In 1295, the pope having sent two cardinals on an embassy to the English court, this prelate was pitched upon to answer them in the
<PB N="238" REF="285"/>king's name. The purport of this business was to bring about an accommodation between England and France, on which occasion the bishop delivered himself with great propriety and elegance of language in the French tongue; he not only pos∣sessing great powers of oratory, but also was esteemed one of the politest scholars of the age<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Biograph.

<P>It is evident, from the whole tenor of Edward's conduct in the management of the great affair of the succession to the crown of Scotland, and in his proceedings after the coronation of Baliol, that he had incessantly in view a design of reducing that kingdom to his entire subjection. His decision touching the claims of the competitors was impartial, and consistent with the nature of those claims, in that he held forth a character clear of reproach: To have acted otherwise would have alarmed the states, thrown them upon their guard, and in the end destroyed the great design in its very embryo. On the other hand, he knew well the ferocious minds of disappointed Scotsmen did not suffer resentment to subside unsatiated: Many were affected by the decision in Baliol's favour, and few were reconciled to it; like hidden fire, the combustion was left to gather in secret more vehemence from its restraint. The king had obtained the grounds which were to support his secret purpose; and his proceedings, after the decision, had a manifest tendency either to train Baliol and his subjects into a servile dependence on England, or to provoke the nation to revolt, which should give him an immediate pretext for le∣vying war, and reducing Scotland to a similar state with Wales; and he could not doubt but, by pursuing similar measures, he would attain the same conclu∣sion<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Adjornatio Regis Scotiae super institia episcopo Dunelmensi exhibenda.—Rymer's Foedera, v. ii. p. 632.—Rot. Scotiae, an. 21, Ed. I. nu. 36. Prynn, v. iii. p. 556.</NOTE> The various summons he sent to the king of Scotland, on the most frivo∣lous appeals, explained to him the idea the king of England had entertained of the servility and vassalage under which he held his crown. Irritated by repeated insults, derogatory to the honour of a prince reigning over a people of so martial a spirit, Baliol determined to shake off his dependence, and make an alliance with the French king, by contracting Edward his son and heir with the neice of that potentate. This negociation could not long remain a secret at the English court, which being attended with various instances of Baliol's public contempt of the king's mandates, and coupled with the insolence and outrages repeatedly commit∣ted by the Scots on the borders, brought on a most bloody and inveterate war.</P>
<P>The first capital breach of the peace which subsisted between the two nations
<PB N="239" REF="286"/>was committed by the Scots garrison of Berwick, plundering and burning several English vessels which entered that port, giving no quarter to the mariners; and an open war soon after was denounced on the part of Edward, by his seizing on the English estates of Baliol, and others of the Scots nation who did not immedi∣ately come over to his dependence. Edward came down to Newcastle in the month of March 1296, with an army of 30,000 foot, and 4,000 gens d'arms or heavy armed horsemen; together with the sorces of the bishop of Durham, consisting of 1000 foot and 500 horse: These troops of the prelate's, it is said, were not the inilitary tenants of his palatinate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robert de Graystanes tells us he had of his own family twenty-six standard-beares; and add<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed more like a lay prince than a priest or bishop.</NOTE>, but Welsh and Irish mercenaries; the people of the bishopric claiming a privilege, as <HI>halywerk-folk,</HI> of not departing the limits of the jurisdiction, being only guards of the body and possessions of St Cuthbert. But this assertion is ill grounded, for much disturbance afterwards ensued, by the biship's compelling them to this service contrary to their liberties<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Edward the First abridged them of those liberties when he interposed as a mediator between the bishop and the prior, who had then a sharp contest about certain lands, and at last would not stand to his determi∣nation, seized the liberty of the bishopric into his own hands; and then were many things searched into, and their privileges abridged in many particulars.

Sac.—Gibson's Camden.</NOTE>. Graystances, whose authority is most to be depended on, as being resident in the palatinate, says, that bishop Bek was a most magnificent prelate, living in a degree of splendor inferior to none but his sovereign, and only exceeded by the king in his military actions, skill, and power; that he was more assiduous about affairs of government than in the execution of his episcopal function. In warfare he was a powerful associate to the king, and in council sage and circumspect. In the war with Scot∣land, he says, he had with him 26 <HI>vexilarii,</HI> or standards, of his own family or principality, and his ordinary or accustomed suite consisted of one hundred and forty knights, so that he appeared more like a powerful prince than a priest or prelate. It is also said, that the banner of St Cuthbert was moved from the shrine in the church at Durham to attend the army; on which occasion the king granted to that church 40 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a-year out of the royal exchequer at Berwick, until some appropriation should be made of equal value out of the churches of Scotland. The expenditure of this yearly sum was directed by the king to be in alms, and for the maintenance of a solemn festival of the monks on the two anniversaries of their tutelary saint, sup∣port a mass-priest, and furnish wax-lights to burn before the shrine and banner whilst mass was celebrating<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rym. v. ii. p. 730.</NOTE>. The single circumstance of St Cuthbert's banner attending the army, is proof sufficient that the military tenants of the palatinate formed the bishop's corps; for that banner was as the royal standard of the pro∣vince, at the display of which all those who were bound to bear arms were obliged to resort thereto; and it would have been held as a great indignity, or rather sacrilege, to have had that banner supported by foreign mercenaries<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">R. de Graystanes.—Ang.

<P>The king of Scotland was summoned to appear at Newcastle, to answer the charges of disobedience, and for the outrages committed by his subjects, but he paid no attention thereto; on which the army moved to Bambrough. The first acts of hostility were made at Wark, where, on the defection of Robert de Ross, a detachment of 1000 men from the English army, which marched to seize that fortress, on its being evacuated by Ross's people who went over to the Scots, were set upon in the night, and most of them put to the sword. King Edward is said to have given thanks to God that this occasion fully authorised his unsheath∣ing the sword, and exculpated his conscience of the consequences to ensue. On the Wednesday after Easter he entered Scotland with his main army, by fording the river Tweed below the nunnery at Coldstream; and on the same day the bi∣shop of Durham led his forces over the river at the ford near Norham.</P>
<P>Whilst the king lay at Berwick, on the 5th of April, he received, from Blount and others Baliol's commissioners, his renunciation of homage and obedience to the crown of England. Various scenes of bloodshed ensued. The defeat at Dun∣bar was a fatal blow to the Scots; almost all the fighting men fled beyond the Frith of Forth. Robert Brus earl of Carrick was, by a commission given him at Roxburgh, empowered to receive to the king's peace the inhabitants of Annan∣dale; and his son had the like commission for the county of Carrick<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hollingsh. p. 307. A. D. 1298. In the battle of Foukirke, the bishop of Durham led the second battell of the Englishmen, consisting of 39 standards; who hasting forth to be the first that should give the ouset, when his men approached near the enemy, the bishop commanded them to stay till the kink battell, which the king led, might approach. But that valliant knight the lord Ralph Bassett of Draiton, said to him, "My lord, you may goe and say masse, which better becometh you than to teach us what we have to do; for we will doe that which belongeth to the order and custom of war," &amp;c.</NOTE>. The king of England, having received great reinforcements from Wales and Ireland, re∣duced the whole country in his progress to Perth: Whilst he remained there to celebrate the festival of St John Baptist, he received messengers from Baliol, im∣ploring peace. The bishop of Durham, on the part of the king of England, was empowered to negociate this matter, and accordingly met the king of Scotland and some of his principal nobility at the Castle of Brecken; where the unhappy monarch could obtain no better terms than an absolute resignation of his kingdom, and the submission of himself and nobles to the will of the king of England<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rym. p. 718.</NOTE>; on which Baliol's eldest son was delivered up as an hostage, and he and his father were afterwards sent to London, where they continued three years close prisoners. The king moved his army northwards as far as Aberdeen, the bishop of Durham, du∣ring the whole progress, with his provincial troops forming the van, and proceed∣ing a day's march before the main body. The king removed the <HI>palladium</HI> of Scot∣land to Westminster, the chair of Scone, used for the inauguration of the sovereign, which is said to have in its construction the stone on which Jacob slept when he had his beatisic vision. He also removed or destroyed all the royal records of the kingdom, and every monument which related to the ancient honours of that na∣tion. He summoned a parliament at Berwick, where he received the submistion of the Scottish states; and there appointed John de Warren earl of Surrey guar∣dian,
<PB N="241" REF="288"/>during his pleasure, and otherwise established such officers and orders for the government of that kingdom as he thought most expedient. Prynn, in order to stigmatise the character of the Scottish nation, sets forth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. iii. p. 665.</NOTE> an execrable record, which is presumed to be the act of Baliol: There is no reason assigned in the in∣strument for his uttering a public condemnation against the people he governed, or an abdication of all intercourse with them. The whole has the appearance of a forgery.</P>
<P>It was not long before the Scots made a struggle to shake off the intolerable yoke, with which they were burthened, under Edward's vicegerents. Warren, the guardian, advanced in years, thought the air of Scotland prejudicial to his health, and therefore took up his residence in the northern parts of England. Cressing∣ham, the treasurer, besides his overbearing pride and insolence, was charged with a merciless rapaciousness. Ormesby, the justiciary, was rigid, intolerably impe∣rious and tyrannical, adjudging to exile all those who refused the oath of fealty to the king of England. The weak state of Scotland encouraged those who ruled there to commit the most enormous excesses. At length a patriot leader arose called Wallace, not of eminent degree by birth, but by his uncommon genius, fortitude, and virtue. His stature and strength are described as gigantic, his aspect and address pleasing and popular; and he was equally renowned for subtlety in devising military stratagems, as for his prowess in conducting the most perilous at∣chievements. He had acquired a martial same by his depredations on the English borders, in his youth, having the command of a banditti of outlaws. Infinite trouble ensued to the king from the insurrections headed by this leader, who was joined by many powerful parties, particularly Robert Brus, the younger, earl of Carrick, James Stewart of Scotland, and others of that interest. The bishop of Durham being sent to enquire the circumstances of these new disturbances, gave the king full information of the danger threatened by this formidable insurrection; on which occasion he issued orders for all the military men north of Trent to join earl Warren, and proceed to suppress the rebellion. The king passed over into Flanders on his continental affairs, and left the troops ordered to advance against Scotland to the conduct of Warren and Cressingham, against whose unhappy com∣mand the insurgents every where prevailed: They took the town of Berwick, over-ran Northumberland, and prepared to besiege Durham, when a dreadful storm ensued, in which many of the Scots perished by hunger and cold. This event was attributed, by the superstitious writers of those days, to the mediation of St Cuthbert with the powers of the air, to protect his church. The Scottish forces retreated, but in their way burnt Ryton, laying waste the country in their rout, as they returned to their own territories laden with spoils.</P>
<P>The barons of England, with the clergy, who refused to grant the aids required by the king, and to attend him on his expedition to Flanders, now made a formi∣dable head in the affairs of state; and, taking advantage of the present exigence, insisted upon having a general pardon from the regent, and a ratification of the
<PB N="242" REF="289"/>great charter, and charter of the forests, together with a most valuable adage, <Q>“That no talliage, or aid, should thenceforth be imposed on the kingdom, with∣out the assent of the full legislative body, the prelates, nobles, knights, bur∣gesses, ”and other free men;</Q> and, on condition that the king should confirm the same, they consented, both clergy and laity, to grant the necessary aids for the Scottish war. The king submitted, but with evident marks of reluctance, to the terms proposed; and an army was soon after mustered at Newcastle for the Scot∣tish expedition. The king having obtained a two years truce in Flanders, hastened home to conduct this armament, and arrived at Berwick in the middle of March 1298. The barons who were in the combination before mentioned, before they would enter Scotland, insisted on the king's ratifying his confirmation of the terms exacted from the regent in his absence, jealous he would attempt to evade a consent made in a foreign country; on which the bishop of Durham, together with the earls Warren, Gloucester, and Lincoln, were authorised to swear, upon the king's soul, that, on his returning victorious, he would give his people ample satisfaction in the matter; and, soon after, ensued the victorious battle of Falkirk, at which, according to the Scala Chronica before referred to, the bishop of Durham had such a retinue, "that in hys cumpany were 32 baners." After the king had pursued the favourable consequences of the defeat in this battle, he moved southward as far as Durham, where he halted some time; but hearing the Scots were again appear∣ing in force, he returned to Tynemouth, where he remained till Christmas, and then took his rout for the fouth. In the truce made by the king in Flanders, it was stipulated, that John Baliol should be set at liberty.</P>
<P>The affairs of Scotland were for a while suspended, by a claim made by the pope of the sovereign right over that kingdom, suggesting, that it was a fief of the holy See. A parliament was summoned to assemble in the month of January A. D. 1301, to consider this astonishing claim, and a mandate issued to command all religious houses<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prynn, v. iii. p. 885.— Ibid. to the prior and convent of Durham.</NOTE>, and other societies, to make search in their records for evidence touching the matter. The result was, an express declaration of the barons, that they, as guardians of the rights of the crown, would never permit their king to answer ju∣dicially before the pope touching any of those rights. After this explicit answer, the English arms carried with them victory wherever they passed.</P>
<P>The metropolitan See of York had commenced a claim of jurisdiction over the See of Durham which could not easily be renounced. The death of archbishop William did only occasion the dispute to subside a little; for his successor, John Romaine, some few years after his accession, and whilst bishop Bek was attending the business of the state, and then accompanying the king on the northern borders about the affairs of Scotland, sent to Durham, by the pope's authority, John de Emelye his notary-public, and William de Wilton of Pickering<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the record, called J. de Aurelia, and W. de Worlton. dict. de Pyke.</NOTE>, his clerks, with official letters of citation, and canonical mandates. John de Maydenstan constable of the Castle of Durham, and others the bishop's officers there, esteeming this an intrusion on the privileges of the See, imprisoned the messengers in the Castle of
<PB N="243" REF="290"/>Durham, and there held them in close durance until the bishop's instructions could be obtained, who approved the conduct of his officers, and ordered the prisoners to be detained, in defiance of several admonitions sent him in writing by the arch∣bishop to enlarge them; on which the archbishop thundered out a sentence of in∣terdict against him for not releasing them, <Q>contrary to his canonical obedience, “to the peril of his soul, and the great injury, high contempt, and attenuation of his archiepiscopal authority, church, and religion; and for refusing to give any competent satisfaction for those contempts, after the parties were released by process out of the king's secular courts, he issued his precept to the prior of Boulton to excommunicate the bishop of Durham in the churches of Allerton ”and Darlington, and other places<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prynn, v. iii. p. 456.</NOTE>.</Q> The prior accordingly published his ex∣communication, according to the mandate, which occasioned a complaint to come before parliament in the ensuing year.

Secondly, The archbishop's high offence against the king's crown and dignity, in presuming to enforce the bishop and them to release his imprisoned clerks by his own ecclesiastical censures of interdict and excommunication, not by the king's processe and authority, according to the law and custom of the realm. Thirdly, The archbishop's justification of this his usurpation to the uttermost, and his demurrer to the king's and parliament's jurisdiction to question or judge him for it. Fourthly, That for any archbishop or prelate to excommunicate any person in the king's service, or attending on his royal person by his com∣mand, and under his protection, or any other, for temporal affairs, is a very high contempt, offence against the king's crown and dignity, tending to the king's and his heirs disinheriting, by the unanimous resolution of the king, and of all his nobles, barons, judges, council, in this parliament; which they adjudged to be punished not only then, but in all succeeding ages, by imprisonment of the persons of such archbishops, bishops, and others, who should be found guilty thereof, and also by great fines and ransoms to the king. Fifthly, That this archbishop was then adjudged to be committed prisoner to the tower, notwith∣standing his pall; and enforced to enter into a recognizance, with sureties, to
<PB N="244" REF="291"/>pay a sine of 4000 marks to the king, notwithstanding his insisting on his archi∣episcopal privileges, and the nobles mediation on his behalf: A great sum in ”that age.</Q></P>
<P>The bishop, amongst his other qualities, had an unbounded arrogance of mind: He attempted to break in upon the privileges of the convent, which he wished to govern as his caprice or pride might dictate. He obtained the resignation of prior Richard de Claxton by his subtlety, and appointed Henry de Horncastre guardian of the church, until a prior was elected, contrary to the usage of the convent, it being the sub-prior's duty. Hugh de Derlington, formerly prior, was appointed; and the resigning prior had assigned to him, for maintenance, the cell of Were∣mouth, with the tithes of the vill of Sudwick. Prior Hugh resigned, and, in the spring of the year 1299, Richard de Hotoun was elected to that office. In the year 1300, various dissentions began between the bishop and prior<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rob. de Graystan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. —Ang. Sac. p. 748, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The prior was accused of great irregularities, touching the lands of Coldinghamshire; and the bishop was required, by several, to visit the convent, and reform the abuses. The formalities insisted upon, on this occasion, not being submitted to by the bishop, the prior requiring that he should visit alone, he was induced, in the height of resentment, to excommunicate and suspend the prior; he also pronounced an interdict against him, and at length a sentence of deprivation. The convent on this occasion was divided: Among those on the side of the bishop were the priors of Finchale and de Insula. The bishop, in the next place, descended to open acts of violence: He entered the park of Beaurepaire, and destroyed the game which abounded therein. The bishop's servants committed various outrages against the prior, imprisoned his people, and prevented the necessaries of life being carried in∣to the convent. The king, who knew the overbearing and impetuous temper of his bishop, willing to prevent the disgrace such animosities and conflicts bring upon religion, interposed as a mediator, and, in his journey to Carlisle, passed aside to Durham, in order to restore peace there. He enjoined, that the prior should con∣tinue in his office during life; and that the bishop, when he visited, might be at∣tended by three or four of his clergy; and thereupon declared, tha the party who first infringed the accommodation he had concluded, should make him his utter enemy; which he punctually maintained; for the bishop, soon after, renew∣ing his acts of violence, the king took the part of the convent in the warmest man∣ner. The dissention of the monks was succeeded by a breach between the bishop and his people, no doubt fomented at this time by the influence of the deposed prior, to encrease the public odium against the haughty prelate. The people com∣plained, that the bishop compelled them to attend him with horse and arms in the war with Scotland, and when some of them returned home without leave, on the second campaign, on his return to Durham he cast them into prison there. They pleaded, that this was a violation of their liberties and privileges; <Q>that they were “hali-werke solks, (that is, registered or enrolled for holy work); that they held their lands by service of defending the body and possessions of St Cuthbert, and
<PB N="245" REF="292"/>ought not to march out of the confines of their bishopric, namely, beyond the ”Tyne and Tees, in the service of their sovereign, or bishop.</Q> The leaders of this dissention were Ra. de Neville and John Marmaduc, to whom were joined the chief part of the military and free tenants of the bishopric, who brought the complaint before parliament.</P>
<P>Three months after the suspension and deposition of the prior, the bishop con∣voked the monks who were in his interest, and enjoined them to clect a prior, or otherwise he would appoint one himself. On their refusal, he named H. de Luce∣by prior of Holy Island, to be prior of Durham; and, in order to give him posses∣sion, and eject prior Richard, he sent for his foresters of Weredale and men of Tynedale, who beset the convent, and kept the monks shut up, not permitting provisions to be carried in: They cut the aqueduct which supplied the house with water; forced open the gates of the priory and cloister, and so closely confined the prior and monks in the church for three days, that they were in the greatest distress for want of sustenance. At length, on the day of St Bartholomew, some of the monks, who were the bishop's adherents, pulled the prior from his seat, and H. de Luceby was immediately installed; after which the monks professed obe∣dience, under the influence of such coercion and terror. Prior Richard was put under confinement, with two monks most attached to him. It is said the new prior accepted the office because the bishop had vowed, on his refusal, to prefer some foreigner.</P>
<P>Prior Richard, thus in confinement, studied in what manner he should effect his escape; and having obtained permission to take the air, with due attendants, he came to Shincliff bridge, where he was met by eight persons, who led a horse pro∣perly furnished, and obliged him to mount. On this his guard, in astonishment, fled to the convent. The prior escaped into Cleveland, where he remained till the parliament met at Lincoln, when he complained of the injuries he had sustained, and then obtained the king's letters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prynn, v. iii. p. 912. Pat. 29th Ed. I. m. 23.</NOTE> for his passing to Rome, to lay his grievances before that court. In the same parliament appeared many persons of the bishop∣ric on the complaint before mentioned. The king at that assembly was much of∣fended with the bishop; for, asking him whether he stood with him against the earls Marshall and Hereford, and the other barons of the realm there met, the bishop replied, <Q>That those personages were assiduous in the promotion of the ho∣nour “and interest of the king and the realm, therefore he stood with them, and not ”with the king against them.</Q> This noble speech preserves the bishop's name to posterity, and ought to have had a more immediate reward in the esteem of good men. It enraged the king against him, already inclined to be his enemy; he dis∣sembled a reconciliation with the earls, but thenceforth held the bishop in the great∣est hatred. Bek's situation and abilities were such, that it appears as if Edward looked upon him too powerful sor a subject, and, notwithstanding his services, sought occasion to reduce his influence. He is described as the richest prelate (if we except Wolsey) that ever held the palatinate of Durham; for, besides the re∣venue
<PB N="246" REF="293"/>of his bishopric, he possessed a temporal estate of 5000 marks a-year, pars of which, it is said, he gained by unjustly converting to his own use, an estate which he held in trust for the natural son of the baron de Vesey. Camden speaks of this transaction with just condemnation, and says, that William de Vescy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, v. ii. p 912.</NOTE>, whose legitimate son John died in the Welsh wars, gave some of his lands in Ire∣land to king Edward, on condition that his natural son William de Kildare might inherit his estate, and made our bishop his feoffee in trust for the use of his son, who did not acquit himself justly in this confidence; for he alienated the barony and Castle of Alnwick for a large sum of money to Henry lord Percy, in whose family they have hitherto remained<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 334.</NOTE>. Eltham was another part of Vescy's estate, where the bishop built an elegant palace, and presented it to Edward's consort. But these instances of misconduct could not so effectually serve to alienate the king's affections: He had filled the highest trusts and employments in the state with character; he rendered the king important services in the war, and was not only a man of deep erudition in that age, but also possessed of much perspicuity, and a fluent eloquence. By the defection of John Baliol, his large possessions in the territories of Castle Barnard, within this jurisdiction, became forfeited, and were escheats to the bishop in right of his See, as were those of Robert Brus at Hert, Hertness, or Hartlepool. These were important possessions, and enlarged the powers of the palatine of Durham. The port of Hartlepool, which was Brus's, was part of the forfeiture, and, falling into the bishop's hands, became a great addition to the importance of this province. The navigation of the river Tyne was partially possessed; the bishop had quays on the southern shore, and the king on the northern; so that, in such situation, the ships of the bishop were over∣awed by the fortress of Newcastle, and the king's garrison there. The port of Weremouth was not then much used, and is hardly mentioned. Indeed, on Mal∣colm's expedition, he found, on board some small vessels there, Edgar, with his family and adherents, prepared to sail for Scotland. The chief possessions there appertained to the religious society. Hartlepool was open, and well calculated at once to fit out an armament, as to secure a fleet, so as to be ready on every emergency: It was of sufficient consequence in bishop Pudsey's time to receive ships from Flanders, in which he brought 500 foot soldiers, with the knights that garrisoned Northallerton Castle. The regalia of the bishop already appeared too great in the eye of Edward for a subject, and no wonder he should be desirous of reducing them, and abridging the power of a prelate, of whose strength and capa∣city he had received so perfect an example in the Scottish war. To support the ap∣peal of the bishop's military tenants, and restrain them within the consines of the palatinate, would, in a capital degree, have essected his purpose. Baliol's posses∣sions, on the western confines of the province, was of great importance in cases of intestine broils. The fortress of Castle Barnard had hitherto proved impreg∣nable, and it commanded an extensive tract of country, from whence abundance of supplies in provision could be drawn on any emergency; besides, it was a
<PB N="247" REF="294"/>bulwark of the highest importance on any incursion<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Scots. It is not pro∣bable the disputes with the convent, or a trespass committed against the liberties of the bishop's military tenants, which in effect proved so serviceable to the king, would have been estimated in so criminal a degree as they were, had not the king's mind been inclined to seek occasion for a rupture. He could not so readily have forgot the faithful and valuable services he had received from the bishop, and give up his whole spirit to aversion and oppression, had not some latent motives influ∣enced his misconduct. The bishop had 140 knights in his fuite at this parliament.</P>
<P>In consequence of the deposed prior's application, the bishop was summoned personally to answer the charge made against him, in the court of Rome. He did not obey this summons, sending proctors thither to answer for him. His ad∣versary was graciously received by the pope and cardinals; Luceby's nomination was adjudged irregular; and restitution was decreed to the prior. The bishop's disobedience was next proceeded upon: The pope pronounced his contumacy and suspension from episcopal function; and he was then cited to appear at Rome un∣der greater penalties. He obeyed this citation, and in his entry into Rome made a most splendid parade. He received especial marks of favour from the pope, whose ordonance, on his return, he brought with him, confirming his right of visiting the convent, with two clerks, a notary, and one religious of the same order. It appears that the bishop left England, on this journey to Rome, with∣out the king's licence; which was imputed to him as an additional offence, and contributed to bring upon him, or at least was seized as a pretext for, the severity of prosecution and wrath of the king, afterwards exercised against him.</P>
<P>Under these encreased offences, the king seized the liberties of the palatinate, and appointed Robert de Clifford custos thereof, with a stipend of 200 marks a year out of the revenues of the See; William de Ormesby justiciary, with a stipend of 60 marks per annum; Henry Gilford keeper of the seals; and other officers, turning out the bishop's chancellor, and those of his appointment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pryn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, v. iii. p. 939.</NOTE>. The bishop stood deprived till the parliament was assembled in the succeeding year, when an agreement was entered into between the bishop and the men of his province, which was made a record of that high court: The chief articles of privilege then established are as follow<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 99<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>That no freeman shall be imprisoned by the bishop's bailisss in his franchise, otherwise than is used in other places in the realm, and the inquests to be made by the bishop's coroners, as is elsewhere used in the realm, according to the form of the statute.</P>
<P>The people prayed that no freeman of the bishopric be impleaded in court Chris∣tian, but only in case of wills and matrimony; and that those who are impleaded on other matters in the same court, may have prohibition and attachment against the ossicial, as well as against the party. The bishop grants, that prohibition or attachment shall be denied to none; and that those that contravene the prohibition shall be punished according to law.</P>
<PB N="248" REF="295"/>
<P>Every man may make a mill, so that it be not upon land that owes suit to the bishop's mill; and that every man may win mines of coal and iron in his lands, and also where others have common, in the same manner as the bishop does in his lands, and where others have common.</P>
<P>And whereas no freeman ought by custom to be impleaded except in the free court of the bishop, yet the bishop's bailiffs compel them to be impleaded at the halemotes, and amerce them among villains, contrary to the common law of the realm. The bishop grants, that no freeman shall come, unless he will come there to complain against a villain; and if wrong is done him by any villain, and he will complain of it elsewhere, in the free court, a writ shall be granted him.</P>
<P>The men of the bishopric used to be free of toll and all manner of duties in the out villages, but the bishop's bailiffs of late have taken money for toll of those who buy corn and cattle in the extreme villages, as in market towns; a thing never done in the time of the bishop's predecessors: The bishop therefore grants, that no toll shall be taken, except in the same places and in the same manner as used to be taken anciently.</P>
<P>No carriage to be taken, except in time of war, from the freemen. No sub∣bailiff of the coroner be mounted on horseback.</P>
<P>All the people of the bishopric used to have free ingress and egress at the gate of the Bailey, to go to the holy body of St Cuthbert; but the bishop and his offi∣cers, of late, have not permitted it. The bishop grants, that none be disturbed in future, except in time of war, and other times when guard is to be kept there; and even at such times they may go freely in and out, except people of suspicious character and appearance.</P>
<P>The following articles relate to the rights of the chace, and of forests and com∣mons.</P>
<P>Though the matter of service in war, without the limits of Tyne and Tees, is not determined in this record, yet the imprisonment of offenders is restrained, and, in consequence, those who might in future return from such service without leave, are declared free from the punishment complained of.</P>
<P>It appears that the bishop had made submission to the king; for, after this agreement, he was received again to the royal favour, and his bishopric was re∣stored<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The king issued his writ of privy seal to his chancellor to make his special writ of restitution of the franchises.—Ex Bundela Brevium de privato sigillo, &amp;c.

But the displeasure the bishop had entertained against the convent could
<PB N="249" REF="296"/>not be removed; his obstinate pride was superior to reconciliation, and an indig∣nity once committed could not be expiated: Such was the prelate's inexorable temper. Pope Boniface having departed this life, Benedict was elected to the See of Rome, from whom the bishop obtained a bull, directed to the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishops of Lincoln and Worcester, commanding them to visit the convent of Durham. The bishop accused the prior of dilapidations and other offences, touching which the pope commissioned the above-named prelates to make due enquiry; but before any determination was had, the pope died. In the year 1305 pope Clement was elected, who, in the first year of his pontificate, created the bishop of Durham Patriarch of Jerusalem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ang. Sac. p. 752.</NOTE>. On the charges he brought against the prior, the pope, at his instance, suspended him, as well in temporali∣ties as in spiritual matters. The prior intending to travel to Rome to make a per∣sonal defence, took up his residence for the winter near Canterbury, and sent two monks, his proctors, to prepare his appeal. The bishop committed the care of the religious house to H. de Luceby; and a mandate was obtained from the pope, directing the abbot of Lasenby to give him possession: But when they came to the convent, the monks shut the door against them, and denied them entrance; on which they excommunicated the prior, the heads of the convent, and all those who refused their admittance. This occasioned new troubles: The pope interfering with temporalities, was an invasion of the rights of the crown, which brought on a judicial examination of the whole transaction, and the parties were loaded with a heavy fine. The prior afterwards, returning from the southern parts, met the king at Durham, in whose presence he celebrated mass at the altar of St Oswald, on that saint's anniversary. He obtained the king's recommendatory letters to the See of Rome, and was received by the pope and cardinals with great attention. After a short time he prepared to return, with a sentence of restitution, for which the treasury of the convent was commanded to pay 1000 marks; but the prior de∣parted this life at Rome, and his goods, horses, plate, books, and jewels were con∣fiscated to the pope's use. William de Tanfield, prior of Wederhall, succeeded, at the instance of the See of Rome, who was charged with purchasing this office by the payment of 3000 marks to the pope, and 1000 marks to the cardinals<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">R. de Graystanes.—Lel.

<P>The king, having failed in his purpose of humbling bishop Bek by the authority of his parliament, on the complaint of the men of his palatinate, lay wait for occa∣sions to effect his purpose; and, in the year 1306, he again deprived the bishop, and seized the liberties of the bishopric, for various new offences charged against him<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">A.

In his late quarrels with the convent, he had procured such instruments from the court of Rome as were adjudged injurious to the rights of the crown: He had also shewed his contempt of the king's command, in persisting in his per∣secution of the monks, besides other offences now imputed to him, by which the king's resentment was renewed. Indeed it appears he was assiduous in seeking occasion to humble the prelate, as well as gratify his implacable hatred, which, notwithstanding late appearances, still rankled at his heart; and, after this last
<PB N="250" REF="297"/>breach, he never was reconciled to the bishop during his existence. The guardi∣anship of the bishopric was again committed to Robert de Clifford. The king now stretched his authority to that pitch, as to fever from the palatinate Barnard Castle, with its appendages, which he granted to the earl of Warwick: Hert and Hertness, or Hartlepool, he also took away from the bishop's lands, and granted to Robert de Clifford; and Keverston, which escheated to the palatine on the for∣feiture of Christopher de Seaton, was given by the king to Geoffrey de Hercem∣pole<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 391.—Ang. Sac. p. 754.</NOTE>. It is observable, that the convent of Durham, at the king's instance, con∣firmed those grants under their conventual seal: But the king, conscious of the injury he was doing to the rights of the church, inserted a protecting salvo in the instruments by which these territories were conveyed. The king also dismembered from the See, Werk in Tindale, Penrith in Cumberland, and the church of Sy∣mondburn in Northumberland, which the bishop had of the gift of the king of Scotland, alledging they were previously forfeited to the crown.</P>
<P>Whilst the bishopric was under this last seizure, and in the keeping of Clifford, the nominees of the See of Rome prepared, by virtue of their commission, to en∣ter into those liberties, to enforce payment of arrears of certain dismes, notwith∣standing the king's several prohibitions; on which, by advice of his council, he is∣sued his mandate to the guardian, strictly commanding him not to permit them to execute any thing there touching that matter. This, and other oppositions, of∣fended the pope so much, that he sent letters to the king, complaining of the wrongs he had done to the church at Durham, and commanding him to reform such excesses, and make restitution<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prynn, v. iii. p. 1130.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>At the parliament held at Carlisle, 1307, immediately preceding the king's death, it was represented, that the bishop of Durham had greatly wasted the woods appertaining to his bishopric, particularly by supplying iron forges, smelting of lead, and making charcoal; on which an inhibition was awarded, to prevent such waste in future<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ryley's Plac. p. 335.—Ang. Sac. p. 745.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The various circumstances attending king Edward's last campaign in the Scottish war, are not sufficiently pertinent to this work to demand a place here. Brus was now at the head of the Scottish army, and the king, with all the inveteracy of implacable hatred, vowing the utter ruin of a nation whose greatest offence was resistance of his oppressions, and their love of liberty, now carried with him the prince of Wales, to inspire his heart with the same rancour which irritated the vengeance his father cherished. He conferred the order of knighthood on a band of 300 youths, sons of the greatest English families, who were to share the laurels preparing for the prince their leader. The king made a bloody vow on the occa∣sion, which his son seconded by a similar one, purporting, that he would not rest two nights in one place, till his father's purpose was accomplished. The succeed∣ing events were full of the tremendous executions of war. Christopher Seaton, brother-in-law to Brus, with several other prisoners of the first rank, were drawn, hanged, and quartered, at Dumfries. Thomas and Alexander Brus were made
<PB N="251" REF="298"/>prisoners, and executed at Carlisle. But those severities could not subdue the spi∣rits of a fierce and heroic people: The loss of relations, the cry of injuries, and the spoil and devastation of a country, only irritated them to more desperate acts of valour, and insuperable fortitude, adding thereto the rage of despair, and the gall of revenge. Brus, with a small army of desperate heroes, gained a multitude of advantages against the parties with whom he engaged, which induced the king, then in a very precarious state of health, beset with the infirmities of old age, and labouring under threatening shocks of an incurable disease, to march from Carlisle, at the head of the main army; but he was not able to advance further than about two miles north of Burgh upon Sands, where he expired in the arms of his at∣tendants.</P>
<P>Thus departed one of the greatest monarchs that ever wore the diadem of Eng∣land. He was a man of a clear judgment, possessing a mind fired with the quick∣est apprehension, and the justest images. His valour and courage were superior to every danger: In military knowledge he was not equalled by any cotemporary, and in ardour he outstripped the generals of the age. His temper was hasty; he was jealous of an affront, and unremitting in his enmity. He paid all due reve∣rence to the ministers of religion, yet was no bigot, and detested superstitious sla∣very. As a legislator, the laws made in his reign have spread their influence to this distant age, and greatly contribute to maintain the happy constitution of this king∣dom. Whether the commons were admitted distinctly to a share in the legislative body of this nation, before his reign, is a matter of speculation too deep and in∣tricate for these pages; but certain it is, under this prince they stand confirmed as part thereof, and from his time have constantly formed a branch of the legislature, and thereby maintained, and rendered permanent, the liberties of the subject, and the franchises of this highly favoured country. This, and the law respecting tallages, make the memory of Edward I. immortal to the lovers of this country.</P>
<P>It is observable, that, in 1295, when Edward caused the sheriffs to invite the towns and boroughs, of the different counties, to send their deputies to parlia∣ment, and when the representation of the people was more especially called for in the great assemblies of the state, this palatinate did not partake of the invitation, but, holding fast its ancient privileges, the bishop, with his council, formed those provincial institutes which were necessary for the government of this district. The viceroy and his people were subject to the general laws of the empire, and they were obligatory on this province; but the ancient legislation prevailed in the pe∣culiar rules and orders of the palatinate. Durham was no otherwise represented in parliament, than by the prelate's sitting in the house of peers.</P>
<P>This being a great aera in our constitution, it may not be amiss to remark in this place, that the statute of Henry IV. which enjoins proclamation to be made by the sheriff in his county, doth not imply, that all persons present there should pro∣ceed to election of knights, but only all <HI>suitors</HI> of that court; so that the succeed∣ing restriction to qualifications of 40<ABBR>s.</ABBR> a-year was not an exclusion which operated on inhabitants at large<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So inconsiderable was the number of freeholders, prior to the 8th Hen. VI. 1429, that, for every in∣dividual then, there were at least fifty persons who possessed the right of voting at the last general election; and, at the above date (1429), not one in a hundred persons was a frecholder, possessing the boasted fran∣chise.</NOTE>, but freeholders only, for such were suitors of the county,
<PB N="252" REF="299"/>and few they were in number in that age. In consequence, the modern cry of ge∣neral representation is not grounded on principles of that antiquity, but must refer to much more distant, even in the Saxon times, of whose customs, in regard to the witagenmote, we have imperfect evidence. The statutes relative to proclamation of writs of election remedied the partial summons sheriffs had been used to give, they, being officers of the crown, too frequently, in servility to government, sum∣moned only such as were certain to accord with the measures proposed.</P>
<P>Edward II. no sooner succeeded to the throne, than he testified a dislike to the vengeful injunctions of his father: He made a short progress into Scotland, and, leaving a general there, more for the purpose of receiving the submission of those who were not adherents to Brus than to prosecute the war, he repaired to the capi∣tal. But this was not the most striking instance of his contempt of his father's will; for, contrary to his most earnest injunctions, even attended with a horrid curse, he recalled from exile his licentious favourite Gaveston, and, heaping ho∣nours upon him, amongst other instances of high distinction, created him earl of Cornwall. It is presumed bishop Bek joined with the flatterers who crouded round the throne of this dissolute prince, and encouraged his affections for Gave∣ston; and, by insinuations of the like depraved nature, ingratiated himself into king Edward's favour, through which he not only obtained restitution of his bishopric, but also a grant of the sovereignty of the Isle of Man for life: So that from the disgrace which overshadowed him in the close of the last reign, we see him emerging with the distinguished dignities of palatine of Durham, king of Man, and patriarch of Jerusalem. The restitution was made at Carlisle, 4th September 1307<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rym. v. iii. p. 9.</NOTE>, under the specious language, <Q>for the honour of God, of the glorious “confessor St Cuthbert, and for the especial affection he had long entertained for ”the bishop.</Q> But though the bishopric was restored, the grants of Barnard Castle, Keverston, Hert, and Hertness, were not reversed; neither do we hear of any attempt made by the bishop to recover them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

<P>Brus still advanced in power, and made rapid progress in the reduction of those leaders who opposed him; yet, amidst various successes against the English forces, a truce was agreed upon; and, at the conclusion of the term stipulated for that armistice, the king of England ordered a body of forces to rendezvous at Ber∣wick; to which place the bishop of Durham was required to send from his bishop∣ric 300 men, and 200 from Tynedale<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The king issued his writ to enable persons under this summons to compound the servi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> by a money pay∣ment.

This re∣cent instance, after the privilege claimed by the military tenants of the palatinate, proves that their liberties were not adjudged by parliament sufficiently extensive to protect them from carrying arms beyond the limits of Tyne and Tees. The king's embarrassment touching his favourite grew to a great head. Gaveston's insolence, overbearing authority, and lascivious character, gained him the utter detestation of the barons, who formed a party so powerful in the parliament held at Westminster, A. D. 1310, as to oblige the king to confer, on a select committee of twenty-one persons, full authority to ordain every reformation requisite for the good govern∣ment of the state, as well as regulation of the royal household; whence they had the name of <HI>lords ordainers.</HI> It appears that the patriarch, after he had gained his purpose, withdrew his flattery from the follies of the prince, and attached himself to the barons and prelates who opposed the king's errors. King Edward, in Sep∣tember, entered Scotland with a powerful army, by the eastern march: The great earls of Lancaster, Pembroke, Warwick, and Hereford, remained in England, professing such a detestation of Gaveston, that they would not serve the king in his army where he was present; but, whilst they remained at home, were studiously concerting measures for restraining the regal power within constitutional limits, and for separating the execrable favourite from the arms of his sovereign. The king made no extensive progress in Scotland, but, where he passed, he reduced the country to a desert, destroying every thing on the face of the earth; which acts of barbarity were followed by a dreadful dearth, in which the inhabitants were obliged to sustain life with carrion, and others the most miserable means.</P>

<P>His public works were magnificent. In the year 1292, he erected the parish church of Chester in the Street into a deanry, with seven prebends, obliging the dean and prebendaries, by oath, to personal residence. He did the like at Lanchester, and obtained the royal confirmation thereto<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prynn, v. iii. p. 460. Vide Lanchester and Chester, v. ii.</NOTE>. He founded the priory of Alvingham in Lincolnshire, the revenue of which, at the dissolution, amounted to 141 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 15 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> He gave the manor of Evenwood to the cathedral church of Durham<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rob. de Graystanes. —Ang. Sac. p. 754.</NOTE>. He re∣built the manor-house at Auckland, which he castellated, added thereto an elegant chapel, and appropriated the church of Morpeth for the maintenance of the chap∣lains appointed to perform divine service therein. This appropriation, after his death, was reversed by Ralph, son of William lord Greystock, who recovered the right of presentation to the same, at law. Leland seems to have confounded the chapel at Auckland Castle with the deanry of St Andrew Auckland: His words are; <Q>He made also an exceeding goodly chapel ther of stone, welle squarid, “and a college, with dene and prebendes yn it, and a quadrant on the south-west ”side of the Castell, for ministers of the college<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Leland's Itin. v. i. p. 78.</NOTE>.</Q> The bishop built the Castle of Somerton, near Lincoln, which he gave to the king, who afterwards granted it to H. de Bello-monte. He also built the manor of Eltham, as before observed, which he gave to the queen; the remains of which, to this time, point out the magnificent taste of this prelate. He added greatly to the buidings of the Castle of Barnard, and also to Alnwick Castle<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Biog. Brit.</NOTE>. He also made some considerable erec∣tions at Gainford and Coniscliff, as well as other parts of his bishopric. He gave to the church of Durham two pictures, containing the history of our Saviour's na∣tivity, to be hung as an ornament over the great altar on the festival of Christ∣mas.</P>
<P>Mr Noble says of this prelate's coinage, <Q>There is no other money of this “bishop, or of any of his successors, but pennies: The reason of this is, that when the bishops of this See obtained the grant of a mint, it was the only sort of money we had: The archbishops of Canterbury and York for some time coined only the penny. The first ecclesiastical mint that struck any other sort of money than the penny, was that of the abbots of Reading, who had a particular charter for that purpose granted them by K. Edward III. in whose reign we have the penny, halfpenny, and the farthing<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Mr Leake's Historical Account of English Money, p. 91, 92. and Mr Bartlet on the Episcopal Coins of Durham, &amp;c. vol. v. of the Archaelogia, p. 338. The latter gentleman acquaints us, that the abbot of Reading had a grant from K. Edw. I. to coin pennies.</NOTE>. It seems very strange that the prelates, particularly the metropolitans, should not have had this privilege as soon as the abbots of Reading. In process of time, however, half groats, and half pence, were coined in the mints of the archbishops of Canterbury and of York; and the ambitious Wolsey, as primate of York, ”was bold enough to coin groats.</Q></P>
<P>This prelate's money is distinguished by a cross moline (his family arms) upon some part of them, whereof he was ostentatious, as appears by his seal.</P>

<P>Mr Noble gives examples of the coin.—"No. 1. on the obverse, is, EDW. R. ANGL. DNS.

No. 2. the cross moline appears in the second quarter, in the room of the three pellets: It reads also, CIVI∣TAS DUREME. Both these, it may be ob∣served, were coined during the reign of K. Edw. I. The money coined by this bishop, in the reign of K. Edw. II. is distinguished by having the legend on the obverse: EDWA, EDWAR, or EDWARD, R. ANGL. DNS. HYB. They have the cross moline placed before the legend: On the reverse we have the same words as on those coined in the last reign; but the cross moline is not upon any part of this side."</P>
<P>In taking a review of this prelate's character, it must be remembered, that he enjoyed a plu∣rality of cures, and was secretary to the king at the time he was advanced to the See of Durham. The first instance in which he shewed the boldness of a resolute judgment, was in his answer to the archbishop's de∣mand of excommunicating his convent. His fortitude, when beset by russians at Rome, who broke into his apartment, to revenge the insults committed by his servants, and his answer to king Edward I. which first occasioned his sovereign's hatred, shewed his unshaken magnanimity of soul. Had his other principles been as noble, his cha∣racter would have been as illustrious as his life was magnificent. But his pride was prevalent in every action of his life: It was the bias by which every part of his conduct was influenced; and that pride affronted, brought forth implacable aversion, as has been seen in his contests with the convent, in which it is evident he could not brook the indignity of contradiction; so highly did he estimate his own consequence. He was pleased with military parade, and martial discipline; but though he was desirous of a retinue of soldiers about him, he affected a seeming indifference and negligence towards them, and shewed no concern whilst the greatest nobles bent the knee to him, and officers of the army waited stand∣ing as he sat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rob. de Graystanes.—Ang. Sac. p. 746.</NOTE>. He thought nothing too dear that could contribute to his public same for magnificence; as an instance of which, Graystanes tells us, one time in London he paid 40 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> for forty fresh herrings (now about 80 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> sterling money) when they had been refused by the most opulent persons of the realm, then assembled in parliament. At another time he bought a piece of cloth, which was held up a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so high a price, that, proverbially, it was said to be too dear for the bishop of Dur∣ham, which he ordered to be cut into cloths for his sumpter horses. He seized the king's palfrey as a deodand, it having killed its rider in the way to Scotland,
<PB N="256" REF="303"/>within the liberties of his palatinate. His breach of confidence in depriving the son of Vescy, and selling the barony of Alnwick, was derived from a wound his pride received in some contemptuous jest the bastard put upon him, which he never could forgive; and, in gratifying his resentment, he was guilty of the basest perfidy to his deceased friend. He was so impatient of rest, that he never took more than one sleep, saying, it was unbecoming a man to turn from one side to the other in bed. He was perpetually either riding from one manor to another, or hunting or hawking. Though his expences were very great, he was provident enough never to want money. He always rose from his meals with an appetite; and his continence was so singular, that he never looked a woman full in the face: Whence, in the translation of St William of York, when the other bishops de∣clined touching the Saint's remains, through a consciousness of having forfeited their virginity, he alone boldly handled them, and assisted the ceremony with due reverence. This matter cost him a very large sum of money<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rob. de Graystanes.

<P>His tomb was covered with a large marble, with the following inscription on a brass plate around the same, according to Willis<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bishop Tanner mentions a number of Anthony Bek's preferments; but there is a confusion in the ac∣count of them which we should not have expected in that learned writer; and two of them are evidently ir∣reconcileable with chronology, being placed several years after Bek's death. The subject is so trilling, that we shall not enter into a farther discussion of the matter. Though it is said in the text, that our bishop died in 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>10, we think that Godwin, Wharton, and Tanner, place it with greater propriety in 1311. The same time, indeed, is intended; but it ought to be remembered, that our carlier writers usually reckou the beginning of the year from the birth or circumcision of our Saviour, and not from the annunciation. By the way, Dr Richardson, in a note, corrects Godwin, as guilty of a mistake, and refers to a privy seal in Rymer's Feadera, for seizing our prelate's temporalities into the hands of the king, as a proof that Bet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s death should be dated in 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>10. It happens that the authority of the Fordera is directly on the other side.

<P>With them were joined, both in company and affec∣tion, the forces of the noble bishop of Durham, the most valiant clerk in the kingdom, and truly a true Christian; by which I would be understood that he was wise, elo∣quent, temperate, just, and chaste, unequalled by any rich man in his regular manner of living. He had neither pride, avarice, nor envy; not that he wanted a proper spirit to defend his rights, when he could not work on his enemies by gentle measures, for he was so guided by his conscience as to make every one marvel. In all the king's wars he used to appear in noble array, attended by a numerous and honourable retinue.</P>
<P>But he had, I know not in what disturbance, received a wound, which detained him in England, and prevented his coming into Scotland; he, nevertheless, knowing the king's expedition, sent him one hundred and sixty of his men at arms, possessed of more accomplishments than Arthur received from Merlin.</P>
<P>He sent also his ensign, which was gules with a fer de moulin of ermine.</P>

<P>Although the See continued vacant a very short time, the contentions of the archbishop of York greatly disturbed the convent. The prior and chapter, imme∣diately after bishop Bek's death, exercised their jurisdiction, in appointing officers during the vacancy. This occasioned the metropolitan to thunder out his excom∣munication against all parties acting therein. A licence was obtained from the king, then at Berwick, for electing a prelate. Bishop Bek departed this life on the 3d day of March 1310; the licence was had on the 20th, and the election on the last day of the same month; the exigencies of state urging that important of∣fice to be filled with as little de possible. The king, according to custom, appointed Henry de Percy guardian of the vacant bishopric, and Robert de Bar∣ton receiver of the revenues<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rob. de Grtystanes.—Ang. Sac. p. 755.—Rymer's Foedera, v. iii. p. 251, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Before the day of election, the king sent the earl of Gloucester to Durham, entreating the convent to nominate his kinsman Antoline de Pisana, an alien by birth, unknown to any of the monks, and said to be under canonical age. Many rich presents were offered to induce the chapter to consent, but, with much reli∣gious virtue, they refused. The convent was in great confusion touching the man∣ner in which the election should be made: They knew that the archbishop would r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fuse to confirm any act done by those under his excommunication; and to with∣draw themselves, was an actual submission to the offensive exercise of the metro∣politan's usurped jurisdiction. Of the two evils they thought it expedient, in times of such emergency, to prevent the See remaining longer vacant; and con∣sequently absented, and left the business to those of the fraternity who were not un∣der censure; and accordingly, on the last day of March A. D. 1311, RICHARD KELLOW, a monk of that house, was chosen. He had the king's assent at Berwick on the 11th day of April, was presented to the archbishop at Newbrough on the 19th of the same month, was examined at Hexham on the 4th day of May, all parties were cited to shew cause against his election, if any was, at Brynston on the 10th; and the next day he was confirmed at Ripon. He received restitution of the tem∣poralities from the king's commissioner on the 20th, was consecrated at York on the 30th of the same month, and, on St Cuthbert's day in September, was so∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ly enthroned at Durham. After the election was over, and before confirma∣tion, the archbishop visited the chapter of Durham, reversed his censure, and re∣lieved them from the penalties and injunctions imposed by bishop Bek.</P>
<P>The greatest harmony subsisted between bishop Kellow and the monks of his convent. He took infinite pleasure in their society, and never was without some of them as his private companion. He chose his chancellor and seneschal out of the cloister, and made one of them his confessor. In like cordiality he lived with the people of his palatinate, yet maintaining a strict propriety of conduct, not spa∣ring any offender by reason of his dignity; which was instanced in the penance
<PB N="259" REF="306"/>he compelled Ralph Neville to undergo for the heinous sin of incest with his daughter. The first year after his consecration, he revoked the acts of his prede∣cessor, by deed in writing, where they were prejudicial to the convent, and resto∣red their ancient privileges. He gave to the prior and convent Wastrop-head, and a fishery in the river Were; and ordained, that the tithes of rabbits in Holy Island be paid to the prior of that cell, which he confirmed by deed in writing. In the year 1313, the prior, William de Tansield, resigned accepting the cell of Jarrow, and the manor of Wardle, for his maintenance; the sub-prior. Galfrid de Burdon, succeeded him.</P>
<P>The king's attachment to Gaveston still occasioned much trouble in the state; during which intestine distractions the Scots gained many advantages, and spread their devastations over the northern counties. The favourite shewed much per∣sonal courage whilst he commanded the army in Scotland, the enemy assiduously avoiding coming to a decisive engagement. But he was altogether so obnoxious to the leaders of the prevailing faction, that the king could not save him from the sentence of the ordainers, who condemned him to perpetual banishment. He was not the only object on whom they fixed their resentment; lord Henry de Beau∣mont, nearly allied to the queen, and his sister, the lady Vescy, were removed from court; many of the king's grants to them were reversed, particularly one of the Castle of Bambrough, which was withdrawn from the latter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Carte. ii. 320. Parl. Rolls.</NOTE>, and given to lord Percy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dugd. v i. p. 273.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the king's absence, Brus made many inroads, by which he greatly distressed the inhabitants of Northumberland, whence they were induced to enter into a se∣parate truce, for which they paid 2000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and the total reduction of Scotland was the consequence of his successful efforts in that year. Such was the unhappy state of the northern parts of England, that the king was under a necessity of sending letters to pope Clement, dated the 17th of October, to pray he might excuse the attendance of bishop Kellow at the council of Vienna, on account of the urgent occasion there was for his presence in the palatinate, to defend those territories against the Scots, whom he describes coming forth like wolves out of their dens, and committing their ravages without distinction of innocence, sex, or age, or even the holy immunities of ecclesiastical liberties<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">A.

<P>The calamities of the state, the insolence of the confederate barons, and all the distresses the king laboured under, could not wean him from his favourite, who returned to him from his exile, in January, to receive restitution of his honours, and a reversion of his sentence, by the sovereign's arbitrary act, contrary to the determination of the parliament and his council. This induced the barons, who had chosen the earl of Lancaster for their leader, to appear openly in arms, pro∣fessedly to compel the king's submission to the ordinances, and give up the minion to his sate. The queen was Gaveston's utter enemy; he had insolently affronted her, in such a manner as to induce her to make complaint to her royal father, re∣presenting,
<PB N="260" REF="307"/>presenting, that he was the sole cause of all her misfortunes; that the king's fond∣ness for the unworthy favourite had alienated his affections from her, and made him an entire stranger to her bed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rapin, p. 390.</NOTE>. This contributed to encourage the barons their purpose, and urge them to its execution. The king moved northward with his favourite, and was so expeditiously followed by a detachment of the barouns' army, that the day he left Newcastle they entered that place. From Tynemouth the king passed by sea to Scarborough, and there left Gaveston, presuming the fortress impregnable, till he should raise forces to repel the insurgents; but, the castle being stormed, Gaveston was made prisoner, and soon after brought to a short trial and beheaded, by Lancaster and others, the most violent of the faction, at Warwick. The sovereign was left to rage to the winds, his tears and menaces unavailing, few being so hardy as to join him in the proposed service; whilst the barons gained greater confidence from this bold but atrocious action, and now, sup∣ported by a powerful army, marched to the capital, to compel the king, by force of arms, to admit and perform the articles they had ordained, for the better go∣vernment of the state, demanding, at the same time, a general amnesty.</P>
<P>About the beginning of this prelate's episcopacy, a new race of marauders ap∣peared, who were called shevalds, a banditti of robbers, who came in troops from the mountains, and committed depredations on the villages. The bishop was very diligent in suppressing them; and one John de Wedale was slain by his soldiers in Holy Island, under the command of the bishop's brother. The king had taken great offence at the bishop, for not declaring himself publicly for him against the barons, and refusing to defend the unhappy favourite: He took possession of the circumstance of John de Wedale's death, and wrote to the pope letters of grievous accusation against the bishop, petitioning for his deprivation, or at least his tran∣slation to some less powerful bishopric; and at the same time attempted to bring the bishop's brother to execution, on a charge of blood, for the death of the rob∣bers, but failed in both.</P>
<P>Brus did not neglect to avail himself of the troubles which affected the northern parts of England. The bishop of Durham was obliged to be absent from his pa∣latinate on the accusations before-mentioned: Robert de Graystanes says, he was attending a parliament then held at London; but that is an error, no parliament being convened amidst the troubles and confusions of that year<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ang. Sac. p. 756.</NOTE>. About the middle of August, the Scottish army entered England, and burnt the towns of Hexham and Corbridge; whilst a detachment moved so secretly and with such ra∣pidity, as to surprise the inhabitants in their beds at Durham, and reduced the whole suburbs to ashes. They advanced to Hartlepool, which they sacked and plundered; and, on a composition of 2000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> (Graystanes says 1000 marks only) they spared the rest of the county from devastation, granting a separate truce till the Midsummer following, on condition that the Scottish army should march through the province, on any future expedition, without molestation. Northumberland and the other northern counties made a like composition<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="261" REF="308"/>
<P>The following year, a truce having been obtained by the intercession of the king of France, the king submitted to his barons, and assented to the general pardon demanded; on which the parliament granted large supplies for the Scottish war. The army led forth for this campaign (the relief of Stirling Castle being the first object) is spoken of by historians as the sinest body of troops ever commanded by the king of England in any service; said to have consisted of 100,000 men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Barbour.</NOTE>, of which 40,000 were horsemen, 3000 completely armed "with helyt horse in plate and mayl" for the front of the battle, and 52000 archers: Yorkshire furnished 4000 foot, Northumberland 2500, the bishopric of Durham 1500<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rymer, v. iii. p. 431.</NOTE> They were ordered to rendezvous at Berwick, and thence marched in ten divisions of ten thousand each. The writers of those times give a magnificent account of the mili∣tary parade and splendid shew of this vast armament; which, by injudicious mea∣sures, and an unpropitious fate attending a divided interest, the union between the king and his people being neither warm nor sincere, in opposition to a body of forces not exceeding 30,000, were put to the rout at the battle of Bannockburn, on Midsummer-day, A. D. 1314, and a dreadful carnage ensued<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The reader will sind a particular account of this battle in the View of Northumbetland.</NOTE>. It is not said what was the particular fate of the palatine troops, but the bishop's conduct on this occasion reinstated him in the royal favour: He not only supplied the stipu∣lated number of forces, but also presented to the king a free gift of 1000 marks with a gallant war-horse or charger of great price, which, being given to the earl of Gloucester, he was killed from off him in the engagement. Lord Clifford, who had Hartlepool in an arbitrary manner bestowed upon him on bishop Bek's dis∣grace, was also slain. The king, in consequence of their reconciliation, promised the bishop, that, if he survived, he should be restored to the territories of Barnard∣castle and Hartlepool. By the preceding circumstance it appears, that the plea of the military tenants of the bishopric was not supported; their serving at the battle of Bannockburn sufficiently proving that they were not entitled to any such immu∣nity as they claimed, but, as consistent with other military service, might be called to war in any part of the land.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the melancholy consequences of the satal defeat at Bannock∣burn, a new aid was granted in the parliament held at York, in the month of September following: But whilst the panic of the late victory prevailed in the minds of the English, and the languid powers of government slowly proceeded in measures to prosecute the war, the Scots pursued their advantage, and a large body of forces, led by Edward Brus and Sir James Douglas, over-ran Northumberland, and put the inhabitants of the palatinate under a heavy contribution, to save their country from a threatened desolation. The ravages of war were dreadful, but much more tremendous were the miseries of the encreasing famine; the calami∣ties attending which were so pressing, as to oblige the legislature to make a law for regulating the price of provisions, which, under the encreasing afflictions of ano∣ther year, was obliged to be repealed. Scotland could not escape this visitation:
<PB N="262" REF="309"/>That country, less calculated for tillage, experienced a greater want of bread, a quarter of wheat being sold for 100 shillings. To distress the inhabitants to the extreme, the English navy was employed in small squadrons on the coasts, to in∣tercept supplies from other countries; and proclamations were issued, prohibiting all persons, under severe penalties, carrying any kind of provision to the enemy: Such inhumanity prevailed in the barbarous politics of those times.</P>
<P>The king of France laboured much to effect a reconciliation between the powers at war; and Brus, shewing a willingness to accede to terms honourable to him∣self and his people, appointed ambassadors, and a congress was held at Durham: But king Edward obstinately refusing to acknowledge Robert Brus king of Scot∣land, and he, with a dignity derived from his military atchievements, persisting in his title to the crown, no terms were entered into by the delegates, and fresh ho∣stilities commenced; the king of France, whose mediation might have softened the arrogance of Edward, having departed this life during the negociation.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the calamities of the times, the Scottish army, in the spring of the year 1316, entered into England, sweeping away all kinds of provisions as they passed. The bishop of Durham and several of the northern barons were excused their attendance on parliament on this exigence. The Scots passed the western march, and penetrated into Yorkshire; from thence they entered the bishopric of Durham by the heights of Teesdale and Weredale, not daring to attack the for∣tress of Castle Barnard: They took their way so near to Durham, as to lay waste, plunder, and destroy the beautiful retreat of the monks at Beaurepaire, together with other places in the neighbourhood. They ravaged the country as far as Hartlepool, which place they plundered of all the effects they could find, the in∣habitants having saved the most valuable by putting them on board the vessels in the harbour, which on that occasion put out to sea. The wrath of the Scots seems particularly directed against this place, which had been wrested from their sove∣reign; the rest of the country purchased a respire and truce.</P>
<P>It was not till the month of November that any forces were sent into this part of the kingdom to oppose the Scots, when the lord Henry Beaumont and Adam de Winburn came into Northumberland. The bishop of Durham was commanded to raise his troops, and join this army; at the same time being discharged from entering into any separate truce for the suture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A.

For the greater security of the march, the bishop granted his Castle of Norham to be held and garrisoned by the king until the following Midsummer, the king saving to the church all possibility of prejudice from precedent in this
<PB N="263" REF="310"/>case. The depopulation of this part of the kingdom, by the famine, is spoken of in dreadful language by many authors; and it appears, by the foregoing fact, that the people of the palatinate were so much reduced, that it was thought expedient to save them the fatigue, and the province the expence, of garrisoning and victual∣ling this place of consequence and strength.</P>
<P>In the following year, the parliament held at Lincoln granted new supplies, in which the earl of Lancaster had the ascendency, was at the head of the council, determining all matters touching the further prosecution of this unprositable war, and was created the king's lieutenant and general of the army, for this service<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, v. iii. 535.</NOTE>: But nothing of moment was attempted this year. The rendezvous of miltary servants was suspended until the month of August, when the king came down to York, and from thence was prorogued till eight days after Michaelmas. The mi∣series consequent to war and famine were encreased in the northern parts to the greatest extremity. The repeated incursions of the enemy, and the cruel devas∣tations with which their progress was every where marked, together with a suc∣cession of three unfruitful years, brought the price of a quarter of wheat to forty shillings. Rapin's description of the famine is to this effect: <Q>Mean time the “famine raged in so terrible a manner, that one can hardly give credit to what historians say of it. They are not content with telling us, that the most loathed animals were used for food, but, what is much more horrible, people were forced to hide their children with all imaginable care, to prevent their being stolen and eaten by thieves. They assure us, that men themselves took precau∣tions to hinder their being murdered in private places, knowing that there were but too many instances that some had been served in that manner, to feed such as could find no other subsistence. We are told likewise that the prisoners in the gaols devoured one another in a barbarous manner; the extreme scarcity of provisions not permitting their being allowed necessary food. The bloody slux, caused by gross feeding, compleated the misery of the English: Such numbers ”died every day, that hardly could the living suffice to bury the dead.</Q></P>
<P>It is alledged, that Lancaster held a traiterous correspondence with Brus, court∣ing his friendship, in order that he might, by his aid, effect certain projects he had formed against the king; for as he was held in perpetual apprehension of his re∣sentment, for the part he had taken in Gaveston's destruction, so his sears grew into a settled aversion, which he studied to gratify.</P>
<P>Whilst the king remained at York, the bishop of Durham departed this life, on the 9th day of October, A. D. 1316, at his manor of Middleham, he having held the See little more than five years. He rebuilt the manor-house at Stockton upon a beautiful plan, and also the house called Le Wellhall, within 16 miles of York. His death was greatly lamented by the members of the convent, with whom his memory was held in great reverence. He had frequently promised to give to the church, at his death, his library, vessels of silver, and the surniture of his chapel; but the executors of his will, which he made during the extremity of sickness, immediately before his death on the 29th of September, thought proper to have
<PB N="264" REF="311"/>them disposed of in another manner. He ordered his remains to be interred above the steps in the chapter-house, near the prelate's seat, where his tomb was covered with a marble monument. On the day of his funeral, agreeable to his will, 100 marks were distributed to the poor. The king sent his almoner to attend the ob∣sequies, who honoured the remains with an offering of a pall of cloth of gold; the earl of Lancaster also presented three palls, richly embroidered with his arms, whereof vestments were afterwards made, in which the ministers officiated on so∣lemn days, when the convent wore white. The prelate's public conduct and cha∣racter have already been noted: His parentage is not known. He was a man of literature, and irreproachable morals; he supported his episcopal character with great dignity, untainted with pride; he was possessed of the powers of oratory and eloquence, which were rendered more striking and persuasive by his majestic figure and graceful deportment. The description Graystanes gives of him is elegant and expressive: "Vir utique sufficienter literatus, moribus &amp; vita dignus, cujus elo∣quentia species &amp; statura digna erant imperio."</P>

<P>In February 1743, Tho. Osborn, of Gray's Inn, London, published a sale catalogue of books and manu∣scripts in the Harleian collection, wherein was an ancient register of bishop Kellow, written on vellum, which he thus describes: "No. 20734. This is a large and valuable collection of charters, grants, letters, instru∣ments, &amp;c. by the kings, popes, archbishops, bishops, &amp;c. concerning the ecclesiastical privileges, prefer∣ments, &amp;c in the diocese of Durham, during part of the reigns of Edw. II. and III. that is, from the entrance of bishop Kellow upon the death of Anthony Bek, in 1310, 4th Edw. II. to the time of bishop Kellow's death, at Middleham, in 1316, as may be seen in fo. 265, where it is written, <HI>Explicit registrum cartarum de tempore R. Kellow.</HI> After which follows a charter of the franchise royal of the county palatine of Durham, also some pleas before the king's council in parliament, some charters relating to the barony of Gayneford and Barnardeastle, with some other like records concerning this See, or the bishops thereof, as far as fo. 283, where it is written, <HI>Hucusque Kellow, et hic finit.</HI> The latter part of the volume contains the register of Richard de Bury bishop of Durham, and contains the whole time that John de Wytchurch was his vicar∣general, and sometime beyond. It begins about the 5th year of Bury's consecration, anno 1338, and ends about the year 1342, two or three years before the said bishop's death. Between these registers are several lists bound up, containing an account of the ancient taxes of the churches in the archdeaconry of Durham, also the ordination of priests of several degrees, the times when, and places where, they were ordained by the said bishop Bury. The whole being a curious collection of antiquities, which might be very useful to illustrate the history of that See or of those bishops."</P>
<P>Mr Gough, in his Ancedotes of British Topography, v. i. p. 337, describes this book as follows; "In the Bodleian library, among the MSS. bequeathed thereto by the late Dr Rawlinson, is the original register of Richard Kellow bishop of Durham, being a thick parchment folio, of inestimable worth. It contains a great number of charters, grants, surveys, commissions, writs, &amp;c. issued or made by that prelate, together with several letters, writs, and commissions, sent into the bishopric by K. Edw. I. not only in the time of Richard de Kellow, but before and after, while it was in the hands of the crown, besides other records and instru∣ments of considerable value.</P>
<P>☞ I have been informed, that this register was borrowed out of the cursitor's office at Durham, by an agent of lord Oxford's, to produce as evidence relating to some of his estates in Northumberland, and that an accountable receipt was given for the same, and now remaining in the office.</P></NOTE>.</Q></P>

<P>The See of Durham now became the object of various interests. The earl of Lancaster interceded with the monks on the behalf of John de Kynardeslei his chaplain, and promised them, in case they elected him for their prelate, he would protect the palatinate from the Scots; an engagement he could no otherwise have fulfilled, than by means of the secret influence before intimated. The king, then at York, applied for Thomas de Charlton, a civilian, and keeper of the privy seal. The earl of Hereford wished to promote John Walwayne, a civilian; and the queen, with the most earnest solicitations, made every interest in her power for Lewis de Bellomonte, vulgarly Beaumont, who was at that time treasurer of Sa∣lisbury, a man of high birth and alliance, being descended of the royal blood of France and Sicily, the brother of Henry lord Beaumont, then in great power in England, and cousin to the queen. They were descended of Louis, son to Charles earl of Anjou, a younger son of Louis the Eighth, king of France. Louis was lord of Beaumont in France, and, by Agnes de Beaumont his lady, had the two sons above mentioned, and Isabel, the wife of the last of the Vescy's of Alnwick Castle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Barnes's King Edward III.</NOTE>. It is said the queen was so anxious for the success of this election, that there was scarce a monk in the convent who had not letters of application from their sovereigns. But the monks, who held themselves independent of every in∣fluence
<PB N="266" REF="313"/>but a spiritual intimation, and seldom inclined to obey a royal dictate, lest some innovation might creep in upon their privileges, on the day of St Leone, in consequence of the king's licence, they proceeded to election, and nominated Henry de Stamford prior of Finchale. Graystanes describes him a man of spotless character, full age, an agreeable person, of a chearful countenance, and sufficiently qualified in literature. Perhaps there never was an instance of such impotence of expectation, on the like occasion. Waiting the issue of the matter then agitated in the chapter-house, there were in the church the earls of Lancaster, Hereford, and Pembroke, and many other persons of consequence. Lord Henry Beaumont, with a great retinue, together with his brother, were also there; and Graystanes says, <Q>there were others there who threatened to smite off his head if he was elect∣ed.“”</Q> The king still remaining at York, would have confirmed the choice of the convent, had it not been for his queen, who seeing his inclination, fell on her knees, saying, <Q>my liege, I never yet asked any thing for my kindred; if you “bear me affection, grant me, that my cousin Lewis de Bellomonte be bishop of ”Durham.</Q> The king, overcome by this petition, refused his confirmation, and sent letters to the See of Rome in favour of Lewis. The bishop elect finding he could obtain no interest at court, and the chapter of York, afraid of the king's dis∣pleasure, not daring to grant their confirmation, the See being vacant by the death of William Grenfield, on a consultation of the convent, he agreed to travel to Rome; but, before his arrival, on the petition of the king and queen of England, and also of France, the pope gave the bishopric to Lewis; but, at the same time, imposed upon him so heavy a mulct, that, for the whole time of his episcopacy, he was not able to pay up the stipulated sums. By way of recompence to the bishop elect, against whom nothing could be justly objected, the pope gave him a grant of the priory of Durham, on the next vacancy; but he did not live to reap any benefit therefrom. Exhausted with the fatigue of the voyage, and the vexation of mind he had sustained, he reached the cell of Stamford, where he remained till a gradual decline brought on his dissolution. He departed this life on the day of St Gregory A. D. 1320, and was interred in the church of St Leonard, before the high altar. Graystanes says, a light was seen descending from heaven, like the rays of the sun, upon his tomb. He remarks, that he was born on the day of St Leonard, was elected on the festival of that saint, and was buried in the church of St Leonard.</P>
<P>In the year 1317, two cardinals came over into England, Gauselinus and Lucas, to promote a reconciliation between the belligerent powers, and if possible, to bring about terms of peace.</P>
<P>LEWIS BEAUMONT had the pope's bull for his collation to the bishopric of Durham, directing that he might receive consecration from whom and where he pleased. He was confirm∣ed at Westminster on the eleventh day of September, A. D. 1317; and thinking it would add to the magnificence of the ceremony to receive consecration from the
<PB N="267" REF="314"/>cardinals at Durham, who were on their way to Scotland, on the day of St Cuth∣bert, and to be enthroned the same day, he determined to accompany them into the north, lord Henry Beaumont making one of the party. When the com∣pany were advanced to Rushy-ford<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robert de Graystanes.—Ang. Sac. p. 750.

They robbed the cardinals and their attendants of all their valuables, but did not detain them, leaving them two horses to carry them to Durham. The lord Henry Beaumont and the bishop they made prisoners, and conveyed them to the Castle of Mitford, insisting on a heavy ransom for their liberty. It did not appear that these robbers were moved by principles of hatred to the bishop, or any na∣tional prejudices against the peace-makers, but that Middleton was determined to commit every outrage in his power, to express his resentment to the king for ar∣resting his cousin Adam de Swinburn, who had spoken too warmly to his sovereign touching the affairs of the marches. The north of England at that time abound∣ed with banditti, which took their rise from such associations as the calamities of the times had induced men to form for their mutual defence; but having long sub∣sisted by rapine, they contracted an evil habit, not easily abandoned; and at length, scorning distinctions between friend and foe, made a prey of whatever avarice or necessity tempted them to seize. Of such men Middleton's troop was said to con∣sist<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">For a description of Mitford Castle, and the fate of Middleton, vide View of Northumberland.</NOTE>. With those desperadoes he did much mischief in Cleveland, and reduced all the fortresses in Northumberland, except Alnwick, Bambrough, and Norham<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i. p. 558.</NOTE>. Graystanes says, in order to raise the money exacted for the bishop's ransom, the prior of Durham was obliged to sell the habits, plate, and jewels of the church. In this instance we see a great defect in the <HI>jura regalia</HI> of the palatinate, as those holding tenure under the bishop were not obliged to raise a subsidy for the purpose of their sovereign pontiff's ransom. Indeed several circumstances are observable, viz. that he had not received consecration, and was not enthroned, neither had he received restitution of the temporalities from the king, which constitute seisin of the see. The convent was at a great expence touching the cardinals, by whose autho∣rity only, it should seem, they could be induced to this sacrilegious use of the holy things of the altar, in favour of a prelate forced on them by the See of Rome. It appears that lord Henry Beaumont and the bishop were informed by a messenger
<PB N="268" REF="315"/>from the prior, that Middleton's marauding party was upon the road; but they were induced to despise the danger by a conceit that the king of Scotland, or those in his interest, dared not attempt any thing against them, armed as they were with the powers of the See of Rome, and that the prior meant to amuse them, as he might wish to impede Lewis's consecration.</P>
<P>The bishop being liberated on payment of the sum stipulated, he was consecrated at Westminster on the 26th day of March 1318; on the 4th of May he received re∣stitution of the temporalities from the king, and made profession to the archbishop of York, at Thorp, on the 19th day of June following.</P>
<P>The cardinals legates were not received in Scotland, as they did not bring powers with them acknowledging Robert Brus king; and, in consequence, their authority was treated with indignity and contempt. Their envoy or messenger was waylaid, robbed of the pope's bull and other instruments he had in charge, and sent naked to Berwick. This flagrant contempt of the pope's interposition to restore peace, doth not appear to be succeeded by any material acts of hostility, in that year, from either state: The opposition with which Lancaster and his con∣federates distressed the king, seem to fill up that period.</P>
<P>In the succeeding year, A. D. 1318, Berwick fell into the hands of the Scots by treachery, and Brus took up his residence in the castle. The possession of this strong place enabled his forces to reduce many of the fortresses of Northumber∣land; and, in destructive parties, they roved over the more southern parts, sacking and burning Northallerton, Boroughbridge, Ripon, Scarborough, and Skipton in Craven. How our palatinate fared, surrounded with those scenes of destruction, no historian has related: It was spared, and the exemption must have been procu∣red at a considerable expence. The legates, in consequence of the conduct of the Scots, pronounced the excommunication and interdict with which they were armed, against Brus and all his adherents; but this fulmination did not retard their mea∣sures; so that the king of England was obliged to summon his military tenants to attend him at York, and proceed in force against Scotland. A coalition of parties was effected by the legates, and Lancaster once more gained the ascendency in state affairs. The military operations were retarded by several accidents, so that it was thought expedient to disband the army which was assembled, and call into service all men north of Trent, from the age of 16 to 60, both horse and soot, to be regularly arrayed, and ready to take the field, under their respective leaders, in three days notice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

</LIST></NOTE>. This regulation kept the borders quiet during the winter,
<PB N="269" REF="316"/>and early in the summer, A. D. 1319, the king convened his parliament, when supplies were granted for this service; but it was September before the army was assembled near Berwick. Many of the chief nobility appeared in this armament, but we hear nothing of the bishop of Durham. A regular siege was formed to re∣duce Berwick, and many military engines then in use, and stratagems, were em∣ployed for that purpose. But, in the height of the attack, Lancaster withdrew his troops. At this instant an army from Scotland, composed of 10,000 veteran troops, entered England by the western march, and were near effecting their pur∣pose of surprising the queen at York, which obliged the king to raise the siege.</P>
<P>Soon after those events, a truce was agreed upon, and conservators were ap∣pointed for the northern counties, of whom four were named for Northumber∣land, viz. William Ridel, Gilbert de Burwedon, John de Penreth, and Roger de Horsely, whose charge, according to the tenor of their commission, was <Q>to keep “the truce, to hear all complaints of injuries, and inquire thereof by unsuspected ”men of the respective counties, and give judgment according to the articles of truce.</Q> It is observable, that, in this commission, we have the first correct description of the duty of a conservator of truce on the borders of the kingdoms that is to be met with on record. Commissioners were, in a short time afterwards, nominated by both powers to treat of peace, and a congress was held in consequence there∣of; but the extravagant demands of each nation rendered every effort of the commissioners abortive; and Lancaster's rebellion then breaking out, and his party professedly adhering to the interest of Brus, threw the state into new and most dan∣gerous distresses. By the assiduity and fortitude of Hartcla, who was then gover∣nor
<PB N="270" REF="317"/>of Carlisle, and commanded the forces of that district, Lancaster was valiantly opposed, and his progress stopped; and soon after ensued the battle of Borough∣bridge, where Hereford was slain, and Lancaster taken prisoner. His decapitation at Pontefract, and the universal dismay which succeeded the defeat, totally broke the faction.</P>
<P>Those prosperous circumstances induced the king to prepare for an expedition against Scotland, for which supplies were granted, and the king's military tenants were ordered to assemble at Newcastle on the 24th day of July, A. D. 1322. The king commanded the bishop of Durham to arm and array all the people of his palatinate, able to bear arms, between the ages of 16 and 60, as well for horse service as foot, to be ready to attend his summons and march against the Scots, out of the liberties of this province; for which he granted an indemnity, that no prejudice should arise by the precedent to his successors, and the rights of the church<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A.

After this the English forces ad∣vanced to Edinburgh, from whence they were driven back by famine; in their re∣turn wreaking their vengeance on the religious houses, and committing acts of sa∣crilege more barbarous than those of the savage nations in the eighth century; so little were the minds of men, in the course of five centuries, cultivated in their habitual ferocity, under all the benefits of revealed religion. Every effort Edward made was unpropitious: The hated administration of his favourites, the De Spen∣cers, clogged the wheels of government with dissatisfaction, and consequently with reluctant measures and services. They had an ascendency over the sovereign equal to that of Gaveston, and perhaps from the same species of influence. The queen entertained a mortal hatred to them. The Scots followed the heels of the king's retreating army, and a choice detachment, by an exertion of military ardour, had nearly surprised him at the abbey of Byland, in the north riding of Yorkshire. His flight was so precipitate, and the exigence so pressing, that he left his plate, equi∣page,
<PB N="271" REF="318"/>money, privy seal, and other regalia, a prey to the enemy, he escaping by Burlington to York. The county of Northumberland was compelled, by accu∣mulated distresses, to make a separate truce, which was obtained at a vast expence. Whether Durham was joined therein is uncertain, but most probably it was. A general truce soon after took place, and conservators were commissioned as before, Ralph de Nevil, and Roger de Horsley, for Northumberland. At a council held at Bishop-Thorp, near York, for settling terms of conciliation, Dugdale says<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, v. ii. p. 50.</NOTE>, the lord Henry Beaumont, though a baron of the realm, and sworn both of the great and privy council, as the record expresseth, being required to give his advice con∣cerning this truce, irreverently answered, <HI>that he would give no advice therein;</HI> whereat the king, in great anger, commanded him to depart the council; on which he went out, saying, <HI>he had rather be gone than stay;</HI> which expression gave such disgust, that, by consent of all the lords present, he was committed to prison; whereupon Hen. de Percy, and Ra. de Neville, became sureties for his appearance upon summons; and, soon afterwards, the king was reconciled to him. In the ratification of articles concluded in the truce, Richard de Emelden was joined with the two preceding commissioners, conservators.</P>
<P>The bishop of Durham's negligence and lukewarmness in the defence of his pa∣latinate, occasioned the king, whilst the truce was negociating, as a politic prepa∣ration against accidents, which might arise to frustrate its being carried into force, to issue his special writ for arming and arraying the people of the palatinate<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A.

<P>In the following year a war broke out between England and France, when the queen passed over to the continent to negociate a reconciliation; the result of which was the king's consigning, to his son Edward, the continental dominions, and impowering him to do the homage required by the king of France for the
<PB N="272" REF="319"/>same. This satal cession wrought the destruction of the unhappy monarch: The prince was made independent of his father, and the queen gained power to declare openly her detestation of the De Spencers, and hatred to the king for his adherence to them, vowing she would never return to England in peace, without they were removed from court, and their influence totally extinguished. This required force: A descent on the English coast was meditated: The malcontents were nu∣merous in England, and the old adherents of the Lancastrian faction were ripe for a revolt. The prince, under the influence of his mother, was contracted to Phi∣lippa, daughter of the earl of Hainault, and, from repeated rehearsals of her wrongs, and tainted with her thirst of revenge, he was induced to shake off his allegiance to his father, though then only 15 years of age. In September 1325, the queen, with a powerful armament, made a descent on the coast of Suffolk; and the king, as if become the contempt of mankind, and the mark of providen∣tial vengeance, saw himself immediately deserted by almost all his nobles, and even by his own brothers; the earls of Surrey and Arundel, the only two of the old nobility, remaining faithful to him. The De Spencers were seized, and executed as traitors; and the distracted sovereign, after lurking about some short time in the obscure parts of Wales, was made prisoner, compelled to resign his diadem, and, in the end, suffered an execrable death<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Walsingham's Hist. England, p. 127.—De la More's Life of Edward II.</NOTE>, by the hands of assassins: A hor∣rid tragedy, ascribed to the queen, and Mortimer her favourite. Thus ended the days of that weak prince, whose irresolution in matters of consequence, weak and indeterminate judgment, and obstinate adherence to favourites, who gratified his weakest and most disgraceful propensities, involved the state in the most dangerous calamities, and robbed her of those honours his father had purchased. He ascend∣ed the throne, surrounded with prosperity and glory, and left it immersed in mis∣fortunes and disgrace. The persecution and indignities this unfortunate monarch suffered in the close of royalty, and his cruel death, reflect great dishonour on the national character, and stamp the aera with infamy.</P>
<P>Edward having been compelled (whilst a close prisoner) to abdicate the throne, on the 13th of January A. D. 1327, prince Edward was proclaimed, and, on the first day of the following month, crowned king of England; his father not ma∣king his exit till the month of September in that year.</P>
<P>The Scots again appeared in arms, and summons were issued for the military tenants to assemble their whole service at Newcastle in the middle of May. A na∣val force was ordered to lie at the mouth of Tees, near Skinburness; and the king particularly requested, that the cities and great towns would furnish horsemen, mounted on cavalry of 30 or 40 shillings price. Negociations for a peace proved abortive: The king, with the royal family, came down to York: The Scots made an inroad about the middle of June, and were repelled. But this was a trivial bu∣siness to what immediately succeeded; for the earl of Murray and Lord Douglas, at the head of a large army, in which we are told were 24,000 horsemen, entered Cumberland in the month of July, and harrassed the western parts of Northum∣berland
<PB N="273" REF="320"/>and Durham, by the mountainous passes, which, from repeated incursions, they were well acquainted with. On the 15th day of July the king was at Durham, with an army of 100,000 men, and used every effort to meet with the enemy, but in vain. This immense multitude, encumbered with heavy baggage, could not pursue the Scots through the mountains and wastes which they traversed, and where every defile was known to them. After suffering innumerable hardships, without gaining a sight of the foe, a proclamation was issued, offering a reward of knight∣hood, and one hundred pounds in lands by the year, to any person who would con∣duct the king to a sight of his enemies, in a place where it was possible to give them battle. This was gained by Thomas de Rokeby, who discovered the enemy in Stanhope Park. The Scots left the field without engaging, and made a precipi∣tate retreat; the men in the rear threw away their arms for more expeditious run∣ning, of whom many were cut off by a party of light horse in the pursuit. The English army soon after was disbanded; but the Scots continued their military operations on the borders; took Norham, and made an unsuccessful effort upon Alnwick. Commissioners were appointed to treat of peace; during which nego∣ciation the king's nuptials were celebrated at York. By a royal mandate, directed to the bishop of Durham, the magistrates of Newcastle, and the sheriffs of Nor∣thumberland and Yorkshire, they were directed to give safe conduct and an ho∣nourable reception to the delegates of Scotland, said to be 100 in number, in their progress to York, on the treaty. The English parliament, assembled there in the month of March 1328, opened the way to a reconciliation, by consenting to a pre∣liminary deed of renunciation of the king's claim of sovereignty over Scotland, and a full recognition of Brus's title to the crown. In return, the states of Scot∣land engaged to pay into the king of England's exchequer 20,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a-year for three years, to indemnify England against the expences of the war: And the ar∣ticles of peace were ratified in due form.</P>
<P>In the following year, 1329, the king of Scotland died, leaving David his son and successor, an infant, little more than six years of age. The peace was strictly maintained whilst the insluence of the queen-dowager of England prevailed: But young Edward, possessed of great vivacity and spirit, together with strong mental powers, and a judgment singular for his years, soon grew impatient under the insolent despotism and atrocious conduct of Mortimer, and entertained thoughts of removing him. Sir William Montague, to whom the king communicated his wishes, warmly encouraged the idea; and a plan was secretly projected for seizing the obnoxious favourite in the Castle of Nottingham, where he resided totally un∣guarded, and without apprehension of danger. He was conveyed to London, im∣peached before parliament, and hanged at Tyburn. Lord Henry Beaumont, who had opposed the favourite in his flagrant acts of oppression, and was obliged to fly for safety into France, returned on this occasion. Soon after lord Henry's return, a complaint was made by the bishop of Durham, which he warmly supported, touching the village of Upsetlington, which was an ancient part of the territories of his See, and had been seized by the earl of March, in violation of the treaty of peace. It doth not appear that he received the desired redress; but circum∣stances
<PB N="274" REF="321"/>in this case, as in several others, threatened a breach of the harmony which subsisted between the two states, and were occasionally seized on by those who wished to disturb it. Lord Henry Beaumont was led by other motives than the redress of the See of Durham. Cummin fell by Brus's hand at Dumfries: He was grandfather of the earl of Athol: His large possessions in Scotland were held by the crown. Lord Henry Beaumont, by a series of fortunate incidents, had risen to great power; and he had made connections by which he entertained a sense of interests very foreign to his brother's palatinate. By marriage with one of the co-heiresses of the earl of Buchan, he succeeded to a share of the large pos∣sessions of that family, the earl's mother being one of the co-heiresses of the earl of Winchester. The earl of Athol married lord Henry's daughter, and had very opulent estates, and connections of the first consequence, in England. A secret desire to revenge the blood of Cummin, and recover his estates, apparently influ∣enced their future conduct. A full relation of the enterprize which those partisans projected, and put in execution, would be tedious and impertinent; it must suffice to say, the king of England publicly declared his disapprobation of hostile mea∣sures; and, when in open violation of the peace the confederates made a descent on Scotland, and in a series of victories gained an amazing progress in the coun∣try, he caused the estates of lord Henry Beaumont to be confiscated. But their successes, in a little time, assumed a countenance of the utmost importance; and the king, by the advice of his parliament, levied an army to move to the borders, there to act as occasion might call, for which the necessary supplies were granted. Whatever might be the king's private sentiments in the beginning of this affair, is hard to develope; but certain it is his ambition was now roused; the spirit of his grandsire seized his bosom; he shook off the principles of public faith and recti∣tude, for the promised glories of conquest, and a bloody war succeeded. Edward Baliol, who joined the invaders, and whose right to the crown they made their pretext for acts of hostility, to cover their baser principles, now assumed the title of king of Scotland, and entered into certain conventions with king Edward. Soon afterwards a parliament was assembled at York, where envoys appeared both from David Brus and Edward Baliol, when the conduct of the crown of England to∣wards the contending parties, and the states of Scotland, were deliberated upon, but no absolute resolution was formed. In the mean time it was thought expedi∣ent to treat with the guardians and nobles of David's party; to whom it was pro∣posed that he should do homage for his crown, and restore Berwick. Whether the court of Brus discovered the duplicity which darkens this part of the history, is un∣certain; but the propositions were rejected with disdain. Perhaps much of the spirit which the Scots displayed on this occasion, was owing to the misfortune which besel Baliol, who, being surprised in his quarters, escaped with great hazard of life into England, (half naked, on a horse without a saddle), over Solway frith. King Edward's soul had kindled with a slame not to be extinguished: His ambi∣tion was wakened with slattering hopes, and it was not suited to the habit of his mind to relinquish any favourite determination for one unpropitious circumstance. The year 1333 was ushered in by hostilities committed reciprocally by both nations,
<PB N="275" REF="322"/>supported by the determination of each state. Edward, to palliate his conduct, claimed to have received the aggression from the Scots. The English army was commanded to assemble at Newcastle on Trinity Sunday, and the military opera∣tions were opened by the siege of Berwick. The king of England, animated with all the ardour of an heroic mind, the sire of youth, and high ambition for the glory of arms, hastened to the scene of action. He was at Durham on the 1st of April, and there received Murray the guardian of Scotland, who was taken at Rox∣burg, but would not acknowledge himself prisoner to any but the king. The siege was tedious, and wearied the patience of king Edward so much, that whilst the approaches proceeded in a regular mode, with a detachment of the army he storm∣ed and took the Castle of Edinburgh, and penetrated Scotland as far as Scone, Dundee, and the neighbourhood of Dumbarton; and then returned before Ber∣wick, which still held out. The Scots levied a powerful army to relieve this im∣portant place, and the famous victory of Hallidon-hill<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For a full account of this battle and siege, vide View of Northumberland.</NOTE> ensued, on the 18th day of July 1333; after which Berwick was immediately surrendered to Edward's triumphant army. And Baliol, with a body of choice troops, flushed with suc∣cess, entered and reduced Scotland, and obliged David Brus to save himself by a hasty flight to France.</P>
<P>But to return to the affairs of this palatinate, and attend to the conclusion of bishop Beaumont's episcopacy. His interest was powerful; but, throughout the whole of his life, he appears to be in himself a very insignisicant character, both in church and state. Soon after the accession of Edward the Third, he prosecu∣ted his claim to the forfeited lands which Edward I. had severed from the palati∣nate; in which suit, the parliament, held in the first year of the reign, adjudged, That the bishop of Durham, within the liberties of his palatinate, was intitled to the forfeitures of war, in like manner as the king is intitled out of those liberties. The bishop proceeded by petition in the parliament at Westminster, before the king and council; setting forth, that he and his predecessors, time beyond me∣mory, had <HI>jura regalia inter aquas de Tine et Teese, et in Norhamshire et Bedling∣tonshire in com. Northumbrie, et cadem jura regalia per se et ministros suos proprios ibi∣dem exercuerunt et de omnibus et singulis infra aquas predict. et in pred. locis emergen. per se et ministros suos justiciam fecerint:</HI> Traversing that the king or his ministers intermeddle there but in default of doing justice: And setting forth, that he ought to have forfeitures of war there; and that his predecessor, bishop Bek, having caused Barnard Castle, upon the forfeiture of John de Baliol, and the manor of Hert and Hertness, upon the forfeiture of Robert Brus, to be seized, he held them peaceably for a time, until Edward I. caused him to be removed <HI>sine judicio ipso non vocato,</HI> pretending, that forfeitures there, as well as elsewhere, belonged to him; notwithstanding the charter made by Henry III. A ° 51. (1267) about Greatham, and therein recited; and setting sorth, that he could not have justice done him in several parliaments of Edward II. Whereupon the answers to divers of the bishop's petitions in that parliament, which were found, with other meno∣randums
<PB N="276" REF="323"/>touching the matter, in the king's treasury and chancery, being examin∣ed, and nothing found therein to exclude the bishop from having relief, the fol∣lowing judgment was given: <HI>Concordatum est per nos et totum concilium nostrum in dicto parliamento nostro quod predictus episcopus habcat libertatem suam de hujusmodi forisfacturis juxta tenorem et effectum carte proedict.

Edw. III. 1328, reciting the petition and judgment directed to Robert de Insula, then keep∣er of the forfeited lands and tenements, commanding him, <HI>Quod de terris et tene∣mentis infra e'patus libertatem predict. et in proedictis locis de Norhamshire et Bedling∣tonshire in manu nostra et in custodia vestra per forisfacturam guerre existen. manum nos∣tram amoventes vos de eisdem ulterius non intromittatis.</HI> The like writ was directed to <HI>Willo de Denn firmario quorundam terr. et ten. regi forisfact. in Bedlyngtonshire et Si∣manai de Grymesby tunc escaetori ultra Trentam.</HI> A writ dated the 24th Feb. was directed, <HI>Constabular.

<P>Complete justice not having been derived from the foregoing proceedings, the bishop exhibited another petition to the king and council in parliament, setting forth, that forfeitures of war had been adjudged to him in former parliaments, as the right of his church, and of his predecessors; and that thereupon writs had been awarded <HI>custodibus terrarum forisfact. infra regalem libertatem ipsius e'pi, quod <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anum regium inde amoveant:</HI> And stating, that Barnard Castle, the manor of Gainford, and other the late earl of Warwick's lands, and Hert and Hertness, which were Roger de Clifford's, and forfeited by John de Baliol and Robert de Brus, were detained in the king's hands, as if, by reason of that forfeiture, the king might use his prerogative within the liberty of Durham as elsewhere within his kingdom, <HI>que quidem prerogativa ad ipsum episcopum infra libertatem proedictam pertinet sicut dicet;</HI> and praying, that the king would command the keepers of the said lands, <HI>quod manum regiam de terris illis sicut de aliis amoveant,</HI> and suffer him to use and enjoy his said liberty, <HI>ubi breve regis de jure currere non debet</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The true meaning of <HI>breve domini regis non currit</HI> is, that the court of king's bench cannot write directly to the sheriff, as they do in other cases.

<P>The bishop's private character is singular; and, by the historians who have mentioned him, is variously represented, and with much inconsistency. He was
<PB N="280" REF="327"/>of exalted birth, was well favoured in his countenance, but crippled and lame of both his feet, and a miserable figure for the pontifical dignity. He was strictly continent, but in his other manners wholly laical. As bishop of Durham, com∣manding that important province, in the busy reigns in which he presided, he ap∣pears in no commissions of consequence; which is a sufficient proof of his want of capacity. Halt and maimed (as he was), he could not lead his own troops to the field, the lord Henry Beaumont being their commander when called into service. There are instances to be collected of his imbecility of mind; and it is much to be doubted he had few endowments to boast; the blood of royal progenitors being his only honour. He shewed himself, on every occasion, eager after riches, grasp∣ing at gold, yet, like a child, not assiduous to purchase the toy which had his affections: The passion seemed totally dissimilar in him from that which agitates the rest of mankind: The love of money did not bring with it the ordinary anxie∣ties for its attainment; but, more than that, with his avarice he coupled a prodi∣gality truly singular, insomuch that, it is said, he was frequently reproached with his diligence as well to accumulate as to squander his riches. He was particularly severe upon the convent of Durham, using all the devices of his restrained capa∣city to squeeze from their coffers the money he wished for. Under a colourable representation of the impoverished state of his episcopal revenue, by the Scottish war, he obtained a bull to appropriate to himself a fourth part of the revenues of the house so long as the war subsisted. He had not common gratitude; for when the prior and convent were his sureties for 3000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> to certain merchants, which they bound themselves to pay on the bishop's default, he accounted them little thanks. Though the prior made him frequent presents of horses, and other things of value, he received them with an affected air of supercilious negligence. The speech the historian records to be made by him, is sufficiently expressive to give the reader a full estimate of the powers of his mind: <HI>Nil facitis pro me, nec ego faciam pro vobis; orate pro morte mea, quia dum vixero, non obtinibitis.</HI> The plain sense of which may be deduced from the wranglings of children at play; <Q>If you “won't meddle with me, I won't meddle with you; you may wish for my being
<PB N="281" REF="328"/>”gone, for you'll be no better whilst I stay<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rob. de Graystanes.—Ang. Sac. p. 761.
<P>The circumstance in bishop Beaumont's character, that he was very avaricious, and at the same time very expensive, is not an uncommon one, nor is it difficult of observation. It occurs so evidently with regard to some persons, that it cannot well escape any attentive mind. Hence I have often imagined, that there is not that great merit, in point of penetration and acuteness, which hath sometimes been ascribed to the <HI>al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> appetens, sui prosusus,</HI> of Sallust. The character of Catiline is, indeed, finely drawn, and the particular ex∣pression is just, picturesque, and beautiful; but the thought is obvious. Sallust could not avoid it in his de∣lineation of that famous conspirator; nor did it escape the notice of Cicero, who, in his admirable descrip∣tion of this incendiary, in his oration for Caelius, says, <HI>Quis in rapacitate avarior? Quis in largitione ess<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/></HI>—Robert de Graystanes, though neither a Cicero nor a Sallust, could perceive the union of covetousness and extravagance in bishop Beaumont.

It is no wonder so truly an unlevitical figure, and a man of so weak a capacity, should have great dif∣ficulty in obtaining his appointment from the See of Rome. The corruption of the apostolical character, in this instance, carries an idea to the heart of the histo∣rian, which freezes up the channels of charity. Immense bribes, and the interest of the powerful crowns of England and France, were combined to strangle all true religion and virtue. What a despicable appearance this episcopal object made at the time of his consecration! He understood nothing of the Latin tongue, the historian says, and proves that he had not the pronunciation of a word of six syllables; for, when he attempted to read in public, the bull for this sacred office, which he had been taught to spell for several days together, he could not utter it intelligibly; so that when he came to the word <HI>metropolitice,</HI> and hammered over it in vain for a considerable time, he cried out in his mother tongue, <HI>Soit pour dict.</HI> "Let us supppose it read." Well might Graystanes (wounded for the church) exclaim, <Q>the melancholy circumstances astonished the congregation, who, for “”the sake of religion, secretly lamented that such a wretch should receive conse∣cration.</Q> But to proceed: In going on with this instrument, impatient of an intolerable task, where even a fool would have blushed in his consciousness of in∣capacity, when he came to the words <HI>in aenigmate,</HI> he could not proceed one jot; but, with a vacant grin, which was intended to express facetiousness, he exclaim∣ed, <HI>Par Saint Lewis, il n'est pas curtois qui ceste parolle ici escrit;</HI> <Q>By St Lewis “”it is not courteous that this word is written here.</Q> Enough! Enough!</P>
<P>Graystanes, speaking of the bull for appropriation of a part of the conventual revenue, and another as iniquitous, says, <HI>Noluit ejus consilium eis uti.</HI> This sentence naturally leads to a review of the badges of regality with which this palatinate was endowed. The records referred to before, touching restoration of the forfeitures of war, rehearsing the matter, and speaking of the palatinate, say, <Q>where our “”writ of right ought not to run<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide preceding record, the note to p. 277.</NOTE>, or we make seizure of forfeited lands,</Q> but that the bishop have his royal franchise, as it was granted by Hen. III. which is a solemn confirmation of the <HI>jura regalia</HI> of the palatine of Durham. Speaking
<PB N="282" REF="329"/>of the palatine powers, the bishop had anciently his thanes, and afterwards his barons, who held of him by knight's service; and that, on public occasions, when his province was in danger, he called them together, the Editor of Camden says, <HI>in the nature of a parliament,</HI> to advise and assist him with their persons, depend∣ents, and money, for the public service, either at home or abroad. But the fore∣going is the first instance that has occurred of the interposition of the bishop's council in any public matter. Near the close of life, the bishop was about to ap∣propriate the church of Elwick to the convent, but died before it was effected. He gave to them a moiety of Edmundbyers. He built a kitchen, and also a spacious and complete hall and chapel at Middleham, but did not live to see them finished<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Angla Sacra, p. 761.</NOTE>. He is said to have rebuilt the walls of Durham, which were much gone to decay. It is not improbable he was led to this important work by the process of Edw. II. before noted, in which he was reproached for neglecting the defence of his pro∣vince. He died suddenly at Brantingham, in the diocese of York, on the 24th day of September, A. D. 1333, having sat fifteen years. He was interred near the high altar in the cathedral church at Durham, having in his lifetime prepared his tomb-stone, highly ornamented with his effigy in brass, and round him, the portraitures of the twelve apostles, inscribed with an epitaph, expressive of <HI>all the merit</HI> he had in life<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In Browne Willis's Cathedrals, we have it thus:

<P>Mr Noble says, <Q>This prelate copied the example of “bishop Bek in putting his family arms upon his money, which were as in the margin.

The legends on the obverse are, EDWA. or EDWAR. R. ANGL. DNS. HYB. On the re∣verse, they read CIVITAS DUNELM; and, pro∣bably, some have the name of the city of Durham wrote otherwise, as, during this and the preceding reign, we have upon the

<P>Galfrid de Burdon, who was elected prior in the year 1313, resigned in the year 1332, having assigned to him for maintenance the cell of Weremouth, with the tithes of that vill, and of Fullwell.

<P>Licence having been obtained for the election of a prelate, the convent dele∣gated a certain number of the fraternity for making choice of a proper person to sill the See; who, on the 15th day of October, nominated Robert de Graystanes, the author to whose writings such frequent recourse has been had in this narrative, who had the degree of Doctor of Divinity, and was then sub-prior of Durham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rob. de Graystanes.—Ang. Sac. p. 762.</NOTE>. He was unanimously approved by the convent, and received the metropolitan's let∣ters proclamatory accordingly. On his application to the king for the royal as∣sent, he was told by his majesty, that he understood the pope had ordained Richard de Bury, his domestic chaplain, to the bishopric of Durham; that he was very unwilling to give offence to the sovereign pontiff, and therefore could not assent to his election. It appeared, that the king had not only applied to the pope in Bury's favour, but also wrote to the convent to request his election. The bishop elect returned to York, where, after having held a consultation with the canons of the church there, and having obtained consent from the prior and convent of Durham, notwithstanding the refusal of the royal assent, he says himself he received confirma∣tion on the 4th of the ides of December; but Wharton, in his notes, on the 10th of November, in the church of St Mary's at York; and on Sunday following, being the 8th of the kalends of December, or, according to Wharton, on the 14th day of November, he was consecrated in the chapel of the archbishop's palace, by the archbishop, the bishops of Carlisle and Armagh assisting at the ceremony; and, on the Sunday following, he was enthroned at Durham. Having professed obedi∣ence, as usual, he applied to the king for restitution of the temporalities; but he was refused admittance to the presence, receiving a message by the treasurer, that as it was not customary in England for any bishop to receive consecration, or be confirmed without the royal assent, in a matter so unprecedented, and of such consequence, he would give no answer without being fully advised therein, and therefore would lay it before his next parliament. Soon afterwards, RICHARD DE BURY came to Durham, bearing the pope's bull, the royal letters of confirmation, and due process for restitution of the temporalities, and was immediately received. The archbishop of York, having had an inspection of those instruments, wrote to the clergy and people of Durham, that they should pay obedience to the nomi∣nee. The Melton Register says, he confessed the consecration of Graystanes was performed in perfect ignorance of the pope's appointment. Bishop Bury's nomi∣nation bore date the 14th day of October, A. D. 1333; he was consecrated the
<PB N="285" REF="332"/>19th day of December following; was installed, by proxy, on the 10th day of January 1334, and enthroned, in proper person, the 5th day of June following. He made profession of obedience on the 12th day of February, A. D. 1337. The convent did not think it expedient to litigate this matter, notwithstanding many favourable circumstances appeared on Graystanes' behalf, as the grievous expences attending such a suit did not then befit the exhausted state of the conventual trea∣sury, drained as it was by the injuries and losses sustained by the Scottish war; so that they thought it more prudent, in this instance, to submit to the higher pow∣ers implicitly, than contend against an influence which promised to overthrow the justest pretensions they could plead<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rob. de Graystanes.—Ang.

<P>The learned monk did not submit with that religious resignation one would have expected from a man of such an enlarged mind, and extensive understanding. The bane of ambition had long disturbed the tranquillity of the cloister; and desire of greatness been habited with the humble attire of the cowl. The anxiety of mind, derived from disappointed hopes, brought this valuable man to a hasty dissolu∣tion<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He was buried in the Chapter-house, with this inscription:
<Q><L><HI>De Graystanes natus, jacet hic Robertus humatus,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Legibus armatus rogo sit sanctis sociatus.</HI></L></Q></NOTE>. Religion, virtue, learning, vows of self-denial, and resistance of the passions, could not shield him from the same venom which poisons the felicity of those without the doors of the convent.</P>
<P>The bishop was born in or near Edmundsbury in Suffolk, in the year 1281, 9th Edward I. and was known more publicly from the place of his birth, than the fa∣mily name of Aungerville. His father, Sir Richard Aungerville, knight, dying whilst he was young, his uncle John de Willoughby, a priest, took the charge of his education; and after he was sufficiently instructed at a grammar school, sent him to finish his studies at Oxford, where he made a distinguished progress in phi∣losophy and divinity, and gained great esteem for his learning and exemplary life<NOTE PLACE="‡">Biog. Brit. new edit. v. i. p. 770.</NOTE>. When he left Oxford he became a Benedictine monk at Durham; and, soon after, from the public character he had, for virtues as well as erudition, he was made preceptor to prince Edward, afterwards Edward III. In 1325, being treasurer of Guienne, when the queen refused to return to England, on account of the bane∣ful influence of the De Spencers, he supported her and the prince with large sums of money out of that exchequer, for which being questioned by some of the king's partizans, it became necessary to his safety to abscond. He fled to Paris, and, be∣ing pursued by the king's lieutenant with an armed party, narrowly escaped, and concealed himself for seven days in the tower of the church of the Friers Mi∣nores<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. When Edward the Third came to the crown, he loaded his preceptor with honours and preferments. He at first made him his cofferer, then treasurer of the wardrobe, archdeacon of Northampton, prebendary of Lincoln, Sarum
<PB N="286" REF="333"/>and Litchfield; afterwards, keeper of the privy seal, which latter office he held five years, and was in that time sent twice ambassador to the pope. On the first audience he was received with the favour due to his distinguished learning and virtues. He was appointed first chaplain of the pope's chapel, and was presented with a rochet in the place of a bull for the first vacant bishopric in England. At that time he possessed English benefices to the value of 5000 marks a year. On the second audience, he had certain powers granted him touching the promotion of clerks, and was allowed, whenever he approached the presence of the pope or cardinals, to be attended with twenty clerks, dressed in uniform vestments, and 36 esquires, also in uniform. On his return from this second embassy, he was in∣formed whilst in France of the death of bishop Beaumont, and of the king's let∣ters to the See of Rome for his promotion to the bishopric; at which, it is said, he was much grieved; and when William de Tykell, rector of Stanhope, men∣tioned his sending letters to the cardinals, and others, in his interest, to obtain the vacant bishopric, he answered with warmth, that he would never consent to any such applications for this or any other See. In 1333 he was promoted to the deanry of Wells, and, as mentioned before, in the same year, appointed bishop of Durham. He was consecrated on Sunday preceding the birth-day of his 46th year, by John Stratford archbishop of Canterbury, in the abbey of the black ca∣nons of Ceertsey in Surrey. He was soon afterwards enthroned at Durham, on which occasion he made a grand festival, and entertained, in the hall of his palace at Durham, the king and queen of England, the queen-dowager of England, the king of Scotland, the two metropolitants, and five other bishops, seven earls, with their ladies, all the nobility north of Trent, with a vast concourse of knights, esquires, and other people of distinction, among whom were many abbots, priors, and other religious; also an infinite multitude of the commonalty were en∣tertained<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ang. Sac. p. 765.—Blog. Brit. v. i. p. 370.</NOTE>. The next year he was appointed high chancellor, and, in 1336, treasurer of England.</P>
<P>Amidst all the confusion of the war with Scotland, our bishop is not named. Various were the events which attended the military operations of both nations, and the borders were imbrued in blood: But the bishop's character was not mili∣tary: He was not at the head of his provincial troops, but served more essentially in the cabinet. Edward Baliol was raised to the throne of Scotland, but it was an exaltation coupled with a vassalage, which soon grew intolerable. The English lords who had possessions in Scotland, in consequence of the concessions made on Baliol's accession, soon assumed an arrogance not to be endured; and the new settlement was very early thrown into distraction; on which Brus's party again ap∣peared in great force in various parts of the kingdom. Whilst matters were in this troubled state in the north, the bishop of Durham, with the bishop of Win∣chaster, were sent ambassadors to the king of France, to treat about a croisade, then in agitation, and which was promoted some time before by pope Benedict; and also to treat of peace between England and Scotland. But hostilities were
<PB N="287" REF="334"/>not suspended. The war was prosecuted the following year, and many advantages were gained against Baliol's party. In the year 1338, the bishop of Durham was twice on embassy to France, but without effecting the terms of peace he was sent to obtain. In this year the king passed over to the continent, with a large armament, to obtain redress of injuries by force of arms; and in his absence the war with Scotland was feebly maintained. He did not return to England till the year 1340. In this year the Scottish army advanced to the environs of Durham, marking their progress with the usual depredations and ruin. A truce was made with France, in which Scotland, as an ally, was included, which put an end to the raging of the border was for some time; and a second truce with the Scots succeeding, it was not till after the return of David Bruce and his queen to Scotland from their exile, in the year 1342, that hostilities were renewed. In the last truce, the bishop of Durham was joined in commission with Henry of Lancaster, the earl of Derby, and others, dated 3d April<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. v. p. 306.

</LIST></NOTE>. From the authority of Froissard, l. i. c. 75. the author of the Border History has said, <Q>that David's resentment of his own grie∣vous “treatment, joined to the bitter complaints made by his subjects of their suf∣ferings from the English, prompted him to engage without delay in the work of seeking revenge, and obtaining reprisals for past losses and injuries. His sub∣jects fondly flocking around his standard, he set out from Perth at the head of
<PB N="288" REF="335"/>a numerous army (60,000 foot and 3000 horse), and, entering England by the eastern border, wasted and spoiled, far and wide, the counties of Northumber∣land and Durham. He laid siege to Newcastle, which was defended with such vigour by Sir John Neville, that he was soon obliged to retire from it. He marched from thence to Durham, which city he besieged and took, and there gave a full vent to his revenge against the English, sparing neither sex nor age, priests nor sacred edifices. The king of England seems not to have expected, or not to have had timely intimation of this attack of king David upon his do∣minions; for there was no force near the march able to resist this sudden and formidable invasion. As the Scottish army was returning homewards with great loads of plunder, they passed in sight of the Castle of Wark. This fortress be∣longed at that time to the earl of Salisbury; his countess resided in it, and his brother, Sir William Montague, was governor. The indignation of the garri∣son being excited at seeing the spoils of their country carried off with impunity, a part of it, consisting of 40 horse, with their governor at their head, sallied suddenly forth, and attacking the rear of the Scottish army, killed 200 of them, ”and carried 160 horses, laden with booty, into the Castle.</Q> The editor of that history, in a note, has corrected this erroneous account; <Q>the taking of Durham, “and the cruelty and sacrilege David committed there, must be a mistake; for, as Tyrrell observes, there is no mention of any thing like it, either in the Scot∣tish ”or English historians, in manuscript or in print.</Q></P>
<P>The chancery rolls of bishop Bury being extant, and perfect, and other records in his time better preserved than those of any of his predecessors, there is, in the Durham archives, a more perfect series of acts of jurisdiction of this than of any preceding aera.</P>
<P>The bishops of Durham, by their <HI>jura regalia</HI> before observed upon, held a court of wards and liveries, and had an escheator and feodary, until the act of parlia∣ment, made in the 12th year of Charles II. (1661), ch. 24. took away wardships throughout the whole kingdom. Of the exercise of this jurisdiction, there are many records in our bishop's time; of which a few are noted for example sake<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Diem clausum extremum.</HI>—Sched. 13.

He frequently corresponded with Petrarch, and had for his chaplains Thomas Bradwardin and Richard Fitz-Ralph, afterwards archbishops, the first of Canterbury, the second

Killington, doctors of divinity, the most eminent men in that age. His custom was to have some of his attendants read to him whilst he was at meals, and when they were over, to discourse with his chaplains upon the same subject. He was likewise of a very bountiful and charitable temper; every week he made eight quarters of wheat into bread, and gave it to the poor. Whenever he travelled between Durham and Newcastle, he distributed eight pounds sterling in alms; be∣tween Durham and Stockton, five pounds; between Durham and Auckland, five marks; and between Durham and Middleham, five pounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">W. de Chambre.—Ang.

<P>He affected much to retain in his family the sons of gentlemen of the province, and he cultivated with great attention the friendship of men of fortune in his bi∣shopric. The members of the convent he held in the highest veneration: It is said, as he sat one day at table in York, with seven earls, one Mr John Vaughan suddenly came in upon them, with the news of Robert Graystanes' death; which affected the bishop so much, that he could not bear to look upon the messenger: When the company enquired of him why the intelligence gave him so much emo∣tion, "Certain am I," said he, "if you had known this man's merit as well as I do, you would have lamented his death equally with me;" and added, "he was fitter for a prelacy than I, or any one I know who enjoys that dignity in the church."</P>

<P>A short vacancy took place in the See: The critical situation of public affairs induced the king to supply the important office of palatine with all possible expedi∣tion; and it was effected in a manner which reflected much dishonour on the sove∣reign. The exercise of papal authority over ecclesiastical benefices in England, had long been considered a great grievance to the state, and incompatible with the interests of a people rising rapidly in wealth and power, and making progressive advances to a perfect state of liberty. The council had repeatedly opposed such authority; the king had issued frequent mandates for repressing the instruments of the See of Rome; and several laws were enacted to extinguish the pope's jurisdic∣tion over ecclesiastical preferments: Yet, notwithstanding, the king, to carry his wished-for appointment to the See of Durham, made a flagrant innovation of all those solemn acts of state, by applying to the pope in favour of his secretary and keeper of his privy seal, THOMAS HATFIELD.</P>
<P>The pope, who had observed the conduct of the British senate with much con∣cern, foreseeing that it would produce, in a series of years, a total exclusion of his supremacy in that powerful kingdom, received the king's application with much cordiality, cherishing an innovation which flattered the See with new vigour, and suspended the growth of that inimical authority which he had contemplated with much anxiety. He immediately fulfilled the king's request, and sent a provision for Hatfield<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Angl. Sac.</NOTE>. It is not said that this measure of the sovereign occasioned any commotion in the council; the season was filled with complicated business, and affairs of the highest moment soon after ensued, to engage the energy and exertion of every member of the state. Walsingham says, this application was the greatest disgrace to the king, after provision had been made by the legislature to secure free elections. Many of the cardinals spoke very disrespectfully of Hatfield, as being a man of levity and laical manners: But the pope, from the motives before men∣tioned, being determined to grant the king his pleasure, replied, "truly, if the king of England had made interest for an ass, he should have been gratified." This does not give the reader the most favourable impression touching the prelate whose history he is advancing to: But Walsingham appears to write on this mat∣ter with rancour, and therefore gives less prejudice than a more temperate histo∣rian. Chambregrave; doth not take the least notice of this transaction, but goes on to say, a day was appointed for electing a prelate by the convent, and, on the 8th
<PB N="300" REF="347"/>day of May, 1345, Hatfield was chosen: He had confirmation on the first day of June, received restitution of the temporalities the succeeding day, was consecrated on the ninth day of July, and enthroned on Christmas-day next following, by John Fossour, the prior<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bishop Hatfield was second son of Walter de Hatfeld, of Hatfeld in Holderness, in the county of York, knight. Godwin takes very unbecoming liberties with this bishop, and says, that he was not only a mere layman, but a man of light behaviour; meaning, that he did not demean himself as a clergyman ought to do, which words have been misconstrued by other writers, who supposed him a mere layman indeed; but he was not only a clergyman, but a man of spirit and a warrior. He was prebendary of the prebends of Ox∣gate in Middlesex <HI>circa an.</HI> 1320, and in 1332 was admitted to the rectory of Dibden in Essex, by the pre¦sentation of his relation and patron John de Bohun earl of Hereford, which he resigned in 1336. Had the bishop been a man of such light behaviour as Godwin pretends, K. Edward, who it is universally allowed was both a wife and good prince, would never have heaped so many and great honours upon him as hath been mentioned. He served Edward in his wars in France, and was at the taking of Calais. His retinue and quota in the field were very considerable, being 3 bannerets, 48 knights, 164 esquires, and 80 archers on horseback; and on his banner were displayed the paternal arms of his family, viz. ermine, a chevron sable, impaled with the See of Durham.—Collier's Ecc. Hist. vol. i. p. 572.—Brady, &amp;c.
<P>It appears that the arch bishop of York, in this prelate's time, was renewing the ancient claim of the me∣tropolitans visiting in this diocese: The following curious records totally extinguish the pretences to such a right, and are the strongest evidence of the palatine jurisdiction and <HI>jura regalia,</HI> by the ample admissions of the crown.</P>

<P>Notwithstanding Edward's threat, "that he would reduce Scotland to such de∣struction as should be remembered whilst the world endured,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Barnes, p. 268.</NOTE>" a truce took place for the term of two years. The Scots, whose politics seem in this aera to be calculated to amuse, without any degree of public faith, violated the articles of treaty, as soon as a favourable occasion offered. In the autumn of 1345, the French king instigated an irruption on the western borders, in hopes of diverting the progress of the English army, with which he was then sore pressed. The Scots entered Cumberland with a large force, under the command of Sir William Douglas, and laid in ashes the city of Carlisle and town of Penrith, with all the intermediate villages; but their progress was stopped by the English forces collect∣ed by the bishop of Carlisle, Sir Tho. Lucy and Sir Robert Ogle, who obliged them to retire precipitately into their own country.</P>
<P>The following year yielded more laurels to the crown of England than had been acquired by any sovereign, in any aera of its history. In the month of August was fought the memorable battle of Cressy, in which prince Edward, (called, from his armour, the Black Prince) a youth in his 17th year, displayed such heroic intre∣pidity and military skill, as claimed the admiration of all Europe. The glorious victory of Cressy was almost immediately succeeded by the victory over the Scots, at the Redhills near Durham, vulgarly known by the title of <HI>The Battle of Nevil's Cross.</HI> The king of France had again used his interest with David king of Scotland to make a diversion in his favour, in order to draw the king of England's atten∣tion from the siege of Calais, which he had opened with an ardour that threatened its destruction; and for this purpose a large supply of men and money was imme∣diately sent into Scotland. The king of England, jealous of some attempt of this nature, sent his commissioners to David, offering advantageous terms of compro∣mise, part of which consisted of a proposed resignation of the town and castle of Berwick. The states of Scotland contended warmly for an acceptance of the terms; but David, fired with more ambitious views, and spirited up to war by the influence of France, the absence of the king, and the exhausted state of Eng∣land, as to men, (Edward having carried abroad with him the flower of the Eng∣lish youth) he convened a parliament at Perth, and received their sanction for his projected invasion. He levied a large army, by most historians computed at 50,000 men, with which, in the beginning of October, he entered England by the western borders. The small tower of Liddel felt the first fury of his arms, where the brave garrison, on surrendering, were put to death with all the determined barbarity of inhuman savages. He made his way through Cumberland, which smoaked in ashes as he passed; and, by the south-west parts of Northumberland, approached the city of Durham, and encamped at Beaurepaire. Notwithstanding the panic with which the country was struck, at a period when the king was absent,
<PB N="302" REF="349"/>with the generals of most experience, and the country stript of military men, the northern potentates raised an army with all possible expedition to oppose the inva∣ders, whose conduct had proclaimed, that sacking, plundering, and every species of barbarity, were their determined purpose. The archbishop of York, the bishop of Durham, (who on this occasion displayed the provincial standard, the banner of St Cuthbert), the bishops of Lincoln and Carlisle, the lords Neville, Percy, Hastings, Angus, Mowbray, and Roos, the titular king of Scotland (Edward Ba∣liol), Sir Tho. Rokesby, and the sheriff of Northumberland, at the head of an army of 16,000 men, obtained a complete victory on the 17th day of October, and took the king of Scotland prisoner, at the place before mentioned. Robert, high steward of Scotland, has been charged, by several writers, with treachery on this occasion; as he and the earl of March, with their retainers, returned imme∣diately to Scotland after the battle, with very little loss of men. The blow was a severe one to the Scots; they were deprived of their sovereign, and consequently thrown into intestine distraction; the chief body of their troops was cut off or ta∣ken prisoners, for the loss of the field was horridly aggravated by the slaughter made by Baliol in the retreat: Pursuing the advantages, he penetrated a great way into Scotland, and reduced several important places to the English arms.</P>
<P>The king of England received the intelligence of this victory before the walls of Calais. Copeland, to whom the king of Scotland surrendered himself prisoner, was summoned by the queen to resign him to her disposal, which he with intrepi∣dity refused, having him safe in the castle of Ogle, of which he was then governor; alledging he would give up his charge to no one but the king of England. Not∣withstanding the queen's dispeleasure at this denial, the king received Copeland with great cordiality, and granted him a reward suitable to the important service.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

<P>After the surrender of Calais, a truce took place between England and France, in which Scotland, as an ally, was included; and, during that stay of hostilities, a treaty was entered into for the redemption of the captive king. Although the most dreadful plague raged that ever this island experienced, in defiance of the terms of the truce, many incursions, by plundering parties, harrassed the borders for a considerable time, till at length, in the progress of military movements by the Scots, the town of Berwick was surprised.

<PB N="303" REF="350"/>Durham on the 23d day of December, A. D. 1356; from thence he issued a sum∣mons to all the military tenants of the realm to attend him on the first day of Ja∣nuary at Newcastle; from whence marching soon afterwards, he reduced Berwick. On his advancing into Scotland, Edward Baliol made a formal surrender of his crown and kingdom to him at Roxburgh, by delivering the diadem and some of the soil of the land, as was the practice of those times. The several instruments made on this occasion are witnessed by the bishop of Durham, who attended the king on this expedition. The following year was rendered glorious in the annals of Edward's reign, by the signal victory obtained by the Black Prince at Poictiers, in which the king of France was taken prisoner. It was not until the month of October in this year that the treaty was concluded with Scotland, for the redemp∣tion of king David: In the commission for this important negociation the bishop of Durham was joined with the bishop of Carlisle, and the lords Neville, Scroop, and Musgrave.</P>
<P>The king of Scotland did not enjoy the restitution of his liberty for any conside∣rable time; he departed this life in the month of February, 1371, and, having no issue, by virtue of the settlement of the crown made by Robert Brus, his nephew Robert was his successor, the first of the royal line of Stuarts.</P>
<P>The disturbances on the borders, in the remaining part of Edward's reign, were not momentous enough to claim a place here. The progressive misfortunes which befel the English court shed their influence over the whole state, and for a considerable space of time a melancholy dispiritedness and dismay locked up the active powers of the subject. As if Providence had decreed to dash the most ex∣alted human glory with the greatest bitterness, this illustrious monarch, towards the conclusion of his life, suffered some of the heaviest asslictions human existence could be conceived to sustain. He lost the affectionate partner of his throne in the year 1369, with whom he had lived for near 42 years in a state of the greatest harmony and conjugal felicity. He was deprived of the heroic prince his son, who departed this life in the 46th year of his age, when he had acquired the high∣est reputation for his valour, his wisdom, temperance, and virtue, leaving a son, the apparent heir of the crown, an infant of tender years. The king saw the ter∣ritories he had won by his victorious sword snatched from his empire by the silent hand of unpropitious Providence; for what he gained by unremitting warfare and heroic deeds, were imperceptibly, as it were, lost without a struggle in any wise similar to those arduous labours by which they were purchased. A strange depra∣ty had seized the whole nation; an unbridled debauchery every-where prevailed; the women, deserting the precious characteristic of modesty, that chief ornament of the sex, seemed to glory in the loss of their virtue, and became ostentatious of the most disgraceful conduct: Nothing was more common than to see them riding in troops to the tournaments, in masculine habits, and even military accoutre∣ments. The vices of men were in all ages incitements to female misconduct; the vices of women were from the beginning the strongest expression of the depravity of men. The fair sex, studious to gain the assections of men, will assume the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hions which best effect their purpose; and at this time the excesses were enor∣mous,
<PB N="304" REF="351"/>scandalous, and disgraceful to human nature: The terrors of a plague could not repress them, though it raged to that horrible degree, that in one burial ground only, within the limits of London, 50,000 were interred, who died of that dreadful visitation. The king was seized with the prevailing vices of the times; he forgot the years he had experienced in the chaste endearments of a virtuous queen, who had brought him twelve children; he fell into a degree of dotage amidst the imbe∣cillities of age, forgot all martial spirit, and resigned himself to the disgraceful dal∣liances of an harlot, to whom he yielded the last dregs of love the poor remnant of life retained: He squandered the public treasures to amuse her depraved mind, with all the luxury, and all the diversions the age could produce; the money ap∣propriated by the state for the payment of public debts was embezzled, and thrown away in shows and tournaments, to entertain this concubine, whom he called <HI>The Lady of the Sun,</HI> and on all public occasions exhibited, seated by him in a splen∣did chariot, followed by a train of female equerries, each leading a besotted knight by his horse's bridle, whilst his afflicted people deeply mourned the depravity and sallen glory of their sovereign. The prince of Wales lived to see this disgraceful change in the royal character; he used his influence to correct the enormities he abhorred, and to remove the obnoxious courtiers who, with their poisonous adula∣tion, held the king in the fetters of folly: But death snatched him from the trou∣bled scene, to bestow ineffable rewards for his exalted virtues. Confusion soon succeeded; an insurrection of the citizens took place, to repress by violence the influence of those dangerous ministers the king had recalled after the prince of Wales's death. These alarms hurried on the approaching fate of Edward; he had already experienced many calamities, and the rebellion of his subjects was not the last he was to be afflicted with: He lived to see himself deserted by all the world, even in the approaching hour of death he called in vain for the assistance of his flying domestics; and when life's last moments were suspended in the hand of fate, the woman who had seduced him from his honour robbed his apart∣ments, stripped the rings from his hands, and left him in the distressful instant of agony and dismay. He died in the 65th year of his age, and 51st of his reign, A. D. 1377. The excellent qualities he displayed in the vigour of life and fulness of judgment, the benevolence of mind, the honour and virtue which he exhibited in every private as well as public capacity, render the picture of such ruins the more melancholy.</P>
<P>Richard the Second, son of the Black Prince, on his accession to the throne of England, was only eleven years of age: During the remaining four years of our prelate's life, he does not appear in any public commission of distinguished trust.</P>
<P>It has been said by some, that the only ecclesiastical preferments he enjoyed, be∣fore his appointment to the episcopacy, were the prebends of York and Lincoln<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">W. de Chambre.—Angl. Sac. so. 770.—Aso vide notes, p. 300.</NOTE>. Fuller<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ch. Hist. l. 4, p. 116.</NOTE> says, he had not any episcopal qualification; yet it may well be conceived, from the high estimation he was held in by his sovereign, who at that time bestow∣ed his savours on characters of merit, that, notwithstanding his clerical abilities were not of the first eminence, he was a man of those excellencies necessary to sill
<PB N="305" REF="352"/>this See, so important to the state in its palatine jurisdiction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This prelate was of a martial character, for in the year 1346 he had the command of a body of troops a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Normandy.—Noble, p. 27.</NOTE>. He is described as possessing a noble principle, though rather tenacious: His person was venerable, tall, and grey-headed; he was portly in his gait and carriage, was hospitable and courteous, and charitable to the poor. He did not molest his monks or provin∣cials with any oppressive principles, or disturb them in their rights or possessions: He lived in great familiarity with the members of the convent, delighting much in their society; and under his government the church and his people enjoyed great tranquillity. A disagreeable reflection strikes the mind on reading the following sentence in Chambrè <HI>Honorificos viros diligens habere, et non pueros; equos pro vec∣tura, non equuolos.</HI> Had not an enormous vice contaminated the private character of ecclesiastics in that age, there would have been no necessity for the historian, an ecclesiastic, to have noticed this matter as a cause of praise in the life of our bishop; or, if some of his predecessors had not been suspected of the enormity, he would not have had this singular eulogium on his character<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">W. de Chambre.—Angl. Sac. so. 771.</NOTE>. He made several munificent gifts to the church, and in his time it received two of the greatest ornaments now standing therein: The exquisite work which decorates the high altar was given by John Neville, and erected in the year 1380; and the throne for the prelates was erected by this bishop, under the arch of which he prepared his own tomb, and gave lands near Auckland, called Enknoll, for the maintenance of a priest to say mass there. He restored many parts of the castle of Durham, which, from their antiquity and neglect, were in want of repair: He built a-new the Bishops∣hall, and also the Constables-hall, with offices and other necessary apartments thereto. The city of Durham, though placed on so strong a situation, and defend∣ed with a wall, he still further fortisied by building a tower to the castle. He erected a sumptuous palace in the Strand, London, (now the Adelphi buildings) for the residence of himself and successors whilst attending parliament, or in their ser∣vices at court, which he devised by will accordingly. He rebuilt or repaired many other edifices belonging this See. Chambrè says, he founded the college in Oxford called Durham college, (now Trinity) for eight monks of the See of Durham, and eight scholars, and endowed it with an ample revenue for the support of the monks and students; but this appears to be an error, not only from what has pre∣ceded in this work, but from the authority after mentioned: Tanner, indeed, has fallen into this mistake<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 184.</NOTE>; but, notwithstanding his great credit, the reader will re∣collect, that, in the year 1290, prior Hoton, with the aid of the convent of Dur∣ham, first instituted a house at Oxford for eight Benedictine monks, and dedicated the same to St Cuthbert<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Dugdale's Hist. Ch. Durham, p. 76.</NOTE>. Anthony Wood says<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 48.</NOTE>, bishop Bury finished this col∣lege, and bishop Hatfield enlarged the endowment, and made it permanent, ap∣pointing the eight monks to be chosen out of Durham priory, by the prior and convent, the senior of them to be <HI>custos,</HI> where they were to study philosophy and divinity. The eight students were called <HI>Scholares seculares,</HI> and to study gram∣mar
<PB N="306" REF="353"/>and philosophy; to be chosen, four out of the diocese of Durham, two out of Allertonshire, and two out of Hovedenshire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stevena's Monasticon, vol. i. p. 341.</NOTE>; and, Stevens says<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>, for mak∣ing more fit and convenient buildings there, he paid 4,000 marks for the use of the college, to William Walworth mayor of London, John Philpot citizen, and Threder and Berryington monks of Durham, to lay out the money in purchase. He is said to be the sounder of the friary at Northallerton, for Carmelites; it is certain he was a great benefactor thereto.</P>
<P>As to the coinage of this province, Mr Noble says, <Q>None of our authors, who “have treated on English money, have given any coins that can be supposed to belong to this bishop; though it is certain that the king granted him patents for coining pennies, both in the year 1344 and 1345<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In the sixth volume of Rymer's Foedera, manuscript copy, in the Cotton library (but not in the printed volumes) are the three following patents for coming money at Durham.
<P>1344, 18 Edw. III. Syllabus index 32 pro (Richard Bury) episcopo Dunolm. de cuneis pro sterlingis, n<SUP>o</SUP> 93. Tanner (Notitia, p. 113) says, pro tribus cuneis pro sterlingis monetis regis fabricandi.</P>

De cuneis (electo Thomas Hatfield) episcopo Dunelm. liberandis, n<SUP>o</SUP> 136.—The author (Mr Nobb) had these patents searched for, but without success.</P></NOTE>. As he received these grants so late, it is very probable that he might never coin any money, and his being so much taken up with the temporal concerns of the state, the greatest part of his episcopate, rather consirms this opinion. Bishop Hatfield distinguish∣ed his money by the same modest device his predecessor Kellow had used; how∣ever, their coins are easily known from each other by the spelling of the king's name in the epigraphe of the obverse, which upon the former bishop's is ED∣WA, EDWAR, or EDWARD; upon those of this prelate the name is always EDWARDUS, (which, Snelling says, was the most usual method of putting the king's name upon the pennies, though some of them read only EDWAR, or EDWARD) and more particularly by the weight, which is the safer way of determining them; for Edward III. in the ninth year of his reign, 1353, reduced the penny to eighteen grains, which was several years before our pre∣late was elected: From these circumstances we are enabled to six the pennies in the plate to this bishop. Upon the obverse of one is this epigraphe, EDWAR∣DUS REX ANGL. Z. with a coronet (the mint-mark, which in this reign first began to be used) upon the reverse: It reads, CIVITAS DUREME; others read, EDWARDUS REX ANGLI. Z. F. with an amulet under the king's bust, and have a cross-patee for the mint-mark. The legend upon the reverse is the same as on that before given. The second has this legend on the obverse, EDWARDUS REX ANGLIE, with a cross-patee for the mint-mark. The reverse reads, CIVITAS DUNELMIE. Probably there are others of this bishop's money, that vary some little from either of these types. We have no money coined in the city of Durham, either by Richard II. or by any of the bishops of this See, during his reign; the reason of which it is difficult, at this ”distance of time, to ascertain.</Q></P>

<P>Befides the beneficent works before mentioned, bishop Hatfield gave to the convent, at his death, the stock which he had in Weredale, estimated at 400 marks and upwards; his jewels and insignia, together with 300 marks in silver; a red vestment embroidered with figures in gold, besides many silver vessels and valuable ornaments: One article Chambrè notes, among the things given to the convent, was, a thorn of the crown Christ wore during his passion, which the bishop had received as a precious relic by the gift of Edw. III. After a tedious illness, the bishop departed this life on the 8th day of May, 1381, at his manor of Aleford near London, in the 36th year of his episcopacy, and was buried with great fune∣ral pomp, according to the directions in his will, in the tomb he had prepared for himself in the cathedral church of Durham, whereon is his effigy, and many coats of arms, but no inscription<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In the herald's office, among Dugdale's MSS. notat. c. 41, there is a beautiful drawing of this tomb, and also an engraving thereof in the Antiquarian Repertory. Many authors have mistakenly adopted arms for this bishop which never were borne by him or any of the name, but have been painted upon his monu∣ment by some novice of a workman; for thereon it appears, that the chevron is cut in relief upon the shield, but the lions are not, and that the arms of the Black Prince appear on the same monument cut in relief on the shield, and the painter has painted over the whole, in order to deface it, and probably to please his own fancy, with the chevron, and three lions rampant argent. This circumstance puts it o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of all manner of doubt, that the arms on the monument are most of them (if not every one) false.—See Antiquarian Re∣pertory, vol. iv. p. 119.</NOTE>.

<PB N="312" REF="359"/>
<P>In this prelate's time the excellent prior Fossour died, and was succeeded by Robert de Walworth.</P>
<P>The king's licence for electing a prelate was so expeditiously obtained, that the 29th day of May was appointed for the congress in chapter for that purpose; when, by Chambrè's account, there was a very crouded assembly of electors; and it was determined, for the more speedy dispatch of the business, to proceed by thirteen compromisers, chosen out of the body. So great a difficulty arose in the choice of a proper person to fill this important See, that after sitting several days,
<PB N="313" REF="360"/>the select members requested six persons more might be added to their committee; and this party, on Thursday next after the festival of St Augustine 1381, elected JOHN FORDHAM, then prebendary of York and Lincoln, and secretary to the king: Chambre adds, that this nomination was proclaimed in the chapter-house, and afterwards in the church to the assembled populace, where he was unanimously approved: No his∣torian, before this instance, hath mentioned a procedure of this kind. Notwith∣standing the above account given by my author, it is certain, that a provisionary bull was obtained from the pope, on the 9th day of September 1381, but by what interest uncertain; though, from Fordham's attachment to the king, it is probable it was had by that influence. He did homage, and received restitution of the tem∣poralties, on the 23d of October 1381, and was consecrated in the chapel at Lambeth by the bishop of Oxford, the bishops of Rochester and Bangor assisting at the ce∣remony, on the 5th of January 1381; he made profession on the 18th of August 1382; and on the morrow of St Matthew the apostle, was solemnly enthroned at Durham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">W. de Chambre.—Ang. Sac. p. 77<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A revisal of the innumerable errors and improprieties of the reign of king Richard II. in which this prelate was an active minister, is painful to the historian: Certain it is, bishop Fordham was one of those in whom, during the king's mi∣nority, he placed a chief confidence, and to whose evil councils many of the misfor∣tunes of that part of the reign are attributed.</P>
<P>The followers of Wickliff's religious principles now gained a powerful head, being espoused by the king's uncle the duke of Lancaster; but whether from mo∣tives of piety, or the political principle of restraining the influence of the See of Rome, is not easy to determine: Those who were enemies to the fectary and his followers, attempted to brand them with a charge of encouraging and abetting Wat Tyler's insurrection; a rebellion more ridiculous in its circumstances, and worse supported, than occurs in the annals of any country, noted in history: The charge appears still more futile, when it is considered that the duke of Lancaster was then on the northern borders, and incapable of abetting the project: Yet he did not escape the malice of the king's wicked counsellors, who assiduously spread a report, that he had prepared to march at the head of a Scottish army, to attempt his ne∣phew's deposition.</P>
<P>Amidst the corruptions of this age, is an instance of singular intregrity in the lord chancellor Scrope, who refused to put the great seal to one of those imprudent donations, this prince was so notorious for lavishly bestowing on his flatterers. He protested against the grant as indiscreet and puerile, reverting to his authority from parliament, from whence he was entrusted with the seals; and that, not being an officer of the sovereign, but of the state, he had a right to check the youthful sal∣lies of a prince, who misapplied his gifts, and lavished them on men notoriously enemies to the constitution.</P>
<PB N="314" REF="361"/>
<P>The king, who acted only by the springs of impetuous passions, and the influence of those who abused his youth and weakness by the most pernicious councils, granted a power to the bishops to persecute the new sectaries, and imprison them, as their prejudices or wrath might lead; which brought on a new series of tumults and distresses. He wrested the great seal from his chancellor, and put it, with his own hands, to many of his injurious patents. These, and other stretches of prero∣gative and arbitrary power, greatly alarmed the state, and encreased the detestation which universally prevailed with the people against the court cabal.</P>
<P>In the year 1383, the Scots, taking advantage of the broils in which England was embarrassed, invaded the northern counties; and the duke of Lancaster, in re∣taliation, carried fire and sword to the gates of Edinburgh. In the negociation of the truce which succeeded, bishop Fordham was in commission. On the duke's return from the north, new accusations of treasonable devices were brought against him, and new engines employed, to carry on the detestable machinations of those who sought to remove him, and be delivered from an eye of judgment, which was held over their wretched practices. The king consented to have his uncle accused; and judge Tresilian, a man so infamous in his office that it is to be hoped few have resembled him, made offers to second the project for his destruction, with the most flagrant innovations on the laws of his country. The duke threw himself into Pom∣fret castle, and gathered round him a few brave followers to defend his life; which was at length rescued by the influence of the king's mother. Taken into employ∣ment again, he marched against the Scots, who were committing new ravages on the borders, and was soon after followed by the king, with a large army: Had not the favourites been jealous of the duke's fame at this instant, and induced their so∣vereign to believe he wanted to draw him into danger, Scotland might then have been subdued: But the due measures were retarded, the king's movements slow and indeterminate, and more confusion than resolution was discovered in the military operations; which allowed the Scots time to recover from their panic, and stand upon their guard: The progress made in this war was of little consequence; the country was swept of provisions by the inhabitants, who retired to their mountains and strong holds, so that the English army was obliged to retreat from the famine which threatened them.</P>
<P>A French invasion was apprehended on the duke of Lancaster's departure upon his Spanish expedition, under the character of king of Castile; and supplies were required from parliament, to support an army levied for defence of the country, against the vast armament France had prepared. The commons were ready on this exigence to impower the king to act with vigour; but the influence his odious ministers possessed, induced parliament to request, that those who hitherto so grie∣vously abused their bounty, and lavished in enormous follies the public treasure, should be removed: And an address was accordingly presented to the king. Bishop Fordham, who, on his coming to this See, held the office of secretary to the king, and was now treasurer, and consequently privy to all the sovereign's acts, was one of those obnoxious characters pointed at by the states, and required to be removed,
<PB N="315" REF="362"/>with the earl of Suffolk, then chancellor: And the address prayed, that those who had been entrusted with the public money, might account for its application<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Walsing.—Public Acts.—Rapin.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The king, in the heat of youthful arrogance and impetuous passion, treated the address with indignation and contempt, and said, <Q>To please the parliament, he “”would not turn out the meanest scullion of his kitchen:</Q> What had not the state and constitution to dread from a prince capable of such folly, and a council who could poison his mind with an influence so pernicious! His rashness did not stop here: He retired to Eltham, and sent his chancellor to threaten the commons into compliance with his demands: They, on their part, insisted on his presence in par∣liament; and an open rupture was threatened: The issue produced a declaration from the king, that as he saw his subjects prepared for rebellion, he would crave assistance from the king of France, to reduce them to their duty. Nothing need be added to aggravate proofs of the pernicious influence, which could lead a weak prince, mad with pride, arrogance, and folly, to a declaration so derogatory of the tenor of his coronation oath, and the duties of a sovereign. The exertions of the houses of parliament, thus beset by treacherous and seducive minions, and the con∣stitution attacked with the most dangerous innovations, were noble and generous: The chancellor, with a few of the most atrocious, were removed, and fourteen in∣spectors commissioned to supervise all public affairs.</P>
<P>A providential blow removed all fear of the French invasion; their armament being broken and dispersed by a storm: This event induced parliament to rise: But no sooner were the members returned to the country, than the king restored his favourites, with a levity, which renders his memory still more odious: The duke of Ireland was recalled from banishment; the earls of Suffolk and Neville, and the archbishop of York, were restored to the king's bosom: The duke of Gloucester, with some others, equally obnoxious to the favourites, were intended to have been taken off by poison; but by good fortune escaped. After a multitude of aggravating acts, particularly the Nottingham plot, when it was determined to levy an army, and drive out by force of arms the lords who opposed the king's counsellors and others, which cannot be admitted in rehearsal in this work, an insurrection took place, and the king sought security in the Tower of London.</P>
<P>Whilst these intestine distractions prevailed, in 1387 the Scots invaded England, and penetrated as far as the county of Durham, where they committed great rava∣ges; but on their retreat, laden with spoils, they were intercepted by Hotspur-Percy, who brought them to an engagement at Otterburn<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">For a full account of this battle, see View of Northumb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nd.</NOTE>: The forces of the bishopric of Durham were on their march, but too late to ensure the victory, which Percy was on the eve of obtaining, when a reinforcement of Scots, led by the earl of Dunbar, wrested from him the laurels he had reaped, by seats of the greatest valour and intrepidity, after he had slain Sir William Douglas with his own hands.</P>
<P>In the year 1388, affairs of state assumed a most solemn countenance; the king shewed an incorrigible vice of mind, and his ministers, still pursuing their injurious
<PB N="316" REF="363"/>projects, threw the whole nation into a dreadful ferment: And, in the sequel, a con∣federacy took place, headed by nobles determined for redress; and whose power soon appeared too great to be opposed. The king's assumed countenance of contrition was discovered to be delusive and insincere, and his promises of redress calculated to amuse and deceive, in order to betray the nation into an unsuspicious security, till the duke of Ireland should surprise them with a large armament, which he pre∣pared to lead from Wales. The confederate lords, on full intelligence being had of such measures, marched a body of their retainers, then in arms, into Lon∣don; and a conference was demanded with the king: He was personally re∣proached for his repeated acts of violence against the constitution, and the treach∣erous measures he had countenanced to the injury of the state: On this occasion, he shewed an irresolution so weak, and at the same time a mind so wicked, that the confederates were prompted to threaten their proceeding to the election of a king, if he refused to attend in parliament, and dismiss his evil ministers: Thus held by a coercion his counsellors had not taught him to dread, he appeared on the throne, assented to the banishment of his favourites, among whom was the bishop of Durham: But it is remarked, that some of the king's ministers were admitted to give security, to answer whatever charges might be brought against them, and our prelate was certainly one of those, as he entered a protest in the house of lords in the ensuing parliament after-mentioned.</P>
<P>It has been remarked before, that the bishop's barons served him in the capacity of a privy council. This was the ancient Roman constitution, of which we have one perfect instance remaining to this day in Europe, in the government of Jersey, where the old Roman laws are still retained; five barons constitute a part of the legislative body of that state. By the extract from the account of the bishop's re∣ceiver, given in the note, the reader will see what persons formed the council of this province in the 4th year of this prelate's episcopacy, A.

<P>It appears that the barons, by whose influence bishop Fordham was removed, were determined to fill the See of Durham with a prelate who should not interfere in political matters, and that was a mere ecclesiastical character; for WALTER SKIRLAW, who was translated hither, is not noted by historians in any public capacity in state affairs, during his whole prelacy; and his life was occupied in works of munifi∣cence, not limited to his own province only, but extended to other parts of the kingdom. He was of the degree of doctor of laws, of the university of Ox∣ford: Was first consecrated bishop of Litchfield and Coventry, from whence he was translated to Bath and Wells; and finally, on the 3d day of April 1388, trans∣lated by the pope's bull to the See of Durham: Both the instruments were of one date, which removed Fordham, and placed Skirlaw at Durham.</P>
<P>During the many troubles of Richard's reign, though the nation was in con∣tinual distraction by the power of contending parties, and the weakness and per∣verse principles of the king, frequent attention was paid by the legislature to re∣press the influence of the See of Rome; not so much, perhaps, through constitu∣tional principles, as fear of an encreasing power, to the prejudice of political mea∣sures, during the unsettled state of government, which repeatedly fluctuated from one prevailing party to the other: Notwithstanding this seemed to be a maxim adopted by all, yet when necessity required a particular point to be carried, an in∣novation was sought by either party, and the holy See was called upon to aid the measure: Thus it was, in the displacing Fordham, and bringing in Skirlaw.

<P>The border war was much restrained during this prelate's time: Soon after his accession to the See a truce took place, which was enlarged for a considerable number of years. Robert king of Scotland died in the year 1390, and was suc∣ceeded by his son John, who assumed the name of Robert III. The unsettled state of both nations greatly contributed to repress the military habit of the borderers; and it was not till 1399 that the Scots made an invasion, about the time the un∣happy monarch king Richard II. was deposed.</P>
<P>Henry IV. having been elected to the crown, by the popular cry, without any examination of hereditary claim, marched with an army to the north in the year 1400, but made no other progress in Scotland than to lay waste the borders as he passed; whilst the Scots came behind him, and in retaliation destroyed Bam∣broughshire; he at length being obliged to retreat, from a naked and desolate country, and agree to a truce. In the year 1402 hostilities were renewed, and the Scottish army advanced to the neighbourhood of Newcastle, with the accustomed acts of rapine and ferocity: On their retreat, they suffered a compleat defeat at Homeldon near Wooler<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">For a description of this battle, see View of Northumberland, vol. i. p. 242.</NOTE>. In those invasions, the counties of Northumberland and Cumberland suffered so much, that, at the request of parliament, the king remitted all debts and taxes due to the crown<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. viii. p. 283.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In 1403 arose the formidable defection of the Percys, in which a revolt of Northumberland and Cumberland was dreaded, and that those powerful provin∣ces would annex themselves to Scotland. In all the affairs of the north, nothing is said of bishop Skirlaw; whence those matters, though of the utmost moment to
<PB N="322" REF="369"/>the state, become impertinent to this provincial history, otherwise than as a mem∣ber of the kingdom at large.</P>
<P>On a personal quarrel between the dukes of Norfolk and Hereford, the king sought occasion to send them into banishment: The duke of Lancaster died soon afterwards. Every powerful person the king thought obnoxious to his interests was now removed, and the establishment of his despotic rule seemed to be obtain∣ed to his wish, when a general revolt of the Irish induced him to go thither in person, with a large army; improvidently leaving England open to the descent of the duke of Lancaster. The moment in the hand of Providence for the relief of England was arrived: A powerful insurrection took place, and after every bassled effort of the king to stem the torrent, whereby he was convinced of the detest∣ation in which he was generally held, with a cowardice as abject as his actions were imprudent, the deserted tyrant resigned his diadem, and in the castle of Pom∣fret departed this life, either through obstinate denial of sustenance in the depth of despondency, or by the cruel hands of those who thought it a virtue to deprive him of all future power of distressing the nation. Thus ended the reign and life of a prince, whose passions were his only arbiters: He had not sense or calmness of judgment to form any political plan for a change in the constitution; but all his actions were instigated by pride, arrogance, and folly.</P>
<P>Bishop Skirlaw, during his possession of the See of Durham, erected a new bridge at Shincliffe, and one at Yarm, for the maintenance of which he purchased lands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">W. de Chambre.—Angl. Sac. p. 775.</NOTE>. He also built a bridge at Auckland, and erected a noble gateway of stone work, at the palace there, made a strong tower to the church of Hoveden, for the safety of the inhabitants on any inundation; and expended great sums of mo∣ney in the repairs of that church, whereto he added the chapter-house, which is spoken of by writers of that time as a beautiful edifice: He erected the hall of the manor-house of Hoveden, and was at much cost in other edifices there. He was at the expence of building a great part of the tower of York minster, vulgarly called the lanthern, where his arms are now to be seen. He founded a chantry in that church, with an endowment for a chaplain to celebrate daily mass there. He erected part of the beautiful cloister of Durham, in which he expended 600 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> whereof he gave in his life-time, and 400 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> at his death. He gave 330 marks towards building the dormitory to the convent. His arms are placed in several parts of those works. He was constantly held, as Chambrè says, in great honour by his sovereign. To these we may add, that he erected a beautiful chapel called Skirlaw's chapel, in his native parish of Swyne, in Holderness, and founded a chantry therein. In 1403 he gave the manor of Rothyng to University College, Oxford, for three scholarships. By his will, dated the 15th day of March 1404<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Willis, in his Survey of Cathedrals, says this will is in the archives at Lambeth, vol. i. p. 251.</NOTE>, he gave 200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> for certain clergy to celebrate an anniversary to his memory, 20 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> to Durham college, Oxford; 100 marks to the cathedral church of York; 200 marks to compleat the chantry of Skirlaw, and 100 marks to carry on the build∣ing of the dormitory at Durham: And it is also said, he gave 150 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> to the church
<PB N="323" REF="370"/>of Wells. He departed this life on the 24th of March 1405, and was interred in a magnificent tomb, opposite to that of bishop Hatfield, before the altar of St Blase; which afterwards obtained the name of Skirlaw's Altar. His grave was covered with a curious table of marble, ornamented with his own image, and various others of brass inlaid; and on the breast of his effigies was inscribed a text of scripture, shewn in the notes. The tomb was enclosed with a railing or lattice of curious work, whereat mass was daily celebrated for his soul. Opposite thereto, in the north wall, was a long seat of stone work, between pillar and pillar, where his arms were arranged. The railing round this tomb was afterwards removed, and a stall erected for women to attend divine service<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Browne Willis, in his 'Cathedrals,' gives us his epitaph, vol. i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. p. 242.

<P>As to the coinage of the palatinate in this period, Mr Noble says, <Q>The epis∣copal “coins of Durham may, with greater certainty, be placed to their particular prelates, both before, and for some time after this period, than those of either the archbishoprics of Canterbury or of York; and, at first view, it seems very practicable from the many private marks that are upon the Durham pennies, struck during these reigns, to fix them to the bishops, in whose episcopate they were coined; but it should be observed, that there are many little peculia∣rities in the type of those of Canterbury and York, and also that those minted at Calais and London must have been legal; therefore it is impossible to know whether the pennies of Durham issued from the king's or the bishop's mints; and should they be episcopal, an equal difficulty would occur to know which of the prelates they were coined by. It would have been a very desirable dis∣covery, if we could have obtained a criterion to distinguish the regal silver mo∣ney of each of our kings, Henry IV, V, and VI, from the others, by the prelatical, (supposing those of Durham were so) but this is absolutely impossible, ”for the reasons already assigned.</Q></P>

<P>In the year 1413, the king departed this life, <Q>after having sufficiently expe∣rienced “the misery attending the greatest object of human ambition, when at∣tained ”and held by injustice and cruelty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Border Hist.</NOTE>.</Q> He held the crown of England for upwards of thirteen years; a reign marked with much intestine distress, not only from the dreadful visitation of the plague, the invasions of the Welch, and the for∣midable conspiracies and rebellions which agitated the whole nation, but from the repeated sacrifices to religion, and the cruel executions of the followers of Wick∣liff's tenets. Rapin fays<NOTE PLACE="foot">n="†" Vol. i. p. 401.</NOTE>, <Q>When I consider the excessive commendations be∣stowed “on this prince, I cannot help suspecting, that the glory of being the first burner of heretics, and of protecting the clergy against the attempts of the house of commons, were the mainsprings of all these encomiums: It is well known, the ecclesiastics are as zealous in praising their benefactors, as in black∣ening their opposers." "His distinguished character was an extreme jealousy of a crown, acquired by means his own heart inwards revolted at, and preserved by shedding a torrent of noble blood. The death of Richard II. will be an in∣delible stain to his memory: He performed nothing remarkable, to afford mat∣ter for panegyric: The battle of Shrewsbury, is the only notable action in his whole reign: He employed all his thoughts in preserving his crown, and avoid∣ing all occasions by which it might be endangered. This prudent policy ought to be the chief, if not the sole subject of his encomium, as it was the sole mo∣tive of his actions, wherein nothing appears to render him eminent. Though he caused Richard II. to be deposed, for usurping an absolute power, he did not seem, by his conduct, to have so great an aversion for that crime as he pretend∣ed, ”when it was his interest to express it.</Q></P>
<P>Henry, of Monmouth, ascended the throne, on the death of his father, with∣out any question touching his right to the crown, and was proclaimed by the title of Henry V. So far from being disturbed by any competitor for the diadem, the earl of March was one of the first who came in to swear allegiance. The king, in his education at Oxford, under the care of the bishop of Winchester his uncle, had imbibed the most excellent principles of virtue and honour; under his precepts he had gained an enlarged mind and liberality of sentiments, together with maxims so firmly rooted, as to form the chief springs of conduct, in suture life. His fa∣ther's neglect and jealousy, for a time, threw him into a scene of dissipation; but he was no sooner on the throne, than he displayed a most active and generous mind. He is said to have called before him the companions of his youthful fallies; that he admonished them with much sincerity, and then, with a severity of virtue they did not the least expect, banished them the court. He shewed an earnest wish, at the very opening of his reign, to liberate the king of Scots, on honourable terms; be∣ing sensible his captive, in the lifetime of his father, was a breach of common hos∣pitality, and his detention a political severity, little consistent with honour and ge∣nerous
<PB N="327" REF="374"/>principles: But his virtuous intentions were frustrated, by the intrigues of the court of Scotland, and ambitious projects of the regent, which protracted the release of the prince, for a considerable time. In the year 1414, cardinal Lang∣ley was sent ambassador to France, when a truce was settled, to continue until the following year; which afterwards received a prorogation, till the first day of May<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

<P>The king gained the hearts of the Northumbrians, by restoring Percy in blood, and to the possessions of his ancestors, in his parliament held in the beginning of and year 1415. As the king meditated a blow to be given to France, he appointed the duke of Bedford regent in his absence, of whose privy council we see our car∣dinal a member: By the duke's diligence and attention, the designs of Scotland were bassled; for after the king's departure, the Scots levied an army of 60,000 choice troops, and prepared a train of artillery for the sieges of Berwick and Rox∣burgh; those fatal engines being then lately introduced in the art of war; but both the expeditions failed; and we hear of no other military progress, but mutual in∣roads, by plundering parties on the western march, in which Dumfries was burnt on one side, and Penrith on the other. The king returning from the glorious vic∣tory gained at the battle of Agincourt, immediately appointed commissioners to effect the exchange of Percy, who had remained in Scotland, from the time of the old earl of Northumberland's flight from Berwick, for Murdock Stewart: Those commissioners were chiefly men of this province, viz. Sir Ralph Eure, Sir Wil∣liam Claxton, John Huntman, master in theology, and Richard Holme, licentiate in laws. In the year 1416, the king consented that king James of Scotland should visit his dominions, on delivering sureties for his faithful return: The cardinal was one of the king's commissioners on this occasion, to receive the pledges. In 1417, the cardinal again accepted the office of lord high chancellor, in which he continued till the accession of Henry VI. in 1422, when he resigned it; but, at the request of
<PB N="328" REF="375"/>parliament, re-assumed the seals in November 1423, and in 1425, he sinally re∣signed.</P>
<P>Whilst the king was leading a victorious army in France, in the year 1418, Sir Robert Umframville, then governor of Berwick, with an army composed only of men of the palatinate and Northumbrians, in retaliation of the injuries received by the Scots incursions, carried fire and sword through Tiviotdale and the adjacent territories. Harding says, he burnt all the eastern march, with its market towns of Hawick, Selkirk, Jedburgh, Dunbar and Lauder, and the forests of Lauder∣dale. The king of Scotland still remained unliberated, he attending king Henry in his last campaign in France, from whence the English sovereign never returned, he departing this life on the 31st day of August, A. D. 1422; having reigned over England little more than nine yerrs. His heroic character is admitted, by authors of every distinction. He readily assented to every law proposed, which tended to encrease the influence and prosperity of his people. He renewed the military discipline of his subjects, which was greatly neglected, from the time of Edward III.; and Rapin says, <Q>Never did the English nation shine with such “”lustre, as under this renowned prince.</Q> He sullied the glory of his reign, by yeilding too readily to the importunities of his clergy, to encrease the persecution of the new sectaries in religion: Sir John Oldcastle and his adherents falling sacri∣fices therein. Yet whilst this blow was struck on a few dissenters, in the year 1421, the power of Rome over ecclesiastical benefices was mortally assailed, by an act of parliament, attended with royal proclamations, and an exertion which promised that degree of liberty to be well protected in future.</P>
<P>The infant prince, Henry VI, to whom the crown descended in the Lancastrian line, was not one year old at the time of his father's death; the dukes of Bedford and Gloucester holding the regency, by virtue of the king's death-bed appoint∣ment. The unhappy change induced the Scots to invade England, but with so little success, that Hollingshead, in contempt, calls the expedition <HI>the dirtin raid.</HI> The liberation of the Scottish king now became a matter of much deliberation in the English council, who hoped, from the courtesy he had received in England, and an attachment he had frequently expressed, he would be induced to maintain peace: To engage him further in amicable principles, it was proposed, that he should espouse Jane of Somerset, the daughter of John earl of Somerset, son of John of Gaunt duke of Lancaster, and Katharine, daughter of Thomas Holland earl of Kent. This lady was James's cousin, a person of extraordinary beauty, and for whom he had entertained a passionate affection. The sum stipulated for his maintenance whilst in England was agreed to by both states: The prince re∣ceived his liberty, and in the spring of the year 1424 the marriage was celebrated. The city of Durham was the scene of the great festivity displayed on this occasion: In March the royal pair came thither, attended by a crowd of the English nobility of the first rank, and were met by a numerous train of the most illustrious perso∣nages of Scotland. The hostages for performance of the liberation contract were there received by the English commissioners, and the necessary securities mutually exchanged. A truce was also settled there, to continue for seven years; and a new
<PB N="329" REF="376"/>code of laws, for the government of the borders, were then agreed to. The author of the Border History says, "they present us with the first distinct view of the measures agreed on by the neighbouring nations for those purposes.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 389.</NOTE>" The com∣missioners appointed for these important negociations were John bishop of London, the cardinal bishop of Durham, Henry earl of Northumberland, Ralph earl of Westmorland, Richard Neville warden of the west march, Wm Alnwick keeper of the privy seal, Thomas lord Dacre, John baron of Greystock, and Robert Um∣framville. The conservators on the part of England were, Humphrey duke of G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cester, Thomas duke of Exeter, Edmund earl of March, Richard earl of Warwick, Henry earl of Northumberland, Ralph earl of Westmorland, Robert lord Willoughby, all the English admirals, the keepers of the marches of England towards Scotland, Robert Umframville, and Walter Hungerford, knights. The king and queen of Scotland remained at Durham until the last day of March, of first of April, and then proceeded to their dominions by Melros, at which abbey the Scots king ratified the treaty and convention concluded in England.</P>
<P>An alliance formed between the courts of France and Scotland, in which the dauphin contracted to espouse king James's eldest daughter, alarmed the English court; and commissioners were appointed to enquire after breaches of the truce, to demand the money in arrear for king James's liberation, to attend a change of hostages on that score, and take an estimate of the estates of those who were pro∣posed, to redress grievances, and agree to a new truce. In this commission we see the cardinal bishop, with the archbishop of York, Henry earl of Northumberland, Sir Robert Umframville, and Mr Richard Arnold a cannon of York.</P>
<P>It appears the cardinal, after his resignation of the seals, withdrew himself from the business of the state, and gave much attention to his palatinate; nor is he sound in any public commission after the last above mentioned.</P>
<P>By the interest the cardinal possessed, soon after his consecration, he obtained from the crown the royal charter by letters patent, dated in the eighth year of king Henry IV. (by way of exemplification or inspeximus of preceding grants) in confirmation of the liberties and privileges granted to the bishops by the several potentates, from the establishment of this See.

<P>In this prelate's time, prior John de Hemmingburg died, and John Wessington was elected his successor.</P>
<P>The cardinal departed this life on the 20th day of No∣vember, A. D. 1437, and was interred, agreeable to the directions of his will, dated 21st Dec. A. D. 1436, in the chantry, founded by him, as before mentioned, in the gallile. A table of marble is placed on his tomb, on the foot of which his coat armour is sculptured as in the margin, but no inscription.</P>

<P>A short vacancy of the See took place, before the appointment of ROBERT NEVILL, who was translated from the bishopric of Salisbury, by papal provision, on the 27th day of January 1437. He was the son of Ralph Nevill earl of Westmorland, by Joan Beaufort, the daughter of John of Ghent duke of Lancaster, by his last wife Catharine Swinford.</P>
<P>During the vacancy of the See, Richard Nevil earl of Salisbury held the guar∣dianship, by the king's appointment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A senescal, sheriff, and escheator, were also appointed by him.</NOTE>. The prelate did homage, and received the temporalties, on the 8th day of April 1438: He was consecrated bishop of Salis∣bury in the year 1427, and in that See discovered a peaceful and benevolent dis∣position. In the royal letter to the pope, requiring his translation, he is stiled "<HI>Consanguinum suum charissimum, ex praeclarissima familia oriundum</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">W. de Chambre.—Ang. Sac. p. 777.</NOTE>."</P>

<P>By repeated truces the affairs of the borders were kept in a tolerable quiet state, and no open rupture took place during this prelate's time: Scotland had received a severe blow in the murder of king James I. on whose death an infant prince (James II.) acceded, then only seven years of age: The minority of this sovereign, and the weakness of the wretched king of England, occasioned both states to cherish terms of peace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev'end father in God, right trusty and right well beloved cousin, we grete you well: And albeit that p'clamac'on was late yt all man'er p'sons born in Scotland sh'd void out of the p'tyes of the north from Trent forth, or else to come in to the p'tyes of this side Trent, yet natheless for diverse consi's &amp; causes shewed unto us, we late you wete hit is agreable unto us that by your discrecon all that be within your franchise of the county palatine of Duresine abide still therein, ye said p'clamac'on notwithstanding. Given under our signet, at our manor of Eltham, the xxiiij day Feb'ry. Hen. VI, anno xxvij<SUP>o</SUP>.— Rudd's MSS.</NOTE>: The fierce fight in 1436, between the Northum∣brians led by Percy, and the Scots under Douglas, occasioned a provision to be made in the truce, which was agreed upon soon after king James II.'s accession, in order to protect the peace of both nations, for preventing such assemblings of armed bands, under pretence of hunting, in districts not their own.</P>
<P>Our bishop appears in several commissions for negociating truces with Scotland, particularly in 1449 and 1451; and the city of Durham was, in his time, the seat of many conventions of the delegates of the two nations<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Border Hist. p. 407, 408, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Notwithstanding the turbulent state in which England was involved, under the unhappy influence of the queen and her favourites, the duke of Suffolk, and his successor the duke of Somerset; and the insurrection of the duke of York, at the head of whose adherents were the earl of Salisbury and his son, shortly afterwards earl of War∣wick, by intermarriage with Ann Beauchamp, heiress of that title; yet it does not appear the bishop of Durham or his province was in any manner engaged in the momentous events which took place in that aera. It is therefore difficult to form any competent idea of this prelate's character, other than that he appears to have been a lover of religious peace and retirement.</P>
<P>The only public edifice attributed to bishop Nevill, is the building on the Palace Green, now called the Exchequer, over the door of which his arms are placed. This place was constructed to contain the palatine offices, with halls for holding the sittings of the bishop's chancery and court of pleas. The temporal chancellor of the province still sits there.</P>
<P>In the year 1448 the king made a pilgrimage to the shrine of St Cuthbert, but on what occasion is not said.

<P>The distracted state of this realm, during bishop Booth's time, makes it necessary to pay attention to the various events of those years in which he presided here, as he participated of the calamities of that period, and as the northern counties of England sustained much of the afflictions of those civil wars which marked the un∣happy fate of king Henry VI.</P>
<P>In a treaty held with Scotland for a truce, to commence from the 6th day of July 1457, Booth was a commissioner, with the distinctions of privy seal and arch∣deacon of Richmond. The court of England, involved in the most dangerous civil broils, was anxious to maintain peace with Scotland, and courted the terms of that nation's forbearance from hostilities; for with such adversaries as maintain∣ed the intestine struggles, the queen, though of masculine genius and intrepidity of spirit, had full exercise for all her powers and influence: Various were the events
<PB N="343" REF="390"/>which attended the efforts each party maintained. In the year 1459, the queen's success induced her to a fatal measure against her interest, by proceeding to con∣fiscate the estates of the duke of York and his adherents, in a parliament convened at Coventry, and to condemn to death some of those persons who had appeared in his interest. There was too much secret rancour in the hearts of her subjects, against the oppressive measures of her favourites, and too much affection for the suffering lords, who struggled against the base principles of government, to al∣low a measure of this rigorous nature to take place and prosper. The earl of Warwick, who then possessed Barnardcastle, equipped a fleet at Calais, sur∣prised the king's ships, which lay at Sandwich with succours on board for the duke of Somerset, and passed therewith over into Ireland: He was one of the objects of the queen's severe resentment in the parliament of Coventry, and imme∣diately after, the earl's estates in this province were in the hands of the bishop of Durham, as forfeitures; and he appointed John lord Nevill constable of the castle of Barnardcastle, and master of the forest of Teesdale, with a stipend of 20 marks yearly, to be paid out of the issues of the lordship of Barnardcastle, by the hands of his receiver there; and he appointed Geoffrey Middleton, then high∣sheriff of Durham, keeper of the park of Barnardcastle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2d Jan. 1459.

<P>In consequence of such severities, new distractions arose: A further time of truce was to be obtained from Scotland; and bishop Booth, and John Lilliford dean of Auckland, appear among the commissioners, when a term of five years was agreed upon. The battle of Northampton, fought in July 1460, threw the unhappy so∣vereign into the hands of his enemies, he being taken prisoner in his tent, where
<PB N="344" REF="391"/>he waited the event of an engagement which his queen with no little avidity had sought for. The imbecillity under which the king laboured, rendered him almost totally insensible of distress under such vicissitudes of fortune.

<PB N="345" REF="392"/>
<P>James king of Scotland was induced, by the confusion in which he saw England involved, to attempt the recovery of Roxburgh and Berwick; and, at the siege of the former, died by the bursting of a piece of ordnance, to which he stood near, delighting much in such martial operations. This threw the Scottish nation into great distress, the heir to the crown, James III, being then only seven years of age, and consequently that state was desirous of remaining quiet during the intestine troubles of the sister kingdom.</P>
<P>In the parliament which succeeded the king's captivity, it was resolved, that Henry should hold the crown during his life, and the duke of York be declared his successor; and the same passed into a law. The queen, anxious for the interest of her son, made efforts to recover her influence, and levied a considerable body of forces north of Trent, who were induced to follow her fortunes by a promise that they should be allowed to plunder in their progress. With these she advanced southward, gave the duke of York battle near Wakefield, on the 30th of Decem∣ber 1460, and obtained a complete victory, the duke falling in the field: His youngest son the earl of Rutland, a youth about twelve years of age, flying with his governor, was pursued by lord Clifford, who, regardless of his tender years, plunged a dagger to his heart. The earl of Salisbury was taken prisoner, and be∣headed at Pomfret. The duke's eldest son, the earl of March, had levied forces in Wales, whilst the earl of Warwick, with a considerable army, guarded London. In the earl's route he fell in with a detachment of the queen's troops, in Hereford∣shire, and routed them; yet the queen, with an intrepidity as heroic as ever dis∣tinguished any of her sex, marched forward towards London, undaunted with the ill success of that part of her army over which the earl of March was victorious, and, joining battle with the earl of Warwick near St Albans, prevailed, and reco∣vered possession of the king. But this success was soon blighted by the approach of the earl of March, whose superior strength she durst not engage, especially un∣der the prejudices which prevailed against her troops on every hand, for their cruelty, licentiousness and rapine: She therefore fled with all speed to the north,
<PB N="346" REF="393"/>and left the metropolis open to the earl, who entered it with a shew of triumph; and soon after, on the 4th day of March, by the management of the earl of War∣wick, was proclaimed king of England, by the name of Edward IV.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ex Rotulo Parliamenti, a<SUP>o</SUP> 1<SUP>o</SUP>, Edw.

<P>The queen, under each reverse of fortune, displayed a mind replete with energy and fortitude. The northern counties retained their loyalty to the Lancastrian interest, and their affection for a race of princes, under whom they had enjoyed so many marks of royal favour. The army which the queen had now reinforced con∣sisted of sixty thousand chosen men, inured to a laborious and hardy life, and ca∣pable of great exertions. Edward saw himself seated on a throne which must ne∣cessarily be supported by arms, whilst the remains of the Lancastrian family opposed his interests. He levied an army, and marched northward, a few days after his proclamation, his coronation being postponed to a future time. After several skir∣mishes, with various success, the battle of Towton-field, on the 20th of March, being Palm-Sunday, brought to an issue the claim of the competitors. An acci∣dent gave great advantage to Edward's army: A fall of snow beat fiercely in the faces of the Lancastrian troops, and deprived them of the execution their bowmen usually had performed, by their not being able to discern the necessary distance, to give their arrows effect. A close fight succeeded the discharge of arrows; and the dreadful conflict lasted from morning till evening, during which time Victory often shifted her bloody pinion from party to party, and hovered over each heroic pha∣lanx with a tremendous uncertainty. At length the Lancastrian line gave way, but fighting in the retreat suspended the event, and yet rendered it still dubious,
<PB N="347" REF="394"/>till at length a panic prevailed, and the rout began. A horrid slaughter ensued: The flying troops were cut down by a cruelty of prudence, which obliged Edward to give no quarter, that he might not be encumbered with prisoners. The calamities of the discomfited army were rendered complete by an attempt to cross the river; when the Wherf received such multitudes, that the dead formed a bridge for the living: There fell no less a number than 36,776 in this battle. The earls of Northumberland and Westmorland (whom the bishop had before appointed constable of Barnardcastle) were among the slain. Henry and his queen found means to escape from York, where they waited the event of this battle, and took refuge in Edinburgh. King Edward marched to York, whilst the earl of Warwick had it in command to reduce such fortresses in the north as were in the hands of his adversaries; but he was content with the submission of a few, and left the castles of Northumberland unassailed. In June following Edward was crowned, and, in a parliament convoked soon afterwards, the revolution was confirmed, and such acts as were made by Henry VI. during a reign of thirty years, were totally repealed and annulled.</P>
<P>Whilst queen Margaret was in Scotland, she was assiduous in negociating with that state a renewal of her interest: She made a formal surrender of Berwick to the Scots, and contracted Edward her son with Margaret the king's sister. K. Ed∣ward had proposed a new truce, but was baffled in his projects by the conduct and address of the queen, who still retained an ascendancy at that court, so that he was induced to enter into a compact with the turbulent earl of Ross, lord of the Isles, by whose efforts he did not doubt to divert the arms of Scotland from any attempt on his northern territories. Rapin says, from the Public Acts xi. p. 483, that the bishop of Durham was one of Edward's commissioners to manage this compact; and observes, that its not being mentioned by any English historian might probably be owing to its lying concealed among the records of England, till it appeared in the collection of the Public Acts. There can be no want of candour in question∣ing the authenticity of this part of Rapin's story, as the bishop of Durham was un∣der Edward's displeasure, most probably for taking part with queen Margaret, and abetting her cause, previous to the battle of Towton: His putting the earl of Warwick's castle of Barnardcastle into the hands of John lord Nevill, by appoint∣ing him constable, was a strong indication, if not an expression, of his favour to that interest. The disagreement came to such a height, that, on the 7th of De∣cember 1462<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rot. B.

<PB N="349" REF="396"/>Mr Randal, in a MS. note, says, the cause of this deprivation was uncertain; but when the connection which subsisted between the bishop and the deposed family is considered, it is not hard to account for. Perhaps much of his temperance in state matters only took place after the correction before stated. It appears indeed that he gained the esteem and confidence of Edward IV. but the instances of royal favour derived from that prince did not accrue, till after the last efforts of his op∣ponents were extinguished. During the bishop's disgrace, queen Margaret made several weak attempts to revive the cause of her family; and, in 1463, with the aid of France, and 500 men under the conduct of Brezee, she entered Northum∣berland; but nothing effectual was done, the troops were dispersed by a storm, and the general had a narrow escape. Soon afterwards, the Northumbrians and borderers, from their old affection, took up arms, and formed a powerful party; to oppose whom, lord Montague was sent northward, with the forces which were ready to march, whilst the king, with a large armament, prepared to follow, de∣termined to retaliate on the Scots, who fostered and gave aid to his enemies. His lordship advanced to Durham, where he staid for some reinforcements, and then proceeded to meet a detachment of the queen's army, which he came up with at Hedgeley Moor, and brought to an engagement: Lord Percy, who had sworn allegiance to Edward, but was in arms for Henry, was slain there, and his party routed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At Percy Cross.—See an account of this battle in the View of Northumberland.</NOTE>. The battle of Hexham Levels<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">V de u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> supra.</NOTE> soon after ensued, where Henry lay in entrenchments, with the main body of his troops, over whom lord Montague ob∣tained a compleat victory; and the royal personages narrowly escaped the fury of the sword. Edward, who had advanced no further than Durham, sent the earl of Warwick to reduce the castles of Northumberland, whilst he proceeded on his re∣turn to London<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">For a full account of the reduction of the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee View of Northumberland</NOTE>. The success of Edward's arms cooled the affections of the Scots
<PB N="350" REF="397"/>and French towards the deposed family: Edinburgh was no longer a place of safe refuge to them; that court had agreed to a trace with England, and some secret articles were stipulated which most probably concerned Henry, for soon after we are told of that family's departure from Scotland. The queen with her son retired to her father's territories; and Henry, with a mind forlorn or vacant, wandered, in disguise, about England, vainly searching for a protector among his people, till he was discovered by one of the king's party, and under many indignities car∣ried prisoner to the Tower.</P>
<P>Every circumstance now conspired to seat Edward securely on the throne, had he not chose to intermarry with a subject, to satisfy a violent passion, and admit an influx of persons of inferior birth to the highest offices and dignities of the state. The earl of Warwick was negociating a marriage for his sovereign with the sister of the queen of France, and looked upon himself as highly affronted by the king's rash engagement; but probably the jealousy of others rising to eminence without his approbation, wrought most powerfully on his passions; and it was not long before the earl retired to the north, and George Nevill archbishop of York to his diocese. Rapin calls the earl "the proudest lord that England ever knew;" and says, "his resentment against the king, fired by offended pride, was irritated to its pitch by the sense he entertained of the king's obligations to him." In this retirement he formed a plan for the deposing a prince to whom he had given a diadem; and to that end he engaged the duke of Clarence, the king's brother, in the project, irritating his mind with the circumstances of neglect which the king had showered on him; and, to bind him in the compact, he gave him his eldest daughter in marriage. An insurrection soon took place, composed of men of Yorkshire and other northern counties, headed by Sir Hen. Nevill, son of lord Latimer, and Sir John Conyers. The succeeding battle of Banbury was in favour of the malcontents; after which they were joined by the men of Northampton∣shire, led by Robert Hildyard. A series of successes tended greatly to encrease this army; and the king, having levied in haste all the troops he was able, prepared to give the insurgents battle near Warwick. A treaty for redress of grievances being proposed, the unsheathing of the sword was suspended; and under the hopes of a speedy conciliation, the king was guilty of such negligence, that Warwick surprised him in the night, and carried him prisoner to his castle of Middleham, in Yorkshire, where he committed him to the care of his brother the archbishop of York. The king in a little time found means to elude the vigilance of his keeper, and escaped. An immediate change of affairs took place in his favour, and all the projects of the earl of Warwick and his party were speedily overturned, by the victory obtained by the king at the battle of Stamford, from which the duke of Clarence and the earl fled to France.</P>
<P>The earl, on this occasion, shewed the great powers of his political and intri∣guing genius, which no adversity could blunt, or disappointment cool. He brought about a marriage between his youngest daughter and Edward, son of Henry; and then entered into a treaty with the king of France, who granted him aid, to attempt the restoration of the deposed family. At the head of a few troops,
<PB N="351" REF="398"/>furnished by France, the earl invaded England, and had no sooner made good his landing, than multitudes flocked to his standard, and he found himself in a short time in command of an army of 60,000 men. He caused Henry VI. to be pro∣claimed. King Edward, though he had treated all information of the earl's en∣terprise with contempt, was in a few days obliged to fly for refuge to Holland, without having had a means of trying the event of a battle. Edward's queen took sanctuary in Westminster Abbey, where she bore a prince called Edward. All tu∣mult being soon suppressed, Henry VI. was solemnly proclaimed, and remounted the throne: But this dawn of prosperity was only momentary, for Edward, having obtained assistance from the duke of Burgundy in the middle of March 1471, land∣ed at Ravenspur in the Humber, with about 2000 men, and took his route to∣wards York. By his prudent measures, and the coming over of the duke of Gloucester to his party, without the hazard of a battle he approached London, where he was received with acclamations of joy by all ranks of people. The poor unhappy monarch, the mere shadow of a king, instantly found himself a prisoner, not having a thought even capable of attempting an escape. The enraged earl of Warwick, baffled and disappointed in his measures, and breathing vengeance on those who opposed his will, which he had not been used to have controuled, marched his army towards the capital, determined to hazard all to the sword; and in the battle of Barnet, fought on the 14th day of April, being Easter-day, he fell; and the fate of that field, immediately followed by the battle of Tewks∣bury, determined the unhappy cause of Henry and his adherents. Queen Marga∣ret was taken prisoner, and committed to the Tower, where she remained, till re∣deemed by her father four years afterwards. Prince Edward, a youth of eighteen years of age, was slain in cold blood, and Henry was assassinated in prison.</P>
<P>Thus ended the life of that unhappy monarch, who had reigned thirty-eight years and upwards before he was deposed, having succeeded to the crown before he was one year old. Through natural infirmities he was incapable of governing; so that his own misfortunes, and the bloodshed of his reign, may justly be attri∣buted to the froward temper of his queen, whose impetuous passions engaged her with favourites arrogant and ambitious, without a genius capable of managing a state like England, tho' possessing a masculine mind. Henry is described by Rapin as being remarkably chaste and temperate; and adds, "he was extremely religious, abhorring injustice and cruelty." His whole character might be the consequence of his weak frame; and the extreme of religion, being bigotry and superstition, constantly marks only men of weak minds. Led by the machinations of others, it is but justice to his character to say, that he was the innocent cause of the distrac∣tion and slaughter which marked his miserable reign.</P>
<P>After K. Edward IV. restored the temporalties in 1464, bishop Booth seems to have totally deserted those from whom he derived his first preferment, and such a chain of benefits. Under the attainders of the parliament of Coventry, the bishop of Durham had seized the earl of Warwick's estates within his province; under Edw. IV. in the year 1470, those estates are, by the King's letters under his privy

<P>Yere estre eigiven diverse cons's &amp; reasons why the bpps of Duresme in the times of kings of England Henry III. and Edw. I. aught of r't &amp; be course of the comon laws then had within the bpprick, that is to say, in all places betwix the waters of Tyne &amp; Tyse comonly called the bpprick of Duresme, and in the places called. Norhamshire, Elandshire, &amp; Bedlingtonshire, be the reason of the liberty rihall, that thei within the same, as well all maner of forfauges, grewints, &amp; fallyn, be occacon of rebellion treason or warr against the king, which was then called forsituctores of werre, as for any other cause whats'r it was.</P>
<P>First, itt is to be considered, that in the days of the said kings, Heary III. &amp; Edw. I. &amp; long &amp; many y'rs after, no p'son that had rebelled, done treason, or levyed warr ag't the said king, was y'rof attainted by verdict or auctoritie of parliamt. nor the king of the land the same time for any offence seized any man's land, by any of the said authorityes; but that after the treason or rebellion was committed, the king re∣c'ed the rebell to his peace, or elles refused and denyed to him. In the 1st case, the party put his lands into the king's hands for the surety of the keeping of the peace, and for syne making at the king's will. In the 2d case, that is to say, where the king would not rec'e his rebel to his peace, he forthwith feized his lands as forfeited to him by reason of treason done ag't his person, and this was called forfeiture of weire, that is to say, forfeiture for levying warr ag't the king.</P>
<P>Secondly, it is to be considered, that lands having then franchizes and libertys reall, by reason of the same, had forfeitures of warr within them, as the king had in other places of the realme without the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d liberties, and as the king for treason comitted, seized lands lying within these libertyes, all which they only did, because, that the forfeiture of warr appertaineth to libertys, and that may and doth appear, as well by usage and practi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that then ran and was put in uze, as also by great reason, and the common law that then rann and yet doth. First, the same appeareth by of reason this, except it be by authority of par∣liament, nor yet to be but to the wrong of the lord, unless it be by his assent direct v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l indirect, the liberty royall cannot nor may not be denyed, &amp;c. for the lord, having liberty regall, has <HI>jura regalia</HI> (y't is to say) <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nta jura regalia, q. indefinite in jure equi—universali:</HI> Whereupon it must needs follow, that it the lord have <HI>universa jura regalia,</HI> the king, except by authority of parliament, as above, cannot have neither for∣feiture of warr nor of any other forfeiture within the said liberty. Secondly, the same appeareth thus in such places where liberty regal is; there the king's writt runneth not, nor none of the king's officers nor minister can or may by the king's writt nor other commandement entre, do any office, or seize any lands by way of escheat or forfeiture; ergo, except it be by authority of parliament as above, they cannot with∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> liberty regall meddle with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ture of wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rd<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>th thus in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s of for∣feitures fallen by the course of the common law, &amp; without it be expressly o'rwise provided by authority of parliament, the lord seizeth within the liberty regall as the king doth without, as thus, John at Style, lord of the manor of Dale within Midd, &amp; of the manor of Roke, lying within the bpp'k of Duresine, is attaint∣ed of felony or of high treason by the verdict of the common law, like as the king in this ease, the king may seize the manor of Dale lying in Midd'x, for the b'p of Duresme, by reason of his liberty regall, may seize the manor lying within the said bpp'k. But the forfeitures of warr in the days of the said K. Hen. III. and K. Edw. I. passed not then by so great authority as they do now at the comon law; ergo, that the lord having liberty regall may now seize lands of persons attainted of treason at the comon law: A fortiori, he might not so do in the days of the said kings, when there were none attainted by any or not so great process of the law as be now. Fourthly, the same appeareth by usage &amp; continual po'ssion, since the time that forfeitures of warr were first archieved, as in the time of K. Hen. III. during the barons warr Petrus de Monteforti, lord of the manor of Gretham, lying within the liberty of the said b'p'k, (that is to say) in the wapentake of Sadberg, betwixt the waters of Tyne and Tease within the bishoprick of Duresme, for warr levying against the king at the battle of Evesham, what he was slayne, forfeited, not only the said Gretham, but also all the lands that he had within the realm of England: And also be it, that said king, supposing forfeiture of warr to appertain to him within the said bpp'k, as it did in other places without, seized the said manor into his hands. The same king afterwards well understood of the right of the said b'p, restored to him the said manor, as by his l'res patent y<SUB>i</SUB>'rupon made to the said bpp it doth plainly ap∣pear. This was the 1st forfeiture of warr, whereof it now remaining in the manner of record. The 2 <ABBR>d</ABBR> forfeiture of warr was in the 21st year of K. Edw. I. by John Balyol then K. of Scots, the which, by levying warr against the K. forfeited to the said K. Edw. all the lands that he had out of the realm of England out of the bpp'k of Duresme; and to the said same b'p all the lands that he had within his liberty regall, which were no small lands, and into the same authority then she bishop in right of his church of Duresine entred, and of them was possessed many years. Also one John Percy, adherent to the said John Balyol, by the same reason forfeited the manor of Witchlaw lying within the said liberty, into the which, the said Anthony (Beke) entred in the right of his church, and afterward gave it to John Fitz Marmaduc, all of it. Be the same manor afterwards returned into the hands of the successor of the said bishop yet remaineth. Also one Americk Howden, adherent to the same K. of Scots, forfeited by reason thereof, all the lands and tenements that he had in Berrington and Keyley lying in the liberty of the said bishop of Norhamshire, into the which the said Anthony entred, and his successors is at this day seized of part of the same; and part the said Anthony gave to Robert Manners, whereof the heirs of the said Robert be yet seized. Also one Walter Fitz James, adherent to the said John Balioll, by reason thereof forfeited the manors of Bukton and Goswyke lying in Elandshire within the liberty of the said bpp'k, into the which the said Bp Anth, then entred, &amp; the same kept years and days, and afterward gave the same Bukton so Roger Picard, and of the same his heirs be yet seized; and the same Goswick he gave to the prior of Eland, whereof his successors be yet seized. The 3 <ABBR>d</ABBR> forfeiture was in the 29th year of the same king, by Rob. de Bruss, then K. of Scots, by levying of warr agt. the same king, by reason whereof he forfeited to the same king, all the lands that he had within England out of the liberty of the b'p of Duresme; and to the same b'p, all the lands within the same liberty, (that is to say) the manor of Hert lying within the b'p'k of Duresme, into the which the said Anthony entred, &amp; of the same was peaceably possessed, till the same king, the 34th year of his reign, without process of law, gave the same manor to Sir Rob. Clyssord. Also one John Selby, adherent to the same K. of Scots, for the same cause forfeited the manor of Fellyng lying within the said b'r'k, into the which the same Anth. then b'p entred, and his successors yet hath the same.</P>
<P>Item, the 3 <ABBR>d</ABBR> forfeiture of warr was in the days of K. Hen. IV. The 4th forfeiture in K. Hen. V.'s days, and the 5th forfeiture in K. Hen. VI. And howbeit, that the same were authorised by the autho∣rity of parliament, yet ** first were none other nor no longer, but as the comon law would; and the third was little gretten. And tho' no person attainted in K. H.'s days the IV. nor K. H.'s days the VI. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad any land; or tenements with the liberty of the b'p of Duresme, yett in every of the said par∣liament was an express of special provision for salvation of the libertyes royall, &amp; by virtue thereof, the b'p of Duresme in right of his church had the forfeiture of the manor of Winston, being within his liberty royall of Duresme, &amp; belonging to the lord Scrope of Masham then attainted; he had also the manor of Urp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th., &amp; divers lands &amp; tenements in Conset, Croldowley, &amp; Sedgeseld. And also the manor of Elslob, belonging to Sir Tho. Grey knt. then attainted, and part of them lying within the wapentake of Sadbury, where the manor of Hert lyeth. The same bishop had then also all the lands and tenements that the said Sir Tho. Grey had within his liberty royall of Norhamshire &amp; Elandshire, to the value of 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and above. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> forfeiture wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in K. Edward's days the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th, by authority of parliament, by which it was ordained by express words, that same K. should have all the lands &amp; tenements that were without the bpp'k of Dur∣esme and the b'p in his right of his church, all that were within the same, and so the manor of Hert, whereof the lord Clifford was seized at the same time of the said attainder.</P>
<P>Fifthly, that forfeiture of warr appertaineth and is appendant to liberty royal, appeareth by a judgment of parl. of K. Edw. III. the first year of his reign, for howbeit, that K. Edw. I. without any process of the law, and the party not called, gave to Sir Robert Clifford the manor of Hert, whereof Anth. Beke, then bi∣shop of Duresme, by the forfeiture of Robert Bruss, was then seized, yet the same Anth. and his successors, (that is to say) Rich. Kellawe in the time of K. Edw. II. and Lewis in the time of K. Edw. III. sued for their rights concerning the said manor in divers parliaments. The said Lewis obtained judgment thereof in the said first parl. and had upon the same, writts, executories, as in yt case appertained, the which judg∣ments and writs are ready to be shewed.</P>
<P>Item, the earl of Warwyck, and the lord Clifford, which oftentimes by bills putt to the kings and their counsellors, for that voiding and annulling of the said judgment, never could obtain their intent in that be∣half, and in the same theyr bills, they never denyd forfeiture of warr to append and appertain to liberty royall, nor never for that cause desired the said judgment to be repelled, albeit, that it is to be thought, if it had so been, y't forfeiture of warr had not in these days appertained to liberty royall, the said judg∣ment would not have been obtained, nor would not have been forgotten, so have been layed by the said earle and lord for the repealing of the said judgment.</P>
<P>And finally for a right grete, prove, that forfeiture of warr in the said K. Hen. III. and Edw. I. apper∣tained to liberty royall, it is for a treughe, that wereas one of the horsemen of the said K. Edw. I. by his negligent riding upon some of the coursers of the said king fell, and by the same fall was slain, the bishop of Durham then being, had the escheat of the said horse.</P>
<P>Also it is confessed by the lord Clifford in divers parts of the title, that he pretendeth to the manor of Hert, that the bishop of Duresme hath <HI>jura regalia,</HI> for in the end of the said title he says thus as follows: Also it is to be remembered and considered, that the said lord can follow no action against the bishop in his own court, whereby he hath <HI>jura regalia</HI> to continue his said right, but is without remedy.

<P>A treaty of marriage being concluded between the king of Scotland's eldest son and king Edward's second daughter, Cecily, and a truce established, the peace of the borders was secured during the remainder of this prelate's time; for on the first of September 1476 he was translated to the metropolitan See of York, on the death of archbishop Nevill, who had undergone many severe sufferings, after the fall of his family, under the rigour and revenge of the king, and whose exit, it is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>id, was hastened by the grief and anxiety he had experienced. Booth sat near four years at York, and died on the 19th day of May 1480, at Southwell, where, according to the History of the Church of York, he was interred<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Browne Willis says, his tomb is yet to be seen, being a plain altar monument, which had his effigy en∣graven on brass, and an inscription under it long since defaced.</NOTE>.

In this conjecture that gentleman is probably right; for we have, it is apprehended, no coins of this city without some par∣ticular letter, or other device upon them, that evinces their being coined by the ”bishops of this See, who were cotemporary with that monarch.</Q></P>

The grant recites, that it had been immemorially the privilege of the bishops of this See to coin the former sort of money, but never the latter. From hence it is clear, that this prelate was the first that had a mint for halfpen∣nies, and that not till this reign. Probably there was never any money of that value coined before at Durham; for though there were royal mints during the reigns of the three first Edwards, after the Conquest, who all coined both half∣pennies and farthings, no money of either of these kinds have been found of theirs of this city. The bishop, by licence dated the 26th day of August, in the same year that he received his charter from K. Edward IV, gives permission to Wm Omoryche, of York, goldsmith, to grave and print two dozen of trussels and one dozen of standards for pennies, and eight trussels and four standards for halfpennies. By this we perceive that there was but a small quantity of halfpennies, in proportion to the pennies, and probably the coining of them was soon discontinued by this prelate; for by another licence, dated the 4th of August following, to the same person, the latter was to grave and print three dozen of trussels and two dozen of standards for pennies, but no mention is ”made of halfpennies<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">From the close rolls of the Chancery at Durham, Rot.

<P>The author of this curious treatise gives us sive more specimens<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See plate of coinage, letters G G G G. N<SUP>o</SUP> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</NOTE>, on which he observes, that <Q>the first of the engraved pennies is mutilated, the legend “upon the obverse obliterated, and that upon the reverse so very imperfect that it is not legible. We may, however, discover, from the remains of those letters still visible, that the inscription is blundered; and it is the more reasona∣ble to suppose it so, as the B, which is the initial of the bishop's surname, upon the side of the king's bust, is reversed. The mint-mark upon the obverse is three pellets, set triangularly, in the same manner as those are by the side of the mask, opposite the B<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The ♈, and other marks noted by Mr Noble, appear to be numerals, and refer to the sum coined in that die. If some account of this sort was not intended, what need for so many dies for one coinage?</NOTE>. Upon the center of the bars of the cross, upon the re∣verse, is the letter D, (which must be read <HI>Dunelmensis</HI>), from which, and the B upon the obverse, we may be certain that this penny was coined by bishop Booth, in his mint at Durham. In the same cabinet with the above<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mr Barker's, of Birmingham.</NOTE> are seve∣ral others, which vary some little from this: One has the letter B on the other side of the king's bust, which is set slanting, but without any pellets; the letter D is also placed as that upon N<SUP>o</SUP> 1. &amp;c. &amp;c.—N<SUP>o</SUP> 2. has this epigraphe, ED∣WARD DI GRA REX ANGL.; upon the right side of the king's bust is the letter B, for Booth; the cross side reads, CIVITAS DVNELMIE. This penny has a rose upon the center of the bars of the cross, made like those of the York mint. The rose, though differently made, is also the mint-mark; but it appears only upon the obverse.—N<SUP>o</SUP> 3. is the reverse of a penny, which, upon the head side, differs not from those issued from the royal mints in this reign. The legend reads, EDWARD REX ANGLIE, and between the words are small crosses; the reverse, CIVITAS DONOLI'; and upon the center of the bars of the cross is much such a rose as the mint-mark upon N<SUP>o</SUP> 2. As there are no initials upon this piece, it may be questioned whether it was not coined by bishop Dudley, who likewise presided over the See of Durham in this reign; but as the prelate whose coins we are now giving was the first in the reign of Edw. IV. it is more reasonable to suppose that he would give the rose only, than bishop Dudley, who must have been aware, that, as the rose had been the device of his predecessor, it would be no distinction of his money with∣out some addition. It should also be remarked, that bishop Booth copied the rose, as well as several other peculiarities which are found upon the prelatical coins of York, as will be seen hereafter. From these circumstances it is appre∣hended that this coin is properly appropriated to bishop Booth.—N<SUP>o</SUP> 4. has this inscription upon the obverse, EDWARD DI GRA REX ANG.; the letter B is also upon one side of the bust, and a key upon the other; the reverse reads, CIVITAS DERAME; the letter D, for <HI>Dunelmensis,</HI> is placed as upon N<SUP>o</SUP> 1.; and the mint-mark, if there was one, would be upon the obverse only. Others of this type have the rose, instead of the letter D, upon the bars of the
<PB N="359" REF="406"/>cross upon the reverse.—N<SUP>o</SUP> 5. is a very curious penny of this bishop; the epi∣graphe upon the head side is, EDWARD DI GRA REX ANGLIE. On the sides of the bust are the letter C, for <HI>cancellarius,</HI> and a cross formed of four pellets joined. The type of this penny was copied from one of archbishop Kemp, who, like him, was both lord chancellor and a prelate, and both endeavoured to express their two-fold office upon their money: The reverse reads, CIVITAS DONOLI. A coronet is the mint-mark, but it appears only upon the obverse. The different types of bishop Booth's money were undoubtedly copied from the archbishops of York; the initial of the prelate's surname, which we find on his pennies, is the first specimen of the kind upon the obverse of any of the Dur∣ham money; the initial of his temporal honour is also (as has been observed) copied from a York coin; and lastly, the rose and key are both evidently bor∣rowed from thence; for neither the rose nor the key have any connection with the Durham mint, but are both of them the proper distinctions of the money of York, particularly the latter. It is wonderful how differently the name of this city is written upon the Durham money, from the reign of Hen. III. to that of Hen. VIII.; whereas the cities of Canterbury, London, and York are spelt with little or no variation. No cabinet, we presume, is possessed of an halfpenny either of bishop Booth or of his successor, though we have several of their pen∣nies: It is more observable, as Mr Snelling acquaints us, that the halfpennies ”of this king are common, and the pennies very scarce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr White, of London, who has so extensive a cabinet, is not possessed of a Durham halfpenny, nor did he ever see one.</NOTE>.</Q></P>

D. 1473, with the chapel royal.</NOTE>, was nominated to this bishopric; in consequence of which he was elected the 26th day of September, 1476; did homage to the king, and had the temporalties of the See restored, on the 14th day of the following. October<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The king, reciting that his beloved clerk, Mr William Dudley, was made bishop of Durham by the pope's apostolical authority, freely grants him all the profits arising out of the b'prick during the vacancy, without being liable to render any account, or to make any composition for the same to himself thereafter.— Randal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s MSS.</NOTE>. He was son of Sir John Dudley, knight of the garter, and ancestor of the barons Dudley. Wharton says, he was <HI>viri nobilis Johannis Baronis Dudlaei filius;</HI> but the former account is more just. On the 29th of July, 1470, he was admitted prebendary of Stillington in York cathedral; and on the 13th of Feb. 1476, obtained a canonry in Wells cathedral; was also archdeacon of Middlesex, and canon of Wolverhampton. He was a great benefactor to Dudley church, in Staffordshire, and to the colleges before mentioned<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">W. de Chamb.—Ang. Sac. p. 778.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Bishop Dudley sat only six years, but it was a period in which the state suffered great convulsions, yet it does not appear he was in any public commission. The dreadful machinations by which Richard duke of Gloucester was opening his pas∣sage to the throne, do not seem to have had any particular influence on the nor∣thern parts of this kingdom, other than such as proceeded from the change of possessors in the large estates of the Warwicks. The duke of Clarence espoused the great earl of Warwick's eldest daughter; the duke of Gloucester the younger, relict of the unfortunate Edward, son of Hen. VI.; yet before Clarence's im∣peachment, which was not till the year 1478, the duke of Gloucester was in pos∣session of the estates of the Warwick family in this province. There is a darkness in this matter not easy to clear up, otherwise than by a conjecture, that in partition between the coheiresses, the northern possessions were assigned to Anne duchess of Gloucester. It is certain the duke of Gloucester, in 1477, was possessed of Bar∣nardcastle, and obtained a royal licence to institute and erect a college within the castle, for a dean with twelve chaplains and six choristers, with power to purchase lands for its endowment<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Pat. 17.

<PB N="362" REF="409"/>year of this king, he confirmed to bishop Booth the forfeitures by the attainder of the earl of Warwick, as is shewn by the king's letters under his privy seal, where∣in the history of former forfeitures is rehearsed. If restoration in blood and of estates was made in favour of the duke of Gloucester, for Anne his wife, it is sin∣gular he should be in possession here, before the impeachment of the duke of Cla∣rence, and against the earl of Warwick his son: This is an obscure part of our provincial history not easily reconciled. The other singularity arising on this mat∣ter is, that the king should grant his licence by letters patent for founding a col∣lege within the limits of the county palatine of Durham, in deprivation of the rights of the bishop. The prelate does not appear under the displeasure of his so∣vereign; he had restitution of the temporalties on the 14th day of October 1476, and the above-mentioned instrument bears date the 21st day of February 1477.</P>
<P>The irruption made by the Scots, during this bishop's time, did not extend be∣yond the borders. The duke of Gloucester's army, which moved in support of the duke of Albany, was composed chiefly of northern men; and we find several re∣cords of the palatine troops being arrayed to join therein<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rot. A. Dudley, N<SUP>o</SUP> 44.—Commission of array, by bishop Dudley, anno 4° pont. sui anno 21 Edw. IV. regis, to serve under Richard duke of Gloucester, brother and general of Edw. IV. against the Scots.
<P><HI>In nova forma duci Gloucestor. &amp; aliis.</HI>—Ibid. N<SUP>o</SUP> 40 &amp; 28.—Spearman's Enq. p. 13.</P></NOTE>, some of which merit particular notice, where the summons is in the name of the duke of Gloucester and others. It appears that Edw. IV. was making innovations on the palatine ju∣risdiction, from the instances before noted: The overbearing character of the duke of Gloucester, and his great influence in right of the possessions of the Warwicks, might be the causes of those over-stretches of power, as they appear to have arisen after the time of his influence.</P>
<P>In this bishop's time, Edward IV. departed this life; a prince whose character was marked with a multitude of errors. His fine person and elegant carriage served only to render the depravity of his mind more striking; his enormities seeming to gain magnitude by the observer's disappointment, who, from an out∣ward countenance, was flattered with the ideas of generous and noble actions. His cruelty was brutal; he never shewed the least compunction for the blood in which his hands were embrued; the image of mercy had not made an impression on his soul, or the nature of the contest, in which he thought it necessary for his cause to cut off so many of the nobility, would have whispered it to his bosom. The execution of his brother, the duke of Clarence, has not yet found a justification
<PB N="363" REF="410"/>even from the depraved pens that worshipped courts in bloody ages. The want of humanity, and every generous feeling of the heart, was expressed by the blow the ruthless tyrant gave prince Edward his captive, whose only crime was his he∣roic virtue. The king's courage and valour were not the effect of principle and virtue, but as the savage ragings of the lion. His lasciviousness, persidy, and con∣tempt of public obligations, were only to be reconciled by his total want of reli∣gion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. i. p. 684, gives an instance of his religious reverence, after the battle of Tewksbury, when entering a church with his sword drawn, where several of his soes had taken sanctuary, he was met by a priest bearing the elements, who demanded pardon for the refugees, which, in regard to the sacred exhibi∣tion, or to the sanctity of the priest, he granted.</NOTE>; yet we find under this character one of the most prosperous of men.</P>
<P>On his demise, his eldest son Edward, then twelve years of age, was proclaimed his successor, by the title of Edward V. but he was never crowned; his uncle Richard duke of Gloucester ascending the throne on the 20th or 22d<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">According to Sir Thomas More.</NOTE> day of June 1483, and being crowned king of England on the 6th day of July following, in deprivation of the family, of his brothers Edward IV. and the duke of Clarence. The very means he used to give a countenance to his claim, was the fatal allegation Edward published to reconcile the execution of the duke of Clarence, <HI>that he had affirmed the king was not the issue of the duke of York.</HI> Rapin's words on this occa∣sion are, <Q>Herein must be admired the blindness of men, and the justice of Heaven: “Edward makes use of a false accusation to put his brother to death, and thereby ”created suspicions, which were to serve thereafter to ruin his own children.</Q> Afterwards Edward V. and the duke of York his brother, then nine years of age, were removed with such art and secrecy, that their fate remains to this day uncer∣tain. The duke of Clarence's children, being yet unpurged of their father's at∣tainder, were esteemed incapable of inheritance, so that Richard held the diadem in a specious security.</P>
<P>After being a witness to such revolutions, bishop Dudley departed this life on the 29th of November 1483, and was interred in St Nicholas' chapel in West∣minster Abbey, where his monument yet remains, with his essigies inlaid with brass, and this epitaph round the margin: <HI>Hic jacet Gulielmus de Dudley, e familia Baronum de Dudley, Dunelm.

<P>The short time bishop Dudley held this bishopric, and the troubles which pre∣vailed in the state during that period, will in a great measure account for the want of public works within this province, and the barrenness of records in his time<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Godwin. —Newcourt's Rep.

This he observes could not be done without a vast expence, as might be easily conceived from the bishop's being obliged to keep a hundred mercenary soldiers in one of his castles, even in time of peace. "What then is to be thought," adds he, "of the whole number of his castles and other places, especially in the time of the present most grievous war, that we are carrying on with the most fierce and hardy nation of the Scots?" He observes further, that the castles and towns belonging to the church at Durham were in so ruinous a state, partly through the negligence of preceding bishops, and partly by the devas∣tations committed by the Scots, that the revenues of several years would not be sufficient to restore them. Such representations were in many instances deviations from truth.

Henry earl of Richmond, of the Lancastrian line, by a contract of mar∣riage with Elizabeth the eldest daughter of Edward IV, mounted the throne, un∣der a plausible countenance of conciliating the dissentions of the two houses. by uniting their claims: And so rejoiced were the people on their release from a ty∣rant, whom historians could not sufficiently condemn to posterity, and so happily were they flattered with the idea of terminating the dissentions which so long had divided and distracted the state, that, without examining Henry's title, he was re∣ceived with universal acclamations, and in the year 1485 raised to the throne, by the title of Henry the Seventh.</P>
<P>The bishop is not named in any commission in this king's reign; and indeed it is probable, in the rebellion of Lambert Simnel, aided by John de la Pole earl of Lincoln, in the year 1487, that many of the people of the palatinate and more northern counties, who retained their old affection for the Warwicks, were en∣gaged in the insurrection, and not without the countenance of our prelate. Hen∣ry VII. made a progress personally through the northern parts, and carried on a severe inquisition against those concerned in that rebellion. In the bishop's re∣cords, Rot. A. N<SUP>o</SUP> 19, by virtue of the royal mandate to him directed, a com∣mission is issued to enquire <HI>de insurrectionibus infra regiam libertatem Dunelm.</HI> The bishop of Durham was assuredly a person in whom the king put no immediate con∣fidence; for whilst he was in the north for the purposes aforesaid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rym. Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. vol. xii. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>8.</NOTE>, he sent from Newcastle, (at which place he had arrived about the middle of August<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2.</NOTE>), into Scotland, Richard Fox bishop of Exeter, (afterwards translated to Durham), and Sir Richard Edgecombe comptroller of the household, to treat with the Scottish king about finally composing all disputes between the kingdoms.</P>
<P>In 1488 the king was assiduous in levying the supplies granted by parliament, and all the counties, except Yorkshire and the bishopric of Durham, readily sub∣mitted to the tax; but in those parts, where the friends of the house of York yet remained very numerous, it was not collected with the same ease. Some factious persons stirring up the people, the collectors met with so much opposition, that they applied for aid to Henry Percy earl of Northumberland, then chief in power in the northern parts, who immediately gave notice at court, and demand∣ed instructions: The king's reply was, that he would not remit any part of what
<PB N="368" REF="415"/>his parliament had granted, both on account of his pressing necessities, and also to prevent other counties petitioning for a like relaxation. Upon this answer, the earl of Northumberland assembled the principal men of this province and the ad∣jacent parts, and in imperious terms demanded immediate compliance. The de∣termined phrase in which the earl addressed the people, served only to enflame the secret sentiments of their minds, which were already adverse to the king's inte∣rests; and in their wrath they conceived, that the earl had encouraged the king to this rigour. A mob instantly arose, and beset the earl's house of Cocklodge, near Thirsk, whither he had retired, and slew him with several of his attendants. An enflamed populace seldom stop at one act of outrage; their numbers increased, their purposes were enlarged to more extensive views, and, setting Sir John Egre∣mont at their head, they threatened to march to the capital, and demand redress sword in hand. The insurrection wore so serious a countenance, that the king dispatched the earl of Surry with such forces as were ready, whilst he prepared to follow and support him at the head of a powerful army; but by the earl's alacrity the rebels were soon dispersed. The king, however, pursued his journey to York, where he caused some of the chiefs to be executed; and leaving the earl lord pre∣sident of the north, and Sir Richard Tunstal his commissioner to levy the tax with∣out remittance, he returned to London<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rapin.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is not certain whether the bishop was resident in his See at the time of the commotions occasioned by Perkin Warbeck; but it is rather to be presumed, he went over to the continent, on the same errand with several others, to visit the duchess of Burgundy, and assist in council for the cause of the house of York; for he died at Rome in the month of January, 1493; no reason being assigned by historians for his journey thither; and immediately on his death being known in England, his effects were sequestered by the crown<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ob. ante 4th Feb. 1492.

From hence we learn, that the prelates of Durham had now lost the privilege granted them by Edw. IV. of making their own puncheons or dies for coining their own money, and were obliged to receive them from the treasurer and barons of the exchequer, as was no doubt the custom before the reign of Rich. III. As no halfpennies are here mentioned, it is probable ”the coining of them was now disused, and probably never again revived.</Q>— He gives a<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See plate of coinage, letter I.</NOTE> specimen of one of bishop Sherwood's pennies, and says, <Q>This is “a very curious and valuable penny; the epigraphe upon the obverse is RICAR∣DUS REX ANGLIE; upon the king's breast is a cross, to denote that it is a prelatical coin; upon this side is the boar's head for the mint-mark, which was the usual cognizance of this king, and is the most common mint-mark of any upon the regal money of this reign; the legend upon the reverse is CIVITAS DVNOLM. Before we appropriate the money coined at Durham in the reign of Hen. VII. to its particular prelates, it will be proper to take a short view of the Durham coinage, and to lay down some particular rules to go by, in dis∣tinguishing the episcopal money of this palatinate at this period. We have no money of this king's first coinage, which represents him with a sull face, either of the Durham, or any other mint; but many of that city are to be found of his second coinage. It must here be observed, that the money under∣went a great alteration with respect to the type in this reign; the pennies have always the sovereigns crowned, seated in a chair, with the scepter in one hand, and the orb in the other, with the king's name and title in the le∣gend: This type Mr Snelling supposed was borrowed from the sovereign, of gold, as probably it was. Upon the reverse appear the arms of France and England quarterly; and those coined at Durham are almost constantly with the initial of the sur or christian name of the bishop in whose mints they were struck, on one side of the shield; with a D for the initial of Durham on the other: By attending to the former, we shall be certain to know to which of the prelates they belong. One of these pennies has the initial of both the christian and surname of the bishop, and most of them have either a mitre or a crosier on some part of them, still further to denote that they are episcopal money; yet neither Mr Leake nor Mr Snelling appropriate any of these coins to any of the bishops. The first gentleman, notwithstanding the proofs above given of these letters answering to these bishops names, says, that they must be for the minter, as they do not answer to any bishop of this See. It is well
<PB N="370" REF="417"/>known we have no mint-master's name upon our money since the reign of Edw. I. nor was it ever placed in this manner; add to which, we have con∣stantly a D for one of the letters, for <HI>Dunelmensis,</HI> except in a single instance, which has both the initials of the bishops names. Mr Leake is therefore mis∣taken in saying, that they do not answer to any bishop of this See. These let∣ters have nothing to do with the minter, but are either for the christian or sur∣name of the bishop, and the name of the place of coinage. This is further confirmed, by our having letters placed, as these are, upon the archiepiscopal money of Canterbury and York; but as there were more bishops of this See, during the reigns of Hen. VII. and Hen. VIII. than of the two former, there is a greater variety of these letters upon the money of Durham, particularly as some of the bishops put the initial of their christian, and others their sur∣name; one of bishop Sherwood's has the initial of both names, and some of the bishops have the first letter of their christian name on some of their money, and that of their surname upon others: But what has most confounded our antiquarians, probably is, that sometimes the initial of the christian name of one bishop answers to the surname of another; and so on the contrary, the initial of the surname of one answers to another's christian name; in one instance, two of the bishops have the same christian name, and in another we have two bishops whose surnames begin with the same letter. We cannot however suppose, but these prelates had some particular rule of placing these letters, to distinguish their own money from that of the preceding bishop; and this is the fact, for by pursuing the following very simple mode, we shall be sure to discover by what prelate the piece was coined, which is this,—when the ini∣tial of the prelate's name is the first letter, such initial respects the bishop's Christian name, and consequently when it is set after the D it will be for the bishop's surname; and this is a general rule. By an indenture dated the 20th of September 1490, this prelate appointed George Stryall, of Durham, gold∣smith, to work his mint in that city, from the feast of St Michael then next for three years, paying four marks yearly to the warden of the Tower of London<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The four marks paid to the warden of the Tower was probably a duty for the stamps, which all the charter mints were obliged to pay.—See Pegge's 'Essay on the Origin of the Metropolitical and other sub∣ordinate Mints,' p. 89, 90, 91.</NOTE>, and he with several others became bound to the bishop in 300<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> that what mo∣ney he coined should be of the same alloy, assay, and weight, as that coined in the Tower of London<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">From the close rolls in the chancery at Durham, 5 Hen.

<P>The See of Durham continued vacant until the month of Decemb. A.

On the 7th day of De∣cember, 1494, RICHARD FOX was translated by the king from the See of Bath and Wells to the bishopric of Durham; and had the temporalties restored the next day. He was the son of Thomas Fox, a person of inferior circumstances, and was born at Ropesly, near
<PB N="372" REF="420"/>Grantham, in Lincolnshire, about the latter end of the reign of Hen. VI. Was educated at Magdalen college, in Oxford, where he distinguished himself for his genius and close application; but the plague obliging him to retire from thence, he removed to Pembroke-hall, in Cambridge: Wren, bishop of Ely, in his ac∣count of the masters of that college, expresses a doubt, whether he was ever a fellow there<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a question whether he was ever fellow of the college; for in the letter which the fellows sent to Labourne upon his election, they tell him, there was not a man in England, bred in the college, besides him∣self, that was worthy of that place.—Wren's Masters of Pembroke Hall.—Lel. Col. vol. v. p. 389.</NOTE>. When he had staid a competent time in Cambridge, he went for improvement to Paris, where he studied divinity and the canon law; and whilst there, had the degree of doctor of laws conferred on him. In France he became acquainted with Morton, bishop of Ely, who fled thither during the usur∣pation of Richard III. by whom, most probably, he was introduced to Henry earl of Richmond, who was then meditating a descent upon England, in order to de∣throne the usurper; and, with the rest of the English who were at Paris, he bound himself by oath to take part with the earl. Richmond accordingly received Dr Fox into secret samiliarity; and having applied to Charles VIII. king of France, for assistance in his enterprize; and being called away, before he could complete his negociation, he left the prosecution of this important matter to the doctor, whom he thought the fittest man to manage an affair of such consequence: Nor was he deceived in him; for he conducted himself with such assiduity, atten∣tion, and prudence, that he soon obtained men and money from the court of France, and was otherwise greatly instrumental in Henry's acquisition of the throne of England<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Richardus Fox focius, legum Dr Parisiis, dum res regis Henrici septimi in Galliis ageret, quem rex summo favore complexus est, quia illius solummodo gratia Carolus octavus, Gallorum rex, illum ad huc comitem Richmondiae idque exulantem ad regnum contra Richardum tyrannum repetendum auxiliaribus copijs relevabat.

After the earl had gained the battle of Bosworth, and in consequence seized the crown, he appointed Dr Fox one of his privy counsellors; about the same time collated him to the prebend of Bishopston, in the church of Sarum; and in the year 1486, to that of South Grantham, in the same church: In the same year, or beginning of 1487, he was promoted to the bishopric of Exeter, and appointed keeper of the privy seal; which dignities he held at the time he was the king's commissioner in Scotland before-mentioned. He was also made principal secretary of state, and master of St Cross hospital, near Winchester; and was translated to the See of Bath and Wells in the year 1491, and from thence to Durham in 1494. Was appointed by the See of Rome legate in Scot∣land. He stood sponsor for Henry VIII. and was at that time master of Pembroke∣hall.</P>
<P>The state of Scotland had undergone a new revolution, by the murder of James III. on whose death his son was proclaimed his successor, and crowned by the title of James the Fourth; with whom several negociations were carried on for repeated truces, which kept the borders free from open invasion; though from the intestine troubles of Scotland, frequent skirmishes, with various success, hap∣pened on the marches.</P>
<PB N="373" REF="421"/>
<P>In the year 1494, bishop Fox, with four others, were commissioned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xii. p. 554, 555.</NOTE> to meet the delegates of the Scottish king at Coldstream or some other convenient place, to conclude a lasting peace, or obtain a continuance of the truce, and to fettle the mutual damages occasioned by violations of the former articles. It does not ap∣pear that this negociation was effectual; for in the opening of the year 1495, the king, apprehensive of an invasion in support of the pretensions of the impostor Warbeck, gave commission to thomas earl of Surry<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>3.</NOTE>, vice-warden of the West and middle marches under Henry duke of York, the king's infant son, to array and lead forth all the fighting men between Tweed and Trent. The like commis∣sion was granted to bishop Fox, then lord privy seal, for Northumberland, Dur∣ham, Tyndale, and Redesdale, with the districts adjacent<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 569.</NOTE>. Some short time afterwards, the duke of York was constituted warden-general of all the marches, and on account of his youth had assigned under him vice-wardens, of whom the bishop of Durham was one. The king of England, in order to secure as much as possible the affections and interests of the Scottish court, in this year commissioned the bishop of Durham, William earl of Carlisle, Thomas earl of Surry, Ralph Neville, lord Neville, Sir Thomas Dacre of Dacre, and Sir William Tyler; and the commission was renewed to the same persons on the 2d of Septem∣ber in the following year, to negociate a marriage between Margaret his daugh∣ter and the king of Scotland<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">In each of those commissions, any two had a power to act, whereof the bishop of Durham was to be one; and a secret commission was also given to the Bishop, si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly, of the sune date <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith the letter. But they all proved abortive.</NOTE>: But the influence of foreign courts prevailed, and the adventurer was graciously received in Scotland; a numerous army was raised, which the king commanded in person; and with a few foreign troops, that Warbeck brought with him, they entered Northumberland. The king of Scotland soon discovered that the attempt would prove fruitless, as not one Englishman of consequence joined the army, and they did not receive the least hopes of support from any quarter. This induced the Scots to quit the thoughts of advancing into the country; the army was thrown into divisions for the sake of pillaging; and after collecting a vast booty, they retired, on receiving intelligence that the English army was approaching.</P>
<P>Parliament, in the following year, granted the king a supply of 120,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> to support the Scottish war; a much larger sum than had ever been granted on a like occasion. A tax so grievous caused much murmuring, and in Cornwall an insur∣rection was the consequence. The king of Scotland took advantage of those troubles to enter the borders; with one division of his army he laid siege to Nor∣ham, whilst the other laid waste and ravaged the country. The king in person conducted the siege, but found a resistance he did not expect; for the bishop of Durham had not only garrisoned the fortress with chosen troops, under experi∣enced leaders, but also had thrown into it great store of provision and supplies, and put all the works into complete repair. On hearing that this castle was closely besieged, and the attacks carried on with great vigour, the bishop resorted thither
<PB N="374" REF="422"/>with a reinforcement for the garrison; and having gained entrance for himself and party, he conducted the defence in so judicious a manner, that each assault was re∣sisted, and the Scottish army foiled in every attack; but the outworks of the castle suffered much damage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buchannan.—Hollingsh. p. 289.</NOTE>. The bishop had also put into a posture of defence every other strong-hold in the country, where he secured the cattle and valuable effects of the inhabitants, so as to disappoint the marauding parties of their expected booty. These matters, together with the news of the king of England's success against the Welsh insurgents, and the earl of Surry's approach with the northern troops, in∣duced the king of Scotland to raise the siege, and draw off his forces. The earl of Surry soon afterwards entered Scotland, but immediately a negociation for peace took place, and no blow of consequence was struck by the English; for Henry was so intent on his project of a peace and alliance with Scotland, that, at the very instant his forces were entering Scotland, he gave a commission to the bi∣shop of Durham and others, to treat with the ministers of that state. Peter d'Ayala, a clergyman, envoy from the court of Spain, then in England, was employed by the king as a mediator. He was a person of acute penetration and excellent parts, had much skill in negociations of this nature, and was of great service therein; for, by his conduct and address, a truce was obtained for seven years, and the bi∣shop of Durham was nominated one of the conservators. In 1499 some amend∣ments were made in the articles of truce, and the bishop of Durham was also a conservator, then named. This treaty was drawn up and signed by the plenipo∣tentiaries of the two states, in Stirling castle; and eight days after, on the 20th of July, at the same place, it was ratified by the king of Scotland. An accident which happened about this time was near destroying what had been effected with so much attention: In the intercourse which immediately took place between the people of both nations, on the borders, some Scottish youths came upon a party of pleasure to Norham; the garrison thought they were too speculative, and paid too near at∣tention to the works of the castle, considering the recent hostilities between the states: The centinels, in a manner offensive to the Scots, prevented their curiosity, and a fray began, in which some were slain. Complaint was immediately made to the English wardens, who not granting a satisfactory redress without delay, the king of Scotland sent his herald to demand the same of the king, and, on refusal, to denounce war. King Henry returned a gentle answer, expressive of his wil∣lingness to grant the redress required, but at the same instant declaring his igno∣rance of the matter. the bishop of Durham wanted not genius to carry his mas∣ter's placid purposes to effect; and taking on himself the burthen of making the re∣quired satisfaction, as the fortress was his where the offence was given, he exerted himself to put a stop to the mischievous consequences: He wrote letters to the king of Scotland in so persuasive and conciliating a stile, that his mind was immedi∣ately moved in his favour, and he wished to have an interview with one who had such power to charm his passions, and silence his wrath: In this the king had a more extensive view; for by such an interview, he hoped a plan might be promoted for the mutual benefit of both kingdoms. Wharton's expressions on this occasion
<PB N="375" REF="423"/>are remarkably strong: "Then king James revealed the secret of his bosom, his ardent wish that the princess Margaret might become his queen." And, speaking of the bishop's negociation on this important occasion, he says, <HI>"Aeternae felicita∣tis fundamenta genti nostrae posuit."</HI> As soon as the king of Scotland's desire was made known to the bishop, he obtained his sovereign's permission to visit Scot∣land, and met K. James at Melros-abbey, when a negociation for an alliance was en∣tered into; but a dispensation from the pope being necessary, on account of the princess's age and consanguinity of the parties, it was near two years before the treaty was concluded, the bishop being previously translated to Winchester.</P>
<P>William de Chambrè tells us, this translation was occasioned by a controversy which arose between the bishop and the earl of Cumberland, touching their right to the town of Hartlepool; but he is in an error as to the name of the earl, the dispute being with the earl of Northumberland. The ferocious manners of the borderers were not yet corrected; from a habit of warfare they retained the savage disposition which accustomed rapine and bloodshed confirmed into a brutal state of mind, a fierce and impetuous temper, which submitted not to controul, and knew no other rule than arbitrary will. The influence of the church began to decline, the fetters of superstition were loosened, and the terrors of religious judgment re∣laxed, so that the minds of men were hastily returning back to the original fero∣city, which was left to succeeding ages to expel, by learning and an intimate ac∣quaintance with arts and sciences, that have civilized what religion left unsubdued.</P>
<P>As to the bishop's public works in this See, other than as before noted, they were few. He made some alterations in the great hall of the castle: It is described as having two princely seats, one at each end; the lower seat he removed, and converted that space into offices, making a gallery for musicians above, where they should perform during the time of serving up the courses<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Out of a great vast hall in the castle there, he took as much away as made a fair buttery and a pantry, even to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e pulpits or galleries on each side of the hall, wherein the trumpeters or wind-music used to stand to play while the meat was ushered in: And on the wall which parted the said buttery from the hall, was a great pelican set up, to shew that it was done by him, because he gave the pelican to his arms. Bishop Reise afterwards took away part of the said hall at the other end.—Wood's Athenae Oxon. vol. i. p. 665.</NOTE>: He added a spacious kitchen, with apartments for a steward, and all offices thereto appertaining, to the west of the hall, at a considerable expence. In this hall he entertained the prin∣cess Margaret and her retinue, as she advanced into Scotland, on her espousal with James IV, on the 23d of July, being the anniversary of his installation, when he caused to be served up a high feast, called, by old writers, <HI>a double-dinner</HI> and <HI>a double-supper:</HI> Perhaps two courses are what is meant by the expression. There were present all the nobility and people of distinction of the northern parts, as well spiritual as temporal. On this occasion there were, in the train of officers belong∣ing to the bishop, some never before remarked in any record, viz. "Officers of armes and serjeants of armes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Fian<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lls of the Princess Marg. written by John Young, Somerset, herald.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>The bishop had entered upon a noble design, to repair the great tower of the castle of Durham, which is capable of being made one of the most magnificent erections in the north of England: He began to construct a hall therein, with a
<PB N="376" REF="424"/>kitchen and other apartments; but before he advanced far in the plan, he was translated from the See. By the excellent taste this prelate shewed in the few sumptuous buildings he made, it is greatly to be lamented he did not carry his in∣tention, respecting the above alterations, into full execution. The tower in its present state is a most noble monument of antiquity, but under bishop Fox's de∣sign would have become an excellent ornament of this ancient city. Godwin says, he walled in a large park for deer near Durham, but doth not give it a name<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Browne Willis says it was Auckland Park.</NOTE>. In the years 1501 and 1502 he was chancellor of the university of Cambridge.</P>
<P>Bishop Fox continued to have great weight and influence in all public affairs during the whole reign of Henry VII. who appointed him one of his executors, and particularly recommended him to his son and successor Henry VIII. Lord Bacon observes, that bishop Fox was <Q>a wise man, and one that could see through “the present to the future:" And he also says, "that cardinal Morton and bi∣shop Fox were vigilant men and secret, and such as kept watch with the king<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Henry VII.</NOTE> almost upon all men else: They had both been versed in his affairs before he came ”to the crown, and were partakers of his adverse fortune.</Q> But upon the acces∣sion of Henry VIII. Fox's influence greatly declined at court, though he was in∣strumental in promoting the rise of Wolsey, in opposition to the earl of Surry. In 1510, notwithstanding his decline of power, he was sent ambassador to France, in conjunction with the earl of Surry, and Ruthal then bishop of Durham, when a treaty of alliance was concluded with Lewis XII. About that time, a sharp dis∣pute arose between him and archbishop Warham, concerning the extent of the jurisdiction of the prerogative court: The argument at length became so violent, that an appeal was made to the pope; but it being referred back to the king, in 1513 he determined it amicably. In the summer of that year, he attended the king, in his expedition into France, with a large retinue, and was at the taking of Terouenne: In a short time afterwards, in conjunction with Thomas Gray, mar∣quis of Dorset, he concluded a new treaty with the emperor Maximilian against France. In 1515, being no longer able to bear the repeated mortifications he received from cardinal Wolsey, to whose rise he had greatly contributed, he with∣drew, in deep chagrin, to his own diocese.</P>
<P>Being highly displeased with the fellows of his own college of Pembroke-hall, particularly one Hudson, and desirous of effecting some great work to the ad∣vancement of literature and the benefit of posterity, (great veneration in that age being paid by ecclesiastics to the name and body of Christ) he was induced, by his intimate friend Oldham, bishop of Exeter, in the year 1516, to found Corpus Christi college in Oxford: Oldham was very rich, and, joining him in the pro∣ject, greatly contributed to this foundation. Wren says, by Oldham's means "he effected his purpose, and saved much money<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. vol. v. p 204, 390.</NOTE>." This seems rather invidious, and inspires an unfavourable idea of our prelate's character. He had the misfortune to lose his sight about ten years before his decease, when he began to conceive an idea of erecting some religious and public work; and intimated to his friend the
<PB N="377" REF="425"/>bishop of Exeter his intention of founding a monastery. It is said, Oldham, who had much foresight and sagacity in such matters, persuaded him to found the col∣lege before-mentioned; telling him with a true, prophetic spirit, "that the monks already possessed so much, it was not possible they could hold it long." This shews, that their enormities were then become flagrant, and their extensive proper∣ties a political grievance, which brought on their dissolution in the succeeding reigns.</P>
<P>In 1522, the bishop founded a free-school at Taunton, in Somersetshire, where <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had a fine manor as bishop of Winchester; and there built a convenient house for the master. He did the same at Grantham, near the place of his nativity. He attended parliament in 1523, though he had lost his sight some years before. Cardinal Wolsey would have taken advantage of his infirmities, and persuaded him to resign his bishopric to him for a pension; but the bishop resisted all his insinuations and wiles; and by the messenger who was entrusted to conduct his in∣sidious projects, he returned the cardinal a message to this purpose, "That though by reason of his blindness he was not able to distinguish black from white, yet he could discern between true and false, right and wrong, and plainly dis∣covered, without eyes, the malice of an ungrateful man: That it behoved the cardinal to take care, not to be so blinded with ambition, as not to foresee his own end: He need not trouble himself with the bishopric of Winchester, but ra∣ther should mind the king's affairs."</P>
<P>In the year 1518, the bishop resigned the mastership of Pembroke-hall. He built an elegant chapel at Winchester; at which place he died, in the year 1528; and was interred in his own chapel, his essigies in marble being placed upon his tomb<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This monument is a most finished specimen of the improved Gothic; there is no inscription to his me∣mory, but he is represented by the effigles of a skeleton. Within the chapel, there is a small oratory, called Fox's Study, which he usually frequented for his devotion.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There are no records of note in this province during bishop Fox's time, but some commissions of array, patents of officers, and a pardon for an alienation with∣out licence by Chr.

<P>As to this bishop's mintage, Mr Noble's account is, that <Q>bishop Fox, by his “indenture dated 20th Jan. 1495, appointed, during pleasure, Wm Richerdson, of Durham, yeoman, chief master of the mint: The money coined by him was to be of the same weight and fineness as the regal money, and the bishop co∣venanted to give him for his services the same emoluments as the masters and workers in the regal mint received; and also, that the chancellor of the bishop∣ric,

He also co∣venanted to indemnify the bishop against the merchants for the money that should be brought to the mint to be coined; and, as a security for the perform∣ance of such covenant, he, with several others, were bound in the sum of 200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This indenture maide betwix the rev'rende fadre in God Rychard by the g'ce of God bisshop of Duresme on the one partye and Willyam Richerdson of the said Duresme yeoman on that other partye witnesseth that the said rev'rend fadir g'unteth and by this indenture hath maide ordeigned and established the forseid Willyam maist' and workman of his mony of silver in his palice of Duresme aforeseid to have hold and occupye by hym or his sufficynte deputye as long as it shall pleas the said rev'rend fadre and the said Wil∣lyam hath undertaken afor the seid rev'rend fadre to make the same mony undir the p'ill and fourme followyng that is to say to make the peny called the st'leng in the nombre of pounde Troye <HI>cccciiij.</HI><SUP>xx</SUP> peo'es in the pounde weight and the moneye shall be in syness accordyng to the sylver money of our soveraigne lord the kyng maid in his mynte withyn his toure of London that is to say the pounde weight of the seid monye shall hold and be <HI>xj</HI> unces and two peny weigh of fyne silver and <HI>xviij</HI> d weight of alaie w'ich is the right stan∣derd of the money of England And the said rev'red fadre g'unteth to the said Willyam lyke remedyes in ev'ry pounde weight in weight and in alaie as the kyng g'unteth unto the maistres and workers of his mo¦ny within the tow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e aforeseid that is to say two peny weight in the weight of ev'ry pounde and <HI>ij</HI> d. weight in the allaie above the standard or undre or <HI>ij</HI> d. weight in bothe and that of all such moneys that the said Willyam shall make within the mynte aforeseid it shall be lawful for the chancellor of the bysshoprick of the said bisshop for the tyme beyng comptrouller of the same mynte to take upp of ev'ry pounde weight of silver a peny which money so taken shall be put in a bagge bye the seid Willyam and the same bagge put in a coffer with two lokkys of the which one key shall remayne with the seid comptrouller and the other with the forseid Willyam And forthermore the same Willyam Rycherdson graunteth and covenneth that the forseid mony by him made shal be well and p'sitly prented coined and fine fashioned with a prevy marke in the prente such as the seid busshop shall appoynte so that it may be evydently knowen from odre mony conterseted Also the same Willyam g'unteth by theis pr'sentez to save defend and save harm∣less the forseid rev'rend sad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e a gaynste the m'rchaunte or m'rchauntez for all mony that is brought to the seid mynte to be coinned for the which and all other theis pr'missez aforsaid duly and effectually to be kepte and p'sormed in ev'ry p'rte by the said Willyam the same Willyam Rycherdson with Robt Blounte of Duresme, Willyam Tychburn of the same William P'ley of the same and Cuthberte Thompson of the same bindeth themselsf by an obligacyon beryng date <HI>xxiiij.</HI> day of January the yere of the reigne of our so∣v'raigne lord the kyng Henry <HI>vijth</HI> the xth in <HI>cc</HI> lb to be payd to the forseid rev'rend fadre or his assignez as in the seid obligacyon more planly doth appere if ev'ry p'te or p'cell of the forseid coven'ntys be by the seid Willyam be broken or not obs'ved as is before specifyed In witness whereof the seide p'tyes enterchaungeably have put to their sealys yeven the <HI>xxth</HI> day of January the yere of the reigne of our sov'raigne lord the kyng Henre <HI>vijth</HI> the xth.</NOTE> What the peculiar distinctions were, is uncertain, as we have none until the 18th year of this reign; but after that time, both the regal and prelatical mo∣ney ”is numerous.</Q></P>

This is the first time we have the name of the city so spelt, and the general way we find it upon the money of the succeeding bishops. Upon the arms of the chair on the obverse, and the extremity of the upright of the cross, are mitres, though imperfectly represented; on the sides of the shield, near the bottom, are the letters R.

None of the above have any mint-mark.—It may be thought not a little extraordinary, that we should have several specimens of this bishop's mo∣ney coined in the year 1502 (which was that of the re-coinage) and none before, either of his or of his predecessor's in this reign. However, the above pennies were certainly struck in this year, in which this prelate was also translated to Winchester, and the type of them will not let us suppose they were coined before: This may be accounted for, from the great quantity of money that must have been coined at this time, both in the royal and charter mints, to sup∣ply the place of that sent in to be re-coined; and as the penny was the most cur∣rent sort then used (and consequently would be the most worn and defaced) it may be the reason why the pennies struck in this reign, before the 18th year, ”have entirely disappeared.</Q></P>

<P>After bishop Sever's death, the See continued vacant for two years: Nothing appears to have occasioned this neglect of the palatinate, except that the king was given up to avarice, and indulged his desire of riches at the expence of his dignity and justice, and heaped up wealth, by authorising every rapacious act the tools of his power could carry into execution; and it is more than probable the revenues of the bishopric were the temptations to this delay. During the vacancy, the crown supplied all the great offices of the palatinate: Thomas Castell, prior of Durham, with William Bulmer, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> were appointed guardians of the temporal∣ties, the 21st day of May 1505. Bulmer, who was high sheriff in bishop Sever's time, was re-appointed on the 14th day of June, and Thomas Reydmayn was also re-appointed on the 3d day of July, to the escheatorship; Robert Chambre, who held the chancellorship and great seal, was re-appointed on the 13th day of June 1505<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rot.

Pits assures us, that Bainbrigg had been very intimate with Mor∣ton archbishop of Canterbury, and shared in that prelate's sufferings during the usurpation of Richard III, after whose death his affairs took a more prosperous turn, for he was appointed almoner to Henry VII, and employed by that prince on several embassies to the emperor Maximilian, Charles VIII. of France, and other potentates of Europe<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pits, de illustr. Angl. Scriptor. in Append. Centaur. vol. i. p. 48.</NOTE>. He distinguished himself chiefly by his embassy from Henry VIII. to pope Julius II, touching the Venetians, wherein he attempted their reconciliation with the pope. To effect this matter, he mingled his own interests with those of this prince; and, having an eye on the vacant cardinal's hat, carried on his negociations with so much artifice and disguise at the outset, that the real intentions of his master were not discovered. In the sequel, the pope, quarrelling with France, sought to gain the king of England to his interest; and therefore ho∣noured his embassador, by creating him a cardinal, and giving him a precedency which belonged of right to the archbishop of Siponto, as being the eldest prelate in that promotion. It is asserted, in his monumental inscription, that he was cre∣ated cardinal for the eminent services done to the holy See; but, if Mr Aubrey has set the affair in a true light, the red hat was rather the motive to, than the conse∣quence of his merit; rather the bribe, than the reward of his services<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Biog.

This prelate died at Rome on the 14th day of July 1514, being poi∣soned by one of his domestics, in revenge for some blows he had given him. M. Aubrey says, that the cardinal one day, being in a violent passion, to which he was naturally subject, fell upon his <HI>major domo,</HI> one Renaud, of Modena, and beat him excessively, which the enraged domestic revenged by a dose of poison he found means to administer.

Richard Pace, dean of St Paul's, was in the cardinal's service, and with him at Rome at the time of his death: He transmitted to the king an account of the manner of it, and of the measures taken to discover those who were concerned therein. He lamented some reproaches which had been thrown on his deceased master by the bishop of Worcester: "Though my lord," said he, <Q>had sum vices, yett he was the most faytheful “man to hys prince that evyr was borne, and ever watchful for the good of the king's highness and his native country, notwithstanding the insinuations that ”have been made to the contrary<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See this letter among the collections at the end of Fiddes's Life of Wolfey.</NOTE>.</Q> Ciaconius says<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Alfrid Ciacon.

Pits commends him for his great learning; and tells us he wrote many things in the civil law, and some accounts of his own em∣bassies, nothing of which has come down to us: But a foreign author, (Paris de Grassi) has given a very different idea of the cardinal's abilities, and relates, that before his advancement to the purple, being one day to return thanks to the pope and sacred college for the honour done to the king his master in sending him the golden rose, was forced to break off his speech, and to quit the consistory in great confusion: And the like disgrace befel him when cardinal, a few days after his promotion; for it being his lot to thank the dean of the sacred college, in the name of all the new cardinals, he was again at a loss, and, what was still worse, spoke directly contrary to the instructions given him by the master of the ceremo∣nies, which were, to divide his speech into four points; to magnify in the first, the dignity of the cardinalate; to lessen, in the second, the merit of himself and his associates; in the third, to extol the goodness and condescension of the pope; and to end with compliments of thanks, and offers of their most humble service<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Biog.

<P>The See continued vacant until the month of April following the translation of bishop Bainbrigg; but it does not appear that the crown appointed any guardian of the temporalties, and the civil offices were all retained during the vacancy. This singular circumstance might arise from the king's indisposition, whose gouty habit now shewed itself in dangerous symptoms; for having fallen on his lungs, it threatened a speedy dissolution: He lingered for some months, and at length de∣parted this life on the 22d of April, 1509. Arthur his eldest son being dead without issue, he was succeeded by his second son, who assumed the sceptre by the title of Henry VIII.</P>
<PB N="386" REF="434"/>
<P>The reader is now entering upon the most momentous period of our episcopal history, and approaching to a display of those distinguished characters in the annals of our palatinate as well as country at large, who brought about the greatest event in British history. In order to advance with due attention, the reader will recollect, that this palatinate was an ecclesiastical state in the most enlarged sense of the term; it was the only one in Britain; singular and unparal∣leled in this kingdom; governed by a potentate, in whom was united the prince and prelate, the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction; and though subject to the con∣stitutional laws of the empire at large, yet was governed by a viceroy holding a court of barons and privy council; and by a provincial, customary, or common law, and provincial officers of justice of every rank; an imperial mitre, and a popedom in miniature; holding the reins of civil government, and having an un∣limited authority over ecclesiastics and church affairs, without the controul and visitation of a metropolitan. Viewing our bishopric in this light, it may be neces∣sary to collect a general state of religious manners at this period, that we may be provided with due estimates and ideas, previous to our advancing to the material events of this reign.</P>
<P>The principles of Wycliffe and the reformers had made a slow progress, having been opposed with violent persecutions, and not by controversy and confutation: The church held abundant power, and the legislative authority nodded in fetters: The religion of the ecclesiastics was dissolved into shew and pageantry, piety and ener∣gy were forgotten, and the religion of the people was made up of superstition and practical services: The holiness of the mind, the religion of reason and of the soul, were buried with the fathers of the Saxon church: Pilgrimages, and the adoration of personages uncomprehended in the Trinity, veneration for saints' relics and holy rags, were the rage of the times: The care of the clergy was confined to the mainte∣nance of that grandeur and power, to which they had been rapidly advancing for two preceding centuries; and to that end they were for ever busied in extending their pri∣vileges, and protecting their rights from infringement and innovation: Discipline was neglected, and learning gone to decay: The clergy regarded their spiritual power and jurisdiction, only as the means of protecting their temporal rights from viola∣tion: The authority of the church was become the chief object with the religious: The papal power was increased to an enormous height; and though England held restrictive statutes for repressing all unconstitutional extension of jurisdiction here, yet they were left to sleep in oblivion; whilst innovations, like a flood, passed over the dormant powers: There was not a bishopric in England at this period that did not pass by Rome's provisional bull; nor a temporal matter of moment to the state, but what was dignified by her sanction. There is no occasion to go into a review of the more scandalous practices; let them sleep with the baleful ages in which they prevailed; it is enough to assert, that the extension of papal power was incompatible with the foundations of liberty our ancestors had provided. The corruptions which had crept into our own clergy are the proper subjects for our animadversions. The age was vicious and immoral: Luxury and all her train of contagious possessed the people: Pride, magnificence, and outward pomp, had contaminated every rank of men: Public spectacles and expensive enter∣tainments
<PB N="387" REF="435"/>were the occupations of every mind. In the beginning of Hen. VIII. 's reign,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert, Hale, &amp;c.</NOTE> he yielded himself wholly to the vices of the age, and all the propen∣sities of his youth: Every day he held tournaments, balls, concerts, feastings, and other expensive diversions; till, in a very short time, he had totally dissipa∣ted the immense sum of 180,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> with which his father's coffers were filled by every kind of extortion. The clergy were participators of these enormities; and cardinal Wolsey is charged with an ingenious invention towards such dissipa∣tions, in which he studied to have his sovereign immersed, that he might gain in∣fluence by cherishing his vices, and endear himself to his king by being the nurse of those very sins he ought to have repressed. Most of the bishops were promoted to their Sees for having rendered themselves serviceable to Rome, or to the depra∣ved passions of their sovereign; they were named from persons brought up at court, and trained in the maxims there practised: Real learning was scarce heard of in this aera: The canon law and school divinity were the accomplishments every student sought promotion by: The monks had filled the colleges, and occupied the professorships of the universities; by which means, philosophy and divinity were thrown aside, for a system of logical jargon which might furnish the dis∣putant with the art of wresting an argument. Every one saw the necessity there was of reforming the church, and bringing the corrupted ecclesiastics from their vices; but no potentate dared to make the attempt: The See of Rome itself shewed a consciousness of the necessity, but trembled to its foundation at the mea∣sures to effect it. It is wonderful to observe the progress by which Providence brings about the greatest events; involuntary agents are frequently the operators of divine will, and often the wicked hand of the determined spoiler brings about a blessing he could not comprehend: Thus the ravages of war have made a pas∣sage for the progress of arts; and the sword, embrued in blood, and extended by the hand of cruelty, hath led on the olives of religion and virtue, introduced the polity of distant states to dark and ignorant nations, and civilized the barbarity of the most savage people of the earth. The power of the church was grown enor∣mous, and the drones of religious societies had engrossed a vast territory in this kingdom; insomuch, that the civil jurisdiction was straitened, the state enfeebled, and a dreadful anarchy appeared to be approaching, which would in a short time have swallowed up the English monarchy. The churchmen, had many of them been virtuous, might have stayed the slood of donations, which were incessantly pouring in upon them from superstitious hands and terrified consciences; they might have corrected the vices of their houses, and the impieties of their breth∣ren. But the character given of them by John Huss and Jerome of Prague, at the hour of their condemnation, was too true: <Q>That the church of Rome, and “all the other churches in the world, were far swerved from the apostolical tra∣ditions: That the clergy ran after pleasures and riches: That they lorded it over the people, affected the highest feats at entertainments, and bred horses and dogs: That the revenues of the church, which belonged to the poor members of Christ, were consumed in vanity and wantonness: That the priests

The only public works within the province, attributed to him, were, the reparation of the south part of Tyne∣bridge, and building the great dining-hall in the palace at Auckland; which lat∣ter not being finished in his life-time, he left a sum of money to perfect the plan, and a workman of skill to see it executed.</P>
<P>In all the public transactions, of which our prelate had a part, or the palatinate was particularly interested, a second character seems so interwoven, that it appears impossible, with any degree of perspicuity, and without running into dull repeti∣tions in the progress of this work, to avoid carrying on an account of both persons, in the series of events to be related: This was Thomas Wolsey, the cotemporary and colleague of our prelate in state matters, and his successor in the bishopric.</P>
<P>Wolsey's birth and education are so well known, and the early events of his life have been displayed by so many writers, that the repetition here would not be pardoned. The bishop of Winchester was a very great advocate with Henry VIII. for Wolsey; he observed his active and penetrating mind, and hoped to lessen the interest of lord Surry, whom he hated, by encreasing the king's favour to this young and aspiring minister. The king made Wolsey his almoner<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"As fast as the other counsellors counselled the king to leave his pleasures and to attend to his assai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, so busily did the almoner perswade him to the contrary, which delighted him much, and caused him to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve the greater affection and love for the almoner. Thus the almoner <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uled all them that before ruled <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> did his policy and wit bring to pass."—Cavendish's MSS. in the Harleim Collection.</NOTE>; and soon afterwards presented him with the mansion-house of Empson, one of Henry VII.'s rapacious officers, who was convicted of high treason. In 1510, Wolsey was admitted a member of the privy council, and reporter of the proceedings in the star-chamber; and from thenceforth his promotions were rapid. He acquired a competent know∣ledge of his sovereign's disposition of mind, and the bent of his favourite passions, and thence derived his influence. He studied to indulge his love of ease, and at∣tachment to pleasures; sought every occasion to withdraw him from public business,
<PB N="390" REF="438"/>and to leave matters of state to the conduct of his ministers. He had a luxuriant imagination, and a genius calculated for gay exhibitions and expensive diversions: This faculty he exerted to immerse the king in voluptuous enjoyment, and spared no expence in the gratification of his sovereign's love of splendor and pleasure. The bishop of Winchester could not help murmuring, to see the treasures lavished away in idle sports and dissipations, which his old master, Henry VII, had amassed with so much care, pains, and injustice; "in which he himself had been employ∣ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rapin.</NOTE>." He charged the treasurer, lord Surry, as the chief cause: But as the whole court were gaining favours from the vices of the king, the bishop's pious clamours were despised; in a little time he retired in deep chagrin, under a decline of influ∣ence which he daily observed, and which brought him at length into contempt.</P>
<P>Wolsey, it is said, was a principle agent in instigating the king of England to engage in a war with France, in the year 1513; in the negociation of which mat∣ter with the pope, archbishop Bainbrigg was envoy at Rome. The motives which induced Wolsey to advise the war, and the events, are well known.</P>
<P>The king of England was no sooner on the continent, to prosecute the war there, than a herald was sent from Scotland to complain of injuries sustained from brea∣ches of truce by the borderers, coupled with assurances that the states were resolved to support their ally the king of France, in consequence of the several treaties sub∣sisting between the nations. This message was received by Henry when he lay be∣fore Tourenne, and the answer he gave, in the warmth of resentment and youthful rashness, was so full of contemptuous and harsh expressions, that the herald, on his return, refused to repeat them. The tenor of this answer was, an accusation against the Scottish king, <Q>of a breach of solemn oaths, a crime his progenitors were “charged with having been addicted to. He was upbraided with dishonourably taking advantage of Henry's absence; but as the fragility of his faith, and the whole tenor of his past conduct, had given too much ground for suspicion, he assured him precautions were taken, before the English army embarked, for the defence of England; and as he had shewn a soul susceptible of so little genero∣sity and princely truth, he would exclude him and his descendents from any pos∣sibility of succeeding to the crown of England, though he had been informed ”he had fixed an ambitious eye on that elevated dignity.</Q> It is evident this wrathful answer, so full of reproaches, did not influence the conduct of the king of Scotland, for, previous to the herald's arrival, the Scottish army had entered England, and their king had lost his life at the satal battle of Flodden-field.</P>
<P>A small body of troops, under the command of lord Hume, had entered England, and ravaged and laid waste the borders. The main body of the Scottish army, led by the king in person, followed by flow marches. Lord Surry, who was collecting the forces of the northern counties with all possible diligence, sent forward Sir William Bulmer with a troop of archers of this palatinate, who called to his aid the people of the English march, not exceeding in the whole one thousand men, formed an ambuscade in the deep broom which grew in some parts of M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>field plain, near the road the Scottish marauders must necessarily pass with their spoils,
<PB N="391" REF="439"/>and there put them to the rout. The Scottish leaders made several efforts to rally, and lead up their troops in order, but were not able to sustain the regular and heavy discharge of the archery: They left five hundred slain upon the field, and as many more were taken; lord Hume lost his standard, and his brother George was among the prisoners. The king of Scotland, eager to revenge this disgrace, proceeded with more speedy marches, and entered England on the 22d day of August 1513, at the head of an army of 60,000 men. The siege of Norham opened his military operations; the outworks were forced, one of the towers was beat down, and many of the garrison were slain at the first attack, so vigorously was the fortress assailed. The main tower held out for six days, and then capitulated; on which occasion the greatest part of the works were destroyed. The reduction of the castles of Etal, Wark, and Ford, followed. The king of Scotland did not pursue his advan∣tages, and march forward whilst the panic of his approach prevailed, but, fascinated by the lady of Ford castle, he loitered till the earl of Surry had collected his army, and was approaching him; which drew on the battle of Flodden-field, so fatal to the king and his people, on the 9th day of September. In the challenge sent by the earl of Surry to the Scottish king, from the camp of Wooler-Haugh, are the names of three distinguished persons of this palatinate, William Conyers, John Lumley, and Sir William Bulmer; and in the first line formed for that me∣morable battle, was Sir William Bulmer, with the forces of the bishopric of Dur∣ham. No mention is made of their numbers; but, from their station in the array, it is more than probable they won some of the chief honours of the day; for the earls of Lenox and Argyle making a fierce attack with their troops, armed with long pikes, on the right wing commanded by the lord-admiral, earl Surry's son, the con∣flict was desperate, and the event long dubious, till a reinforcement strengthened that part of the line, and gave the advantage to the English. Soon after that change of fortune, the English arms prevailed in every part of the field. It is probable all the forces of the palatinate were out upon this service; for when lord Surry marched his army northward through Durham, St Cuthbert's banner was displayed with the usual ceremonies, which, as observed before, being the royal standard of the province, must necessarily be attended by all the military men of the palati∣nate. Another circumstance in support of this opinion is, that the standards taken from the Scots in that engagement were placed as trophies round St Cuthbert's feretory. Letters were written in the name of the king, after his return from France, to all persons of note who had sought in his army at Flodden, extolling their gallant behaviour, and assuring them of his royal favour, whenever an op∣portunity should offer for their promotion.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Scotland was thrown into the utmost consusion by the fatal event, the heir to the crown being an infant of only seven months old; but as the dissentions touching the regency did not assect this province, and there was no further warfare on the borders, it is time to return to bishop Ruthall and his col∣league.</P>
<P>Wolsey returned to England with the king, in October 1513, after a new treaty was entered into with the emperor, and on the 26th of March following was con∣secrated
<PB N="392" REF="440"/>bishop of Lincoln; advancing daily in the king's favour, till at length he engrossed the sole administration of state affairs. Cardinal Bainbrigg passed the last hours of his life in great displeasure with Wolsey and the court, frequently re∣proaching the minister with want of gratitude: On his death, Wolsey was promo∣ted to the See of York. He immediately began to repair York-place, the house of the archbishops in London, and to erect a sumptuous palace at Hampton-court. Overtures of peace being made by France, Wolsey alone was entrusted with the negociation, and it is said enriched his coffers on the occasion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guthrie, vol. ii. p. 889.</NOTE>, the terms and concessions he granted being purchased by France with great gifts. Whilst he ma∣naged the whole of this treaty and other public matters with an arbitrary hand, he had such power of persuasion and artful demeanor, and had so entire a possession of the king's mind, that he made him believe every thing was done in pursuance of his royal command.</P>
<P>The king of France soon afterwards departed this life without issue, and was succeeded by the duke of Valois, who assumed the title of Francis the First. He entered Italy in a short time after his accession, and made himself master of the duchy of Milan. This event was seized on by Wolsey to enslame his sovereign's mind against him, for the French king had done him ill offices with the pope touching the bishopric of Tournay; but he made peace with the minister, by en∣gaging his interest to obtain him the vacant cardinal's hat, which was then become the chief object of his ambition. Wolsey had employed cardinal Adrian bishop of Bath, and the pope's collector in England, to solicit that honour for him at the court of Rome, but discovered he had betrayed his cause; whereupon he prevailed upon the king to write to the pope, to solicit that he might be deprived of his office, and on some pretext obtained his deputy Polydore Virgil's imprisonment in the Tower, he having been privy to some representations which were unfavourable to him. The application for the hat, in Wolsey's favour, met with great opposition; but at length the interest of the English sovereign prevailed, he was decreed the purple, and on the 7th of September 1515 was created cardinal of St Cecile be∣yond the Tiber.</P>
<P>When the cardinal was informed his hat was come into England, he ordered a messenger to be dispatched, to stay the bearer on the road till he should be better attended. He prepared a most magnificent retinue; and the bearer of this valua∣able gift was met on Blackheath by a great assembly of prelates, and men of figure and consequence from the county of Kent, who conducted him with a pompous parade through the city of London to Westminster Abbey, the lord-mayor, alder∣men, and respective companies of the city of London, attending in their stands during the procession. At Westminster Abbey, eight abbots in their proper habits received the sacred hat with great solemnity, and placed it on the high altar, where, after this pious farce, it rested till the 18th of November, being Sunday, when Wolsey repaired to the abbey, accompanied by the principal nobility and people of consequence about the court and its vicinity, and kneeling before the altar with his hood over his face, whilst the prayers and benedictions adapted to
<PB N="393" REF="441"/>the creation of a cardinal were read to him, he was invested by the archbishop of Canterbury, who, with much religious grimace, put the hat on his head. This ceremony being ended, the cardinal returned to his palace at Charing-Cross, at∣tended by a vast concourse of people, where a sumptuous entertainment was provi∣ded, at which were present the king and queen, the queen of Scotland, the queen dowager of France, the archbishop of Canterbury, the bishops of Worcester, Dur∣ham, and Rochester, the dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, Sir John Fineux lord chief justice of England, the other judges, serjeants at law, and a multitude of others of high distinction. Rapin says<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 731.</NOTE>, <Q>Wolsey so absolutely governed the king, that he “turned him which way he pleased; but he managed so artfully, that the king always fancied he took his own course, when he only followed the suggestions of his minister. Wolsey had great talents, but he had also great failings; he was excessively revengeful, greedy of possessions and honours, and intolerably proud. He no sooner saw himself fixed in his master's favour, than he sought means to remove from court all those that gave him any jealousy by the king's esteem for them: The bishop of Winchester, the dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, who had been most in favour, received so many mortifications from this imperi∣ous ”prelate, that at length they quitted the court, not to be exposed to his in∣sults.</Q> Fox withdrew to his diocese, having first besought humbly of the king, that he "would not suffer the servant to be greater than the master<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herbert.</NOTE>." The two dukes quickly followed, the duke of Suffolk being called to account for his debts to the crown<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hall, Hollingshead, &amp;c.</NOTE>. On archbishop Warham's resignation of the seals, Wolsey was appointed chancellor. He now assumed a greater degree of pomp, parade, and magnificence than any churchman in England had ever done before him: His train consisted of eight hundred servants<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Cavendish.</NOTE>, many of whom were knights and gentlemen: He had nine or ten lords among his attendants, one of whom was the earl of Derby. His equipages, furniture, and the embroidery of his liveries were uncommonly splendid and superb; even the principal cook of his kitchen, Cavendish says, was daily cloathed in sattin or velvet, and wore a golden chain. He was magnificent in his own apparel, being the first English clergyman that wore silk or gold in his habit, and on his saddles, or trappings of his horses or mules: His apparel was of scarlet or crimson sattin or taffety: He wore red gloves with his red hat: His shoes were of silver, gilt, set with pearls and precious stones; and when he ap∣peared in public, he had two crucifixes of silver, two pole-axes, two pillars of silver, gilt, and golden cushions, borne before him<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>In archbishop Sancroft's Collectanea Curiosa, (p. 283 to 344) we have a long account of cardinal Wol∣sey's plate, which appears thereby of an immense value.—I will remark a few articles only, and leave the curious reader to resort to the book for the rest.</HI>

The vulgar only were fascinated by his parade, others saw it with censure and contempt. He was condemned by all good men, who looked upon his magni∣ficence as a scandal to his religious character, and regarded the tinsel decorations of his life as the disgraceful badges of his corruptions. Bysield, who was after∣wards a martyr, exclaimed, <Q>My lord cardinal is no perfect or good man; Christ “never taught him to follow riches, nor to seek promotions; Christ never taught ”him to wear shoes of silver<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype's Mem. vol. i. p. 120, 121.</NOTE>,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the year 1516 the cardinal received a commission from the pope, appointing him legate a latere; on receipt of which he made a new parade and procession, to the disgrace of religious ceremony: He affected to perform the offices of high-mass after the manner of the pope himself, and not in the accustomed mode of other bishops; in which he was served by bishops and abbots, and the first nobility were employed to deliver him the water and towel. To support the expences of his household, besides the profits of his chancellorship, the revenues of his bishoprics, and other valuable resources, he got possession, at very low leases, of the revenues of Bath, Worcester, and Hereford, bishoprics filled by Italians, who were allowed to reside abroad, and were glad to compound for this indulgence by parting with a considerable share of their profits. He had also about this time a pension of three thousand livres granted by Charles king of Spain, having before obtained the con∣ditional grant of a pension of ten thousand ducats out of the duchy of Milan; and it was computed, that the whole of his revenues, with the pensions and numerous presents received from abroad, annually exceeded the revenues of the crown. But though he engrossed such a prodigious income from ecclesiastical and civil appoint∣ments, yet, Anthony Wood says, "he was the most disinterested clergyman of that age." In the midst of all this magnificence, the cardinal's resentments broke out into vengeance, and even the least affronts were remembered with severity, as in the case of Sir Amias Powlet, who had offended him in the early part of his life.</P>
<PB N="395" REF="443"/>
<P>In consequence of Wolsey's legatine authority, he erected an inquisitorial court, in which he exercised an undue authority and power, not known before in England, and totally unconstitutional, wherein he examined into matters under a kind of rule of conscience, as well civil as religious.</P>
<P>The cardinal now assumed the power of presenting to all priories and benefices, as he pleased, with all the usurped latitude exercised by the pope, without regard∣ing the right of patronage or election, to which the nobility or ecclesiastical bodies were entitled.</P>
<P>He accompanied the queen to Oxford, where they were received with every public mark of honour and distinction. On this occasion, he informed the univer∣sity of his design of founding public lectures on theology, civil law, physic, philo∣sophy, mathematics, the Greek language, and rhetoric, which he performed in a short time afterwards; but establishing no fund for their future maintenance, they sunk with him: He was also instrumental in establishing the college of physicians. Had not his vanity prevailed in all things, these works would have preponderated against many of his errors: He was the means of dissuading the king from enter∣ing into a league with the pope against the Turks, which he represented as a stale expecient to draw contributions from the clergy: He got the legate, who had a visitorial power, superseded and recalled; and obtained the pope's bull for visiting the monasteries and clergy.</P>
<P>On the election of a successor to the emperor Maximilian, who died in the year 1519, France and Spain, having various causes of contention and rivalship, were equally desirous of bringing over the king of England to favour their respective interests; for which purpose, they both cultivated, with the utmost assiduity, the friendship of Wolsey: Besides presents and pensions, they vied with each other who should caress him most; stiling him in their letters their friend, their patron, and their father; and extolling to the skies his virtue, prudence, and capacity. Wolsey artfully made use of those testimonies to flatter his sovereign's vanity, by representing to him how formidable he must be to those two potentates, when they thus earnestly solicited the aid and friendship of his servant; at the same time the king conceived Wolsey's abilities must be greatly superior to those of all other ministers, when they were thus acknowledged by the greatest princes in Europe.</P>
<P>On the French king's treaty for the surrender of Tournay, much incense was of∣fered to the cardinal's vanity, whose weakness in that part was known to all the neighbouring potentates; and he obtained a pension of 12,000 livres, in satisfac∣tion of the loss of his bishopric. On the above occasion, it was stipulated, that there should be an interview between the two monarchs, near Ardres, in Picardy; and Wolsey, as a man of infinite taste and magnificence in public shews and pro∣cessions, was fixed upon between the sovereigns to regulate the ceremonies, as master of the revels. Previous to Henry's departure in this interview, he receiv∣ed a visit from the new-elected emperor, the king of Spain; the cardinal was sent to compliment him on his arrival, and conducted him to the king at Canter∣bury. During the emperor's stay in England, he paid great court to Wolsey; and knowing his weakness and intolerable vanity, he engaged him in his interest,
<PB N="396" REF="444"/>by some visionary promises of procuring the papacy. The same day on which the emperor left England, the king sailed from Dover, attended by queen Catharine, the queen dowager of France, Wolsey, the archbishop of Canterbury, the dukes of Norfolk, Suffolk, and Buckingham, the marquis of Dorset, and many other noblemen and prelates, and gentry of both sexes, to the number of four thousand persons and upwards. The interview, on the 7th of June, in the valley of Ar∣dres, was uncommonly magnificent; the whole solemnity being regulated by Wolsey: On the 11th the tournaments began, scaffolds being erected for the spectators; both kings entered the lists, and exhibited great dexterity; but the honour of the field was won by the king of England: This exhibition ended, there were splendid feasts, balls, and masquerades; and such pomp and magnifi∣cence was displayed, that the place obtained the name of <HI>Le Camp de Drap d'Or,</HI> or The Field of Cloth of Gold<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Antiquarian Society have published two most elegant prints of the Embarkation and Interview, from ancient paintings in Windsor Castle, with historical descriptions of each print by John Topham, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> and Sir Joseph Aylosse, bart.—See the Archaeologia, published by the society, vol iii. p. 185, and vol. vi. p. 179.
<P>Shakespeare, in the first seene of the play of Henry VIII, introduces the duke of Norfolk giving a most pompous description of this interview to the duke of Buckingham.</P></NOTE>: The ceremony ended on the 24th of June, and Henry returned with his train to Calais. About this time the pope granted Wol∣sey a pension of 2000 ducats out of the bishopric of Placentia, and constituted him perpetual administrator of the See of Bajadox. This year an account was taken, by Wolsey's order, of the number of parishes in England, when there appeared to be 9407 churches.</P>
<P>In the year 1521, at an assembly of the prelates and clergy at the cardinal's palace, the doctrines of Luther were discussed and solemnly condemned; and the pope's bull against those religious tenets was published: By proclamation, all the books touching this condemned heresy were ordered to be brought in, under pain of excommunication. Bishop Burnet seizes this matter, to support his former ar∣guments, and prove, that Wolsey was afraid of the approaching reformation; and, to retard its progress, persecuted the sectaries: But it was assuredly other∣wise; for his state and magnificence depended so much on the approbation of the See of Rome, that he opposed whatever was in opposition to that See, not from principle, but interest. Bishop Burnet says, <Q>All people were so sensible at “this time of the corruptions, that each motion towards a reformation was readily hearkened to every where. Corruption was the common subject of complaint; and in the commission given to those whom the king sent to re∣present himself and his church, in the council of the Lateran, the reformation of the head and members is mentioned, as that which was expected from that ”council.</Q></P>
<P>This year afforded another instance of Wolsey's thirst of revenge, in the im∣peachment and death of the duke of Buckingham, who was an enemy to his un∣bounded pride and arrogance<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Godwin't Annals of Henry VIII. p. 46, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The cardinal's leading features are seen in the transactions touching the king of England's mediation between the king of France
<PB N="397" REF="445"/>and the emperor; wherein he stipulated, that the king of England and himself should be conservators of the several articles of the treaty he had propounded. Upon this part of the treaty, Rapin makes the following remark: <Q>We have here “a very sensible proof of the cardinal's insolence, who, in a treaty drawn by him∣self, presumed thus to set himself on a level with his master, by being declared ”conservator with the king.</Q>—But as to the great engagements the cardinal en∣tered into, they prove him to be without knowledge of the constitution, without any love of his country, and without truth to maintain the principles of honesty.</P>
<P>On Wolsey's return, he obtained the rich abbey of St Alban's <HI>in commendam;</HI> and also a bull to prolong his legatine authority for two years more, and to em∣power him to create fifty knights; an equal number of counts palatine, acolites, and chaplains, and forty apostolical notaries; to legitimate bastards, and grant the doctors degree in all the faculties, as well as dispensations of every class. The pope soon afterwards departed this life, and cardinal Adrian Florentius was elected; the emperor disposing of his interest against Wolsey, contrary to his engagements: This disappointment Wolsey met without any apparent chagrin, though the venom of resentment rankled secretly in his bosom. A rupture succeeding in a short time between England and France, the emperor, desirous of maintaining his footing with king Henry, on the 26th of May, 1522, visited England, and was received by the cardinal with a magnificent retinue: On Whitsunday the cardinal cele∣brated high-mass at St Paul's, with all the pomp of a sovereign pontiff; dukes and others of the nobility of the first distinction holding water to him, the king and emperor being present. On this visit, the emperor granted letters patent to Wol∣sey for a pension of 9000 crowns of gold; and, amongst other terms by which he endeavoured to conciliate and secure his future friendship, renewed his promises of interest for the papacy on the next vacancy.</P>
<P>In order to support the war which England had rushed into, the king, by the advice of his ministers, issued warrants to all sheriffs and constables, to number the people from the age of sixteen upwards, and specify the effects of individuals, that he might borrow a tenth of the laity, and a fourth of the clergy. Rapin says, <Q>“This made a great noise all over the kingdom, and every one openly exclaimed against the cardinal as the author: However, though at first he had given orders to exact loans with the same rigour as if they had been a tax imposed by parliament, he met with so many obstacles, that he was apprehensive of raising commotions in the kingdom, not to be appeased at his pleasure; so that the tax ”was levied much more gently than at first intended.</Q></P>
<P>About this period, and perhaps on the preceding occasion, the king command∣ed the bishop of Durham to deliver him a state of the kingdom in general, but particularly of those matters which more especially related to the crown: He was esteemed a person well qualified for such a calculation, had been long in office, and knew the particular revenues of the king, and the sources from whence they were derived: By such knowledge, he was enabled to make a calculation of the income and revenues of the counties at large, and the respective manors therein, with the several fees and services wherewith each was charged: and could point
<PB N="398" REF="446"/>out from whence resources in time of necessity might be derived. It is probable, the enormity of church possessions was never so manifestly demonstrated as in this work, or perhaps never before struck the eye of a sovereign with so powerful an image. The reader will no doubt wonder that our prelate so long retained his in∣fluence at court: Wolsey could bear no competitor: To be of a judicious capacity, was offence sufficient to incur his dislike, and move him to projects for his avoid∣ance. It is evident from the sequel, that the cardinal at this time entertained no good-will towards bishop Ruthall, but wished to be rid of him; for it is related, that our prelate obeyed the king's command, composed the account required in a fair hand, and bound it up in vellum. As he was thus employed at the king's in∣stance to state the condition of the revenues of the kingdom, he thought of look∣ing into the state of his own fortune, and got a second volume, bound in the same manner with the former; wherein he inserted an exact inventory of all his effects, both real and personal, not less in value than one hundred thousand pounds ster∣ling. The king sent to the bishop for the royal estimate, which his majesty was very impatient to see; but, by a fatal mistake, that containing the inventory of his own estates was delivered, instead of that composed by the king's order. Car∣dinal Wolsey instantly discovered the error, but nevertheless carried the book to the king, and told his majesty, with some sarcastical severity, that though he would not meet with the account he expected in that volume, yet he would know where to apply for money when he wanted. It does not appear the king took any advan∣tage of this discovery; but when the bishop was informed of the error, his disap∣pointment and grief overpowered him; he was seized with a mortal disease, and departed this life in London, on the 4th day of February 1522. Upon this inci∣dent the following remark occurs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr Jortin.</NOTE>: <Q>Whilst we detest the treachery of the car∣dinal, “we cannot afford much pity to the bishop with his hundred thousand pounds. If he had made a wise use of them, like archbishop Warham, who had the honour and the glory to live and ie poor, they would have been beyond ”the reach of the king and cardinal:</Q></P>
<Q><L><HI>"Extra fortunam est quicquid donatur amicis</HI></L>
<L><HI>"Quas dederis solas semper habebis opes.</HI></L></Q>
<P>"“”Even a pagan could say this."—It is evident, from the sum our prelate amas∣sed, that he had shared with the harpies of the times. The cardinal was the figuring character, the ostensible person in all public matters; whilst the old fox, with much cunning, had concealed himself under the cover of Wolsey's authority, and reaped a share of the plunder and spoils, without partaking of the odium of the world.</P>
<P>Bishop Ruthall was interred in St John's chapel, Westminster Abbey, with his effigy and this epitaph on his monument: <HI>Hic jacet Tho. Rowthall Episcopus Dunelm. et Regis Hen. VII. Secretarius, qui obiit</HI> 1524<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Wevers, Fun. Mon. 484. —Should be 1522.</NOTE>. This date is erroneous, and proves that the monument was erected some time after the prelate's death. His being seized with mortal grief at the discovery of his riches to the
<PB N="399" REF="447"/>king, whose disposition he knew, and the harpies of whose closet he was no stran∣ger to, testifies the avarice which had engrossed his mind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the auditor's office.

<P>The cardinal's possessing all the ecclesiastical dignities before noted at one time, is an unparalleled instance, an enormity that must have inspired every observer with condemnation.</P>
<PB N="402" REF="451"/>
<P>On the pope's death, our cardinal's ambition was again disappointed, Clement the Seventh being elected. He was now convinced of the emperor's insincerity, and saw, that he had been playing on his passions, but covered his resentment with a smile. In consequence of congratulations to the pope elect, he obtained, in 1524, a grant of the legatine power for life, a thing unprecedented.</P>
<P>At this time the king of England was charged with suffering his wardens and officers on the borders to aid the rebels and outlaws of Scotland, <Q>inciting them “to the contempt of their sovereign lord's authority; riding with convocations of thieves, traitors, and murderers, their accomplices, so many as they might be, and as far within the land as they durst, robbing, spoiling, and overthrowing ”the true lieges of the realm at their power<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xiii. p. 515.</NOTE></Q> The lord Dacres, warden of the west march, had entered Scotland with a plundering party, who committed great enormities, having destroyed Kelsoe, with eighty villages, and overthrown eighteen towers of stone, with all their works: Add to these, that the king of England had ordered all the Scots in his dominions to be imprisoned, and their effects seized, after which they were ordered to be branded with a cross, and sent home<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hall.</NOTE>. Not∣withstanding all these outrages, and great preparations for war being made by both nations, nothing effectual was done on either side; a treaty was set on foot for a pacification, but broke up without bringing matters to a conclusion, and the spring of the year 1523 was again busy with movements, on the part of England, to carry on a war under the conduct of the earl of Surry. The marquis of Dorset was ap∣pointed warden of the east and middle march, with Sir William Bulmer his lieu∣tenant for the east, and Sir William Eures for the middle march. The Scots laid siege to the castle of Wark, but were not able to take it; and the English army contented themselves with defending the borders, without carrying their arms into the enemy's country. Several short truces took place, and a treaty of peace for three years was at length concluded on the 10th of March 1526: In the com∣mission for this negociation, Sir William Bulmer is one.</P>
<P>In 1525 the cardinal was employed in taking measures, which, though of little note in themselves, were big with example, and led to future events of the most momentous consequence. He laid the first stone of a magnificent structure at Oxford, which he designed should bear the name of Cardinal College: In order to carry on this costly undertaking, he did not open his overburthened cossers, or withdraw any thing from his luxuries and the expence of his magnificence, but procured the dissolution of the priory of St Frideswide at Oxford, which being surrendered into the king's hands, his majesty immediately granted the same to the cardinal for the purposes of this erection, and he obtained a bull from the pope to confirm what was done. It is not said that this dissolution took place in conse∣quence of the cardinal's visitorial authority, from any vices or irregularities com∣mitted there by the members of the priory, or for any other religious cause, but appears to have been effected merely to supply this exigence. Wolsey was an ad∣venturous sinancier, but not strenuous in the cause of religion, otherwise than in maintaining the authority of the See of Rome: This example might be a political
<PB N="403" REF="452"/>trial, what effect would arise thereby, and how similar acts would be received. The king had studied divinity, and was a disputant on tenets of religion with Lu∣ther, having written a book of controversy, for the merit of which the pope and holy college granted him the distinguished title of <HI>Defender of the Faith.</HI> It seems from thence, that at the outset the king was a strenuous maintainer of the church. On various exigencies arising not only in the state, but by unbounded expences in diversions, feasting, gamings, and public shews, some extraordinary method was to be devised to raise supplies. Thus many writers have argued; and from thence deduced a supposition, that the dissolution of religious houses was the consequence; the effect of the king's vices, and not of any regard to the state, or the correction and reformation of the church. But be it as it will, the cardinal seems to have been merely an involuntary agent, directed from narrow purposes and views, to lead on the momentous event. Having succeeded in the first attempt, he now ventured to procure the dissolution of several small monasteries, situated in diffe∣rent parts of England, in order to apply the revenues to the maintenance of his new foundation. The alarm occasioned by this throughout the kingdom was great, and though reformation was the language of multitudes, though politicians of judg∣ment saw the necessity there was to check the growth of religious foundations, and the doctrines of Luther secretly gained ground with those men who gave their minds a turn to think deeply, and withdrew themselves from the luxurious enjoyments which had crept into public manners. Yet Wolsey's attack was not received with any countenance; on the contrary, the popular clamours reached the king's ear, and the tumult surrounded him whenever he appeared in public. His majesty on this occasion wrote a letter to the cardinal full of reprehension<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 67.— Rapin, &amp;c.</NOTE>; and Wolsey, to regain the king's favour, and remove any disadvantageous impressions, made him a present of his magnificent palace at Hampton-Court, and took an opportunity of acquainting him with the tenor of his will, in which he had bequeathed to him all his riches.</P>
<P>In a succeeding treaty made with France, it appears the cardinal secretly exer∣cised his resentment against the emperor, by the terms then entered into by Eng∣land. —In 1526, the king granted a power to the cardinal, to alter the value of the current coin of the kingdom; and he erected two provincial mints, one at York, and another at Durham; but of this hereafter.—In 1527, the king made several earnest applications to be divorced from queen Catharine. He was become enamoured of Anne Boleyn, one of the queen's maids of honour, who was at that time addressed by lord Percy, son to the earl of Northumberland, then in Wolsey's household, to whom she was much attached: But to serve the king's humour, Wolsey used his influence to break off the connection; and then laid the foundation in her heart, by the bitterness of disappointed love, for the hatred she entertained for the cardinal, which in the end wrought his ruin. In the sum∣mer of this year, Wolsey was appointed ambassador to France: His chief attend∣ants were, Dr Tunstall, then bishop of London; the earl of Derby; lord Sands; Dr John Taylor, master of the rolls; Sir Tho. More, and Garter king of arms; with a splendid train of knights, gentlemen, and attendants, to the number of
<PB N="404" REF="453"/>twelve hundred. Cavendish gives an account of the order of his cavalcade. When Wolsey arrived at Calais, he delivered the great seal into the custody of the master of the rolls, till his return to that city. Cavendish gives a full account of the interview and negociation, in which a treaty of amity was concluded. The third article in this treaty tended to encrease Wolsey's pride and power; the pope was then a prisoner to the prince of Orange, an ally of the emperor, and it was thereby stipulated, that the powers of England and France should never consent to the convocation of a general council during his holiness's captivity, and that they would receive no bull, brief, or mandate from him, until he regained his liber∣ty; but in the mean time every thing should be punctually executed in England, which was determined by the cardinal legate with the concurrence of the clergy. It is said, Wolsey made attempts to get his legatine power extended to France and Germany, but did not succeed. On the above embassy, he received great presents both from the king of France and his mother, arrived in England on the 30th of September, and was graciously received by the king, who ordered a public thanks∣giving for the success of his negociation. Collier says, <Q>And here the lord Her∣bert “observes, the king's fancy began, of being head of the church and clergy; and that the first impressions of this kind were received from the cardinal; of whom, likewise, this noble historian reports, the king took the hint for the dis∣solution ”of monasteries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 23.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>In the year 1528, on the death of Fox bishop of Winchester, the cardinal was translated to that See, and resigned the bishopric of Durham.</P>
<P>No public edisice within this palatinate was erected by the cardinal, save some reparations made to the south end of Tyne-Bridge.

<PB N="405" REF="454"/>Wolsey's time, and that Frankeleyn, then temporal chancellor, who had been re∣ceiver for bishop Ruthall, understanding the gainful privileges of the bishop,
<PB N="406" REF="455"/>urged their due exercise. This letter shews, that the collieries of Whyckham were then leased out by the bishop, for a rent proportionable to the quantity won,
<PB N="407" REF="456"/>so that it must have arose by measure: Also that the merchants of Newcastle had obstructed the navigation of Tyne, and hindered the shipping of coals from the keys of Gateshead, by which means they monopolised that commodity, buying the coals at their own price, and selling them to the public at an enormous advance. It also appears, that Hartlepool was not then in the power of the bishop, for he re∣commends it to the cardinal to recover that haven by writ of restitution, and forti∣fy the same, as being then the best haven town in England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ab. a<SUP>o</SUP> 1523.

</LIST></NOTE> The cardinal bishop
<PB N="408" REF="457"/>in the year 1526 issued his commissions, with the king's instructions annexed, for arraying ships in the ports of the county palatine, to attend and serve under the king's admiral in the north seas.</P>
<P>In the 14th and 15th years of Henry VIII, (1522 and 1523) an act of parlia∣ment was made touching the coinage, intitled, <Q>An act what coiners shall do that “”make money at any mint within England;</Q> whereby it was provided, that no∣thing therein contained should affect the coiners of York, Duresme, or Canterbury.
<PB N="409" REF="458"/>As to our prelate's mintage in this province, Mr Noble says, <Q>As primate of “York and bishop of Durham, his mints supplied great part of the north of the kingdom with money, the coin being now numerous. He coined groats and half-groats at York, but only pennies at Durham, and they must be classed in ”two divisions, those struck before, and those after the 18th year of his reign.</Q> He gives three specimens of Wolsey's coin minted at Durham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See place of coinage letters N. N. N. N<SUP>o</SUP> 1, 2, 3.</NOTE> <Q>N<SUP>o</SUP> 1. The “epigraphe upon the obverse is, HENRIC. DI GRA. REX ANGL.; between the words there are small crosses, as the obverses of his money generally have; upon the reverse the legend reads, CIVITAS DVRRAM; and the letters D. W. upon the sides of the shield, above the bars of the cross, must be read Dunelmen∣sis Wolsey<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">As he and his predecessor were of the same Christian name, he might not chuse to put the initial of his first name upon his money of Durham, except there was also that of W. for Wolsey; this is a pretty strong proof that those with the letters T. D. upon them have been properly placed to Ruthall.</NOTE>.—N<SUP>o</SUP> 2. is the reverse of a penny of his; it reads CIVITAS <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>R∣RAM, and has also the initials D. W. but has not the cardinal's hat: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th this and N<SUP>o</SUP> 1. have a star for the mint-mark, the former on both sides; from which circumstance, it is probable this penny was also coined before the 18th
<PB N="410" REF="459"/>year of this reign. In the year 1527, when the second coinage of this reign took place, the king gave the cardinal a commission respecting the equalling his coins to those of the neighbouring mints, or the royal money in general. This no doubt respected his mints both at York and Durham; and probably enjoined him to copy the type of the new money, to prevent frauds, by having more than one kind of money in the kingdom.—N<SUP>o</SUP> 3. is a penny after the type of the king's second coinage; the epigraphe on the obverse is, H.

<P>The future public transactions of the cardinal being in no-wise pertinent to our provincial history, we must quit the subject of his life at this period, and wind up with his general character.</P>
<P>He is described to be in person tall, comely, and very graceful in his carriage and air: It is said one eye was blemished by a certain disease, which occasioned his pictures to be always taken in profile; but this seems to be a low, scandalous, and puerile conjecture, and without support. He was a man of quick parts, a clear and ready perception, and of great industry; but every good quality was oversha∣dowed by the poison of ambition, and the arrogance of pride. He advanced him∣self, by an exertion of extraordinary abilities and a prostitution of every principle, to serve his king and aggrandise his own fortune. He governed England for the space of twenty years, during which time he knew all the cabals of foreign courts, and had spies on every prince in Europe, by which he rendered himself truly formidable, having in his hands the exercise of all his sovereign's power, so that he was courted, flattered, bribed, and caressed, by the greatest potentates in Christen∣dom. He rendered England formidable to all the powers of Europe during his administration, by his intrepidity, his absolute power, and determinate will. Yet his negociations were not conducted by political principles or patriotic virtue, but arbitrary maxims, and felfish, lucrative views. Mr Hume says, <Q>If in foreign “politics he sometimes employed his influence over the king, for his private pur∣poses, rather than his master's interest, which he boasted he had solely at heart, we must remember, that he had in view the papal throne, a dignity which had he obtained, would have enabled him to make Henry a suitable return for all ”his favours.</Q> The latter part of Henry's reign has been held up in comparison with the former, wherein Wolsey presided, and the errors of one in competition with the other, given in argument for his administration: But this is a visionary justification; for the enormities of the latter part of the king's life were perhaps born of the feeds which Wolsey had sown, and the principles he did not live to see matured in life. Lord Herbert says, <Q>It may be doubted, whether the impressions “he gave, did not occasion the irregularities which were observed to follow."— ”He had ever taken care,</Q> says one of our historians, <Q>to conceal from Henry
<PB N="411" REF="460"/>“that there was ought above royal will and pleasure, or that law had the force to ”curb prerogative.</Q> Wolsey shewed, in a variety of instances, that he was bit∣terly vindictive, insatiably rapacious, and insolently arbitrary. On many of the most important occasions, he displayed his contempt of the laws, and utter disregard to the constitution of his country, when they lay in competition with his own power, interest, or ambition. He was charged with great immoralities and a lasci∣vious life; and yet, in public, he kept up much shew of solemnity, piety in re∣ligious offices, and the exterior forms of religion; had an eloquent and persuasive tongue, and possessed a superior share of learning and true taste; he promoted and gave great support to literature, and was the general patron of learned <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n. Charged with incontinency, his natural children are pointed out, two of who<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he had by one woman, as appears by the articles of his impeachment. Thomas W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ter, who was generally received as his son, had a learned and liberal education, being sent to study at Paris; and he held many eminent preferments through Wolsey's interest.</P>
<P>Cavendish, in the close of his work, says, <Q>Here is the end and fall of pride “and arrogancy of men, exalted by fortune to dignity. For I assure you, that in his time he was the haughtiest man in all his proceedings alive; having more re∣spect to the honour of his person than he had to his spiritual profession, wherein ”should be shewed all meekness, humility, and charity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wood Athen.

<P>The cardinal died at Leicester, 29th Nov. 1530, and was privately interred in the chapel of the abbey there.

<P>After the translation of cardinal Wolsey, the See of Durham remained vacant almost a whole year; during which period, the issues of the palatinate were given to Anne Boleyn. In December, 1529, CUTHBERT TUNSTALL<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">For the elegant portrait of this bishop I am indebted to Marmaduke Tunstall, of Wy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lisse, in the county of York, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> who had it engraven, from an original painting in his possession, on purpose for this work.</NOTE>, then bishop of London, was translated to this See; and on the 25th of March, 1530, received restitution of the temporalties.</P>

In a pedi∣gree of the Holland family<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Blomesield's Norfolk, p. 232.</NOTE>, he is said to be the son of Sir Richard Tunstall, knight of the garter, and to have been brought up some years in Sir Thomas Holland's kitchen, till being known, he was sent home to his father. It is proba∣ble such assertions are erroneous. Bayle says of him, that he was born of an il∣lustrious house<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Splendido loco natus Bayle Script. Brit. p. 713.</NOTE>. In the pedigree of the Tunstall family, revised and corrected by the late learned Dr Burton, of York, he is set down as a son of Thomas Tun∣stall <ABBR>esq</ABBR> brother of Sir Richard Tunstall, knight of the garter; and on his death, without issue male, in 1492, his heir and successor in Thurland Tunstall, Lanca∣shire, the seat of the Tunstall's for many ages, and which, by grant from Henry IV. they had a power to fortify as a castle; the family being always staunch friends to the house of Lancaster. This latter opinion seems corroborated by the bishop's will, proved before Walter Haddon, doctor of laws, 13th Jan. 1559-80; where he calls Sir Francis Tunstall, then of Thurland, great grandson of this Thomas, his nephew.

So, giving Packington all the copies that lay in his hands, the bishop paid for them, and brought them over and burnt them in Cheapside. Next year, when the new edition was finished, many more were brought over; and chancellor More enquiring of one Constantine who it was that encoura∣ged and supported them at Antwerp, was told, that the greatest encouragement they had was from the bi∣shop of London, who had bought up half the old impression.

<P>After Wolsey's death, the king urged the matter of his divorce with redoubled earnestness, having obtained opinions and decrees in his favour from most of the eminent seats of learning in Europe. Our prelate wrote on the side of the king. Various accounts appear touching this matter: Bishop Burnet says, <Q>The king “having commanded the archbishop of Canterbury to require the opinions of the bishops of England, they all in writing under their hands and seals declared it an unlawful marriage; only the bishop of Rochester refused to set his hand to it." J. Pitt's account is very different: "There was only one blot in bishop Tunstall's life; his being seduced and drawn in by the king to assert, that his marriage with Catharine of Spain might and ought to be dissolved, and to write a book wherein he endeavours to prove it: Of which he so much repented afterwards, that he went into the quite contrary opinion, condemned the book he had written, constantly took the queen's part, and was one of the advocates ”in her cause.</Q> This is explained by the following paragraph in bishop Fisher's life: <Q>Cardinal Campeius called for doctor Cuthbert Tunstall, bishop of Lon∣don, “and desired to hear him speak; for he was a man of profound judgment and learning, and one in whose wisdom and honesty the cardinal reposed great confidence. This Tunstall had written a very learned treatise in defence of the queen's marriage, which indeed should have been read in the court; but the
<PB N="414" REF="463"/>king, fearing his abilities, purposely sent him upon an embassy into Scotland, at the very time he should have appeared, about a trivial business; so that he ap∣peared ”not in court this second time.</Q> The king, dreading to meet the opposi∣tion of the See of Rome, was determined to shake that authority to the root: He was of a temper resolute and obstinate; so that he rested not till he had accom∣plished whatever he proposed. In the 21st year of his reign<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Statutes, Cha. 23.</NOTE> he gave the first great blow to the pope's supremacy in England, by a law<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">There is another clause in this act "which forbids all spiritual persons having or occupying by himself or any other to his use, any parsonage or vicarage in farm, of the lease or grant of any person or persons, or to take any profit or rent out of such farm, upon pain to forfeit 40 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> for every week, and to lose ten times the value of such profit or rent, as he shall take out of any such farm.

Bishop Tunstall for a time solemnly protested against making the recognition, on account of the following words in the preamble to grant a subsidy to the king, in a convocation for the province of York; <Q>Quam plurimos hostes, et maxime Lutheranos, in perniciem ecclesiae “et cleri Anglicani (<HI>cujus singularem protectorum unicum et supremum dominum, et quantum per Christi legem licet, etiam supremum caput ipsius majestatem recognosci∣mus</HI>)” conspirantes, &amp;c.</Q> He was willing to allow, that the king, after Christ, was the supreme head of this kingdom, and of the clergy of England in earthly and temporal matters; but would not acknowledge him to be such both in spirituals and temporals, or that it was lawful according to the law of Christ: Yet afterwards, bishop Tunstall not only acquiesced therein, but also recommend∣ed

<P>And where now of late I have also received the king's most honourable letters sent unto me by Sir Francis By got knt. containing the king's highnes com'andment for setting forth of his title of Supreme Head of the Church of England, and the abolishment of the authority of the bishop of Rome; I not only myself, before the receit of the same letters, had done my duty in setting forth his title of supreme head, but also caused others to do the same. And so his grace was prayd for ever since the proclamation of the act thereupon made. And e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sones upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eceit of the king's said letter, I repaired to Duresme, and there preached myself again in great presence, as well in setting forth the king's title, as in declaring the usurped authority of the bishop of Rome, heretofore used in this realm. And so have done, and shall from time to time accomplish the king's commandment in my diocess, God willing.

Surely I look for no mutation, nor new world, but one; which is the changing of this life transitory to the life eternal in the world to come. Which mutation, whensoever it shall happen, I beseech Almighty Jesus, of his infinite mercy, that I may leave the king's highness in his most prosperous reign many years after my decease, to myche increase of his honour, the wealth of his subjects, and the propogation of his most royal posterity.

<P>The king having established this great point, had no longer any dread of papal interposition, to controvert his purpose in the divorce, and interfere with his government of ecclesiastical matters; and therefore granted a general pardon, in ample form, to all the clergy.</P>
<P>Whilst these affairs were agitated with much warmth, the state of the borders was turbulent, and mutual inroads were made. Lesley says, the king perceiving the jeopardy of the northern parts of his dominions, by such constant irruptions of the Scots, the English border being thinly inhabited, proposed to his parliament, that a pole-tax should be imposed, to enable government to raise bulwarks, or a chain of fortresses, to resist those incursions; but the measure was opposed. It ap∣pears that the Scots surprised the castle of Norham; but it was soon retaken by Frankeleyne, then archdeacon of Durham, and who had been temporal chancellor there in cardinal Wolfey's time, and during the vacancy of the See after his trans∣lation: For this service, he had an armorial coat granted<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">F. Bibl. Harlei. N<SUP>o</SUP> 1499. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. In the following year, Coldingham was reduced to ashes, and other barbarous acts of warfare were committed by both nations; a stop to which was fortunately put, by a truce for a year, that took place on the 19th of June, 1533, and was succeeded by a peace, agreed to be maintained during the lives of the reigning sovereigns.</P>
<P>In the year 1532, an act of parliament passed for extinguishing the payments of annates or first-fruits of bishoprics to the See of Rome, which had drained from England, since the second year of Henry VII.'s reign, no less a sum than 160,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and a provision was made, touching the consecration of prelates, by the authority of the king. On the 23d of May, 1533, sentence was given for the king's divorce; and on the 28th, by another sentence, the king's marriage with Anne Boleyne was confirmed, and she was crowned queen on the 1st of June.
<PB N="416" REF="465"/>This event added new force to Henry's desire of shaking off the power of Rome; as the queen, resenting the pope's non-compliance, ceased not to irritate and urge his passions on that pursuit; and when the pope, through the instigation of the emperor, published a sentence against the king, it brought to a crisis that desired business, and England was for ever severed from the See of Rome; for the whole legislative body was so displeased with the pontiff's conduct, that with one mind they determined utterly to abolish the papal authority in England. A statute was made, whereby it was enacted, <Q>That, for the future, the pope shall have nothing “to do in the nominating or presenting of bishops; but that when a bishopric shall become vacant, the king shall send to the chapter a <HI>Congè d' Elire;</HI> and in case the election shall not be over in twelve days after the licence issues, the election shall belong to the king. That the bishop elect shall swear fealty to the king, and then be recommended by him to the archbishop to be consecrated. That if the bishop or archbishop refuse to obey the contents of this act, they shall be liable to the penalty of <HI>Proemunire.</HI> Moreover, all persons were ex∣pressly ”forbid to apply to the bishop of Rome for bulls, palls, &amp;c.</Q> It is observable, that bishop Tunstall was not present at the passing of this law; and Fisher bishop of Rochester, and Sir Thomas More, refusing to sign the act, were sent to the Tower, and afterwards suffered death. The people in general rejoiced, and those favouring the reformation flattered themselves the new principles of re∣ligion would gain a rapid progress: But the propitious aera was not yet arrived, a multitude of obstructions arising; for the king, to clear himself from the impu∣tation of turning protestant, which was bruited with much rancour, exercised great rigour against the Lutherans, and brought multitudes of the sacramentarians to the stake: The monks, notwithstanding those sacrifices, were imprudent enough to exclaim publicly against the legislative measures, which hastened the more tardy steps of their destruction, by exciting the king's indignation.</P>
<P>After the succession act was passed, our prelate was one of the king's messengers to queen Catharine, then at Bryden. They attempted to persuade her to relin∣quish her title, and submit to the sentence; but all their learned arguments could not prevail against her obstinate virtue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 175.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The parliament which met on the third of November, 1534, confirmed the king's title of <HI>Supreme Head of the Church of England.</HI> By another act, the bene∣fit of sanctuary was taken away from persons accused of treason: And by a third, annates and first-fruits were given to the king, together with tenths of all ecclesi∣astical benefices. In 1535, our bishop was one of the commissioners for taking the valuation of ecclesiastical benefices, in order to settle the first-fruits and tenths under the before-mentioned act. By another statute, provision was made for suffragan bishops, which revived an institution of the primitive church, that had been discontinued for several centuries.</P>
<P>The necessity there was of the king's maintaining his measures against the See of Rome, combating with his aversion for the name of heresy, he having in his heart entertained no idea of reformed principles in religion, like a storm, tossed
<PB N="417" REF="466"/>him in different directions: His steps were rigorous; he persecuted the Lutherans with unremitting severity, at the instant he was pursuing his projects to overcome by force the obstinacy of such of his subjects as refused to submit to the laws late∣ly enacted; in consequence of which, the bishop of Rochester and Sir Thomas More suffered death on the scaffold, and several other ecclesiastics were brought to execution. As Henry had conducted himself for some time with great haughti∣ness, <Q>he found, if he relaxed on this occasion, it would certainly be ascribed “either to his scruples or to a sense of his weakness, than which nothing could be more prejudicial to him; this consideration, joined to his stern and haughty temper, rendered him altogether untractable: From thenceforward he became fierce, cruel, insensible of his people's calamities, and executing without mercy the laws dictated by himself to his parliament. All that can be alledged in his vindication is, that he was often provoked by persons, who, endeavouring to alienate the hearts of his subjects, attacked him in the most sensible part, be∣cause ”his whole reliance was upon the assistance of his people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rapin.</NOTE>.</Q> The monks, by every secret influence and artifice, endeavoured to incense the minds of men against the king; they still held many in the bondage of superstition and religious horror, and practised on such subjects to stir up sedition. To prevent the mis∣chief which evidently threatened, Henry resolved to try how his subjects in gene∣ral would be affected under the idea of a dissolution of the monasteries; and for that purpose made a movement in a lower degree: The <HI>observant friars</HI> had been most clamorous against the measures of state, and he made them the first objects of his wrath; he suppressed their fraternities, and filled their houses with Augus∣tines<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>9.</NOTE>. It is astonishing with what resignation the king's purposes were submitted to; various reasons have been assigned by learned writers; and it is the most ge∣neral opinion, that the morals of the religious at that period greatly contributed to influence the acquiescence of the people; one party dreading resistance, as de∣structive to their establishment; the other watching for favourable circumstances to advance their designs. The fate of the <HI>observant friars</HI> occasioning no ad∣ditional clamour, and being determined effectually to sap the power of Rome in his dominions, Henry saw no way to accomplish it, but by stripping the religious houses of their influence and authority. He had proved, that there was no cer∣tain means of dividing the monks from the papal authority, and thence he was led to pursue the destruction of the monasteries with every degree of severity and attention. An act of parliament was passed, to empower the king to visit, order, and reform all errors and abuses in religion; under which he did not doubt to remove the people's ancient prejudices and affections for the monks, by a public discovery of their errors and enormities, and thereby pave the way to his great de∣sign. He had views beyond the renunciation of the authority of Rome, the profits he should derive from a confiscation of monastic possessions, by which he might support the approaching war threatened by the emperor, without imposing any tax on his subjects: The benefit and advancement of religion was the most distant sentiment of his heart. To traverse the progress of this great business
<PB N="418" REF="467"/>through all its stages would lead us beyond our limits. We shall have occa∣sion to descend to some particulars, when the history of the cathedral church of Durham, and some of the inferior monasteries are treated of. Therefore, it must suffice in this place to say, that an act of parliament passed (27 Hen. VIII. c. 28.) for the dissolution of all those abbies which did not possess above the clear yearly income of 200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> whereby 376 religious societies were dissolved, and a yearly re∣venue of 30,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> accrued to the exchequer, besides the plate, jewels, and per∣sonal effects belonging to their houses, which was computed at 100,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> Col∣lier says, <Q>The seeing the monks and nuns stroll about the country for their “bread, and the churches pulled down, profaned, and turned to barns and ”pigeon-houses, was no agreeable spectacle.</Q> On this dissolution arose <HI>The Court of Augmentations.</HI></P>
<P>The county of Durham was greatly affected by the above act, though the cathedral church stood undissolved. It will appear remarkable to the reader, that the vices and enormities charged on the lesser monasteries were not to be discover∣ed in the large: But there was a grand finesse in this<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>r.</NOTE>; for the act tells us, "Those were regular, and answered the purposes of their institution." Perhaps the lesser houses could not be suppressed without the consent of the greater, and of those there were no less than twenty-six mitred barons, who sat in the house of lords: It was prudent, therefore, to lay the apprehensions of those abbots asleep, and prevent their suspicion of salling under the same fate.</P>
<P>There happened a suspension of the affairs of the monasteries in the king's mind for some time, his heart being occupied by two discordant passions, under which he was grievously agitated; the one, his jealousy of queen Anne; the other, a violent love for Jane Seymour, one of the maids of honour: The first brought on the un∣timely fate of the queen, and the latter elevated the favourite to the throne. To render this flagrant act more atrocious, the king got his marriage with queen Anne annulled, and a sentence of divorce was pronounced on the surmise of a previous contract, by which the princess Elizabeth was declared illegitimate. By an act made in the succeeding parliament, the divorce was confirmed, and the issue of both the king's marriages disabled from inheriting the crown: But power was vested in his majesty to declare the succession by letters patent, or his will. Rapin says, <Q>“Had the sentence of divorce been passed before the trial, she could not have been condemned for adultery, since her marriage with the king must have been consi∣dered only as a concubinage: But Henry had acquired such an absolute sway over his subjects, that his will was the sole measure of justice and law; nay, he so little regarded the public and his own reputation, that he married Jane Sey∣mour ”the day after Anne Boleyn's death.</Q> And, speaking of the above act of parliament, he adds, <Q>This is a clear evidence, that the parliament had not justice “”and equity so much in view, as pleasing the king.</Q></P>
<P>In the year 1356, the king caused to be exhibited, Articles of Alterations in re∣ligious Doctrines, and orders to examine them, and make report thereof to his majesty. The reformists on this appeared in high spirits, and openly separated
<PB N="419" REF="468"/>themselves from those who were adherents to the established church; of the latter, it is said, were bishop Tunstall, and Lee archbishop of York<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide articles at length, Collier, vol. ii. p. 122.</NOTE>: Yet in the copy of articles in the Cotton library, both those bishops are subscribers thereto. To this instrument there are the hands of eighteen bishops, forty abbots and priors; and, of the lower house of convocation, four deans of cathedrals, twenty-five archdea∣cons, three deans of collegiate churches, seventeen proctors, and one master of a college. Bishop Tunstall being a subscriber, shews his great moderation in religi∣ous matters, though he stands in the list of those who opposed the reformation. In consequence of the articles, Cromwell, privy seal, issued injunctions to the clergy grounded thereon: The fourth declares, <Q>That they should not lay out their rhe∣toric “in slourishing upon images, relics, or miracles, upon any motion of super∣stition, or covetousness; that they ought not to persuade their people to pilgri∣mages, contrary to the intendment of the late articles, but rather exhort them ”to serve God, and make provision for their families:</Q> And the seventh pro∣vides, <Q>That every church should have a bible in Latin and English, to be laid in “”the choir, for every one to read at their pleasure.</Q></P>
<P>The king, to appease the minds of the people, who now appeared to declaim against his measures, re-founded some religious houses, on stricter rules; but that not prevailing, an insurrection was sormed in the north, headed by several of the dispossessed clergy, who assembled under the title of <HI>The pilgrimage of grace,</HI> carry∣ing several religious ensigns, with crucifixes, and other holy things, usually exhi∣bited in processions. The people of Richmondshire, Lancashire, Westmoreland, Cumberland, and Durham, fired the beacons, a signal for all men capable of bear∣ing arms to assemble, and put themselves in a posture of defence, which gave a great alarm to government. The earl of Shrewsbury was ordered to march im∣mediately with a body of troops, to quell the insurgents. As the rebels moved forward, they reinstated the monks in the possession of their monasteries, and the monks in return used every effort to enslame the minds of the populace, with that enthusiastic rage superstition and bigotry inspire. To intimidate such monks as were thus repossessing themselves of their old seats, under the influence of the in∣surgents, the king ordered an example of terror to be exhibited, by dragging out the religious from several monasteries thus seized, and executing them by martial law: Among those houses, where this tragedy was exhibited, we sind Norton and Hexham are named. The rebels advanced as far as Doncaster, in the month of October, where they were met and amused, by the duke of Norfolk, with the pro∣posals of a treaty, and petition to the king for redress of grievances, projected merely to give time for the royal army to advance, which Henry proposed to lead in person. Sir Ralph Elerker and Robert Bowes presented the potition to the king, to which he sent an answer in certain articles penned by himself, and granted a pardon to all, except six persons therein named, and four unnamed. The nor∣thern clergy met at Pontefract, and agreed to certain articles of religion, to be pro∣posed at the treaty: The archbishop of York was present at this assembly, when he told the people, that be their grievances what they might, the manner of their ap∣pearance
<PB N="420" REF="469"/>was unwarrantable, and an armed pilgrimage was totally unlawful. After this meeting, a day was appointed to treat with the duke of Norfolk, and other the king's commissioners. At the head of the insurgents, we find John lord Scroop, the lord Latimer, John lord Lumley, Thomas lord Darcy, Sir Thomas Percy, Sir Ro∣bert Constable, Sir John Bulmer, Sir Stephen Hamilton, Sir Thomas Hilton, Rich∣ard Tempest, and William Lumley, with many other distinguished persons of this country. The demand of the malcontents was extravagant, inconsistent, and inad∣missible; one of which was, <Q>That the liberties of the church should have old “customs, as the county palatine of Durham, Beverley, Ripon, St Peter of York, ”and such other, by act of parliament.</Q> The king told the people, in answer to their petition, "that they were brutes, and inexpert folks." It is observable, that this sentence, with some other parts, were interlined by the prince himself<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Speed's Hist. Great Britain.</NOTE>. To amuse the populace, a general pardon was granted, which had the desired effect of disuniting the insurgents, who returned in small parties to their respective coun∣ties. The duke of Norfolk still kept his troops together, and at their head, exact∣ed oaths of submission from the country as he passed: But the popular dissatisfac∣tion did not subside; the disappointed monks still retained an influence over the consciences of the vulgar, and some small parties took the field again, though they were soon dispersed, and the lord Darcy, Sir Robert Constable, Sir John Bulmer, Sir Thomas Percy, Sir Stephen Hamilton, Nicholas Tempest, and William Lumley, in consequence of this latter offence, were apprehended for high treason, and car∣ried up to London, where lord Darcy was beheaded; several ecclesiastics and others were also executed at Hull, York, and elsewhere in the north, among whom were six abbots, the prior of Bridlington, five Lincolnshire priests, and several monks. The duke of Norfolk discharged his commission with great rigour, and dispatched no small numbers by martial law. The king being at length moved to close the tragedy and stop the issue of blood, granted another general pardon.</P>
<P>It is evident, from the names of the active persons in the rebellion, that this province had a great share therein; and the consequence was, that material change which immediately took place here, when the honours and ancient authorities of the palatinate were taken away; when this bishopric was deprived of those powers wise and pious princes had placed here, not only for the honour of the province, but also from the most prudential political principles and maxims of state. The regal diadem of Deira was never torn from hence till this aera. The franchises and <HI>jura regalia</HI> were retained, after the dissolution of the heptarchial states, and union of the provinces; but the ruthless tyrant, with the hand of destruction and arbitrary will, came forth, and swept away in vengeance all the ancient glory of this imperial mitre, and levelled its greatest honours with the earth. How our prelate was affected in mind by this stroke, is not said; he had been disciplined into passive obedience, and probably looked upon the solemn ruin with a silent sigh. An act of parliament was passed in the 27th year of this reign; by the first clause of which, the bishop was deprived of the privilege of pardoning any of the offenders in the late tumults, by being restrained from granting any future pardons
<PB N="421" REF="470"/>within his palatinate to principals or accessaries in treasons, murders, manslaugh∣ters, felonies, or any outlawries for such offences; by the second clause, the an∣cient authority of appointing and commissioning justices was taken from the bi∣shop; by the third, all writs were directed to run in the name of the king, the bishop having only the right of testing the process in his name; by the fourth, the ancient tenor of indictments was taken away, and the offence was thereafter directed to be stiled <HI>against the peace of the king,</HI> and no longer <HI>against the peace of the bishop,</HI> as was the usual form; by the fifth, the king was to take all manner of fines, issues, amerciaments, and forfeitures of stewards, bailiffs, or other ministers or officers of franchises or liberties, for non-execution, mis-execution, or insufficient returns of such writs, warrants, precepts, or other process, which to them or any of them, or to any their deputy or deputies should be directed, or for any con∣tempt or other misdemeanor, whatsoever it be, concerning their offices, in and for the due execution or administration of justice, any grant, or allowance, or other thing to the contrary thereof notwithstanding; and that the amerciaments for in∣sufficient returns of writs, or other process made by stewards or bailiffs of liberties or franchises, having returns of writs and execution of the same, should be put and set upon the heads of such stwards or bailiffs, and not upon the sheriffs: The ninth, tenth, and eleventh, relate to the purveyors of the king's court; the four∣teenth and fifteenth enact, that all sheriffs and their officers within such liberties should be subject to the general laws relative to the duty of their office; the fix-teenth and seventeenth give authority to justices within their liberties, and declare, that persons within such liberties shall not be compelled to appear before any jus∣tice out of the same liberties; the twenty-first provides, that the bishops of Dur∣ham and their temporal chancellors shall be justices of the peace within the county palatine, with as full powers as any other justices of the realm.</P>
<P>Thus were the bishops of this See stripped of their greatest palatine honours. The possessions within the palatinate were not affected, but the chief regalities were removed. The reader will best distinguish what diminution of privilege took place, by the prelate's future exercise of power, expressed in the various records hereafter referred to.</P>
<P>An act also passed about this time, whereby tithes, and other ecclesiastical pro∣fits arising during the vacancy of any spiritual promotion, were directed to belong to the person next presented, towards the payment of first-fruits.</P>
<P>A controversy had arisen between cardinal Pole and the king: Pole was of the blood royal, and cousin-german to his majesty by both the houses of York and Lancaster; under the king's auspices he had received a very liberal education, but from real principle dissented from the king's opinion, and wrote freely there∣on: Bishop Tunstall, on account of his learning and judgment, was appointed to answer the cardinal's arguments, and some letters passed between them,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Biog. Brit. 3981.</NOTE> one of which, from this prelate to the bishop of London, touching the supremacy of the bishop of Rome<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">One of the letters that passed between them is printed in bishop Burnet's History of the Reformation, part iii. collect. N<SUP>o</SUP> 52. Another in Strype's Eccl. Memorials, vol. i. p. 296; and Appendix, N<SUP>o</SUP> 83, p. 206. And another in J. Fox's Acts and Monuments, vol. ii. Bacon's Reports, fol. 272; and the Appendix to Dr Knight's Life of Erasmus, p. 66, &amp;c.
<P>In one of the letters, the bishop proceeds, and puts Pole in mind, <Q>That the popes, at their coming to “the chair, make a solemn profession to observe the canons of the eight general councils. That by the regulations in these councils, there is no such monarchy settled on the See of Rome as is now pretended. The ancient fathers knew nothing of the right of governing the universal church, to which the modern ”popes have put up their claim.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Custom and ancient usage are insisted on" Tunstall replied, "That for the first thousand years, the belief and practice of the church was against him. That in the primitive times, when the blood of the martyrs was fresh, and the scriptures best understood; when faith was strongest, and virtue had its greatest ascendant; when things were in this state of advantage, the customs of the church must be better than those of latter ages; of latter ages, I say, when ambition and covetousness had made an impression on Chridendom. And whoever shall infer the papal authority now exercised, especially in temporal mat∣ters, ”from St Peter's primacy, may, by parity of reasoning, make light and darkness the same thing.</Q> In proof of this point, the bishop refers the cardinal to cardinal Cusanus, in his second book <HI>De Concordia Catholica.</HI> <Q>'Tis safest to govern ourselves by the decisions of the earlier ages. Now it is evident from “the councils, that no particular See has so extensive and monarchial a privilege; and that the preferences given to the bishop of Rome in those general councils, were granted <HI>upon the some of the imperial city and the See being the capital of the empire: It was s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> this reason that the pope had the precedence, and not because St Peter and St Paid exercised the apostolical function, and were buried in that city. In short, this prerogative was not dra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n from any claim in the gospel, but granted in honour to the capital, and in conformity to the ci∣vil ”government.</HI></Q></P></NOTE>, is mentioned as particularly severe.</P>
<PB N="422" REF="471"/>
<P>The king having suppressed all insurrections, was no longer under apprehension of mischief from the influence of the clergy, and thenceforth determined to pur∣sue his scheme of a general dissolution of religious houses. In the year 1537, vi∣sitors were sent out with new instructions, of a more rigid nature; and were, among various other matters, to enquire concerning the loyalty and private beha∣viour of the monks, to inspect into their superstitions, ceremonies, and tenets, and to discover how they were affected towards the king's supremacy. Bishop God∣wyn remarks, on the king's care to expose the superstitious errors which had crept into the church, "That he was strongly disposed to promote any reformation that turned the penny and furnished his exchequer." He directed Becket's bones to be burnt, defaced his monument, and ordered his name to be erased from the calendar; but withal seized the wast treasures which had been offered at his shrine.</P>

<P>In the year 1540, most of the larger monasteries were surrendered to the king; the priory of Durham was surrendered by Hugh Whitehead, then prior, on the last day of December, in the 31st year of this reign. An act was passed to vest all the religious houses, with their lands, rights, and possessions, in the crown; by force of which, the king, on the 12th of May, 1541, founded the cathedral church, and appointed a dean and twelve prebendaries therein for ever; dedica∣ting the church to the glory of Christ and the honour of the blessed virgin, by the name of <HI>The Cathedral Church of Christ and blessed Mary the Virgin;</HI> ordaining, that it should be the cathedral church and episcopal seat of the reverend father in Christ, Cuthbert, then bishop, and his successors, bishops of Durham for ever. The king, by this foundation charter, appointed the surrendering prior the first dean, and twelve of the most eminent of the fraternity prebendaries, whom he incorporated by the appellation of <HI>The Dean and Chapter of the Cathedral Chruch of Christ and blessed Mary the Virgin,</HI> and granted them a common seal, with power to the dean, for the time being, to appoint inferior officers and ministers of the church. By letters patent, dated the 16th day of May, 1541, the king en∣dowed the church with all its former possessions, having previously dissolved the inferior monasteries or cells which were dependant thereon: We find the manor and cell of Finchale, with the church and all things appertaining thereto, and the cell of Holy Island, specified.</P>
<P>There is something irreconcileably inconsistent in the king's religious complex∣ion; with one hand, at this time, he was enforcing the <HI>bloody statute,</HI> as it was cal∣led, compulsory as to the belief of six articles, which he intended should take away all imputation of his having quitted the original and rigid tenets of his religion;
<PB N="424" REF="473"/>and with the other he was holding out, by proclamation, the free use of the holy scriptures, and countenancing relaxations totally incompatible with the arbitrary rules of that statute. How our prelate relished this conduct relative to the scrip∣tures, after having bought up and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 413.</NOTE> burnt Tyndal's translation, we are not told. Perhaps he was afterwards convinced of the utility of such liberality, or otherwise, from his universal temperance and excellence of mind, we may conclude, that what he did not actually approve, he refrained from strengthening by a vain resistance; for he must have observed, that opposition in matters of religion only served to blow up the flames of enthusiasm; and we find that, in 1541, a new edition of the Eng∣lish bible came out, revised by him and Heath bishop of Rochester. It is alledged, by an author of credit<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Strype, Appendix, p. 257.</NOTE>, that it was our bishop's fixed opinion, old usages were not to be dispensed with, without weighty reasons; and that some of them were in no wife to be broken.</P>
<P>Except that six bishoprics were founded out of the latter dissolutions, few such appropriations as at Durham were made; the lands in general were profusely given to favourites and flatterers, the money lavished in gaming, trivial amusements, and follies, and the state so far from being relieved, lay as open and subject as ever to taxes on every emergency.</P>
<P>The king, become apprehensive of troubles from the continent, and suspicious of the faith of Scotland, caused the fortresses on the coast, and those on the northern frontiers, to be repaired. Bishop Tunstall was at considerable expence in restoring the castle and bulwarks at Norham; soon after which, hostilities were commenced on the borders, and Sir Robert Bowes, then governor of Norham, at the head of 3000 horsemen, made an inroad, practising the accustomed depredations and cruel∣ties; but he was taken prisoner, with his brother Richard, Sir William Mowbray, and several other persons of note. Henry was determined to bring the states of Scotland to terms, and also anxiously hoped to revenge the affront the Scottish king had lately put upon him, by making him wait at York on a proposed interview, without appearing or sending an excuse. He assembled a great army at York, the command of which he gave to the duke of Norfolk, who entered Scotland in Oc∣tober 1542, laid waste the country in his march, and reduced Kelso and its beau∣tiful abbey to ashes. Nothing more material was effected by the English army. The Scottish leaders refused to pass the borders at their sovereign's command, after which the disgraceful dissention prevailing in the army under Sinclair, which brought on their defeat by a handful of English cavalry, led by Dacre and Mus∣grave, gave the king of Scotland, who was subject to a depression of spirits, such distress of mind, as to bring him with a broken heart to the grave, leaving a daugh∣ter (Mary) the heiress to the crown, an infant not above a week old.</P>
<P>The queen had born king Henry a son, who was named Edward, and soon after departed this life. On the 6th of January 1540 the king married Ann of Cleves, against whom, at first sight, he entertained the strongest aversion: He submitted to the match merely from political principles, and in disgust refused to consummate his marriage. Cromwell, who had been created earl of Essex, and negociated this
<PB N="425" REF="474"/>marriage, provoked the king's displeasure, was accused of treason, and suffered death. Thus fell an able statesman, one who had imbibed all the political maxims of cardinal Wolsey, and lived to bring to maturity the projects his royal master had adopted, from the cardinal's devices, for extricating England from papal authority, and dissolving the religious houses. A divorce was obtained to relieve the king from his marriage, and innumerable instances of the abject servility and depravity of parliament followed. On the 8th of August, Henry declared his marriage with Catharine Howard, the most unhappy of his matrimonial engagements. On her accusation, the parliament not only found her guilty of the crimes imputed to her, but petitioned the king for her execution, together with her accomplices.</P>
<P>The dissolution of colleges and hospitals was now devised, and the previous steps thereto entered upon; but the measures were not at that time fully carried into ex∣ecution.</P>

<P>In July 1543, Henry married his sixth wife, Catharine Parr; and in the parlia∣ment which met on the 14th of January 1544, an act was passed to establish the order of succession to the crown, in which prince Edward and his heirs stood first; the king's issue by queen Catharine Parr, second; the princess Mary, third; and princess Elizabeth, fourth. The king entertained a project of uniting the two kingdoms, by a marriage contract between his son Edward and Mary princess of Scotland, which was opposed by cardinal Beaton, the Wolsey of Scotland, and consequently much trouble ensued on the borders. A treaty of peace and marriage alliance was entered into in the year 1543, but by the cardinal's intrigues and in∣fluence, it was annulled by the states of Scotland; and in the following year the English army made an inroad, with the ordinary consequences of depredation, pillage, and destruction. Eure and Laton, two of the northern leaders, fell in this expedition; and it was not until the year 1546 that peace was concluded, which event was followed by the death of Beaton<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Portraits belonging to the duke of Hamilton, in Holyrood-House: "A head of cardinal Beaton, black hair, smooth face, a red callot.

<P>In November (37th of Henry VIII.) 1545, all colleges, free chapels, chantries, hospitals, fraternities, guilds, and the maintenance for stipendiary priests, with all their manors and other estates, were sacrificed to the crown, and dissolved. Thus the foundations made for the benefit of learning and relief of the poor, which were strengthened with the privilege of corporations, and intended for perpetuity, lost the stability of their settlements, and lay at the mercy of the king.</P>

<P>Henry expired in the night of the 28th of January 1546-7, in the fifty-sixth year of his age, having reigned near thirty-eight years. During this reign the stake smoaked with executions, whilst the fluctuating and uncertain principles of the king's mind, in religious matters, displayed in contradictory expositions, rendered it very uncertain whether those victims suffered from mistaken principles of policy, or the workings of superstition and bigotry. The block was equally fatal, and some victims were sacrificed in a manner as shocking as ever stained the hands of tyranny. The breach of matrimonial faith, after a series of twenty years in the most consummate conjugal felicity, was punished amply in this life by infidelity and the tortures of a jealous mind, by the fatality which snatched from him the enjoy∣ment of increasing affection, and by the sorrows of embittered aversion. But as the most momentous events in the hand of Providence are frequently brought about by involuntary agents, and consequential good proceeds from momentary evil, so there was not the least spark of patriotic principle in Henry's heart, conducing to abolish the authority of the See of Rome, or one breath of virtue to inspire the wish of extinguishing that supremacy, which for so many ages had impoverished the state, and weakened the hands of government. To gratify his vices, to indulge his passions, and to maintain a determinate will, he pursued his project, redeemed his crown from a vassalage of the most inglorious nature, and his kingdom from grievous oppression. The dissolution of religious houses proceeded from maxims equally unconnected with principle; he neither took the trouble to consider what effect the existence of those foundations had on the state, nor what benefit posterity and their liberties would reap from their fall: The momentary idea of gain was all he cherished, and the maintenance of his authority the only maxim, which urged him more than lucre. When we see his arguments on religious tenets, we are astonished at his erudition, his perspicuity, and specious piety; but his life demonstrates these were only visions of the mind, which never reached his conduct. In no aera, of this or any other country, do we discover so many good effects derived from such bad purposes.</P>
<P>Henry's only son succeeded to the throne, at the age of nine years, by the title of Edward the Sixth. In the list of regents appointed by the late king, we see our prelate's name: At the beginning of Edward's reign, he was one of the privy council, and of the king's council in the north. The first effect we observe of the new government was an abatement of the rigour of the six articles, and a visitation ordained, under which the advancing reformation gained new vigour, the commis∣sioners being armed with certain articles of injunction, for the tenor of which the reader is referred to Fox, Fuller, Heylin, Sparrow, and Collier; only observing, that Bonner bishop of London, and Gardiner bishop of Winchester, refused to comply therewith.</P>
<P>The Scots now appearing turbulent, and unwilling to maintain the articles of peace, induced the English regency to march an army northward. An engagement happened near Musselborough on the 10th of September, in which the Scots had a disgraceful rout, losing a number of men almost equal to their adversary's whole force. Various movements were made by the victorious army to harass the ene∣my;
<PB N="427" REF="476"/>and, on their return towards Berwick, Roxburgh was made tenable, and the command thereof, with a garrison of three hundred men, given to Sir Ralph Bul∣mer. Whilst the army lay in this neighbourhood, the protector knighted near fifty in the field, among whom was Sir Ralph Vane, then lieutenant of horse<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Patten.</NOTE></P>
<P>On the fourth of December the parliament sat, and our prelate was dismissed the council board. Collier says, <Q>The reason of this removal, it is probable, was to “weaken the character, and make the opposition of Tunstall in the progress of re∣formation ”less significant in the house of lords.</Q> This parliament gave to the king all the lands of chantries, chapels, and colleges, unpossessed by his father: Bishop Tunstall was one that voted against this act. In the year 1548 the council made several regulations in church offices, and forbade the carrying of candles on Candlemas-day, ashes and palms on the respective Sundays, and the rites used on Good-Friday and Easter-day.

<P>Government was not only harassed with an expensive prosecution of the Scottish war, but various insurrections appeared in the kingdom, fomented by discontented men, who had but momentarily acquiesced in, and not submitted to, the rules of state touching the reformation: But the commotions were all quelled in the same year they were formed; and, fortunately, a peace was concluded with Scotland, under some of the articles of treaty with France, in the year 1550.</P>
<P>Bishop Tunstall in all points paid obedience to the law, and to all the injunctions that were made by the authority of the legislature; but on every occasion in par∣liament, as bishop Burnet says<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 194.</NOTE>, was against the changes in religion, which he thought he might with a good conscience submit to, though he could not consent to them. <Q><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Biographia Britannica.</NOTE> At length some of the courtiers, coveting the revenues of his rich “bishopric, took the advantage of an accusation of misprision of treason brought against him, for which he was committed to the Tower, on the 20th of December 1551." In the minutes of the council-book, the transaction stands thus noted: 20th May 1551, the bishop of Durham is commanded to keep his house.—Au∣gust 2d, he had licence to walk in the fields.—December 20th, Whereas the bishop of Durham, about July 1550, was charged by Ninian Menvill to have consented to a conspiracy in the north, for the making a rebellion. And whereas for want of a letter written by the said bishop to the said Menvill, whereupon great trial of this matter depended, the final determination of the matter could not be proceeded unto, and the bishop only commanded to keep his house; the same letter hath of late been found in a casket of the duke of Somerset's, after his last apprehension. The said bishop was sent for, and this
<PB N="428" REF="477"/>day appeared before the council, and was charged with the letter, which he could not deny, but to be his own hand-writing; and having little to say for himself, he was sent to the Tower, there to abide till he should be delivered by process of law." Collier says<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 324.</NOTE>, "he offered to purge himself, but in what manner, or upon what arguments, the record does not mention; it is only said, his answer was deemed insufficient." "The parliament<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Biog Brit. p 1982.</NOTE> sitting on the 28th of March, a bill was brought into the house of lords to attaint him of misprision of treason. Archbishop Cranmer spoke warmly and freely against it, not satis∣fied, it seems, with the charge which was laid; however, the bill passed, being greatly hurried through the house of lords, and read on March 28th, 29th, and 31st, the archbishop protested; but when it came down to the commons, they were not satisfied with the evidence, which consisted of bare depositions of wit∣nesses, but required that the accusers might be brought face to face; and so it went no further. When he could not be ruined in a parliamentary way, means were contrived to do it in a more private and effectual manner; for that pur∣pose a commission was granted, 21st of September 1552, to seven persons, em∣powering them to call before them Cuthbert bishop of Durham, and examine him of all manner of conspiracies, &amp;c. and, if he were found guilty, to deprive him of his bishopric. Accordingly he was deprived, either on the 11th or 14th of October, and remained a prisoner in the Tower all the rest of Edward's reign. Upon his deprivation, the bishopric was offered to Dr Robert Horne, dean of the same church, who refused to accept it; next to Nicholas Ridley, bi∣shop of London." Collier on this occasion says<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 335.</NOTE>, "As for Ridley, he was ac∣tually translated from London to Durham; for in the instrument by which Bon∣ner was restored to the See of London, in the next reign, it is set forth, that the bishopric of London was then void by the translation of Ridley to Durham, upon the deprivation of Tunstall by Edward VI. And thus Bonner was re-invested without pronouncing Ridley deprived of the See of London. But on the con∣trary, it appears by the register, that Ridley was deprived of the bishopric of ”London for heresy and sedition<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Harmar, p. 120.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>To proceed with the account in the Biographia Britannica: <Q>Then a project was formed of dividing the bishopric into two, by founding a new one at New∣castle; but that design did not take effect, nor very probably was it ever in∣tended it should: For though that is mentioned in a private act of parliament, in March, 1552-3; yet, in April, 1553, being converted into a county pala∣tine, ”it was given to the ambitious John Dudley, duke of Northumberland.</Q> Sir John Harrington says, <Q>This See was once dissolved by act of parliament in “the minority of Edward VI. what time the two new dukes of Somerset and Northumberland, like the soldiers that cast lots for Christ's garment, divided between them <HI>patrimonium crucifixi,</HI> namely, the two good bishoprics of Bath and Durham, one being designed as a seat for the western duke, the other for the northern; and whereas, by an old metamorphosis, the bishop of Dur∣ham had been earl of Northumberland, now, by a new apotheosis, the duke of

The bishopric being suppressed, the king founded two others; one at Durham, with 2000 marks revenue; and another at Newcastle, with 1000 marks revenue: But the temporalty of the bishopric being turned into a county palatine, was given to the duke of Northumberland; and probably Tunstall was deprived, and the See suppressed, for that very purpose<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 25.</NOTE>. There are palpable errors in these accounts. In the first place, there are no records in the Durham archives, to prove that Ridley was ever appointed to the See of Durham; much less ”that he had installation, and restitution of the temporalties.</Q> The preamble of the act for suppressing the bishopric of Durham sets forth, <Q>That the See being “then void, the disposal of it was in the king; that the extent of it was too large, and reached to so many distant shires, that it could not be well governed by one bishop; and since the king, out of his godly disposition, was desirous to have God's holy word preached in these parts, which, for lack of good preaching and learning, were grown wild and barbarous: His majesty there∣fore intended to have two bishoprics for that diocese; one at Durham, which should be endowed with 2000 marks annual rent; and another at Newcastle, which should have 1000 marks revenue: And also to found a cathedral church at Newcastle, with a deanry and chapter, out of the lands of the bishopric. The bishopric therefore of Durham is utterly extinguished and dissolved, and authority is given for letters patent, to erect the new bishoprics, together with a deanry and chapter at Newcastle; with a proviso, that the deanry, chapter, and cathedral of Durham should suffer nothing by this act<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Burnet, part 2d, p. 215.</NOTE>." Collier observes<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 334.</NOTE>, These new erections were mentioned, in all likelihood, for a colour, to smooth the way for the dissolution bill, and cover the duke of Northumberland's de∣signs. Had there been a different design at the bottom, the new erections would have been pursued, and the act taken its effect; this had been no more than a just deference to the legislature: But this provision was in a great mea∣sure overlooked, and the mask pulled off in a short time; for in May follow∣ing, the temporalties of the bishopric were secularised, turned wholly to a county palatine, and granted to the duke of Northumberland. That the duke had a prospect and a promise too of the temporalties of this See, is very likely;
<PB N="430" REF="479"/>”but that the grant was executed in form of law, is more than appears.</Q> The death of the king, it is most probable, put a stop to the design<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The duke, after this act, or perhaps after Tunstall's deprivation in the preceding October, had taken possestion of Durham house; for there the marriage of the fourth son, lord Guildford Dudley, with lady Jane Gray, together with the marriage of Lady Jane's two sisters, and of Northumberland's daughter, were celebrated on the 21st of May. The duke was made steward of all the honours, castles, lordships, and lands, in the counties of Northumberland, Westmorland, and York, or any other where in the bishopric of Durham, for life. This grant is dated April 1553.—Strype, vol. iii. p. 422, 507. He also had a gift of the town of Alnwick in Dec. 1551.—Strype, p. 499.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Another act passed the same year<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1553, 7 Edw. VI. cap. 10.</NOTE>, whereby the town of Gateshead was annex∣ed to Newcastle, and severed from the bishopric of Durham; the inhabitants thereof to continue their common in the bishopric of Durham, and wood in Gateshead park for the reparations, and that the liberties of the bishop of Dur∣ham should continue.</P>
<P>The Duke of Northumberland had such prevalence over the mind of the young king in the disturbed moments of his sickness, that it is said he could obtain of him what he pleased. From the blindness and folly of his ambition, he got cer∣tain instruments signed by the king, to settle the succession of the crown on his daughter-in-law, the lady Jane Gray; the obvious operation of which unconstitu∣tional act, to every reasonable mind, after his majesty's death, was to bring all the parties to the scaffold; and so it terminated; the most amiable female being involved in the ruin her father's pride was deservedly rewarded with.</P>
<P>The young king was seized with a defluxion in his lungs, under which he lan∣guished to the 6th of July, when he expired. He displayed a great vivacity and quickness of genius, had acquired much school learning, and spoke several lan∣guages: He was a prince of good hopes, of a virtuous mind, and generous prin∣ciples, which occasioned his death to be much lamented.</P>
<P>After nine days dignity, the lady Jane was divested of regalities; and Mary, the eldest daughter of Henry VIII. ascended the throne, and was proclaimed queen on the 19th of July, 1553.

And further, it was by th'auctority of the saide parliament enacted, that all and singuler the saide honors, castells, mannors, landes, tenements, and other the premisses, should be adjudged and demed in the reall and actuall possession of our saide laite sova∣raigne lorde the kinge, without any office or other inquisition therein to be had and taken, as in and by the saide act of parliament amongest other things plainly doth and maye appere.</P>
<P>And where also in the saide parliament, by one other act of parliament, it was ordeyned and established by authority of the same, that the towne of Gatishede, and all the inhabitants of the said towne that then were, or hereafter should be, and a parcell of grounde called the Salt Meadowes joyninge to the said towne of Gatishede, and harde upon the river there, and the whole water and bridge belonginge or apperteyninge to the saide towne of Gateside, then being parcell of the possessions of the saide bushopricke, and also of the liberties and countye palantyne of Durham aforesaid, should be from thenceforthe severed and devyded from the said bushoprike, and from the liberties and countye palantyne of the same, and from thencesorthe should be united and annexed unto the towne of Newcastle upon Tyne, and to be taken, demed, and judged to be within the countye and shire of the saide towne of Newcastle upon Tyne, and to be reputed and taken as parte parcell and member of the said towne of Newcastle; and that the inhabitants of the saide towne of Gateside should be under the rule, government, and correction of the major and burgesses of the saide towne of Newcastle, as other inhabitants of the saide towne of Newcastle then were, or of right ought to be, as in and by the saide other act amongst other thinges more at large doth and may appere.</P>
<P>The which several acts and statutes were compassed and brought to passe in the tender yet es and minoritye of our said lait soveraigne lorde the kinge, by the sinister labour, great malice, and corrupt meanes of cer∣tain ambitious personnes then being in aucthoritye, rather for to enriche themselves and their frends with a great parte of the possessions of the said bushopricke, then upon just occasion or godly zeale: And although the saide deprivation of the saide reverend father from the saide bushopricke, proceeded only upon untrue surmises and false accusations of suche as were partly entised and provoked thereunto, by the synister and corrupt laburs of the saide ambitious personnes, as it hath sithen upon deliberate and mature examinations of the cause of the saide deprivation, before divers of the quene's highness commissioners, by force of hir highness commission, manifestly and plainly appeared: Whereupon the saide sentence of de∣privation pronounced against the saide bushop, is clearly repealed, reversed, and made frustraite, to all in∣tentes and purposes, as by a certaine instrument authenticke more at large doth appeare.</P>
<P>And albeit also, it hath pleased the quene's most excellent majestie, of hir most godly zeale and vertuous disposytion, to erect and establishe againe by her most gratious letters patent, the saide bushopricke of Dur∣ham, and hath endowed also the same with all suche honors, manors, landes, tenements, and hereditaments, as were in hir highness handes and possession, by force of the saide two several acts; and hath by the saide letters patent, given and disposed the said bushopricke and the said possessions unto the saide reverend father in God Cuthbert now bushop of Durham and to his successors: Yet the saide reverend father in God Cuthbert now bushop of Durham, notwithstanding the repeale of the said sentence of deprivation, cannot by vertew thereof, nor by force of the saide letters patent, have, possess, and enjoye to him and his successors, all and singuler honors, manors, landes, tenements, privileges, royalties, liberties, franchises, and other hereditaments, the whiche did belonge unto the saide bushopricke before the makeinge of the said two seve∣rall acts, in as large and ample manner, as he did, or ought or should have done, if the saide two severall estatuts had not bene maid, for that the saide two severall estatuts remayne yet in there perfect estate and effect.</P>
<P>In consideration of all whiche premisses, be it therefore enacted, ordeyned, and established, by the queene our soveraigne ladie, by th' assent of the lordes spirituall and temporall, and the commons in this present parliament assembled, and either of them, that all and everie branches, articles, sentences, clauses, and matters in the saide several estatutes or acts of parliament, and in either of them conteyned, shall be from henceforth adnihilated, repealed, and utterly voide and of none effect, to all intents constructions and pur∣poses, as well against our saide soveraigne lady the quene her heires and successors, as against all other per∣sonne and personnes, bodies politique and corporat, and everie of them, as though the saide several estatuts or acts of parliament or either of them had never bene had or made, any thinge or things in the same actes or either of 'em conteyned to the contrary thereof in any wise notwithstandinge.</P>

<P>An act was also passed, on the 2d of April 1554, to enable the queen to make statutes for collegiate churches; which act sets forth, that Henry VIII. being em∣powered to make statutes and ordinances, did deliver, by his commissioners, certain ordinances to the several churches, in writing; but not being indented, as requi∣red by the statute, were void or avoidable; and such power being only vested in the king, his heirs and successors could not make ordinances wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hout the authority of parliament.

<PB N="437" REF="486"/>This act was as much confined to the queen as the other was to the king, so that any statutes afterwards made without authority of parliament, are of no validity.

Brit. p. 3982.</NOTE></Q> But this is not a true state of the fact; for the deprivation was not on account of their be∣ing married, but for breaking the solemn monastic vow of single life: The words of the commission being, <HI>Post expressam professionem castitatis expressè, ritè &amp; legiti∣mè emissam, cum quibusdam mulieribus nuptias de facto, cum de jure non deberent con∣traxisse.</HI></P>
<P>In this year an act passed, by which the pope's authority was restored to the same state as before the 20th year of Henry VIII.'s reign, with some restrictive articles, by which bishoprics, cathedrals, and colleges, were protected as they then were. The legate cardinal Pole, then in England, ratified the articles, with a denunciation of the judgment of God, on all the laymen who possessed church lands.</P>
<P>Whilst the persecutions of Mary's reign struck the nation with a panic, the bor∣ders were in a turbulent state: Civil polity was much neglected, and the plunder∣ing parties of each nation were constantly making depredations on the neighbour∣ing country. Commissioners were appointed by the queen to hear and redress the border grievances; of those, bishop Tunstall was one, at a congress at Dunse in 1556, and again at another congress at Carlisle in 1557, with the earl of Westmor∣land, Robert Hanmer chancellor of Durham, and others; but matters not being adjusted, the war with France embroiling the two nations, open hostilities com∣menced in the month of August, and were not stayed during this reign; for on the 17th day of November 1558, the queen died, in the 43d year of her age, having reigned little more than five years. She was a bigot, and displayed much stubborn resentment, malice, and cruelty in her disposition: She discovered no political ca∣pacity in her government; and, as a woman, had no character at all. Cardinal Pole, who figured in this reign, by his benevolent mind and gentleness of temper, exhibits a contrast, which casts upon some of the cotemporary prelates the aspect of monsters and furies. If it had been possible for bishop Burnet to have produced one instance in support of his assertion, that the queen had a generous disposition of mind, he would have uttered it; the most partial eye in her favour cannot dis∣cover it in history. Our prelate, as observed before, was of gentle and tolerant principles, and is rescued from the supposition of being a party in the cruelties and severities of Mary's reign, by his being seen, in several historical instances, in the commission for treating with the Scots, and in proof<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his residence in his bi∣shopric during those miserable times, which were marked with the deepest trage∣dies. His diocese escaped persecution, and was not stained with the blood of one religious victim.</P>

<P>The accession of Elizabeth was a profound shock to those who were most violent in persecution. She was crowned on the 14th of January 1558, by the bishop of Carlisle, with the usual ceremonies and oaths. Her first care was to repeal the several laws made in the reign of Mary touching matters of religion, and to revive those of Henry VIII. and Edward VI. Soon after an act was passed, by which the bishops were barred from making any grants of their manors or farms for more than twenty-one years, or three lives, except to the crown. By another act, made in the first year of this reign, cap. 19, <Q>Giving authority to the queen's majesty, “upon the avoidance of any bishopric, to take into her hands certain of the tem∣poral ”possessions thereof,</Q> this See suffered a great diminution in revenue; for by bishop Pilkington's address to secretary Cecil, set forth in the course of this work, it appears the queen seized upon Norham and the shire, of the yearly value of 120 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> Easington ward 323 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 13 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> Easington Coronator 72 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> Sadberge 23 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> os. 11 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> Cotom Mundevil 47 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 16 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 1 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> Middleham 19 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 11 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> Gates∣head 24 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 11 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 7 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> Creik 39 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 7 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> Allerton and the shire 218 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 9 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 1 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> ¼, a pension out of Howden 91 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 5 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> ½, which were not restored till the year 1565. The act for establishing the English common form of prayer, was succeeded by a tender of the oath of supremacy to the bishops and clergy, which was refused by all the prelates except the bishop of Landaff: The consequence of such refusal, among other instances, was the deprivation of bishop Tunstall. Collier says<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 431.</NOTE>, <Q>“As to the bishops, they had most of them sworn the <HI>regale</HI> in the reign of Hen∣ry VIII, not to mention their compliance under the reign of Edward VI.; but since they had now made their submission to the See of Rome, and gone all the religious lengths of Mary's reign, they were resolved to make a stand, and ad∣here to their last change: And in regard they threw up their preferments, and ventured the penalties of the act, it is most likely they went off upon motives of ”conscience.</Q> The account given of our prelate in the Biographia Britannica<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">p. 3983</NOTE>, is, <Q>When queen Elizabeth came to the crown, there were great hopes that a man “of his great meekness and knowledge would have readily come into the reform∣ation; but being attached to some errors, and indeed so far advanced in years that he had in all probability a very little time to live, he conscientiously chose rather to lose his rich bishopric than act against his own judgment.

<P><Q>“This prelate had seen as great a variety of fortune as most men; he had lived in difficult and in easy times; he had known both protestants and papists in power, and yet, from all parties<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Erasmus.—Sir Tho. Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</NOTE> and in all revolutions of government, he had found favour. The truth is, he was well versed in the arts of temporizing, and possessed a large share of that complying philosophy, which, taking offence at no∣thing, can adapt itself to all things. When Harry the Eighth began to innovate, the bishop of Durham had no scruples; when his son went further, still the bi∣shop was quiet, and owed indeed his confinement at the close of that reign to his desire of continuing so. Again, when queen Mary reversed what they had done, with this too the bishop was satisfied, and forgot all his former professions. Thus much, however, may justly be said of him, that upon all occasions, and where no secular ends were in view, he shewed himself a man of great modera∣tion;
<PB N="440" REF="489"/>and whether in his heart he was more papist or protestant, to arbitrary proceedings, however, in either persuasion, he was wholly averse. Thus he thought things were carried too far on one side in king Edward's time, and too far on the other in queen Mary's; with both reigns he was therefore dissatisfied, though he was too great a lover of his own ease to oppose them. But as his days shortened, his ambition decreased, his conscience grew more tender, and what he had done for Harry and Edward, he refused to do again for Elizabeth. Though the bishop of Salisbury is of opinion, he was not with-held by any scru∣ples, but such as a sense of decency raised, from complying with that princess: He was very old, and thought it looked better to undergo the same fate with his brethren, than to be still changing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet.</NOTE>; and this is the rather probable, because many historians say, the late reign had given him a great disgust to popery, and that he would often own to archbishop Parker he began to think every day more favourably of the reformers. In private life his manners were highly commen∣dable: He had an absolute command over himself; a temper which no accident could discompose, great humanity, and great good-nature. In learning, few of his cotemporaries were equal to him; none more ready to patronise it. Of the offices of friendship he was a strict observer; and was not only a favourer, but a zealous encourager of good men. In a word, where he was not immediately under the influence of court maxims, he gave the example of a true Christian ”bishop<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gilpin's Life of Bern Gilpin, p. 118.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>In 1558, the fortifications of Berwick were ordered to be strengthened, and ad∣ditional forces were raised, to oppose a descent the French had projected making near Newcastle: Of those new levies, the bishopric of Durham was required to raise five hundred men<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Orders were sent to the bishop of Durham to send men from the bishopric, in case of necessity. The queen determined to send forthwith to the borders 1000 men; and for that purpose, as she had addrest her letters to the bishop of Durham (7th Jan.) to put the forces of the bishopric in such readiness as they might, upon any sudden warning, be ready to serve under Sir George Conyers; so four days after, by another let∣ter, he was enjoined to levy in the bishopric 500 sootmen, and that he should confer with Sir J. Croft con∣cerning sit gentlemen to have the leading of them, and to have special foresight that none of the officers used any frauds for the sparing of any man from this service.—Strype's Ann. p. 19.</NOTE>. A treaty shortly after made with France, included Scot∣land, so that hostilities ceased, and a peace was concluded with that state on the last day of May, 1559, in the church of St Mary of Upsetlington, and duplicates were delivered the same day in Norham church. Bishop Tunstall was a commissioner in this negociation, with Thomas lord Percy earl of Northumberland, William lord Dacre of Graystock, and Sir James Crofts governor of Berwick.</P>
<P>Bishop Tunstall was an accomplished, learned, and excellent prelate, and author of many valuable works; highly beloved, admired, and praised by all his learn∣ed cotemporaries both at home and abroad; among whom were the great Eras∣mus, Sir Thomas More, dean Collet, Lynacre, &amp;c. and by many illustrious per∣sons of every persuasion since, who have all been lavish in their encomiums on him: Besides what has been already quoted from Erasmus, he speaks of him in many other places, as, <Q>This man is of the most blameless life, eminently “versed in both the old and new literature, and well acquainted with every

Edit. of 1615, 4to. p. 669.</NOTE>." William de Cham∣brè, quoted by Wharton in his account of the bishops of Durham, speaks thus of bishop Tunstall: "He had always a creditable family, and was honourably attended by people of all conditions; for where ever he resided, he kept a mag∣nificent table, he was very charitable, and an illustrious prelate in every re∣spect<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">Familiam honorificam semper secum tenuit, honorificeque attendebatur a generosis et hominibus pl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣beiis, quecumque enim loco residebat honorificam mensam valdeque largam semper secum ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t, in elem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣synis erat abundans, in omni vitae genere praeful praeclarus.—W. de Chambre.—Wharton's Ang.

Camden, speaking of the eminent bishops of Durham, mentions Cuthbert Tunstall, who died about the beginning of the last age; and for learning and piety, was, without envy be it spoken, equal to them all, and ”a very great ornament of Britain<NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">Cuthbertus Tunstallus summarum artium scientia (absit invidia verbo) illorum omnium instar, of M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣nae Britanniae ornamentum.—Camd. edit. of 1587, p. 50<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.—Bp.

<PB N="442" REF="491"/>Good-Friday, a bushel of silver pennies among the poor, probably of his own coining, the See of Durham still enjoying that privilege. He was a great bene∣factor to his See; and, besides what he bequeathed to it by his will, made several additional buildings both at Durham and Auckland, whereon his arms are to be seen in many parts. Bishop Godwin says, <Q>He built from the ground a most “beautiful porch or gate-house<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A gallery leading to the chapel.</NOTE>, with a chapel annexed thereunto, in the castle of Durham, and added to the said castle certain gates, with iron bars and port∣cullises, supported with strong walls on each side: He brought water thither with a conduit; whereas before-time it was served with well water: He built the gate-house at Alnwick<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bp.

<P>Mr Noble gives three specimens of the coin of this prelate: <Q>N<SUP>o</SUP> 1. a penny, “differs scarcely in any one circumstance from those of Wolsey's second coinage,
<PB N="444" REF="493"/>upon the obverse; the reverse has this legend, CIVITAS DVRRAM; upon the sides of the shield, above the bar, are C. D. for <HI>Cuthbertus Dunelmensis.</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 2. is also a penny of this prelate; the chair is the only difference, upon the obverse, from N<SUP>o</SUP> 1. the arms of which are broader, and the ornaments at the top of them are seemingly meant for mitres; the reverse reads, CIVITAS DVRHAM; the first initial is blundered, being an E, as they were then made, set the contrary way; this, however, is evidently only a mistake of the engraver for a C; and as the other letter is a D, they must be read Cuth. Dunelmensis. N<SUP>o</SUP> 3. has the same legends as N<SUP>o</SUP> 1. but it has not the least appearance, in other respects, of an episcopal coin; the arms of the chair are plain, and the re∣verse is without any initials; it has the star for the mint-mark, as N<SUP>o</SUP> 1. and 2. and which most, if not all of bishop Tunstall's have: This coin was probably struck, just before Henry deprived this See, and the two metropolitical ones, of the privilege of a mint; and to avoid that jealousy which the king discovered at these charters, it might be judged prudent to omit every episcopal and local distinction that could give offence. There is no notice (in the act of Hen. VIII.) taken of the mints, either of Durham, or those of the primates: However, there is not a doubt but that their abolition was understood by the preface to it. It was not then, perhaps, thought necessary to be very exact in wording it; few subjects being hardy enough to dispute the will of so powerful and tyrannic ”a prince as Henry VIII.</Q></P>

<P>During this prelate's time, not only the cause of religion, but also political matters, called the queen's attention towards Scotland; and the borders were fre∣quently the scene of military operations. The queen paid great attention to Ber∣wick, which she justly observed was the key of the kingdom; she caused it to be strengthened in the mode of fortification practised since the use of ordnance, and formed a military establishment there. The earl of Bedford in 1565 was governor of Berwick, warden of the eastern march, and lieutenant-general of the forces: It is added, he was lord-lieutenant of the counties of Northumberland, Cumber∣land, Westmorland, and the bishopric of Durham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype's Memor. Eliz. vol. i. p. 443.</NOTE>. The lord-lieutenancy of this county doth not appear to have been exercised by any of our bishops, after the re∣formation; nor did they from thenceforth appear in any military capacity: In se∣veral instances, the crown nominated a lord-lieutenant.</P>
<P>In August, more effectually to secure Berwick, the queen directed the earl of Shrewsbury, who had the lieutenancy of Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, and Derby∣shire, to levy 2000 men, 1600 in Yorkshire, and 400 in the bishopric: On this, the earl of Bedford conferred with the high-sheriff of the county palatine, and other considerable persons there; by whom he was told, that there was no in∣stance of the bishopric being charged with the sending forth of any men; their proper business being to aid Berwick and the unpeopled frontiers, when pressed by any actual necessity<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Strype's An. vol. i. p. 399.</NOTE>. No open rupture took place for some time; and in affairs of state touching Scotland, we do not see our prelate employed in any public ca∣pacity, or this palatinate materially affected: So that, in the military movements, no circumstance is particularly pertinent to this work, until the insurrection of the northern earls. The subject of their discontent and rebellion is too notorious to require repetition; the duke of Norfolk's conduct, in the proposed marriage with Mary queen of Scots, is largely treated of by all our historians: Charles Neville earl of Westmorland, and Thomas Percy earl of Northumberland, were yet attached to the religion of their ancestors, and shewed public testimonies of dislike to the reformed principles; they were abettors of Norfolk's project, in hopes to restore
<PB N="449" REF="499"/>the ancient church. The queen received repeated intimations of their disaffection, and their correspondence with Mary's partizans; she summoned them to court to answer for their conduct, but they disobeyed the mandate. The earl of Westmor∣land was possessed of a large territory in the bishopric of Durham, the honour of Barnardcastle, the lordships of Raby and Brancepeth, and many other inferior possessions: These were populous districts, where multitudes of dependents were under their command. In contempt of the queen's summons, the earls openly declared their defiance, rang the bells backwards to alarm the country, and with all expedition collected and arrayed their military men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LG>

<PB N="450" REF="500"/>“upon the people, and bring them to a revolt, they threw out several spe∣cious pretences; some were made to believe the forces were levied to guard the queen; others were told, all the English quality had engaged to restore the old mode of religion; and to others they pleaded a necessity of appearing in arms, to rescue the ancient nobility from the insults of upstarts, and to secure the country from being betrayed to foreign interest. One Nicholas Norton was a great incendiary in this commotion. He is said to have been sent from the pope for this purpose, and had instructions to declare the queen an heretic, ”and that she had forfeited her dominions for her disbelief.</Q> The earl of Nor∣thumberland lay at Topcliff, at his house there, before he openly took up arms; and being informed in the night of the 14th of November, that a scheme was laid for seizing his person, he rose hastily from his bed, and withdrew to the earl of Westmorland, then at Brancepeth, where their dependents came in to them. On marshalling their army, they published a manifesto, in which they set forth, <Q>“That they had taken the field, only to restore the religion of their ancestors, to remove evil counsellors, to enlarge the duke of Norfolk lately imprisoned, and recommend other discountenanced men of quality to the queen's favour: As for her majesty, they were, and resolved to be always, her most obedient sub∣jects, ”and should never attempt any thing against her.</Q> Besides this manifesto, they sent circular letters to the Roman catholics, to exert themselves, and join them: But these men, as Camden says, were so far from closing with the invita∣tion, that most of them sent up their letters, with those that brought them, to the queen; and, from all quarters of the kingdom, offered the crown their assistance against the rebels. The chief banner the insurgents displayed, had the crucifixion represented thereon, with Christ's five wounds, which was borne by Richard Nor∣ton, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> of Norton-Coniers, who, with his sons, Christopher, Marmaduke, and Thomas, (expressly named by Camden) distinguished themselves on this occasion; the banners of the two earls are named in the old ballad given in the notes. They marched to Durham, where, meeting with no opposition, they entered the churches, tore and defaced the bibles and common-prayers, and celebrated mass
<PB N="451" REF="501"/>with the ancient ceremonies. They proposed to proceed immediately to York; but receiving intelligence, that the queen of Scots was removed to Coventry, that the earl of Essex had raised a powerful army against them, that Sir Robert Bowes had commanded a number of forces then almost upon their rear, and the lord Scroop and earl of Cumberland had strengthened Carlisle, they turned first to Rabycastle, one of the earl of Westmorland's seats, and thence to Barnardcastle, which was shut against them by Sir George Bowes; at which they were so much irritated, that they determined to reduce it before they advanced farther, and spent eleven days in a siege before the fortress was surrendered. The army ad∣vanced to Clifford-Moor, near Wetherby, where the muster-roll was called over<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and it was found their troops consisted only of 4000 foot and 600 horse. The two earls, who spent their large revenues in hospitality, and were much beloved on that account, were masters of little ready money; the earl of Northumberland brought with him only 2000 crowns, and the earl of Westmorland no cash for the subsistence of their forces; from whence they were unable to proceed: They were disappointed in the support they expected both in men and money. Under such circumstances, the earl of Westmorland began so visibly to despond, that many of his men shrunk away, though the earl of Northumberland still kept up his resolution, and was master of the field till the 13th of December; when the earl of Essex, accompanied by lord Hunsdon, having marched out of York at the head of 7000 men, and being followed by a still larger army under the com∣mand of Ambrose Dudley earl of Warwick, the rebels retreated northwards, first to Raby, then to Auckland and Hexham, and lastly to Naworth-castle, from whence the earls escaped into Scotland: The earl of Westmorland fled to Flan∣ders, where he led a very poor life, even to an advanced old age, living on a slender and ill-paid pension from the crown of Spain; but the earl of Northum∣berland was surrendered by a treacherous borderer, and suffered decapitation at York. Though this insurrection was suppressed with so little bloodshed in war∣fare, the earl of Essex, and Sir George Bowes marshal of the army, delighting in slaughter, put vast numbers to death by martial law, without any regular trial: Sixty-six people were executed at Durham; among whom were Plumtree a priest, Struther an alderman, and several peace officers; many others were put to death at York, and some removed to London: Sir George Bowes made an inhuman boast, that in a tract of country, sixty miles in length, and forty in breadth, betwixt Newcastle and Wetherby, there was scarce a town or village wherein he had not sacrificed some of the inhabitants to his thirst of blood.

<P>Bishop Pilkington being the first protestant prelate that held the bishopric of Durham, was obliged to keep out of the way of the insurgents. Fuller tells us, the reason for parliament taking the forfeited lands from the bishopric of Durham, was the great expence sustained by the state, in defending the bishop's family and his See in that rebellion, <Q>when both his infant daughters, conveyed away in “beggars' cloaths, were sought for, to be killed by the papists." He adds, These afterwards, with four thousand pounds a-piece, were married; the one to Sir James Harrington, the other to Mr Dunce of Berkshire; which portions the courtiers of that age did behold with envious eyes, for which the bishopric ”sped no whit the better<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">b. ix. p. 109.</NOTE>.</Q> In another place<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">b. v. p. 253.</NOTE>, <Q>And I have heard, that “queen Elizabeth, being informed that Dr Pilkington bishop of Durham had given 10,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> in marriage with his daughters, and being offended that a prelate's daughter should equal a princess, in future took away 1000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year from that bishopric, and assigned it for the better maintenance of the garrison ”Berwick.</Q> This payment continued for some time after the bishop's death.</P>
<PB N="453" REF="503"/>
<P>The consequence of reformation was the rife of various sectaries; of those dis∣senters, the puritans were most vehement; avoiding superstition, they assumed an∣other mode of enthusiasm, more inconsistent with Christian rules, pretending to an inspiration of the Holy Spirit, against which kind of blasphemy the most tre∣mendous judgment is denounced in the gospels; when, like the sybils of old, they were only convulsed with the workings of the devil, and the spirit of lying hypocrisy. Collier says<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 494.</NOTE>, <Q>They had several great men, who favoured their in∣terest, “both in church and state; amongst the ecclesiastics, Pilkington bishop of Durham wrote to the earl of Leicester, another of their friends, in their ”behalf.</Q></P>
<P>The year 1564 is remarkable for a contest about the ecclesiastical habit, and va∣rious irregularities which had taken place in the service of the church, represented in a paper sent up to secretary Cecil<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"Some say the service and prayers in the chancel, others in the body of the church; some officiate in a seat, some in the pulpit with their faces to the people; some keep close to the rubrick, others entertain the people with singing psalms between the service; some read with a surplice, and others without it.
<P>"In some places the communion table stands in the body of the church; in some places it stands altar-wife, at a little distance from the wall; in others, in the middle of the chancel.</P>
<P>"Some administer with a surplice, and others with none; some with a communion cup, and others with a common one.</P>
<P>"Some receive kneeling, some standing, and others sitting.</P>
<P>"Some baptize in a font, and others in a bason; some sign with a cross, and others omit it; some admi∣nister this sacrament in a surplice, and others appear without it.</P>
<P>"Some of the clergy wear square caps, some round ones, and some hats; some appear in the habit of scholars, and others without that distinction."—Cecilian's Life of Archbishop Parker, MS.</P></NOTE>, which displays a most shocking contrast to the ancient solemnities; for though the reader may not encourage too much ceremony, yet he must condemn slovenliness, negligence, and irreverence in the holy places, where <HI>the presence</HI> is invoked by <HI>two or three gathered together in the name of God.</HI> Bishop Pilkington had brought home with him some Calvinistical fancies; he entertained scruples about the habit, and disliked the cap and surplice, though not to that degree as to refuse wearing them: However, he was by no means for forcing compliance upon other people; but when he observed this mat∣ter was going to be urged by the court, he wrote a long and earnest letter, dated from Auckland the 25th of October, 1564, to the earl of Leicester, entreating him to use his interest to oppose it<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 494.—E. MS. CCCC. Miscell. B.—Strype's Life of Abp P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rker. l. ii. c. 19.</NOTE>. Some of the most striking passages are, <Q>“That in those superstitious parts where he lived, priests went with swords and daggers, and such coarse apparel as they could get, not regarding colour or fa∣shion: That this realm had a scarcity of preachers, and many places were left destitute of any: The bishops wearing their white rochets, began first of Sisi∣mus, an heretic bishop of the Novatians; and the others have the like founda∣tion.”</Q> He justifies himself, and answers the objection <HI>Medice cura <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cipsum,</HI> from St Paul's practice, who, he says, used circumcision for a time, as of liberty; but when it was urged of necessity, he would not bend to it. Bucer, when he ask∣ed why he did not wear <HI>quadrato pilco?</HI> made answer, <HI>quia caput non est quadratum.</HI>
<PB N="454" REF="504"/>Whittingham, the then puritanical dean of Durham, also wrote to the earl a letter, full of follies and improprieties, which shall be noted hereafter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A.

See Spar∣row's Collections.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From the troublesome state of public affairs, we cannot wonder that no works in this province are attributed to bishop Pilkington. The hands of ecclesiastics were busied in defacing the ornaments of the churches, and, under colour of re∣moving objects of superstition, spoiling and pillaging many comely decorations, which contributed to the solemnity and dignity of the holy places. The bishop vi∣sited his cathedral on the 29th of October, 1561<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Skinner's Reg. p. 142, 143.</NOTE>; and again on the 1st of Octo∣ber, 1567: It is probable, the latter visitation was in consequence of orders, issued by the queen's commissioners, for the removal of superstitious books, and defacing plate in churches remaining in superstitious fashion. Such orders were issued about this time<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vide several instruments for the purposes here mentioned in bishop Sancroft's <HI>Collectanea Curiosa,</HI> vol. ii. p. 274, 275, &amp;c. printed at Oxford, 1781.</NOTE>: But the bishop was still attentive to the possessions of his See, as will appear in the extract from the 2d vol. of Strype's Annals given in the notes<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">JAMES PILKINGTON, the grave and truly reverend bishop of Durham, deserveth to have some notice taken of him, being one of the pious exiles, that at their return were the first bishops settled in the newly reformed church of England. He was still alive, but by reason of his age very much pinched by the winter's cold in that northern part of the nation. The queen required residence of her bishops in their dio∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es; and would not permit them to come up to London without special leave; that they might keep hos∣pitality, and their presence might awe the papists, specially in those parts. It was now September in the de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lining of the year, when this good bishop signified to the lord treasurer, both his desire to come into these southern quarters for the avoiding the extremity of the winter season, and also his pious acquiescence in God's disposal of him, what ever should happen. For these were his words to that lord, <HI>That the common griefs that he had suffered there for sundry winters past, made him to think what he should look for the winter that was then at hand. That it had begun so sharply with him already, that he feared the latter end would he worse: And therefore, if his lordship thought good to move her majesty, that he might come up this winter, he should de∣sire him to let him understand her highness's pleasure. That if his wisdom thought the time served not for such a motion, he should content himself, and commit himself to his hand that had both lise and death, health and sickness, at his commandment. There is a highway out of all countries, out of which free passage. I pray God, I doubt not.</HI> And then, to incline the queen to allow of his absence from thence, he shewed, <HI>That the country there (prais∣ing God for it) was outwardly quiet enough, and that more continuers than aforetime would abide there, as Sir George Bowes and his brother were there (at Durham) besides others of the council at York. He appointed no∣thing, but referred him wholly to his lordship's discretion, to deal for him as he saw cause. Only this he would crave of his goodness, to know with such convenient speed as might be, what he might do with good leave, come or tarry, that he might prepare himself thereafter; for when the weather should be sharper, he should not be able to travel, if he would hereafter.</HI> And then he ended with a prayer: <HI>The great God long preserve you to serve him, to his glory, his lordship's honour, and the comfort of the people.</HI>

<P>It may be added here, concerning the bishop, what labour and care he took to preserve the revenues of his bishopric, (some parts whereof were unrighteously detained till the year 1565) and the endeavours he used for the recovery of them.</P>
<P>The following were the detained lands and their values, as he wrote them down, and sent the paper there∣of to Sir William Cecil, secretary. The values were according as the lord treasurer had rated them.</P>

<P>All parcels of the county palatine.</P>
<P>The state of this business the bishop set down after this manner in a letter to Cecil, hoping to have some order by his means:</P>
<P><HI>GRATIA &amp; Pax.</HI> I have sent your honour a note of such lands as be detained from me, with the valor of them, as the lord treasurer rated them. Norham, and the shire, is exempted from Cumberland, and made part of the county palatine of Durham, and of as great liberties. So is Creik in al things from York∣shire. And al suits and prisoners come to Durham. Allerton has great liberties, but not fully so much. Al other parcels lie within the county of Durham.</P>
<P>The inconveniences in detaining them, as the lawyers say, is such, that al such as holde any lands within these parcels of the bishop. cannot sell, nor aliene, nor make a good conveyance or state in law, to any per∣son; not so much as a jointure to his wife, as hath been proved of late; nor sell any part after his office found. Because the bishop cannot give him his <HI>liberate</HI> of them: As even now is in experience by one Clax∣ton, that sold his land to Perkinson. Who procured divers of the councils letters, that I would grant him his <HI>liverie.</HI> Which I cannot, being exempted from me. Nor the queen's majesty nauther can graunt it him; for that she holdeth them contrary to law. And having not his liverie, say the lawyers, <HI>Nullum ei restat liberum tenementum.</HI> The like is judged to be in copyholders and leases also. Which causeth great murmurings among the people, and maketh many intruders and usurpers. Whereof must needs issue infinite suits, brawlings, and quarrellings. Which I am sorry should chance in the time, or by occasion of any that professes Christ's Gospel. And surely the people say, this is the fruit of our religion, to procure such mis∣chiefs. I can wish the amendment of it, but God must work it. And for my own part, I wil be no partaker of any such injuries to so many people, so farre as I may avoid it.</P>
<P>Furthermore, it were time. The danger is great; The shire is smal. And yet if any of the wardens of the marches send for aid to the bishop on the sudden, he must give them help. The shire is divided into four wards. Of which is detained from me a ward and an half. There be seven lords within the shire, Northum∣berland, Cumberland, Westmorland, Dacres, Evers, Scrope, Lumley; that have great lands and liberties; where the bishop hath not to do. Beside the dean and chapter, and the great liberty of the queen's majesty's lands in Bernard's Castle, and other supprest lands; of which none be at the bishop's command. Al these being taken from the bishop, it is easy to see what aid the bishop shall be able to give in time of need. For none of the others do sturre without special commandment from the prince: Nor be at the warden's com∣mandment.</P>
<P>But this harm is not only in war, but in commissions, juries, carriages, &amp;c. None, or sew of these, do serve the queen, save only the bishop's tenants, and few of the poorer freeholders. The commodities, which be thought great for the wardship, marriages, and reliefs, I assure your honour, are very smal. For every man almost hath purchased supprest lands, and so become wards to the queen. Truly, I have had only one poor relief these five years, of 20 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> for al offices that were found. Coals, which is the great commodity of the country, there is none at al within these detained lands; nor wood, saving a little at Allerton: Out of my woods, I give the tenants of these detained lands for their reparations. This commodity I have by it. Besides, that I pay the queen's majesty her rent duly, although they pay me slowly.</P>
<P>God graunt, that these things may be duly considered; and then it wil easily appear, whether I seek mine own profit, or the advancement of justice, and avoiding of injuries and mischiefs to many people, 'The Lord long preserve you to serve him, and his people to his glory, their confort, and your heart's ease.</P>
<P>Yours wholly JA. DURESME.</P>
<P>The bishop, who was thus diligent and conscientions in soliciting the recovery of the lands and lordships aforesaid, for the good of his church, was at last successful, and did obtain the restoration of them again, by the good assistance of Cecil; but still with the burthen of a considerable rent-charge to be paid to the queen, her heirs and successors, of 1020 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> yearly, as appears by an authentic paper, expressive of the same; that is, for the manors and lordships situate in the county of York and bishopric of Durham 880 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> For those in Northumberland and Elandshire, in the county of Northumberland 140 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> These lands were re∣tained by virtue of an act of parliament made in the first year of the queen.</P>
<P>The paper (belonging to bishop Hutton's time) bears this title: "A parcel of possessions late of the bi∣shopric of Durham, now retained in the hands of our sovereign lady Elizabeth, by vertue of an act of parli∣ament in the first year of her reign." And then are set down the names of the lordships and manors situate in the counties of York and Durham. And then follows: <HI>Quae omnia praemissa concessa fuerunt Jacobo nuper episcopo Dunelmensi; ac modo Matthaeo episcopo Dunelmensi: Reddendo inde dominae reginae, haeredibus &amp; successo∣ribus suis per annum</HI> 880 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> And after this, there is a particular of the possessions in Northumberland; and the yearly payments for them, viz. 140 <ABBR>l.</ABBR>; and then, at the bottom thereof is writ, "Memorandum, these two sums above-mentioned have been yearly answered to her majesty, since the first retaining of the same hitherto."</P>
<P>He commenced a suite with queen Elizabeth in the 13th year of her reign 1571, for forfeitures of the lands and goods of Charles Nevil earl of Westmoreland and other outlaws in the county, who had been in actual rebellion against their country; and had prosecuted this suite if the parliament had not interposed, when an act was passed for attainting the earl and others of the rebellion, the bishop's right to the forfeitures within the county palatine is thereby declared and saved, tho' for that time the charge of the war to rescue the bi∣shopric and suppress that rebellion, and other reasons of state, occasioned them to be given to the queen upon some recompence to the bishop.</P>
<P>Upon the restoration of king Charles II. in the 12th year of his reign 1661, an act of parliament was made which took away the court of wards and all wardships through the kingdom.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="455" REF="505"/>
<P>The bishop was far from indolent in ecclesiastical duties; for he wrote several religious tracts, that were well received; besides the sermon preached by him at
<PB N="456" REF="506"/>St Paul's Cross, on the burning of St Paul's cathedral<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Strype's Annals, vol. i. p. 227.</NOTE>.

Besides those, he was author of an exposition of the book of Ecclesiasti∣cus, and the epistles of Peter and Paul to the Galatians.</P>
<P>In Whittingham's Register, there are instances where the bishop stiles himself "by the grace of God<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. ii. p. 144.</NOTE>, <HI>miseratione divina</HI><NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 161.</NOTE>, and <HI>reverendissimus</HI><NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 180.</NOTE>." He de∣parted this life on the 23d day of January, 1575, aetat. 55, and was first buried at Auckland; but afterwards removed, and interred in the choir at Durham cathe∣dral, before the high altar, at the head of bishop Beaumont's tomb: His epitaph was a piece of refined monumental flattery, and gives him more than his share of excellencies<NOTE N="‖‖" PLACE="foot">Willis, in his Cath. vol. i. p. 246, says, "On his grave-stone several verses were engraved on brass plates, long since defaced;" and quotes them from a manuscript preserved in the Bodleian library, as follows:

The bishopric of Durham was divested of many of its honours; the power of its prelate was be∣come greatly limited, when compared with ancient times; and the bishops, after the reformation, possessed not the honours and employments of the court: Yet
<PB N="459" REF="509"/>the palatinate held those charms which allured the wishes of the clergy.

<P>The deplorable account this prelate gave of the people of his palatinate to the lord treasurer, is set forth in the following letter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype's Ann. vol. ii. p. 482.</NOTE>: <Q>In the mean time, I assure “your good lordship, the people of Northumberland are far more pliable to all good order, than these stubborn churlish people of the county of Durham, and their neighbours of Richmondshire, who shew but, as the proverb is, <HI>Jack of Napes's charity</HI> in their hearts. The customes, the lives of this people, as their country is, is truly savage; but truly such hast to amend (tho' it be for some) as is zelous; and yet none extremity shewed to any, otherwise than by threat∣ning, which hath wrought <HI>pannicum timorem</HI> in their minds, and in the clergy a good readiness to apply their travells to their callings: Onely that <HI>Augie stabu∣lum,</HI> the church at Durham, exceeds; whose stink is grievous in the nose of ”God and men, and which to purge far passeth Hercules labours.</Q> From the pen of this prelate fell the greatest condemnation any writer, in any age, ever cast upon the people of this province: It differs so widely from the accounts given by other authors, that much discredit goes along with it. It proceeded from resent∣ment,
<PB N="463" REF="513"/>or perhaps some sinister purpose of irritating government against the palati∣nate, on which some private interest depended, or to aggrandize his own character in the work of reformation of manners, in which he declared he was labouring, he thought it necessary to depreciate the people. The bishop proceeds in his account to the following effect: <Q>I have an external shew of some dutiful obedience, but “their dealings underhand are nothing less; so that I sear I shall be enforced to weary his honour and the lords with the reforming their disorders, which are more than as yet I am well able to undergo. Nevertheless I promise to do all ”my endeavours first, even to the uttermost.</Q> And how it stood with him in the people's affections for this service, and the malice and slander he underwent from many, take his own words to the same lord: <Q>The Lord of his endless and infinite “mercies bless her highness; and as he hath stirred up her heart to tender my faithful travel in advancing virtue and religion, and in weeding out vices, and banishing popery, superstition, and the remainants of idolatry; whereby the malicious of this country are mervailously exasperated against me: And whereas at home they dare neither by words nor deeds deal undutifully against me, yet abroad they practise to deface me by all slanders, false reports, and shameless lies, though the same were never so inartificial or incredible, according to the northern guise, which is never to be ashamed, however impudently they bely and deface him whom they hate, yea, though it be before the honourablest.

<P>Bishop Barnes was in enmity with archbishop Grindal, and spoke disrespectfully of him, which occasioned the lord-treasurer Burleigh to write to him soon after the archbishop's disgrace. Barnes, in his answer, maintains an equivocal stile, and, courtier like, throws out imputations on the archbishop for contempt of the regal power, but doth not charge him with want of sincerity towards the church. Strype, who gives an account of this correspondence, says, <Q>That bishop Barnes “had no good-will towards the archbishop, who, not long before, had dealt against him for some defects, either in discharge of his episcopal function, or for his ”bribe-taking officers.</Q> This leads us to observe, that he countenanced the most rapacious acts in the ecclesiastical court of his diocese, where John Barnes his bro∣ther presided as chancellor, and was the tyrant of the country; considering his power only as the means of gratifying his vicious inclinations, among which, as avarice bore a ruling part, oppression was a natural effect. It appears probable that the bishop decried the people to prejudice the minister's ear, and shut it against their complaints; that the customs and lives of the palatinates were depict∣ed savage, to cover their cries; and that the ecclesiastical court was the Augean stable, which no labour could cleanse of its iniquity. Between this infamous chancellor and the truly apostolic Bernard Gilpin there was an opposition for many years; the latter endeavouring to counteract the former, and to be the redresser of those injuries of which he was the author: Those matters perhaps irri∣tated the mind of our prelate against that good divine; some warm animadversions past between them; and the great lines of this prelate's character appear in the following circumstances, as related in the British Biography, vol. iii. p. 117.—
<PB N="464" REF="514"/><Q>“Gilpin received a message one day from the bishop of Durham, appointing him to preach a visitation sermon on Sunday following: It happened he was then preparing for his journey into Readsdale and Tynedale; he acquainted the bishop therefore with the necessity of keeping that appointment, begging his lordship would at that time excuse him. His servant informed him that the bishop had received his message, but returned no answer: Concluding him therefore satis∣fied, he set out on his journey; but was greatly surprised, on his return home, to find himself suspended; some persons, through enmity to him, having put the bishop on this hasty step. A few days after, he received an order to meet the bishop at Chester: Here many of the clergy were assembled, and Mr Gilpin was ordered by the bishop to preach that day before them. He made many excuses, and al∣ledged that he had come wholly unprepared. The bishop would not, however, admit of any of his apologies, but required him, upon his canonical obedience, to go immediately into the pulpit. After a little delay, therefore, he went up; and though he observed several taking notes of what he said, he proceeded with∣out the least hesitation. The ecclesiastical court at Durham was at that time very scandalously governed: The bishop was a weak man, irresolute, and wholly in the hands of others: Every thing was managed by his relation chancellor Barnes, whose venality, and the irregularities occasioned by it, were most noto∣rious. This induced Mr Gilpin to lay hold of the present opportunity to open the bishop's eyes; private information had often been given to the prelate, but without success. Mr Gilpin was now resolved, therefore, to venture upon a pub∣lic application to him: Accordingly, before he concluded his sermon, he turned towards the bishop, to whom he thus addressed himself: 'My discourse now, reverend father, must be directed to you. God hath exalted you to be the bi∣shop of this diocese, and requireth an account of your government thereof. A reformation of all those matters which are amiss in this church is expected at your hands. And now, lest perhaps while it is apparent that so many enormities are committed every-where, your lordship should make answer, that you had no no∣tice of them given you, and that these things never came to your knowledge,' (for it seems this was the bishop's common apology to all complaints)," 'be∣hold, I bring these things to your knowledge this day. Say not then that these crimes have been committed by the fault of others, without your knowledge; for whatever either yourself shall do in person, or suffer through your connivance to be done by others, is wholly your own. <HI>Therefore in the presence of God, his an∣gels, and men, I pronounce you to be the author of all these evils; yea, and in that strict day of the general account, I will be witness to testify against you, that all these things have come to your knowledge by my means; and all these men shall bear witness thereof, who have heard me speak unto you this day.'</HI> "This freedom alarmed every one; the bishop, they said, had now got that advantage over him that had been long sought for: His friends expostulated with him on what he had done; but Mr Gilpin assured them, that if his discourse should do the service he intend∣ed by it, he was regardless what the consequence might be to himself. He after∣wards went to the bishop to pay his compliments before he went home. 'Sir,
<PB N="465" REF="515"/>says the bishop, I propose to wait upon you home myself.' This he accordingly did; and as soon as Mr Gilpin had carried him into a parlour, the bishop turned suddenly round, and seizing him eagerly by the hand, 'Father Gilpin, says he, I acknowledge you are fitter to be bishop of Durham than I am to be parson of this church of yours.—I ask forgiveness for past injuries!—forgive me, father! I know you have enemies; but, while I live bishop of Durham, be secure, none ”of them shall cause you any further trouble.</Q></P>
<P>Fuller, speaking of the bishop, says<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. ix. p. 191.</NOTE> <Q>That he was one commendable of him∣self, “but much suffering for the corruption and viciousness of John Barnes, his ”brother and chancellor.</Q></P>
<P>He visited his cathedral church in the year 1580, repaired the palace at Stock∣ton, and laid out a considerable sum at Auckland and Durham. In the twenty-first year of Elizabeth, he got exemplified many ancient grants relative to the See, from the reign of Henry V. to the eighth year of her majesty; and in the twenty-third of that reign he had a suit with his copyholders in Allertonshire, in the court of requests, for settling their fines, which his officers had aggravated beyond the ancient customary rule.</P>
<P>Dean Matthews, who had an eye to the succession, or otherwise was desirous of saving the bishopric from depredations which were then devised at court, in a letter to Francis Mills, then attending on secretary Walsingham, represents its deplorable state in the following expressions<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Strype's Ann. vol. ii. p. 463.</NOTE>: <Q>The bishopric greatly impaired; the best “things of it demised at length, and no provision at all of corn by rent or other∣wise. The rate very high in the queen's books, 1700 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a-year going out <HI>com∣munibus annis.</HI> The diocese, namely Northumberland, specially about the bor∣ders, most wretched and miserable, enough to burst the heart of a well-meaning pastor; so small assistance for the public service of religion.

And yet, if God would send it, it should be welcome; if otherwise, he was but where he was before, and in better place than happily he deserved, as he humbly ex∣pressed ”himself.</Q></P>
<P>After presiding in this See for eleven years and upwards, the bishop departed this life on the 24th day of August 1587, in the fifty-fifth year of his age, and was in∣terred in the choir of the cathedral.

And all these excellent qualities he reckoned cen∣tered in Grindal; for, as he added, such a man was the bishop of London known to be. I the rather mention this in this place, because I can't help thinking that those persons, who afterwards recommended Dr Hutton to the same high degree in the church, were not negligent to examine whether such grand qualifications as he attributed to Grindal, might not be found as equally centered in himself. Bishop Grindal being translated from London to York, secretary Cecil wrote to
<PB N="469" REF="520"/>archbishop Parker, to know whom he thought proper for the See of London; among others enquiring, what he thought of Hutton dean of York? To which Parker answered, that he took him for an honest, quiet, and learned man, but he thought him not meet for that place. Whilst he was dean of York, hearing that one Mr Hammond of Yorkshire designed to apply to the archbishop of Can∣terbury to dispense with his son, a young boy, being made a prebendary of York, he wrote to the archbishop against it, and to desire it might be bestowed ”on a preacher.</Q> In the year 1586 he was one of the presidents of the convoca∣tion of the province of York, who granted a subsidy and benevolence to the queen.

<P>Here I must clear the memory of this worthy prelate from mistake committed, surely not wilfully, but throught false intelligence, by a pen otherwise more ingenious, and professing respect to him and some famili∣arity with him. <Q>This archibishop his eldest son is a knight, lately sheriff of Yorkshire, and of good <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epu∣tation. “One other sn he had, Luke Hutton by name, so valiant that he feared not men nor laws; and, for a robbery done on St Luke's day, for name's sake he died as sad a death, though I hope with a better mind, as the thief of whom St Luke writes.

<P>N. B. The annexed portrait of bishop Matthew is copied from Boissard. There is a painting of him in the hall of Christ Church, Oxon; and another in the bishop's library at Durham.</P></NOTE>, and born in that part of the city which lies in Somersetshire. He received the first ru∣diments of learning in the city of Wells; and at the age of thirteen became a student in the university of Oxford, in the beginning of the year 1559. In Christ-Church college he took the degree of bachelor of arts, on the 11th of February 1563; and, on the 25th of June 1566, was made master of arts: About which time he took holy orders, and was greatly respected for his learning, eloquence, conversation, friendly disposition, and the sharpness of his wit. On the 2d day
<PB N="473" REF="525"/>of November 1569 he was unanimously elected public orator of the university, which office he filled to the honour of his electors, and with great applause. In the year 1570 he was made canon of the second stall in the cathedral of Christ-Church, and on the 28th of November following was admitted archdeacon of Bath. In 1571 he petitioned for his degree of bachelor of divinity, but was not admitted thereto for two years. In 1572 he was made prebendary of Teynton-Regis with Yalmeton in the church of Salisbury, and in July following was elected president of St John's college in Oxford; at which time, being in high reputation as a preacher, he was appointed one of the queen's chaplains in ordinary. On the 10th of December 1573 he was admitted bachelor of divinity; and in the next year, on the 27th of May, proceeded doctor. On the 14th of June 1576, being archdeacon of Bath, he was commissioned by archbishop Grindal, with some others, to visit the church, city, and deanry of Bristol<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype's Grind. p. 211.</NOTE>. In the same year he was made dean of Christ-Church; and then obtained, from the pen of Camden, the distinguished character of <HI>Theologus praestantissimus;</HI> who says, that in him <HI>doctrina cum pietate &amp; ars cum natura certant</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Edm. Campian the jesuit, in his book of Ten Reasons, labouring to prove that the fathers were all pa∣pists, and to give the uttermost he could to his assertion, saith, that Toby Matthew confessed to him so much. <Q>“<HI>Parentavimus,</HI><NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Puto <HI>Pertentavimus.</HI></NOTE> saith he, &amp;c. <HI>We did once in a familiar sort sound Toby Matthew's opinion, he that now do∣mineers ”in your pulpits, whom for his good learning and seeds of virtue we esteemed,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> Which character coming from a jesuit's pen, makes it the truer, because he was in some manner his adversary.
<P>Let us now see him described by another person (Hist. and Antiq. Oxon, lib. ii. p. 255.). "Infinitae prope∣modum lectionis vir, librum pene nullum, quem vel scriptoris fama vel ipsum operis argumentum com∣mendaret, intactum praetermisit; memoriam quoque tam tenacem habuit, ut legenti sese paucislima obtu∣lerint quae non, siquando usus flagitaret, confestim proferret."</P>
<P>Sir Sir John Harrington gives us the following account of him: "During his abode there, being dean of Christ-Church, it was hard to say whether he was more respected for his great fearning, eloquence, autho∣rity, countenance given him by the queen and the great ones; or beloved for his sweet conversation, friend∣ly disposition, bounty, that even then shewed itself, and above all, a chearful sharpness of wit, that so sauced all his words and behaviour, that well was he in the university, who could be in the company of Toby Mat∣thew; and his name grew so popular and plausible, that they thought it a derogation to their love to add any title of doctor or dean to it; but if they spake of one of his men, as he was ever well attended, they would say Mr Matthew, or Mr Toby Matthew's men.—View, &amp;c. p. 196.—Le Neve, p. 97.</P></NOTE>; <HI>virtutum &amp; pietatis ornamentis erudita facundia &amp; docendi as∣siduitate reverendissimum existere.</HI> In 1579 he served the office of vice-chancellor of the university<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Fuller says, that none could condemn him for his chearful spirit, though often he would condemn him∣self for the levity of it; yet he was so habituated therein, that he could as well not be as not be merry. Pun and quibble were then in high vogue, and a man was to expect no preferment in that age, either in church or state, who was not a proficient in that kind of wit. He is reported to have said, at his leaving Durham for a benefice of less income, that it was <HI>for lack of grace.</HI> Sir. J. Harrington and Mr Fuller have thought fit to record two or three remarkable stories, which we shall beg leave to subjoin, for the reader's better notion of our prelate's readiness in this way. <Q>Being vice-chancellor of Oxford, and some slight matters “and men coming before him, one man was very importunate to have the court stay for his counsel. Who is your counsel? says the vice-chancellor. Mr <HI>Leasteed,</HI> answers the man. Alas, replies the vice-chan∣cellor, no man can stand you in <HI>less stead.</HI> No remedy! adds the other—Necessity has no law! In∣deed, ”quoth he, no more I think has your chancellor.</Q>
<P><Q>“Another man was to be bound in a bond, very like to be forfeited, and came in great haste to offer it, saying, he would be bound if he might be <HI>taken in:</HI> Yes, says the judge, I think <HI>you will be taken in;</HI> what is your name? <HI>Cox,</HI> says the party, and so pressed, as the manner is, to come into court. Make ”him room there, said the chancellor; let that <HI>Cox come</HI> in.</Q>—Le Neve, p. 98.</P></NOTE>. At a convocation held in 1580, archbishop Grindal being then under the queen's displeasure, it was agreed, that our prelate, then dean of
<PB N="474" REF="526"/>Christ-Church, should, in the name of that assembly, draw up an humble address to her majesty, for the archbishop's restitution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the address in Le Neve, p. 100.</NOTE>; but it was not received favourably. On the 22d day of June 1583 he was collated to the precentorship of Salisbury, and the third of September following was made dean of Durham, being then 37 years of age, whereupon he resigned the precentorship. <Q>From this time to the “23d Sunday after Trinity, in the year 1622, he kept an account of all the ser∣mons he preached, the place where, the time when, the text what, and if any at court, or before any of the prime nobility: By which it appears, that he preached, while dean of Durham 721, while bishop of Durham 550, and while archbishop of York to the time abovementioned 721, in all 1992 sermons, and amongst them several extempore. This prelate certainly thought preaching to be the most indispensible part of his duty; for in the diary before quoted, wherein, at the end of each year, he sets down how many sermons he had preach∣ed, at the end of the year 1619, <HI>Sum. ser.</HI> 32, <HI>eheu!

The Lord forgive me</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Le Neve, p. 105, 111.—It is a little surprising that we find none of the archbishop's sermons in print except his <HI>Concio Apologetica contra Campianum in Deuteron.</HI> xxxii.</NOTE>.</Q> On the 28th of May 1590 he was inducted to the rectory of Bishopwearmouth, in this county, and in the year 1595 was made bishop of Durham. He was consecrated by archbishop Hutton, by commission; but Le Neve says, he cannot find, either in his diary or elsewhere, the time when, place where, or names of the bishops who assisted at the solemnity. On his consecration he resigned Bishopwearmouth. Upon his nomination to this bishopric, orders were given by the lord treasurer to secure payment to the crown of 880 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum out of Allerton, and 140 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> out of Norham.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Peek's Desider, Curiosa, lib. 5, 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>During the time bishop Hutton held the See of Durham, he suffered the queen to make two great innovations on the privileges of the bishopric; the one was, her nominating to the 12th prebendary in the cathedral church; and the other, her granting a charter of incorporation to Hartlepool: But of these matters more hereafter. King James made a like attempt, in this prelate's time, to incharter the city of Durham; but the bishop instituted a suit in the exchequer, and by the decree made therein, the king's charter was set aside<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Dyer, p. 289.</NOTE>; and the prelate granted one, by which the city was put under the government of a mayor and twelve al∣dermen. It was a singular mark of his benevolence, to give so ample a charter, after having a tedious and expensive suit with the burgesses, who maintained the royal charter against his franchise<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Browne Willis, in his Notitia Parliamentaria, vol. ii. p. 523, says, "The city of Durham was govern∣ed by an alderman and twelve burgesses till the time of bishop Matthew, who changed the name of alderman into that of mayor, and burgesses into that of aldermen."—Le Neve, p. 110.

<P>In the 43d year of Elizabeth, one Anthony Arrowsmith, who held lands at Eg∣gleston, stood mute, and his estates became forfeited to the bishop, he being pressed to death<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Stat. 3 Ed. I. 1272, c. 12. Lord chief justice Hale says, that the punishment of pressing to death did not arise from this statute, but was anciently a punishment by the common law. The words of the statute are, "That notorious felons <HI>qui ne soy voilent mettre en enquestes des felonies soyent mis en la prisone forte et dure.</HI>" As this law therefore is so highly penal, I cannot think, that judges, who have tied the thumbs of cri∣minals together in order to oblige them to plead, can be justified under these words of the statute, though their intentions have been merciful<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It appears by the sessions papers, that this was practised at the Old Bailey in the reign of q. Ann; and perhaps there are later instances, as it still continues to be part of the law of this country. It would be much more reasonable to adopt the practice of the Scotch law: If a criminal stands mute, and will not plead, the trial proceeds as usual, and it is l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st to the criminal to manage his own defence as he shall think proper—Innes's Sum. View of the Scotch Laws.</NOTE>; especially, as whatever might have been the common law, this statute hath superseded it. <HI>Prisone forte &amp; dure</HI> can mean nothing further than, if the criminal will not submit to a trial, he shall be remanded to a most close and severe confinement;—how is it possible then to include pressing to death, with all its apparatus of torture, under these words, especially as the felon, when convict∣ed, had his benefit of clergy?—See Barrington's Observations on Ancient Statutes.—Rymer's Foed. vol. iii. part xi. p. 137, which proves beyond doubt, that what is contended for is the true meaning of the words of the statute, and that it was nothing more than <HI>confinement without nourishment,</HI> which was justified under the words <HI>prisone dure.</HI></NOTE>.

<P>Our prelate was much engaged in political matters: Strype gives a letter of his, dated the 9th of April, 1594, whilst dean of Durham, to lord Burleigh, touching Bothwell's protection; in which he says, <Q>I pray God the king's protestations be “not too well believed, who is a deeper dissembler, by all mens judgment that ”know him best, than is thought possible for his years.</Q> Such was the character he gave of the prince who was shortly to come to the throne of England.

In this article it was resolved, that the sovereigns of each king should be addressed, to order the settlement of ministers at every bor∣der church, for the sake of reforming and civilizing the inhabitants, by their salutary instructions and discipline; and for this purpose, the decayed churches should be repaired; and for the safety of the persons of their pastors, and due respect to be paid them in the discharge of their offices, the principal inhabitants ”of each parish should give security to their prince<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ridpath's Bord. Hist. p. 690.</NOTE>.</Q> Sir Robert Carey, about this time, had the appointment of keeper of Norham castle, for which 140 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> was paid out of the revenues of the bishopric of Durham.</P>
<P>In 1603 expired the illustrious queen Elizabeth. The characters of late sove∣reigns require no comment here. Whilst our prelates possessed high offices in the state, and held the ear of the reigning prince, it appeared necessary to draw the great outlines of their lives; as it was observed before, by inference, the private characters of the prelates were deduced.</P>
<P>James VI. of Scotland was proclaimed successor to the throne of England: On his journey southward, the bishop of Durham met him at Berwick<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He gave his warrant to the bishop of Durham to liberate all prisoners,—a strange kind of pleasure to let loose all the villains on the country.</NOTE>, and preach∣ed a congratulatory sermon before him<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Col. Eccl. Hist. vol. it. p. 671.</NOTE>. The bishop was at the famous confer∣ence at Hampton-court, in January, 1603; of which he gave an account at large to archbishop Hutton<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Strype's Ap. to the Life of Whitgift, N<SUP>o</SUP> 45, lib. iv.</NOTE>. Our bishop demised to king James the castle, &amp;c. of Nor∣ham, Norhamshire, and Elandshire, which was confirmed by the dean and chapter on the 2d of April, 1604; and he got some abatement in the payment made from the See to Berwick, and restitution of Durham-house in London<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Fuller says, (lib. x.) "I am eredibly informed from a good hand, how in the days of king James, a Scotchman and a prevalent courtier had swallowed up the whole bishopric of Durham, had not arch∣bishop Bancroft seasonably interposed his power with the king, and dashed the design."—Credible though the information were, yet it was not true; there being no such prevalent courtier, nor no such design 'Tis true, the stomachs of the Scots were sharp set, still crying give, give, but never satisfied; king James as bountiful and open-handed towards them as they could desire. But neither were they so im∣pudent as to crave, nor the king so impotent as to give a whole bishoprie at once. especially so rich a bi∣shopric as this of Durham. But the truth is, that George Hume earl of Dunbar, lord-treasurer of Scotland, and highly favoured by the king, having procured a grant of all the batable grounds, as they then called them, upon the borders of both kingdoms, began to east his eye upon Norham eastle, and the lands about it belonging to the See of Durham, conceiving it a fit place to command all the rest: But being a well-prin∣cipled man, and a great minister of that king, in restoring the episcopal government to the church of Scot∣land, he acquainted bishop Bancrost, with his desires, who, knowing what great use might be made of him for the good of his church, and being sure enough of the consent of Dr Matthew then bishop of Dur∣ham, he thus ordered the buliness. Whereas the revenue of Norham castle and the lands adjoining were valued at 120 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> per ann. in the bishop's rental, it was agreed that the earl should procure of the king an abatement of six score pounds yearly out of the annual pension of a thousand pounds, which had been laid upon the bishopric by queen Elizabeth; that he should obtain from the king, for the said Dr Matthew and his successors, a restitution of his house in the Strand called Durham-house, with the gardens, stables, and tenements thereto appertaining, which had been alienated from that bishopric ever since the dissolution of it by Edward VI. Thirdly, that in consideration hereof, bishop Matthew should make a grant of Nor∣ham castle, and the country adjoining, in fee farm to the king, by him immediately to be conveyed to the earl of Dunbar. And fourthly, that his own turn being thus served, the said earl should join with bishop Bancroft and his friends, for obtaining from the king an act of parliament, whereby both he and his successors should be made incapable of any of the like grants and alienations for the time to come; which, as it was the best market that ever Toby Matthew was at, so was it the best bargain which was ever driven for the church of England: So far from swallowing up that bishopric, that it was the only means to save that, and preserve the rest.—Dr Heylin's Examen Historicum, 8vo. Lond. 1659, p. 176.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the 26th of July, 1606, bishop Matthew was translated to York; which dig∣nity he enjoyed till the 29th of March, 1628; on which day he departed this life, at Cawood; and was buried in our lady's chapel, at the east of York cathedral:

<P>In the History of the Church of York we have the following reflection on our reverend prelate: <Q>Whilst he sate here, if he had not alienated from the See, to “please the duke of Buckingham, York-Place in the Strand, which was no jest, he might have preached and pun'd out to the end of his days, leaving a much better memorial." Fuller says, "he was one of a proper person, and was of a cherefull spirit, yet without any trespass on episcopal gravity, there lying a real distinction between facetiousness and nugacitie. None could condemn him for his pleasant wit, though often he would condemn himself, as so habited therein, he could as well not be, as not be merrie, and not take up an innocent jest, as it lay in the way of his discourse. One passage must not be forgotten: After he had arrived at his greatness, he made one journey into the West, to visit his two mothers; her that bare him at Bristol, and her that bred him in learning, the university of Oxford. Coming neer to the latter, attended with a train suitable to his present condition, he was met almost with an equal number, who came out of Oxford to give him entertainment. Thus augmented with another troop, and remembering he had passed over a small water, a poor scholar, when first coming to the university, he kneeled down, and took up the expression of Jacob, ”<HI>With my staff came I over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gray's Notes.—Ath.

<P>Bishop Neile was in great favour with the king: He sent him to Peterborough, to assist at the solemn service of removing the body of the royal mother, Mary queen of Scots, to be interred at Westminster, the remains being brought thither on the 8th of October, in the year 1612. He and bishop Laud were the heads of the opponents to the puritans, and found means so far to win upon the confidence of the sovereign, as to have the disposal of the church preferments. In the life of bishop Andrews is the following relation: <Q>There is a pleasant story related of “him (bishop Andrews) while he was bishop of Winchester, which was told by Mr Waller the poet to his son-in-law Dr Birch. Waller going to see king James at dinner, on the day on which the parliament had been dissolved, over∣heard a very extraordinary conversation between his majesty, bishop Andrews, and Dr Neile bishop of Durham. These two prelates standing behind the king's chair, James asked them, 'My lords (said he) cannot I take my subjects money when I want it, without all this formality in parliament?' The bishop of Dur∣ham, who was a complete court sycophant, readily answered, 'God forbid, sire, but you should; you are the breath of our nostrils.' Whereupon the king turned, and said to the bishop of Winchester, 'Well, my lord, what say you?' 'Sir,' replied the bishop, 'I have no skill to judge of parliamentary cases.' The king answered, 'No put-offs, my lord; answer me presently.' 'Then, Sir,' said bishop Andrews, 'I think it lawful for you to take my brother Neile's mo∣ney, for he offers it.' Mr Waller said, the company was much pleased with this answer, but the king seemed particularly struck with the wit of it; for a certain lord coming in soon after, his majesty cried out, 'Oh, my lord, they say you <HI>lig</HI> with my lady.' 'No, Sir,' said his lordship, in some confusion, 'but I like her company, because she has so much wit.' 'Why then,' returned the ”king, 'do you not <HI>lig</HI> with my lord of Winchester there<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Sir Edmund Waller, prefixed to his own works, edit. 1722, p. 5, 6.</NOTE>?</Q></P>
<P>In the year 1613, bishop Neile was on that famous inquisition relative to the di∣vorce of Robert earl of Essex and the lady Frances Howard his wife, and was one of the four bishops that certified therein<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Declaration, That Robert earl of Essex and the lady Francis Howard, contracted by shew of marriage, did cohabit in one house, and lie together in one bed <HI>mudus cum nuda et solus cum sola,</HI> and that the said lady Frances did shew herself prompt and ready to be known of him, but that the said earl neither did nor could have knowledge of her; and that the said lady Frances, by inspection of her body, was proved to be apt for carnal copulation with man, and yet was a virgin: And therefore we the said judges deputed in the cause, first invoking the name of Christ, and setting God before our eyes, do pronounce, decree, and de∣clare the pretended marriage to be utterly void and of no effect; and that the said lady was and ought to be free and at liberty from any bond of such pretended marriage <HI>de facto</HI> between them: And that we do pronounce that she ought to be divorced, and we do free and divorce her; leaving them, as touching other marriages, to their own consciences in the Lord.

<PB N="485" REF="539"/>singular records in the English archives: The trial was infamous, and the whole was conducted with a spirit which reflects eternal dishonour on the then subsisting laws of this country: The sentence conveys in strong images its own condemnation. The writer of the Life of James I.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Compl. Hist. of England, vol. ii. p. 729.</NOTE> under the year 1620, has the following remark on our prelate: Speaking of the king's smiling at a satyrical sermon preached before him by one of his own chaplains at Greenwich, chiefly pointed against the lord∣treasurer Cranfield, he thus proceeds: <Q>It seems Neile the bishop of Lincoln was “not by him then, for when any man preached that had the renown of piety, (un∣willing the king should hear him) he would in the sermon time entertain the king with a merry tale, (that I may give it no worse title) which the king would after laugh at, and tell those near him, he could not hear the preacher for the old b— bishop. We must confess this relation smells too rank, but it was too true; and hope the modest reader will excuse it, seeing it proceeds not from any rancour against the prelacy, but to vindicate God's justice to posterity, who never pu∣nishes without a cause; and such like practices as these were doubtless put upon the score, which afterward gave a period to that hierarchy. This man's hand helped to close up the countess of Essex's virginity, when he was Coventry and Litchfield; his heart had this kind of vanity when he was Lincoln; and when he was archbishop of York his head was so silled with Arminian impiety, that in the next king's reign he was looked upon by the parliament to be one of the great grievances of the kingdom. His so near attendance on the king's person was, by being vested with the office of clerk of the closet to his majesty, in which he was continued when bishop of Durham, but the time of his first admission to ”that place I have not yet found<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Le Neve, p. 146.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>In the same year (1613) he was translated to Lincoln, to which he was elected the 17th of January, confirmed the 18th of February, installed by proxy the 14th of May, and in person the 3d of August, 1614. In that year he assisted at the consecration of Overal bishop of Litchfield; on the 6th of May 1615 he consecra∣ted the new chapel at the earl of Salisbury's seat, near Hatfield; in 1617 bishop Neile attended the king in his progress to Scotland, and on his return from thence was translated to Durham. Dr Heylin, in his Life of Archbishop Laud, part I. p. 74, has the following paragraph relating to this translation: <Q>But whatsoever “the king lost by the journey, I am sure the bishop of Lincoln got well by it: For James bishop of Durham dying during the king's abode in Scotland, his majesty bestowed upon him that wealthy bishopric, one of the wealthiest in reve∣nues, but absolutely one of the greatest in power and privileges. Into this bi∣shopric being canonically confirmed on the 9th of October 1617, he presently set himself on work to repair the palaces and houses belonging to it, which he had found in great decay; but he so adorned and beautified them in a very short space, that they that saw them could not think that they were the same. Three thousand pounds he is affirmed by bishop Godwin to have disbursed only on this account, having laid out before no less than a thousand marks on the episcopal
<PB N="486" REF="540"/>houses of the See of Lincoln, besides a good round sum on the house of Brom∣ley, the habitation and retreat of the bishops of Rochester. But that which gave him most content was his palace of Durham-house in the Strand, not only because it afforded him convenient room for his retinue, but because it was large enough to allow sufficient quarters for Buckridge bishop of Rochester, and Laud dean of Gloucester, which he enjoyed when he was bishop of St David's also; some other quarters were reserved for his old servant Dr Linsell, and others for such learned men of his acquaintance as came from time to time to attend upon him; insomuch as it passed commonly by the name of Durham College. A man of such a strange composition, that whether he were of a larger and more ”public soul, or of a more uncourtly conversation, it were hard to say.</Q> The duke of Buckingham was then the royal favourite, and attended the king on this tour. About this period the king issued <HI>A book of toleration for sports and recrea∣tions on Sundays after evening prayer,</HI> enjoining all ministers to read the same under severe penalties. This does not reflect much credit on our prelate, who then held his office of clerk of the closet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pryn's Breviat of archbishop Laud, p. 6.</NOTE>, and at a time when the religious rules were held so lax, as to encourage the way-sliding of many proselytes, and giving much oppor∣tunity to the various sectaries who strove to divide religion into atoms<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The king's declaration 24th May, 1618.—"That for his good peoples lawfull recreations, his pleasure was, that after the end of divine service, they should not be disturbd, letted, or discourged from any law∣full recreations; such as dancing either of men or women, archery for men, leaping, vaulting, or any such harmless recreations: Nor for having of May-games, Whitsun-ales, or Morrice-dances, and setting up of May-poles, or other sports therewith used, so as the same be had in due and convenient time, without impe∣diment or let of divine service: And that women should have leave to carry rushes to the church for the de∣corating of it according to their old custom; withal prohibiting all unlawful games to be used on the Sundays only, as bear-bating, bull-bating, and (at all times in the meaner sort of people by law prohibited) bowl∣ing."
<P>At Ambleside, in Westmorland, I was present at the ceremony of rush-bearing, on the anniversary day of the dedication of the church, and never remember to have seen a procession which gave me so much pleasure.

<P>About the end of April 1627, bishop Neile was sworn of his majesty's most ho∣nourable privy council<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stow's Chron. p. 1043.</NOTE>; on the 9th of October in the same year, was appointed one of the bishops to exercise archiepiscopal jurisdiction during the sequestration of archbishop Abbot; on the 10th, was elected and translated to Winchester; in 1628, assisted at the confirmation of George Monteigne bishop of Durham to the archbishopric of York; in August, assisted at the consecration of Montague bishop of Chichester, of Mawe bishop of Bath and Wells, and, in September, of Curle bishop of Rochester; on the 13th of January, he attended the confirmation of Harsnet archbishop of York; and, on the 24th of October 1630, assisted at the consecration of Pierse bishop of Peterborough.</P>
<P>Le Neve says<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">p. 148.</NOTE>, <Q>An. 1629, June 13, the commons voted that Dr Neile bishop “of Winchester, and Dr Laud bishop of Bath and Wells, be named to be those near about the king, who are suspected to be Arminians, and that they are justly suspected to be unsound in their opinions that way. And on Thursday the 12th of Feb. following, a report was made from the committee of religion, about so∣liciting
<PB N="488" REF="542"/>and obtaining the pardons of bishop Montague, Dr Cosni, Dr Sibthorp, and Dr Mainwaring, in which Oliver Cromwell was one of this warm committee, and informed the house, that the bishop of Winchester gave countenance to some divines that preached flat popery; and it was by this means that Mainwaring (who by censure last parliament was disabled from further preferment) was now advanced to a rich living. If these be the steps, said he, to church preferment, ”what are we shortly to expect<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">His episcopal character, and steady attachment to the true interest of the church and monarchy, gained him many enemies amongst the puritans, who were now grown up to be a powerful faction in this kingdom. No doubt his cafe would have been as bad as archbishop Laud's, had he lived long enough; but he was hap∣pily called away before the flame broke out, dying at York, in the minster-yard, in the house belonging to the prebend of Stillington, 15th Oct. 1640.—Hist. Ch. of York.</NOTE>?</Q> Among other articles in the bishop's defence, he says, <Q>He moved king James, at his taking the communion a few days before “his death, to make a profession of his faith, the faith of the church of England. Whilst bishop of Durham, he brought many to conformity. He spared not any that refused the oath of allegiance, but put many into the <HI>praemunire</HI> for refusing it. Another time he caused all the ministers, church-wardens, &amp;c. to present all recusants. As to the communion-table of stone, set up at Durham, it was set up by the dean, without his privity, but he did not think it a matter worth ven∣turing a jar upon removing it. As to the questions (of Arminianism, as after stiled) he never meddled with them but once, when Dr Baro, at Cambridge, being questioned by some of the heads, wrote a discourse to the said lord Burgh∣ley, chancellor, to justify himself; which discourse he read, and finding him of opinion that God did elect <HI>propter praevisam sidem,</HI> he wrote about a sheet, and maintained, that <HI>Qui destinavit finem, disponit de omnibus mediis ad finem conducen∣tibus;</HI> and that faith, &amp;c. were <HI>effectus,</HI> not <HI>causae electionis.</HI> As to the pardons, two of them he owns to have had a hand in; the other two, viz. the bishop of Chichester's and Dr Mainwaring's, were never sent to him, nor did he know who got his majesty's hand to them; but owns that he should have been con∣senting. As to standing at the <HI>Gloria Patri,</HI> &amp;c. though there be no public constitution enjoining it, yet he held it a duty well becoming all Christians; and ”in some particular churches, as at Wells, it is by their local statutes required.</Q></P>
<P>In the year 1631, he was translated to the See of York; the only instance, Le Neve observes, of one man's passing through six bishoprics. He sat in this last change nine years, <Q>and had the good fortune to live in peaceable, happy times, “and to be taken hence just before the beginning of the times of rebellion and villainy. He departed this life in York, 31st October 1640, the day as remar∣kable as that of his birth, on the eve of the feast of All Saints, before the begin∣ning of that parliament which took away bishops, the common-prayer, and mo∣narchy, and set forth a new confession of faith, a directory with a correction of the 39 articles, and ended in an extirpation of monarchy, and a settlement by ”way of confusion.</Q> He was interred in the chapel of All Saints, at the east end of his own cathedral, but without a monument; his son Sir Paul, though he lest

<P>The See continued vacant only a few days, for on the 3d day of March 1627, GEORGE MONTEIGNE, S. T. P. then bishop of London, was translated to Durham, where he sat only three months, being advanced to the metropolitical See of York, on the 16th day of June 1628.</P>
<P>Bishop Monteigne was born and brought up at Cawood, near York. The His∣tory of the Church of York says, <Q>The inhabitants of Cawood, by tradition, shew “the house where he was born; and it is somewhat extraordinary that he should
<PB N="491" REF="545"/>go a poor boy from that town, being only a farmer's son, and return to it arch∣bishop ”of York, die and be buried in the place where he first drew his breath.</Q> He was sent to Queen's College, Cambridge, and entered in the matricula of that university (10th of December 1586) by the name of Geo. Moonta, for so he stands in the register<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fuller's Worthies.</NOTE>; was admitted fellow in the same college, 1591; was ordained by Howland bishop of Peterborough, January 1594; was junior proctor of the uni∣versity of Cambridge, 1600<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Le Leve, p. 117.</NOTE>; and was for some short time chaplain to Robert earl of Essex, whom he attended in his voyage to Calais. His courage and valour were much applauded: Le Neve says, "out of his gown he would turn his back of no man<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Letters Test. p. 118.—Le Neve.</NOTE>." In the year 1607 he commenced doctor in divinity; was some time lec∣turer in Gresham College, afterwards master of the Savoy, and dean of Westminster, in which preferment he succeeded Dr Richard Neile, who held it <HI>in commendam</HI> with the bishopric of Rochester, but resigned on his translation to Litchfield; he was installed in the deanry on the 10th of December 1610<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Having a great desire to be master of Queen's college, Cambridge, to obtain it he made great promisses, and gave a very goodly piece of plate thereto, with this inscription, <HI>Sic incipio;</HI> but being disappointed, by the election of Dr Davenant, he vowed it should be <HI>sic desino:</HI> But notwithstanding his displeasure, he was afterwards so well reconciled to the college, as to found two scholarships therein.—Clarke's Martyrology, in the life of Dr Preston, p. 83.</NOTE>. In the year 1615, Robert Carre earl of Somerset, on suspicion of being guilty of the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury, was committed to his custody before he went to the Tower. In the year 1617, he was promoted to the bishopric of Lincoln, on the translation of bishop Neile to Durham: In 1618, he assisted at the consecration of Futherby bishop of Sarum: In 1619, was appointed almoner to the king, in the place of An∣drews bishop of Winchester, who resigned against his will: In October, that year, he entertained the king sumptuously at his house at Bryden: On the 4th of June 1620, his majesty kept his Whitsuntide at Greenwich, and received the sacrament from bishop Andrews and our prelate then lord almoner, when he preached his first sermon before the king: On the 9th of July, the bishop assisted at the consecration of Towson bishop of Salisbury; and in March following, the bishop of Winchester and bishop Monteigne, in the name of the assembly, presented a grant of subsidies, passed by the clergy of the province of Canterbury, to the king at Hampton-court. In the year 1621, our prelate was translated to the See of London; in which year he assisted at the consecration of Williams bishop of Lincoln, Valentine bishop of Exeter, Davenant bishop of Salisbury, and Laud bishop of St David's; archbishop Abbot being then thought irregular for casual homicide.</P>
<P>Bishop Monteigne was under the unhappy influence of the times, and did not escape censure: He shewed his principles whilst bishop of London, by his readiness to license publications of a tendency favourable to the unpropitious projects of the court. A sermon, preached by Dr Sibthorpe at Northampton assizes, wherein the royal prerogative was unconstitutionally held forth, was presented by the king's au∣thority to the archbishop of Canterbury to be licensed for publication ‡, which he refused. Rushworth says ‖, <Q>It was carried to the bishop of London, who gave<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Rush worth, vol. i. p. 436.</NOTE> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 444.</NOTE>
<PB N="492" REF="546"/>“a great and stately allowance of it; the good man being not willing that any thing should stick which was sent unto him from the court, as appeareth by the book which is commonly called The Seven Sacraments, which was allowed by his lordship with all the errors, which since that time have been expunged and ”taken out of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"But before this passed the bishop's file, there is one accident which fitly cometh in to be recounted in this place. My lord of London hath a chaplain, Dr Worral by name, who is scholar good enough, but a kind of free fellow like man, and of no very tender conscience: Dr Sibthorp's sermon was brought to him, and <HI>handed over head</HI> as the proverb is; he approved it, and subscribed his name to it: But afterwards, be∣ing better advised, he sent it to a learned gentleman of the Inner Temple, and writing some few lines unto him, craveth his opinion of that which he had done; the gentleman read it, but although he had promised to return his judgment by letter, yet he refused so to do, and desired that Dr Worral would come himself; which being done, he spake to this purpose: What have you done? you have allowed a strange book yon∣der, which if it be true, there is no <HI>meum</HI> or <HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um,</HI> no man of England hath any thing of his own: If ever the tide turn, and matters be called to a reckoning, you will be hanged for publishing such a book. To which the doctor answered, Yea, but my hand is to it; what shall I do? For that, the other replied, you must scrape out your name, and do not so much as suffer the sign of any letter to remain upon the paper,— which accordingly he did, and withdrew his finger from the pye. But what the chaplain well advised would not do, his lord without sticking accomplished; and so being insensibly hatched, it came <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing into the world.—Rushw.

<P>But whilst we record the failings of this prelate, let us not forget the meritorious part of his character. When bishop of London, he laboured with great zeal to pro∣mote the building of St Paul's church, and contributed a large sum of money, out of his revenue, towards that noble work, procuring Portland stone for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> edifice. He was one of the bishops appointed by the king to draw up a form or prayer and thanksgiving, to be used on Sunday the 29th of January 1625, in London, West∣minster, and places adjacent, and on February 19th in all other places in the king∣dom, on account of the plague ceasing. Whilst bishop of London, he would often pleasantly say, that of him the proverb would be verified, "Lincoln <HI>was,</HI> London <HI>is,</HI> and York <HI>shall be:</HI>" Which really came to pass; a series of preferments through which no other prelate so methodically passed<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Le Neve, p. 124.</NOTE>. On the 9th of October 1627 he was appointed with others to exercise archiepiscopal jurisdiction during the sequestration of archbishop Abbot: In the same year he assisted at the consecration of Hall bishop of Exeter; and soon after was translated to Durham, and from thence to York<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

<P>This inscription gives no light to what has been reported of him. The inhabitants of Cawood, by tra∣dition, shew the house where he was born, and tell us, that his mother was a beggar woman, who travel∣ling with her son George to Lincoln, seemed to follow her occupation in that city and the adjacent vil∣lages; but the lad carrying the bag, and one time eating more than what his mother was willing to allow, ran away from her, fearing a severe correction; when, coming to a gentleman's house in the neighbourhood of Cawood, he took compassion on him, first ordered him to attend his kitchen, and perceiving his bright parts, gave him an equal education with his son, which put him in the road to ecclesiastical preferment. In process of time he became bishop of Lincoln, and made enquiry for his mother, who happening to open a gate through which his lordship was to pass to that city, recognised and tenderly embraced her, and or∣dered, that care should be taken of her during life. When the See of York became vacant, many were the candidates that put up for it. The king being in suspence to whom to give it, sent to Monteigne to ask his advice <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w to clear the difficulty. The bishop modestly answered, <Q>If his majesty had faith as a grain “”of mu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> seed, he might say to this Mountain, be thou removed into the sea, and it would obey.</Q> The king rep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d, "Miracles were ceased, and what had faith to do in this point?"— <Q>To convince your “majesty to the contrary, (said the bishop) be only pleased to say to this Mountain, (pointing to himself) be ”thou removed into yonder See, (alluding to York) I am sure your majesty will forthwith be obeyed.</Q> The king smiling, and taking the hint, "Why then, Mountain, (saith he) I will remove thee;" and ac∣cordingly sent him down lord archbishop.—Gent's Hist.

Our prelate was born in St Bride's parish, London, and educated at St Paul's school; was a student and canon of Christ-Church, Oxford, vicar of Bramp∣ton in Oxfordshire, rector of Brightwell in Berkshire, a fellow of Chelsea college, and canon of Hereford. When vice-chancellor of Oxford he exerted himself a∣gainst Calvinism, and was afterwards a distinguished writer and preacher against popery. He appears to have entered the lists against Bellarmine and his friends, with determined resolution, declaring, "That he'd loosen the pope from his chair, though he were fastened thereto with a tenpenny nail." King James commanded his polemical discourses, which are the most considerable of his works, to be printed.</P>

<P>In Barwick's Life of this prelate, we are told, <Q>That his coat of arms and pe∣digree “shew him to be of the same original and stock with that eminent prelate and statesman John Morton, bishop of Ely and lord chancellor of England, afterward archbishop of Canterbury, and cardinal in the reign of Henry VII. by whose management the two houses of York and Lancaster were united: From whence it may be concluded, his ancestors could not be obscure, at least since this cardinal's time; for such persons as he seldom left their kindred without considerable preferments. Undoubtedly he was descended from Thomas or John Morton, whom the cardinal made his heirs, as being sons to two of his brothers. Certain it is, that Sir Thomas Morton of Dorsetshire, who reckoned his descent from one of them, sought out our prelate, acknowledged his kin∣dred, ”and desired his acquaintance.</Q> He was the sixth of nineteen children of Mr Richard Morton, mercer and alderman of York, by Elizabeth Leedale, his
<PB N="496" REF="552"/>only wife. Barwick says, <Q>She was a gentlewoman of a very good family, de∣scended “from the Valvasors by the mother's side, and not only the Valvasors, but the Langdales also; and other gentlemen of eminent worth in Yorkshire ”acknowledged themselves to be of his kindred.</Q> He was born in York on the 20th of March, 1564; educated first in that city, and afterwards at Halifax: In the year 1582 he was sent to St John's college, Cambridge, and put under the tuition of Mr Anthony Higgins, long after dean of Ripon, and a good benefactor to the college; who, quitting the university for church preferment, left Mr Mor∣ton under the care of Henry Nelson, afterwards rector of Hougham in Lincolnshire, who lived to see his pupil advanced to the See of Durham, and many years after. In the beginning of November, 1584, he was elected scholar of the house, into a place of Constable's foundation, peculiar to his own native county of York: In 1586 took the degree of bachelor of arts, and that of master in 1590, having performed all exercises requisite for each degree with great applause. He continu∣ed his studies in the college, at his father's charge, about two years after he was made master of arts; and on the 17th of March, 1592, was admitted fellow into a place of Dr Keyton's foundation, merely on account of his merit, against eight competitors: About the same time he was chosen logic-lecturer for the university, which office he discharged with great ability and diligence, as appears by his lec∣tures fairly written, which were found among his papers, after his decease: In the same year, 1592, he was ordained deacon, and the year following priest, by Dr Howland, bishop of Peterborough: For about five years after this he continu∣ed in the college, prosecuting his private studies, and instructing his pupils: He took the degree of bachelor of divinity in 1598, and about the same time ob∣tained the rectory of Long Marston near York, which was procured for him by his father. But his great parts and worth would not suffer him to lie hid in a country cure; for the earl of Huntingdon, lord president of the council of the north, soon made him his chaplain, on account of his acute disputations with the Romish recusants; queen Elizabeth having given express command to the earl, to convince them by arguments, rather than suppress them by force, expressing upon this occasion <HI>nolo mortem peccatoris.</HI> Upon the death of the earl, Morton returned again to his privacy at Marston, where he continued no long time before the lord Sheffield, who succeeded as lord president, commanded him to hold a public conference, before his lordship and the council at his manor house at York, with two Romish recusants, then prisoners in the castle, which he performed to the great satisfaction of his numerous auditors. In 1602, the plague raging violently at York, he behaved himself with uncommon courage and great charity towards the poor, sick, and distressed: The infected of the lowest class being turned out of the city, had booths erected on Hobmoor, to whom he often repaired from Mars∣ton, to preach and minister consolation to their languishing souls: To relieve the poorest, he carried meat in sacks; but as often as he went thither, he suffered no servant to attend him, saddled and unsaddled his own horse, and had a private door made through the wall of his study, which was in the most distant part of his house, lest infection should be brought to his family. In the same or the fol∣lowing
<PB N="497" REF="553"/>year, Ralph lord Eure being appointed by the queen ambassador extra∣ordinary to the emperor of Germany and the king of Denmark, took him for his chaplain, together with one Richard Crakenthorp, another very learned person, a native of Strickland in Westmorland: Morton, desirous of improvement by seeing foreign countries, readily accepted the employment. Whilst the ambassador staid at Bremen, he obtained leave to visit some of the chief cities and universi∣ties in Germany, which introduced him to the knowledge and acquaintance of several learned men. His stay in those parts was the shorter, because the am∣bassador's commission determined with the death of the queen: However, he im∣proved his time so well, partly in furnishing his own library with books at Frank∣fort and elsewhere, but chiefly in his conversation with learned men, and the obser∣vations he made, that he always highly valued that opportunity. At his return he was appointed chaplain to Roger earl of Rutland, which appointment he liked, not only for the sake of the privacy, but also because it brought him so much nearer London than his former station. In 1606 he took the degree of doc∣tor in divinity, which brought him to the acquaintance of Dr John Overall, re∣gius professor at Cambridge: About the same time he was sworn chaplain in ordinary to James I. and by him presented to the deanry of Gloucester the 22d of June, 1607, through archbishop Bancroft's recommendation: Whilst he held that deanry, the lord Eure, then lord president of Wales, nominated him one of his majesty's council for the marches: On the 12th of July, 1606, he was in∣corporated doctor of divinity in Oxford: After continuing about three years dean of Gloucester, he was removed to the deanry of Winchester, into which he was in∣stalled the 3d of June, 1609; and Dr Bilson then bishop of Winchester collated him to the rectory of Alresford: About the same time, Dr Sutcliffe, dean of Exeter, found∣ed a college at Chelsea, for a certain number of divines, to be employed in answer∣ing the books dispersed by popish emissaries; of which our learned doctor was ap∣pointed a fellow. On the 21st of July, 1610, archbishop Matthew made him a pre∣bendary in the church of York: The same year he preached a sermon before the convocation at St Paul's, on Matt. v. 13; and was to have been chosen prolocutor of the lower house, had he not declined it to make room for a friend. These, and the like public employments bringing him frequently to London, he lodged at the deanry-house of St Paul's, upon the invitation of Dr Overall, then dean of that church; where he became acquainted with the learned Isaac Casaubon, who was entertained and patronised by the same worthy dean; and it was at Dr Morton's charge that a monument was erected in Westminster abbey to Casaubon's me∣mory. In the beginning of the year 1616, our learned doctor was nominated bishop of Chester, and consecrated the 7th of July that year. Dr Barwick says, the king nominated him in the year 1615; and insinuates, as if through an obsta∣cle that arose, and the new prelate's indifference, it was a long time before he was consecrated; that is, about a year and a half: But it appears from Browne Willis to be a mistake, as bishop Massey only died in the preceding month of January. He held the rectory of Stopford <HI>in commendam</HI> with his bishopric: He went to his See as soon as convenience permitted, where he was well received; and there used
<PB N="498" REF="554"/>all possible endeavours to reconcile the nonconformists, and persuade the recu∣sants: He got the offensive Sunday sports repressed, under which the Sabbath had been abused to the great scandal of religion: On the 6th of March, 1618, he was translated to the See of Litchfield, holding with it, <HI>in commendam,</HI> the rectory of Clifton Camvil: About that time he became acquainted with Antonio de Do∣minis, archbishop of Spalatto, who having renounced the communion of the church of Rome, was come over and preferred in England. He used all the means he could to dissuade that inconstant prelate from returning back to Rome. Whilst he continued in that See, he was concerned in two remarkable occur∣rences; viz. detecting the imposture of the boy of Bilson, who pretended to be possessed of an evil spirit; and a poor woman, being condemned to die for witch∣craft, was saved from execution by our good prelate's discovery of the fraud.</P>

His acts of charity were extensive; at Durham, besides his daily alms to the poor at the castle gate, he gave as many gowns of blue cloth to certain poor men as he had been years bishop of Durham, with their diet in the hall four days in the week. He maintained several poor scholars at the university; and there seldom came any scholar to him, either Englishman or foreigner, whom he did not receive and entertain with free hospitality, and dismiss with a considerable gift in money, proportionable to his parts and merit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He gave no preferment in Durham to any but such as were or had been his chaplains, and perfectly well known to himself; except to Maxton in the 8th stall, and Weems in the 2d stall, both being recommended by Charles I.—Gray's MSS.</NOTE>. To the library of St John's college he gave books to the value of four or five hundred pounds, with an intention at last to bestow 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year upon it whilst he lived. Out of an old decayed chapel at Bishop-Auckland he erected a grammar-school, which he endowed with 24 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year for ever.

On the 18th of November, 1635, he exhibited a petition to the king in council, (his jurisdiction having been interrupt∣ed by rapacious court minions) setting forth, "That the bishops of Durham, before and since the conquest, had a county palatine and <HI>jura regalia</HI> by pre∣scription, and appointed their sheriffs; that all writs from Westminster were di∣rected to the bishop, and in the vacancy to his chancellor, and were returnable by the bishop; that the sheriffs of Durham attended not, nor accounted in the exchequer, and prayed they might not:" Which matters were referred to and considered by the judges; and it was ordered, that the bishop or his under-sheriff should only account before the auditor, and pay the fees due for passing a ministe∣rial account, and not otherwise<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The sheriff of Durham's case for being freed from the apposals upon processe in the exchequer.—Ex quodam papyro penes C. Hunter, M. D. Gyll's MSS.
<P>A. D. 1635. By an order made by the archbishop of Canterbury, the archbishop of York, the lord keeper, the lord privy seal, the lord Cottington, and the two secretaries of state (upon a reference to them by his ma∣jesty upon bishop Morton's petition) on hearing counsel for the king and the bishop, and after advising with the two lords chief justices, the lord chief baron, and justice Hutton, it is reported, that the county of Dur∣ham appeared to be a county palatine by prescription, and the bishop appointed the sheriffs.</P>
<P>Also, that the sheriff never was an attendant upon the courts at Westminster, nor returned any writs thi∣ther, he not being an immediate officer to those courts, but had only mandates from the bishop's chancery at Durham to execute the king's processe, and so returned the mandate back to the same chancery, and then the bishop returned the original processe into the courts at Westminster, they being directed only to the bishop.</P>
<P>And by the stat. 27 Hen. VIII. cap. 24, those mandates are directed and warranted.</P>
<P>Also, by the statute 31 Eliz. cap. 9, the bishop is to have a deputy (and not the sheriff) in the courts at Westminster.</P>
<P>And it was further reported, that to oblige the sheriff to attend in the exchequer, would be an insupport∣able charge, and would discourage all men from taking the office of sheriff, the bishop not having any means to compell them to it, and thereby the liberties of the See would be lost and infringed. Wherefore the bi∣shop and sheriff were freed from accounting or attending in the exchequer; but to account before the king's auditor for that county, and he to have a commissioner for taking the oath thereupon, and the charge, and the bishop to pay the sees of a ministerial account.</P>
<P>Which order was confirmed at the council board, and in the star-chamber and exchequer, and is enrolled there, Trinity, 1637.</P>
<P>And the practice hath gone accordingly ever since, and the sheriff was never apposed, either upon his ac∣count or returns, but they have been constantly allowed upon his general oath of office, and the oath upon his accounts. And the officers cannot produce one precedent against the sheriff of Durham, save in the late times when the county palatine was dissolved. And Mr Clement of the treasurer remembrancer's office, and Mr Burnet of the pipe, have both certified for the sheriff, that he hath been constantly cleared from his apposals in both these sides, and only the king's remembrancer's side press for it.</P>
<P>A. D. 1662. By a privy seal, all this privilege and exemption is allowed and confirmed, and the sheriff is declared to be the bishop's officer, and only accountable to him, and therefore Sir Tho. Davison, sheriff, was freed from the recognizance entered for that office in the exchequer, upon the king's restoration.</P>
<P>The stat. 14 Cha. II. cap. 21, allows this privilege, and exempts the sheriff of Durham from accounting in the exchequer, but only before the auditor in the county, and the sheriff may as well attend and account in the exchequer as attend upon his apposals, at one charge and trouble. 13 &amp; 14 Car. II. c. 21, s. 9.</P>
<P>Hillary, 1675. By order of the court of exchequer, the sheriff is discharged from his apposal, upon hear∣ing his case and reasons aforesaid, till further orders.</P>
<P>A. D. 1666. By in order of the chancery at Durham, it is settled, that the sheriff only return his man∣dates into that chancery; and the cursitor, who is the bishop's deputy, that makes the mandates, is to return the processe to London: For it is repugnant to the sheriff to be approved upon a writt not directed to him, and all the writts from Westminster are directed to the bishop, thus indorsed, "16th Aug. 1677<SUP>o</SUP>, Respited by my lord chief baron Montague and baron Littleton, till Trinity term next."</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In 1633, the king having resolved on a journey to Scotland, where he had a de∣sire to be crowned, also with a design of holding a parliament to procure money,
<PB N="501" REF="557"/>and, if possible, to reduce the kirk of Scotland to a perfect conformity with the church of England, bishop Morton entertained the king and his court, with their officers and retinue, at his castles of Durham and Auckland, which cost him 1500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> in one day. Rushworth, giving an account of this tour, says<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Col part ii. p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3.</NOTE>, <Q>He met “with great reception by the way, and sumptuous feastings at York, where he made some stay; and at Raby castle, where Sir Henry Vane, his majesty's late ambassador to the king of Denmark and Swedeland, nobly entertained his majesty; and at Durham, several days that bishop Morton most sumptuously ”entertained his majesty.</Q> In the year 1634 the bishop granted a new founda∣tion or charter to Sunderland, incorporating the burgesses there by the title of a mayor, twelve aldermen, and a common council, which will be particularly no∣ticed in the course of this work.</P>
<P>We have now approached the aera of those civil broils, which filled the state with distraction under the reign of Charles I. the calamities of which times great∣ly affected this palatinate. The political and religious principles which were agi∣tated by the contending parties are well known to every English reader. A war with Scotland took place. Part of the English forces were drawn down to the frontiers, under the command of lord Conway, general of the horse; whilst the main body of the army was encamped near York. The earl of Northumberland, who was to command under the king, remained sick at London; and the earl of Strafford, lieutenant-general, being a necessary member of the king's secret coun∣cil, could not be absent from his majesty. Lord Conway advanced to Newcastle with an army of 3000 foot and 1500 horse; and there received intelligence, that the Scots, 22,000 strong, were preparing to enter England, under the command of Lesley: They passed the Tweed on the 20th of August, 1640, the very day the king set out from London; and marched to Newburn, on the banks of the Tyne, opposite to which place lord Conway had posted his troops, and thrown up lines and breastworks to command the ford. A skirmish ensued, for it could not be called a battle, and the Scotch army gained the pass. Lord Conway retreated precipitately through Durham, and joined the royal army; leaving Newcastle, with all the stores the king had collected there for the compaign, to the hands of the enemy. A panic seized the whole country. Possessed of Newcastle, the Scots presented a new memorial to the crown, full of moderation and temperance; and sent dispatches to the Londoners, to assure them the supply of coals should not be obstructed. A negociation speedily took place, and the commissioners met at Ri∣pon, where certain articles were agreed upon, as preliminary to a treaty; among which was a provision for the maintenance of the Scotch troops, which had subsist∣ed heretofore in violence, by foraging and contributions raised in Cumberland, Newcastle, and Durham. The sum of 850 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> <HI>per diem</HI> was agreed to be levied out of Northumberland, Newcastle, and Durham; and if need required, Westmor∣land and Cumberland were to assist in raising the money: And this burthen con∣tinued till the definitive treaty was concluded on the 7th of August, 1641, when government stood indebted to this county in the sum of 25 663 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 13 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 10 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> in
<PB N="502" REF="558"/>balance. Rushworth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part II. p. 1238.</NOTE> tells us, that <Q>On Thursday, September 3, there came “a summons to Sir William Bellasis, knt. sheriff of the county palatine of Dur∣ham, and Sir William Lambton, knt. two gentlemen of good quality in the same county, (the latter of which was afterwards at York battle, slain fighting under the king's colours); which summons was to appear before general Les∣ley, at his league at Newcastle, on Saturday the 5th of September, by eight of the clock, signed by Montrose, Rothes, and Lindsey; and accordingly they went (having first obtained leave from the king to go) to the Scots quarters for the good of the country; that summons was to require the country to bring in provision to the Scots army, upon payment of money in part, and security ”for the rest, or otherwise they must take it without fecurity.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“At this time Newcastle and the coalmines, that had wont to employ 10,000 people all the year long, some working underground, some above, and others upon the water in keels and lighters, now not a man to be seen, not a coal wrought, all absconding, being possessed with a fear that the Scots would give no quarter; 400 ships using to be there often at a time in the river, not a ship durst come in; an hundred and odd coming to the mouth of the haven the day after the fight, and hearing the Scots had possessed Newcastle, returned all empty, and tradesmen in the town for some days kept their shops shut; many families gone, leaving their goods to the mercy of the Scots, who possessed themselves of such corn, cheese, beer, &amp;c. as they found, giving the owners thereof, or some in their stead, some money in hand, and security in writing for the rest, to be paid at four or six months end, in money or corn; and if they refuse, said the Scots, such is the necessity of their army, that they must take it without security rather than starve. As for the city of Durham, it be∣came a most depopulated place; not one shop for four days after the fight open; not one house in ten that had either man, woman, or child in it; not one bit of bread to be got for money, for the king's army had eat and drank all in their march into Yorkshire; the country people durst not come to market, which made that city in a sad condition for want of food. At this time, a letter came from the lord lieutenant general, to bury or break every upper millstone, and drive and carry away all cattle and goods to a great distance, insomuch that most drove their cattle and sheep into Yorkshire, and removed most of their fa∣milies ”thither also.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“On the 29th of August, Dr Morton bishop of Durham, a learned and mo∣derate bishop, had an account of the defeat at Newburn, and that the king's army was retreating into Yorkshire; whereupon the said bishop went to his castle at Stockton, in the bishopric of Durham, standing on the edge of York∣shire, but he quickly removed thence into Yorkshire; but Dr Belcanqual dean of Durham fled in great haste, because he understood the Scots gave out that they would seize upon him as an incendiary, for writing the king's large decla∣ration against the Scots; all the rest of the clergy of Durham fled away also,

<P>The bishop remained a very short time in Yorkshire, taking his journey to Lon∣don, where, as he went to Westminster to attend in parliament, he was near being torn in pieces by the mob; some crying out to pull him from his coach; others opposed, saying, "he was a good man;" to which it was immediately replied, "but he is a bishop." He often declared afterwards that he believed he should not have escaped, had not a leading man in the tumult exclaimed, "let him go and hang himself," which diverted the inveterate purpose of the rioters. Collier says<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 817.</NOTE>, <Q>the apprentices were drawn down to Westminster to assist the faction and “overawe the honest party. These auxiliaries came to the parliament doors in great bodies; and cried "No bishops." And for a further reinforcement, pe∣titions to the houses came up from several counties, setting forth, that the bishops were a common nuisance; that the decay of trade, the clogging and disappoint∣ing of all business in parliament, was occasioned by the bishops. From thence they advanced to downright railing and insulting their persons, and throwing stones at them, so that they could not come to the lords' house, either by land or ”water, without apparent hazard of their lives.</Q> One author has the following remark on the calamities which at this time afflicted the county of Durham: <Q>“As the first popish innovations and superstitions, which lately overspread our whole church, had their original from bishop Neile and his chaplain Dr Cosins, at Durham; so God hath made that city and bishopricke of Durham (the only county of England stiled by the name of a bishopricke) the seate of our late war, wherein the Scottish armie now resides; to manifest to all the world, that these unhappie civill warres sprung from the bishops, since the seat of them is no where but in this bishopricke; the Scottish general for the most parte hath kept his residence in the bishop of Durham's own palaces, who for fear hath left them ”vacant, and fled that country, which he hath much oppressed.</Q> Such were the illiberal censures thrown out by the bigots of the times, who had reformed all re∣ligion into a drowsy vision.</P>
<PB N="505" REF="561"/>
<P>In the month of March 1640-1, a bill passed the commons for removing the bishops from their seats in parliament, and on the 27th of May following it passed the house of pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs. On the 15th of June the commons voted, that all deans, deans and chapters, archdeacons, prebendaries, chanters, canons, petty canons, and their offi∣ce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, shall be utterly abolished; that all the lands taken from deans and chapters shall be employed to the advancement of learning and piety, provision being made that his majesty be no loser in his rents, first-fruits, and other duties; and that a competent maintenance shall be made to the several persons concerned, it such per∣sons appear not to be delinquents<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rapin.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the 30th of December, 1641, bishop Morton was accused of high-treason, and committed to the custody of the usher of the black rod, for joining with eleven of his brethren in a protestation against all the proceedings of parliament, since the 27th day of that month, and such as should be had during the time of their forced and violent absence<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide protest at length, Collier, part ii. p. 818.—Commons Journals, vol. ii. p. 363.</NOTE>. The bishops were brought to the bar the evening of the day of their impeachment; upon which an order was made, <Q>That the lord archbi∣shop “of York, his grace the lord bishop of Durham, the lord bishop of Norwich, &amp;c. being charged of high-treason by the house of commons, shall forthwith stand committed to the prison of the Tower, until the pleasure of this house be ”further known.</Q> But by an order of the same day, the bishops of Durham, Coventry, and Litchfield, in regard to their age and ill health, had the favour of being remitted to the custody of the gentleman usher<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The excuse given by the bishop of Durham for signing the protest was as follows: "That this was the greatest misery that ever befel him, and what he did was not with any malicious or treasonable intent; but he going by chance to the archbishop of York's house about two days ago, he sound some bishops there; and the petition signed by many of the bishops, and being desired to subscribe the said petition, he read it over, and took some exceptions to it, but he was drawn to it by inducements, or rather seducements, and he did subscribe it only to preserve his right in voting in parliament; and desiring their lordships to have pity upon him, being a man of great years. — Lords' Journals, vol. iv. p. 498.</NOTE>. Collier says, the bishops' conduct seems fairly desensible; a man ought to fall with dignity and honour, and keep his mind erect, though his fortune happens to be crushed: This was the bi∣shops' case and meaning; they were willing to save their privilege, and support their character; and for making so handsome a retreat, ought to stand commend∣ed upon record. About a fortnight after their commitment they were brought to the bar, to answer and plead to their impeachment; and answered accordingly, Not guilty. They continued without leave of bail till the month of May, and were not afterwards called upon<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">In the arguments of Hutton and Coke against ship-money, 1641, is stated a case, (Mich. 14 Edw. II. 1060) being an action of trespass for breaking his chest, and taking away 70 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> on not guilty, the jury found specially, that the Scots having entered the county of Durham with an army, and making great burning and spoils, the commonalty of Durham met at Durham, of whom the plaintiff was one, and agreed to send some to compound with them to depart, and were all sworn to perform what composition should be made, and to perform what ordonance they should make in that behalf, and thereupon they compounded with the Scots for 1600 marks: And as it was to be paid immediately, they consented that the defendant and others should go into every man's house, to search and take what ready money was there for the making up that sum, and that i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should be repaid by the commonalty of Durham: And thereupon the defendant <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d enter into the plaintiff's house, &amp;c. Judgment was given for the plaintiff; but on a writ of error, was rev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ied in the King's Bench.</NOTE>. Bishop Morton returned to his palace of Durham-house,
<PB N="506" REF="562"/>attending his devotion and studies, being much straitened by the sequestration of his revenues, which took place in consequence of the impeachment, and was not taken off upon his being permitted to go at large. He enjoyed his liberty and re∣tirement till the beginning of the year 1645, but his palatinate suffered much in the civil broils. The Scottish army was put in motion the beginning of January 1643-4, notwithstanding the rigour of the season. The marquis of Newcastle, who com∣manded for the king in the norht, arrived at Newcastle on the 2d of February, with a few troops, not sufficient in number to oppose the invaders in the open field. The Scottish general in vain summoned the town to surrender; and the artillery not coming up to enable him to proceed in a siege, he passed the Tyne on the 28th, at the fords of Ovingham, Bywell, and Altringham, leaving a sufficient force on the north of Newcastle, to keep the garrison in awe. The English skirmished frequent∣ly with the enemy, but without any considerable effect, and at last retired to Dur∣ham, where the marquis received intelligence of the defeat of the royal army com∣manded by Bellasis at Selby; at the same time a detachment of the Scottish army, left to watch his motions at Newcastle, appeared within two miles of Durham, which occasioned him to evacuate that city, and retreat with the utmost expedition towards York.</P>
<P>On the 8th of April 1645, the good old bishop's retirement was broken into, and he was committed to the custody of the serjeant at arms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Commons Journals, vol. iv. p. 10<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>, or (according to others) to the Tower, for refusing to deliver up the seal of his county palatine<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Or rather for having baptized a daughter of the earl of Rutland according to the form in the Common P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ver Book.—Vide Barwick, p. 107.

<P>Barwick's account of this matter is to the following effect: <Q>It was represented “to the house of commons, as a matter of much prejudice to their affairs, that he should have still in his custody the seal of the county palatine of Duresme: The house hereupon sent a committee of their own members to demand it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Commons Journals, vol. iv. p. 529, 549.</NOTE>; and the answer he returned was in the negative; and he desired the interposition of the house of peers (for it was while they sat) for their fuller satisfaction; which they rightly interpreting to be an appeal, from those who were not his competent judges to those that were, sent for him by the sergeant at arms, to appear at their bar; which he did, and made it evident to them, 1st, That it was not a seal transmitted from bishop to bishop successively, but one that had his own arms and impress cut upon it. 2dly, That to part with it could not but be of great prejudice to several persons within the county palatine of Duresme, whose estates depended upon it, both by way of patents for offices and leases for lands. He added also, 3dly, That it might be prejudicial to himself and successors, and to ”the person by whom he received the power to make it.—He was dismissed.</Q> He continued about six months a prisoner, and upon his release withdrew again to Durham-House. When the revenues of his See were wholly taken from him by parliament, on the 10th day of May 1646, they voted him 800 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year for life; a sum much superior to any thing allowed his suffering brethren<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Commons Journals, vol. iii. p. 597.</NOTE>. Whilst he was able to subsist without it, he gave no attention to the order; but when his necessi∣ties grew pressing, and he was urged to look after it, he found the vote totally inef∣fectual, as it was not stated from whence or by whom the allowance was to be paid; and before he could procure an amendment of the order, to make the pension pay∣able out of the revenues of his own bishopric, all the lands and revenues of it were
<PB N="508" REF="564"/>sold, or divided among the harpies which hovered round the parliament-house. By the importunity of some of the bishop's friends, an order was obtained that he should have 1000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> in part, paid out of the treasury at Goldsmiths-hall: With this sum the prelate paid his debts, and purchased an annuity of 200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year for life, upon which he subsisted: This annuity was at first granted by lady Saville in the minority of her son Sir George, and by him confirmed when he came of age. When the sale of bishops lands was resolved upon by both houses of parliament, old Sir Harry Vane came immediately to the bishop of Durham's house, and advised him to petition in time for his livelihood to be granted some other way than by the 800 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year formerly voted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ordered and ordained by the lords and commons, that the yearly sum of eight hundred pounds be continued and paid unto Thomas Morton, D.

Being turned out of Durham-House by the soldiers when they came to garrison it, about the end of the year 1648, the earl and countess of Rutland invited him to Exeter-House in the Strand, where he became a part of their care and family for some short time. But being loth to live at the charge of others while he was able to subsist of himself, and thinking the country air might better suit with his declining years than that of the city, he went and lived with captain Thomas Saunders at Flamstead in Hertfordshire, and afterwards with Tho∣mas Rotheram, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> of Luton, in Bedfordshire. At last, going to London with about sixty pounds, which it seems was then his all, he was overtaken on the road by Sir Christopher Yelverton, who, being known to the bishop, though the bishop was un∣known to him, fell into discourse with him, and asked him who he was? The bishop replied, "I am that old man the bishop of Durham, notwithstanding all your votes;" (for Sir Christopher had too much complied with the times.) Whereupon Sir Chri∣stopher asked whither he was going? "To London," replied the good old bishop, "to live a little while, and then to die." On this Sir Christopher entered into further discourse with him, and took him home to his house at Easton Manduit, in Northamptonshire, where he became tutor to his son, afterwards the very learned Sir Henry Yelverton. On the death of Sir Christopher, his son Sir Henry, who had the affection of a most tender child for the good bishop, continued to support him till his death, which happened on the 22d of September 1659, in the 95th year of his age, the 44th since his being consecrated a bishop, and the 28th of his tran∣slation to the See of Durham.</P>
<P>Whilst we lament the sufferings of the prelate, we must not lose sight of the dis∣tracted changes which took place in the palatinate and See. The halmot court was usurped, and officers were appointed by order of parliament to exercise the duty of

Sir William Bellasis was appointed high-sheriff in the first year of bishop Morton, and continued in that office till his death, which happened on the 3d of De∣cember, 1640. A distringas was issued against his representative, and also against the representative of Timothy Cumin the under-sheriff, to bring in their accounts.

<P>"The humble and harty acknowledgments of many honest people in the county of Durham, declaring as followeth:</P>
<P>"WEE receiving a declaration from his Excellency and you the 26th. of this Instant Aprill; upon the reading whereof, we were at first like men in a dreame,
<PB N="517" REF="573"/>and could hardly beleeve for rejoyceing, to see the wonderfull goodnes and kinde∣ness of God, in renueing a remembrance of your former engagements for this poore nation, whose freedome the Lord hath made you instruments to purchase at so deere a rate, from that slaverie and bondage they were formerly involved in; all which God hath beene wonderfully pleased to crowne, not with ordinary successe, but with almost miraculous discoveryes of his presence with you, to the great satis∣faction of all honest godly harts, and to the conviction of others, forcing them to say for a truth, God is there. We need not mention the particulers, wherein God hath so wonderfully appeared, it being soe obvious to all mens eyes; and this last act is not the least to discover the continuation of the Lords presence with your hearts, in moveing you to desolve this present parliament, whose actions, in these latter dayes, were so contrarie to their own declarations and the armye's engage∣ment, that wee did almost begin to conclude that our oppressions would be as great as ever; and though the sence of our unkindnes to God causes us to con∣clude it is just from him, yet wee thought it very strange from them. And that which did very much add to our sorrow, was the feare of Gods presence with∣drawing from you, which feare was caused by your long silence; but now to see the Lord hath againe quickened you, is as life to our dying expectations, and doth exceedingly engage our hearts, as to acknowledge God in you, soe to continue seeking the Lord for you, that you may not stay nor bee discouraged in the great worke you have in hand, but that you may goe on as instruments to perfect the freedome of the poore people in this nation. And for that end wee doe earnestly beseech the Lord, that you may be kept low in yourselves, and that neither your former glorious victories and successes, nor the eminent imployment that God hath now put you upon, may any way take you off from a singular looking upon God in it, nor any oppositions (which we feare may be many) may discourage you in the prosecution of what is begun, but that you may still goe on in the worke, as God's worke; and be confident it is honesty God will owne, and make honour∣able in these dayes. And although your extraordinary attempts, which necessity put you upon, to make good your engagements to God and this poore nation, may seeme strange to some, yet to those who follow the footstepps of Providence with you, and have been often at the Throne of Grace for you, cannot but ac∣knowledge it as a great mercy from God, causeing you to act for our freedom, through such great difficulties.</P>
<P>Wee make bold, in the behalfe of many hundred honest hearts in this coun∣ty, being desired by many of them to write to you, to let you know how much wee desire to blesse God for still owneing you, and to shew you how much our hearts owne you in this action of late, and with all to desire the Lord to give us hearts that we may be earnest with him, that he may always be wisedom and strength for you, in directing you in the way for a new representative, that may settle this poore nation in its proper rights and freedoms, which hath been long expected. And were it not troublesome and tedious to present some overtures, we should make bold to speake something for this poore county, which hath for a long time layd under many oppressions; and the more, for that by the asurpation
<PB N="518" REF="574"/>and pride of the bishopps, there was never that liberty given us for the choyce of parliament men, to speake out our grievances, or to attempt our deliverance, suta∣ble to all other countyes in the nation, and which allmost all counties had (this excepted;) but we cannot doubt of the enjoyment of that privilege for the future, it being soe fully expressed in your declarations. Therefore we only take liberty humbly to present our conditions, which is not only sadd, but singular; begging of God to minde us in appearing with you, we take leave to subscribe our selves,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>My Lord, and honourable Councell; Your humble servants, under that engagement that requires our lives, and all that is ours to stand by you. Signed by us upon the request, and in the behalfe of many.

<P>"WHEN the Roman commonwealth was almost ruined by a succession of civil wars, it pleased Divine Providence to raise up Octavius Caesar as a happy mean to put a period to those destructive factions, and begin its peaceful and flourishing state. A glorious instrument in Gods hand of the like effects in this common∣wealth was your Highness renowned father, who as well deserved the sirname of Augustus as the former: For who more increased with admirable internal endow∣ments
<PB N="529" REF="585"/>and external honors? or who more succesful to make up the ruines, and increase the well being of a broken state than HE? In whom the warlike prowess of our Fift Henry, and the prudence of our Seventh Henry, and the piety of our Sixt Edward were happily conjoin'd, on whom was fulsill'd the ancient wish of the Romans at the inauguration of their emperors, <HI>Sis Augusto foelicior, sis Trajano m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lior.</HI> As soon as, by the good hand of God following him with unparallel'd suc∣cess, he had laid the storm of our civil wars, he presently set his heart to endea∣vour the repairing of these decayes which arms had made on learning; and this he did by affording all countenance and encouragement to our two famous univer∣sities. Also (considering that these northern counties, as they are too remote from the lightsome, warm and cherishing influences of the sun; so are they from those fountains of light, for the better propagating of learning &amp; religion in them) h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> set his heart on a design of erecting a college in this city of Durham; which with mature advice of his council, he effected by patent under his great seal, sound∣ing a college here, &amp; endowing it with such a proportion of revenue as at the pre∣sent he could conveniently dispose of to such a use, and such privileges as were needful to such a society. The public concernment of the work, together with his Highness zeal and resolution for the effectual carrying it on, encouraged us, who were nominated thereto, to undertake the same; though we well knew what censures we were like to meet with, &amp; what opposition &amp; discouraging difficultys, works of this kind at the first beginning use to be encountred with. Scarcely were we set down there, but it pleased the wise God to remove his Highness from an earthly sceptre to an heavenly crown &amp; glory: Whereon this new erection was left an orphan scarce bound up in its swaddling cloaths; but the Lord having placed your Highness in your father's seat, as supreme magistrate of this common∣wealth, for the continuance of that happy peace and liberty, which under God, owes itself to that admirable valor, wisdom, and success which was in him; we do humbly, with much confidence, promise to ourselves, that your Highness will rea∣dily both cherish and promote that work, which out of his desire of the good of these parts, your excellent father gave a laudable beginning to: That so that col∣lege may remain as a monument of his love of learning no less perpetual, than those many trophies of his victorious military abilities. We, with all the pious and peaceful members of this commonwealth, do bless our gracious God, for his providing for the continuance of our peace and liberties, by setting your Highness in your father's throne, &amp; do say with Haram in the case of Solomon, <HI>Blest be the Lord this day, which hath given our late renowned protector a wise son over this great people, and because the Lord loved his people, hath he done this thing;</HI> beseech∣ing the Father of Mercies to make your Highness as heir to all your fathers matchless abilities for war and government, so of his love, zeal and resolution to promote this work which he began in this place; that by the vital beams of your piteous aspect, it may be cherished and grow, 'till it bear much fruit, for the good &amp; happiness of these parts in the land, in which it was planted by a hand which never miscarried in any of its high and magnanimous atchievements; So pray</P>

<P>Bishop Morton is described to have been low in stature, clean-limbed, of a strong body, excellent constitution, constant and uninterrupted health, and of a comely and affable countenance. Even in his old-age, his carriage was upright, his actions sprightly, his hearing quick, his voice clear, his body firm and full of moisture, so that no physician in the world would have believed him near the age he was, if, in considering his person, he had not regarded the remarkable whiteness of his hair. He was of a quick wit, solid judgment, and retentive memory: As he was a man
<PB N="531" REF="587"/>of great erudition, so was he also extremely studious and diligent, and was never idle without being unhappy: He was often at his devotion and study before four in the morning, even when above eighty years of age, seldom went to bed till af∣ter ten, and then had a servant to read to him till he wished for repose; he had also one to read to him in his coach as he travelled, so anxious was he that his mind should not lose a moment's instruction. Of his moral qualifications the account is equally favourable: He was a man of exemplary piety, temperance, sobriety, and great hospitality. Dr Barwick says, "his conversation was such, for piety and de∣votion, as well became a Christian and a bishop." He never would endure a soft bed, but laid upon a straw mattrass, even when above fourscore, till his in∣firmities obliged him to change it: His study gown was sometimes of a coarse, black, hairy rug; and he seldom exceeded one meal a day, which was supper in his middle age, and dinner in the decline of life: Wine or strong drink he seldom ever tasted; for his health being good, and his bodily infirmities trivial, abstemiousness contributed much to the protection of his constitution: He was never married, yet lived an irreproachable life, even in youth; and, full of good works, piety, virtue, dignity of manners, and full of days, he met his approaching dissolution with religi∣ous peace and holy faith. He was buried the 29th of September, in the chancel of the church of East-Manduit, Northamptonshire, where a monument was after∣wards erected to his memory, with an epitaph<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>In memoriâ sacrâ</L>

<P>After a series of twenty years of the most dreadful anarchy and confusion, and twelve years total subversion of the constitution, the face of England was entire∣ly changed by the restoration of Charles II. People of all ranks were so harassed with the sufferings and distractions they had witnessed, that on the alteration there was a general rejoicing; the state was restored to its former order; and the church re-established in its dignities and offices. This palatinate remained several months without its prelate and governor after the king was restored; for it was not till the 2 <ABBR>d</ABBR> of November, 1660, that JOHN COSIN, S.T.P. dean of Peterborough, was elected to the bishopric: He was consecrated on the 2 <ABBR>d</ABBR> of December, enthroned by proxy on the 8th, and received restitution of the temporalties on the 14th of the same month.</P>
<P>Bishop Cosin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sanderost's Col. Curiosa, vol. ii. p. 19.</NOTE> was the eldest son of Giles Cosin, a citizen of Norwich, by Eli∣zabeth his wife, daughter of—Rennington, of Rennington-castle, a good and ancient family. He was born at Norwich on the 30th of November, 1595<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Biog. Brit. vol. iii. p. 1424.</NOTE>; and educated at the free-school there till he attained the age of fourteen.

<PB N="533" REF="590"/>In 1610 he was sent to Caius college, Cambridge; where he was successively chosen scholar and fellow, and regularly took his degrees in arts: Having distinguished himself by his learning, diligence, and sine parts, in the year 1616, at about the age of twenty, he had offers at the same time both from Dr Lancelot Andrews then bishop of Ely, and from Dr Overall bishop of Litchsield, of a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By keeping this library, he began to learn, "quanta pars eruditionis erat bonos nosce auctores," (which was the saying of Joseph Scaliger) in the knowledge of which he would instruct him.</NOTE> librarian's place; and by his late tutor's advice, accepted the interest of the latter, who liked him so well, that, on account of his knowledge and fair writing, he made him al∣so his secretary, and committed to him the care of his episcopal seal: At the same time he encouraged him to study divinity, and sent him from time to time to keep his exercises in the university: But in 1619 he lost his excellent patron, and with him all the hopes he had entertained of advancement. Providence soon supplied the loss, and gave him a more munificent friend in Dr Richard Neile, then bishop of Durham, who took him for his domestic chaplain, and in 1624 appointed him to the tenth prebend in the cathedral there, into which he was installed the 4th of December in that year. All the time he enjoyed this prebend, which was about six and thirty years, he was constant in his residence, and kept an hospitality con∣sistent with the statutes of that church; so that Dr Basire asserts, upon search of the register of that cathedral, he could not find one dispensation for him in all the time he continued a prebendary. He was very attentive to the rights, privileges, and antiquities of the church, compared the repertorium with the original records, and marked what were wanting. In September, 1624, he was collated to the archdeaconry of the East-Riding in the church of York, vacant by the resignation of Marmaduke Blakeston, whose daughter he had married; and on the 20th of July, 1626, was collated by the bishop of Durham to the rectory of Brancepeth in that diocess, where he first displayed his abundant taste for ornament and elegance, by beautifying that church in an extraordinary manner: The same year he took his degree of bachelor in divinity. About that time, having frequent meetings at the bishop of Durham's house in London with Dr William Laud then bishop of Bath and Wells, Dr Francis White soon after bishop of Carlisle, Dr Richard Mon∣tague, and other learned men, distinguished by their zeal for the doctrine and discipline of the church of England, he began to be obnoxious to the puritans, who in the heat of spirit regarded divines of Mr Cosin's cast as being affected to the Romish church. A book he published in 1627, entitled 'a Collection of Private Devotions,' met with their particular censure. Dr Smith says, <Q>It was “written at the command of Charles l. who thought it expedient this manual of prayers should be composed to take place of such books as he discovered ”were much in the hands of the queen's attendants.</Q> The title page sets forth, that <Q>It was formed upon the model of a book of private prayers authorised “”by queen Elizabeth in the year 1560<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The top of the frontispiece had the name of Jesus in three capital letters I.

This book was severely animadverted upon by Henry Burton, in his 'Examination of Private Devotions, or The Hours of Prayer, &amp;c.' and by W. Prynne, in his 'Brief Survey and Censure of Mr Cosin's cozening Devo∣tions, &amp;c.'</NOTE>.</Q></P>

<P>In 1628 he was concerned, with other members of the church of Durham, in a prosecution against Peter Smart, a prebendary there, for a seditious sermon preach∣ed in that cathedral<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smart, who had been a schoolmaster at Durham, was collated 30th Dec. 1609, to the sixth prebend in the church of Durham, and removed the 6th of July, 1614, to the fourth prebend; he had also other pre∣ferments. Being to preach the 7th of July, 1628, in the cathedral at Durham, he took for his text Psalm xxxi. 7. <HI>I hate them that hold of superstitious vanities.</HI> From which he took occasion to make a most bitter invective against some of the bishops, charging them with no less than popery and idolatry. Among other virulent expressions, he had these: <Q>The whore of Babylon's bastardly brood, doating upon their mother's “beauty, that painted harlot of the church of Rome, have laboured to restore her all her robes and jewels again, especially her looking-glass the mass, in which she may behold her bravery. The mass coming in, brings with it an inundation of ceremonies, crosses and crucifixes, chalices and images, copes and candle∣sticks, tapers and basons, and a thousand such trinkets, which we have seen in this church since the communion table was turned into an altar. I assure you the altar is an idol, a damnable idol as it is used. I say they are whores and whoremongers; they commit spiritual fornication who bow their bodies before ”that idol, the altar, &amp;c.</Q> For this sermon, he was questioned first at Durham, afterwards in the high commissioned court at London, from whence he was removed at his own desire to that at York, where re∣fusing with great scorn to recant, he was for his obstinacy degraded, and, by sentence at common law, soon after dispossessed of his prebend and livings; whereupon he was supplied with 400 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year by subscription from the puritan party, which was more than all his preferments amounted to.—As for Dr Cosin, he was so far from being Mr Smart's chief prosecutor, as he averred, that after he was questioned in the high commis∣sioned court, he never meddled in the matter, save that once he wrote a letter to the archbishop of York and the commissioners in his favour.—Mr Smart's character is not represented to any great advantage. One author indeed (Fuller) calls him "a man of grave aspect and reverend presence;" but Cosin, who knew him better, says, "That he was an old man, of a most froward, fierce, and unpeaceable spirit." He had not preached in the cathedral church of Durham, though prebendary of it, for seven years, till he preached that seditious sermon for which he was questioned. And whilst he held and enjoyed his preferment, and his health too, he seldom preached more than once or twice a year.—Biog. Brit. p. 1475.</NOTE>: About the same time he took the degree of doctor in divi∣nity; and on the 8th of February, 1634, was elected master of Peter-house, in the room of Dr Matthew Wren, newly made bishop of Hereford, in which station he applied himself earnestly to the promotion of learning and religion. He served the office of vice-chancellor for the university of Cambridge, in 1640; and the same year, Charles I, to whom he was chaplain, conferred upon him the deanry of Pe∣terborough, in which he was installed on the 7th of November: But he did not long enjoy that dignity; for, on the 10th of the same month, a petition from Smart was read in the house of commons, wherein he complained of the doctor's supersti∣tion in innovations in the church at Durham, and of his severe prosecution in the high commission court; whereupon, on the 21st of the same month, Dr Cosin was ordered to be sent for by the serjeant at arms, and a committee was appointed to prepare a charge against him. Soon after, he presented a petition to the house, which, on the 28th following, was read and referred to a committee. On the 3d of December the serjeant had leave given him by the commons to take bail for Dr Cosin, which was accordingly done, on the 19th of January, 1640-1, the doctor himself being bound in 2000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and his sureties in 1000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> each, for his appearance upon summons. On the 22d of January he was, by a vote of the whole house, sequestered from his ecclesiastical benefices; being the first example of that kind among the clergy. Rapin says, <Q>Matthew Wren, bishop of Norwich, and after∣wards “of Ely, the bishop of Bath and Wells, and Cosin prebendary of Durham, were all of the same principles, and seconded bishop Laud in using all industry and credit to humble the puritan party; that is, not only the Presbyterians, but ”also the Calvinists, and such who would not patiently bear the yoke of servitude.</Q> On the 15th of March, the commons sent up one-and-twenty articles of impeach∣ment
<PB N="535" REF="592"/>against him to the house of lords: As they relate chiefly to the ceremonies of the church at Durham, they will be fully inserted in that part of this work<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This great man seems to have been assaulted from all the batteries of the republican party. As it hap∣pened, they had picked out an object of their spite, against whom no accusation would suck. They shew∣ed that they would take the shortest way with the church; that they would attack her in her strongest for∣tresses, and defeat her of any support. For if the brightest and most unexceptionable men of her body could not escape their loudest clamours and severest treatment, where should the rest of less merit and greater im∣perfections appear?—They might with as good a face have made Dr Cosin a mahometan as a papist. Against popery was the cry of all those who were endeavouring to make way for it; for there was none so effectual a method, as to reduce the nation to no religion at all. It is not enough to say, in reformation there are no bounds, no end. That giving up one point is but making way to demand another, &amp;c.— Lives of the Engl. Bishops, London, 1733.
<P>Fuller's account of this matter of Smart's, lib. xi. p. 173, is to the following effect:</P>
<P>"Hereupon he was kept prisoner four months by the high commission of York, before any articles were exhibited against him, and five months before any proctor was allowed him. Hence was he carried to the high commission at Lambeth; and after long trouble, remanded to York, fined 500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> committed to prison, ordered to recant; and for neglect thereof, fined again, excommunicated, degraded, and deprived; his da∣mage amounting to many thousand pounds.</P>
<P>"But now Mr Rouse of the house of commons, bringing up the charge to the lords against Dr Cosin, termed Mr Smart the <HI>protomartyr of England in these latter days of persecution;</HI> and large reparations were allowed unto him, though he lived not long after to e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oy them.</P>
<P>"Now, though none can excuse and defend Dr Cosin his carriage herein, yet this must be reported to his due commendation: Some years after, getting over into France he neither joined with the church of French protestants at Charentoun nigh Paris, nor kept any communion with the papists therein, but confiled him∣self to the church of old English protestants, &amp;c. &amp;c."</P></NOTE>. The doctor put in an answer, upon oath, to the several allegations, and so fully vindi∣cated himself, during the five days the affair was depending before the lords, that most of them acknowledged his innocence; and Mr Glover, one of Smart's coun∣sel, told him openly, at the bar of the house of lords, "that he was ashamed of him, and could not in conscience plead for him any longer<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It was supposed there was a settled design to introduce popery, and that several bishops and other clergymen were in the plot. The archbishop of Cantarbury, the bishops of Ely and of Bath and Wells, Dr Cosin, secretary Windebank, and some other, were accused of being chiefly concerned in this affair, which was openly said to be managed by the queen and her considants. Though this charge was perhaps carried too far with respect to the private persons, it can hardly be denied that they gave some cause for it by their proceedings. Their hatred to the presbyterians made them not scruple to make too near ap∣proaches to popery, in order to be at a greater distance from presbyterianism. This, if I am not mis∣taken, was the true cause of all the innovations introduced into the public worship, and of the inviolable attachment to the observance of certain indifferent or needless customs and ceremonies.—Rapin, p. 364.</NOTE>;" on which the lords dismissed the doctor, upon his putting in bail for his appearance; but they never sent for him again. About the same time, upon a motion made in the house of commons, "That he had enticed a young scholar to popery," he was committed to the serjeant at arms, to attend daily till the house should call him to a hearing: After fifty days imprisonment, and charges of twenty shillings a day, he came at length to a hearing; when he made it appear, that, being vice-chancellor of Cam∣bridge, he had most severely punished that young scholar, (whom upon examination he had found guilty) by making him recant, and expelling him the university; to which several of the members bore witness: However, the doctor had no manner of reparation made him for his great trouble and expence, a circumstance which conveys no favourable idea of the justice and honesty of that house. In 1642 he was concerned, with others, in sending the plate of Cambridge university to Cha. J, then at York, for which a furious storm fell upon several members of the univer∣sity,
<PB N="536" REF="593"/>and particularly upon Dr Cosin, who having been some time before voted un∣worthy to be a head or governor of either of the universities, or to hold or enjoy any ecclesiastical promotion, was ejected from his mastership by a warrant from the earl of Manchester, dated the 16th of March 1642-3; so that, as he was the first that was sequestered, so was he also the first of his university that was turned out. Thus, being deprived of all his preferments, and still fearing the worst that might fol∣low, he thought fit to leave the kingdom and withdrew to Paris, in the year 1643: Being safely arrived there, according to king Charles's order and direction, he took under his care, and officiated as chaplain to such of queen Henrietta-Maria's house∣hold as were Protestants; with them, and other English exiles that were daily resort∣ing to Paris, he formed a congregation, that assembled at first in a private house, and afterwards in the chapel of Sir Richard Brown, ambassador from the court of England to that of France. Not long after he had lodgings assigned him in the Louvre, with a small pension, on account of the relation he bore to queen Henri∣etta. During his residence in this place, he shewed how false and groundless the imputation was that had been thrown upon him, of being inclined to the Romish church; for, notwithstanding the difficulties of his situation, he remained steady and unmoved in the profession of his religion; he kept up the English church disci∣pline, and the form of worship appointed by the Common-prayer; he reclaimed se∣veral that were wavering in their principles, and had many controversies and dis∣putes with the ecclesiastics of the country, particularly with the prior of the English Benedictines in Paris, in which he acquitted himself with so much learning and sound reasoning, that he utterly defeated the suspicions of his enemies, and much exceed∣ed the expectations of his friends. "Great offers of preferment were made him," Nelson says<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 519.</NOTE>, "if he could have been tempted to have swerved in his religion." He composed, during his exile, many learned works, which Dr Basire particularly mentions. Though he was extremely zealous for the doctrine and discipline of the church of England, yet he continued a friendly intercourse and correspondence with the Protestant ministers at Charenton, who on their parts expressed the utmost re∣gard for him; and permitted him sometimes to officiate in their congregations, ac∣cording to the rites prescribed by the book of Common-prayer. Thus having, during his seventeen years exile in France, behaved discreetly and prudently, even in the judgment of his enemies, he returned to his native country at the restoration of Charles II, and again took possession of his preferments and dignities. About the end of July 1660, he came to his deanry at Peterborough, and was the first that read the Common-prayer in that cathedral after the times of confusion. But here he was not suffered to rest; for the king designed, a very little while after, to make him dean of Durham; but, reflecting on his sufferings, and his constant at∣tendance and services beyond the seas, he nominated him bishop of that rich See: Accordingly he was consecrated on the 2d of December, 1660, in Westminster abbey. As soon as he had taken possession of his diocese, he set about reforming many abuses that had crept in during the late anarchy, and by his generous and hospitable temper, accompanied with a kind and courteous deportment, he gained an universal respect and esteem. He was appointed by the convocation to draw up a new book of canons.</P>
<P>Charles II. had a design of honouring several of the gentlemen of this diocese,
<PB N="537" REF="594"/>among others, with a new knighthood, which he intended to establish in comme∣moration of his miraculous preservation, called Knights of the Royal Oak, for which a return was made of sit persons with their qualifications, as in the notes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A list of persons names, who were fit and qualified to be made knights of the royal oak; with the value of their estates A.

He chiefly distinguished himself by his great munisicence and charity, and by his pub∣lic spirit; for, considering himself principally as steward of the large revenues belonging to his See, he laid out a great share of them in repairing and rebuilding the several edifices belonging to the bishopric, which were either demolished or
<PB N="538" REF="595"/>neglected during the civil wars. He repaired the castle at Bishop-Auckland, which upon the eizure of bihops lands was betowed upon Sir Arthur Hafilrigge, who, designing to make it his principal seat, and not liking the the old-fashioned building, resolved to crect a new and beautiful fabric, all of one pile, according to the most elegant fashion of those times. To prepare materials for executing this design, he pulled down the spacious and magnisicent chapel built by bishop Beke in the time of Edward I, and proceeded to erect his new palace in a large court on the east side of the old castle: Bishop Cosin, soon after his consecration, remarking that great part of the materials used in that building were taken from the old consecrated edifice, not only refused to use it as his habitation, though it was commodiously contrived and nobly built, but took it wholly down, and with the stone thereof built the beautiful chapel which at present stands near the palace. Under the mid∣dle aile he constructed a convenient vault for his own sepulture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dugd. p. 82.</NOTE>. He enlarged the castle at Durham with several additional buildings, and put the whole into com∣pleat repair. He restored the bishop's house at Darlington, which was then very ruinous: He also enriched his new chapel at Auckland, and that in the castle of Durham, with several pieces of gilt plate, books, and other costly ornaments, to remain to his successors in the bishopric for ever; all which expenditures amounted to no less a sum than 26,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> He likewise built and endowed two hospitals, the one at Durham, for eight poor people, on an old foundation of bishop Langley's; and another at Auckland for four people. He rebuilt the schools, as wings to the edi∣fice for the Durham hospital. He also built a library adjoining to the Exchequer on the Place Green, with an entrance from the private gardens of the palace; this structure, and the pictures with which it is ornamented, cost 800 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and the books he gave thereto 2,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and added an annual pension of 20 marks for ever for a librarian. The college of dissolved prebends at Auckland, purchased by Sir Arthur Hafilrigge, and by him forfeited to the king, which Charles II. gave to bishop Consin, in fee, he gave to his successors bishops of Durham for ever; the yearly value thereof being 320 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> He rebuilt the east end of the chapel at Peter-house in Cambridge, which cost 320 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and gave in books to the library 1000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> He founded eight scholarships in the same university, viz. five in Peter-house of ten pounds a year each, and three in Gonvil and Caius college of teenty nobles a-piece per annum; both which, together with a provision of eight pounds yearly to the common chest of the two colleges respectively, amounted to 2500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> He likewise made an augmentation of 16 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year to the vicarage of St Andrew's, at Auckland. He gave to the cathedral church a carved lectern and litany desk, with a large scol∣loped silver patin, gilt, for the use of the communicants there, which cost 45 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> Upon the new buildings of the bishop's court, exchequer, and chancery, and towards erecting two sessions houses at Durham, he gave 1000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR>; towards the redemption of Christian slaves at Algiers, 500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR>; for the relief of the distressed loyal party in England, 800 <ABBR>l.</ABBR>; for repairing the banks in Howdenshire, 100 marks; and towards the repairs of St Paul's cathedral in London, 50 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> The rest of his benefactions will be shewn in his will. In a word, this generous bishop, during the eleven years he
<PB N="539" REF="596"/>sat in the See of Durham, is said to have spent above 2000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year in pious and charitable uses. The lease of the manors of Gateshead and Whickham for 99 years, granted by bishop Barnes to queen Elizabeth, being near expiring, he granted a concurrent lease thereof, to his son-in-law Sir Gilbert Gerrard, for 21 years, which the dean and chapter refusing to consirm, they were summoned to attend the king and council; and the king asking dean Sudbury, if it was against his conscience to confirm this lease, he answered "No; but —" and was going to give hi; reasons against it: The king replied, "If it is not against your conscience, I will have no <HI>buts,</HI> so go home and confirm it;" which was done accordingly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gray's MSS.</NOTE>. At the time bishop Cosin was appointed to the See of Durham, most of the church leases were expired; so that he received, for fines on renewals, a sum not less than 20,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> as he admits by his will. The fines raised on the lands belonging to the See of Durham, at that time, amounted to one million and a half of money<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In this prelate's time, a statute was made, (12th Cha. II.) whereby the court of wards and liveries, tenures <HI>in capite,</HI> and by knights service and purveyance, were all taken away. The preamble of the act set forth, <Q>That they and the conse∣quents “upon the same have been much more burthensome, grievous, and prejudi∣cial to the kingdom, than beneficial to the king." And it was thereby declared, That all lands should be thenceforth discharged of tenures by homage, escuage, voyages royal, and all charges for the same, wardships incident to tenure by knights service, and values and forfeitures of marriage, <HI>aide pour fille marrier,</HI> and ”<HI>aide pour faire fitz chivalier.</HI></Q> Such dignities as the statute of Henry VIII. left to this palatinate, suffered great diminution by this act; though infinite blessings flowed to the subjects, by relieving them from the dregs of the old Norman slavery, and that weaker badge of servility created by Henry VIII. in the 32d and 33d years of his reign, when the court of wards was established; now, under the auspices of an enlightened and beneficent age, all the ancient tenures, so oppressive to the subject, were turned into free and common soccage, except tenures in <HI>frankalmoin,</HI> to piou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> uses; by copy of court rolls, or grand serjeantry, on personal services to the king. As this change made a considerable alteration in the bishop's revenues, and the king had received a compensation by several duties granted him, the bishop petitioned to have a remittance of the yearly sum of 880 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> remaining a charge upon his palatinate, part of the sum of 1000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> originally imposed by queen Elizabeth, towards the sup∣port of her military establishments at Berwick; which was accordingly granted.</P>
<P>In the year 1666 began a contest between the bishop and the people of his pala∣tinate, concerning their right to representatives in parliament: In Cromwell's time they were admitted to that privilege, and were not willing now to relinquish it. The grand jury<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The grand jury was composed of the following gentlemen, viz.

<PB N="540" REF="597"/>the behalf of all the freeholders of the said county, setting forth, "That they do not enjoy the privilege of sending members to parliament, as all the other counties of the kingdom do.</P>
<P>Being confident, that the justices of the peace will be pleased to join with and assist them by all lawful ways and means, in their endeavours to right their injured country, hoping the justices will take the premisses into serious consideration, and nominate and send up to London, with all convenient speed, such persons as they shall think fit, for the effectual prosecution of this great concernment of the country, that they may petition the parliament to grant this just and reasonable request, that they may have knights and burgesses to represent them in parliament, like all other counties in the kingdom.</P>
<P>Which petition being read in open court, the right rev.

<P>After this, the freeholders published their reasons, wherefore knights and bur∣gesses were desired for the county palatine of Durham.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>"1. All the counties and counties palatine within the kingdom of England have knights and burgesses to represent them in the commons house of parliament, save only the county palatine of Durham.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The county palatine of Chester (which is a county palatine by prescription) have their knights and burgesses by an act of parliament made in the 34th year of the reign of king Henry VIII.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The freeholders and inhabitants within the county palatine of Durham, are subject and liable at this day to all aids and subsidies granted by any act of parlia∣ment, in the same degree as the freeholders and inhabitants of any other county are.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The prejudice which the freeholders and inhabitants in the said county pala∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine of Durham may suffer for want of representatives in their trade, and in the pro∣portioning of aids by general laws and otherwise.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. This doth not in any sort impair the jurisdiction of the county palatine, no more than the act that enabled Chester to fend knights and burgesses did, which re∣mains still as compleat a county palatine as Durham is."</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>To these reasons the bishop gave the following answers in opposition to the coun∣ty having knights and burgesses:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>"1. It has always been held a special privilege belonging to the bishopric and county palatine of Durham, to be exempt from sending any knights or burgesses to sit in parliament for that county.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. All the bishops of Durham at their first entrance and inthronization, take a solemn oath, to desend and preserve all accustomed rights, privileges and immuni∣ties
<PB N="541" REF="598"/>(whereof the aforesaid privilege and exemption is one) appertaining to his bishopric and county palatine, and this oath the bishop is bound to observe, nor doth he yet know any expedient that will free him from it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. If any law should be now made to take away that privilege, it would prove to be a great innovation, and alter the condition and constitution of that bishopric.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The election of knights and burgesses cannot be made in that county without the king's writ; but <HI>breve regis non currit in comitatu palatino Dunelmensi,</HI> which is the usual return that the bishop of Durham maketh to any writ sent unto him, in case any of his liberties and immunities be infringed by it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The city of Durham and all other corporations in that county, hold their char∣ters from the bishop, to the observance of whose privilege<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they are all sworn and bound, not to attempt or act any thing to the contrary.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. This attempt for knights and burgesses was first of all (about 53 years since) projected and made by a few discontented gentlemen; who sought thereby, as they then threatened, to lessen the bishop's power in his courts and jurisdiction over that county palatine: But their attempt prevailed not at that time, nor ever since in any parliaments following to this day. Neither could the king's royal progenitors ever be persuaded to give way to any such new attempt or innovation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. The whole county hath heretofore withstood that innovation when it was first be∣gun, without the consent of the bishop; and in like manner, many of the freehold∣ers and gentlemen there withstand it now; though some others among them, shew themselves vehemently desirous of it; and for the better obtaining of their purpose, have by their agents offered the bishop for the time being, that he shall have the no∣mination of one knight and one burgess, if by consent an act of parliament may be passed for it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. There was never yet any precedent for sending such knights and burgesses out of his bishopric and county palatine, but only in the time of Cromwell the usurper, who violently took away the rights and privileges of it, and gave leave to the dis∣loyal and disaffected party of the county to chuse one knight, and one burgess, af∣ter the murther of the late king.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. The persons who now labour to set up knights and burgesses in this county palatine (and tell the bishop that they hope and expect to prevail in it, whether he will give his consent to it or no) have neither any right nor necessity to do it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. For though they pretend to have the same claim and right which all other counties have in this particular, yet the prescription, custom, and practice in this county palatine is against them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>11. And whereas they complain, that divers taxes and royal aids are imposed upon them in parliament without their consent, having no knights and burgesses there to sit and vote for them, yet this imposition, is no other than hath been al∣ways heretofore used; nor hath any exception till now of late, been taken against it, neither herein do they suffer any injury or inconvenience, having had special care taken of them in all times by the bishops of Durham concerning the propor∣tion of their taxes, whereof (being equally rated with other counties) they have no reason to complain; and having received the benefit of all other laws made for the
<PB N="542" REF="599"/>kingdom, and in particular the late law of freeing them from wardships, when they had no knights and burgesses of their own to speak for them in it, or to give consent thereunto, as all the rest of the kingdom had. Add hereunto, for further answer to that objection and complaint, that divers such taxes and impositions are laid up∣on the clergy in that bishopric and county palatine, who have no representatives ad∣mitted to consent and vote for them in parliament, but only their own bishop of Durham.</ITEM>
<ITEM>12. But the bishop of Durham in declining to give his assent unto the present desires of some gentlemen in this county palatine, who endeavour to make them∣selves knights and burgesses after the example of the county palatine of Chester, (which is a cafe far different from this of Durham) is tender herein of the good and welfare of the county, in saving them much trouble, expences and charges, which might otherwise be brought upon them, and careful to preserve the ancient consti∣tution and custom of his bishopric and county palatine, which he and his predeces∣sors have held by prescription for many ages; being well assured, that the people and inhabitants within this county palatine do receive a great benefit, ease and quietness by the immunities and privileges which they continually enjoy there un∣der the bishop of Durham; of which privileges and immunities, this is, and ever hath been one, to be exempt from sending any knights or burgesses to parliament.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>JOHN DURESME."</P>
<P>Afterwards, the bishop gave the following further answers to the freeholders:</P>
<P N="1">"1. All the counties of England send knights and burgesses to the parliament, but the bishopric and county palatine of Durham sendeth none; for it hath, by an∣cient custom and prescription, an immunity to the contrary, which the bishop of Durham is bound by oath to preserve: Nor is there any convincing reason to be given why it should in this particular be like to other counties; or that the ancient exemption and privilege of it should now be altered or taken away, to satisfy the desires of some gentlemen and freeholders in that county, where there are a great many other considerable persons who desire no such alteration; humbly conceiving, that the honour and justice of a parliament will never suffer any such bill to pass against the bishop's accustomed right in that county palatine, confirmed by all his majesty's royal progenitors.</P>
<P>The county of Durham never yet had any knight or burgess, save only one of each sort elected for the shire and city there by order from Cromwell the late usur∣per, after he and his pretended parliament had murdered the king's royal father of blessed memory, and taken away both the bishopric and all the rights of that county palatine, which by the public laws and constitutions of the kingdom, with all the rights and ancient customs thereunto belonging, have since reverted to the bishop.</P>
<P>Those late and new representatives (as they then called them) were Lilburn and Smith, chosen by a disaffected and disloyal part of the country, the rest (far more considerable than that party was) not consenting to them, nor acknowledging them∣selves to be represented by them, no more than they or any other of this kingdom of England were represented by the knights and burgesses which Cromwell called from Scotland and Ireland to sit with them in his illegal parliament: Other exam∣ple
<PB N="543" REF="600"/>than this alone cannot be produced by any of the gentlemen or freeholders in the county palatine of Durham, for the violation and disturbance of the ancient right and exemption there, in this particular.</P>
<P N="2">2. This peculiar instance of granting knights and burgesses to the county palatine of Chester, is not of force enough to infer, that therefore the like grant ought to be made unto the county palatine of Durham.</P>
<P>Because there is no such necessity now to have knights and burgesses in the county palatine of Durham, as there was in the county palatine of Chester, which in the 34th year of Henry VIII. had been about 280 years before, taken into the crown by Henry III. who gave other lands in exchange for it, to the aunts and next co∣heirs of John Scot, the last earl and count palatine of Chester, of the blood of Hugh Lupus (to whom William the Conqueror first gave that palatine jurisdiction); to which seisure, that king was induced, as the record saith, <HI>ne tanta hoereditas in∣ter colos diduceretur.</HI> Whereupon the county palatine of Chester suffered many in∣conveniencies.</P>
<P>And notwithstanding the grants which were sometimes made thereof to the per∣son of the king's eldest son, yet upon his death, it descended not upon his heirs, but returned again to the crown.</P>
<P>And after Wales had been totally subdued by king Edward II, the kings of Eng∣land when they created their eldest son earl of Chestor, they created him also prince of Wales; which in the 27th of Henry VIII, being by act of parliament annexed to England, had some knights and burgesses appointed for them to sit in the great council of the realm.</P>
<P>And hereupon the inhabitants within the county palatine of Chester, took occa∣sion seven years after, to petition the king and parliament for knights and burgesses of their own, lest otherwise their liberties should be infringed by their neighbours of Wales.</P>
<P>And 'tis to be noted, that king Henry VIII, from the time of his coming to the crown, to the time of passing that act in the 34th year of his reign, had not been pleased to confer that county palatine of Chester upon his heir apparent, but re∣served it in his own hands.</P>
<P>And therefore in regard of all these reasons, the inhabitants within that county palatine thought it convenient and needful for them to sue for knights and burgesses.</P>
<P>All which reasons belong nothing to the bishopric and county palatine of Dur∣ham that was never yet taken into the crown, but by unjust means in the minority of king Edward VI. at what time nevertheless there was no fuit or appointment made for knights and burgesses to be elected in this county for the parliament.</P>
<P>Because the inhabitants within the county palatine of Chester at the time of passing that act (as appeareth in the preface thereof) had a long while sussered in their bo∣dies, goods, and lands, and in their civil government contrary to law; which can∣not be said of the inhabitants of the county palatine of Durham, under the bishop's government and jurisdiction there.</P>
<P>Because, that very act which introduced knights and burgesses into the county, palatine of Chesser, brought a great innovation upon it in one of the best privileges
<PB N="544" REF="601"/>thereof, by altering the accustomed writs concerning the payment of debts in that county, as appears by the act itself. The loss of which privilege in the county pa∣latine of Durham, would be a great prejudice and inconvenience to the inhabitants thereof: Other innovations arose afterwards upon this occasion in the county pala∣tine of Chester; which therefore is no good example for the bishop or county pa∣latine to follow.</P>
<P N="3">3. True it is; that the freeholders and inhabitants within this county palatine of Durham, are, and ever have been subject to pay, as all the rest of the kingdom doth, all aids and taxes imposed upon them by act of parliament; but it is not true, that because they pay such aids and taxes, therefore they must of necessity have their own peculiar knights and burgesses chosen by themselves to give consent thereunto. For in all times heretofore they have paid the same, and received great benefit by other laws passed in parliament, and lately by the law of taking away wardships when they had no knights and burgesses of their own to sit there.</P>
<P>Nor was this ever counted a grievance, till of late some discontented persons pre∣sumed to take exceptions against it; especially at the sessions of peace held at Dur∣ham in Sept. 1666, where they procured the grand jurymen to complain of it to themselves sitting then upon the bench, (before the bishop, being at that time some miles distant from Durham could come to sit there with them) calling it, as appears by the petition then preferred, "a great dishonour to the country to want knights and burgesses, who should vote with their fellow subjects in parliament, and not stand at the door of that house with a petition, where they ought to sit as judges, and not to pay those aids and taxes, or be subject to those laws which they did not vote or consent to themselves;" adding further, "that the parliament owed them near 26,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> for paying the Scotch army 21 years before;" and supposing, "that this money would be procured for them from the parliament, and that the present aids and taxes would be mitigated, if they had knights and burgesses of their own to sit there, and importune the house of commons for that purpose." This was the substance of their petition and desire at that time, which is still fomented among them by those persons whom they have employed to solicit the parliament for their purpose at the charge of the county; whereupon they will certainly bring a far greater charge, if knights and burgesses should be elected and maintained from time to time with the allowance of their wages due by law: And thus while they pre∣tend to mitigate and lessen the charge of the county, the truth is, they intend to augment it; from which intention and charge the bishop is the more careful to save the county.</P>
<P>There can be no strength in this reason, whereby they would infer the necessity of electing knights and burgesses to consent unto these payments of aids and taxes, unless they will also infer they are not to be paid without their consent, which is injurious to the king and parliament, and contrary to the dutiful and ancient prac∣tice of this county palatine.</P>
<P>The whole clergy of this county have no representatives in the commons house of parliament, and yet they take no exceptions (as these men do) against the pay∣ments imposed upon them by law for aids and taxes to the king; and the bishop's
<PB N="545" REF="602"/>customary tenants and copyholders being by far the greater number of this county, (whom these men would have excluded from having any voice in the election of their new desired knights and burgesses) make the like payments according to their duty; but that all these pay their aids and taxes in this county, contrary to all law and right of subjects, (as the grand jurymen said in their petition for the freeholders) it may be well thought that no other sober men will say.</P>
<P N="4">4. The freeholders of this county palatine suffer no prejudice herein. Nor can any one instance be given of it from the first beginning of this monarchy, that any such prejudice as is here surmised ever yet happened in the county palatine of Durham, more than in any other counties that have knights and burgesses to represent them in parliament.</P>
<P>This reason seems to reflect upon the honour and justice of the parliament, which, notwithstanding this surmise, useth to take care of all persons (generally represented in the name of all the commons of England) that they shall suffer no wrong or prejudice in their public proceedings, and are ready to receive the just complaints and grievances (if any be) that are at any time presented to them; wherein the bishop of Durham (who hath a peculiar interest in the government and welfare of this county palatine) is always present in the house of peers either in per∣son or by proxy, to propose any thing that may conduce to the benefit thereof, and to the redressing of any just grievance in it, which may be brought to his know∣ledge.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is much to be feared, that if these gentlemen might have their desires, the jurisdiction of the county palatine of Durham will be greatly impaired: For those men who first of all about 54 years since began to move and set forward this altera∣tion, (which was then contradicted by the justices, gentlemen, and freeholders of the whole county) made open profession, and said, "that they would humble the bishop and his courts, together with all his clergy, especially those of his cathedral church." Which animosities are still too rife against them among many persons in the country at this day, and may prove to be of very dangerous consequence against both church and state of this kingdom, and against the bishop's prescription and rights of government in this county; which being peculiar to him, if once alter∣ed and diminished, it cannot be said to continue so compleat a county palatine as it was before.</P>
<P>The act for Chester hath impaired that county palatine in three special innova∣tions already; one concerning writs issued out of the exchequer there for debts, as was observed before; another about the awarding of exigents and proclamations contrary to the former privilege and custom of that county palatine; and a third, concerning the nomination of the custos rotulorum. In all which, and the loss of divers other privileges complained of in that county, the bishop and county pala∣tine of Durham never yet would follow them.</P>
<P>But supposing that the county palatine of Chester should have suffered nothing to the prejudice of their rights and privileges there, yet this were no sufficient rea∣son to extort from the bishop of Durham any of his ancient rights and exemptions whether he will or no, as these men now endeavour to do, by procuring an act of
<PB N="546" REF="603"/>parliament to alter the constitution and customs of this county, and to empower them to elect knights and burgesses there without his consent; who, if any writ should be brought unto him for such elections to be made within his jurisdiction, is bound by oath to answer (as in cases of like nature the bishops of Durham have al∣ways done) for the preservation of their ancient customs and liberties in that county palatine, that <HI>breve regis non currit in comitat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> palatino Dunelmensi.</HI>"</P>
<P>The bishop also wrote several letters to Colonel John Tempest and Ralph Davi∣son, esqrs; concerning knights and burgesses in the county of Durham, of which the following was the last and most remarkable:</P>
<LETTER>

<P>"This shall be my answer to your letter of yesterday, wherein I find nothing but a repetition of what you have often said before, without any one new reason added, whereby you might give yourselves any hope to convince or incline me to your own will, in the way that you have taken. You say, that you have made your addresses to me from time to time with all submission, and truly I must con∣fess, that you have other whiles used such words of submission when you came to treat with me, about setting up new knights and burgesses in the bishopric: But by your actions that have followed such your submissive words, it appeareth plain∣ly, that when you spake the words, you never intended to submit to me at all, and have therefore prosecuted such your intentions with all eagerness contrary to my advice. You say you have sought, and endeavoured very often to persuade me that I would yield to your desires; but I have as often endeavoured also to persuade you, that you would yield to mine, which hitherto I believe hath more reason in them than yours. And because you cannot prevail upon me, and bring me to your bent, you profess you are very sorry, as I truly think you are, but I pray let me return upon you your own words, and say, that I am also sorry I cannot pre∣vail upon you to make you give over this eager prosecution of the business, which you have taken in hand, as I suppose, against the general good and quiet of the county, and as you know well, against the consent, both of myself and a conside∣rable party there, and as I know well, against the accustomed rights and privileges of my bishopric. Yet you still pretend and urge the desires of the whole county, whose desires not long since I shewed you to be to the contrary under all their hands, and I trust, you will not deny, but the gentlemen, fogether with the estate and con∣dition of the country, then were as considerable as they are now; nor can you say that any new grievances are risen in the country since that time, or that less care is taken of the county than in your forefathers days, who never sought that innova∣tion or alteration in the wonted constitution of the bishopric which you now do. You have no precedent either for preferring a bill without the bishop's consent, or setting up knights and burgesses for to sit in parliament, but only in Cromwell's time to serve in his parliament, after he had murthered the late excellent king, and destroyed both the bishopric and the county palatine rights annexed to it. To your common plea and plausible argument, which you think will work upon many others: That the country pay taxes, and have no representatives to give consent for

<PB N="549" REF="606"/>
<P>The two last years of his life the bishop enjoyed but a very indifferent state of health, being very much afflicted with the stone. He lost much of his popularity by his contest with the county touching representatives in parliament, and lived in
<PB N="550" REF="607"/>greater retirement after that business. At length, however, the <HI>roaring pains</HI> of his distemper, as he used to call them, together with a pectoral dropsy, put an end to his life, at his house in Pall-Mall, Westminster, on the 15th of January, 1671-2, when he was seventy-seven years of age. In his will, dated the 11th of December,
<PB N="551" REF="608"/>1671, he made a large and open declaration of his faith<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Appendix to Dr Basire's Dead Man's Real Speech, London, 1673. This part of the will is in Latin. Durham, 18th Jan. 1672, ver. cop. ex. per me W.

He gave to the quiremen and choristers of the cathedral, who should attend his funeral, twen∣ty marks; five pounds and a mourning ring to the preacher at his funeral; and to the dean and prebendaries, if attending, a gold ring, inscribed <HI>memorare novissima.</HI> He ordered six pounds to be distributed to the alms people of his two hospitals, who should be present at his obsequies; and twenty pounds to the poor people who on that occasion should come in and ask alms. After recounting the several works he had performed in his life-time, (which are noticed before, in page 538, and in the notes) he proceeds thus: <Q>All which expences, laid out upon the repairing and “rebuilding the bishop's houses aforesaid, and works of piety, I here insert and mention in this my last will and testament, as works of duty belonging unto me, and not out of any ostentation or boasting of it, as well to satisfy the world in general, as my successors the bishops of Durham in particular, that although I received near upon 20,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> for fines of leases, (and truly I received no more, from my first coming to the bishopric in the year 1660 to the end of seven years following, notwithstanding all the vain reports of larger sums received by me for those fines of leases) yet I took no part of those fines to my own private use, or to make provision by them for my children; but laid out the whole sum re∣ceived, and a great deal more, upon the repairs and pious uses before exprest: All which disbursements I hope will acquit me as to my successors, from ”any pretence of dilapidations.</Q> He bequeathed fifty pounds to be distributed among the prisoners for debt in the gaols of Durham, York, Peterborough, Cam∣bridge, and Norwich, ten pounds to each prison; twenty pounds to the poor with∣in
<PB N="552" REF="609"/>in the precincts of the cathedral church of Norwich, and in the parish of St An∣drews, where he was born and brought up in his minority; thirty pounds to the poor of Durham, Auckland, Darlington, Stockton, Gateshead, and Brancepeth, to each place five pounds; ten pounds to the poor of Chester-in-the-Street, Houghton∣le-Spring, Northallerton, Crake, and Howden, being all manors belonging to the bishops of Durham, to each parish forty shillings; to the rebuilding of St Paul's church in London one hundred pounds, to be paid when the edifice is five yards above ground, having before given to the repairs thereof one hundred marks at one time, and fifty pounds at another. He gave forty pounds to the cathedral church at Norwich; one half or more thereof to be bestowed by the dean and chapter there, upon a marble table or monument, to be set up and affixed to the south pil∣lar adjoining to the steps that lead up to the altar, with the inscription therein-mentioned, in memory of bishop John Overall, who lies buried in that place; the remainder to be applied for useful and decent ornaments about the communion table. Towards rebuilding the north and south sides of St Peter's college chapel in Cam∣bridge, he gave two hundred pounds, to compleat it equally with the other sides done by him; fifty pounds towards building a new chapel at Emanuel college; to the children of Mr Hartley, of Norwich, his brother-in-law, one hundred pounds; to his nephew Mr Thomas Skinner, of Hull, fifty pounds; to four of his nephews fifty pounds each, and to a niece one hundred; to the children of Mr John Hay∣ward, prebendary of Litchfield, twenty pounds each, in gratitude to their deceased father, for placing him with bishop Overall. A great number of his books, viz. about one thousand, in several volumes, he had given to the public library of St Peter's college in Cambridge; the rest of his books, according to a catalogue signed by him, by a special deed he gave to public use, in the new library he built upon the Palace-Green in Durham, <HI>for the common benefit of the clergy and others that shall resort thereunto:</HI> The whole collection of all his books having cost him near three thousand pounds, and all the care of above fifty years together. The will then proceeds with several bequests to his family; donations to his successors of Auckland college; with an appointment of sixteen pounds to the curate of St Andrew's, Auckland, in augmentation of his stipend, which will be particular∣ly noticed under that parish in the second volume.</P>
<P>About the year 1625, our prelate married Frances, daughter of Marmaduke Blakeston, M. A. by whom he had several children. His eldest son was prevailed upon not only to desert the church of England, but also to take religious orders in the church of Rome; and though the bishop used all the ways imaginable, and even the authority of the French king, which he had interest to procure, to re∣gain him, yet all proved ineffectual. Nalson says<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 519.</NOTE>, he had heard him aver, that this was the most sensible affliction that ever befel him in his whole life. The ex∣pressions in his will touching this matter, speak his grief: <Q>Item, I give and be∣queath “to Mr John Cosin, my lost son, one hundred pounds, having already settled an annuity of fifty pounds per ann. upon him during his life; and the reason why I give him no more, is, because he hath dealt very undutifully with me his indul∣gent father, and twice forsaken his mother the church of England, and the pro∣testant
<PB N="553" REF="610"/>being the true catholic religion there professed, to my great grief and trou∣ble, having not come to me for better advice, but wholly avoided me during these ”four last years together.</Q> The bishop had four daughters; one married to Sir Gilbert Gerrard, baronet; another to Sir — Burton, baronet; and the youngest to Dr Dennis Granville, brother to the earl of Bath, and afterwards dean of Durham. The bishop's remains were first deposited in a vault in London; and in April, 1672, conveyed to the appointed place of sepulture in the chapel of Auckland, where, on the 29th of that month, they were interred. His funeral sermon was preached by Dr Basire, who says, in a note thereto, <Q>Upon a serious search of the whole line “of bishops of Durham, from the first of Lindisfarne to Cosin, sixty-eight in num∣ber, there are found upon the ecclesiastical records but eight bishops, in 1034 years, that seem to have equalled but not exceeded him in the noble virtues of munificence and beneficence: And it is worth consideration of our age, that ”the valuation of work and materials were far less in those ancient times.</Q> The names of the bishops alluded to in the above quotation are, Aldwinus, Egelri∣cus, Flambard, Pudsey, Beke, Skirlaw, Hatfield, and Tunstall<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bishop Cosin granted a patent of the water-bailiff's place for Sunderland; also made John Tempest, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> his vice-admiral, <HI>qua<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndiu se bene gesserit;</HI> also Mr Richard Matthew, judge of his court of admiralty; and Walter Etterick, register of that court.

<P>During the vacancy, the king appointed Sir Gilbert Gerrard, knight and baronet, high-sheriff, on the 20th of March 1671; and after him Sir James Clavering, ba∣ronet, on the 9th of June 1673.

<P>In Pope's Life of Ward bishop of Salisbury (p. 90) we are told, this See was offer∣ed to him, which he refused "because he did not like the conditions." What those conditions were, our author leaves us in the dark. In Mr Gray's MS. notes is the following relation, that may serve to illustrate the above passage, and which, he remarks, was <HI>ex relatione Rich. I. earl of Scarborough,</HI> A. D. 1715. <Q>After bishop “Crewe had got a promise of the bishopric of Durham, it was long before he could get into possession, though he diligently solicited matters; but still something hindered, which he could not find out, till he applied to lord Lumley: My lord discovered, that the king had promised a sum to be paid Mrs Eleanor Gwyn out of this bishopric, and without agreeing with her, nothing could be done: Whereupon the bishop, by his agent, applied to her, and agreed to pay 5 or 6000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> One Arden was bound with the bishop for the money, and thereupon he got into possession: The money was duly paid, and the bishop made Arden ”his steward.</Q> From Browne Willis's authority it appears, that the duke of Monmouth received the revenues of this bishopric during the vacancy.</P>

<PB N="556" REF="614"/>was admitted commoner of Lincoln college in Oxford, where he took the degree of bachelor of arts, the 1st of February 1655, and soon after was chosen fellow of that college. The 29th of June 1658 he took the degree of master of arts. At the restoration he declared heartily in favour of the crown and hierarchy, and in 1663 was one of the proctors of the university; the year sollowing, on the 2d of July, he took the degree of doctor of law, and soon after went into holy orders. On the 12th of August 1668, he was elected rector of Lincoln college, upon the de∣cease of Dr Paul Hood. On the 29th of April 1669, was installed dean of Chi∣chester, and held with that dignity the precentorship, in which he had been install∣ed the day before; he was also appointed clerk of the closet to king Charles II. In 1671, upon the translation of Dr Blandford to the See of Worcester, he was elected bishop of Oxford in his room, and consecrated the 2d of July, being allow∣ed to hold therewith, <HI>in commendam,</HI> the living of Whitney, and the rectorship of Lincoln college; but the latter he resigned the 10th of October 1672. In 1673, he performed the marriage ceremony of James duke of York with Maria of Este. Through that prince's interest, (with whose measures he seems to have been very compliant) he was translated to the opulent See of Durham. In the begin∣ning of the year 1675 he baptized Katharina Laura, the new-born daughter of James duke of York. The 26th of April, 1676, he was sworn of the privy coun∣cil to Charles II. Upon the accession of James II. to the crown, he was in great favour at court, being thought most obsequious to the will of the sovereign: Ac∣cordingly, on the 29th of December, 1685, he was made dean of his majesty's chapel royal, in the room of Henry bishop of London, who had been removed; and within a few days after, admitted of the privy council.

Immediately aster that bishop's suspension, commissioners were appointed to exercise all manner of ecclesiastical jurisdiction within the diocese of London, of which bishop Crewe was one. The 20th of November following, he was present at, and consenting to the degradation of Mr Samuel Johnson, previous to the severe punishment that was inflicted on that eminent divine. In the quality of an ecclesiastical commis∣sioner, he countenanced with his presence a prosecution carried on in May, 1687, against Dr Peachy, vice-chancellor of Cambridge, for refusing to admit one Alban Francis, a benedictine monk, to the degree of master of arts in that university, without taking the oaths<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Kennet's Compl.

His name was again inserted in a new ecclesiastical commission, issued out this year, wherein he acted during the severe proceedings against Magdalen college in Oxford, for refusing to elect one Anthony Farmer their president, pursuant to the king's mandate. The bishop continued acting as an ecclesiastical commissioner (being stiled the grand inquisitor thereof) till Oct. 1688, when that commission was abolished. Towards the end of the year 1687, he was employed, with the bishops of Rochester and Peterborough, to draw up a form of thanksgiving for the queen's being with child. Thus he constantly complied with the king's de∣signs, and coincided with his humours, till he discovered that the prince of Orange's party was likely to prevail: This induced him to absent himself from the council-board; and as he was servile, so was he abject: He threw himself in the way of the archbishop of Canterbury, to tell him he was sorry for having so long concurred with the court; and begged to be reconciled to his grace and the other bishops<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 527.</NOTE>. He found it was now time to retract, change his countenance, and counterwork his former principles; and in the convocation that met in January, 1688-9, to consider of silling the throne, he was one of those who voted on the 6th of February, that James II. had abdicated the kingdom<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Wood. Ath. Ox.</NOTE>. Notwithstanding all this, his thorough compliance with the late court's arbitrary designs, had rendered him so obnoxious to the nation, that he was excepted by name out of the pardon granted by William and Mary the 23d of May, 1690<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Stat. 2 Win and Mary, see. 1, chap 10.</NOTE>. The bishop was so terrified with this public mark of ignominy, that he absconded for a time, and actually fled beyond sea. Kennet says<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">p. 597.</NOTE>, <Q>That he despaired to any fa∣vour “at the revolution, and was once got beyond sea in a fright; but being brought back by the importunities of a domestic servant, he made fresh interest in the new court and parliament, and bought off the complaints of Mr Samuel ”Johnson and others, who had suffered by him.</Q> Bishop Burnet likewise tells us<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Vol. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. p. 8<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2.</NOTE>, <Q>The poor bishop of Durham, who had absconded for some time, and was “waiting for a ship to get beyond sea, fearing public affronts, and had offered to compound by resigning his bishopric<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">He offered to resign the bishopric to Dr Burnet, and trust to his generosity for the payment of 1000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year, out of it; but he was of too serupulo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a conscience to accept it upon any such terms.</NOTE>, was now prevailed on to come, and by voting the new settlement, to merit at least a pardon for all that he had done; which, all things considered, was thought very indecent in him, yet not ”unbecoming the rest of his life and character.</Q> By what means he effected his purpose, is not easy to determine; but it is certain, he made his peace with the court, and preserved his bishopric: In order to secure himself the possession of that dignity, he was forced to permit the crown to dispose of, or at least to nominate, to his prebends of Durham as they should become vacant<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">Biog. Brit. p. 1521.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>By the death of his two elder brothers in 1691, he became baron Crewe of Stene; and about the 21st of December in the same year, he married, but lest no
<PB N="558" REF="616"/>issue. During the rest of king William's reign, he remained quiet and unmolest∣ed, though not much considered. In 1710 he was one of the lords that opposed the prosecution then carried on against Dr Sacheverell, declared him not guilty, and protested against several steps taken in that affair.</P>
<P>In the latter part of his life he applied himself chiefly to works of munisicence and charity: He was a great benefactor to Lincoln college, whereof he had been fellow and rector; and laid out large sums in beautifying the palace at Dur∣ham.</P>
<P>Many men have been canonized for much inferior works of beneficence than those of this prelate; his mistaken principles in the affairs of government, though they stain his memory, under the pens of political writers, are all obliterated from the benevolent mind by his charity and extensive acts of munificence. Some short time before his death, viz. 24th June, 1720, he made his last will and testa∣ment, whereby, after providing for his funeral, and giving several legacies to his friends, he devised unto the honourable John Montague, D. D. and then rector of Lincoln college in Oxford; the Rev. William Lupton, D. D. and prebendary of Durham; and to the Rev. Thomas Eden, LL.D. and also prebendary of Durham, their heirs and assigns, his several manors of Bamborough and Blanchland, and the advowsons, donations, and right of patronage and presentation to the churches of Bamborough and Shotley, and all other his manors, advowsons, messuages, cottages, mills, mines, quarries, meadows, pastures, closes, woods, underwoods, fishings, fisheries, tithes, rectories, rents, services, lands, tenements and heredita∣ments whatsoever, with their rights, members, royalties, privileges, and appurte∣nances, situate, being, or renewing within the town-fields, liberties, parishes, pre∣cincts or territories of Bamborough, Blanchland, Thornton, Sunderland, Shorf∣ton, Heatham, Bradnell, Berwick, Burton, Newham, Bradford, Fryars Lucker, Warringford, Monsin, Warrington, Tuggle, Budle, Shildon, Hadderyburn, Shot∣ley, Westhaugh-head, Easthaugh-head, Easthaugh foot, Thornton, Edmondshill, Houndsdonworth, Holy Island, and Norham, in the counties of Northumberland and Durham, which he had then lately purchased, and were of the yearly value of 1312 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 13 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> or thereabouts, upon the trusts therein and herein-after declared.

And the residue of the rents he did will and direct should for ever after be applied and disposed by his said trustees to such charitable uses as he should appoint, and for want of such appointment, to such charitable uses as the said trustees should appoint. And by a proviso, the testator directed, that no part of such surplus rents should be given by his trustees for the increase or augmentation of any of the gifts, charities, or benefactions by him given to the university of Oxford, Lincoln college, or the city of Durham. He gave to the chancellor, masters, and scholars of Oxford, the pic∣tures of Charles II. and Catharine his consort, and of James II. and Mary his con∣sort, all drawn by Mr Riley. And that the said manors, &amp;c. in the counties of Northumberland and Durham might be for ever thereafter conveyed and assured to the uses and under the trusts appointed as aforesaid, his will was, that when any one or two at the most of the trustees should die, then the survivors should within three months elect one or more clergymen, and no other persons, to be trustee or trustees, so as never to exceed five in number, which new trustees should have the same powers as those appointed by the will; and within three months after such election, the surviving trustees should grant and convey all the said manors, &amp;c. to the use of the surviving trustees, and of such persons so to be chosen trustees, and to their heirs and assigns, to the uses appointed, &amp;c. the rector of Lincoln col∣lege for ever to be one. He gave all his books for such uses as he should appoint, and for want of such appointment, as his trustees should think sit; and after di∣recting the trustees charges to be paid, he makes them residuary legatees and exe∣cutors in trust, to apply his undisposed effects to such charitable uses as they should think proper.

Wortley, late ambassador to Constantinople, his silver cistern; to Mr James Montague his gilt tankard; to Mr Ralph Trotter the picture of Dorothy lady Crewe; to Dr William Lupton his picture drawn by Sir God<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rey Kneller, in his baron's robes; to the mayor and aldermen of the city of Oxford a dozen of silver plates for the use of the corporation, a silver plate for the altar of North-Verdon, and 30 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> towards the altar-piece; to his secretary Mr Richard Grey his palatine and episcopal silver seals and seal manual.</P>
<P>He was very attentive to his palatine rights, and made strict enquiry into the ancient records, which he caused to be thoroughly searched, and stated by his sec∣retary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The copy I have is in Mr Stonh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wer's hand-writing, and dated "21 Feb. 1697, 10 Will'm III. 23 pont. &amp; transt.

He says<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 38.</NOTE>, <Q>Of the episcopal order of this realm, none of them set up or “aspired to so great temporal power as the bishops of Durham, who alone have long used and boasted of their united power of the sword and gown, as appears by the maxim found in Bracton, <HI>Dunelma sola judicat onse et stola.</HI> At the be∣ginning of the late revolution, an attempt was made in parliament to take away this county palatine and temporal power of the bishops of Durham; but it did not succeed, because the government was not then well settled, and there was not then a union with Scotland<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Reasons for continuing the county palatine of Durham.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the said county is an ancient county palatine, and was made such in the time of William the Conqueror, as some hold,—see Davis's Rep. fo. 61 6. Le case del co. palatine de Wexford; or at least in the beginning of the reign of Richard I. as others write,—vide Spelman's Glossar. Verb. Comites, and ib. De Comitatibus Inferiorum Aetatum, sect. confertur.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the said county hath all the courts of justice, and the same jurisdiction royal that was granted to the D. of Lancaster by the charter of Edward III.—Davis's Rep. fol. 62.—See also Co. 2. Institut. 357 Verb. but otherwise; and 4 Institut. 216 Verb. Yet I find, fol. 218, ib. verb. in an information.—Vide etiam Manley's Interp. Verb. Franchise; where it is said, the counties of Durham, Chester, &amp;c. are called in one of the statutes of this realm <HI>Seigniories Royal.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That since this county was made a county palatine, it hath enjoyed the privileges, immunities, and ex∣emptions of a county palatine, inviolably and uninterruptedly; saving, that in the 7th year of Edward VI. the then great duke of Northumberland procured the bishopric of Durham to be dissolved by an act of par∣liament (which is not printed among the public acts, but is mentioned in Wingate's Abridgement Verb. Durham). But it was afterwards restored in the parliament of Mary I. and thereby are annexed to the coun∣ty palatine of Durham all jurisdictions, ecclesiastical and temporal, as Wingate says in the place above cited. And at all times, right and justice have, within the same county, been distributed to such of the inhabitants thereof as have sued for the same in any of the courts of the county palatine; which has been and is of great ease and advantage to the people of the whole county in general, and of the city of Durham in particular: And that the rather, because they are not obliged to have recourse to London, to sue when they have occa∣sion, but may have right done them within their own county.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That all the bishops of Durham, at their first entrance and enthronization, take a solemn oath, to defend and preserve all the accustomed rights, and privileges, and immunities of the bishopric and county palatine of Durham: And the city of Durham, and all other corporations in that county, hold their charters from the bishop, to the observance of whose privileges they are all sworn and bound, not to attempt or act any thing to the contrary; as saith bishop Cosin, the late bishop of Durham, in his answer made to certain printed reasons for knights and burgesses to represent the county palatine of Durham<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See pages 540 and 543 of this work.</NOTE>.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That the present king, in his declaration when prince of Orange, 10th Oct. 1688, shewing the reason<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> why he entered England, declares, <HI>(inter alia)</HI> That his expedition was intended for no other design, but that all the boroughs of England should return to their ancient prescriptions and charters; and therefore, it is humbly hoped, that the county of Durham, and town corporate of the same county, shall have continued to them their prescribed rights of the county palatine.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. That if, these reasons notwithstanding, authority shall not think fit to continue the same county pala∣tine, in the name and person of the bishop of Durham; nevertheless, it is hoped, that the said county will be annexed to the crown, so as to remain a county palatine still: And that the rather, for that the county pa∣latine of Chester, which is another county palatine by prescription, was made a county palatine in the time of the Conqueror, and Hugh Lupus was made first count palatine thereof,—Co. 4. Inst. 211. Verb. we find; and Manley's Interp. Verb. Pleas of the Sword. And though afterwards Hemy III. took it into the crown, who gave other lands in exchange for it to the aunts and coheirs of the said Hugh Lupus, (to which seizure the king was induced <HI>Ne tanta haereditas inter colos diduceretur,</HI> as saith the aforesaid bishop of Durham, in his second or larger answer made to the aforesaid printed reasons) yet did the said county continue a coun∣ty palatine, and still does so, save as to some alterations made by the statute in the time of Henry VIII.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>[Ex quod. MSS. Gab. Swainston penes Tho. Gyll.]</P></NOTE>; and therefore it was not thought prudent to make any alteration in the administration of affairs in this county, bordering upon Scotland, only by taking away the lieutenancy from the then bishop, and
<PB N="562" REF="620"/>lodging it in the late right honourable Richard earl of Scarborough. It has been generally esteemed, (and so many of the most eminent lawyers have been heard to say) that all county palatines, franchises, peculiar liberties, and inferior jurisdictions, were a prejudice to the subject in general, and cramp the execution of the laws; and that it was most reasonable that all his majesty's subjects should be on the same bottom, and governed by the same laws. The bishops of Dur∣ham have for many ages claimed and held this county palatine by prescription; and the reason that hath been always assigned for the usage of such county pala∣tine was, that it bordering upon Scotland, then frequently in wars with England, it was requisite to lodge an immediate power in some neighbouring nobleman, to raise troops to defend the country, and oppose the sudden inroads of the Scots, and that for expedition sake was often necessary, before the kings of England could be timely consulted, they being often abroad in foreign dominions, in wars, ”and upon other public occasions.</Q></P>
<P>Mr Spearman also tells us, <Q>That bishop Crewe, in the latter end of his time, “made an entry upon an estate at<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The estates at Hulam and Sheraton, which gave occasion for the following letter, were part of the in∣heritance of the family of Stroud, and afterwards sold by Mr Evans to lady Carr, widow of Sir Ralph Carr senior, and by her devised to her grandson Ralph Carr of Cocken, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> who, in the year 17<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9, sold the same to Anthony Wilkinson of Durham, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> for 8520 <ABBR>l</ABBR> and in whose family it remains.—Gyll's MSS.</NOTE> Hullam and Sheraton, upon the death of serjeant Stroud, he claiming the same as an escheat for want of an heir, and got the te∣nants to attorn, and kept possession till the heir at law, Mr Evans, brought his ejectment. This the bishop illegally did, without an office found; but was told by the heir at law's solicitor, (Mr Wm Lee) in a letter<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"My lord, the rights and privileges of your lordship's county palatine having been often examined in parliament, upon several petitions and informations, which have been exhibited both by and against your lordship's predecessors, Mr Evans is advised by his counsel, to exhibit his information in parliament against your lordship; for that your lordship and agents have entered upon and detain his inheritance, (under pre∣tence for being an escheat) without having either your lordship's title first sound upon record, or suing out of legal process, to warrant the entry of your lordship's officers.
<P>This proceeding, my lord, he is advised, is a manifest violation of the rights and privileges of the gentle∣men and freeholders of the county of Durham, established to them by the public submissions of your lord∣ship's predecessors; confirmed and ratified by the crown.</P>
<P>That it is directly contrary to the known usage and constitution of the county palatine; that it tends to vest a higher prerogative in your lordship, than is claimed and enjoyed by the crown itself, who cannot, in this case, enter upon the estate of any subject, without an inquisition first ta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n to find the title of the crown:</P>
<P>That it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to subvert and evade the several laws made for restraining of the prerogative, and for securing the rights and properties of the subject; particularly by the statute of Magna Charta, chap. 29. which pro∣vides, that no s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>emen be disseized of his freehold, without lawful judgment of his peers. Stat. 28. Edw. III. chap. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rther provide<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that no man shall be disinherited without due process of law; and hath been fine<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> confirmed by the petition of right, 3 Char. I. chap. 1. and the statute 16 Char. I. chap. 14 that it is also contrary to the statute of 5 Rich. II. chap. 7. which provides, that none shall make entry into any lands, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y is given by law: As also the statute 8 Hen. VI. chap. 9. made against forcible detainer o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ssion; and several other statutes and public laws, too tedious to be recited:</P>
<P>That if such proceeding as this should be brought into practice, it would absolutely destroy the ancient privilege, which all the freeholder<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in this county l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e hitherto enjoyed, in having an opportunity given them to defend their rights, b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the inquisition, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> finding the title of the bishop, and traversing the imposition after i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is take<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>And if this proceeding against Mr Evans can be justified, it is conceived, the bishop of Durham may, un∣der colour of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> right, enter and seize upon all men's inheritances within the county, and put all to make out their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, before the bishop makes out any.</P>
<P>Your <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ordsh <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> certainly been very ill advised in this affair, and if the opinion of any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t counsel has been taken, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> have either been misinformed, or not very well instructed in the constitution, rights and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the county palatine.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, undertake to produce five thousand precedents of inquisitions taken, for finding the bishop's title upon record, before an entry was ever made; and it does appear, that the bishop's officers used always <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, in cases of this nature, by virtue of a special writ for that purpose, setting <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orth the title as it was found; and (indeed my lord) I have reason to believe that such a seizure at this was never at∣tempted by any of your lordship's predecessors, since the time of Anthony Be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</P>
<P>That bishop (whose character your lordship cannot be unacquainted with) did take upon him to seize on several estates within the county, without suing out any writ or commission for having his title first sound, and without awarding of any process, to warrant that entry: But how sensible the gentlemen of the county then were of the tendency it had to bring them under slavery and arbitraty government, what disturbance it bred within the county, and what were the consequences that attended that case, will best appear from the records of those times.</P>
<P>I shall only beg leave to put your lordship in mind, that one of the articles then agreed to between that bishop and the gentlemen and freeholders of the county, upon the mediation of king Edward I. was, That neither the bishop, nor any of his successors, should ever afterwards seize any man's estate without first suing a writ or commission out of the bishop's court of chancery.</P>
<P>I doubt (my lord) your lordship's agents do not distinguish very well betwixt the case of the bishop of Dur∣ham, and of an ordinary lord of any manor, where no person is in possession of the estate, against whom he may bring his escheat, for otherwise, the lord of the manor would be without remedy.</P>
<P>But the bishop of Durham will appear, I believe, to stand upon a different foot; he has rather remedy for escheat, and ought to be considered as a public person, <HI>(quasi rex)</HI> and under a capacity much different from a private lord of a petty manor; such a right in a private lord, and in a particular case only, cannot be hurtful to the public; but such a power in the crown, or in the bishop of Durham, who has <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ra regalia,</HI> within his county palatine, may admit of a different consideration.</P>
<P>It must be agreed, my lord, that the bishops of Durham have been always esteemed to be persons invested with royal dignity, or as it is expressed in the ancient record, <HI>jurisdictionem tempora<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em in omnes s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lditos suos libertatis Dunelmensis et authoritaten: regium tanquam personae privilegits regalibus, insig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> minis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ros, exer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>runt;</HI> or as another record expresses it, <HI>tanquam reges et principes mitram gess<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gnum su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e regalitatis;</HI> yet it must be allowed at the same time, that all the liberties of the bishop have been adjudged to be derived, and still dependent upon the crown, to be circumscribed by the same laws, to be all forfeited up∣on the misuser or abuse of them, during the bishop's time who commits the abuse; and that they have been accordingly seized, both upon judgment in parliament, and other counts; and that the reason given in some of these judgments, why the bishop's liberty ought to be forfeit, for any misuser or abuse of it, is, <HI>quia justum est quod in eo quo pecc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. in e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pumatur;</HI> or as we find it expressed in another of them, <HI>in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o quo insignitis de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inquit, sit de jure puni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dus.</HI></P>
<P>In short (my lord) Mr Evans is advised, this proceeding is a very great misuser of the liberty, and he having received your lordship's answer, that he is not to expect any favour, or any resitution of his estate, until he do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> by law recover it; your lordship having likewise thought sit to deprive him of all the best counsel of the cir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uit, he is partly necessitated, and does resolve to exhibit informations, both in parliament and the court of Queen's B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nch, in order to have the illegality of these proceedings examined into.</P>
<P>I was indeed desired by him to exhibit his information in parliament, the first day that the parliament sat, but I was unwilling, in a case of this nature, to take any advantage of your lordship's absence, or to pro∣ceed any further upon it, until I had given your lordship fair notice of the measures intended to be taken; so that your lordship might have an opportunity of advising further upon the case, and of being satisfied, in these matters, from your lordship's own counsel.</P>
<P>Mr Evans, my lord, knows nothing as yet, of my writing any thing to your lordship; but I must do jus∣tice to my client, and intend to let him know by next post, what I have done, for he is very pressing to have his prosecution carried on with all vigour and expedition; and it cannot, I think, reasonably be expected, that an estate of three or four hundred pounds per annum should be lost without some struggle; o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that, the title of Mr Evans, which has been long since proved, allowed and decreed by the court of chancery, is to be easily overthrown by an imaginary title, that has not yet, in fifty years time, been so much as sound by a common inquest.</P>
<P>It is true, my lord, Mr Evans, at present, is somewhat a stranger to most of the gentlemen of the country, and his interest in parliament is not, perhaps, very considerable; however, he does not doubt, but that jus∣tice will prevail in that honourable house, and that some will be sound to stand up in the defence of the liber∣ties of the country.</P>
<P>I am afraid, my lord, I have trespassed too much upon your lordship, but your lordship may be assured, if it were not from a respect I have for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> lordship's honour, as well as interest. I should <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> so much pains to convince your lordship, and to deprive myself, at the same time, of these advantages, which I had reason to expect from such a prosecution as this might be.</P>
<P>I shall submit the whole to your lordship's censure and consideration, hoping your lordship will believe me to be, with the utmost respect, my lord, your lordship's most obedient servant, WILLIAM LEE."</P>

<P><HI>The case of the dean and chapter of Durham, upon the bill depending in parliament for enabling archbishops, bishops, and others, to grant leases of mines not accustomably letten.</HI></P>
<P>Deans and chapters have been and are esteemed as the counsel of archbishops and bishops; and, amongst other good purposes, to consent to every grant, &amp;c. which they shall make to bind successors; it not being reasonable to repose so great a charge or confidence in any sole person, or to give power to any one person only, to prejudice his successors, (Coke 3, Report, dean and chapter of Norwich's case.) Deans and chap∣ters, as is well known, did accordingly constantly confirm all such leases, before the enabling statute was made, 32 Hen. VIII. and had an undoubted right to do so, by the common law: And if that enabling sta∣tute, or the private statute 1 Eliz. and other the restraining statutes made in her reign, for abridging archbi∣shops and bishops, and other ecclesiastical persons, from making long leases, have not varied or taken away such the ancient right of deans and chapters, which they had by the common law, and constant immemorial usage before that statute, such right of confirmations must still, and does now belong unto them.</P>
<P>It must be admitted, that by the enabling statute, 32 Hen. VIII, in all leases made for three lives, or twen∣ty-one years in pursuance thereof, all the restrictions and necessary requisites thereby enacted, must be punc∣tually observed, or such leases will not be good against successors, unless confirmed by deans and chapters; and such leases as are good by that statute, must be of lands or hereditaments, not in the hands of any farmer, by way of old leases; unless such old leases were expired or surrendered in a year after the new lease made; and it is expressly thereby declared, that such statute shall not extend to leases of reversions, nor to any here∣ditaments, not most commonly letten to farm, or occupied by farmers for twenty years before the making thereof, nor to any lease to be made, without impeachment of waste; nor to any leases made for above twenty-one years, or three lives from the making; and upon which there be reserved yearly to the lessors, their heirs and successors, according to their respective estates, so much yearly farm or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent, or more, as had been most accustomably yielded and paid, within twenty years before such leases made, and other restrictions contained in that act. See 32 Hen. VIII, c. 27.</P>
<P>The private statute 1 Eliz. or subsequent statutes in her reign, make no alteration in any of the restrictions which are in the statute of the 32 Hen. VIII. and it is conceived, those statutes only were made for prevent∣ing the making long leases with confirmations, as were then accustomed to be done, to the great damage and injury of the successors, but no way to alter or take away the right which deans and chapters had to confirm leases, made by archbishops and bishops, of mines, or any other of the inheritances of the church, not comprised in those statutes; for the farther illustration of which undoubted right of deans and chapters, see bishop Gibson's <HI>Codex Juris,</HI> p. 781, wherein are the following words:</P>
<P>"Confirmation is only necessary to the leases of sole corporations, as bishops, &amp;c. with parsons and vicars; so it was, and so it still remains at common law; by which, corporations aggregate of many, might of them∣selves make any grant of, or out of the possessions which they held in common; but the law did not think fit to trust a single person, or sole corporation, with the disposition of estates held in right of the church; and therefore, by way of restraint, appointed the assent and confirmation of some others, without which their grants should not be valid against the successor; accordingly, all leases of archbishops and bishops, to bind their successors, were to be confirmed by the dean and chapter; and all leases of archdeacons, prebendaries, and the like, by bishop, dean, and chapter, with some exceptions in case of patronage, which are not now material; and all leases of parsons and vicars, by patron and ordinary.</P>
<P>But all these, except parsons and vicars, were enabled by 32 Hen. VIII. to let leases for one and twenty years, or three lives without confirmation, provided, that in such leases, the conditions and limitations of the said act, as to the expiration of the old lease, the commencement of the new, the reservation of the rent, &amp;c. were punctually observed; but if not, confirmation remained necessary as before, in order to bind the succes∣sor; and with confirmation, long leases of sole corporations continued to be good against the successor, as they had been at common law.</P>
<P>From all which, as well as from the bill itself now before the House, it is plain, that the leases which are thereby intended to be made of mines, are not, nor can be included in the enabling act of 32 Hen. VIII. or of the subsequent statutes of the 1, 13, and 18 of queen Elizabeth; because mines yet to be discovered, can∣not be hereditaments most commonly letten, or occupied by farmers for twenty years; nor can leases be made of mines without impeachment of waste, because defacing and destroying the surface, and scooping out and carrying away the bowels of the inheritance, must occasion the committing waste; nor can it be supposed that a rent can be reserved as accountably paid for twenty years, of a mine which has never yet been letten; and if so, deans and chapters must have the same right now as they had at the common law before the statutes above-mentioned were made, which, it must be admitted, have not as yet destroyed, or taken away their right of confirmations of leases of mines, which they had, and now have by common law.</P>
<P>Leases made by parsons and vicars are excepted out of the statute of 32 Hen. VIII. and are not good un∣less confirmed by the patron and ordinary; and the present bill takes the same care of patron and ordinary, as that statute did; and it is hoped this honourable House will take the same care to preserve the undoubted rights of deans and chapters, there being no good reason to be assigned, why the rights of those excepted out of the enabling statute of the 23 Hen. VIII. should be saved; and yet at the same time, by the same bill, the rights of the persons not comprised therein stand (in point of justice) at least on the same foot as to the rights and properties.</P>
<P>It must be admitted, that the bill gives the same power to deans and chapters, as to mines in their own proper estates, which it doth to archbishops and bishops; and if deans and chapters had no right but as les∣sors, such right ought to be excepted, as it is by the saving clause; but since they have another plain right by the common law and immemorial usage, namely, to confirm the leases of mines let by archbishops and bishops, no just reason can be assigned to take away and destroy such their right by a new law, which the petitioners, the dean and chapter of Durham, do neither request nor want, nor conceive to be of any benefit or advantage to them.</P>
<P>For which and other reasons, they humbly hope the bill shall be rejected, or so amended, as effectually to save their rights, as well with respect to confirmations, as all other their own just rights; and likewise to preserve the inheritance of the church for the benefit of the successors of the present archbishops and bi∣shops, who, as the petitioners conceive, were to be assisted by the deans and chapters, to consent to every grant, &amp;c. to be made by such archbishops and bishops; by which restraint all such inconveniences as might arise by reposing so great a trust in a single person, or by giving him power to prejudiice his succession, might be, and would, as it hitherto hath been, effectually prevented.</P>
<P><HI>The case of the copyhold and leasehold tenants of the bishopric of Durham. for enabling bishops and others to grant leases of mines not accustomably letten by them.</HI></P>
<P>The bishops of Durham being seised of divers manors within that bishopric, wherein are many copyhold lands, which have for many hundreds of years, and time immemorial, been held in fee, upon payment of sines certain, and of certain small rents, the said estates have been so freely enjoyed by the tenants thereof, that the same have been, in many respects, esteemed as valuable, as most freehold estates within the said bishopric.</P>
<P>These copyhold estates are transferred by surrender, and upon such surrender, or upon death of the copy∣holder dying seised, admittances have been granted to the next heir, or to the party to whose use the sur∣render was made; and according to the tenor or import of such admittances, the said copyholders have claimed their estate and interest in the said lands.</P>
<P>It has been apprehended, that the said copyhold tenants having, by such admittances, been admitted te∣nants to the said lands, or to the <HI>terra firma</HI> or soil of the same, and without any exception of the mines or quarries therein; that the copyholders, in such case, are intitled to the said mines and quarries within their own grounds, as parcel of the soil granted to them, save only in such particular cases where such mines or quarries have, within any particular lands, been accustomably granted, or held in lease, from the bishops of the said See.</P>
<P>But though the absolute right of the said copyhold tenants to the said mines and quarries, within their own grounds, hath been questioned by some persons; yet it hath never been denied, but that the copyholders of the said bishopric, as well as other copyhold tenants, have a special right to the produce or profite of the soil of their said lands, and that they may, for many purposes, dig and work the soil thereof, and not only use the lime-stone, and other quarries within the said grounds, but work the other mines also, where there is any custom or usage to warrant their so doing</P>
<P>And whatever right or interest the bishop of Durham may be supposed, or presumed, to have in the mines within these copyhold lands; yet it must be allowed, that he cannot by law justify the breaking up or sink∣ing in the copyholders said grounds, or destroying the profits of the said soil, in order to search for or open any mines in the same; and that he cannot justify the laying of any waggon-ways, or the making of other ways, through the said grounds, nor can fell such wood as may be necessary for working the said mines, be∣cause such liberties may very much tend to the absolute destruction of the said copyholders estates.</P>
<P>The said copyhold tenants having such rights in their said estates, it is plain that the bishop cannot at pre∣sent, without their consents and special agreement, open any mines within their said grounds, nor can fell the wood growing, nor grant any power, or proper liberties, for working the said mines; so that in this case, the only way at present to make profit or advantage of any such mines, is either for the bishop to obtain the leave and consent of the copyholders therein, and upon such terms and agreements as the copyholders shall think fit, or that the copyholders should work them, upon making some reasonable acknowledgment to the bishop, upon obtaining his licence to work the same.</P>
<P>Thus it is apprehended the case stands at present with respect to the copyhold tenants: And as to the leaseholders, their lands and estates having been accustomably granted, time beyond memory, without either exception of mines, or of way leaves, or other exception that can give the bishop any manner of right to open or work mines within their inclosures, or to cut down their woods, or to do other acts that may tend to destroy the profit of their farms; it is conceived, that as well the said leaseholders, as copyhold tena<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, may maintain actions at law for any wrong or injury that may be done in prejudice to their several and re∣spective rights.</P>
<P>Now it is humbly apprehended that this bill, which is depending for enabling bishops to grant leases of mines, without any special savings or proper provisions for the benefit of the said copyhold and leasehold te∣nants, may (as the same is contrived) very much tend to the ruin and destruction of their said estates; that it will give a liberty to the working of those mines without their consents, to the laying of waggon-ways through their grounds, to the cutting down the wood for the use of the said mines, and the doing all man∣ner of damage both in their corn-fields, meadows, and pastures, without providing the least satisfaction or recompence for the same.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be alledged in defence of this bill, that the general saving in it will be sufficient to secure the several particular and special interests both of the leaseholders, copyholders, and other persons.</P>
<P>In answer to which, it may be observed, that the general saving is no more than what's userted of course in most bills, but is found in many cases to be so deficient, that it's frequently supplied by special savings and other provisions.</P>
<P>That the most that can be said to be saved in this case, is a right to bring actions for the recovery of da∣mages that shall be sustained by the working the said mines. But it is conceived, that where a power is once granted to lease out the mines, an action for damages is little more than an after-game; and the most that can be got by such general saving, may be a multitude of suits, wherein the leasehold and copyhold te∣nants may from time to time be involved with the bishop and his lessees.</P>
<P>Besides, it may be questioned how far the said general saving may extend to any persons that shall become lessees after the time of passing the said act.</P>
<P>But be that as it will, the giving such a power to lease these mines, may give a handle to some bishops to extend the power that's granted by the act, by inserting exceptions of mines and way-leaves, and other new liberties, in all leases that shall be renewed. And there is the greater reason to apprehend such proceeding, in regard that the same has been in some places already begun, which may tend further to defeat the rights of the said several leasehold tenants.</P>
<P>It may be further observed, that there are several things very speciously suggested in this bill; as, that the opening of these mines will be of advantage to the public; as also, that such leases are to be granted and re∣newed without the taking of any fines.</P>
<P>As to the benefit which may accrue to the public by the discovery and working of more mines; it is con∣ceived that the advantage to the public will be the same, in case the said leaseholders and copyholders have the working of those mines which shall be discovered in their own grounds, upon their paying a reasonable duty or acknowledgment to the bishop. And the giving a power by this act to let leases thereof to any stranger, may be attended with many inconveniencies.</P>
<P>As to what is proposed with respect to the granting and renewal of leases without fines, it cannot be at all objected against, provided care be taken that this seeming benefit is not defeated by the other dark clause in the same act, whereby such mines are excepted as have been accustomably letten within the greatest part of twen∣ty years past; the designs of which clause ought, it's conceived, to be better explained on many accounts.</P>
<P>And it's hoped, that care will be taken not only for inserting proper provisions in this bill with respect to the said leasehold and copyhold tenants, but that all leases to be granted by virtue of this act, shall be for the usual terms of twenty-one years, or three lives; and that such leases as shall be granted by any of the bishops, be confirmed by the dean and chapter; so as care may be taken, that such reasonable rents or duties may be re∣served upon every such lease, as may be of some benefit to the successors, for whom very little provision is made by this bill.</P></NOTE>; for it appeared to them, that the
<PB N="570" REF="629"/>bill was calculated for the bishop of Durham and his family only, and not for his successors, and to deprive the copyholders and ancient leaseholders of
<PB N="571" REF="630"/>the mines within their inclosed grounds, which the bishops of Durham have of late claimed: The copyholds are descendable estates of inheritance to the ”heirs of the roll tenants.</Q></P>
<PB N="572" REF="631"/>
<P><Q>“By this bold step, one family would have engrossed, as much as in them lay, mines of immense value to themselves, without any regard either to the bishop's successors, or to the tenants and their posterity: The bill appeared to be of very ill consequence, since the bishop of Durham, who is mostly concerned in coal∣mines, had the less reason to attempt the mines within the inclosed copyholds of his tenants and ancient leaseholds; for that he hath advantage enough by mines within many of the wastes of his several manors in the bishopric of Durham, which are very large, and where the bishop and his lessees may work mines for ages to come; he cannot therefore have any reason to injure the co∣pyhold and ancient leasehold tenants, by endeavouring to destroy their inclosed ”grounds,</Q> except the object of enriching his family by such leases.</P>
<P>Sir John Eden being then one of the representatives for the county of Durham, strenuously opposed this bill in the commons; though it must not be forgot, that his fellow member, Mr Hedworth, refused to give the tenants any assistance, or to join in the petition against it; however, the oppositions against it were held so rea∣sonable, that the bill underwent great amendments, which occasioned those who had the conduct of it before parliament to drop it, and it did not pass. But many of the old prebendaries of Durham soon after dying, the bishop had the opportu∣nity of preferring many of his friends in their places; and thereby had a majo∣rity in the chapter to confirm such leases as he thought fit to grant.</P>
<P>Sir John Eden was greatly applauded by all the county of Durham for his con∣duct, and at his return from parliament was met by 1500 persons, to congratulate his arrival. This occasioned the bishop to call on his dependents and friends to meet him on his coming into the bishopric, and a cavalcade was formed by many gentlemen, clergymen, and others, on the 23d of January 1723, who attended him into Durham, with about thirty coaches in the train.</P>
<P>The other matter which hurt the bishop's popularity was, his insinuating to the dean and chapter the room there was for advancing the fines on their leases; and setting the pernicious example in his own.</P>
<P>In 1725, the bishop visited the dean and chapter, and exhibited articles. He continued in this See till his death, which happened at his house in Hanover-square, London, on the 10th of October 1730, and was buried privately in St James's church, Westminster. He was of a magnificent taste and temper, which often run him into difficulties, his great revenue not being answerable to his expences, and his son was often obliged to extricate him from his embarrassments. After the de∣cease
<PB N="573" REF="632"/>of his first wife, who died without issue, he entered into a second marriage with Catharine, daughter of alderman King, of London, by whom he had eight sons and several daughters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2d, Edward, who was born in the city of Worcester, and bred at Oriel college in Oxford, where, after taking his first degree of arts, he was chosen fellow 30th Oct. 1712. He proceeded M. A. 14th Oct. 1714; and resigned his fellowship 10th Oct. 1715, apparently on account of his marriage with Mary, daughter of the Rev. Mr Martin. He died in 1720, archdeacon of Berkshire, having issue an only daughter, Catharine.

<P>The bishop's daughters were, Henrietta Maria, married to Dr Charles Trimnel, lord bishop of Win∣chester; and Catharine, married to Exton Sayer, LL. D. who, being bred to the civil law at Trinity Hall in Cambridge, became a fellow of that college, and an advocate in Doctors' Commons; and after his marriage, was made spiritual chancellor of Durham, and surveyor of his majesty's land revenues, &amp;c. and died member of parliament for Totness in 1731.</P>
<P>Twelve of the bishop's sermons were published in 1731, in one vol. 8vo. in some of which he asserts the notion of Dr Samuel Clarke upon the Trinity.

<P>Bishop Chandler was a native of Ireland, and chaplain to Lloyd bishop of Win∣chester: He was rector of St Nicholas' in Worcester, and vicar of Prees in the county of Salop. On the 30th of April, 1696, he was nominated to a prebend in Litchfield, void by the death of the reverend Samuel Dugard. On the 21st of October, 1706, then having the degree of doctor in divinity, he was made a pre∣bendary of Worcester; was also a prebendary of Sarum, and rector of Wem in Shropshire; and, on the 17th of November 1717, was consecrated bishop of Litch∣field, from whence he was translated to Durham at the time before specified.</P>
<P>He was a very learned and ingenious divine. Among other works of his, the "Defence of Christianity, from the Prophecies of the Old Testament," which he wrote against Collins, is particularly mentioned. During the time he was engaged in this work, he held a constant correspondence with the learned Mr William Lowth, with whom he was particularly intimate.</P>
<P>Bishop Chandler married Barbara, the eldest daughter of Sir Humphrey Briggs<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Baronetage, vol. iii. p. 252.</NOTE>. One of his daughters was married to R. Cavendish, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> another to Wadham Wyndham, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> and another to the reverend Mr Brotherton. He died at his house in Grosvenor-square on the 20th of July, 1750, of the stone, (several large ones being found in his body when opened) and was buried at Farnham-Royal in the county of Bucks.

R. an attorney at D—, for the clerkship of the halmot court, vacant on the death of Mr John Mowbray, in 1735, which he nobly refused, and gave to his secretary Mr Whitaker, who was succeeded by Mr Wyndham. The office of spiritual chancellor he gave to his son Wadham, and that of prothonotary to his other son Richard; the constableship of the castle and clerk of the peace were conferred on his son-in-law, Wadham Wyndham, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> the keeper or rangership of Bed∣burn Park he granted to R.

<PB N="575" REF="636"/>
<P>The See continued vacant near two months, the king being then in Germany. On the 7th of September, JOSEPH BUTLER,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The portrait is copied from an original picture in the committee-room of the Infirmary at Newcastle, painted by Taylor.</NOTE> then bishop of Bristol, was translated to this See, and enthroned by proxy on the 9th of November. He was a prelate of the most distinguished character and abilities, was born at Wantage in Berkshire, in the year 1692. His father, Mr Thomas Butler, who was a substantial and reputable shopkeeper in that town, observing in his son Joseph (who was the youngest of eight children) an excellent genius and inclination for learning, determined to educate him for the ministry, among the protestant dissenters of the presbyterian denomination. For this purpose, after he had gone through a pro∣per course of grammatical literature, at the free grammar school of his native place, under the care of the rev. Mr Philip Barton, a clergyman of the church of Eng∣land, he was sent to a dissenting academy, then kept at Gloucester, but afterwards removed to Tewkesbury, where Mr Butler made an extraordinary progress in the study of divinity; of which he gave a remarkable proof, in the letters addressed by him to Dr Samuel Clarke, laying before him the doubts that had arisen in his mind, concerning the conclusiveness of some arguments in the doctor's "Demonstration of the being and attributes of God." The first of these letters was dated November 4th, 1713; and the sagacity and depth of thought displayed in it, immediately ex∣cited Dr Clarke's particular notice. This condescension encouraged Mr Butler to address the doctor again upon the same subject; which, likewise, was answered by him; and the correspondence being carried on in three other letters, the whole was
<PB N="576" REF="637"/>annexed to the celebrated treatise beforementioned, and the collection has been re∣tained in all the subsequent editions of that work. The management of this corres∣pondence was entrusted by Mr Butler to his friend and fellow pupil Mr Secker, who, in order to conceal the affair, undertook to convey the letters to the post-of∣fice at Gloucester, and to bring back Dr Clarke's answers. When Mr Butler's name was discovered to the doctor, the candour, modesty, and good sense with which he had written, immediately procured him the friendship of that eminent and ex∣cellent man. Our young student was not, however, during his continuance at Tewkesbury, solely employed in metaphysical speculations and enquiries. Another subject of his serious consideration was, the propriety of his becoming a dissenting minister. Accordingly, he entered into an examination of the principles of non∣conformity; the result of which was, such a dissatisfaction with them, as deter∣mined him to conform to the established church. This intention was at first very disagreeable to his father, who endeavoured to divert him from his purpose; and, with that view, called in the assistance of some eminent presbyterian divines; but finding his son's resolution to be fixed, he at length suffered him to be removed to Oxford, where he was admitted a commoner of Oriel college on the 17th of March, 1714. At what time he took orders doth not appear, nor who the bishop was by whom he was ordained; but it is certain, that he entered into the church soon after his admission at Oxford, if it be true, as is asserted, that he sometimes assisted Mr Edward Talbot in the divine service, at his living of Hen∣dred, near Wantage. With this gentleman, who was the second son of Dr Wil∣liam Talbot, successively bishop of Oxford, Salisbury, and Durham, Mr Butler formed an intimate friendship at Oriel college; which friendship laid the founda∣tion of all his subsequent preferments, and procured for him a very honourable situation, when he was only 26 years of age. For it was in 1718, that, at the re∣commendation of Mr Talbot, in conjunction with that of Dr Clarke, he was ap∣pointed by Sir Joseph Jekyll to be preacher at the Rolls. This was three years before he had taken any degree at the university, where he did not go out bachelor of law till the 10th of June, 1721, which, however, was as soon as that degree could statutably be conferred upon him. Mr Butler continued at the Rolls till 1726, in the beginning of which year he published, in one volume 8yo, fifteen ser∣mons, preached at that chapel. In the meanwhile, by the patronage of Dr Tal∣bot bishop of Durham, to whose notice he had been recommended, (together with Mr Benson and Mr Secker) by Mr Edward Talbot, on his death-bed, our author had been presented first to the rectory of Haughton, near Darlington, and afterwards to that of Stanhope, in the same diocese. The benefice of Haughton was given to him in 1722, and that of Stanhope in 1725. At Haughton, there was a necessity for<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He received from the executors of his predecessor Richard Bellassyse, for dilapidations, 60 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> as appears by the following original receipt, now in Mr Allan's possession: — <Q>August 25, 1722.

These, on his removal to Stanhope, were taken by his successor Mr Thorpe, wherewith he in part repaired the present parsonage.</NOTE> rebuilding a great part of the parsonage-house, and Mr Butler had
<PB N="577" REF="638"/>neither money nor talents for that work. Mr Secker, therefore, who had al∣ways the interest of his friends at heart, and had acquired a very considerable in∣fluence with bishop Talbot, persuaded that prelate to give Mr Butler, in exchange for Haughton, the rectory of Stanhope; which was not only free from any such incumbrance, but was likewise of much superior value, being indeed, at that time, one of the richest parsonages in England. Whilst our author continued preacher at the Rolls chapel, he divided his time between his duty in town and country; but when he quitted the Rolls, he resided, during seven years, wholly at Stanhope, in the conscientious discharge of every obligation appertaining to a good parish priest. This retirement, however, was too solitary for his disposition, which had in it a natural cast of gloominess; and though his recluse hours were by no means lost either to private improvement or public utility, yet he felt at times, very painfully, the want of that select society of friends, to which he had been accustomed, and which could inspire him with the greatest chearfulness. Mr Secker, therefore, who knew this, was extremely anxious to draw him out into a more active and conspicious scene, and omitted no opportunity of expressing this desire to such as he thought capable of promoting it. Having himself been appointed king's chap∣lain in 1732, he took occasion, in a conversation which he had the honour of hold∣ing with queen Caroline, to mention to her his friend Mr Butler. The queen said, she thought he had been dead: Mr Secker assured her he was not. Yet her majes∣ty afterwards asked archbishop Blackburne, if he was not dead? His answer was, "no, madam, but he is buried." Mr Secker continuing his purpose of endeavouring to bring his friend out of his retirement, found means, upon Mr Charles Talbot's being made lord chancellor, to have Mr Butler recommended to him for his chap∣lain. His lordship accepted, and sent for him; and this promotion calling him to town, he took Oxford in his way, and was admitted there to the degree of doctor of law, on the 8th of December 1733. The lord chancellor, who gave him also a prebend in the church of Rochester, had consented that he should reside at his pa∣rish of Stanhope one half of the year.</P>
<P>Dr Butler being thus brought back into the world, his merit and talents soon introduced him to particular notice, and paved the way for his rising to those high dignities which he afterwards enjoyed. In 1736, he was appointed clerk of the closet to queen Caroline; and, in the same year, he presented to her majesty a co∣py of his excellent treatise, entitled, "The analogy of religion, natural and re∣vealed, to the constitution and course of nature." His attendance upon his royal mistr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss, by her especial command, was from seven to nine in the evening every day; and though this particular relation to that excellent and learned queen was soon determined by her death in 1737, yet he had been so effectually recommended by her, as well as by the late lord chancellor Talbot, to his majesty's favour, that, in the next year, he was raised to the highest order of the church, by a nomination to the bishopric of Bristol; to which See he was consecrated on the 3d of Decem∣ber 1738. King George II. not being satisfied with this proof of his regard to Dr Butler, promoted him, in 1740, to the deanry of St Paul's, London; into which he was installed on the 24th of May in that year. Finding the demands of this dig∣nity
<PB N="578" REF="639"/>to be incompatible with his parish duty at Stanhope, he immediately resigned that benefice. Besides our prelate's unremitted attention to his peculiar obliga∣tions, he was called upon to preach several discourses on public occasions, which were afterwards printed, and have since been annexed to the latter editions of the sermons at the Rolls chapel. In 1746, upon the death of Dr Egerton bishop of Hereford, Dr Butler was made clerk of the closet to the king; and he in 1750, received another distinguished mark of his majesty's favour, by being translated to the See of Durham. This was on the 16th of October in that year, upon the de∣cease of Dr Edward Chandler. Our prelate, being thus appointed to preside over a diocese with which he had long been connected, delivered his first, and, indeed, his last charge to his clergy, at his primary visitation in 1751. The principal sub∣ject of it was, "Eternal religion."</P>
<P>By his promotion to the See of Durham, our worthy bishop was furnished with ample means of exerting the virtue of charity; a virtue which eminently abounded in him, and the exercise of which was his highest delight. But this gratification he did not long enjoy: He had been but a short time seated in his new bishopric, when his health began visibly to decline; and having been complimented, during his indisposition, upon account of his great resignation to the divine will, he is said to have expressed some regret that he should be taken from the present world so soon after he had been rendered capable of becoming much more useful in it. In his last illness, he was carried to Bristol, to try the waters of that place; but these proving ineffectual, he removed to Bath, where, being past recovery, he died on the 16th of June 1752. His corpse was conveyed to Bristol, and interred in the cathedral there, where a monument is erected to his memory.</P>
<P>On the greatness of bishop Butler's intellectual character we need not enlarge; for his profound knowledge, and the prodigious strength of his mind, are amply displayed in his incomparable writings. He was of a most reverend aspect: His face thin and pale; but there was a divine placidness in his countenance, which in∣spired veneration, and expressed the most benevolent mind: His white hair hung gracefully on his shoulders, and his whole figure was patriarchal. Officiating in the episcopal duties of the church whilst bishop of Durham, he gave a striking ex∣ample of piety and holy solemnity, which was of the most serious and fervent, and perhaps somewhat of the ascetic kind. His benevolence was warm, generous, and dissusive. Whilst he was bishop of Bristol, he expended, in repairing and im∣proving the episcopal palace, 4000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> which is said to have been more than the whole revenues of the bishopric amounted to during his continuance in that See. In the year 1752, he began to make great alterations in and about the castle at Durham, by pulling down the old tapestry hangings in the dining-room, and stuccoing the wall with ornaments below the cornice, adding some foliages on the joining of the compartments of the roof. He enlarged and put in new Gothic windows to the north. He also took down and rebuilt a considerable part of the outside wall of the castle at the north door (where his arms are placed) and which overhung the perpendicular line several inches; new floored the great west dining-room above stairs, and new-stuccoed and floored the judges apartments, and put new fire-places
<PB N="579" REF="640"/>therein. He also pulled down and rebuilt the eastern wall of the bowling-green at Auckland, and made great improvements in the park there, by levelling, plant∣ing, and destroying all the rabbits in it; and designed to add about 130 acres thereto, having actually begun to pale part of such new inclosure. Besides his private benefactions, he contributed 500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> to the Infirmary at Bristol, and was a subscriber to three of the hospitals at London. He was likewise a principal pro∣moter, though not the first founder, of the Infirmary at Newcastle, to which he gave 500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> In supporting the hospitality and dignity of the rich and powerful dio∣cese of Durham, he was desirous of imitating the spirit of his patron bishop Talbot. In this spirit, he set apart three days every week for the reception and entertainment of the principal gentry of the country. Nor were even the clergy who had the poorest benefices neglected by him. He not only occasionally invited them to dine with him, but condescended to visit them at their respective parishes. By his will, he left 500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> to the society for propagating the gospel in foreign parts, and some legacies to his friends and domestics. His chaplain, the rev. Dr Nathaniel Forster, was his executor, a divine of distinguished literature. Bishop Butler was never mar∣ried. Soon after his decease, the following lines, by way of epitaph, were writ∣ten concerning him; and were printed first, if we recollect right, in the London Magazine.</P>

<PB N="581" REF="643"/>daughter of colonel Robert Welding, and widow of Sir Robert Barnard, baronet. His lordship was born the 30th of September 1707; was first placed at Bishop-Stortford school in Hertfordshire, and, when of sufficient age, removed to West∣minster, where he staid till ripe for the university; was entered a gentleman com∣moner of Queen's college, Oxford, and had for his tutor Joseph Stedman, fellow of the same college; from hence elected fellow of All Souls in 1727, where he took his master of arts degree, 28th of January 1731; was presented, by Sir Ro∣bert Barnard, to the valuable living of Houghton with Witton, in the county of Huntington, 1732; succeeded Dr Thomas Terry (who died at Bath in 1735) in his canonry of Christ-Church, Oxford, and, on the 10th of June 1736, pro∣ceeded to the degree of doctor of the civil law, for which he went out (as the term is) grand compounder. In January, 1744, he was appointed, by his late majesty, bishop of St David's, on the promotion of Dr Edward Willes to the See of Bath and Wells; from thence he was translated to Durham, 9th of November 1752, and there enthroned by proxy on the 29th of December following.</P>
<P>In the year 1759, the chancellorship of the university of Oxford became vacant, on the death of Charles earl of Arran, for which honour the bishop stood competi∣tor with the earls of Westmorland and Litchfield. To attain this honourable sta∣tion, he was spurred on more by the advice and importunity of his friends, than by his own natural temper and inclination. He had the advantage of his opponents singly, but the earl of Litchfield giving his interest to lord Westmorland, the scales were turned, and, on the 4th of January 1759, the poll stood thus:</P>

<P>There was a singular dignity in his lordship's person; he was tall, well propor∣tioned, and of a carriage erect and stately. The episcopal robe was never worn more gracefully. His features were regular, manly, and expressive; his complex∣ion florid, and over his countenance was diffused an air of benignity, though ac∣companied with that presence, which, whilst it inspired esteem, commanded reve∣rence and distant respect.</P>
<P>His lordship resided all the summer months either at Durham or Auckland, but chiefly at the latter, where he made great improvements in the castle and park; used much exercise in walking, and enjoyed a good state of health until the year 1771.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This account was sound among the papers of Mr Robert Hutchinson, (brother to the author, and one of his lordship's domestics, who designed the prefixed portrait) and which discovers such a noble fortitude of mind at the approach of his dissolution, as could be inspired only by a clear conference, and the calm re∣trospect of an uninter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upted series of virtue.</NOTE> About the 10th day of March in that year, he began to be confined; a gangrene fore having attacked the tendons of his left foot, and a mortification of the most fatal kind ensued; the toes sloughed off one after another, by a slow but irresistible progress; every aid of medicine, and all that human art could do, was most assidu∣ously as well as judiciously administered by those two eminent surgeons, Drs Ad∣dington and Hawkins; nor could any thing tend more to assist the endeavours of those gentlemen, than the singularly prudent and composed behaviour of their pa∣tient,
<PB N="582" REF="644"/>who, during his whole confinement, took every medicine, and suffered every pain, with that firm composure of mind, which, by a strong and happy influence, assists the operations of nature. The bark was taken as long and in as large quan∣tities as ever known, and seemed to agree so well with his constitution, that, if the disease had been remediable, that alone would have effected a cure; but it was too malignant and inveterate, and had already taken a mortal hold on the whole habit. After having suffered, above two months, a copious discharge from the wound be∣low, and, as one should think, in some measure corrected by so long an absorption of antiseptic medicines, a new-fore, tending to a carbuncle, appeared on his back: This gave a damp to all hopes, and nothing remained but the dread of a miserable existence being too far prolonged: Henceforward it might be said, <HI>Quesitaeque nocent artes, cessere magistri.</HI> The poison now began gradually to creep up from the foot (already mortified) to the leg. As, on the one hand, life was incompati∣ble with such a mass, so, on the other, amputation, in his then habit of body and great weakness, afforded no other possible prospect but to embitter the conflict and hasten the event.</P>
<P>In this helpless situation did the bishop lie above twelve weeks, the latter part of which he did not suffer much pain, except when his foot or back were drest. The uneasiness of his posture, which admitted of no variety, must have grown intolera∣ble; I say must, because we are to judge of his feelings from our reason, not from his expression of them; for neither these nor his other sufferings (and others he had) ever drew from him a peevish word, melancholy ejaculation, or a desponding sigh. As long as his strength permitted, he sat up in his chair. Though he had no appetite, yet he continued to have a regular dinner, and two or three of his friends to dine with him. In short, he studied to conceal as much as possible the appearance of a sick man, and till within two days of his death, ought rather to have been called a wounded man; for though in fact the poison was every minute gaining ground, yet, wonderful to relate! it neither caused fever, head-ach, or any painful symptom.</P>
<P>His throat, for the last ten days, became sore and ulcerated: Though the spirits which depend upon the strength diminished with his strength, yet the firmness and tranquillity of his mind never suffered any change. He frequently took notice of that concern in the countenances of his friends and domestics, which they could not conceal, and he as often chid them for it. It was supposed he had but a bad opinion of his case from the first, having executed his will the 9th of April 1771, and it was evident he discovered the full extent of his calamity: But it was not the least of his philosophy to conceal these feelings, whilst he inwardly prepared himself for the awful scene he perceived was now approaching; how admirably he effected this, those that were spectators can bear testimony.</P>
<P>On Saturday morning the 8th of June, the bishop, from some inward feelings, be∣came more sensible of his approaching dissolution; he no more suffered himself to be taken up; and desired Dr Yorke, then bishop of St David's and minister of his parish, might be sent for to administer the facrament to him the following evening. The weakness of his situation, and fear of an approaching delirium, shewed the impro∣priety
<PB N="583" REF="645"/>of postponing the ceremony so long. Lord Trevor told his brother, that the bishop of St David's was not in town; but that his chaplain Mr Desalis was then ready, and begged to have the satisfaction of communicating with him immediate∣ly. The bishop said, he believed things were not so pressing; but however, if he He also desired that his nephew (Mr John Trevor, a young gentleman of the most promising character, and who had attended him with the most singular affection and assiduity) together with the rest of the family, might communicate with him: The ceremony was accordingly performed; and the bishop was the only person who, during this awful solemnity, was moved by no other affections than those of pure devotion. When this was over, he continued to lie in perfect ease of body, and still more perfect composure of mind. He desired lord Trevor and his nephew would sit by him, said something about settling his affairs, and gave directions about his burial; expressed the happiness he had experienced in lord Trevors long and cordial friendship, gave thanks to God for the resignation and fortitude with which he had been enabled to bear his afflictions, and thanked the world for the kind share of concern it had taken in his situation. He also talked some time very seri∣ously with Mr John Trevor; told him, <HI>that he believed he was not immediately going, but that he had then put himself in the posture in which he should wish to be ready when it pleased Providence to strike.</HI> He then desired the family to go to dinner, bidding the servants take particular care of his friends, and leave him as usual to go to rest. All Saturday evening and night he continued to rest quietly, though slight and par∣tial convulsions began to affect his arms and singers. He now and then had his mouth moistened, but no more took any medicines or solid food; desired that he might be prayed for the next morning in his parish church of St George. On Sunday morning he appeared much the same; but after the last dressing of his wounds, which was made as easy and short as possible, he grew much weaker, but still continued easy and perfectly sensible, except when convulsions came on, which now began to be more frequent and violent: He had four fits before evening; about six, being more quiet and perfectly sensible, he desired the prayers for the sick might be read to him, to which he repeated all the responses; but feeling another sit coming on, stopped the prayers; recovering therefrom, he fell asleep, and continued so till shook by more convultions, and had seven or eight after this, at intervals of about half an hour; still his senses were unaffected. He said to Mr John Trevor after one of the sits, <HI>Jack, you see me clinging to life much more than it deserves.</HI> About eleven at night, he asked the apothecary how he did; and these were the last words he uttered. While he continued to lie in an horizontal posture, he breathed with difficulty and uneasiness, and made a sign to be raised a little, which when done, he continued for about ten minutes to breathe away the last re∣mains of life almost impereeptibly, without a struggle or a groan. At a quarter before twelve he expired (June 9, 1771) in the 64th year of his age, and of his translation the 19th.</P>
<P>Thus at length was this excellent man released from all his suff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ings. leaving behind him an example of christian piety, fortitude, and resignation, which no hu∣man
<PB N="584" REF="646"/>being ever exceeded, and few have equalled. On the 19th of June, he was buried privately, (according to his own directions) at Glynd in Sussex, which church he rebuilt, and gave thirteen acres of land to the vicar and his successors for ever.</P>
<P>To draw the character of this reverend prelate requires the ablest pen. His me∣mory is fresh and flourishing in the breasts of most people now living, and posteri∣ty may be assured the following may be depended on for truth in every particular; the integrity of the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a sermon preached at Neweastle, 27th July 1771, before the governors of the Infirmary there, by John Rotheram, M. A. rector of Houghton-le-Spring, in the county of Durham.</NOTE> composer being above dispute, and his intimacy with the bi∣shop sufficiently known.</P>
<P>"Seldom have so many amiable and valuable qualities met together in one per∣son; seldom have virtues and accomplishments been so happily united as in the late bishop of Durham. If we consider him in private life, we shall find none more worthy of our love; if in public, none that could more justly claim our ve∣neration and esteem.</P>
<P>His personal accomplishments were such as could not fail to attract the notice, and win the regard of all with whom he conversed. His tenderness to those who had the happiness of being near him, was beyond example; which necessarily at∣tached to him more by affection than by any other bond of authority, interest, or sear, every feeling heart, capable of gratitude, and alive to the impressions of goodness.</P>
<P>His attainments in literature far surpassed his own modest estimate of them. His acquaintance with the history both of ancient and modern times was accurate and extensive. He was master of the best and purest writers of antiquity, and his memory was stored with their finest passages, which he applied with propriety and taste; whilst he felt and communicated the sublimer beauties of the sacred books with such energy and warmth of expression, as shewed that their divine fires touch∣ed his heart.</P>
<P>His knowledge of the affairs of men, and discernment of characters, spoke one who had been accustomed to read mankind with penetration and candour.</P>
<P>From these accomplishments of the head and heart flowed a conversation pleasing and instructive, which had all the strength that just observation, sentiment, and deep reflection could give, accompanied by all the graces that it could derive from an open and engaging countenance, a winning address, harmonious elocution, a language copious, correct, and natural, and a mind elegantly turned.</P>
<P>In a word, in private life we saw accomplishments supported by worth; polished manners and a pleasing form animated by intelligence and goodness of heart; out∣wardly, all that was graceful and becoming, whilst all was light and peace within.</P>
<P>His public character was such as did naturally result from so many private virtues and amiable endowments. The true intrinsic worth which he possessed, easily took an outward polish beyond what any art can give to baser materials.</P>
<P>He wore his temporal honors with dignity and ease. Never were the shining qua∣lities of the Palatine more justly tempered by the milder graces of the Diocesan.</P>
<PB N="585" REF="647"/>
<P>Liberality, munificence, and greatness of mind flowing from one source, were hap∣pily united with meekness, moderation, and humility derived from the other.</P>
<P>Invested with high authority, his influence, which was become general and ex∣tensive, seemed not so much the effect of power, as the result of reason and supe∣rior ability exerted for the public good.</P>
<P>He was sincerely and firmly attached to every thing that is excellent in our hap∣py constitution; wishing to see public authority and private liberty standing toge ther on the basis of public law; and public peace established by their concord.</P>
<P>A friend from principle to the interests of the church of England, his zeal for its welfare was directed by knowledge, and tempered by sentiments of purest cha∣rity towards all our dissenting brethren; which he expressed not only in private con∣versation, but in his public discourses, particularly in his last affectionate address to the clergy of his diocese, delivered at his final visitation in July and August 1770.</P>
<P>Easy of access to all, he was ever open to his clergy, and ready to assist them by his council and advice, or, where the case required it, by liberal contributions. Their complaints and grievances were received by him as into the bosom of a friend, and for them he had no authority but that of a parent. Amongst them, he was much more studious to find out merit, and distinguish good behaviour, than ready to remark or remember errors and failings.</P>
<P>Under every change of times, and through all the affairs both of public and pri∣vate life, he maintained a steady course, regular, uniform, and consistent. His measures were not taken from occasional situations, from wavering inclination, or considerations of present convenience. He acted on principles by their nature fixed and unchangeable. Religion had taken possession of his foul, and all his rules of conduct were transcribed into his heart from the royal law of christian charity: Therefore was his breast filled with candour, integrity, and truth; and therefore did he maintain a firmness and constancy, which they who proceed on principles of false honour or worldly policy, must admire but cannot equal.</P>
<P>His conceptions of the doctrines and design of christianity were noble and exalt∣ed: He felt their power, and wondered that it was not universally selt. How hath my soul been enflamed when I have heard his sentiments on this subject warm from his benevolent heart! "We may boast ourselves," he would say, "in the ad∣vancement we have made in the theory of our religion; but how must our pride be humbled when we compare our practice with our theory! Surely principles so great and glorious as those of the gospel, so full of the seeds of all blessings to hu∣man society, cannot always remain without their effect. No.—Revelation may be slow in working the sull purpose of Heaven, but it must be sure. Religion must one day be a very different thing from what we at present behold it: Christian charity cannot always be to the world a light without heat, a pale cold sire. Its warmth at length must be universally felt. The time must come, when our zeal shall ap∣pear to be kindled by this heavenly sire, and not by human passion; when all our little earthly heats be extinguished, and that pure and divine slame alone shall burn. The time will come, when animosity and violence, and rage shall cease; and when union, love and harmony shall prevail. The time will come, when earth shall bear a nearer resemblance to heaven." May his spirit be prophetie! May those
<PB N="586" REF="648"/>glorious effects of our blessed religion soon be accomplished; and may the happy pe∣riod he wished for soon arrive!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">RICHARD TREVOR, S. T. P. bishop of St David's, elected 9th Nov. 1752.

<ITEM><LABEL>Temporal chancellor,</LABEL> Sir Joseph Yates, knt. one of the judges of the K.

With this open and enlarged turn of mind, he pursued his enquiries with a perseverance and precision almost peculiar to himself, till the profession repaid him by storing his mind with an universal knowledge of its laws, which very rare∣ly falls to the lot of the greatest talents, or most diligent researches: His invinci∣ble modesty, however, repelled him the notice of the public for many years, till at last the repeated justness of his opinions and forcibility of his pleadings pro∣cured him a coif, from whence he was soon afterwards promoted to be one of the judges of the King's Bench. In this character he always conducted himself with a dignity and impartiality that reflected honour even on that respectable situation. The right of the subject and dignity of the crown were never occasionally explain∣ed by will or favouritism, but by the established language of the law; and a steady impartial observance of it formed the invariable rule of his conduct.—His char∣ges to juries were not the charges of an Asiatic Cadi delivering his own will, but the charges of a British Judge in the land of liberty, and will be remembered for many years with pleasure by the lovers of freedom and oratory. In these he ap∣peared more the guardian of the people than an officer of the crown; and hit that nice medium, as a distributor of justice, so strictly, that the offending party, whilst they felt the chastisement, could not help applauding the chastiser.—Though uni∣versal in his knowledge of the laws, his <HI>forte</HI> confessedly lay in common pleadings, with which he was more minutely acquainted than any man of his time. Sensible that his talents drew him more strongly this way, he, on the resignation of judge Clive, solicited to change from the King's Bench to the Common Pleas, wherein he succeeded, but which he did not long live to enjoy; his death, in 1770, de∣priving the world of one of the greatest judges of that court England perhaps ever boasted of.</ITEM>

He died a bachelor the 12th of March, 1780, aet. 80; and was buried at Barton, in the North-Riding of the county of York, where an elegant monu∣ment is placed, with the following inscription:
<Q>Near this Wall is interred THOMAS GYLL, <ABBR>ESQ</ABBR> Equally esteemed for his knowledge of the Common and Canon Law, and for his Integrity in the practice of both. At the Bar an Advocate in the former, On the Bench a Judge in the latter. Nor was he less distinguished for his Accuracy in the History and Antiquities of his Country. By a steady discharge of the duties of his Station both in public and private life, and by a constant and devout attendance on the public Worship, he was an example worthy of imitation. He died in his 80th year MDCCLXXX. To the Memory of his truly valuable character, Leonard Hartley his nephew and heir placed this Tablet.</Q></ITEM>

<P>Religion, thus understood, supported him to the end, and administred to his soul all its heavenly consolations under the last great trial to which humanity can be called; enabling him to give a proof worthy of a christian bishop, of the strength of his principles, and their ability to sustain the mind in that great and decisive hour, when all human help is withdrawn, and when every support fails and sinks under it.</P>
<P>Such was the late bishop of Durham, and such is the rude outline of a great and beloved character, attempted by an affectionate, though unequal hand: The finish∣ing shall be by the hand of an Apostle; for St Paul, in describing what a christian bishop ought to be, hath, in all the principal lines, described what our late lament∣ed diocesan was:—<HI>He was blameless, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach. He was not given to wine; he was no striker, nor greedy of filthy lucre, but patient; not a brawler, not covetous. He ruled well his own house, having his family in subjection with all gravity; for if a man knows not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God? He was neither a novice, nor lifted up with pride; and moreover, he had a good report of them which are without, so that he was free from all reproach.</HI>"</P>
<P>On the 9th of April, 1771, he made his will, and therein gave the following charities:

A certain small sine, called demise money, as marked on the margin of every surrender, is paid upon purchase, admittance of the heir, mortgagee, or other person, and cannot be enhanced at the will of the lord.—If any person pur∣chases a copyhold, and takes the surrender absolute to himself, his heirs, and se∣quels, in such case he cannot devise the same by will, unless he previously pass a surrender to a trustee to the use thereof; nor can the widow be entitled to her frank-bank <HI>durante viduitate et castitate,</HI> unless her husband dies seised, and the legal estate not vested in a trustee.</P>
<P>The bishop is entitled to work or demise by lease all the mines; he is also en∣titled to all wood, which the copyholder cannot cut (unless for necessary repairs) without licence and composition first made with the bishop.</P>
<P>In Gateshead and Whickham manors, the surrenders must be presented to the homage, or they are not legal; but in all the other manors, they are passed before the steward or his deputies.</P>
