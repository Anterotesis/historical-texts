<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Title of this Work is
an Index of the Perform∣ance.
It is a collection of
useful instructions for a
young Tradesman. The
world is grown so wise of late, or (if
you will) fancy themselves so, are so
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
<HI>opiniatre,</HI> as the <HI>French</HI> well express it,
so self-wise, that I expect some will
tell us beforehand they know every
thing already, and want none of my
instructions; and to such indeed these in∣structions
are not written.</P>
<P>HAD I not seen in a few years ex∣perience
many young Tradesmen mis∣carry
for want of those very cautions
which are here given, I should have
thought this Work needless, and I am
sure had never gone about to write it;
but as the contrary is manifest, I thought,
and think still, the world greatly want∣ed
it.</P>
<P>AND be it that those unfortunate
creatures that have thus blown themselves
up in trade have miscarried for want of
knowing, or for want of practising what
is here offered for their Direction, whe∣ther
for want of wit, or by too much
wit, the thing is the same, and the di∣rection
is equally needful to both.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="5"/>
AN old experienc'd pilot sometimes
loses a ship by his assurance and over∣confidence
of his knowledge, as effec∣tually
as a young pilot does by his ig∣norance
and want of experience; this
very thing, as I have been inform'd,
was the occasion of the fatal disaster in
which Sir <HI>Cloudesly Shovel,</HI> and so many
hundred brave fellows, lost their lives in
a moment upon the Rocks of <HI>Scilly.</HI></P>
<P>HE that is above informing himself
when he is in danger, is above pity
when he miscarries: a young Trades∣man
who sets up thus full of himself,
and scorning advice from those who
have gone before him, like a horse
that rushes into the battle, is only fear∣less
of danger because he does not un∣derstand
it.</P>
<P>IF there is not something extraordi∣nary
in the temper and genius of the
Tradesmen of this age, if there is not
something very singular in their, cus∣toms
<PB N="vi" REF="6"/>
and methods, their conduct and
behaviour in business; also if there is
not something different and more dan∣gerous
and fatal in the common road
of trading, and Tradesmens management
now, than ever was before, what is the
reason that there are so many Bankrupts
and broken Tradesmen now among us,
more than ever were known before?</P>
<P>I make no doubt but there is as
much trade now, and as much gotten
by trading, as there ever was in this
nation, at least in our memory; and
if we will allow other people to judge,
they will tell us there is much more
trade, and trade is much more gainful;
what then must be the reason that the
Tradesmen cannot live on their trades,
cannot keep open their shops, cannot
maintain themselves and families as well
now as they could before? Something
extraordinary must be the case.</P>
<P>THERE must be some failure in the
<HI>Tradesman,</HI> it can be no where else;
<PB N="vii" REF="7"/>
<HI>either</HI> he is less sober and less frugal,
less cautious of what he does, who he
trusts, how he lives, and how he be∣haves,
than Tradesmen use to be, <HI>or</HI> he
is less industrious, less diligent, and
takes less care and pains in his business,
or something is the matter; it cannot
be but if he had the same gain, and
but the same expence which the former
ages suffered tradesmen to thrive with,
he would certainly thrive as they did:
There must be something out of or∣der
in the foundation, he must fail in
the essential part, or he would not fail
in his trade: The same causes would
have the same effects in all ages; the
same gain, and but the same expence,
would just leave him in the same place
as it would have left his predecessor in
the same shop; and yet we see one grow
rich, and the other starve under the very
same circumstances.</P>
<P>THE temper of the times explains
the case to every body that pleases but
to look into it. The expences of a
<PB N="viii" REF="8"/>
family are quite different now from
what they have been; Tradesmen can∣not
live as Tradesmen in the same class
used to live; custom, and the manner
of all the Tradesmen round them com∣mand
a difference, and he that will
not do as others do, is esteemed as no
body among them, and the Tradesman
is doom'd to ruin by the fate of the
times.</P>
<P>IN short, there is a fate upon a Trades∣man,
either he must yield to the snare
of the times, or be the jest of the
times; the young Tradesman cannot re∣sist
it; he must live as others do, or
lose the credit of living, and be run
down as if he was broke: In a word,
he must spend more than he can afford
to spend, and so be undone, or not
spend it, and so be undone.</P>
<P>IF he lives as others do he breaks,
because he spends more than he gets; if
he does not, he breaks too, because he loses
his credit, and that is to lose his trade;
what must he do?</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="9"/>
THE following directions are cal∣culated
for this exigency, and to pre∣pare
the young Tradesman to stem the
attacks of those fatal customs, which
otherwise, if he yields to them, will
inevitably send him the way of all the
thoughtless Tradesmen, that have gone
before him.</P>
<P>HERE he will be <HI>effectually, we hope,</HI>
encourag'd to set out well, to begin
wisely and prudently, and to avoid all
those rocks which the gay race of
tradesmen so frequently suffer ship∣wrack
upon; and here he will have
a true plan of his own prosperity
drawn out for him, by which, if it
be not his own fault, he may square
his conduct in an unerring manner,
and fear neither bad fortune nor bad
friends.</P>
<P>I had purposed to give a great many
other cautions and directions in this work,
but it would have spun it out too
<PB N="x" REF="10"/>
far, and have made it tedious: I would
indeed have discoursed of some branches
of <HI>home trade,</HI> which necessarily em∣barks
the Inland Tradesman in some
parts of foreign business, and so makes
a merchant of the shop-keeper almost
whether he will or no, <HI>for example:</HI></P>
<P>ALMOST all the shop-keepers and
Inland Traders in sea-port towns, or
even in the water-side-part of <HI>London</HI>
it self, are necessarily brought in to be
owners of ships, and concerned at
least in the vessel, if not in the voy∣age;
some of their trades, perhaps,
relate to, or are employed in the
building, or fitting, or furnishing out
ships, as is the case at <HI>Shoreham,</HI>
at <HI>Ipswich, Yarmouth, Hull, Whitby,
Newcastle,</HI> and the like: Others are
concern'd in the cargoes, as in the <HI>Her∣ring
Fishery</HI> at <HI>Yarmouth</HI> and the adja∣cent
Ports, the <HI>Colliery</HI> at <HI>Newcastle,
Sunderland, &amp;c.</HI> and the like in ma∣ny
other cases.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="11"/>
IN this case the shop-keeper is some∣times
a merchant adventurer, whether
he will or not, and some of his busi∣ness
runs into sea-adventures, as in the
<HI>Salt</HI> trade at <HI>Sheffield,</HI> in <HI>Northum∣berland,</HI>
and <HI>Durham,</HI> and again at
<HI>Limington;</HI> and again in the Coal trade,
from <HI>Whitehaven</HI> in <HI>Cumberland</HI> to
<HI>Ireland,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>THESE considerations urg'd me to
direct due cautions to such Tradesmen,
and such as would be particular to
them, especially not to launch put in
adventures beyond the compass of their
stocks; and withal to manage those
things with due wariness: But this
work had not room for those things;
and as that fort of amphibious Trades∣men,
<HI>for such they are,</HI> trading both
by water and by land, are not of the
kind with those particularly aimed at in
these sheets, I thought it was better to
leave them quite out, than to touch
but lightly upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="12"/>
I had also designed one Chapter or
Letter to my <HI>Inland Tradesmen,</HI> upon
the most important subject: of <HI>borrow∣ing
money upon interest,</HI> which is one
of the most dangerous things a Trades∣man
is exposed to: It is a pleasant
thing to a Tradesman to see his credit
rise, and men offer him money to
trade with, upon so slender a conside∣ration
as 5 <HI>per cent.</HI> interest, when he
gets 10 <HI>per cent.</HI> perhaps twice in the
year; but it is a snare of the most
dangerous kind in the event, and has
been the ruin of so many Tradesmen,
that tho' I had not room for it in the
Work, I cou'd not let it pass without
this notice, <HI>in the Preface.</HI></P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. INTEREST money eats deep in∣to
the Tradesman's profits, because
it is a payment certain, whether
the Tradesman gets or loses; and
as he may often get double, so
sometimes he loses, and then his
interest is a double payment; 'tis
<PB N="xiii" REF="13"/>
a Partner with him, under this un∣happy
circumstance, <HI>viz.</HI> that it
goes halves when he <HI>gains,</HI> but not
when he <HI>loses.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THE Lender calls for his money
when he pleases, and often comes
for it when the Borrower can ill
spare it; and then, having launch'd
out in Trade on the supposition
of <HI>so much in stock,</HI> he is left to
struggle with the enlarged trade
with a contracted stock; and thus
he sinks under the weight of it,
cannot repay the money, is dis∣honoured,
prosecuted, and at last
undone by the very loan which he
took in to help him.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>INTEREST of money is a dead
weight upon the Tradesman, and as the
interest always keeps him low, the prin∣cipal
sinks him quite down, when that
comes to be paid out again. Payment
of interest, to a Tradesman, is like
<HI>Cicero</HI> bleeding to death in a warm
<PB N="xiv" REF="14"/>
Bath, the pleasing warmth of the Bath
makes him die in a kind of dream,
and not feel himself decay, till at last
he is exhausted, falls into convulsions,
and expires.</P>
<P>A Tradesman held up by <HI>money at
interest,</HI> is sure to sink at last by the
weight of it, like a man thrown into
the sea with a stone tied about his
neck, who tho' he could swim if he was
loose, he drowns in spite of all his
struggle.</P>
<P>INDEED this article would require
not a letter, but a book by it self, and
the tragical stories of Tradesmen un∣done
by usury are so many, and the
variety so great, that they would make
a history by themselves: But it must
suffice to treat it here only in general,
and give the Tradesmen a warning of
it, as the <HI>Trinity-house</HI> pilots warn sail∣ors
of a sand, by hanging a buoy up∣on
it; or as the <HI>Edy</HI> stone light-house
upon a sunk rock, which, as the Poet says,
<PB N="xv" REF="15"/>
<HI>Bids men stand off, and live; come near, and die.</HI></P>
<P>FOR a Tradesman to borrow money
upon interest, I take to be like a man
going into a house infected with the
plague; 'tis not only likely that he may
be infected and die, but next to a mi∣racle
if he escapes.</P>
<P>THIS part being thus hinted at, I
think I may say of the following sheets,
That they contain all the directions
needful to make the Tradesman thrive;
and if he pleases to listen to it with a
temper of mind willing to be directed,
he must have some uncommon ill luck
if he miscarries.</P>

Complete Tradesman.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>EING to direct this discourse to
the <HI>tradesmen</HI> of this nation, 'tis
needful, in order to make the sub∣stance
of this work and the sub∣ject
of it agree together, that I
should in a few words explain the terms, and
tell the reader who it is we understand by the
word <HI>tradesman,</HI> and how he is to be qualified
in order to merit the title of <HI>complete.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is necessary because the said term <HI>trades∣man</HI>
is understood by several people, and in se∣veral
<PB N="2" REF="19"/>
places, in a different manner: <HI>for example,</HI>
In the North of <HI>Britain,</HI> and likewise in <HI>Ire∣land,</HI>
when you say a <HI>tradesman,</HI> you are un∣derstood
to mean a mechanick, such as a <HI>smith,</HI>
a <HI>carpenter,</HI> a <HI>shoemaker,</HI> and the like, such as
here we call a <HI>handicraftsman.</HI> In like man∣ner,
abroad they call a <HI>tradesman</HI> such only as
carry goods about from town to town, and
from market to market, or from house to
house to sell; these in <HI>England</HI> we call <HI>petty
chapmen,</HI> in the North <HI>pethers,</HI> and in our or∣dinary
speech <HI>pedlars.</HI></P>
<P>BUT in <HI>England,</HI> and especially in <HI>London,</HI>
and the South part of <HI>Britain,</HI> we take it in
another sense, and in general, all sorts of ware∣housekeepers,
shopkeepers, whether wholesale
dealers, or retailers of goods, are called <HI>trades∣men;</HI>
or to explain it by another word <HI>trading
men:</HI> such are, whether wholesale or retale,
our <HI>grocers, mercers, linen</HI> and <HI>woollen drapers,</HI>
Blackwell-hall <HI>factors, tobacconists, haberdash∣ers,</HI>
whether of hats or small wares, <HI>glovers,
hosiers, milleners, booksellers, stationers,</HI> and
all other shopkeepers, who do not actually
work upon, make, or manufacture the goods
they fell.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, those who make the
goods they sell, tho' they do keep shops to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell them, are not called <HI>tradesmen,</HI> but <HI>handi∣crafts,</HI>
such as <HI>smiths, shoemakers, founders,
joiners, carpenters, carvers, turners,</HI> and the
like; others, who only make, or cause to be
made, goods for other people to sell, are cal∣led
<HI>manufacturers</HI> and <HI>artists, &amp;c.</HI> Thus di∣stinguished,
<PB N="3" REF="20"/>
I shall speak of them all as occasion
requires, raking this general explication to be
sufficient; and I thus mention it to prevent be∣ing
obliged to frequent and further particular
descriptions as I go on.</P>
<P>AS there are several degrees of people em∣ploy'd
in trade below these, such as <HI>workmen,
labourers,</HI> and <HI>servants;</HI> so there is a degree
of traders above them, which we call <HI>mer∣chants;</HI>
where 'tis needful to observe, that in
other countries, and even in the North of
<HI>Britain,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> as the handicraftsmen and
artists are call'd <HI>tradesmen,</HI> so the <HI>shopkeepers,</HI>
who we here call <HI>tradesmen,</HI> are all call'd
<HI>merchants;</HI> nay even the very <HI>pedlars</HI> are
call'd <HI>travelling merchants.</HI> But in <HI>England</HI>
the word <HI>merchant</HI> is understood of none
but such as carry on foreign correspondences,
importing the goods and growth of other
countries, and exporting the growth and ma∣nufacture
of <HI>England</HI> to other countries; or
to use a vulgar expression, because I am speak∣ing
to and of those who use that expression,
<HI>such as trade beyond sea.</HI> These, in <HI>England,</HI>
and these only, are call'd <HI>merchants,</HI> by way
of honourable distinction: These I am not
concern'd with in this work, nor is any part
of it directed to them.</P>
<P>AS the <HI>tradesmen</HI> are thus distinguish'd, and
their several occupations divided into proper
classes, so are the <HI>trades.</HI> The general com∣merce
of <HI>England,</HI> as it is the most considera∣ble
of any nation in the world, so that part
of it, which we call the <HI>home</HI> or <HI>inland trade,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="21"/>
is equal, if not superior to that of any other
nation, tho' some of those nations are infi∣nitely
greater than <HI>England,</HI> and more popu∣lous
also, as <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> in particular.</P>
<P>I insist that the trade of <HI>England</HI> is greater
and more considerable than that of any other
nation, for these reasons: (1.) Because <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
produces more goods as well for home
consumption as for foreign exportation, (and
those goods all made of its own produce or
manufactured by its own inhabitants) than any
other nation in the world. (2.) Because <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
consumes within it self more goods of
foreign growth, imported from the several coun∣tries
where they are produc'd or wrought, than
any other nation in the world. And, (3.) Be∣cause
for the doing this <HI>England</HI> employs more
shipping and more seamen, than any other
nation (and some think than all the other na∣tions)
of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>HENCE, besides the great number of weal∣thy
<HI>merchants</HI> who carry on this great foreign
negoce, and who by their corresponding with
all parts of the world, import the growth of
all countries hither; <HI>I say,</HI> besides these, we
have a very great number of considerable
dealers, whom we call <HI>tradesmen,</HI> who are pro∣perly
call'd warehousekeepers, who supply the
merchants with all the several kinds of manu∣factures,
and other goods of the produce of
<HI>England,</HI> for exportation; and also others who
are called <HI>wholesalemen,</HI> who buy and take off
from the <HI>merchants</HI> all the foreign goods
which they import; these, by their correspond∣ing
<PB N="5" REF="22"/>
with a like sort of <HI>tradesmen</HI> in the country,
convey and hand forward those goods, and our
own also, among those country <HI>tradesmen,</HI> in∣to
every corner of the kingdom, however re∣mote;
and by them to the retailers; and by
the retailer to the last consumer, which is the
last article of all trade. These are the <HI>trades∣men</HI>
understood in this work, and for whose
service these sheets are made publick.</P>
<P>HAVING thus describ'd the person, who I
understand by the <HI>English tradesman,</HI> 'tis then
needful to enquire into his qualifications, and
what it is that renders him a finish'd or <HI>complete</HI>
man in his business.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THAT he has a general knowledge of not
his own particular trade and business only;
that part indeed well denominates a handi∣craftsman
to be a <HI>complete artist;</HI> but our <HI>com∣plete
tradesman</HI> ought to understand all the in∣land
trade of <HI>England,</HI> so as to be able to
turn his hand to any thing, or deal in any
thing, or every thing, of the growth and pro∣duct
of his own country, or the manufacture
of the people, as his circumstances in trade or
other occasions may require; and may, if he sees
occasion, lay down one trade, and take up ano∣ther,
when he pleases, without serving a new
apprenticeship to learn it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THAT he not only has a knowledge of
the species or kinds of goods, but of the places
and peculiar countries where those goods,
whether product or manufacture, are to be
found; that is to say, where produc'd, or where

<ITEM>3. THAT he understands perfectly well all the
methods of correspondence, returning money
or goods for goods, to and from every coun∣ty
in <HI>England;</HI> in what manner to be done,
and in what manner most to advantage; what
goods are generally bought by barter and ex∣change,
and what by payment of money; what

<P>IN order to complete the <HI>English</HI> trades∣man
in this manner, the first thing to be done
is to lay down such general maxims of trade
as are fit for his instruction, and then to de∣scribe
the <HI>English</HI> or <HI>British</HI> product, being
the fund of its inland trade, whether we mean
its <HI>produce</HI> as the growth of the country, or
its <HI>manufactures,</HI> as the labour of her people;
then to acquaint the tradesman with the
manner of the circulation where those things
are found, how and by what methods all those
goods are brought to <HI>London,</HI> and from <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
again convey'd into the country; where
<PB N="7" REF="24"/>
they are principally bought at best hand, and
most to the advantage of the buyer, and where
the proper markets are to dispose of them again
when bought.</P>
<P>THESE are the degrees by which the <HI>complete
tradesman</HI> is brought up, and by which he is
instructed in the principles and methods of his
commerce, by which he is made, acquainted
with business, and is capable of carrying it
on with success, after which there is not a
man in the universe deserves the title of a
<HI>complete tradesman,</HI> like, the <HI>English</HI> shop∣keeper.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the TRADESMAN in his Preparations
while an Apprentice.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S you request me to write my
thoughts to you (as leisure permits)
by way of instruction to young
<HI>tradesmen,</HI> I have, in the best man∣ner
I could, obey'd your orders in
the following sheers, which I hope will answer
your end, and be useful to those young begin∣ners
in trade, who are yet to launch out into
that sea, where so many, for want of good pi∣lots,
have miscarried.</P>
<P>THE first part of a trader's beginning is ordi∣narily
very young, I mean, when he goes ap∣prentice,
and the notions of trade are scarce
got into his head; for boys go apprentices while
they are but boys; to talk to them in their first
three or four years signifies nothing; they are
rather then to be taught submission to families,
<PB N="9" REF="26"/>
and subjection to their masters, and dutiful at∣tendance
in their shops or warehouses; and this
is not our present business.</P>
<P>BUT after they have entred the fifth or sixth
year, they may then be entertain'd with dis∣courses
of another nature; and as they begin
then to look forward beyond the time of their
servitude, and think of setting up and being for
themselves, I think then is the time to put them
upon useful preparations for the work, and to
instruct them in such things as may qualify them
best to enter upon the world, and act for them∣selves
when they are so enter'd.</P>
<P>THE first thing a youth in the latter part of
his time is to do, is to endeavour to gain a good
judgment in the wares of all kinds that he
is like to deal in: The first years of his time he
of course learns, to weigh and measure either
liquids or solids, to pack up and make bales,
trusses, packs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to do the courser and
laborious part of business; but all that, gives
him little knowledge in the species of the goods,
much less a nice judgment in their value and
sorts, which however is one of the principal
things that belongs to trade.</P>
<P>IT is suppos'd that by this time, if his master
is a man of considerable business, his man is
become the eldest apprentice, and is taken from
the counter, and from sweeping the warehouse
into the compting-house, where he among other
things sees the bills of parcels of goods bought,
and thereby knows what every thing costs at first
hand, what gain, is made of them, and if a mis∣carriage
happens, he knows what loss too; by
<PB N="10" REF="27"/>
which he is led of course to look into the good∣ness
of the goods, and see the reason of things:
If the goods are not to expectation, and conse∣quently
do not answer the price, he sees the
reason of that loss, and he looks into the goods,
and sees where and how far they are deficient,
and in what; this, if he be careful to make his
observations, brings him naturally to have a good
judgment in the goods.</P>
<P>IF a young man neglects this part, and passes
over the season for such improvement, he very
rarely ever recovers it; for this part has its sea∣son,
and that more remarkable than in many o∣ther
cases, and that season lost never comes
again; a judgment in goods taken in early, is
never lost, and a judgment taken in late is sel∣dom
good.</P>
<P>IF the youth slips this occasion, and not mind∣ing
what is before him goes out of his time, with∣out
obtaining such a skill as this in the goods
he is to deal in, he enters into trade without
his most useful tools, and must use spectacles be∣fore
his time.</P>
<P>FOR want of this knowledge of the goods he
is at a loss in the buying part, and is liable to
be cheated and impos'd upon in the most noto∣rious
manner by the sharp-sighted world; for
his want of judgment is a thing that cannot be
hid; the merchants or manufacturers who he
buys of presently discover him; the very boys
in the wholesale mens warehouses and in mer∣chants
warehouses will play upon him, sell him
one thing for another, shew him a worse sort
when he calls for a better, and asking a higher
<PB N="11" REF="28"/>
price for it, persuade him it is better, and when
they have thus bubbled him, they triumph over
his ignorance when he is gone, and expose him
to the last degree.</P>
<P>BESIDES, for want of judgment in the goods
he is to buy, he often runs a hazard of being
cheated to a very great degree, and perhaps some
time or other a tradesman, may be ruin'd by it,
or at least ruin his reputation.</P>
<P>WHEN I liv'd abroad, I had once a commission
sent me from a merchant in <HI>London</HI> to buy a
large parcel of brandy: The goods were some∣thing
out of my way, having never bought any
in that country before. However, it happen'd
that I had frequently bought and imported bran∣dies
in <HI>England,</HI> and had some judgment in
them, so much that I ventur'd to buy without
taking a cooper with me, which was not usual
in that place. The first parcel of brandy I saw
was very good, and I bought freely to the value of
about 600 <HI>l.</HI> and ship'd them for <HI>England,</HI> where
they gave very good satisfaction to my employer.
But I could not compleat my commission to my
mind in that parcel: Some days after some mer∣chants,
who had seen me buy the other, and
thought me a novice in the business, and that
I took no cooper to taste the brandy, laid a
plot for me, which indeed was such a plot as I
was not in the least aware of, and had not the
little judgment which I had in the commodity
prevented, I had been notoriously abus'd. The
case was thus: They gave me notice by the same
person who help'd me to the sight of the first
brandy, that there was a cellar of extraordinary
<PB N="12" REF="29"/>
good brandy at such a place, and invited me to
see it. Accordingly I went in an afternoon,
and tasted the brandy, being a large parcel, a∣mounting
to about 460 <HI>l.</HI> sterling.</P>
<P>I liked the goods very well, but the merchant
as they call'd him, that is to say, the knave ap∣pointed
to cheat the poor stranger, was cun∣ningly
out of the way; so that no bargain was
to be made that night. But as I had said that I
lik'd the brandy, the same person who brought
me an account of them comes to my lodgings,
to treat with me about the price. We did not
make many words: I bad him the current price
which I had bought for some days before, and
after a few struggles for five crowns a ton more,
he came to my price, and his next word was to
let me know the gage of the cask, and as I had
seen the goods already, he thought there was no∣thing
to do but to make a bargain, and order the
goods to be deliver'd.</P>
<P>BUT as young as I was I was too old for that
too, but told him, I could not tell positively
how many I should take, but that I would come
in the afternoon, and taste them over again, and
mark out what I wanted. He seem'd unea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie at
that, and pretended he had two merchants wait∣ed
to see them, and he could sell them imme∣diately,
and I might do him a prejudice, if I
made him wait, and put them off who perhaps
might buy in the mean time.</P>
<P>I answer'd him coldly, I would not hinder
him selling them by any means if he could have
a better chapman, that I could not come soon∣er,
and that I would not be obliged to take the
<PB N="13" REF="30"/>
whole parcel, nor would I buy any of them with∣out
tasting them again: he argued much to have
me buy them, seeing as he said I had tasted them
before, and lik'd them very well.</P>
<P>I did so, <HI>said I,</HI> but I love to have my palate
confirm one day what it approv'd the day be∣fore.
Perhaps, <HI>says he,</HI> you would have some
other person's judgment of them, and you are
welcome to do so, Sir, with all my heart, send
any body you please; but still he urg'd for a
bargain, when the person sent should make his
report; and then he had his agents ready, as I
understood afterwards, to manage the persons I
should send.</P>
<P>I answer'd him frankly I had no great judg∣ment,
but that such as it was I ventur'd to trust
to it; I thought I had honest men to deal with,
and that I should bring no body to taste them
for me but myself.</P>
<P>THIS pleas'd him, and was what he secretly
wish'd; and now, instead of desiring me to come
immediately, he told me, that seeing I would
not buy without seeing the goods again, and
would not go just then, he could not be in the
way in the afternoon, and so desir'd I would
defer it 'till next morning, which I readily a∣greed
to.</P>
<P>IN the morning I went, but not so soon as I
had appointed; upon which, when I came, he
seem'd offended, and said I had hinder'd him;
that he could have sold the whole parcel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I
told him 1 could not have hinder'd him, for that I
had told him he should not wait for me, but sell
them to the first good customer he found. He
<PB N="14" REF="31"/>
told me, he had indeed sold two or three casks,
but he would not disoblige me so much as to sell
the whole parcel before I came. This I mention
because he made it a kind of a bite upon me,
that I should not be alarm'd at seeing the casks
displac'd in the cellar.</P>
<P>WHEN I came to taste the brandy, I began to
be surprised. I saw the very same casks which
I had touch'd with the marking-iron when I was
there before, but I did not like the brandy by
any means, but did not yet suspect the least foul
play.</P>
<P>I went round the whole cellar, and I could
not mark above three casks which I durst ven∣ture
to buy; the rest apparently shew'd them∣selves
to be mix'd, at least I thought so. I mark∣ed
out the three casks, and told him my palate
had deceived me, that the rest of the brandy
was not for my turn.</P>
<P>I saw the man surprised, and turn pale, and
at first seem'd to be very angry, that I should, as
he call'd it, disparage the goods; that sure I did
not understand brandy, and the like; and that
I should have brought somebody with me that did
understand it: I answer'd coldly, that if I ventur'd
my money upon my own judgment, the hazard
was not to the seller, but to the buyer, and no
body had to do with that; if I did not like his
goods, another, whose judgment was better, might
like them, and so there was no harm done: in
a word, he would not let me have the three
casks I had mark'd, unless I took more, and I
would take no more, so we parted, but with no
satisfaction on his side; and I afterwards came
<PB N="15" REF="32"/>
to hear that he had sate up all the night with his
coopers mixing spirits in every cask, whence
he drew off a quantity of the right brandy and
corrupted it, concluding, that as I had no judg∣ment
to chuse by but my own, I could not dis∣cover
it; and it came out by his quarrelling
with the person who brought me to him, for
telling him I did not underderstand the goods,
upon which presumption he ventur'd to spoil
the whole parcel.</P>
<P>I give you this story as a just caution to a
young tradesman, and to shew how necessary
it is that a tradesman should have judgment in
the goods he buys, and how easily he may be
impos'd upon and abus'd, if he offers to buy
upon his own judgment, when really it is de∣fective.
I could enlarge this article with many
like examples, but I think this may suffice.</P>
<P>2. THE next thing I recommend to an ap∣prentice
at the conclusion of his time, is to ac∣quaint
himself with his master's chapmen; I
mean of both kinds, as well those he sells to,
as those he buys of; and, <HI>if he is a factor,</HI> with
his master's employers. But what I aim at
now is the chapmen, and customers whom his
master chiefly sells to. I need not explain my
self not to mean by this the chance customers
of a retailer's shop, for there can be no ac∣quaintance,
or very little, made with them:
but, I mean the country shopkeepers, or o∣thers
who buy in parcels, and who buy to sell
again, or export as merchandize. If the young
man comes from his master, and has form'd no
acquaintance or interest among the customers
<PB N="16" REF="33"/>
whom his master dealt with, he has in short, slipt
or lost one of the principal ends and reasons of
his being an apprentice, in which he has spent
seven years, and perhaps his friends given a
considerable sum of money.</P>
<P>FOR a young man coming out of his time to
have his shop or warehouse stock'd with goods,
and his customers all to seek, will make his
beginning infinitely more difficult to him, than
it would otherwise be; and he not only has
new customers to seek, but has their charac∣ters
to seek also, and knows not who is good,
and who not, till he buys that knowledge by
his experience, and perhaps sometimes pays too
dear for it.</P>
<P>IT was an odd circumstance of a tradesman in
this city a few years ago, who being out of his
time, and going to solicit one of his master's
customers to trade with him, the chapman
did not so much as know him, or remember
that he had ever heard of his name, except as
he had heard his master call his apprentice <HI>Ja∣cob.</HI>
I know some masters diligently watch to
prevent their apprentices speaking to their cus∣tomers,
and to keep them from acquainting
themselves with the buyers, that when they
come out of their times they may not carry the
trade away with them. This method has more
cunning than honesty in it, and the master can
ill answer such a practice to his conscience:
But as the master is, <HI>to be sure,</HI> no fool that
does so, the apprentice must be no witch, that
does not countermine it, and prevent him.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="34"/>
TO hinder an apprentice from an acquaint∣ance
with the dealers of both sorts, is some∣what
like <HI>Laban</HI>'s usage of <HI>Jacob, viz.</HI> keep∣ing
back the beloved <HI>Rachel,</HI> whom he served
his seven years time for, and putting him off
with a blear-ey'd <HI>Leah</HI> in her stead; it is indeed
a kind of robbing him, taking from him the ad∣vantage
which he serv'd his time for, and send∣ing
him into the world like a man out of a
ship set on more among savages, who instead
of feeding him, are indeed more ready to eat
him up and devour him.</P>
<P>AN apprentice who has serv'd out his time
faithfully and diligently, ought to claim it
as a debt to his indentures, that his master
should let him into an open, acquaintance with
his customers; he does not else perform his
promise to teach him the art and mystery of his
trade; he does not make him master of his
business, or enable him as he ought to set up
in the world; for as buying is indeed the first,
so selling is the last end of trade, and the
faithful apprentice ought to be fully made ac∣quainted
with them both.</P>
<P>3. NEXT to being acquainted with his master's
customers and chapmen, the apprentice, when
his time is near expiring, ought to acquaint
himself with the books; that is to say, to see
and learn his master's method of book-keeping,
that he may follow it, if the method is good,
and may learn a better method <HI>in time</HI> if it is
not.</P>
<P>THE tradesman should not be at a loss how
to keep his books, when he is to begin his trade;
<PB N="18" REF="35"/>
that would be to put him to school when he is
just come from school; his apprenticeship is, <HI>and
ought in injustice to be,</HI> a school to him, where
he ought to learn every thing that should qua∣lify
him for his business, at least every thing
that his master can teach him; and if he finds
his master either backward or unwilling to
reach him, he should complain in time to his
own friends, that they may some how or other
supply the defect.</P>
<P>A tradesman's books are his repeating clook;
which upon all occasions are to tell him how
he goes on, and how things stand with him in
the world; there he will know when 'tis time
to go on, or when 'tis time to give over: and
upon his regular keeping, and fully acquainting
himself with his books, depends at least the com∣fort
of his trade, if not the very trade it self.
If they are not duly posted, and if every thing
is not carefully entred in them, the debtors ac∣counts
kept even, the cash constantly balanc'd,
and the credits all stated, the tradesman is like
a ship at sea, steer'd without a helm; he is all
in confusion, and knows not what he does, or
where he is; he may be a rich man, or a bank∣rupt,
for in a word, he can give no account of
himself to himself, much less to any body else.</P>
<P>HIS books being so essential to his trade, he
that comes out of his time without a perfect
knowledge of the method of book-keeping,
<HI>like a bride undrest,</HI> is not fit to be married;
he knows not what to do, or what step to take;
he may indeed have serv'd his time, but he has
not learn'd his trade, nor is he fit to set up;
<PB N="19" REF="36"/>
and be the fault in himself for not learning, or
in his master for not reaching him, he ought
not to set up till he has gotten some skilful
person to put him in a way to do it, and make
him fully to understand it.</P>
<P>It is true, there is not a great deal of diffi∣culty
in keeping a tradesman's books, especially
if he be a retailer only; but yet even in the
meanest trades, they ought to know how to
keep books: But the advice is directed to those
who are above the retailer, as well as to them;
if the book-keeping be small, 'tis the sooner
learned, and the apprentice is the more to blame
if he neglects it: Besides, the objection is much
more trifling than the advice: The tradesman
cannot carry on any considerable trade without
books; and he must, during his apprenticeship,
prepare himself for business by acquainting him∣self
with every thing needful for his going on
with his trade, among which that of book∣keeping
is absolutely necessary.</P>
<P>4. THE last article, and in its self essential
to a young tradesman, is to know how to buy;
if his master is kind and generous, he will con∣sider
the justice of this part, and let him into the
secret of it of his own free will, and that before
his time is fully expir'd; but if that should not
happen, as often it does not, let the apprentice
know, that it is one of the most needful things
to him that can belong to his apprenticeship,
and that he ought not to let his time run over
his head, without getting as much insight into
it as possible; that therefore he ought to lose
no opportunity to get into it, even whether
<PB N="20" REF="37"/>
his master approves of it or no; for as it is a
debt due to him from his master to instruct him
in it, 'tis highly just he should use all proper
means to come at it.</P>
<P>INDEED the affair in this age between mas∣ters
and their apprentices, stands in a different
view from what the same thing was a few years
past; the state of our apprenticeship is not a
state of servitude now, and hardly of subjection,
and their behaviour is accordingly, more like
gentlemen than tradesmen; more like compa∣nions
to their masters, than like servants. On
the other hand, the masters seem to have made
over their authority to their apprentices for a
sum of money; the money taken now with ap∣prentices
being most exorbitantly grear, com∣pair'd
to what it was in former times.</P>
<P>NOW tho' this does not at all exempt the ser∣vant
or apprentice from taking care of himself,
and to qualify himself for business while he is
an apprentice, yet it is evident that it is no
furtherance to apprentices; the liberties they take
towards the conclusion of their time, are so
much employ'd to worse purposes, that appren∣tices
do not come out of their times better
finish'd for business and trade than they did for∣merly,
but much the worse: and tho' it is not
the proper business and design of this work to
enlarge on the injustice done both to master and
servant by this change of custom, yet to bring
it to my present purpose, it carries this force
with it, namely, that the advice to apprentices
to endeavour to finish themselves for business
during the time of the indenture, is so much
the more needful and seasonable.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="38"/>
NOR is this advice for the service of the master, but of the apprentice; for if the apprentice neglects this advice, if he omits to qualify
himself for business as above; if he neither will ac∣quaint
himself with the customers, or the books,
or with the buying part, or gain judgment in
the wares he is to deal in, the loss is his own,
not his master's; and indeed he may be said to
have serv'd not himself, but his master; and both
his money and his seven years are all thrown away.</P>
<P>NAY, one way 'tis the master's advantage to
have his servant be good for nothing, the less
injury he does his master at his going away;
tho' an honest master will not desire an advan∣tage
at such a price to his apprentice: But if
this was really always the case, it would still
strengthen the argument; for so much more
ought the apprentice to take care of himself,
and qualify himself while he is with his master,
that at his coming away he may do him all the
lawful mischief he can.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Tradesman's writing Letters.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> HAVE the favour of your letter of the
fifth instant, wherein you acquaint me
with your design of publishing some ob∣servations,
rules, and instructions for the benefit
<PB N="22" REF="39"/>
of the <HI>English</HI> tradesman, and in order to in∣form
young tradesmen in the most necessary parts
of business, and the manner and method of our
<HI>English</HI> inland-trade, desiring me to give you
my thoughts on the subject, and to add any
thing, which in my opinion may be useful in
the said work you are upon.</P>
<P>AS I perfectly well understand your meaning,
approve the design, and believe it to be both use∣ful
in itself, and very much wanted in this age,
when there are so many raw untaught wretches,
who thrust themselves into business, and know
little or nothing of it; so I shall not fail to con∣tribute
every thing to your assistance in so good
a design, that m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> capacity and experience fur∣nishes
me with, and that I think may promote
the work.</P>
<P>IN order to oblige you in every part of your
request, I shall desire you to take notice, that as
one great defect of our tradesmen is their not
knowing how to write their letters of corre∣spondence
in a free, plain, and tradesman-like
stile, and to give or receive orders in terms suit∣able
to the nature of the thing they write about,
I shall, as near as I can, put all my letters into
such a form, and choose such a stile, even in
these letters to you, as shall? <HI>mutatis mutandis</HI>
be some direction to <HI>the complete tradesman</HI>
in the stile and manner of his writing; and if
this should take up some of my first letters to
you, I hope you will not think them misplac'd,
seeing it is one of the first things a tradesman
ought to be master of.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="40"/>
AS plainness and a free unconstrain'd way of
speaking is the beauty and excellence of speech,
so an easie free concise way of writing is the
best stile for a tradesman. He that affects a
rumbling and bombast stile, and fills his letters
with long harangues, compliments, and flou∣rishes,
should turn poet instead of tradesman,
and set up for a wit, not a shopkeeper. Hark
how such a young tradesman writes out of
the country to his wholesale man at <HI>London</HI> upon
his first setting up.</P>
<P>“SIR, The destinies having so appointed it,
and my dark stars concurring, that I, who by
nature was fram'd for better things, should be
put out to a trade, and the gods having been
so propitious to me in the time of my servi∣tude,
that at length the days are expir'd, and
I am launch'd forth into the great ocean of
business, I thought fit to acquaint you, that
last month I receiv'd my fortune, which by
my father's will had been my due two years
past, at which time I arriv'd to man's estate,
and became major; whereupon I have taken
a house in one of the principal streets of the
town of—where I am entred upon
my business, and hereby let you know that
I shall have occasion for the goods hereafter
mention'd, which you may send to me by the
carrier.”</P>
<P>THIS fine flourish, and which no doubt the
young fellow drest up with much application,
and thought was very well done, put his cor∣respondent
<PB N="24" REF="41"/>
in <HI>London</HI> into a fit of laughter, and
instead of sending him the goods he wrote for,
put him either first upon writing down into the
country to enquire after his character, and whe∣ther
he was worth dealing with, or else it ob∣tain'd
to be fil'd up among such letters as deserv'd
no answer.</P>
<P>THE same tradesman at <HI>London</HI> receiv'd by
the post another letter from a young shop-keeper
in the country to the purpose following.</P>
<P>“BEING obliged, Sir, by my late master's de∣cease
to enter immediately upon his business,
and consequently open my shop without com∣ing
up to <HI>London</HI> to furnish myself with such
goods as at present I want, I have here sent
you a small order, as underwritten, I hope
you will think yourself obliged to use me
well, and particularly that the goods may be
good of the sorts, tho' I cannot be at <HI>London</HI>
to look them out myself. I have enclosed
a bill of exchange for 75 <HI>l.</HI> on mess<SUP>rs</SUP>. <HI>A</HI>—
and <HI>B</HI>—and company, payable to you or
your order at one and twenty days sight; be
pleased to get it accepted, and if the goods
amount to more than that sum, I shall, when
I have your bill of parcels, send you the re∣mainder.
I repeat my desire, that you will
send me the goods well sorted, and well cho∣sen,
and as cheap as possible, that I may be
encourag'd to a farther correspondence.”</P>

<P>THIS was writing like a man that understood
what he was doing; and his correspondent in
<HI>London</HI> would presently say, this young man
writes like a man of business; pray let us take
care to use him well, for in all probability he
will be a very good chapman.</P>
<P>THE sum of the matter is this; a tradesman's
letters should be plain, concise, and to the pur∣pose;
no quaint expressions, no book-phrases,
no flourishes, and yet they must be full and suf∣ficient
to express what he means, so as not to
be doubtful, much less unintelligible. I can by
no means approve of studied abbreviations, and
leaving out the needful copulatives of speech
in trading letters, they are <HI>to an extreme</HI> affect∣ed,
no beauty to the stile, but on the contrary
a deformity of the grossest nature. They are
affected to the last degree, and with this aggra∣vation,
that it is an affectation of the grossest
nature; for in a word 'tis affecting to be thought
a man of more than ordinary sense, by writing
extraordinary nonsense; and affecting to be a
man of business by giving orders and expressing
your meaning in terms which a man of business
may not think himself bound by: for example,
a tradesman at <HI>Hull</HI> writes to his correspondent
at <HI>London</HI> the following letter.</P>
<P>“SIR, yours receiv'd, have at present little
to reply. Last post you had bills of loading
with invoyce of what had loaden for your
account in <HI>Hambro'</HI> factor bound for said
port. What have farther orders for shall be
dispatch'd with expedition. Markets slacken
<PB N="26" REF="43"/>
much on this side, cannot sell the iron for
more than 37 <HI>s.</HI> wish had your orders if shall
part with it at that rate. No ships since the
11<SUP>th</SUP>. <HI>London</HI> fleet may be in the roads be∣fore
the late storm, so hope they are safe: if
have not ensur'd, please omit the same 'till
hear farther; the weather proving good, hope
the danger is over.”</P>
<P>“MY last transmitted three bills exchange,
import <HI>l.</HI> 315. please signify if are come to
hand, and accepted, and give credit in account
current to”</P>
<CLOSER>Your humble Servant.</CLOSER>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<P>I pretend to say there is nothing in all this letter,
tho' appearing to have the face of a considerable
dealer, but what may be taken any way <HI>pro</HI> or <HI>con.</HI>
The <HI>Hambro'</HI> factor may be a ship, or a horse,
be bound to <HI>Hambro',</HI> or <HI>London.</HI> What shall be
dispatch'd may be one thing, or any thing, or
every thing in a former letter. No ships since
the 11<SUP>th</SUP> may be, no ships come in, or no ships
gone out. The <HI>London</HI> fleet being in the roads,
it may be <HI>London</HI>-fleet from <HI>Hull</HI> to <HI>London,</HI>
or from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Hull,</HI> both being often at
sea together. The roads may be <HI>Yarmouth</HI> roads
or <HI>Grimsby,</HI> or indeed any where.</P>
<P>BY such a way of writing no orders can be
binding to him that gives them, or to him they
are given to. A merchant writes to his factor
at <HI>Lisbon;</HI></P>
<P>“PLEASE to send <HI>per</HI> first ship 150 chests best
<HI>Seville,</HI> and 200 pipes best <HI>Lisbon</HI> white.
<PB N="27" REF="44"/>
May value yourself <HI>per</HI> exchange 1250 <HI>l.</HI> ster∣ling
for the account of above orders. Sup∣pose
you can send the sloop to <HI>Seville</HI> for
the order'd chests, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<CLOSER>I am</CLOSER>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<P>HERE is the order to send a cargo, with a
<HI>please to send;</HI> so the factor may let it alone if
he does not please. The order is 150 chests <HI>Se∣ville;</HI>
'tis supposed he means oranges, but it
may be 150 chests orange-trees as well, or chests
of oil, or any thing. <HI>Lisbon</HI> white may be
wine, or any thing else, tho' 'tis suppos'd to be
wine. He may draw 1250 <HI>l.</HI> but he may refuse
to accept it if he pleases, for any thing such an
order as that obliges him.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, orders ought to he plain and
explicit, and he ought to have assur'd him, that
on his drawing on him his bills should be ho∣nour'd,
that is, accepted and paid.</P>
<P>I know this affectation of stile is accounted
very grand, looks modish, and has a kind of
majestick greatness in it; but the best merchants
in the world are come off from it, and now
choose to write plain and intelligibly; much
less should country-tradesmen, citizens and shop∣keepers,
whose business is plainness and meer
trade, make use of it.</P>
<P>I have mentioned this in the beginning of this
work, because indeed it is the beginning of a
tradesman's business. When a tradesman takes
an apprentice, the first thing he does for him,
after he takes him from behind his counter, af∣ter
he lets him into his compting-house and
<PB N="28" REF="45"/>
his books, and after trusting him with his more
private business, I say the first thing is to let
him write letters to his dealers, and correspond
with his friends; and this he does in his mas∣ter's
name, subscribing his letters thus:</P>
<CLOSER><HI>I am,
for my master.</HI> A. B. and company,
<HI>your humble servant,</HI>
<SIGNED>C. D.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<Q>And beginning thus:</Q>
<P>SIR, I am order'd by my master <HI>A. B.</HI> to
advise you that—
Or thus:</P>
<P>SIR, By my master's order, I am to signify
to you that—
Or thus:</P>
<P>SIR, These are by my master's order to give
you notice—</P>
<P>ORDERS for goods ought to be very explicit
and particular, that the dealer may not mistake,
especially if it be orders from a tradesman to
a manufacturer, to make goods, or to buy goods,
either of such a quality, or to such a pattern;
in which if the goods are made to the colours,
and of a marketable goodness, and within the
time limited, the person ordering them can∣not
refuse to receive them, and make himself
debtor to the maker. On the contrary, if the
goods are not of a marketable goodness, or
not to the patterns, or are not sent within the
time, the maker ought not to expect they should
be receiv'd. For example:</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="46"/>
The tradesman, or warehouseman, or what
else we may call him, writes to his correspon∣dent
at the <HI>Devize</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> thus:</P>
<P>“SIR, The goods you sent me last week
are not at all for my purpose, being of a
sort which I am at present full of: however,
if you are willing they should lie here, I
will take all opportunities to sell them for
your account; otherwise, on your first orders
they shall be deliver'd to whoever you shall
direct: and as you had no orders from me
for such sorts of goods, you cannot take
this ill. But I have here enclosed sent you
five patterns as under markt, 1 to 5, if you
think fit to make me fifty pieces of druggets
of the same weight and goodness with the
fifty pieces, N. A. B. which I had from
you last <HI>October,</HI> and mixt as exactly as you
can to the enclosed patterns, ten to each
pattern, and can have the same to be deli∣vered
here any time in <HI>February</HI> next, I shall
take them at the same price which I gave you
for the last; and one month after the deli∣very
you may draw upon me for the money,
which shall be paid to your content.”</P>
<CLOSER>Your friend and servant.</CLOSER>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<P>“<HI>P. S.</HI> Let roe have your return <HI>per</HI> next
post, intimating that you can or cannot an∣swer
this order, that I may govern my self
accordingly.”</P>
<P>TO Mr. <HI>H. G.</HI> clothier in the <HI>Devize.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="47"/>
THE clothier accordingly gives him an answer
the next post, as follows:</P>
<P>“SIR, I have the favour of yours of the
22<SUP>d</SUP> past, with your order for fifty fine drug∣gets,
to be made of the like weight and
goodness with the two packs, N<SUP>o</SUP> A. B. which
I made for you and sent last <HI>October,</HI> as also
the five patterns enclosed, marked 1 to 5, for
my direction in the mixture: I give you this
trouble, according to your order, to let you
know, I have already put the said fifty pieces
in hand, and as I am always willing to serve
you to the best of my power, and am thank∣ful
for your favours, you may depend upon
them within the time, that is to say, some
time in <HI>February</HI> next, and that they shall be
of the like fineness and substance with the
other, and as near to the patterns as possible:
But in regard our poor are very craving, and
money at this time very scarce, I beg you
will give me leave, (twenty or thirty pieces
of them being finish'd and deliver'd to you
at any time before the remainder,) to draw
fifty pounds on you for present occasion; for
which I shall think my self greatly oblig'd,
and shall give you any security you please
that the rest shall follow within the time.”</P>
<P>“AS to the pack of goods in your hands,
which were sent up without your order, I am
content they remain in your hands for sale
on my account, and desire you will sell them
as soon as you, can for my best advantage.</P>
<CLOSER><HI>I am,</HI> &amp;c.</CLOSER>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<PB N="31" REF="48"/>
<P>HERE is a harmony of business, and every
thing exact; the order is given plain and express;
the clothier answers directly to every point:
here can be no defect in the correspondence;
the diligent clothier applies immediately to the
work, sorts and dies his wool, mixes his colours
to the patterns, puts the wool to the spinners, sends
his yarn to the weavers, has the pieces brought
home, then has them to the thicking or fulling∣mill,
dresses them in his own workhouse, and
sends them up punctually by the time; perhaps
by the middle of the month: Having sent up
twenty pieces five weeks before, the ware∣housekeeper
to oblige him, pays his bill of 50 <HI>l.</HI>
and a month after the rest are sent in, he draws
for the rest of the money, and his bills are
punctually paid. The consequence of this ex∣act
writing and answering is this.</P>
<P>The warehousekeeper having the order from
his merchant, is furnisht in time, and obliges
his customer; then says he to his servant, Well,
“this <HI>H. G.</HI> of the <HI>Devize</HI> is a clever work∣man,
understands his business, and may be
depended on: I see if I have an order to
give that requires any exactness and honest
usage, he is my man; he understands orders
when they are sent, goes to work immedi∣ately,
and answers them punctually.”</P>
<P>Again, the clothier at <HI>Devize</HI> says to his head
man, or perhaps his son, “This Mr. <HI>H.</HI> is a very
good employer, he is worth obliging; his orders
are so plain and so direct a man cannot mis∣take,
and if the goods are made honestly
and to his time, there's one's money; bills
<PB N="32" REF="49"/>
are chearfully accepted, and punctually paid;
I'll never disappoint him, whoever goes with∣out
goods he shall not.”</P>
<P>On the contrary, when orders are darkly
given, they are doubtfully observed; and when
the goods come to town, the merchant dislikes
them, the warehouseman shuffles 'em back up∣on
the clothier, to lie for his account, pretend∣ing,
they are not made to his order; the clothier is
discouraged, and for want of his money discre∣dited,
and all their correspondence is confusion,
and ends in loss both of money and credit.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Trading Stile.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N my last I gave you my thoughts for
the instruction of young tradesmen in
writing letters with orders, and answer∣ing
orders, and especially about the proper stile
of a tradesman's letters, which I hinted should
be plain and easy, free in language, and direct
to the purpose intended; give me leave to go
on with the subject a little farther, as I think
'tis useful in another part of the tradesman's cor∣respondence.</P>
<P>I might have made some apology to you for
urging tradesmen to write a plain and easy
stile; let me add to you, that the tradesmen
need not be offended at my condemning them.
<PB N="33" REF="50"/>
<HI>as it were</HI> to a plain and homely stile; easy,
plain, and familiar language is the beauty of
speech in general, and is the excellency of all
writing, on whatever subject, or to whatever
persons they are we write or speak. The end of
speech is that men might understand one ano∣ther's
meaning; certainly that speech, or that
way of speaking which is most easily under∣stood,
is the best way of speaking. If any man
was to ask me, which would be supposed to be
a perfect stile, or language, I would answer,
that in which a man speaking to five hundred
people, of all common and various capacities,
idiots or lunaticks excepted, should be under∣stood
by them all in the same manner with
one another, and in the same sense which the
speaker intended to be understood, this would
certainly be a most perfect stile.</P>
<P>ALL exotic sayings, dark and ambiguous speak∣ings,
affected words, and as I said in my last,
abridgment, or words cut off, as they are fool∣ish
and improper in business, so indeed are
they in any other things; hard words and af∣fectation
of stile in business, is like bombast in
poetry, a kind of rumbling nonsense, and no∣thing
of the kind can be more ridiculous.</P>
<P>THE nicety of writing in business, consists
chiefly, in giving every species of goods their
trading names; for there are certain peculiari∣ties
in the trading language, which are to be
observ'd as the greatest proprieties, and without
which the language your letters are written in
would be obscure, and the tradesmen you wrire
to would not understand you; for example, if
<PB N="34" REF="51"/>
you write to your factor at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> or at <HI>Cadiz,</HI>
to make your returns in <HI>hard ware,</HI> he under∣stands
you, and sends you so many bags of
pieces of eight. So if a merchant comes to
me to hire a small ship of me, and tells me
'tis for the pipin trade; or to buy a vessel, and
tells me he intends to make a <HI>pipiner</HI> of her,
the meaning is, that she is to run to <HI>Seville</HI>
for oranges, or to <HI>Malaga</HI> for lemons. If
he says he intends to send her for a lading
of fruit, the meaning is, she is to go to <HI>Ali∣cant,
Denia,</HI> or <HI>Xevia,</HI> on the coast of <HI>Spain,</HI>
for raisins of the sun, or to <HI>Malaga</HI> for <HI>Mala∣ga</HI>
raisins. Thus in the home trade in <HI>England,</HI>
if in <HI>Kent</HI> a man tells me he is to go among
the <HI>night riders,</HI> his meaning is he is to go a
carrying wool to the sea-shore; the people that
usually run the wool off in boats, are called
<HI>owlers;</HI> those that steal customs, smugglers;
and the like. In a word, there is a kind of
a cant in trade, which a tradesman ought to
know, as the beggars and strollers know the
gypsy cant, which none can speak but them∣selves;
and this in letters of business is allow∣able,
and indeed they cannot understand one
another without it.</P>
<P>A brickmaker being hired by a brewer to
make some bricks for him at his country-house,
wrote to the brewer that he could not go for∣ward
unless he had two or three load of <HI>spa∣nish;</HI>
and that otherwise his bricks would cost
him six or seven chaldron of coals extraordi∣nary,
and the bricks would not be so good and
hard neither by a great deal, when, they were
burnt.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="52"/>
THE brewer sends him an answer, that he
should go on as well as he could for three or
four days, and then the <HI>spanish</HI> should be sent
him: accordingly, the following week the
brewer sends him down, two carts loaded with
about twelve hogsheads or casks of <HI>molasses;</HI>
which frighted the brickmaker almost out of
his senses. The case was this, the brewers for∣merly
mixt <HI>molasses</HI> with their ale, to sweeten
it, and abate the quantity of malt, <HI>molasses</HI> be∣ing
at that time much cheaper, in proportion;
and this they call'd <HI>spanish,</HI> not being willing
that people should know it. Again, the brick∣makers
all about <HI>London,</HI> do mix sea-coal∣ashes,
or laystal-stuff, as we call it, with their
clay of which they make brick, and by that
shift save eight chaldron of coals out of ele∣ven,
in proportion to what other people use
to burn them with; and these ashes they call
<HI>spanish.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the receiv'd terms of art in every par∣ticular
business are to be observed; of which I
shall speak to you in its turn: I name them
here to intimate, that when I am speaking of
plain writing in matters of business, it must be
understood with an allowance for all these
things: and a tradesman must be not only al∣lowed
to use them in his stile, but cannot
write proper without them; it is a particular
excellence in a tradesman to be able to know
all the terms of art in every separate business,
so as to be able to speak or write to any par∣ticular
handicraft or manufacturer in his own
dialect; and it is as neccssary as it is for a sea∣man
<PB N="36" REF="53"/>
to understand the names of all the several
things belonging to a ship.</P>
<P>THIS therefore is not to be understood when
I say that a tradesman should write plain and
explicit, for these things belong to, and are part
of the language of trade.</P>
<P>BUT even these terms of art, or customary
expressions, are not to be used with affectation,
and with a needless repetition, where they are
not called for.</P>
<P>NOR should a tradesman write those <HI>out of
the way</HI> words, tho' 'tis in the way of the busi∣ness
he writes about, to any other person, who
he knows, or has reason to believe, does not
understand them; I say, he ought not to write
in those terms to such, because it shews a kind
of ostentation, and a triumph over the ignorance
of the person they are written to, unless at the
very same time you add an explanation of the
terms, so as to make them assuredly intelligible
at the place, and to the person to whom they
are sent.</P>
<P>A tradesman, in such cases, like a parson,
should suit his language to his auditory; and it
would be as ridiculous for a tradesman to write
a letter fill'd with the peculiarities of this or
that particular trade, which trade he knows the
person he writes to is ignorant of, and the
terms whereof he is unacquainted with, as it
would be for a minister to quote <HI>Chrysostome</HI>
and St. <HI>Austin,</HI> and repeat at large all their
sayings in the <HI>Greek</HI> and the <HI>Latin,</HI> in a coun∣try
church among a parcel of plowmen and far∣mers.
Thus a sailor writing a letter to a sur∣geon,
<PB N="37" REF="54"/>
told him he had a swelling on the North∣East
side of his face, that his windward leg be∣ing
hurt by a bruise, it so put him out of trim
that he always heel'd to starboard when he made
fresh way, and so run to leeward till he was
often, forced aground; then he desired him to
give him some directions how to put himself
into a sailing posture again. Of all which the
surgeon understood little more than that he
had a swelling on his face, and a bruise in his
leg.</P>
<P>IT would be a very happy thing, if tradesmen
had all their <HI>lexicon technicum</HI> at their fingers
ends; I mean, (for pray remember that <HI>I ob∣serve
my own rule,</HI> not to use <HI>a hard word with∣out
explaining it,</HI>) that every tradesman would
study so the terms of art of other trades, that
he might be able to speak to every manufacturer
or artist in his own language, and understand
them when they talk'd one to another; this
would make trade be a kind of universal lan∣guage,
and the particular marks they are oblig'd
to, would be like the notes of music, an uni∣versal
character, in which all the tradesmen in
<HI>England</HI> might write to one another in the
language and characters of their several trades,
and be as intelligible to one another as the
minister is to his people, <HI>and perhaps much
more.</HI></P>
<P>I therefore recommend it to every young
tradesman to take all occasions to converse with
mechanicks of every kind, and to learn the
particular language of their business; not the
names of their tools only, and the way of
<PB N="38" REF="55"/>
working with their instruments as well as hands;
but the very cant of their trade, for every trade
has its <HI>nostrums,</HI> and its little made words,
which they often pride themselves in, and
which yet are useful to them on some occasion
or other.</P>
<P>THERE are many advantages to a tradesman
in thus having a general knowledge of the
terms of art, and the cant, as I call it, of every
business; and particularly this, that they could
not be imposed upon to easily by other trades∣men,
when they came to deal with them.</P>
<P>IF you come to deal with a tradesman or
handicraftsman, and talk his own language to
him, he presently supposes you understand his
business; that you know what you come about;
that you have judgment in his goods, or in his
art, and cannot easily be impos'd upon; accord∣ingly
he treats you like a man that is not to
be cheated, comes close to the point, and does
not croud you with words, and rattling talk to
set out his wares, and to cover their defects;
he finds you know where to look or feel for
the defect of things, and how to judge of their
worth. For example:</P>
<P>What trade has more hard words and pecu∣liar
ways attending it, than that of a jockey, or
horse-courser, as we call them? have they all the
parts of the horse, and all the diseases attend∣ing
him, neccssary to be mentioned in the mar∣ket
upon every occasion of buying or bargain∣ing:
A jockey will know you at first sight, when
you do but go round a horse, or at the first
word you say about him, whether you are a
<PB N="39" REF="56"/>
dealer, as they call themselves, or a stranger. If
you begin well, if you take up the horse's foot
right, if you handle him in the proper places,
if you bid his servant open his mouth, or go
about it your self like a workman, if you speak
of his shapes or goings in the proper words;
O, says the jockey to his fellow, he understands
a horse, he speaks the language; then he knows
you are not to be cheated, or at least not so ea∣sily:
but if you go aukwardly to work, whisper
to your man you bring with you, to ask every
thing for you, cannot handle the horse your
self, or speak the language of the trade, he falls
upon you with his flourishes, and with a flux
of horse-rhetorick imposes upon you with oaths
and asseverations, and, in a word, conquers you
with the meer clamour of his trade.</P>
<P>THUS if you go to a garden to buy flowers,
plants, trees and greens, if you know what you
go about, know the names of flowers, or sim∣ples,
or greens; know the particular beauties
of them, when they are fit to remove, and
when to slip and draw, and when not; what
colour is ordinary, and what rare; when a
flower is rare, and when ordinary; the gardener
presently talks to you as to a man of art, tells
you that you are a lover of art, a friend to a
florist, shews you his exoticks, his green-house,
and his stores; what he has set out, and what
he has budded or inarch'd, and the like: but if
he finds you have none of the terms of art,
know little or nothing of the names of plants,
or the nature of planting, he picks your pocket
instantly, shews you a fine trimm'd fuz-bush for a
<PB N="40" REF="57"/>
juniper, sells you common pinks for painted
ladies, an ordinary tulip for a rarity, and the
like: Thus I saw a gardener sell a gentleman
a large yellow auriculas, that is to say, <HI>a run∣ning
away,</HI> for a curious flower, and take a great
price; it seems the gentleman was a lover of a
good yellow, and 'tis known that when nature
in the auricula is exhausted, and has spent her
strength in shewing a fine flower, perhaps some
years upon the same root, she faints at last, and
then turns into a yellow, which yellow shall be
bright and pleasant the first year, and look ve∣ry
well to one that knows nothing of it, tho'
another year it turns pale, and at length almost
white: This the gardeners call a run flower,
and this they put upon the gentleman for a
rarity, only because he discover'd at his coming
that he knew nothing of the matter. The same
gardener sold another person a root of white
painted thyme for the right <HI>Marum Syriacum,</HI>
and thus they do every day.</P>
<P>A person goes into a brickmaker's field to
view his clamp, and buy a load of bricks; he
resolves to see them loaded because he would
have good ones; but not understanding the
goods, and seeing the workmen loading them
where they were hard and well burnt, but look'd
white and grey, which to be sure were the best
of the bricks, and which perhaps they would
not have done if he had not been there to look
on them, they supposing he understood which
were the best; but he in the abundance of his
ignorance finds fault with them, because they
were not a good colour, and did not look red,
<PB N="41" REF="58"/>
the brickmaker's men took the hint immediately,
and telling the buyer they would give him red
bricks to oblige him, turn'd their hands from
the grey hard well-burnt bricks to the soft<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sammell</HI> is a term of art the brick-makers use for those bricks which are not well-burnt, and which generally look of a pale red colour, and as fair as the other, but are soft.</NOTE> <HI>sam∣mell</HI>
half-burnt bricks, which they were glad to
dispose of, and which no body that had under∣stood
them, would have taken off their hands.</P>
<P>I mention these lower things, because I would
suit my writing to the understanding of the
meanest people, and speak of frauds used in the
most ordinary trades; but it is the like in al∣most
all the goods a tradesman can deal in. If
you go to <HI>Warwickshire</HI> to buy cheese, you de∣mand
the cheese of the first make, because that
is the best. If you go to <HI>Suffolk</HI> to buy butter,
you refuse the butter of the first make, because
that is not the best, but you bargain for the right
rowing butter, which is the butter that is made
when the cows are turn'd into the grounds where
the grass has been mow'd, and the hay carried
off, and grown again, and so in many other
cases; These things demonstrate the advantages
there are to a tradesman, in his being thoroughly
inform'd of the terms of art, and the peculiari∣ties
belonging to every particular business, which
therefore I call the language of trade.</P>
<P>AS a merchant should understand all langua∣ges,
at least, the languages of those countries
which he trades to, or corresponds with, and
<PB N="42" REF="59"/>
the customs and usages of those countries as to
their commerce; so an <HI>English</HI> tradesman ought
to understand all the languages of trade, within
the circumference of his own country at least,
and particularly of such, as he may by any of
the consequences of his commerce, come to be
any way concern'd with.</P>
<P>ESPECIALLY it is his business to acquaint him∣self
with the terms and trading stile, as I call it,
of those trades which he buys of; as to those
he sells to, supposing he sells to those who sell
again, 'tis their business to understand him, not
his to understand them; and if he finds they do
not understand him, he will not fail to make
their ignorance be his advantage, unless he is
honester and more conscientious in his dealings
than most of the tradesmen of this age seem
to be.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Tradesman acquainting himself with
all business in general.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> AM very glad that what I have written
you in my former letters, for the instru∣ction
of young tradesmen, suits your de∣sign.
I have, according to your request, persued
the subject in another letter, which I hope will
be equally to your satisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="60"/>
IT is the judgment of some experienced trades∣men,
that no man ought to go from one busi∣ness
to another, and launch out of the trade or
employment he was bred to; <HI>Tractent fabrilia
fabri,</HI> Every man to his own business: and they
tell us men never thrive when they do so.</P>
<P>I will not enter into that dispute here. I
know some very good and encouraging exam∣ples
of the contrary, and which stand as re∣markable
instances, or as exceptions to the ge∣neral
rule: But let that be as it will; sometimes
providence eminently calls men out of one em∣ploy
into another, out of a shop into a ware∣house,
out of a warehouse into a shop, out of
a single hand into a partnership, and the like;
and they trade one time here, another time
there, and with very good success too. But I
say, be that as it will, a tradesman ought so
far to acquaint himself with buisiness, that he
should not be at a loss to turn his hand to this
or that trade, as occasion presents, whether in
or out of the way of his ordinary dealing, as we
have often seen done in <HI>London</HI> and other pla∣ces,
and sometimes with good success.</P>
<P>THIS acquainting himself with business does
not intimate that he should learn every trade, or
enter into the mystery of every employment;
that cannot well be; but that he should have a
true notion of business in general, and a know∣ledge
how and in what manner it is carried on;
that he should know where every manufacture
is made, and how bought at first hand; that he
should know which are the proper markets, and
what the particular kinds of goods to exchange
<PB N="44" REF="61"/>
at those markets; that he should know the man∣ner
how every manufacture is managed, and the
method of their sale.</P>
<P>IT cannot be expected that he should have
judgment in the choice of all kinds of goods,
though in a great many he may have judgment
too; but there is a general understanding in
trade, which every tradesman both may and
ought to arrive to; and this perfectly qualifies
him to engage in any new undertaking, and
to embark with other persons better qualified
than himself, in any new trade which he was not
in before; in which, tho' he may not have a
particular knowledge and judgment in the goods
they are to deal in, or to make; yet having the
benefit of the knowledge his new partner is
master of, and being himself apt to take in all
additional lights, he soon becomes experienc'd,
and the knowledge of all the other parts of bu∣siness
qualifies him to be a sufficient partner; for
example, <HI>A. B.</HI> was bred a dry-salter, and he
goes in partner with <HI>C. D.</HI> a scarlet-dyer, cal∣led
a bow-dyer, at <HI>Wandsworth.</HI></P>
<P>AS a salter, <HI>A. B.</HI> has had experience enough
in the materials for dying, as well scarlets as all
other colours, and understands very well the buy∣ing
of cocheneal, indigo, gauls, shumach, log∣wood,
fustick, madder, and the like; so that he
does his part very well. <HI>C. D.</HI> is an experien∣ced
scarlet-dyer, but now doubling their stock,
they fall into a larger work, and they dye bays
and stuffs and other goods into differing colours,
as occasion requires; and this brings them to
an equality in the business, and by hiring good
<PB N="45" REF="62"/>
experienced servants, they go on very well to∣gether.</P>
<P>THE like happens often when a tradesman
turns his hand from one trade to another; and
when he embarks, either in partnership or out
of it, in any new business, 'tis suppos'd he sel∣dom
changes hands in such a manner without
some such suitable person to join with, or that
he has some experienced head work-man to di∣rect
him, which, if that work-man proves honest,
is as well as a partner. On the other hand, his
own application and indefatigable industry sup∣plies
the want of judgment: Thus I have known
several tradesmen turn their hands from one bu∣siness
to another, or from one trade entirely to
another, and very often with good success; for
example, I have seen a confectioner turn a sugar∣baker,
another a distiller; an apothecary turn
chymist, and not a few turn physicians, and prove
very good physicians too, but that is a step be∣yond
what I am speaking of.</P>
<P>BUT my argument turns upon this (<HI>viz.</HI>) that
a tradesman ought to be able to turn his hand
to any thing; that is to say, to lay down one trade,
and take up another, if occasion leads him to it,
and if he sees an evident view of profit and ad∣vantage
in it; and this is only done by his hav∣ing
a general knowledge of trade, so as to have a
capacity of judging, and by but just looking upon
what is offer'd or proposed, he sees as much at
first view as others do by long enquiry, and with
the judgment of many advisers.</P>
<P>WHEN I am thus speaking of the tradesman's
being capable of making a judgment of things,
<PB N="46" REF="63"/>
it occurs with a force not to be resisted, that I
should add, he is hereby senced against bubbles
and projects, and against those fatal people call'd
projectors, who are indeed among tradesmen as
birds of prey are among the innocent fowls, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
devourers and destroyers: A tradesman cannot
be too well arm'd, nor too much caution'd a∣gainst
those sort of people; they are constantly
surrounded with them, and are as much in jeo∣pardy
from them, as a man in a croud is of
having his pocket pick'd, nay almost as a man
is when in a croud of pick-pockets.</P>
<P>NOTHING secures the tradesman against those
men so well, as his being throughly knowing in
business, having a judgment to weigh all the
delusive schemes and the fine promises of the
wheedling projector, and to see which are like∣ly
to answer, or which not; to examine all his
specious pretences, his calculations and figures,
and see whether they are as likely to answer the
end, as he takes upon him to say they will; to
make allowances for all his fine flourishes and
outsides, and then to judge for himself: A pro∣jector,
is to a tradesman a kind of incendiary;
he is in a constant plot to blow him up, or set
fire to him; for projects are generally as fatal to
a tradesman, as fire in a magazine of gun-pow∣der.</P>
<P>THE honest tradesman is always in danger,
and cannot be too wary; and therefore to for∣tify
his judgment, that he may be able to guard
against such people as these, is one of the most
necessary things I can do for him.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="64"/>
IN order then to direct the tradesman how to
furnish himself thus with a needful stock of tra∣ding
knowledge, first, I shall propose to him
to converse with tradesmen chiefly: he that will
be a tradesman should confine himself within
his own sphere: never was the gazette so full of
the advertisements of commissions of bankrupt
as since our shop-keepers are so much engaged
in parties, form'd into clubs to hear news, and
read journals and politicks; in short, when
tradesmen turn statesmen, they should either
shut up their shops, or hire somebody else to
look after them.</P>
<P>THE known story of the upholsterer is very
instructive, who, in his abundant concern for the
publick, run himself out of his business into a
jayl; and even when he was in prison, could
not sleep for the concern he had for the liber∣ties
of his dear country: the man was a good
patriot, but a bad shop-keeper; and indeed should
rather have shut up his shop, and got a commis∣sion
in the army, and then he had served his
country in the way of his calling. But I may
speak to this more in its turn.</P>
<P>MY present subject is not the negative, what he
should not do, but the affirmative, what he should
do: <HI>I say,</HI> he should take all occasions to con∣verse
within the circuit of his own sphere, that
is, dwell upon the subect of trade in his con∣versation,
and sort with and converse among
tradesmen as much as he can; as writing teach∣es
to write, <HI>scribendo discis scribere,</HI> so conver∣ging
among tradesmen will make him a trades∣man.
I need not explain this so critically as to
<PB N="48" REF="65"/>
tell you I do not mean he should confine or re∣strain
himself entirely from ail manner of con∣versation
but among his own class: I shall speak
to that in its place also. A tradesman may on
occasion keep company with gentlemen as well
as other people; nor is a trading man, if he is a
man of sense, unsuitable or unprofitable for a
gentleman to converse with, as occasion requires;
and you will often find, that not private gentle∣men
only, but even, ministers of state, privy∣counsellors,
members of parliament, and per∣sons
of all ranks in the government, find it for
their purpose to converse with tradesmen, and
are not asham'd to acknowledge, that a trades∣man
is sometimes qualified to inform them in
the most difficult and intricate, as well as the
most urgent affairs of government; and this has
been the reason, why so marry tradesmen have
been advanc'd to honours and dignities above
their ordinary rank, as Sir <HI>Charles Duncombe,</HI>
a goldsmith; Sir <HI>Henry Furnese,</HI> who was ori∣ginally
a retail <HI>hosier;</HI> Sir <HI>Charles Cook,</HI> late one
of the board of trade, a <HI>merchant;</HI> Sir <HI>Josiah
Child,</HI> originally a very mean tradesman; the
late Mr. <HI>Lowndes,</HI> bred a <HI>scrivener;</HI> and many
others too many to name.</P>
<P>BUT these are instances of men call'd out of
their lower sphere for their eminent usefulness,
and their known capacities, being first known
to be diligent and industrious men in their
private and lower spheres; such advancements
make good the words of the wise man, <HI>Seest
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a man diligent in business, he shall stand
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, he shall not stand before mean men.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="66"/>
IN the mean time the tradesman's proper bu∣siness
is in his shop or warehouse, and among
his own class or rank of people; there he sees
how other men go on, and there he learns how
to go on himself; there he sees how other men
thrive, and learns to thrive himself; there he
hears all the trading news, as for state news and
politicks, 'tis none of his business; there he
learns how to buy, and there he gets oftentimes
opportunities to sell; there he hears of all the
disasters in trade, who breaks, and why; what
brought such, and such a man to misfortunes and
disasters; and sees the various ways how men
go down in the world, as well as the arts and
management, by which others from nothing rise
to wealth and estates.</P>
<P>HERE he sees the scripture itself thwarted,
and his neighbour tradesman, a wholesale ha∣berdasher,
in spight of a good understanding,
in spight of a good beginning, and in spight
of the most indefatigable industry, sink in his
circumstances, lose his credit, then his stock, and
then break and become bankrupt, while the
man takes more pains to be poor, than others
do to grow rich.</P>
<P>THERE on the other hand he sees <HI>G. D.</HI>
a plodding weak-headed, but laborious wretch,
of a confin'd genius, and that can't look a quar∣ter
of a mile from his shop-door into the world,
and beginning with little or nothing, yet rises
apace in the meer road of business, in which he
goes on like the miller's horse, who being tied
to the post is turn'd round by the very wheel,
which he turns round himself; and this fellow
<PB N="52" REF="67"/>
shall get money insensibly, and grow rich even
he knows not how, and no body else knows
why.</P>
<P>HERE he sees <HI>F. M.</HI> ruin'd by too much
trade, and there he sees <HI>M. F.</HI> starv'd for want
of trade, and from all these observations he may
learn something useful to himself, and fit to
guide his own measures, that he may not fall
into the same mischiefs which he sees others sink
under, and that he may take the advantage of
that prudence which others rise by.</P>
<P>ALL these things will naturally occur to him
in his conversing among his fellow-tradesmen;
a settled little society of trading people, who
understand business, and are carrying on trade
in the same manner with himself, no matter
whether they are of the very same trades, or no,
and perhaps better not of the same, such a so∣ciety,
I say, shall, if due observations are made
from it, teach the tradesman more, than his ap∣prenticeship;
for there he learnt the operation,
here he learns the progression; his apprentice∣ship
is his grammar-school, this is his univer∣sity;
behind his master's counter, or in his ware∣house,
he learnt the first rudiments of trade, but
here he learns the trading sciences; here he comes
to learn the <HI>arcana,</HI> speak the language, understand
the meaning of every thing, of which before he
only learnt the beginning: the apprenticeship
inducts him, and leads him as the nurse the child;
this finishes him; there he learnt the beginning
of trade, here he sees it in its full extent; in a
word, there he learnt to trade, here he is made a
<HI>complete tradesman.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="68"/>
LET no young tradesman object, that in the
conversation I speak of, there is so many gross
things said, and so many ridiculous things ar∣gued
upon, there being always a great many weak
empty heads among the shop-keeping trading
world: this may be granted without any im∣peachment
of what I have advanced; for where
shall a man converse, and find no fools in the
society? and where shall he hear the weightiest
things debated, and not a great many empty weak
things offer'd, out of which nothing can be learn∣ed,
and from which nothing can be deduced,
for <HI>ex nihil nihilo fit?</HI></P>
<P>BUT notwithstanding let me still insist upon
it to the tradesman to keep company with trades∣men;
let the fool run on in his own way; let
the talkative green-apron rattle in his own way;
let the manufacturer and his factor squabble and
brangle; the grave self-conceited puppy, who
was born a boy, and will die before he is a man,
chatter and say a great deal of nothing, and talk
his neighbours to death; out of every one you
will learn something; they are all tradesmen,
and there is always something for a young trades∣man
to learn from them.</P>
<P>IF understanding but a little <HI>French,</HI> you were
to converse every day a little among some
<HI>Frenchmen</HI> in your neighbourhood, and suppose
those <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> you thus kept company with,
were every one of them fools, meer, ignorant,
empty, foolish fellows; there might be nothing
learnt from their sense, but you'd still learn <HI>French</HI>
from 'em, if it was no more than the tone and
accent, and the ordinary words usual in conver∣sation.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="69"/>
THUS among your silly empty tradesmen, let
them be as foolish and empty other ways as you
can suggest, tho' you can learn no philosophy
from them, you may learn many things in trade
from them, and something from every one;
for tho' it is not absolutely necessary that every
tradesman should be a philosopher, yet every
tradesman in his way knows something that e∣ven
a philosopher may learn from.</P>
<P>I knew a philosopher that was excellently
skill'd in the noble science or study of astrono∣my,
who told me he had some years studied for
some simily, or proper allusion, to explain to
his scholars the phenomena of the sun's motion
round its own axis, and could never happen up∣on
one to his mind, 'till by accident he saw his
maid <HI>Betty</HI> trundling her mop: surpris'd with
the exactness of the motion to describe the thing
he wanted, he goes into his study, calls his pu∣pils
about him, and tells them that <HI>Betty,</HI> who
herself knew nothing of the matter, could shew
them the sun revolving about itself in a more
lively manner than ever he could. According∣ly
<HI>Betty</HI> was call'd, and bad bring out her mop,
when placing his scholars in a due position, op∣posite
not to the face of the maid, but to her
left side, so that they could see the end of the
mop, when it wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rl'd round upon her arm; they
took it immediately; there was the broad headed
nail in the center, which was as the body of the
sun, and the thrums whisking round, flinging
the water about every way by innumerable little
streams, describing exactly the rays of the sun
darting light from the center no the whole system.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="70"/>
IF ignorant <HI>Betty,</HI> by the natural consequence
of her operation instructed the astronomer, why
may not the meanest shoemaker or pedlar, by
the ordinary sagacity of his trading wit, tho' it
may be indeed very ordinary, coarse and un∣look'd
for, communicate something, give some
useful hint, dart some sudden thought into the
mind of the observing tradesman, which he
shall make his use of, and apply to his own ad∣vantage
in trade, when at the same time he that
gives such hint shall himself, like <HI>Betty</HI> and her
mop, know nothing of the matter?</P>
<P>EVERY tradesman is supposed to manage his
business his own way; and generally speaking
most tradesmen have some ways peculiar and
particular to themselves; which they either de∣rived
from the masters who taught them, or
from the experience of things, or from some∣thing
in the course of their business, which had
not happen'd to them before.</P>
<P>AND those little <HI>nostrums</HI> are oftentime very
properly, and with advantage communicated
from one to another; one tradesman finds out
a nearer way of buying than another, another
finds a vent for what is bought beyond what
his neighbour knows of, and these in time
come to be learned of them by their ordinary
conversation.</P>
<P>I am not for confining the tradesman from
keeping better company, as occasion and leisure
requires; I allow the tradesman to act the gen∣tleman
sometimes, and that even for conversa∣tion,
at least if his understanding and capaci∣ty
make him suitable company to them; but
<PB N="56" REF="71"/>
still his business is among those of his own
rank. The conversation of gentlemen, and
what they call keeping good company, may be
used as a diversion, or as an excursion, but his
stated society must be with his neighbours, and
people in trade; men of business are compa∣nions
for men of business; with gentlemen he
may converse pleasantly, but here he converses
profitably; tradesmen are always profitable to
one another; as they always gain by trading
together, so they never lose by conversing to∣gether;
if they do not get money, they gain
knowledge in business, improve their experi∣ence,
and see farther and farther into the world.</P>
<P>A man of but an ordinary penetration will
improve himself by conversing in matters of
trade with men of trade; by the experience of
the old tradesmen they learn caution and pru∣dence,
and by the rashness and the miscarriages
of the young, they learn what are the mischiefs
that themselves may be exposed to.</P>
<P>AGAIN, in conversing with men of trade,
they get trade; men first talk together, then
deal together; many a good bargain is made,
and many a pound gained, where nothing was
expected, by mere casual coming to talk toge∣ther,
without knowing any thing of the matter
before they met: The tradesmens meetings are
like the merchants exchange, where they ma∣nage,
negotiate, and indeed beget business with
one another.</P>
<P>LET no tradesman mistake me in this part,
I am not encouraging them to leave their shops
and warehouses, to go to taverns and ale-houses,
<PB N="53" REF="72"/>
and spend their time there in unneccssary prat∣tle,
which indeed is nothing but sotting and
drinking; this is not meeting to do business;
but to neglect business. Of which I shall speak
fully to you in a letter by it self.</P>
<P>BUT the tradesmen conversing with one an∣other
which I mean, is the taking suitable oc∣casions
to discourse with their fellow tradesmen,
meeting them in the way of their business, and
improving their spare hours together; to leave
their shops, and quit their counters in the pro∣per
seasons for their attendance there, would
be a preposterous negligence, would be going
out of business to gain business, and would be
cheating themselves instead of improving them∣selves;
the proper hours of business are sacred
to the shop and the warehouse; he that goes
out of the order of trade, let the pretence of
business be what it will, loses his business, not
encreases it; and will, if continued, lose the
credit of his conduct in business also.</P>

expos'd, 'tis perfectly haunted with thieves
and shop-lifters; they see no body but raw
<PB N="57" REF="74"/>
boys in it, that mind nothing, and the diligent
devils never fail to haunt them; so that there's
more out-cries of <HI>stop thief</HI> at their door,
and more constables fetch'd to that shop, than
to all the shops in the row. There was a
brave trade at that shop in Mr.—'s time;
he was a true shopkeeper; like the quack doctor,
you never mist him from seven in the morn∣ing
to twelve, and from two till nine at
night; and he throve accordingly, he left a
good estate behind him; but I don't know
what these people are, they say there are two
partners of them, but there had as good be
none, for they are never at home, nor in
their shop; one wears a long wig and a sword,
I hear, and you see him often in the <HI>Mall</HI>
and at court, but very seldom in his shop, or
waiting on his customers; and the other,
they say, lies a bed till eleven a clock every
day, just comes into the shop and shews him∣self,
then stalks about to the tavern to take a
whet, then to <HI>Child</HI>'s coffee-house to hear
the news, comes home to dinner at onc,
takes a long sleep in his chair after it, and
about four a clock comes into the shop for
half an hour, or thereabouts, then to the ta∣vern,
where he stays till two in the morning,
gets drunk, and is led home by the watch,
and so lies till eleven again; and thus he
walks round like the hand of a dial; and
what will it all come to? they'll certainly
break, that you may be sure of, they can't
hold it long.”</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="75"/>
THIS is the town's way of talking, where
they see an example of it in the manner as is
describ'd; nor are the inferences unjust, any
more than the description is unlike, for such
certainly is the end of such management, and
no shop thus neglected ever made a tradesman
rich.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, customers love to see the
master's face in the shop, and to go to a shop
where they are sure to find him at home
when he don't sell, or cannot take the price
offer'd, yet the customers are not disoblig'd,
and if they do not deal now, they may another
time; if they do deal, the master generally gets
a better price for his goods than a servant can,
besides that he gives better content; and yet
the customers always think they buy cheaper of
the master too.</P>
<P>I seem to be talking now of the mercer or
draper, as if my discourse was wholly bent and
directed to them; but it is quite contrary, for
it concerns every tradesman, the advice is ge∣neral,
and every tradesman claims a share in it;
the nature of trade requires it. 'Tis an old an∣glicism,
<HI>such a man drives a trade;</HI> the allusion
is to a carter, that with his voice, his hands,
his whip, and his constant attendance, keeps the
team always going, helps himself, lifts at the
wheel in every slough, doubles his application
upon every difficulty, and in a word, to com∣pleat
the simily, if he is not always with his
horses, either the waggon is set in a hole, or
the team stands still, or, which is worst of all,
the loading is spoil'd by the waggon overthrow∣ing</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="76"/>
'Tis therefore no improper speech to say,
such a man <HI>drives</HI> his trade; for in short, if
trade is not driven, it will not go.</P>
<P>TRADE is like a hand-mill, it must always be
turned about by the diligent hand of the mas∣ter;
or if you will, like the pump-house at <HI>Am∣sterdam,</HI>
where they put offenders in for petty
matters, especially beggars; if they will work and
keep pumping, they sit well, and dry and safe,
and if they work very hard one hour or two,
they may rest, perhaps, a quarter of an hour af∣terwards;
but if they oversleep themselves, or
grow lazy, the water comes in upon them and
wets them, and they have no dry place to stand
in, much less to sit down in; and in short, if
they continue obstinately idle, they must sink;
so that it is nothing but <HI>pump</HI> or <HI>drown,</HI> and
they may chuse which they like best.</P>
<P>HE that engages in trade, and does not re∣solve
to work at it, is <HI>felo de se;</HI> 'tis downright
murthering himself; that is to say, in his trading
capacity, he murthers his credit, he murthers
his stock, and he starves, <HI>which is as bad as
murthering</HI> his family.</P>
<P>TRADE must not be entred into as a thing of
light concern; it is called <HI>business</HI> very properly,
for it is a business <HI>for</HI> life, and ought to be fol∣low'd
as one of the great businesses <HI>of</HI> life; I do
not say the chief, but one of the great businesses
of life it certainly is: trade must, I say, be
work'd at, not play'd with; he that trades in
jest, will certainly break in earnest; and this is
one reason indeed why so many tradesmen
come to so hasty a conclusion of their affairs.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="77"/>
THERE was another old <HI>English</HI> saying to
this purpose, which shews how much our old
fathers were sensible of the duty of a shop∣keeper:
speaking of the tradesman as just open∣ing
his shop, and beginning a dialogue with it;
the result of which is, that the shop replies to
the tradesman thus, <HI>Keep me, and I will keep
thee.</HI> 'Tis the same with driving the trade; if
the shopkeeper will not keep, that is, diligently
attend his shop, the shop will not keep, that is,
maintain him: and in the other sense 'tis harsher
to him, if he will not drive his trade, the trade
will drive him; that is, drive him out of the
shop, drive him away.</P>
<P>ALL these old sayings have this monitory
substance in them; namely, they all concur to
fill a young tradesman with true notions of
what he is going about; and that the under∣taking
of a trade is not a sport or game, in
which he is to meet with diversions only, and
entertainment, and not to be in the least troubled
or disturb'd: trade is a daily employment, and
must be follow'd as such, with the full atten∣tion
of the mind, and full attendance of the
person; nothing but what are to be called the
necessary duties of life, are to intervene; and
even those are to be limited so, as not to be
prejudicial to business.</P>
<P>AND now I am speaking of the necessary
things which may intervene, and which may
divide the time with our business or trade, I
shall state the manner in a few words, that the
tradesman may neither give too much, or take
away too much, to or from any respective part
<PB N="61" REF="78"/>
of what may be call'd his proper employment,
but keep as due a balance of his time, as he should
of his books, or cash.</P>
<P>THE life of man is or should be a measure
of allotted time; as his time is measured out to
him, so the measure is limited, must end, and
the end of it is appointed.</P>
<P>THE purposes, for which time is given, and
life bestow'd, are very momentous; no time is
given useless, and for nothing; time is no more
to be unemploy'd, than it is to be ill employ'd.
Three things are chiefly before us in the appoint∣ment
of our time; 1. Necessaries of nature. 2.
Duties of religion, or things relating to a future
life. 3. Duties of the present life, <HI>viz.</HI> business
and calling.</P>
<P>I. NECESSITIES of nature, such as eating and
drinking; rest, or sleep; and in case of disease,
a recess from business; all which have two limita∣tions
on them, and no more; namely, that they be
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. Referr'd to their proper seasons:</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Us'd with moderation.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q></P>
<P>BOTH these might give me subject to write
many letters upon, but I study brevity, and de∣sire
rather to hint than dwell upon things which
are serious and grave, because I would not tire
you.</P>
<P>II. DUTIES of religion: these may be call'd
necessities too in their kind, and that of the sub∣limest
nature; and they ought not to be thrust
at all out of their place, and yet they ought to
be kept in their place too,</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="79"/>
III. DUTIES of life, that is to say, business,
or employment, or calling, which are divided
into three kinds;
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. Labour, or servitude.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Employment.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Trade.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q></P>
<P>BY labour, I mean the poor manualist, whom
we properly call the labouring man, who works
for himself indeed in one respect, but some∣times
serves and works for wages, as a servant,
or workman.</P>
<P>BY employment I mean men in business,
which yet is not properly call'd trade, such as
lawyers, physicians, surgeons, seriveners, clerks,
secretaries, and such like: and</P>
<P>BY trade I mean merchants and inland-traders,
such as are already describ'd in the introduction
to this work.</P>
<P>TO speak of time, it is divided among these;
even in them all there is a just equality of
circumstances to be preserv'd, and as diligence is
requir'd in one, and necessity to be obeyed in
another, so duty is to be observed in the third;
and yet all these with such a due regard to one
another, as that one duty may not jostle out
another; and every thing going on with an e∣quality
and just regard to the nature of the thing,
the tradesman may go on with a glad heart, and
a quiet conscience.</P>
<P>THIS article is very nice, as I intend to speak
to it; and 'tis a dangerous thing indeed to speak
to, lest young tradesmen, treading on the
<PB N="61" REF="80"/>
brink of duty on one side, and duty on the
other side, should pretend to neglect their duty
to heaven, on pretence that I say they must
not neglect their shops: But let them do me
justice, and they will do themselves no injury;
nor do I fear that my arguing on this point
should give them any just cause to go wrong; if
they will go wrong, and plead my argument for
their excuse, it must be by their abusing my di∣rections,
and taking them in pieces, misplacing
the words, and disjointing the sense, and by
the same method they may make blasphemy of
the scripture.</P>
<P>THE duties of life, I say, must not interfere
with one another, must not jostle one another
out of the place, or so break in as to be preju∣dicial
to one another. It is certainly the duty
of every christian to worship God, to pay his
homage morning and evening to his Maker, and
at all other proper seasons to behave as becomes
a sincere worshiper of God; nor must any avo∣cation,
either of business or nature, however
necessary, interfere with this duty, either in pub∣lick
or in private. This is plainly asserting the
necessity of the duty, so no man can pretend to
evade that.</P>
<P>BUT the duties of nature and religion also
have such particular seasons, and those seasons
so proper to themselves, and so stated, as not
to break in or intrench upon one another, that
we are really without excuse, if we let any one
be pleaded for the neglect of the other. Food,
sleep, rest, and the necessities of nature, are ei∣ther
reserved for the night, which is appointed
<PB N="64" REF="81"/>
for man to rest, or take up so little room in the
day, that they can never be pleaded in bar of
either religion, or employment.</P>
<P>HE indeed, who will sleep when he should
work, and perhaps drink when he should sleep,
turns nature bottom upwards, inverts the ap∣pointment
of providence, and must account to
himself, and afterwards to a higher judge for
the neglect.</P>
<P>THE devil, if it be the devil that tempts, for
I would not wrong Satan himself, plays our du∣ties
often one against another; and to bring us,
if possible, into confusion in our conduct, subtly
throws religion out of its place, to put it in
our way, and to urge us to a breach of what
we ought to do: besides this subtle tempter, for
as above I wont charge it all upon the devil,
we have a great hand in it ourselves; but let it be
who it will, I say, this subtle tempter hurries the
well-meaning tradesman, to act in all manner of
irregularity, that he may confound religion and
business, and in the end may destroy both.</P>
<P>WHEN the tradesman well-inclin'd rises early
in the morning, and is mov'd, as in duty to
his Maker he ought, to pay his morning vows
to him either in his closet, or at the church,
where he hears the six o'clock bell ring to call
his neighbours to the same duty; then the se∣cret
hint comes cross his happy intention, that
he must go to such or such a place, that he may
be back time enough for such other business as
has been appointed over night, and both per∣haps
may be both lawful and nccessary; so his
diligence oppresses his religion, and away he
<PB N="65" REF="82"/>
runs to do his business, and neglects his morn∣ing
sacrifice to his Maker.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, and at another time, be∣ing
in his shop or his compting-house, or ware∣house,
a vast throng of business upon his hands,
and the world in his head, when it is highly
his duty to attend it, and shall be to his preju∣dice
to absent himself; then the same deceiver
presses him earnestly to go to his closet, or to
the church to prayers, during which time his
customer goes to another place, the neighbours
miss him in his shop, his business is lost, his re∣putation
suffers, and by this <HI>turn'd into a pra∣ctice,</HI>
the man may say his prayers so long and
so unseasonably 'till he is undone, and not a
creditor he has (I may give it him from experi∣ence)
will use him the better, or shew him the
more favour, when a commission of bankrupt
comes out against him.</P>
<P>THUS I knew once a zealous, pious, religious
tradesman, who would almost shut up his shop e∣very
day about nine or ten o'clock to call all his
family together to prayers; and yet he was no
presbyterian I assure you; I say, he would almost
shut up his shop, for he would suffer none of his
servants to be absent from his family-worship.</P>
<P>THIS man had certainly been right, had he
made all his family get up by six o'clock in the
morning, and call'd them to prayers before he
had open'd his shop; but instead of that, he
first suffer'd sleep to interfere with religion, and
lying a bed to postpone and jostle out his pray∣ers,
and then to make God almighty amends
upon himself, wounds his family by making his
<PB N="66" REF="83"/>
prayers interfere with his trade, and shut his
customers out of his shop; the end of which
was, the poor good man deceiv'd himself, and
lost his business.</P>
<P>ANOTHER tradesman, whom I knew perso∣nally
well, was rais'd in the morning very early,
by the outcries of his wife, to go and fetch
a midwife; It was necessary in his way to go by
a church, where there was always on that day
of the week a morning-sermon early, for the
supplying the devotion of such early christains
as he; so the honest man seeing the door o∣pen,
steps in, and seeing the minister just gone up
into the pulpit, sits down, joins in the prayers,
hears the sermon, and goes very gravely home
again; in short, his earnestness in the worship,
and attention to what he had heard, quite put
the errand he was sent about out of his head;
and the poor woman in travail, after having wait∣ed
long for the return of her husband with the
midwife, was obliged, (having run an extreme
hazard by depending on his expedition,) to dis∣patch
other messengers, who fetch'd the midwife,
and she was come and the work over, long be∣fore
the sermon was done, or that any body
heard of the husband: at last he was met coming
gravely home from the church, when being up∣braided
with his negligence, in a dreadful sur∣prise
he struck his hands together, and cried out,
<HI>How is my wife! I profess I forgot it.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT shall we say now to this ill-tim'd devo∣tion,
and who must tempt the poor man to this
neglect? certainly had he gone for the midwife,
it had been much more his duty, than to go to
hear a sermon at that time.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="84"/>
I knew also another tradesman, who was such
a sermon-hunter, and, as there are lectures and
sermons preach'd in <HI>London,</HI> either in the church∣es,
or meeting-houses, almost every day in the
week, us'd so affiduously to hunt out these oc∣casions,
that whether it was in a church or
meeting-house, or both, he was always abroad
to hear a sermon, at least once every day, and
sometimes more; and the consequence was, that
the man lost his trade, his shop was entire∣ly
neglected, the time which was proper for
him to apply to his business was misapply'd, his
trade fell off, and the man broke.</P>
<P>NOW it is true, and I ought to take notice
of it also, that tho' these things happen, and may
wrong a tradesman, yet 'tis oftner ten times for
once, that tradesmen neglect their shop and bu∣siness
to follow the track of their vices and ex∣travagance;
some by taverns, others to the
gaming-houses; others to balls and masquerades,
plays, harlequins, and opera's; very few by too
much religion.</P>
<P>BUT my inference is still sound, and the more
effectually so as to that part; for if our business
and trades are not to be neglected, no not for
the extraordinary excursions of religion and re∣ligious
duties, much less are they to be neglected
for vices and extravagances.</P>
<P>THIS is an age of gallantry and gaiety, and
never was the city transpos'd to the court as it
is now: the play-houses and balls are now fil∣led
with citizens and young tradesmen, instead
of gentlemen and families of distinction; the
shop-keepers were a differing garb now and are
<PB N="68" REF="85"/>
seen with their long wigs and swords, rather
than with aprons on, as was formely the figure
they made.</P>
<P>BUT what is the difference in the consequen∣ces?
you did not see in those days acts of grace
for the relief of insolvent debtors almost every
sessions of parliament, and yet the jails fill'd with
insolvents before the next year, though ten or
twelve thousand have been releas'd at a time by
those acts.</P>
<P>NOR did you hear of so many commissions
of bankrupt every week in the gazette, as is now
the case; in a word, whether you take the low∣er
sort of tradesmen, or the higher, where there
was twenty that fail'd in those days, I believe I
speak within compass, if I say that five hundred
turn insolvent now; it is, as I said above, an
age of pleasure, and as the wise man said long
ago, <HI>he that loves pleasure shall be a poor man.</HI>
So it is now: 'tis an age of drunkenness and ex∣travagance,
and thousands ruin themselves by
that; 'tis an age of luxurious and expensive liv∣ing,
and thousands more undo themselves by
that; but among all our vices nothing ruins a
tradesman so effectually, as the neglect of his
business: it is true, all those things prompt men
to neglect their business, but the more season∣able
is the advice; either enter upon no trade,
undertake no business, or having undertaken it,
persue it diligently; DRIVE your trade, that the
world may not drive you out of trade, and ru∣in
and undo you.</P>
<P>WITHOUT diligence a man can never through∣ly
understand his business; and how should a
<PB N="69" REF="86"/>
man thrive, when he does not perfectly know
what he is doing, or how to do it? application
to his trade teaches him how to carry it on, as
much as his going apprentice taught him how
to set it up. Certainly that man shall never im∣prove
in his trading knowledge, that does not
know his business, or how to carry it on: the
diligent tradesman is always the knowing and
complete tradesman.</P>
<P>NOW in order to have a man apply heartily,
and persue earnestly the business he is engag'd in,
there is yet another thing necessary, namely, that
he should delight in it: to follow a trade, and
not to love and delight in it, is a slavery, a bon∣dage,
not a business: the shop is a <HI>Bridewell,</HI>
and the warehouse a house of correction to the
tradesman, if he does not delight in his trade;
while he is bound, as we say, to keep his shop,
he is like the galley-slave chain'd down to the
oar; he tuggs and labours indeed, and exerts
the utmost of his strength for fear of the strap∣pado,
and because he is obliged to do it; but when
he is on shore, and is out from the bank, he ab∣hors
the labour, and hates to come to it again.</P>
<P>TO delight in business is making business
pleasant and agreeable; and such a tradesman
cannot but be diligent in it, which according to
<HI>Solomon</HI> makes him certainly rich, and in time
raises him above the world, and able to instruct
and encourage those who come after him.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Over-trading.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is an observation indeed of my own,
but I believe it will hold true almost in
all the chief trading towns in <HI>England,</HI>
That there are more tradesmen undone by hav∣ing
too much trade, than for want of trade.
Over-trading is among tradesmen as over-lifting
is among strong men; such people vain of
their strength, and their pride prompting them
to put it to the utmost trial, at last lift at
something too heavy for them, over-strain their
sinews, break some of nature's bands, and are
cripples ever after.</P>
<P>I take over-trading to be to a shop-keeper, as
ambition is to a prince. The late king of <HI>France,</HI>
the great king <HI>Lewis,</HI> ambition led him to in∣vade
the dominions of his neighbours; and
while upon the Empire here, or the States Ge∣neral
there, or the <HI>Spanish Netherlands</HI> on an∣other
quarter, he was an over-match for every
one, and in their single capacity he gain'd from
them all: but at last pride made him think him∣self
a match for them all together, and he enter'd
into a declar'd war against the Emperor and the
Empire, the kings of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="88"/>
and the States of <HI>Holland</HI> all at once: and what
was the consequence? they reduc'd him to the
utmost distress, he lost all his conquests, was
oblig'd by a dishonourable peace to quit what
he had got by encroachment, to demolish his
invincible towns, such as <HI>Pignerol, Dunkirk, &amp;c.</HI>
the two strongest fortresses in <HI>Europe;</HI> and in a
word, like a bankrupt monarch, he may in ma∣ny
cases be said to have died a beggar.</P>
<P>THUS the strong man in the fable, who by
main strength us'd to rive a tree, undertook one
at last which was too strong for him, and it clos'd
upon his fingers and held him till the wild
beasts came and devour'd him. Tho' the story
is a fable, the moral is good to my present pur∣pose,
and is not at all above my subject; I
mean, that of a tradesman, who should be
warn'd against over-trading, as earnestly, and
with as much passion, as I would warn a dealer
in gunpowder to be wary of fire, or a distiller
or rectifier of spirits to moderate his furnace, lest
the heads of his stills fly off, and he should be
scalded to death.</P>
<P>FOR a young tradesman to over-trade him∣self,
is like a young swimmer going out of his
depth; when if help does not come immediate∣ly,
'tis a thousand to one but he sinks, and is
drown'd.</P>
<P>ALL rash adventures are condemn'd by the
prudent part of mankind; but 'tis as hard to re∣strain
youth in trade, as 'tis in any other thing,
where the advantage stands in view, and the
danger out of sight: the profits of trade are
baits to the avaritious shop-keeper, and he is
<PB N="72" REF="89"/>
forward to reckon them up to himself; but
does not perhaps cast up the difficulty which there
may be to compass it, or the unhappy conse∣quences
of a miscarriage.</P>
<P>FOR want of this consideration, the trades∣man
oftentimes drowns, as I may call it, even
within his depth; that is, he sinks when he has
really the substance at bottom to keep him up;
and this is all owing to an adventurous bold
spirit in trade, join'd with too great a gust of
gain. Avarice is the ruin of many people be∣sides
tradesmen; and I might give the late South-sea
calamity for an example, in which the longest
heads were most over-reach'd, not so much by the
wit or cunning of those they had to deal with,
as by the secret promptings of their own avarice;
wherein they abundantly verified an old prover∣bial
speech or saying, (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>All covet all lose;</HI>
so it was there indeed, and the cunningest, wisest,
sharpest men lost the most money.</P>
<P>THERE are two things which may be proper∣ly
call'd <HI>over-trading,</HI> in a young beginner;
and by both which tradesmen are often over∣thrown.</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. TRADING beyond their stock.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. GIVING too large credit.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>A tradesman ought to consider and measure
well the extent of his own strength; his stock
of money and credit is properly his beginning;
for credit is a stock as well as money: he that
takes too much credit is really in as much dan∣ger,
as he that gives too much credit; and the
danger lies particularly in this, if the tradesman
over-buys himself, that is, buys faster than he
<PB N="73" REF="90"/>
can sell, buying upon credit, the payments per∣haps
come due too soon for him; the goods
not being sold, he must answer the bills upon
the strength of his proper stock; that is, pay
for them out of his own cash: if that should
not hold out, he is oblig'd to put off his bills
after they are due, or suffer the impertinence
of being dunn'd by the creditor, <HI>and perhaps by
servants and apprentices,</HI> and that with the usual
indecencies of such kind of people.</P>
<P>THIS impairs his credit, and if he comes to
deal with the same merchant, or clothier, or o∣ther
tradesman again, he is treated like one that
is but an indifferent paymaster; and tho' they may
give him credit as before, yet depending that if
he bargains for six months, he will take eight
or nine in the payment, they consider it in the
price, and use him accordingly; and this im∣pairs
his gain: so that loss of credit is indeed
loss of money, and this weakens him both ways.</P>
<P>A tradesman therefore, especially at his be∣ginning,
ought to be very wary of taking too
much credit; he had much better slip the occa∣sion
of buying now and then a bargain to his
advantage, (for that is usually the temptation,)
than buying a greater quantity of goods than he
can pay for, run into debt, and be insulted, and
at last ruin'd. Merchants and wholesale deal∣ers,
<HI>to put off their goods,</HI> are very apt to
prompt young shopkeepers and young tradesmen
to buy great quantities of goods, and take large
credit at first: but 'tis a snare that many a young
beginner has fallen into, and been ruin'd in the
very bud; for if the young beginner does not
<PB N="74" REF="91"/>
find a vent for the quantity, he is undone,
for at the time of payment the merchant ex∣pects
his money, whether the goods are sold or
not; and if he cannot pay he is gone at once.</P>
<P>THE tradesman that buys warily, always pays
surely, and every young beginner ought to buy
cautiously: if he has money to pay, he need
never fear goods to be had; the merchants
warehouses are always open, and they may sup∣ply
themselves upon all occasions, as they want,
and as their customers call.</P>
<P>IT may pass for a kind of an objection here,
that there are some goods which a tradesman
may deal in, which are to be bought at such
and such markets only, and at such and such
fairs only, that is to say, are chiefly bought
there; as the cheesemongers buy their stocks of
cheese and of butter, the cheese at several fairs
in <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> as at <HI>Atherston</HI> fair in parti∣cular,
or at—fair in <HI>Gloucestershire,</HI>
and at <HI>Sturbridge</HI> fair near <HI>Cambridge;</HI> and their
butter at <HI>Ipswich</HI> fair in <HI>Suffolk;</HI> and so of
many other things; but the answer is plain,
those things which are generally bought thus,
are ready money goods, and the tradesman has a
sure rule for buying, namely, his cash: but as
I am speaking of taking credit, so I must be
necessarily suppos'd to speak of such goods as are
bought upon credit, as the linen-draper buys of
the <HI>Hambro'</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> merchants; the woollen∣draper
of the <HI>Blackwell-hall</HI> men; the haber∣das<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er
of the thread merchants; the mercer
of the weavers and <HI>Italian</HI> merchants; the silk∣man
of the <HI>Turkey</HI> merchants; and the like:
<PB N="75" REF="92"/>
here they are under no necessity of running
deep into debt, but may buy sparingly, and re∣cruit
again as they sell off.</P>
<P>I know some tradesmen are very fond of
seeing their shops well stockt, and their ware∣houses
full of goods, and this is a snare to
them, and brings them to buy in more goods
than they want; but this is a great error, either
in their judgment or their vanity; for except in
retailers shops, and that in some trades where
they must have a great choice of goods or else
may want a trade; otherwise a well-experienc'd
tradesman had rather see his warehouse too
empty than too full: if it be too empty, he
can fill it when he pleases, if his credit be
good, or his cash strong; but a throng'd ware∣house
is a sign of the want of customers, and of
a bad market; whereas an empty warehouse is a
sign of a nimble demand.</P>
<P>LET no young tradesman value himself upon
having a very great throng of goods in hand;
having just a necessary supply to produce a
choice of new and fashionable goods, nay, tho'
he be a mercer, for they are the most under the
necessity of a large stock of goods; but I say,
supposing even the mercer, to have a tolerable
shew and choice of fashionable goods, that gives
his shop a reputation, he derives no credit at all
from a throng of old <HI>shop-keepers,</HI> as they call them,
<HI>(viz.)</HI> out-of-fashion things: but in other trades
'tis much more a needful caution; a few goods,
and a quick sale, is the beauty of a tradesman's
warehouse, <HI>or shop either;</HI> and 'tis his wisdom
to keep himself in that posture that his pay∣ments
<PB N="76" REF="93"/>
may come in on his front, as fast as they
go out in his rear; that he may be able to an∣swer
the demands of his merchants or dealers,
and, if possible, let no man come twice for his
money.</P>
<P>THE reason of this is plain, and leads me
back to where I began; credit is stock, and if
well supported is as good as a stock, and will
be as durable. A tradesman whose credit is
good, untoucht, unspotted, and who, as above,
has maintain'd it with care, shall in many cases
buy his goods as cheap at three or four months
time of payment, as another man shall with
ready money; I say in some cases, and in goods
which are ordinarily sold for time, as all our
manufactures, <HI>the Bay trade excepted,</HI> generally
are.</P>
<P>HE then that keeps his credit unshaken, has
a double stock; I mean, 'tis an addition to his
real stock, and often superior to it: nay, I have
known several considerable tradesmen in this
city who have traded with great success, and
to a very considerable degree, and yet have not
had at bottom one shilling real stock; but by
the strength of their reputation, being sober
and diligent, and having with care preserv'd the
character of honest men, and the credit of their
business, by cautious dealing, and punctual pay∣ments,
they have gone on till the gain of their
trade has effectually establish'd them, and they
have rais'd estates out of nothing.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the dark side, <HI>viz. over-trading;</HI>
the second danger is the giving too
much credit. He that takes credit may give
<PB N="77" REF="94"/>
credit, but he must be exceeding watchful; for
'tis the most dangerous state of life that a trades∣man
can live in, for he is in as much jeopardy
as a seaman upon a lee-shore.</P>
<P>IF the people he trusts fail, or fail but of a
punctual compliance with him, he can never
support his own credit, unless by the caution I
am now giving; that is, to be very sure not to
give so much credit as he takes.</P>
<P>BY the word <HI>so much,</HI> I must be understood
thus, either he must fell for shorter time than
he takes, or in less quantity; the last is the
safest, namely, that he should be sure not to
trust out so much as he is trusted with. If he
has a real stock indeed, besides the credit he
takes, that indeed makes the case differ; and
a man that can pay his own debts, whether
other people pay him or no, that man is out of
the question; he is past danger, and cannot be
hurt: But if he trusts beyond the extent of his
stock and credit, even HE may be overthrown
too.</P>
<P>THERE were many sad examples of this in the
time of the late war, and in the days when the
publick credit was in a more precarious condition
than it has been since; I say, sad examples, <HI>viz.</HI>
when tradesmen in flourshing circumstances, and
who had indeed good estates at bottom, and were
in full credit themselves, trusted the publick
with too great sums; which not coming in at
the time expected, either by the deficiency of
the funds given by parliament, and the parlia∣ment
themselves not soon making good those
deficiencies, or by other disasters of those times;
<PB N="78" REF="95"/>
I say, their money not coming in to answer
their demands, they were ruin'd; at least, their
credit wounded, and some quite undone, who
yet, had they been paid, could have paid all
their own debts, and had good sums of money
left.</P>
<P>OTHERS, who had ability to afford it, were
oblig'd to sell their tallies and orders at 40 or 50
<HI>per cent.</HI> loss; from whence proceeded that
black trade of buying and selling navy and
victualling bills, and transport debts, by which
the brokers and usurers got estates, and many
thousands of tradesmen were brought to no∣thing;
even those that stood it, lost great sums
of money by selling their tallies: but credit
cannot be bought too dear; and the throwing
away one half to save the other, was much
better than sinking under the burthen; like a
sailor in a storm, who to lighten the ship wal∣lowing
in the trough of the sea, will throw
the choicest goods over-board, even to half the
cargo, in order to keep the ship above water,
and save their lives.</P>
<P>THESE were terrible examples of <HI>over-trading</HI>
indeed; the men were tempted by the high
price which the government gave for their
goods, and which they were oblig'd to give, be∣cause
of the badness of the publick credit at
that time; But this was not sufficient to make
good the loss sustain'd in the sale of the tallies,
so that even they that sold and were able to
stand without ruin, were yet great sufferers, and
had enough to do to keep up their credit.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="96"/>
THIS was the effect of giving over much cre∣dit;
for tho' it was the government itself which
they trusted, yet neither could the government
itself keep up the sinking credit of those whom
it was indebted to; and indeed, how should it,
when it was not able to support its own credit?
But that by the way. I return to the young
tradesman, whom we are now speaking about.</P>
<P>IT is his greatest prudence therefore, after he
has consider'd his own fund, and the stock he
has to rest upon; I say, his next business is to
take care of his credit, and next to limiting
his buying-liberty, let him be sure to limit his
selling; could the tradesman buy all upon cre∣dit,
and sell all for ready money, he might
turn usurer, and put his own stock out to in∣terest,
or buy land with it, for he would have
no occasion for one shilling of it: but since
that is not expected, nor can be done, it is his
business to act with prudence in both parts, I
mean, of taking and giving credit; and the best
rule to be given him for it is, never to give so
much credit as he takes, by at least one third
part.</P>
<P>BY giving credit I do not mean, that even all
the goods which he buys upon credit may not
be sold upon credit; perhaps they are goods
which are usually sold so, and no otherwise:
but the alternative is before him thus; either he
must not give so much credit in quantity of
goods, or not so long credit in relation to time:
for example,</P>
<P>SUPPOSE the young tradesman buys ten thou∣sand
pounds value of goods on credit, and this
<PB N="80" REF="97"/>
ten thousand pounds are sold for eleven thousand
pounds likewise on credit; if the time given
be the same, the man is in a state of apparent
destruction, and 'tis a hundred to one but he is
blown up; perhaps he owes the ten thousand
pound to twenty men, perhaps the eleven thou∣sand
pound is owing to him by two hundred
men: it is scarce possible that these two hun∣dred
petty customers of his, should all so punctu∣ally
comply with their payments, as to enable
him to comply with his; and if two or three
thousand pounds fall short, the poor tradesman,
unless he has a fund to support the deficiency,
must be undone.</P>
<P>BUT if the man had bought ten thousand
pounds at six or eight months credit, and had
sold them all again as above to his two hundred
customers, at three months and four months
credit, then it might be supposed all, or the
greatest part of them, would have paid time e∣nough
to make his payments good; if not, all
would be lost still.</P>
<P>BUT on the other hand, suppose he had sold
but three thousand pounds worth of the ten for
ready money, and had sold the rest for six months
credit; it might be suppos'd that the three thou∣sand
pounds in cash, and what else the two
hundred debtors might pay in time, might stop
the mouths of the tradesman's creditors, 'till the
difference might be made good.</P>
<P>SO easy a thing is it for a tradesman to lose
his credit in trade, and so hard is it once upon
such a blow to retrieve it again: what need then
is there for the tradesman to guard himself a∣gainst
<PB N="81" REF="98"/>
running too far into debt, or letting o∣ther
people run too far into debt to him; for
if they do not pay him, he cannot pay others,
and the next thing is a commission of bank∣rupt,
and so the tradesman may be undone,
tho' he has eleven thousand pound to pay ten
with.</P>
<P>IT is true, it is not possible in a country
where there is such an infinite extent of trade
as we see manag'd in this kingdom, that ei∣ther
on one hand or another it can be carried
on, without a reciprocal credit both taken and
given; but it is so nice an article, that I am
of opinion, as many tradesmen break with giving
too much credit, as break with taking it. The
danger indeed is mutual, and very great: what∣ever
then the young tradesman omits, let him
guard against both his giving and taking too much
credit.</P>
<P>BUT there are divers ways of over-trading,
besides this of taking and giving too much credit;
and one of these is the running out into projects
and heavy undertakings, either out of the com∣mon
road which the tradesman is already engaged
in, or grasping at too many undertakings at
once, and having, as it is vulgarly express'd, too
many irons in the fire at a time; in both which
cases the tradesman is often wounded, and that
deeply, sometimes too deep to recover.</P>
<P>THE consequences of those adventures are
generally such as these; first, that they stock-starve
the tradesman, and impoverish him in his
ordinary business, which is the main support of
his family; they lessen his strength, and while
<PB N="82" REF="99"/>
his trade is not lessen'd, yet his stock is lessen'd;
and as they very rarely add to his credit, so if they
lessen the man's stock, they weaken him in the
main, and he must at last faint under it.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, as they lessen his stock, so they
draw from it in the most sensible part; they
wound him in the tenderest and most nervous
part; for they always draw away his ready mo∣ney:
and what follows? The money, which was
before the sinews of his business, the life of his
trade, maintain'd his shop, and kept up his cre∣dit
in the full extent of it, being drawn off, like
the blood let out of the veins, his trade lan∣guishes,
his credit by degrees flags and goes off,
and the tradesman falls under the weight.</P>
<P>THUS have I seen many a flourishing trades∣man
sensibly decay; his credit has first a little
suffer'd, then for want of that credit trade has
declin'd; that is to say, he has been obliged to
trade for less and less, 'till at last he is wasted and
reduc'd: if he has been wise enough and wary e∣nough
to draw out betimes, and avoid breaking,
he has yet come out of trade, like an old <HI>inva∣lid</HI>
soldier out of the wars, maim'd, bruis'd, sick
reduc'd, and fitter for an hospital than a shop;
such miserable havock has launching out into
projects and remote undertakings made among
tradesmen.</P>
<P>BUT the safe tradesman is he, that avoiding
all such remote excursions, keeps close within
the verge of his own affairs; minds his shop or
warehouse, and confining himself to what be∣longs
to him there, goes on in the road of his
business without launching into unknown oce∣ans;
<PB N="83" REF="100"/>
and content with the gain of his own trade,
is neither led by ambition, or avarice; and nei∣ther
covets to be greater or richer by such un∣certain
and hazardous attempts.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Tradesman in distress, and becom∣ing
Bankrupt.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N former times it was a dismal and cala∣mitous
thing for a tradesman <HI>to break:</HI>
where it befell a family, it put all into
confusion and distraction; the man in the utmost
terror, fright, and distress, ran away with what
goods he could get off, as if the house was on
fire, to get into the <HI>Fryars,</HI> or the <HI>Mint;</HI> the
family fled <HI>one</HI> one way, and <HI>one</HI> another, like
people in desperation; the wife to her father
and mother, <HI>if she had any,</HI> and the children
some to one relation, some to another; a sta∣tute
(so they vulgarly call a commission of bank∣rupt)
came and swept away all, and oftentimes
consum'd it too, and left little or nothing, ei∣ther
to pay the creditors, or relieve the bank∣rupt.
This made the bankrupt desperate, and
made him fly to those places of shelter with his
<PB N="84" REF="101"/>
goods, where, harden'd by the cruelty of the
creditors, he chose to spend all the effects which
should have paid the creditors, and at last perish'd
in misery.</P>
<P>But now the case is alter'd: men make so
little of breaking, that many times the family
scarce removes for it; a commission of bank∣rupt
is so familiar a thing, that the debtor often∣times
causes it to be taken out in his favour,
that he may the sooner be effectually deliver'd
from all his creditors at once, the law obliging
him only to give a full account of himself up∣on
oath to the commissioners, who, when they
see his integrity, may effectually deliver him
from all farther molestation, give him a part e∣ven
of the creditor's estate, and so he may push
into the world again, and try whether he can∣not
retrieve his fortunes by a better management,
or with better success for the future.</P>
<P>SOME have said, this law is too favourable to
the bankrupt; that it makes tradesmen care∣less;
that they value not breaking at all, but run
on at all hazards, venturing without forecast and
without consideration, knowing they may come
off again so cheap and so easie, if they miscar∣ry:
but though I cannot enter here into a long
debate upon that subject, yet I may have room
to say, that I differ from those people very much;
for though the terror of the commission is in
some measure abated, as indeed it ought to be,
because it was before exorbitant and unreasona∣ble;
yet the terror of ruining a man's family,
sinking his fortunes, blasting his credit, and
throwing him out of business, and into the worst
<PB N="85" REF="102"/>
of disgrace that a tradesman can fall into, this
is not taken away, or abated at all; and this
to an honest trading man is as bad as all the
rest ever was or could be.</P>
<P>NOR can a man be suppos'd in the rupture of
his affairs, to receive any comfort, or to see thro'
his disasters into the little relief which he may,
and at the same time cannot be sure he shall,
receive at the end of his troubles, from the
mercy of the commission.</P>
<P>THESE are poor things and very trifling, for
a tradesman to entertain thoughts of a breach
from, especially with any prospect of satisfacti∣on;
nor can any tradesman with the least sha∣dow;
of principle entertain any thought of break∣ing,
but with the utmost aversion, and even
abhorrence; for the circumstances of it are at∣tended
with so many mortifications, and so ma∣ny
shocking things, contrary to all the views
and expectations that a tradesman can begin the
world with, that he cannot think of it, but as
we do of the grave, with a chilness upon the
blood, and a tremor in the spirits. Breaking is
the death of a tradesman; he is mortally stabb'd,
or, as we may say, shot thro' the head in his
trading capacity; his shop is shut up, as it is
when a man is buried; his credit, the life
and blood of his trade, is stagnated; and his at∣tendance,
which was the pulse of his business,
is stopt, and beats no more; in a word, his
fame, and even name as to trade, is buried,
and the commissioners, that act upon him, and all
their proceedings, are but like the executors of the
defunct, dividing the ruins of his fortune, and
<PB N="86" REF="103"/>
at last, his certificate is a kind of performing
the obsequies for the dead, and praying him out
of purgatory.</P>
<P>DID ever tradesman set up on purpose to
break? Did ever a man build himself a house
on purpose to have it burnt down? I can by
no means grant that any tradesman, at least in
his senses, can entertain the least satisfaction in
his trading, or abate any thing of his diligence
in trade, from the easiness of breaking, or the
abated severities of the bankrupt act.</P>
<P>I cou'd argue it from the nature of the act it
self, which indeed was made, and is effectual,
chiefly for the relief of creditors, not debtors;
to secure the bankrupt's effects for the use of
those to whom it of right belongs, and to pre∣vent
the extravagant expences of the commis∣sion,
which before was such as often devour'd
all, ruining both the bankrupt and his creditors
too. This the present law has providently
put a stop to, and the creditors now are secure
in this point, that what is to be had, what the
poor tradesman has left, they are sure to have
preserv'd for, and divided among them, which
indeed before they were not: The case is so
well known, and so recent in every tradesman's
memory, that I need not take up any more of
your time about it.</P>
<P>AS to the encouragements in the act for the
bankrupt, they are only these, namely, that
upon his honest and faithful surrender of his
affairs, he shall be set at liberty; and if they see
cause, they, the creditors, may give him back a
small gratification for his discovering his effects,
<PB N="87" REF="104"/>
and assisting to the recovery of them; and all
this, which amounts to very little, is upon his
being, as I have said, entirely honest, and hav∣ing
run thro' all possible examinations and pur∣gations,
and that it is at the peril of his life if he
prevaricates.</P>
<P>ARE these encouragements to tradesmen to
be negligent and careless of the event of things?
Will any man in his wits fail in his trade,
break his credit, and shut up his shop for these
prospects? Or will he comfort himself in case
he is forced to fail, I say, will he comfort him∣self
with these little benefits, and make the
matter easy to himself on that account? He
must have a very mean spirit that can do this,
and must act upon very mean principles in life,
who can fall with satisfaction, on purpose to
rise no higher than this; 'tis like a man going
to bed on purpose to rise naked, pleasing him∣self
with the thoughts that tho' he shall have no
cloaths to put on, yet he shall have the liberty
to get out of bed and shift for himself.</P>
<P>ON these accounts, and some others, too long
to mention here, I think 'tis out of doubt that
the easiness of the proceedings on commissions
of bankrupt, can be no encouragement to any
tradesman to break, or so much as to entertain
the thoughts of it, with less horror and aver∣sion
than he would have done before this law
was made.</P>
<P>BUT I must come now to speak of the trades∣man
in his real state of mortification, and un∣der
the inevitable necessity of a blow upon his
affairs: He has had losses in his business, such
<PB N="88" REF="105"/>
as are too heavy for his stock to support; he
has perhaps launch'd out in trade beyond his
reach; either he has so many bad debts that he
cannot find by his books he has enough left to
pay his creditors; or his debts lie out of his
reach, and he can't get them in, <HI>which in one
respect is as bad;</HI> he has more bills running a∣gainst
him than he knows how to pay; and cre∣ditors
dunning him who it is hard for him to
comply with; and this by degrees sinks his
credit.</P>
<P>Now could the poor unhappy tradesman take
good advice, now would be his time to pre∣vent
his utter ruin, and let his case be better or
worse, his way is clear.</P>
<P>IF it be only that he has over-shot himself in
trade, taken too much credit, and is loaded
with goods; or given too much credit, and can∣not
get his debts in; but that upon casting up
his books he finds his circumstances good at bot∣tom,
tho' his credit has suffer'd by his effects
being out of his hands; let him endeavour to
retrench, let him check his carrier in trade;
immediately take some extraordinary measures
to get in his debts, or some extraordinary mea∣sures,
if he can, to raise money in the mean
time, till those debts come in, that he may stop
the crowd of present demands; if this will not
do, let him treat with some of his principal cre∣ditors,
shewing them a true and faithful state of
his affairs, and giving them the best assurances
he can of payment, that they may be easy with
him till he can get in his debts; and then with
the utmost care draw in his trade within the
<PB N="89" REF="106"/>
due compass of his stock, and be sure never to
run out again farther than he is able to answer,
let the prospect of advantage be what it will;
and by this method he may perhaps recover his
credit again; at least he may prevent his ruin:
But this is always supposing the man has a firm
bottom, that he is sound in the main, and that
his stock is at least sufficient to pay all his
debts.</P>
<P>BUT the difficulty which I am proposing to
speak of, is when the poor tradesman, distress'd
<HI>as above</HI> in point of credit, looking into his
affairs, finds that his stock is diminished, or
perhaps entirely sunk; that in short he has
such losses, and such disappointments in his bu∣siness,
that he is not sound at bottom; that he
has run too far, and that his own stock being
wasted or sunk, he has not really sufficient to
pay his debts; what is this man's business? and
what course shall he take?</P>
<P>I know the ordinary course with such trades∣men
is this; it is true, says the poor man, I am
running down, and I have lost so much in such
a place, and so much by such a chapman that
broke, and in short, so much that I am worse
than nothing; <HI>but come,</HI> I have such a thing
before me, or I have undertaken such a project,
or I have such an adventure abroad, if it suc∣ceeds
I may recover again; I'll try my utmost
I'll never drown while I can swim; I'll never
fall while I can stand; who knows but I may
get over it? In a word, the poor man is loth to
come to the fatal day; loth to have his name
in the gazette<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and see his wife and family turn'd
<PB N="90" REF="107"/>
out of doors, and the like; who can blame
him? or who is not, in the like case, apt to
take the like measures? for 'tis natural to us all
to put the evil day far from us; at least, to put
it as far off as we can: tho' the criminal believes
he shall be executed at last, yet he accepts of
every reprieve, as it puts him within the possi∣bility
of an escape, and that as long as there is
life there is hopes; but at last, the dead warrant
comes down, then he sees death unavoidable,
and gives himself up to despair.</P>
<P>INDEED the malefactor was in the right to ac∣cept,
as I say, of every reprieve; but it is quite
otherwise in the tradesman's case; and if I may
give him a rule, safe, and in its end comfortable,
in proportion to his circumstances, but to be
sure, out of question just, honest and prudent, it
is this:</P>
<P>WHEN he perceives his case as above, and
knows that if his new adventures or projects
should fail, he cannot by any means stand or
support himself, I not only give it as my advice
to all tradesmen, as their interest, but insist upon
it, as they are honest men they should break; that
is, stop in time; Fear not to do that which ne∣cessity
obliges you to do; but above all, fear
not to do that early, which if omitted, necessity
will oblige you to do late.</P>
<P>FIRST, let me argue upon the honesty of it,
and next upon the prudence of it. Certainly
honesty obliges every man, when he sees that
his stock is gone, that he is below the level,
and eating into the estates of other men, to put a
stop to it; and to do it in time, while something
<PB N="91" REF="108"/>
is left. It has been a fault, without doubt, to
break in upon other mens estates at all; but per∣haps
a plea may be made that it was ignorantly
done, and they did not think they were run so
far, as to be worse than nothing; or some sud∣den
disaster may have occasion'd it, which they
did not expect, and it may be cou'd not foresee;
both which may indeed happen to a tradesman,
tho' <HI>the former</HI> can hardly happen without his
fault, because he ought to be always acquaint∣ing
himself with his books, stating his expences
and his profits, and casting things up frequently,
at least in his head, so as always to know whe∣ther
he goes backward or forward. <HI>The latter,</HI>
namely, sudden disaster, may happen so to any
tradesman as that he may be undone, and it
may not be his fault; for ruin sometimes falls as
suddenly as unavoidably upon a tradesman, tho'
there are but very few incidents of that kind,
which may not be accounted for in such a man∣ner
as to charge it upon his prudence.</P>
<P>SOME cases may indeed happen, some disas∣ters
may befall a tradesman, which it was not
possible he should foresee; as fire, floods of
water, thieves, and many such; and in those
cases the disaster is visible, the plea is open, eve∣ry
body allows it, the man can have no blame.
A prodigious tide from the sea, join'd with a
great fresh or flood in the river <HI>Dee,</HI> destroy'd
the new wharf below the <HI>Roodee</HI> at <HI>West Ches∣ter,</HI>
and tore down the merchants warehouses
there, and drove away not only all the goods,
but even the buildings and all together, into
the sea; Now, if a poor shop-keeper in <HI>Chester</HI>
<PB N="92" REF="109"/>
had a large parcel of goods lying there, perhaps
newly landed in order to be brought up to the
city, but were all swept away, if, <HI>I say,</HI> the poor
tradesman was ruin'd by the loss of those goods
on that occasion, the creditors would see reason
in it that they should every one take a share in
the loss; the tradesman was not to blame.</P>
<P>LIKEWISE in the distress of the late fire which
began in <HI>Thames-street,</HI> near <HI>Bear-key,</HI> a grocer
might have had a quantity of goods in a ware∣house
thereabouts, or his shop might be there,
and the goods perhaps might be sugars, or cur∣rants,
or tobacco, or any other goods in his way,
which cou'd not be easily remov'd; this fire
was a surprize, it was a blast of powder, it was
at noon-day, when no person cou'd forsee it;
the man may have been undone and be in no
fault himself, one way or other; no man can
reasonably say to him, why did you keep so
many goods upon your hands, or in such a
place? for it was his proper business both to
have a stock of goods, and to have them in
such a place; every thing was in the right po∣sition,
and in the order which the nature of his
rade requir'd.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, if it was the breaking of
a particular chapman, or an adventure by sea,
the creditors would perhaps reflect on his pru∣dence,
why should any man trust a single chap∣man
so much, or adventure so much in one sin∣gle
bottom, and uninsur'd, as that the loss of it
would be his undoing?</P>
<P>BUT there are other (however) cases which may
happen to a tradesman; and by which he may be at
<PB N="93" REF="110"/>
once reduc'd below his proper stock, and have
nothing lest to trade on but his credit, that is to
say, the estates of his creditors; In such a case,
I question whether it can be honest for any man
to continue trading; for first, it is making his
creditors run an unjust hazard without their con∣fent;
indeed, if he discovers his condition to
one or two of them, who are men of capital
stocks, and will support him, they giving him leave
to pay others off, and go on at their risques, that
alters the case; or if he has a ready money trade,
that will apparently raise him again, and he runs
no more hazards, but is sure he shall at least
run out no farther; in these two cases (and I
do not know another) he may with honesty
continue.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, when he sees himself evi∣dently
running out, and declining, and has on∣ly
a shift here, and a shift there; to lay hold on,
as sinking men generally do; and knows, that
unless something extraordinary happen, which
perhaps also is not probable, he must fall; for
such a man to go on, and trade in the ordinary
way, notwithstanding losses, and hazards, in such
a case I affirm he cannot act the honest man, he
cannot go on with justice to his creditors or his
family; he ought to call his creditors together,
lay his circumstances honestly before them, and
pay as far as it will go; if his creditors will do
any thing generously for him, to enable him to
go on again, well and good, but he cannot ho∣nestly
oblige them to run the risque of his un∣fortunate
progress, and to venture their estates
on his bottom, after his bottom is really no∣thing
at all but their money.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="111"/>
BUT I pass from the honesty to the prudence
of it; from what regards his creditors, to what
regards himself; and I affirm, nothing can be
more imprudent and impolitick, as it regards
himself and his family, than to go on after he
sees his circumstances irrecoverable. If he has
any consideration for himself, or his future hap∣piness,
he will stop in time, and not be afraid
of meeting the mischief which he sees follows
too fast for him to escape: be not so afraid of
breaking, as not to break 'till necessity forces
you, and that you have nothing left; in a word,
I speak it to every declining tradesman, if you
love yourself, your family, or your reputation,
and would ever hope to look the world in the
face again, <HI>break</HI> in time.</P>
<P>BY breaking in time you will first obtain the
character of an honest, tho' unfortunate man;
'tis owing to the contrary course, which is in∣deed
the ordinary practice of tradesmen, name∣ly,
not to break 'till they run the bottom quite
out, and have little or nothing left to pay; I
say, 'tis owing to this, that some people think
all men that break are knaves; the censure 'tis
true is unjust; but the cause is owing to the
indiscretion,
to call it no worse, of the poor
tradesmen, who putting the mischief as far from
them as they can, trade on to the last gasp; 'till
a throng of creditors coming on them together,
or being arrested, and not able to get bail,
or by some such publick blow to their credit, they
are brought to a stop or breach of course; like a
man fighting to the last gasp who is knock'd down,
and laid on the ground, and then his resistance
<PB N="95" REF="112"/>
is at an end; for indeed a tradesman pushing on
under irresistible misfortunes is but fighting with
the world to the last drop, and with such une∣qual
odds, that like the soldier surrounded with
enemies, he must be kill'd; so the debtor must
sink, it cannot be prevented.</P>
<P>IT is true also, the man that thus struggles to the
last, brings upon him an universal reproach, and
a censure, that is not only unavoidable, but
just, which is worse; but when a man breaks
in time, he may hold up his face to his credit∣ors,
and tell them, that he could have gone on
a considerable while longer, but that he should
have had less left to pay them with, and that
he has chosen to stop while he may be able to
give them so considerable a sum, as may con∣vince
them of his integrity.</P>
<P>WE have a great clamour among us of the
cruelty of creditors; and it is a popular cla∣mour,
that goes a great way with some people;
but let them tell us when ever creditors were
cruel, when the debtor came thus to them with
15 <HI>s.</HI> in the pound in his offer; perhaps when
the debtor has run to the utmost, and there ap∣pears
to be little or nothing left, he has been
us'd roughly, and 'tis enough to provoke a cre∣ditor
indeed to be offer'd a shilling or half a
crown in the pound for a large debt, when had
the debtor been honest, and broke in time, they
might have receiv'd perhaps two thirds of their
debt, and the debtor been in better condition
too.</P>
<P>BREAK then in time, young tradesman! if
you see you are going down, and that the ha∣zard
<PB N="96" REF="113"/>
of going on is doubtful; you will certain∣ly
be receiv'd by your creditors with compassi∣on,
and with a generous treatment; and whatever
happens, you will be able to begin the world
again with the title of an honest man; even
the same creditors will embark with you again,
and be more forward to give you credit than
before.</P>
<P>IT is true, most tradesmen that break merit the
name of knave or dishonest man, but 'tis not so
with all; the reason of the difference lies chiefly
in the manner of their breaking, <HI>viz.</HI> whether
sooner or later: It is possible, he may be an honest
man who <HI>cannot,</HI> but he can never be honest
that can, and <HI>will not</HI> pay his debts. Now he,
that being able to pay fifteen shillings in the pound,
will struggle on 'till he sees he shall not be able to
pay half a crown in the pound, this man was
able to pay, but would not; and therefore, as
above, cannot be an honest man.</P>
<P>IN the next place, what shall we say to the
peace and satisfaction of mind in breaking, which
the tradesman will always have when he acts
the honest part, and breaks betimes; compared
to that guilt and chagrin of the mind, occasi∣oned
by a running on, as I said, to the last
gasp, when they have little to pay? Then indeed
the tradesman can expect no quarter from his cre∣ditors,
and will have no quiet in himself.</P>
<P>I might instance here the miserable, anxious,
perplexed life, which the poor tradesman lives
under; the distresses and extremities of his de∣clining
state; how harass'd and tormented for
money; what shifts he is driven to for support∣ing
<PB N="97" REF="114"/>
himself; how many little, mean, and even
wicked things will even the religous tradesman
stoop to in his distress, to deliver himself, even
such things, as his very soul would abhor at
another time; and for which he goes perhaps
with a wounded conscience all his life after?</P>
<P>BY giving up early, all this, which is the most
dreadful part of all the rest, would be prevent∣ed.
I have heard many an honest unfortunate
man confess this, and repent, even with tears,
that they had not learn'd to despair in trade
some years sooner than they did, by which they
had avoided falling into many foul and foolish
actions, which they afterwards had been driven
to by the extremity of their affairs.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the ordinary Occasions of the Ruin of Tradesmen.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN I have, as in my last, given
advice to tradesmen, when they fall
into difficulties, and find they are run
behind-hand, to break in time, be∣fore
they run on too far, and thereby prevent
the consequences of a fatal running on to ex∣tremity,
'tis but just I should give them some
<PB N="98" REF="115"/>
needful directions, to avoid, if possible, break∣ing
at all.</P>
<P>IN order to this, I will briefly enquire what
are the ordinary originals of a tradesman's ruin
in business: to say 'tis <HI>negligence,</HI> when I have
<HI>already</HI> press'd to a close application and <HI>dili∣gence;</HI>
that 'tis launching into, and grasping at,
more business than their stock, or perhaps their
understandings are able to manage: when I
have <HI>already</HI> spoken of the fatal consequences
of over-trading; to say 'tis trusting carelesly
people unable to pay, and running too rashly
into debt: when I have <HI>already spoken</HI> of tak∣ing
and giving too much credit; this would all
be but saying the same thing over again; and I
am too full of particulars, in this important
case, to have any need of tautologies and repe∣titions:
but there are a great many ways by
which tradesmen precipitate themselves into
ruin, besides those, and some that need explain∣ing
and enlarging upon.</P>
<P>1. SOME, <HI>especially retailers,</HI> ruin themselves
by fixing their shops in such places as are im∣proper
for their business. In most towns, but
particularly in the city of <HI>London,</HI> there are
places as it were appropriated to particular trades,
and where the trades which are plac'd there
succeed very well, but would do very ill any
where else, or any other trades in the same
places; as the orange-merchants and wet-salters
about <HI>Billingsgate,</HI> and in <HI>Thames-sttreet;</HI> the
costermongers at the <HI>Three Cranes;</HI> the whole∣sale
cheesemongers in <HI>Thames-street;</HI> the mer∣cers
and drapers in the high streets, such as
<PB N="99" REF="116"/>
<HI>Cheapside, Ludgate-street, Cornhill, Round-court,</HI>
and <HI>Gracechurch-street, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>PRAY what would a bookseller make of his
business at <HI>Billingsgate,</HI> or a mercer in <HI>Tower∣street,</HI>
or near the <HI>Custom-house;</HI> or a draper in
<HI>Thames-sreet,</HI> or about <HI>Queen-hithe?</HI> Many
trades have their peculiar streets, and proper
places for the sale of their goods, where people
expect to find such shops; and consequently,
when they want such goods, they go thither for
them; as the booksellers in <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s church∣yard,
about the <HI>Exchange, Temple</HI> and: the
<HI>Strand, &amp;c.</HI> the mercers on both sides <HI>Ludgate,</HI>
in <HI>Round-court,</HI> and <HI>Gracechurch</HI> and <HI>Lombard-streets;</HI>
the shoemakers in <HI>St. Martins le grand,</HI>
and <HI>Shoemaker-row;</HI> the coachmakers in <HI>Long∣acre,
Queen-street,</HI> and <HI>Bishopsgate;</HI> butchers in
<HI>Eastcheap,</HI> and such like.</P>
<P>FOR a tradesman to open his shop in a place
unresorted-to, or in a place where his trade is
not agreeable, and where 'tis not expected, 'tis
no wonder if he has no trade. What retale
trade would a milliner have among the fish∣mongers
shops on <HI>Fishstreet-hill;</HI> or a toy-man
about <HI>Queen-hithe?</HI> When a shop is ill chosen,
the tradesman starves, he is out of the way,
and business will not follow him that runs away
from it: suppose a ship-chandler should set up
in <HI>Holbourn,</HI> or a block-maker in <HI>Whitecross-street,</HI>
an anchor-smith at <HI>Moorgate,</HI> or a coach∣maker
in <HI>Redriff,</HI> and the like?</P>
<P>IT is true, we have seen a kind of fate at∣tend
the very streets and rows where such trades
have been gather'd together; and a street famous
<PB N="100" REF="117"/>
some years ago, shall, in a few years after, be
quite forsaken; as <HI>Pater-noster-row</HI> for mercers,
<HI>St. Paul</HI>'s church yard for woollen-drapers, both
the <HI>Eastcheaps</HI> for butchers; and now you see
hardly any of those trades lest in those places.</P>
<P>I mention it for this reason, and this makes
it to my purpose in an extraordinary manner,
that whenever the principal shop-keepers re∣move
from such a street, or settled place where
the principal trade used to be, the rest soon
follow; knowing, that if the fame of the trade
is not there, the customers will not resort thi∣ther:
and that a tradesman's business is to fol∣low
wherever the trade leads. For a mercer to
set up now in <HI>Pater-noster-row,</HI> or a woollen
draper in <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s church-yard; the one among
the semstresses, and the other among the chair∣makers;
would be the same thing as for a count∣ry
shop-keeper not to set up in or near the
market-place.</P>
<P>THE place therefore is to be prudently chosen
by the retailer, when he first begins his business,
that he may put himself in the way of business;
and then, with God's blessing, and his own care,
he may expect his share of trade with his neigh∣bours.</P>
<P>2. HE must take an especial care to have his
shop not so much crouded with a large bulk of
goods, as with a well-sorted, and well-chosen
quantity, proper for his business, and to give
credit to his beginning; in order to this, his
buying part requires not only a good judgment
in the wares he is to deal in, but a perfect go∣vernment
of his judgment by his understanding
<PB N="101" REF="118"/>
to suit and sort his quantities and proportions,
as well to his shop, as to the particular place
where his shop is situate; for example, a parti∣cular
trade is not only proper for such or such
a part of the town, but a particular sortment
of goods, even in the same way, suits one part
of the town, or one town and not another; as
he that sets up in the <HI>Strand,</HI> or near the <HI>Ex∣change,</HI>
is likely to sell more rich silks, more
fine hollands, more fine broad-cloths, more fine
toys and trinkets, than one of the same trade,
setting up in the skirts of the town, or at <HI>Rat∣cliff,</HI>
or <HI>Wapping,</HI> or <HI>Redriff;</HI> and he that sets
up in the capital city of a county, than he that
is plac'd in a private market-town, in the same
county; and he that is placed in a market-town,
than he that is plac'd in a country village.
A tradesman in a sea-port town sorts himself
different from one of the same trade in an in∣land
town, tho' larger and more populous; and
this the tradesman must weigh very maturely
before he lays out his stock.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES it happens a tradesman serves his
apprenticeship in one town, and sets up in an∣other;
and sometimes circumstances altering, he
removes from one town to another; the change
is very important to him, for the goods which
he is to sell in the town he removes to, are
sometimes so differing from the sorts of goods
which he sold in the place he removed from,
tho' in the same way of trade, that he is at a
great loss both in changing his hand, and in the
judgment of buying. This made me insist, in
one of my letters, that a tradesman should take
<PB N="102" REF="119"/>
all occasions to extend his knowledge in every
kind of goods, that which way soever he may
turn his hand, he may have judgment in every
thing.</P>
<P>IN thus changing his circumstances of trade, he
must learn, as well as he 'can, how to furnish his
shop suitable to the place he is to trade in, and
to sort his goods to the demand which he is
like to have there; otherwise he will not only
lose the customers for want of proper goods,
but will very much lose by the goods which he
lays in for sale, there being no demand for
them where he is going.</P>
<P>WHEN merchants send adventures to our <HI>Bri∣tish</HI>
colonies, 'tis usual with them to make up
to each factor what they call a <HI>sortable cargoe;</HI>
that is to say, they want something of every
thing that may furnish the tradesmen there with
parcels fit to fill their shops, and invite their
customers; and if they fail, and do not thus
sort their cargoes, the factors there not only
complain, as being ill-sorted, but the cargoe
lies by unsold, because there is not a sufficient
quantity of sorts to answer the demand, and
make them all marketable together.</P>
<P>IT is the same thing here; if the tradesman's
shop is not well sorted, it is not suitably fur∣nished,
or fitted to supply his customers; and
nothing dishonours him more than to have
people come to buy things usual to be had in
such shops, and go away without them. The
next thing they say to one another is, I went to
that shop, but I could not be furnish'd; they are
not stock'd there for a trade; one seldom finds
<PB N="103" REF="120"/>
any thing there that is new or fashionable:
and so they go away to another shop; and not
only go away themselves, but carry others away
with them, for it is observable, that the buyers,
or retale customers, especially the Ladies, follow
one another as sheep follow the flock; and if one
buys a beautiful silk, or a cheap piece of <HI>Holland,</HI>
or a new-fashioned thing of any kind, the next en∣quiry
is, where it was bought? and the shop is pre∣sently
recommended for a shop well sorted, and
for a place where things are to be had not only
cheap and good, but of the newest fashion,
and where they have always great choice to
please the curious, and to supply whatever is
call'd for. And thus the trade runs way insen∣sibly
to the shops which are best sorted.</P>
<P>3. THE retale tradesman in especial, but even
every tradesman in his station, must furnish him∣self
with a competent stock of patience; I mean
that patience which is needful to bear with all
sorts of impertinence, and the most provoking
curiosity that it is possible to imagin the buyers,
even the worst of them, are or can be guilty
of. A tradesman behind his counter must have
no flesh and blood about him, no passions, no
resentment; he must never be angry, no not so
much as seem to be so: if a customer tumbles
him five hundred pounds worth of goods, and
scarce bids money for any thing; nay, tho'
they really come to his shop with no intent to
buy, as many do, only to see what is to be
sold, and if they cannot be better pleas'd than
they are at some other shop where they intend
to buy, 'tis all one, the tradesman must take it,
<PB N="104" REF="121"/>
and place it to the account of his calling, that
'tis his business to be ill used and resent no∣thing;
and so must answer as obligingly to
those that give him an hour or two's trouble
and buy nothing, as he does to those who in
half the time lay out ten or twenty pounds.
The case is plain, 'tis his business to get money,
to sell and please, and if some do give him
trouble and do not buy, others make him a∣mends,
and do buy; and as for the trouble, 'tis
the business of his shop.</P>
<P>I have heard that some Ladies, and those too
persons of good note, have taken their coaches
and spent a whole afternoon in <HI>Ludgatestreet,</HI>
or <HI>Covent Garden,</HI> only to divert themselves in
going from one mercer's shop to another, to
look upon their fine silks, and to rattle and
banter the journeymen and shopkeepers, and
have not so much as the least occasion, much
less intention to buy any thing; nay, not so
much as carrying any money out with them to
buy any thing if they fancied it: yet this the
mercers who understand themselves know their
business too well to resent, nor if they really
knew it, would they take the least notice of it,
but perhaps tell the ladies they were welcome
to look upon their goods; that it was their bu∣siness
to shew them, and that if they did not
come to buy now, they might perhaps see they
were furnish'd to please them when they might
have occasion.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, I have been told that
sometimes those sorts of ladies have been catch'd
in their own share; that is to say, have been so
<PB N="105" REF="122"/>
engaged by the good usage of the shop-keeper,
and so unexpectedly surpriz'd with some fine
thing or other, that has been shewn them, that
they have been drawn in by their fancy, against
their design, to lay out money, whether they
had it or no; that is to say, to buy, and send
home for money to pay for it.</P>
<P>BUT let it be how and which way it will,
whether mercer or draper, or what trade you
please, the man that stands behind the counter
must be all courtesy, civility and good man∣ners;
he must not be affronted, or any way
moved by any manner of usage, whether owing
to casualty or design; if he sees himself ill used,
he must wink, and not see it; he must at least
not appear to see it, nor any way shew dislike
or distaste; if he does, he reproaches not only
himself, but his shop, and puts an ill name up∣on
the general usage of customers in it; and 'tis
not to be imagined how, in this gossiping Tea-drinking
age, the scandal will run, even among
people who have had no knowledge of the per∣son
first complaining. Such a shop! (says a cer∣tain
Lady to a citizen's wife, in conversation as
they were going to buy clothes) I am resolv'd I
won't go to it, the fellow that keeps it is saucy
and rude: if I lay out my money, I expect to
be well used; if I don't lay it out, I expect to
be well treated.</P>

talk of the whole circle, and all the Ladies took
notice of it, and said they would take care to
shun that shop.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>SURE, Madam, the Lady was strangely
used; did she tell any of the particulars?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I did not understand that she told
the particulars, for it seems it was not to her,
but to some other Lady, a friend of hers; but it
was all one, the company took as much notice
of it as if it had been to her, and resented it
as much, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>YES, and without examining the truth
of the fact.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>WE did not doubt the story.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="107" REF="124"/>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT had no other proof of it, Madam,
than her relation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHY that's true; no body ask'd for a
proof; 'twas enough to tell the story.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHAT! tho' perhaps the Lady did not
know the person, or whether it was true or
no; and perhaps had it from a third or fourth
hand; your Ladiship knows any body's credit
may be blasted at that rate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>WE don't enquire so nicely, you
know, into the truth of stories at a Tea-table.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Madam, that's true; but when re∣putation
is at stake, we should be a little care∣ful
too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHY that's true too; but why are
you so concern'd about it, Madam! Do you
know the man that keeps the shop?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>No otherwise, Madam, than that I
have often bought there, and I always found
them the most civil obliging people in the
world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>IT may be they know you, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am persuaded they don't, for I seldom
went but I saw new faces; for they have a great
many servants and journeymen in the shop.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be you are easiy to be pleas'd;
you are good-humour'd your self, and cannot
put their patience to any trial.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>INDEED, Madam, just the contrary;
I believe I made them tumble two or three
hundred pounds worth of goods one day, and
bought nothing, and yet it was all one, they
used me as well as if I had laid out twenty
pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="108" REF="125"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHY so they ought.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>YES, Madam, but then 'tis a token they
do as they ought, and understand themselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, I don't know much of it in∣deed,
but thus I was told.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, but if your Ladiship would
know the truth of it, you would do a piece of
justice to go and try them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>NOT I! besides, I have a mercer of
my acquaintance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, Madam, I'll wait on your La∣diship
to your own mercer, and if you can't
find any thing to your liking, will you go and try the other shop?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! I am sure I shall deal if I go to
my mercer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, but if you shou'd, let us go
for a frollick, and give t'other as much trouble
as we can for nothing, and see how he'll be∣have,
for I want to be satisfy'd; if I find them
as your Ladiship has been told, I'll never go
there any more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>UPON that condition I agree, I will
go with you; but I will go and lay out my
money at my own mercer's first, because I
won't be tempted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, Madam, I'll wait on your La∣diship
till you have laid out your Money.</P>
</SP>
<P>AFTER this discourse they drive away to the
mercer's shop where the Lady us'd to buy; and
when they came there the Lady was surpriz'd,
the shop was shut up, and no body to be seen.
The next door was a laceman's, and the jour∣neyman
<PB N="109" REF="126"/>
being at the door, the Lady sent her
servant to desire him to speak a word or two
to her; and when he came, says the Lady to
him,</P>
<P>PRAY how long has Mr.—<HI>d</HI>'s shop
been shut up?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laceman.</SPEAKER>
<P>About a month, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHAT is Mr.—dead?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lacem.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Madam, he is not dead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHAT then, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lacem.</SPEAKER>
<P>SOMETHING worse, Madam, he has
had some misfortunes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very sorry to hear it, indeed—
So her Ladiship made her bow, and her coach∣man
drove away.</P>
</SP>
<P>THE short of the story was, her mercer was
broke; upon which the city Lady prevail'd up∣on
her Ladiship to go to the other shop;
which she did, but declar'd beforehand she
would buy nothing, but give the mercer all
the trouble she could; and so said the other.
And to make the thing more sure, she would
have them go into the shop single, because she
fancy'd the mercer knew the city Lady, and
therefore would behave more civilly to them
both on that account, the other having laid out
her money there several times. Well, they
went in, and the Lady ask'd for such and such rich
things, and had them shew'd her, to a variety
that she was surpriz'd at; but not the best or
richest things they could shew her gave her any
satisfaction; either she did not like the pattern,
or the colours did not suit her fancy, or they
<PB N="110" REF="127"/>
were too dear; and so she prepares to leave
the shop, her coach standing at a distance, which
she order'd, that they might not guess at her
quality.</P>
<P>BUT she was quite deceiv'd in her expecta∣tion;
for the mercer, far from treating her
in the manner as she had heard, used her with
the utmost civility and good manners. She
treated him, on the contrary, as she said her
self, even with a forced rudeness; she gave him
all the impertinent trouble she was able, as a∣bove;
and, pretending to like nothing he shew'd,
turn'd away with an air of contempt, intimat∣ing
that his shop was ill furnish'd, and that she
should be easily served, she doubted not, at an∣other.</P>
<P>HE told her he was very unhappy in not hav∣ing
any thing that suited her fancy; that if she
knew what particular things would please her,
he would have them in two hours time for her
if all the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> merchants ware∣houses
in <HI>London,</HI> or all the weavers looms in
<HI>Spittlefields</HI> could furnish them. But when that
would not do, she comes forward from his
back-shop, where she had plagued him about an
hour and half, and makes him the slight com∣pliment
of, (in a kind of a scornful tone too,)
<HI>I am sorry I have given you so much trouble.</HI></P>
<P>THE trouble, Madam, is nothing, 'tis my
misfortune not to please you; but as to trouble,
my business is to oblige the Ladies my customers;
if I shew my goods, I may sell them; if I do
not shew them, I cannot: if it is not a trouble
to you, I'll shew you ever piece of goods in
<PB N="111" REF="128"/>
my shop; if you do not buy now, you may
perhaps buy another time. And thus, in short,
he pursued her with all the good words in the
world, and waited on her towards the door.</P>
<P>As she comes forward, there she spy'd the
city Lady, who had just us'd the partner as the
Lady had us'd the chief master; and there, as
if it had been by mere chance, she salutes her
with, Your servant, cousin, pray what brought
you here? The cousin answers, Madam, I am
mighty glad to see your Ladiship here; I have
been haggling here a good while, but this gen∣tleman
and I can't bargain, and I was just a go∣ing
away.</P>
<P>WHY then, says the Lady, you have been
just such another customer as I, for I have troub∣led
the gentleman mercer this two hours, and I
can't meet with any thing to my mind. So a∣way
they go together to the door, and the La∣dy
gets the mercer to send one of his servants
to bid her coachman drive to the door, shewing
him where the fellow stood.</P>
<P>WHILE the boy was gone, she takes the city
Lady aside, and talking softly, the mercer and
his partner, seeing them talk together, with∣drew;
but waited at a distance to be ready to
hand them to the coach. So they began a new
discourse, as follows:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, says she to the city Lady, I
am satisfy'd this man has been ill used in the
world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHY, Madam, how does your Ladiship
find him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only the most obliging, most gentle∣man-like
<PB N="112" REF="129"/>
man, of a tradesman, that ever I met
with in my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT did your Ladiship try him as you
said you would?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>TRY him! I believe he has tumbled
three thousand pounds worth of goods for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>DID you oblige him to do so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I forced him to it indeed, for I lik'd
nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is he well stock'd with goods?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told him his shop was ill furnished.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHAT did he say to that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>SAY! why he carried me into ano∣ther
inner-shop, or warehouse, where he had
goods to a surprising quantity and value, I con∣fess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND what could you say then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>SAY! in truth I was asham'd to say
any more; but still was resolv'd not to be pleas'd,
and so came away, as you see.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>And he has not disoblig'd you at all,
has he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just the contrary, indeed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here she repeated the words the mercer had said to her, and the modesty and civility he had treated her with.</NOTE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, Madam, I assure you I have
been faithful to my promise, for you can't have used him so ill as I have used his partner; for
I have perfectly abused him for having nothing
to please me; I did as good as tell him I believ'd
he was going to break, and that he had no
choice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="113" REF="130"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND how did he treat you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>JUST in the same manner as his partner
did your Ladiship, all mild and mannerly, smiling,
and in perfect temper; for my part, if I was a
young wench again, I should be in love with
such a man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, but what shall we do now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHY be gone, I think, we have teaz'd
them enough; 'twould be cruel to Bear-bait
them any more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I am not for teazing them any
more; but shall we really go away and buy no∣thing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>NAY, that shall be just as your Ladi∣ship
pleases; you know I promis'd you I would
not buy; that is to say, unless you discharge me of that obligation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't for shame go out of his shop
and lay out nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>DID your Ladiship see any thing that
pleas'd you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I only saw some of the finest things
in <HI>England;</HI> I don't think all the city of <HI>Paris</HI>
can outdo him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cit.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, Madam, if you resolve to buy,
let us go and look again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come then—and upon that the La∣dy
turning to the mercer, Come, Sir, says she,
I think I'll look upon that piece of brocade a∣gain,
I can't find in my heart to give you all
this trouble for nothing.</P>
</SP>
<P>MADAM, says the mercer, I shall be very
glad if I can be so happy as to please you; but I
besecch your Ladiship don't speak of the trouble,
<PB N="114" REF="131"/>
for that is the duty of our trade; we must ne∣ver
think our business a trouble.</P>
<P>UPON this the Ladies went back with him
into his inner-shop, and laid out between six∣ty
and seventy pounds, for they both bought
rich suits of cloths, and used his shop for many
years after.</P>
<P>THE short inference from this long discourse
is this, That here you see, and I could give
many examples very like this, how, and in what
manner, a shop-keeper is to behave himself in
the way of his business; what impertinences,
what taunts, flouts, and ridiculous things, he
must bear in his business, and must not shew the,
least return, or the least signal of disgust: he
must have no passions, no fire in his temper;
he must be all soft and smooth; nay, if his real
temper be naturally fiery and hot, he must shew
none of it in his shop; he must be a perfect
<HI>complete hypocrite,</HI> if he will be a <HI>complete
tradesman.</HI></P>
<P>IT is true, natural tempers are not to be al∣ways
counterfeited, the man cannot easily be
a lamb in his shop, and a lion in himself; but
let it be easy or hard, it must be done, and it is
done: there are men who have by custom and
usage brought themselves to it, that nothing
could be meeker and milder than they, when
behind the counter, and yet nothing be more fu∣rious
and racing in every other parr of life; nay,
the provocations they have met with in their
shops have so irritated their rage, that they
would go up stairs from their shop, and fall
into frenzies, and a kind of madness, and beat
<PB N="115" REF="132"/>
their heads against the wall, and mischief them∣selves,
if not prevented, till the violence of it
had gotten vent, and the passions abate and
cool. Nay, I heard once of a shop-keeper that
behav'd himself thus to such an extreme, that
when he was provok'd by the impertinence of
the customers, beyond what his temper could
bear, he would go up stairs and beat his
wife, kick his children about like dogs, and be
as furious for two or three minutes, as a man
chain'd down in <HI>Bedlam,</HI> and when the heat
was over, would sit down and cry faster than
the children he had abused; and after the fit
was over he would go down into his shop again,
and be as humble, as courteous, and as calm
as any man whatever; so absolute a government
of his passions had he in the shop, and so little
out of it; in the shop a soul-less animal that can
resent nothing, and in the family a madman;
in the shop meek like the lamb, but in the fa∣mily
outrageous like a <HI>Lybean</HI> lion.</P>
<P>THE sum of the matter is this, it is necessary
for a tradesman to subject himself, by all the ways
possible, to his buisness; his customers are to be
his idols: so far as he may worship idols by al∣lowance,
he is to bow down to them, and
worship them; at least, he is not any way to
displease them, or shew any disgust: or distaste at
any thing they say or do; the bottom of it all
is, that he is intending to get money by them;
and it is not for him that gets money by them
to offer the least inconvenience to them by
whom he gets it; but he is to consider, that as
<PB N="116" REF="133"/>
<HI>Solomon</HI> says, <HI>The borrower is servant to the lender,</HI> so the <HI>seller</HI> is servant to the <HI>buyer.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN a tradesman has thus conquered all
his passions, and can stand before the storm
of impertinence, he is said to be fitted up for
the main atticle, namely, the inside of the
counter.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, we see that the contra∣ry
temper, nay, but the very suggestion of it,
hurries people on to ruin their trade, to dis∣oblige
the customers, to quarrel with them, and
drive them away: we see by the Lady above,
after having seen the ways she had taken to put
this man out of temper; I say, you see it con∣quer'd
her temper, and brought her to lay out
her money chearfully, and be his customer ever
after.</P>
<P>A sowre, morose, dogmatick temper would
have sent these Ladies both away with their
money in their pockets; but the man's patience
and temper drove the Lady back to lay out her
money, and engaged her entirely.</P>

and first of innocent Diversions.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> FEW directions seasonably given, and
wisely received, will be sufficient to
guide a tradesman in a right manage∣ment
of his business, so as that, if he
observes them, he may secure his prosperity
and success: but it requires a long and serious
caveat to warn him of the dangers he meets
with in his way. Trade is a strait and direct
way, if they will but keep in it with a steady
foot, and not wander, and launch out here and
there, as a loose head and giddy fancy will
prompt them to do.</P>
<P>THE road, I say, is strait and direct; but there
are many turnings and openings in it, both to
the right hand and to the left, in which if a
tradesman, but once ventures to step awry, it is
ten thousand to one but he loses himself, and
very rarely finds his way back again; at least if
he does, 'tis like a man that has been lost in a
wood, he comes out with a scratch'd face, and
torn cloaths, tired and spent, and does not re∣cover
himself in a long while after.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="135"/>
IN a word, one steady motion carries him up,
but many things assist to pull him down; there
are many ways open, to his ruin, but few to his
rising; and tho' employment is said to be the
best fence against temptations, and he that is
busy heartily in his business, temptations to
idleness and negligence will not be so busy a∣bout
him; yet tradesmen are as often, drawn
from their business as other men, and when
they are so, it is more fatal to them a great
deal, than it is to gentlemen, and persons whose
employments do not call for their personal at∣tendance
so much as a shop does.</P>
<P>AMONG the many turnings and by-lanes
which, as I say, are to be met with in the strait
road of trade, there are two as dangerous and
fatal to their prosperity as the worst, tho' they
both carry an appearance of good, and promise
contrary to what they perform; these are,</P>
<P>I. PLEASURES and DIVERSIONS, especially
such as they will have us call <HI>innocent Diver∣sions.</HI></P>
<P>II. PROJECTS and ADVENTURES, and efpeci∣ally
such as promise mountains of profit <HI>in nu∣bibus,</HI>
and are therefore the more likely to en∣snare
the poor eager avaritious tradesman.</P>
<P>1. I am now to speak of the first, <HI>viz.</HI> plea∣sures
and diversions. I cannot allow any plea∣sures
to be innocent, when they turn away
either the body or rhe mind of a tradesman
from the one needful thing which his calling
<PB N="119" REF="136"/>
makes necessary, and that necessity makes his
duty; I mean, the application both of his
hands and head to his business; those pleasures
and diversions may he innocent in themselves,
which are not so to him: there are very few
things in the world that are simply evil, but
things are made circumstantially evil when they
are not so in themselves: killing a man is not
simply sinful; on the contrary, 'tis not lawful
only, but a duty, when justice and the laws of
God or man require it; but when done mali∣ciously,
from any corrupt principle, or to any
corrupted end, is murther, and the worst of
crimes.</P>
<P>PLEASURES and diversions are thus made
criminal, when a man is engaged in duty
to a full attendance upon such business as
those pleasures and diversions necessarily in∣terfere
with, and interrupt; those pleasures,
tho' innocent in themselves, become a fault in
him, because his legal avocations demand his
attendance in another place. Thus those plea∣sures
may be lawful to another man, which
are not so to him, because another man has
not the same obligation to a calling, the same
necessity to apply to it, the same cry of a fa∣mily,
whose bread may depend upon his dili∣gence,
as a tradesman has.</P>
<P><HI>SOLOMON,</HI> the royal patron of industry,
tells us, <HI>He that is a lover of pleasure, shall
be a poor man;</HI> I must not doubt but <HI>Solomon</HI>
is to be understood of <HI>tradesmen</HI> and <HI>working
men,</HI> such as I am writing of, whose time and
application is due to their business, and who in
<PB N="120" REF="137"/>
persuit of their <HI>pleasures,</HI> are sure to neglect
their shops, or employments, and I therefore
render the words thus, to the present purpose,
<HI>The tradesman that is a lover of pleasure, shall
be a poor man.</HI> I hope I do not wrest the
scripture in my interpretation of it, I am sure
it agrees with the whole <HI>tenor</HI> of the wiseman's
other discourses.</P>
<P>WHEN I see young shop-keepers keep
horses ride a hunting, learn dog-language, and
keep the sportsmens brogue upon their tongues,
I will not say I read their destiny, for I am no
<HI>fortune-teller;</HI> but I do say, I am always afraid
for them; especially when I know that either
their fortunes and beginnings are below it, or
that their trades are such as in a particular man∣ner
require their constant attendance; as to see
a barber abroad on a <HI>Saturday,</HI> a corn-factor
abroad on a <HI>Wednesday</HI> and <HI>Friday,</HI> or a <HI>Black∣well-hall</HI>
man on a <HI>Thursday,</HI> you may as well
say a country shop-keeper should go a hunting
on a market-day, or go a feasting at the fair-day
of the town where he lives; and yet riding and
hunting are otherwise lawful diversions, and in
their kind very good for exercise and health.</P>
<P>I am not for making a galley-slave of a shop-keeper,
and have him chain'd down to the oar;
but if he be a wise, a prudent and a diligent
trradesman, he will allow himself as few excur∣sions
as possible.</P>
<P>BUSINESS neglected is business lost; 'tis true,
there are some businesses which require less at∣tendance
than others, and give a man less occa∣sion
of application; but in general, that <HI>trades∣man</HI>
<PB N="121" REF="138"/>
who can satisfy himself to be absent from
his business, must not expert success; if he is
above the character of a diligent tradesman, he
must then be above the business too, and should
leave it to somebody that having more need of
it will think it worth his while to mind it bet∣ter.</P>
<P>NOR indeed is it possible a tradesman should
be master of any of the qualifications which I
have set down to denominate him <HI>complete,</HI> if
he neglects his shop and his time, following his
pleasures and diversions.</P>
<P>I'LL allow that the man is not vicious and
wicked, that he is not addicted to drunkenness,
to women, to gaming, or any such things as
those, for those are not woundings, but mur∣ther,
downright killing; a man may wound
and hurt himself sometimes, in the rage of an
ungovern'd passion, or in a frenzy or fever, and
intend no more; but if he shoots himself thro'
the head, or hangs himself, we are sure then he
intended to kill and destroy himself, and he dies
inevitably.</P>
<P>For a tradesman to follow his pleasures,
which indeed is generally attended with a slight∣ing
his business, leaving his shop to servants or
others, 'tis evident to me that he is indifferent
whether it thrives or no, and above all, 'tis
evident, that his heart is not in his business;
that he does not delight in it, or look on it
with pleasure. To a complete tradesman there
is no pleasure equal to that of being in his busi∣ness,
no delight equal to that of seeing himself
thrive, to see trade flow in upon him, and
<PB N="122" REF="139"/>
to be satisfied that he goes on prosperously: He
will never thrive, that cares not whether he
thrives or no: As trade is the chief employment
of his life, and is therefore called, by way of
eminence, <HI>his business;</HI> so it should be made
the chief delight of his life: The tradesman that
does not love his business, will never give it
due attendance.</P>
<P>PLEASURE is a bait to the mind, and the mind
will attract the body; where the heart is, the
object shall always have the body's company.
The great objection I meet with from young
tradesmen against this argument, is, they fol∣low
no unlawful pleasures; they do not spend
their time in taverns, and drinking to excess;
they do not spend their money in gaming, and
so stock-starve their business, and rob the shop
to supply the extravagant losss of play; or they
do not spend their hours in ill company, de∣baucheries
and whoring; all they do, is a little
innocent diversion in riding abroad now and
then for the air, and for their health, and to ease
their thoughts of the throneg of other affairs
which are heavy upon them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THESE, I say, are the excuses of young tradesmen,
and indeed they are young excuses; and I
may say truly, have nothing in them. It is
perhaps true, or I may grant it so for the pre∣sent
purpose, that the pleasure the tradesman
takes is, as he says, not unlawful, and that he
follows only a little innocent diversion; but let
me tell him, the words are ill put together,
and the diversion is rather recommended from
the word <HI>little,</HI> than from the word <HI>innocent:</HI>
<PB N="123" REF="140"/>
if it be indeed but little, it may be innocent;
but the case is quite altered by the extent of the
thing; and the innocence lies here, not in the
nature of the thing, not in the diversion or
pleasure that is taken, but in the time it takes;
for if the man spends the time in it which
should be spent in his shop or warchouse, and
his business suffers by his absence, as it must do,
if the absence is long at a time, or often prac∣tised;
the diversion so taken becomes criminal
to him, tho' the same diversion might be inno∣cent
in another.</P>
<P>THUS I have heard a young tradesman, who
lov'd his bottle, excuse himself, and say, 'tis
true, I have been at the tavern, but I was treat∣ed,
it cost me nothing. And this, he thinks,
clears him of all blame; not considering that
when he spends no money, yet he spends five
times the value of the money in time. Another
says, Why indeed I was at the tavern yesterday
all the afternoon, but I could not help it, and
I spent but sixpence. But at the same time per∣haps
it might be said he spent five pounds
worth of time, his business being neglected, his
shop unattended, his books not posted, his let∣ters
not written, and the like; for all thofe
things are works necessary to a tradesman, as
well as the attendance on his shop, and infinitely
above the pleasure of being treated at the ex∣pence
of his time. All manner of pleasures
should buckle and be subservient to business;
he that makes his pleasure be his business, will
never make his business be a pleasure: Innocent
pleasures become sinful, when they are used to
<PB N="124" REF="141"/>
excess, and cso it is here; the most innocent di∣version
becomes criminal, when it breaks in
upon that which is the due and just employ∣ment
of the man's life. Pleasures rob the
tradesman, and how then can he call them in∣nocent
diversions? they are downright thieves,
they rob his shop of his attendance, and of the
time which he ought to bestow there; they
rob his family of their due support, by the man's
neglecting that business by which they are to
be supported and maintained; and they often∣times
rob the creditors of their just debts, the
tradesman sinking by the inordinate use of those
innocent diversions, as he calls them, as well
by the expence attending them, as the loss of
his time, and neglect of his business, by which
he is at last reduced to the necessity of shut∣ing
up shop in earnest, which was indeed as good as
shut before. A shop without a master,
is like the same shop on a middling holiday,
half shut up; and he that keeps it long so, need
not doubt but he may in a little time more,
shut it quite up.</P>
<P>IN short, pleasure is <HI>a thief</HI> to business; how
any man can call it innocent, let him answer
that does so; it robs him every way, as I have
said above; and if the tradesman be a christian,
and has any regard to religion and his duty, I
must tell him, that when, upon his disasters, he
shall reflect, and see that he has ruin'd himself
and his family, by following too much those
diversions and pleasures which he thought in∣nocent,
and which perhaps in themselves were
really so, he will find great cause to repent of
<PB N="125" REF="142"/>
that which he insisted on as innocent; he will
find himself lost, by doing lawful things, and that
he made those innocent things sinful, and those
lawful things unlawful to him. Thus, as they
robb'd his family and creditors before of their just
debts, (for maintenance is a tradesman's just debt to
his family, and a wife and children are as much
a tradesman's real creditors, as those who trusted
him with their goods;) I say, as his innocent plea∣sures
robb'd his family and creditors before, they
will rob him now of his peace, and of all that
calm of soul which an honest, industrious, tho' un∣fortunate
tradesman meets with under his disasters.</P>
<P>I am ask'd here, perhaps, how much pleasure
an honest-meaning tradesman may be allow'd
to take? for it cannot be suppos'd I should in∣sist
that all pleasure is forbidden him, that he
must have no diversion, no spare hours, no in∣tervals
from hurry and fatigue; that would be
to pin him down to the very floor of his shop,
as <HI>John Sheppard</HI> was lock'd down to the floor
of his prison.</P>
<P>THE answer to this question every prudent
tradesman may make for himself; if his plea∣sure
is in his shop, and in his business, there is
no danger of him; but if he has an itch after
exotick diversions, I mean such as are foreign
to his shop, and to his business, and which I
therefore call <HI>exotick,</HI> let him honestly and
fairly state the case between his shop and his di∣versions,
and judge impartially for himself; so
much pleasure, and no more, may be inno∣cently
taken, as does not interfere with, or do
the least damage to his business, by taking him
away fiom it.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="143"/>
EVERY moment that his trade wants him in
his shop, or ware-house, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 'tis his duty to be
there; 'tis not enough to say, I believe I shall
not be wanted; or, I believe I shall suffer no
loss by my absence; he must come to a point,
and not deceive himself, if he does, the cheat
is all his own: if he will not judge sincerely at
first, he will reproach himself sincerely at last;
for there is no fraud against his own reflections,
a man is very rarely an hypocrite to himself.</P>
<P>THE rule may be, in a few words thus:
Those pleasures or diversions, and those only,
can be innocent, which the man may or does
use, or allow himself to use, without hindrance
of, or injury to, his busisness and reputation.</P>
<P>LET the diversions or plea:sures in question
be what they will, and how innocent soever
they are in themselves, they are not so to him;
because they interrupt or interfere with his bu∣siness,
which is his immediate duty. I have
mention'd the circumstance which touches this
part too, namely, that there may be a time
when even the needful duties of religion may
become faults, and unseasonable, when another
more needful attendance calls for us to apply
to it; much more then those things which are
only barely lawful. There is a visible difference
between the things which we may do, and
the things which we must do. pleasures at cer∣tain
seasons are allow'd, and we may give our
selves some loose to them; but business, I mean,
to the man of business, is that needful thing, of
which it is not to be said it <HI>may,</HI> but it <HI>must</HI> be
done.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="144"/>
AGAIN, those pleasures which may not only
be lawful in themselves, but which may be law∣ful
to other men, yet are criminal and unlaw∣ful
to him. To gentlemen of fortunes and e∣states,
who being born to large possessions, and
have no avocations of this kind, 'tis certainly
lawful to spend their spare hours on horseback,
with their hounds or hawks, pursuing their
game; or on foot, with their gun and their
net, and their dogs to kill the hares or birds? <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
all which we call sport. These are the men
that can, with a particular satissfaction, when
they come home, say they have only taken an
innocent diversion; and yet even in these, there
are not wanting some excesses, which take away
the innocence of them, and consequently the
satisfaction in their reflection; and therefore it
was, I said it was lawful to them to spend their
<HI>spare hours:</HI> by which I am to be understood,
those hours which are not due to more solemn
and weighty occasions, such as the duties of re∣ligion,
in particular. But as this is not my
present subject, I proceed; for I am not talking
to gentlemen now, but to tradesmen.</P>
<P>THE prudent tradesman will in time consider
what he ought, or ought not to do, in his own
particular case, as to his pleasures; not what
another man may or may not do: In short,
nothing of pleasure or diversion can be inno∣cent
to him, whatever it may be to another,
if it injures his business, if it takes either his
time, or his mind, or his delight, or his at∣tendance,
from his business; nor can all the
little excuses, of its being for his health, and
<PB N="128" REF="145"/>
for the needful unbending the bow of the
mind, from the constant application of business;
for all these must stoop to the great article of
his shop and business; tho' I might add, that the
bare taking the air for health, and for a recess
to the mind, is not the thing I am talking of;
'tis the taking an immoderate liberty, and spend∣ing
an Immoderate length of time, and that at
unseasonable and improper hours, so as to make
his pleasures and diversions be prejudicial to his
business: this is the evil I object to, and this is too
much the ruin of the tradesmen of this age;
and thus any man who calmly reads these pa∣pers
will see I ought to be understood.</P>
<P>NOR do I confine this discourse to the inno∣cent
diversions of a horse and riding abroad to
take the air; things which, as above;, are made
hurtful and unlawful to him, only as they are
hindrances to his business, and are more or less
so, as they rob his shop or warehouse, or busi∣ness,
of his attendance and time, and cause him
to draw his affections off from his calling.</P>
<P>BUT we see other and new pleasures daily
crowding in upon the tradesman, and some
which no age before this have been in danger
of; I mean, not to such an excess as is now the
case, and consequently there were fewer trades∣men
drawn Into the practice.</P>
<P>THE present age is a time of gallantry and
gaiety; nothing of the present pride and vanity
was known, or but very little of it, in former
times: the baits which are every where laid
for the corruption of youth, and for the ruin
of their fortunes, were never so many and so
mischievous as they are now.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="146"/>
WE scarce now see a tradesman's apprentice
come to his fifth year, but he gets a long wig
and a sword, and a set of companions suitable
and this wig and sword being left at proper and
convenient places are put on at night after the
shop is shut, or when they can make a slip out
to go a raking in, and when they never fail of
company ready to lead them into all manner of
wickedness and debauchery; and from this
cause it is principally, that so many apprentices
are ruin'd, and run away from their masters be∣fore
they come out of their times: more I am
persuaded now, than ever were to be found
before.</P>
<P>NOR, as I said before, will I charge the de∣vil
with having any hand in the ruin of these
young fellows; indeed lie needs not trouble
himself about them; they are his own by ear∣ly
choice; they anticipate temptation, and are as
forward as the devil can desire them to be.
These may be truly said to be drawn aside of
their own lusts, and enticed; they need no
tempter.</P>
<P>BUT of these I may also say, they seldom
trouble the tradesmens class; they get ruin'd
early, and finish the tradesman before they be∣gin;
so my discourse is not at present directed
much to them; indeed they are past advice
before they come in my way.</P>
<P>INDEED I knew one of these sort of gentle∣men-apprentices
make an attempt to begin, and
set up his trade: he was a dealer in what they
call <HI>Crooked-lane</HI> wares: he got about 300 <HI>l.</HI>
from his father, an honest plain countryman, to
<PB N="130" REF="147"/>
set him up, and his said honest father exerted
himself to the utmost to send him up so much
money.</P>
<P>WHEN He had gotten the money, he took a
shop near the place where he had served his
time, and entring upon the shop, he had it
painted, and fitted up, and some goods he bought
in order to furnish it; but before that, he was
obliged to pay about 70 <HI>l.</HI> of the money to li∣ttle
debts which he had contracted in his appren∣ticeship
at two or three ale-houses for drink and
eatables, treats and junkettings; and at the
barber's for long perukes, at the semstresses for
fine holland-shirts, turn-overs, white gloves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
to make a beau of him, and at several other
places.</P>
<P>WHEN he came to dip into this, and found that it
wanted still 30 or 40 <HI>l.</HI> to equip him for the com∣pany
which he had learn'd to keep, he took
care to do this first; and being delighted with
his new dress, and how like a gentleman he
look'd, he was resolv'd, before he open'd shop,
to take his swing a little in the town; so away
he went with two of his neighbour's apprentices
to the play-house, thence to the tavern, not far
from his dwelling, and there they fell to cards,
and sat up all night, and thus they spent about
a fortnight; the rest just creeping into their ma∣ster's
houses, by the connivance of their fellow-servants,
and he getting a bed in the tavern,
where what he spent to be sure made them wil∣ling
enough to oblige him, that is to say, to
encourage him to ruin himself.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="148"/>
THEY then chang'd their course indeed, and
went to the ball, and that necessarily kept them
but the most part of the night, always having
their supper dress'd at the tavern at their return;
and thus, in a few words, he went on 'till he
made way thro' all the remaining money he had
left, and was obliged to call his creditors toge∣ther,
and break before he so much as open'd
his shop; I say, his creditors, for great part of
the goods which he had furnish'd his shop with
were unpaid for; perhaps some few might be
bought with ready money.</P>
<P>THIS man indeed is the only tradesman that
ever I met with, that set up and broke before
his shop was open; others I have indeed known
make very quick work of it.</P>
<P>BUT this part rather belongs to another
head. I am at present not talking of madmen,
as I hope indeed I am not writing to madmen,
but I am talking of tradesmen undone by law∣ful
things, by what they call innocent and harm∣less
things; such as riding abroad, or walking a∣broad
to take the air, and to divert themselves,
dogs, gun, country-sport, and city-recreation;
these things are certainly lawful, and in them∣selves
very innocent; nay, they may be needful
for health, and to give some relaxation to the
mind hurried with too much business; but the
needfulness of them is so much made an excuse,
and the excess of them is so injurious to the
tradesman's business and to his time, which
should be set apart for his shop and his trade,
that there are not a few tradesmen thus lawfully
ruin'd, as I may call it; in a word, lawful or
<PB N="132" REF="149"/>
unlawful, their shop is neglected, their business goes
behind hand, and 'tis all one to the subject of
breaking, and to die creditor, whether the man
was undone by being a knave, of by being a fool;
'tis all one, whether he lost his trade by scanda∣lous
immoral negligence, or by sober or religi∣ous
negligence.</P>
<P>IN a word, business languishes, while the
tradesman is absent, and neglects it, be it for his
health or for his pleasure, be it in good com∣pany
or in bad, be it from a good or an ill de∣sign;
and if the business languishes, the trades∣man
will not be long before he languishes too;
for nothing can support the tradesman but his
supporting his trade by a due attendance and ap∣plication.</P>

another step to a Tradesman's disaster.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>ITHERTO I have written to you
of tradesmen ruin'd by lawful and in∣nocent
diversions; and indeed these
are some of the most dangerous pits
for a tradesman to fall into, because men are
so apt to be insensible of the danger; a ship
may as well be lost in a calm smooth sea, and
an easy fair gale of wind, as in a storm, if
they have no pilot, or the pilot be ignorant or
unwary; and disasters of that nature happen as
frequently as any others, and are as fatal; when
rocks are apparent, and the pilot bold and wil∣ful
runs directly upon, them, without fear or
wit, we know the fate of the ship, it must pe∣rish,
and all that are in it will inevitably be
lost; but in a smooth sea, a bold shoar, an easy
gale, the unseen rocks or shoals are the only
dangers, and nothing can hazard them, but the
skilfulness of the pilot: and thus it is in trade;
open debaucheries and extravagances, and a pro∣fusion
of expence, as well as a general contempt
of business, these are open and current roads
to a tradesman's destruction; but a silent going
<PB N="134" REF="151"/>
on, in persuit of innocent pleasures, a smooth
and calm, but sure neglect of his shop, and
time, and business, will as effectually and as
surely ruin the tradesman as the other; and tho'
the means are not so scandalous, the effect is
as certain. But I proceed to the other.</P>
<P>NEXT to immoderate pleasures, the tradesman
ought to be warn'd against immoderate expence.
This is a terrible article, and more particularly
so to the tradesman, as custom has now, as it
were on purpose for their undoing, introduc'd
a general habit of, and as it were a general in∣clination
among all sorts of people to, an ex∣pensive
way of living; to which might be ad∣ded
a kind of necessity of it; for that even with
the greatest prudence and frugality a man can∣not
now support a family with the ordinary ex∣pence,
which the same family might have been
maintained with some few years ago: there is
now 1. a weight of taxes upon, almost all the
necessaries of life, bread and flesh excepted,
as coals, salt, malt, candles, soap, leather, hops,
wine, fruit, and all foreign consumptions. 2.
A load of pride upon the temper of the nation,
which in spight of taxes and the unusual dear∣ness
of every thing, yet prompts people to a pro∣fusion
in their expences.</P>
<P>THIS is not so properly called <HI>a tax</HI> upon
the tradesmen; I think rather, it may be called
<HI>a plague</HI> upon them; for there is first the dear∣ness
of every necessary thing to make living ex∣pensive;
and secondly, an unconquerable aver∣sion
to any restraint: so that the poor will be
like the rich, and the rich like the great, and
<PB N="135" REF="152"/>
the great like the greatest; and thus the world
runs on to a kind of distraction at this time;
<HI>where it will end, time must discover.</HI></P>
<P>NOW the tradesman I speak of, if he will
thrive, he must resolve to begin, as he can go
on; and if he does so, in a word he must re∣solve
to live more under restraint than ever
tradesmen of his class used to do; for every
necessary thing being, as I have said, grown
dearer than before, he must entirely omit all
the enjoyment of the unnecessaries which he
might have allow'd himself before, or perhaps
be obliged to an expence beyond the income of
his trade; and in either of these cases he has
a great hardship upon him.</P>
<P>WHEN I talk of immoderate expences, I must
be understood not yet to mean the extravagan∣ces
of wickedness and debaucheries; there are
so many sober extravagances, and so many grave
sedate ways for a tradesman's ruin, and they
are so much more dangerous than those hair∣brain'd
desperate ways of gaming and whoring,
that I think 'tis the best service I can do the
tradesman to lay before them those <HI>sunk rocks</HI>
(as the seamen call them) those secret dangers
in the first place, that they may know how to
avoid them; and as for the other common ways,
common discretion will supply them with cau∣tion
for those, and their senses will be their
protection.</P>
<P>The dangers to the tradesmen, who I am di∣recting
myself to, are from lawful things, and
such as before are call'd innocent,; for I am speak∣ing
to the sober part of tradesmen, who yet
<PB N="136" REF="153"/>
are often ruin'd and overthrown in trade; and
perhaps as many such miscarry, as of the mad
and extravagant, particularly because their num∣ber
far exceeds them. Expensive living is a kind
of slow fever; it is not so open, so threat'ning
and dangerous, as the ordinary distemper which
goes by that name, but it preys upon the spi∣rits,
and, when its degrees are encreas'd to an
height, is as fatal and as sure ro kill as the o∣ther;
'tis a secret enemy, that feeds upon the
vitals; and when it has gone its full length, and
the languishing tradesman is weakened ill his so∣lid
part, I mean his stock, then it overwhelms
him at once.</P>
<P>EXPENSIVE living feeds upon the life and blood
of the tradesman; for it eats into the two most
essential branches of his trade, namely, his cre∣dit,
and his cash; the first is its triumph, and
the last is its food: nothing goes out to cherish
the exorbitance, but the immediate money;
expences seldom go on trust, they are generally
supplied and supported urith ready money, what∣ever
are not.</P>
<P>THIS expensive way of living consists in se∣veral
things, which are all indeed in their de∣gree
ruinous to the tradesman; such as
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. EXPENSIVE house-keeping, or family ex∣travagance.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. EXPENSIVE dressing, or the extravagance
of fine cloaths.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. EXPENSIVE company, or keeping company
above himself.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. EXPENSIVE equipages, making a shew and
ostentation of figure in the world.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="154"/>
I might take them all in bulk, and say, what
has a young tradesman to do with these? and
yet where is there a tradesman now to be found,
who is not more or less guilty? it is, as I have
said, the general vice of the times; the whole
nation are more or less in the crime; what with
necessity and inclination, where is the man or
the family that lives as such families used to
live?</P>
<P>IN short, good husbandry and frugality is
quite out of fashion, and he that goes about to
set up for the practice of it, must mortify every
thing about him that has the least tincture of
frugality; 'tis the mode to live high, to spend
more than we get, to neglect trade, contemn
care and concern, and go on without forecast,
or without consideration; and in consequence
'tis the mode to go on to extremity, to break,
become bankrupt and beggars, and so going off
of the trading stage, leave it open for others to
come after us, and do the same.</P>
<P>TO begin with house-kecping. I have alrea∣dy
hinted, that every thing belonging to the fa∣mily
-subsistence bears a higher price than usual,
I may say, than ever: at the same time I can
neither undertake to prove that there is more
got by selling, or more ways to get it, I mean
to a tradesman, than there was formerly; the
consequence then must be, that the tradesmen
do not grow rich faster than formerly; at least
we may venture to say this of tradesmen and
their families, comparing them with former
times, namely, that there is not more got, and
I am satisfied there is less laid up, than was
<PB N="138" REF="155"/>
then; or if you will have it, that tradesmen get
less and spend more than they ever did, how
they should be richer than they were in those
times, is very hard to say.</P>
<P>THAT all things are dearer than formerly to
a house-keeper, needs little demonstration; the
taxes necessarily infer it from the weight of
them, and the number of the things charged;
for besides the things enumerated above, we
find all articles of foreign importation are in∣creased
by the high duties laid on them; such
as linen, <HI>especially fine linen;</HI> silk, especially
foreign wrought silk: every thing eatable,
drinkable and wearable, are made heavy to us
by high and exorbitant customs and excises, as
brandies, tobacco, sugar; deals and timber for
building; oil, wine, spice, raw silks, callicoe,
chocolate, coffee, tea; on some of these the
duties are more than doubled: and yet that
which is most observable is, that such is the
expensive humour of the times, that not a fa∣mily,
no, hardly of the meanest tradesmen, but
treat their friends with wine, or punch, or fine
ale; and have their parlours let off with the
tea-table and the chocolate-pot; treats and li∣quors
all exotick, foreign and new among tradesmen,
and terrible articles in their modern ex∣pences;
which have nothing to be said for
them, either as to the expence of them, or the
helps to health which they boast of: on the
contrary, they procure us rheumatick bodies, and
consumptive purses, and can no way pass with
me for necessaries; but being needless, they add
to the expence, by sending us to the doctors
<PB N="139" REF="156"/>
and apothecaries to cure the breaches which
they make in our health, and are themselves
the very worst sort of superfluities.</P>
<P>BUT I come back to necessaries; and e∣ven
in them, family-expences are extremely
risen; provisions are higher rated; nothing of
provisions, <HI>that I know of,</HI> except only bread,
mutton, and fish, but which are made dearer
than ever? house-rent, in almost all the cities
and towns of note in <HI>England,</HI> is excessively
and extremely dearer; and that in spite of such
innumerable buildings as we see almost every
where rais'd up, as well in the country as at
<HI>London,</HI> and the parts adjacent.</P>
<P>ADD to the rents of houses, the wages of
servants. A tradesman, be he ever so much
inclin'd to good husbandry, cannot always do
his kitchin-work himself, <HI>suppose him a batche∣lor;</HI>
or can his wife, <HI>suppose him married,</HI> and
suppose her to have brought him any portion,
be his bedfellow and his cook too: these maid-servants
then are to be consider'd, and are an
exceeding tax upon house-keepers; those who
were formerly hired at three pounds to four
pounds a year wages, now demand five, six, and
eight pounds a year; nor do they double any
thing upon us but their wages and their pride;
for instead of doing more work for their ad∣vance
of wages, <HI>they do less:</HI> and the ordinary
work of families cannot now be performed by
the same number of maids, which in short is a
tax upon the upper sort of tradesmen, and con∣tributes
very often to their disasters, by the ex∣travagant
keeping three pr four maid-servants
<PB N="140" REF="157"/>
in a house, nay, sometimes five, where two
formerly were thought sufficient. This very
extravagance is such, that talking, lately with a
man very well experienced in this matter, he
told me he had been making his calculations
on that very particular; and he found by com∣putation,
that the number of servants kept by
all sorts of people, tradesmen as well as others,
was so much encreased, that there are in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
and the towns within ten miles of it,
take it every way, above an hundred thousand
more maid-servants and footmen, at this time
in place, than used to be in the same compass
of ground thirty years ago; and that their wages
amounted to above forty shillings a head <HI>per
annum,</HI> more than the wages of the like num∣ber
of servants did amount to at the same
length of time past; the advance to the whole
body amounting to no less than two hundred
thousand pounds a year.</P>
<P>INDEED it is not easy to guess what the ex∣pence
of wages to servants amounts to in a
year, in this nation; and consequently we can∣nor
easily determine what the encrease of that
expence amounts to in <HI>England,</HI> but certainly
it must rise to many hundred thousand pounds
a year in the whole.</P>
<P>THE tradesmen bear their share of this ex∣pence,
and indeed too great a share, very or∣dinary
tradesmen in <HI>London</HI> keeping at least
two maids, and some more, and some a foot∣man
or two besides; for 'tis an ordinary thing
to see the tradesmen and shop-keepers of <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
keep footmen, as well as the gentlemen;
<PB N="141" REF="158"/>
witness the infinite number of blue liveries,
which are so common now, that they are cal∣led
<HI>the tradesmens liveries;</HI> and few gentlemen
care to give blue to their servants for that very
reason.</P>
<P>IN proportion to their servants, the tradesmen
now keep their tables; which are also advanced
in their proportion of expence to other things;
indeed the citizens and tradesmens tables are
now the emblems, not of plenty, but of luxu∣ry,
not of good house-keeping, but of profu∣sion,
and that of the highest kind of extrava∣gancies;
insomuch, that it was the opinion of
a gentleman who had been not a traveller on∣ly,
but a nice observer of such things abroad,
that there is at this time more waste of provi∣sions
in <HI>England,</HI> than in any other nation in
the world, of equal extent of ground; and that
<HI>England consumes</HI> for their whole subsistence
more flesh than half <HI>Europe</HI> besides; that the
beggars of <HI>London,</HI> and within ten miles round
it, eat more white bread than the whole king∣dom
of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>BUT this is an observation only, tho' I believe
'tis very just; I am bringing it in here only as
an example of the dreadful profusion of this
age; and how an extravagant way of expensive
living, perfectly negligent of all degrees of
frugality or good husbandry, is the reigning
vice of the people: I could enlarge upon it, and
very much to the purpose here, but I shall have
occasion to speak of it again.</P>
<P>THE tradesman, who I am speaking to by
way of direction, will not, I hope, think this
<PB N="142" REF="159"/>
the way for him to thrive, or find it for his
convenience to fall in with this common
height of living presently, in his beginning; if
he comes gradually into it after he has gotten
something considerable to lay by, <HI>I say,</HI> if he
does it then, 'tis early enough, and he may be
said to be insensibly drawn into it by the ne∣cessity
of the times; because, <HI>forsooth,</HI> 'tis a
receive'd notion, <HI>We must be like other folks:</HI> I
say, if he does fall into it then, when he will
pretend he cannot help it, 'tis better than worse;
and if he can afford it, well and good; but to
begin thus, to set up at this rate, when he first
looks into the world, I can only say this, he
that begins in such a manner, 'twill not be
difficult to guess where he will end: for a
tradesman's pride certainly <HI>precedes his destruc∣tion,</HI>
and an expensive living goes <HI>before his
fall.</HI></P>
<P>WE are speaking now to a tradesman, who,
'tis suppos'd, must live by his business; a young
man who sets up a shop, or warehouse, and
expects to get money; one that would be a
rich tradesman, rather than a poor, fine, gay
man; a grave citizen, not a peacock's feather:
for he that sets up for a <HI>Sir Fopling Flutter,</HI> in∣stead
of a <HI>compleat tradesman,</HI> is not to be
thought capable of relishing this discourse;
neither does this discourse relish him; for such
men seem to be amons; the incurables, and are
rather fit for an hospital of fools (<HI>so the French call our Bedlam</HI>) than to undertake trade, and enter upon business.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="160"/>
TRADE is not a ball, where people appear in
masque, and act a part to make sport; where
they strive to seem what they really are not,
and to think themselves best drest when they
are least known: but 'tis a plain visible scene
of honest life, shewn best in its native appear∣ance,
without disguise; supported by prudence
and frugality; and like strong, stiff, clay land, grows
fruitful only by good husbandry, culture and
manuring.</P>
<P>A tradesman drest up fine, with his long wig
and sword, may go to the ball when he pleases,
for he is already drest up in the habit; like a
piece of counterfeit money, he is brass wash'd
over with silver, and no tradesman will take
him for current; with: money in his hand, in∣deed,
he may go to the merchant's warehouse
and buy any thing, but no body will deal with
him without it: he may write upon his edg'd∣hat,
as a certain tradesman, after having been
once broke and set up again, <HI>I neither give nor
take credit:</HI> and as others set up in their shops,
<HI>No trust by retale,</HI> so he may say, <HI>No trust by
wholesale.</HI> In short, thus equip'd, he is truly a
tradesman <HI>in masquerade,</HI> and must pass for
such wherever he is known. How long it may
be before his dress and he may suit, is not hard
to guess.</P>
<P>SOME will have it that this expensive way of
living began among the tradesmen first; <HI>that is
to say,</HI> among the citizens of <HI>London;</HI> and that
their eager resolv'd persuit of that empty and
meanest kind of pride, call'd imitation, <HI>viz.</HI>
to look like the gentry, and appear above them∣selves,
<PB N="144" REF="161"/>
drew them into it. It has indeed been
a fatal custom, but it has been too long a city
vanity; if men of quality; liv'd like themselves,
men of no quality would strive to live, not like
themselves: if those had plenty, these would
have profusion; if those had enough, these
would have excess; if those had what was good,
these would have what was rare and exotick;
I mean as to season, and consequently dear.
And this is one of the ways that has worn out
so many tradesmen before their time.</P>
<P>THIS extravagance, where-e're it began, had
its first rise among those sorts of tradesmen,
who scorning the society of their shops and
customers, applyed themselves to rambling to
courts and plays; kept company above them∣selves,
and spent their hours in such company
as lives always above them; this could not but
bring great expence along with it; and that ex∣pence
would not be confined to the bare keep∣ing
such company abroad, but soon shew'd it
self in a living <HI>like them</HI> at home, whether the
tradesmen could support it or no.</P>
<P>KEEPING high company <HI>abroad,</HI> certainly
brings on visitings and high treatings <HI>at home;</HI>
and these are attended with costly furniture,
rich clothes, and dainty tables: how these things
agree with a tradesman's income, 'tis easy to
suggest; and that in short, these measures have
sent so many tradesmen to the <HI>Mint,</HI> and to
the <HI>Fleet,</HI> where I am witness to it that they
have stll carried on their expensive living till
they have come at last to starving and misery;
but have been so used to it, they could not a∣bate
<PB N="145" REF="162"/>
it, or at least not quite leave it off, though
they wanted the money to pay for it.</P>
<P>NOR is the expensive dressing a little tax
upon tradesmen, as it is now come up to an
excess not formerly known to tradesmen; and
tho' it is true that this particularly respects the
ladies, (for the tradesmens wives now claim
that title, as they do by their dress claim
the appearance,) yet to do justice to them,
and not to load the women with the reproach,
as if it was wholly theirs, it must be acknow∣ledged
the men have their share in dress, as
the times go now, tho' <HI>it is true,</HI> not so an∣tick
and gay as in former days; but do we not
see fine wigs, fine holland shirts of six to seven
shillings an ell, and perhaps lac'd also, all late∣ly
brought down to the level of the apron,
and become the common wear of tradesmen;
nay, I may say of tradesmens apprentices, and
that in such a manner as was never known in
<HI>England</HI> before.</P>
<P>IF the tradesman is thriven, and can support
this and his credit too, that makes the case dif∣fer,
tho' even then it cannot be said to be suit∣able;
but for a tradesman <HI>to begin thus,</HI> is very
imprudent, because the expence of this, as <HI>I
said before,</HI> dreins the very life-blood of his
trade, taking away his ready money only, and
making no return, but the worst of return, po∣verty
and reproach; and in case of miscarriage,
infinite scandal and offence.</P>
<P>I am loth to make any part of my writing
a satyr upon the women; nor indeed does the
extravagance either of dress or house-keeping,
<PB N="146" REF="163"/>
lie all, or always, at the door of the trades∣mens
wives; the husband is often the prompter
of it; at least he does not let his wife into the
detail of his circumstances, he does not make
her mistress of her own condition; but either
flatters her with notions of his wealth, his pro∣fits,
and his flourishing circumstances, and so the
innocent woman spends high and lives great,
believing that she is in a condition to afford it,
and that her husband approves of it; at least he
does not offer to retrench or restrain her, but
lets her go on, and indeed goes on with her,
to the ruin of both.</P>
<P>I cannot but mention one thing here (tho' I
purpose to give you one discourse on that sub∣ject
by it self,) namely, the great and indispen∣sible
obligation there is upon a tradesman al∣ways
to acquaint his wife with the truth of
his circumstances, and not to let her run on in
ignorance, till she falls with him down the pre∣cipice
of an unavoidable ruin; a thing no pru∣dent
woman would do, and therefore will ne∣ver
take amiss a husband's plainness in that par∣ticular
case. But I reserve this to another place,
because I am rather directing my discourse at
this time to the tradesman at his beginning,
and, as it may be supposed, unmarried.</P>
<P>NEXT to the expensive dressing, I place the
expensive keeping company, as one thing fatal
to a tradesman, and which, if he would be a
complete tradesman, he should avoid with the
utmost diligence. 'Tis an agreeable thing to be
seen in good company; for a man to see himself
courted and valued, and his company desired by
<PB N="147" REF="164"/>
men of fashion and distinction, is very pleasing
to any young tradesman, and it is really a snare
which a young tradesman; if he be a man of
sense, can very hardly resist: There is in it self
indeed nothing that can be objected against, or
is not very agreeable to the nature of man, and
that not to his vicious part merely, but even to
his best faculties; for who would not value
himself upon being, <HI>as above,</HI> rendred accepta∣ble
to men both in station and figure above
themselves? and it is really a piece of excellent
advice, which a learned man gave to his son,
always to keep company with men above him∣self,
not with men below himself.</P>
<P>BUT take me now to be talking, as I really
am, not to the man merely, but to his circum∣stances;
if he were a man of fortune, and had
the view of great things before him, it would
hold good; but if he is a young tradesman,
such as I am now speaking of, who is newly
entred into business, and must depend upon his
said business for his subsistence and support,
and hopes to raise himself by it; I say, if I am
talking to such an one, I must say to him, that
keeping company as above, with men superior
to himself in knowledge, in figure, and estate,
is not his business; for <HI>first,</HI> as such conversa∣tion
must necessarily take up a great, deal of
his time, so it ordinarily must occasion a great
expence of money, and both destructive of his
prosperity; nay, sometimes the first may be as
fatal to him as the last; and 'tis oftentimes true
in that sense, of trade, that while by keeping
company he is drawn out of his business, his
<PB N="148" REF="165"/>
absence from his shop or warehouse is the most
fatal to him; and while he spends one crown
in the tavern, he spends forty crowns worth of
his time; and with this difference too, which ren∣ders
it the worse to the tradesman, <HI>viz.</HI> that the
money may be recovered, and gotten up again,
but the time cannot. <HI>For example,</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. PERHAPS in that very juncture a person
comes to his warehouse, suuppose the tradesman
to be a warehousekeeper, who trades by com∣mission,
and this person, being a clothier in the
country, comes to offer him his business, the
commission of which might have been worth
to him 30 to 40 or 50 <HI>l. per annum,</HI> but finding
him abroad, or rather, not finding him at home
and in his business, goes to another, and fixes
with him at once. I once knew a dealer lose
such an occasion as this for an afternoon's plea∣sure,
he being gone a fishing into <HI>Hackney∣marsh.</HI>
This loss can never be restor'd; this
expence of time was a fatal expence of money;
and no tradesmen will deny but they find ma∣ny
such things as this happen in the course of
trade, either to themselves, or others.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. ANOTHER tradesman is invited to dinner <HI>by
his great friend;</HI> for I am now speaking chiefly
upon the subject of keeping high company, and
what the tradesman sometimes suffers by it; it
is true, that there he finds a most noble enter∣tainment,
the person of quality, and that pro∣fesses
a friendship for him, treats him with infi∣nite
respect, is fond of him, makes him wel∣come
as a prince; for I am speaking of the
acquaintance as really valuable and good in it
<PB N="149" REF="166"/>
self; but then, see it in its consequences; the
tradesman on this occasion <HI>misses his Change;</HI>
that is, omits going to the <HI>Exchange</HI> for that
one day only, and not being found there, a
merchant with whom he was in treaty for a large
parcel of foreign goods, which would have
been to his advantage to have bought, sells
them to another <HI>more diligent</HI> man in the same
way; and when he comes home, he finds to
his great mortification, that he has lost a bar∣gain
that would have been worth an 100 <HI>l.</HI> buy∣ing;
and now being in want of the goods, he
is forced to entreat his neighbour who bought
them to part with some of them at a conside∣rable
advance of price, and esteem it a favour
too. Who now paid dearest for the visit to a
person of figure? the gentleman, who perhaps
spent twenty shillings extraordinary to give him
a handsome dinner, or the tradesman who lost
a bargain worth a hundred pound buying to go
to eat it?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. ANOTHER tradesman goes to <HI>Change</HI> in
the ordinary course of his business, intending to
speak with some of the merchants his customers,
as is usual, and get orders for goods, or per∣haps
an appointment to come to his warehouse
to buy; but a snare of the like kind falls in
his way, and a couple of friends, who perhaps
have little or no business, <HI>at least with him,</HI>
lay hold of him, and they agree to go off
<HI>Change</HI> to the tavern together. By complying
with this invitation, he omits speaking to some
of those merchants, as above, who though he
knew nothing of their minds, yet it had been
<PB N="150" REF="167"/>
his business to have shewn himself to them, and
have put himself in the way of their call; but
omitting this, he goes and drinks a bottle of
wine, <HI>as above,</HI> and tho' he stays but an hour,
or, as we say, but a little while, yet unluckily
in that interim, the merchant, not seeing him
on the <HI>Exchange,</HI> calls at his warehouse as he
goes from the <HI>Exchange,</HI> but not finding him
there neither, he goes to another warehouse,
and gives his orders to the value of three or
four hundred pounds, to a more diligent neigh∣bour
of the same business; by which he (the
warehouse-keeper) not only loses the profit of
selling that parcel, or serving that order, but the
merchant is shew'd the way to his neigh∣bour's
warehouse, who being more diligent than
himself, fails not to cultivate his interest, ob∣liges
him with selling low, even to little or no
gain, for the first parcel; and so the unhappy
tradesman loses not his selling that parcel on∣ly,
but loses the very customer, which was as
it were his peculiar property before.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>ALL these things, and many more such, are
the consequences of a tradesman's absence from
his business; and I therefore say, the expence
of time on such light occasions as these, is one
of the worst sorts of extravagance, and the most
fatal to the tradesman, because really he knows
not what he loses.</P>
<P>ABOVE all things, the tradesman should take
care not to be absent in the season of business,
as I have mention'd above; for the warehouse-keeper
to be absent from <HI>Change,</HI> which is his
market, or from his warehouse, at the times
<PB N="151" REF="168"/>
when the merchants generally go about to buy,
he had better be absent all the rest of the day.</P>
<P>I know nothing is more frequent, than for
the tradesman, when company invites, or an
excursion from business presses, to say, Well,
come, I have nothing to do, here's no business
to hinder, there's nothing neglected, I have no
letters to write, and the like; and away he
goes to take the air for the afternoon, or to
sit and enjoy himself with a friend, all of them
things innocent and lawful in themselves; but
here is the crisis of a tradesman's prosperity, in
that very moment business presents, a valuable
customer comes to buy, an unexpected bargain
offers to be sold, another calls to pay money,
<HI>and the like;</HI> nay, I would almost say, but that
I am loth to concern the <HI>devil</HI> in more evils
than he is guilty of, that <HI>the devil</HI> frequently
draws a man out of his business when some∣thing
extraordinary, is just at hand for his ad∣vantage.</P>
<P>BUT not, <HI>as I have said,</HI> to charge the <HI>de∣vil</HI>
with what he is not guilty of, the trades∣man
is generally his own tempter; his head
runs off from his business by a secret indolence;
company, and the pleasure of being well receiv'd
among gentlemen, is a cursed snare to a young
tradesman, and carries him away from his bu∣siness,
for the mere vanity of being caress'd
and complimented by men who mean no
ill, and perhaps know not the mischief they
do to the man they shew respect to; and this
the young tradesman cannot resist, and that is
in time his undoing.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="169"/>
THE tradesman's pleasure should be in his
business, his companions should be his books,
and if he has a family, <HI>he makes his excursions
up stairs, and no farther;</HI> when he is there, a
bell or a call brings him down; and while he is
in his parlour, his shop or his warehouse never
misses him; his customers never go away un∣serv'd,
his letters never come in and are unan∣swer'd.
None of my cautions aim at restrain∣ing
a tradesman from diverting himself, as we
call it, with his fire-side, or keeping company
with his wife and children: there are so few
tradesmen ruin themselves that way, and so few
ill consequences happen upon an uxorious temper,
that I will not so much as rank it with
the rest; nor can it be, justly call'd one of the
occasions of a tradesman's disasters; on the con∣trary,
'tis too often that the want of a due com∣placency
there, the want of taking delight there,
estranges the man from not his parlour on∣ly,
but his warehouse and shop, and every part
of business, that ought to engross both his mind
and his time. That tradesman who does not
delight in his family, will never long delight in
his business; for as one great end of an honest
tradesman's diligence is the support of his fa∣mily,
and the providing for the comfortable sub∣sistence
of his wife and children; so the very
sight of, and above all, his tender and affec∣tionate
care for his wife and children, is the
spur of his diligence; this is it puts an edge
upon his mind, and makes him hunt the world
for buisness, as hounds hunt the woods for their
game: when he is dispirited, or discouraged
<PB N="153" REF="170"/>
by crosses and disappointments, and ready to lie
down and despair, the very sight of his family
rouzes him again, and he flies to his business
with a new vigour; I must follow my business,
says he, or we must all starve, my poor child∣ren
must perish; in a word, he that is not ani∣mated
to diligence by the very sight and thought
of his wife and children being brought to mi∣sery
and distress, is a kind of a deaf adder that
no music will charm, or a <HI>Turkish</HI> mute that no
pity can move: in a word, he is a creature not
to be call'd human, a wretch harden'd against all
the passions and affections that nature has fur∣nish'd
to other animals; and as there is no rhe∣torick
of use to such a kind of man as that, so
I am not talking to such an one, he must go
among the incurables; for where nature cannot
work, what can argument assist?</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T was a prudent provision which our an∣cestors
made in the indentures of trades∣mens
apprentices, that they should not
contract matrimony during their apprenticeship;
<PB N="154" REF="171"/>
and they bound it with a penalty that was then
thought sufficient, however custom has taken off
the edge of it since; <HI>viz.</HI> that they who did
thus contract matrimony should forfeit their in∣dentures,
that is to say, should lose the benefit
of their whole service, and not be made free.</P>
<P>DOUBTLESS our forefathers were better ac∣quainted
with the advantages of frugality than
we are, and saw farther into the desperate con∣sequences
of expensive living in the beginning
of a tradesman's setting out into the world than
we do; at least 'tis evident they studied more,
and practised more of the prudential part in
those cases, than we do.</P>
<P>HENCE we find them very careful to bind
their youth under the strongest obligations they
could, to temperance, modesty, and good hus∣bandry,
as the grand foundations of their pro∣sperity
in trade, and to prescribe to them such
rules and methods of frugality and good hus∣bandry,
as they thought would best conduce to
their prosperity.</P>
<P>AMONG these rules this was one of the chief,
<HI>viz. that they should not wed before they had
sped:</HI> it is an old homely rule, and coursly ex∣press'd,
but the meaning is evident, that a young
beginner should never marry too soon; while
he was a servant, he was bound from it as a∣bove,
and when he had his liberty, he was per∣suaded
against it by all the arguments which
indeed ought to prevail with a considering man,
namely, the cxpences that a family necessarily
would bring with it, and the care he ought to
take to be able to support the expence before
he brought it upon himself.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="172"/>
On this account it is, I say, our ancestors took
more care of their youth than we now do, at∣least,
I think, they studied well the best methods
of thriving and were better acquainted with
the steps by which a young tradesman ought to
be introduc'd into the world than we are, and
of the difficulties which those people would ne∣cessarily
involve themselves in, who despising;
those rules and methods of frugality, involv'd
themselves in the expence of a family before
they were in a way of gaining sufficient to sup∣port
it.</P>
<P>A married apprentice will always make a re∣penting
tradesman, and those stolen matches,
<HI>a very few excepted,</HI> are generally attended with
infinite broils and troubles, difficulties, and cross
events to carry them on at first by way of in∣triegue,
to conceal them afterward under fear
of superiours, to manage after that to keep off
scandal, and preserve the character as well of
the wise as of the husband; and all this neces∣sarily
attended with a heavy expence, even be∣fore
the young man is out of his time; before
he has set a foot forward, or gotten a shilling
in the world; so that all this expence is out of
his original stock, even before he gets it, and is
a sad draw-back upon him when it comes.</P>
<P>Nay, this unhappy and dirty part is often at∣tended
with worse consequences still; for this
expence coming upon him while he is but a ser∣vant,
and While his portion, <HI>or whatever it is
to be called,</HI> is not yet come into his hand, he
is driven to terrible exigences to supply this ex∣pence;
If his circumstances are mean, and his
<PB N="156" REF="173"/>
trade mean, he is frequently driven to wrong
his master, and rob his shop, or his TILL for
money, if he can come at it; and this, as it
begins in madness, generally ends in destructi∣on;
for often he is discover'd, expos'd, and per∣haps
punish'd, and so the man is undone be∣fore
he begins: if his circumstances are good,
and he has friends that are able, and expecta∣tions
that are considerable, then his expence is
still the greater; and ways and means are found
out, or at least look'd for to supply the expence,
and conceal the fact, that his friends may not
know of it, 'till he has gotten the blessing he
expects into his hands, and is put in a way to
stand upon his own legs; and then it comes
out with a great many grieving aggravations to
a parent to find himself trick'd and defeated in
the expectations of his son's marrying handsomly,
and to his advantage; instead of which he is
obliged, to receive a dishclout for a daughter in
law, and see his family propagated by a race of
beggars, and yet perhaps as haughty, as insolent,
and as expensive, as if she had bless'd the family
with a lady of fortune, and brought a fund
with her to have supported the charge of her
posterity.</P>
<P>WHEN this happens, the poor young man's
case is really deplorable: before he is out of his
time, and while he nourishes his new spouse in
the dark, he is obliged to borrow of friends, <HI>if
he has any,</HI> on pretence his father does not
make him a sufficient allowance, or he entrench∣es
upon his master's cash, which perhaps, <HI>he
being the eldest apprentice,</HI> is in his hands; and
<PB N="157" REF="174"/>
this he does, depending that when he is out of his time,
and his father gives him wherewith to
set up, he will make good the deficiency, and
all this happens accordingly; so that his repu∣tation
as to his master is preserv'd, and he comes
off clear as to dishonesty in his trust.</P>
<P>BUT what a sad chasm does it make in his
fortune! I knew a certain young tradesman,
whose father knowing nothing of his son's mea∣sures,
gave him 2000 <HI>l.</HI> to set up with, strain∣ing
himself to the utmost for the well intro∣ducing
his son into the world; but who, when
he came to set up, having near a year before
married the servant-maid of the house, and kept
her privately at a great expence, had above six
hundred pounds of his stock already wasted and
sunk, before he began, for himself; the conse∣quence
of which was, that going in partner with
another young man, who had likewise
2000 <HI>l.</HI> to begin with, he was, instead of a half
of the profits, obliged to make a private article
to accept of a third of the trade; and the beg∣gar
wife proving more expensive by far than the
partner's wife (who married afterwards, and dou∣bled
his fortune) the first young man was obliged
to quit the trade, and with his remaining stock
set up by himself; in which case his expences
continuing, and his stock being insufficient, he
sunk gradually, and then broke, and died poor:
in a word, he broke the heart of his father,
wasted what he had, and could never recover it,
and at last it broke his own heart too.</P>
<P>BUT I shall bring it a little farther. Suppose
the youth not to act so grosly neither; not to
<PB N="158" REF="175"/>
marry in his apprenticeship, not to be forced to
keep a wife in the dark, and eat the bread he
never got; but suppose him to be entred upon
the world, that he has set up, open'd shop, or
fitted up his warehouse, and he is ready to trade;
the next thing in the ordinary course of the
world at this time is <HI>a wise;</HI> nay, I have met
with some parents, who have been indiscreet
enough themselves to prompt their sons to mar∣ry
as soon as they are set up; and the reason
they give for it is, the wickedness of the age,
that youth are drawn in a hundred ways to ru∣inous
matches or debaucheries, and are so easily
ruin'd by the meer looseness of their circum∣stances,
that 'tis needful to marry them to
keep them at home, and to preserve them dili∣gent,
and bind them close to their business.</P>
<P>THIS, be it just or not, is a bad cure of an
ill disease; it is ruining the young man to make
him sober, and making him a slave for life to
make him diligent; be it that the wife he shall
marry is a sober, frugal, housewifely woman,
and that nothing is to be laid to her charge but
the meer necessary addition of a family expence,
and that with the utmost moderation; yet at
the best he cripples his fortune, <HI>stock-starves his
business,</HI> and brings a great expence upon him∣self
at first, before by his success in trade he had
laid up stock enough to support the charge.</P>
<P>FIRST, it is reasonable to suppose that that at his
beginning in the world he cannot expect to get
so good a portion with a wife, as he might af∣ter
he had been set up a few years, and by his
diligence and frugality join'd to a small expence
<PB N="159" REF="176"/>
in house-keeping had increas'd both his stock in
trade, and the trade itself; then he would be
able ro look forward boldly, and would have
some pretence for insisting on a fortune, when
he could make out his improvements in trade,
and shew, that he was both able to maintain a
wife, and able to live without her: when a
young tradesman in <HI>Holland</HI> or <HI>Germany</HI> goes
a courting, I am told, the first question the
young woman asks of him, or perhaps her friends
for her is, <HI>Are you able to pay the charges?</HI>
that is to say in <HI>English,</HI> Are you able to keep
a wife when you have got her? the question is
a little <HI>Gothick</HI> indeed, and would be but a
kind of gross way of receiving a lover here, ac∣cording
to our <HI>English</HI> good breeding; but
there is a great deal of reason in the enquiry,
<HI>that must he confess'd;</HI> and he that is not able
to <HI>pay the charges,</HI> should never begin the jour∣ney;
for be the wife what she will, the very state
of life, that naturally attends the marrying a
woman, brings with it an expence so very con∣siderable,
that a tradesman ought, to consider
very well of it before he engages.</P>
<P>BUT it is to be observ'd too, that abundance
of young tradesmen, especially in <HI>England,</HI>
not only marry early, but by the so marrying
they are obliged to take up with much less for∣tunes
in their haste, than when they allow them∣selves
longer time of consideration; as it stands
now, generally speaking, the wife and the shop
make their first shew together; but how
few of these early marriages succeed? how hard
such a tradesman finds it to stand, and support
<PB N="160" REF="177"/>
the weight that attends it, I appeal to the expe∣rience
of those, who having taken this wrong
step, and being with difficulty got over it, are
yet good judges of that particular circumstance
in others that come after them.</P>
<P>I know 'tis a common cry that is rais'd a∣gainst
the woman, when her husband miscarries,
namely, that 'tis the wife has ruin'd him: it is
true, in some particular cases it may be so, but
in general 'tis wrong placed; they may say mar∣rying
has ruin'd the man, when they cannot
say his wife has done it; for the woman was
not in fault, but her husband.</P>
<P>WHEN a tradesman marries, there are neces∣sary
consequences, I mean of expences, which
the wife ought not be charg'd with, and cannot
be made accountable for; such as, <HI>first,</HI> furnish∣ing
the house; and let this be done with the
utmost plainness, so as to be decent, yet it must
be done; and this calls for ready money, and
that ready money by so much diminishes his stock
in trade; nor is the wife at all to be charg'd in
this case, unless she either put him to more
charge than was needful, or shew'd herself dis∣satisfy'd
with things needful, and requir'd extra∣vagant
gaiety and expence: <HI>secondly, servants;</HI>
if the man was frugal before, it may be he shift∣ed
with a shop, and a servant in it, an appren∣tice,
or journeyman, or perhaps without one at
first, and a lodging for himself, where he kept
no other servant, and so his expences went on
small and easy; or, if he was obliged to take
a house because of his business and the situation
of his shop, he then either let part of the house
<PB N="161" REF="178"/>
out to lodgers, keeping himself a chamber in it
or at the worst lest it unfurnish'd, and without
any one but a maid-servant to dress his victuals,
and keep the house clean; and thus he goes on
when a batchelor, with a middling expence at
most.</P>
<P>BUT when he brings home a wife, besides the
furnishing his house, he must have a formal
house-keeping, even, at the very first; and,
as children come on, more servants, that is, maids or
nurses, that are as necessary as the bread he eats;
especially if he multiplies apace, as he ought
to suppose he may; in this case let the wife be
frugal and managing, let her be unexceptionable
in her expence, yet the man finds his charge
mount high, and perhaps too high for his get∣tings,
notwithstanding the additional stock ob∣tain'd
by her portion; and what is the end of
this but inevitable decay, and at last poverty and
ruin?</P>
<P>NAY the more the woman is blameless, the
more certain is his overthrow; for if it was an
expence that was extravagant and unnecessary,
and that his wife ran him out by her high liv∣ing
and gaiety, he might find ways to retrench,
to take up in time, and prevent the mischiet
that is in view; a woman may with kindness
and just reasoning be easily convinced, that her
husband cannot maintain such an expence, as
she now lives at; and let tradesmen say what
they will, and endeavour to excuse themselves
as much as they will, by loading their wives
with the blame of their miscarriage, as I have
known some do, and as old father ADAM,
<PB N="162" REF="179"/>
<HI>tho' in another case,</HI> did before them, I must
say so much in the woman's behalf at a ven∣ture;
it will be very hard to make me believe
that any woman, that was not fit for <HI>Bedlam,</HI>
if her husband truly and timely represented his
case to her, and how far he was or was not a∣ble
to maintain the expence of their way of
living, would not comply with her husband's
circumstances, and retrench her expences, ra∣ther
than go on for a while, and come to po∣verty
and misery: Let then the tradesman lay
it early and seriously before his wife and with
kindness and plainness tell her his circumstan∣ces,
or never let him pretend to charge her with
being the cause of his ruin; let him tell her
how great his annual expence is; for a woman
who receives what she wants as she wants it, that
only takes it with one hand, and lays it out with
another, does not, and perhaps cannot, always
keep an account, or cast up how much it comes
to by the year; let her husband therefore, I say,
tell her honestly how much his expence for her
and himself amounts to yearly; and tell her as
honestly, that it is too much for him, that his
income in trade will not answer it; that he
goes backward, and the last year his family ex∣pences
amounted to so much, say 400 <HI>l.</HI> (for
that is but an ordinary sum now for a tradesman
to spend, whatever it has been esteem'd former∣ly)
and that his whole trade, tho' he made no
bad debts, and had no losses, brought him in
but 320 <HI>l.</HI> the whole year, so that he was 80 <HI>l.</HI>
that year a worse man than he was before; that
this coming year he had met with a heavy loss
<PB N="163" REF="180"/>
already, having had a shop-keeper in the coun∣try
broke in his debt 200 <HI>l.</HI> and that he offer'd
but eight shillings in the pound, so that he should
lose 120 <HI>l.</HI> by him, and that this added to the
80 <HI>l.</HI> run out last year came to 200 <HI>l.</HI> and that
if they went on thus, they should be soon re∣duc'd.</P>
<P>WHAT could the woman say to so reasonable
a discourse, if she was a woman of any sense,
<HI>but to reply,</HI> she would do any thing that lay in
her to assist him, and if her way of living was
too great for him to support, she would lessen
it as he should direct, or as much as he thought
was reasonable? and thus going hand in hand,
she and he together abating what reason requir'd,
they might bring their expences within the com∣pas
of their gettings, and be able to go on a∣gain
comfortably.</P>
<P>BUT now, when the man finding his expences
greater than his income, and yet when he looks
into those expences finds that his wife is frugal
too, and industrious, and applies diligently to
the managing her family, and bringing up her
children, spends nothing idly, saves every thing
that can be sav'd, that instead of keeping too
many servants is a servant to every body her
self; and that in short, when he makes the strict∣est
examination, finds she lays out nothing but
what is absolutely necessary, what now must this
man do? he is ruin'd inevitably; for all his ex∣pence
is necessary, there is no retrenching, no
abating any thing.</P>
<P>THIS I say is the worst case of the two in∣deed;
and this man, tho' he may say he is un∣done
<PB N="164" REF="181"/>
done by marrying, yet cannot blame the wo∣man,
and say he is undone by his wife: This is
the very case I am speaking of; the man should
not have married so soon, he should have staid
'till he had, by pushing on his trade and living
close in his expence, encreased his stock, and
been what we call before-hand in the world;
and had he done thus, he had not been undone
by marrying.</P>
<P>IT is a little hard to say it, but in this respect
it is very true, there is many a young tradesman
ruined by marrying a good wife: in which pray
take notice that I observe my own just distincti∣on;
I do not say they are ruin'd or undone by
a good wife, or by their wives being good, but
by their marrying, their unseasonable, early, and
hasty marrying, before they had cast up the cost
of one, or the income of the other; before they
had enquir'd into the necessary charge of a wife
and a family, or seen the profits of their busi∣ness,
whether it would maintain them, or no;
and whether, as above, they could pay the
charges, the encreasing necessary charge of a
large and growing family. How to persuade
young men to consider this in time, and beware
and avoid the mischief of it, that is a question
by itfelf.</P>
<P>LET no man then, when he is brought to di∣stress
by this early rashness, turn short upon his
wife, and reproach her with being the cause of
his ruin; unless at the same time he can charge
her with extravagant living, needless expence,
squandring away his money, spending it in tri∣fles
and toys, and running him out 'till the shop
<PB N="165" REF="182"/>
could not maintain, the kitchen, much less the
parlour; nor even then, unless he had given
her timely notice of it, and warn'd her that he
was not able to maintain so large a family, or
so great an expence; and that therefore she
would do well to consider of it, and manage
with a straighter hand, and the like; If indeed
he had done so, and she had not comply'd with
him, then she had been guilty, and without ex∣cuse
too; but as the woman cannot judge of his
affairs, and he sees and bears a share in the riot∣ous
way of their living, and does not either shew
his dislike of it, or let her know by some means
or other that he cannot support it, the woman
cannot be charg'd with being his ruin, no tho'
her way of extravagant expensive living were re∣ally
the cause of it: I met with a short dialogue
the other day between a tradesman and his wife
upon such a subject as this, some part of which
may be instructing in the case before us.</P>
<P>THE tradesman was very melancholy for two
or three days, and had appear'd all that time to
be pensive and sad, and his wife with all her
arts, entreaties, anger, tears, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> could not get
it out of him; only now and then she heard
him fetch a deep sigh, and at another time say
<HI>he wish'd he was dead,</HI> and the like expressions:
At last she began the discourse with him in a
respectful, obliging manner, but with the utmost
importunity to get it out of him thus:</P>
<SP>

<P>I thank you, <HI>my Dear,</HI> for that; but
still, tho' 'tis some satisfaction to me to be as∣sur'd

and doubtful; I entreat you <HI>be plain and free

<P>THAT'S true, <HI>my Dear;</HI> and it may

look little in the eyes of the world, for you
know they judge all by out-sides, that I could
not bear it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>IT would be a great deal more cruel
to let me run on, and be really an instrument

I was within the compass of your gettings, and
that a great way; and you know you always
prompted me to go fine, to treat handsomly, to
keep more servants, and every thing of that kind;
could I doubt but that you could afford it very
well?</P>

<P>AY, at last perhaps I might, when
things had been past recovery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>THAT is to say, when you were ruin'd
and undone, and could not shew your head, I
should know it; or when a <HI>statute of bank∣rupt</HI>
had come out, and the creditors had come
<PB N="170" REF="187"/>
and turn'd us out of doors, then I should have
known it; that would have been a barbarous sort
of kindness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHAT could I do? I could not help it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>JUST so our old acquaintance G—W—
did; his poor wife knew not one word of it,
nor so much as suspected it, but thought him
in as flourishing circumstances as ever; 'till on
a sudden he was arrested in an action for a great
sum, so great that he could not find bail, and
the next day an execution on another action
was serv'd in the house, and swept away the
very bed from under her; and the poor lady,
that brought him 3000 <HI>l.</HI> portion, was turn'd
into the street with five small children to take
care of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>HER case was very sad indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT was not he a barbarous wretch to
her, to let her know nothing of her circum∣stances?
she was at the Ball but the day before,
in her velvet suit, and with her jewels on, and
they reproach her with it every day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>SHE did go too fine indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>DO you think she would have done so,
if she had known any thing of his circumstan∣ces?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>IT may be not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, she is a lady of too much sense
to allow us to suggest it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND why did he not let her have
some notice of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHY, he makes the same dull excuse
you speak of; he could not bear to speak to
her of it, and it look'd so unkind to do any
<PB N="171" REF="188"/>
thing to streighten her, he could not do it, it
would break his heart, and the like; and now
he has broke her heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know 'tis hard to break in upon one's
wife in such a manner, where there is any true kindnefs and affection, but—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But!</HI> but what? was there really a
true kindness and affection, as is the pretence,
it would be quite otherwise; he would not break
his own heart forsooth, but chose rather to break
his wife's heart! he could not be so cruel to
tell her of it, and therefore left her to be cru∣elly
and villainously insulted, as she was, by
the bailiffs and creditors; was that his kindness
to her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, <HI>my Dear,</HI> I have not brought
you to that, I hope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, <HI>my Dear,</HI> and I hope you will
not; however, you shall not say I will not do
every thing I can to prevent it, and if it lies on
my side, you are safe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHAT will you do to prevent it?
come, let's see, what can you do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHY first, I have kept five maids you
see, and a footman; I shall immediately give
three of my maids warning, and the fellow also,
and save you that part of the expence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you do that? you can't do
your business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, there's no body knows what
they can do 'till they are tried: two maids may
do all my house-business, and I'll look after my
children myself; and if I live to see them grown
a little bigger, I'll make them help one another,
<PB N="172" REF="189"/>
and keep but one maid; I hope that will be
one step towards helping it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND what wilt all your friends and ac∣quaintance,
and the world, say to it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>NOT half so much as they would to
see you break, and the world believe it to be
by my high living, keeping a house full of ser∣vants,
and do nothing myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>THEY will say I am going to break
upon your doing thus, and that's the way to
make it so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had rather a hundred should say you
were going to break, than one could say you
were really broke already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT 'tis dangerous to have it talk'd
of, <HI>I say.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, they will say we are taking
effectual ways to prevent breaking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT it will put a slur upon yourself
too, I can't bear any mortifications upon you,
any more than I can upon myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>DON'T tell me of mortifications, it
would be a worse mortification a thousand times
over, to have you ruin'd, and have your credit∣ors
insult me with being the occasion of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very kind in you, <HI>my Dear,</HI> and I must always acknowledge it; but however I
would not have you streighten yourself too much
neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>NAY, this will not be so much a mor∣tification,
as the natural consequence of other
things, for in order to abate the expence of
our living, I resolve to keep less company; I
assure you I will lay down all the state of liv∣ing;
<PB N="173" REF="190"/>
as well as the expence of it; and first, I
will keep no visiting days; secondly, I'll drop
the greatest part of the acquaintance I have;
thirdly, I will lay down our treats, and enter∣tainments,
and the like needless occasions of
expence, and then I shall have no occasion for so
many maids.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT this, <HI>my Dear,</HI> I say, will make
as much noise almost, as if I was actually broke.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, leave that part to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT you may tell me how you will
manage it then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHY I'll go into the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>THAT will but bring them after you,
as it us'd to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT I'll put off our usual lodgings at
<HI>Hamstead,</HI> and give out that I am gone to spend
the summer in <HI>Bedfordshire,</HI> at my aunt—'s
where every body knows I us'd to go some∣times;
they can't come after me thither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT when you return, they will all
visit you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>YES, and I will make no return to all
those I have a mind to drop, and there's an end
of all their acquaintance at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND what must I do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>NAY, <HI>my Dear,</HI> 'tis not for me to di∣rect
that part; you know how to cure the evil
which you sensibly feel the mischief of; if I do
my part, I don't doubt you know how to do
yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>YES, <HI>I know,</HI> but 'tis hard, very hard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>

<P>THE question to me is not whether 'tis

<SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>IT is sad work to come down hill
thus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>'TWOULD be worse to fall down at one
blow from the top; better slide gently and vo∣luntarily
down the smooth part, than to be push'd
down the precipice, and be dash'd all in pieces.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>THERE</HI> was more of this dialogue, but I
give you the part which I think most to the
present purposes; and as I strive to shorten the
doctrine, so I will abridge the application also;
the substance of the case lies in a few particu∣lars
thus;</P>
<P>I. THE man was melancholy, and oppress'd
with the thoughts of his declining circumstan∣ces,
and yet had not any thought of letting
<PB N="175" REF="194"/>
his wife know it, whose way of living was high
and expensive, and more than he could support;
but tho` it must have ended in ruin, he would
rather let it have gone on 'till she was surprised
in it, than to tell her the danger that was before
her.</P>
<Q>HIS wife very well argues the injustice and
unkindness of such usage, and how hard
it was to a wife, who being of necessity
to suffer in the fall, ought certainly to have
the most early notice of it; that if possible
she might prevent it, or at least that she
might not be overwhelmed with the sud∣denness
and the terror of it.</Q>
<P>II. UPON discovering it to his wife, or ra∣ther
her drawing the discovery from him by
her importunity, the immediately, and most rea∣dily
and chearfully, enters into measures to re∣trench
her expences, and, as far as she was able,
to prevent the blow, which was otherwise ap∣parent
and unavoidable.</P>
<Q>HENCE 'tis apparent, that the expensive living
of most tradesmen in their families, is for
want of a serious acquainting their wives
with their circumstances, and acquainting
them also <HI>in time;</HI> for there are very few
of the ladies so unreasonable, who, if their
husbands seriously inform'd them how
things stood with them, and that they could
not support their way of living, would not
<PB N="176" REF="195"/>
willingly come into measures to prevent
their own destruction.</Q>
<P>III. THAT 'tis in vain, as well as unequal, for a
tradesman to preach frugality to his wife, and
to bring his wife to a retrenching of her expen∣ces,
and not at the same time to retrench his
own; seeing that keeping horses and high com∣pany
is every way as great and expensive, and
as necessary to be abated as any of the family
extravagances, let them be which they will.</P>
<P>ALL, this relates to the duty of a tradesman
in preventing his family-expences being ruinous
to his business; but the true method to prevent
all this, and never to let it come so far, is still,
as I said before, not to marry too soon; not to
marry, 'till by a frugal industrious management
of his trade in the beginning, he has laid a foun∣dation
for maintaining a wife, and bringing up
a family, and has made an essay by which he
knows what he can, and cannot do; and also
before he has laid up and encreased his stock,
that he may not cripple his fortune at first, and
be ruin'd before he has begun to thrive.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the tradesman's leaving his business to
servants.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is the ordinary excuse of the gentlemen
tradesmen of our times, that they have
good servants; and that therefore they take
more liberty - to be out of their business,
than they would otherwise do: <HI>O! says the
shopkeeper,</HI> I have an apprentice, 'tis an estate
to have: such a servant; I am as safe in him as
if I had my eye upon the business from morn∣ing
to night; let me be where I will, I am al∣ways
satisfied he is at home; if I am at the tavern,
I am sure he is in the compting-house, or be∣hind
the counter; he is never out of his post.</P>
<P>AND then for my other servants, the young∣er
apprentices, <HI>says he,</HI> 'tis all one as if I were
there myself; they would be idle it may be,
but he won't let them I assure you; they must
stick close to it, or he will make them do it; he
tells them, boys do not come apprentices to play,
but to work; not to sit idle, and be doing no∣thing,
but to mind their master's business, that
they may learn how to do their own.</P>
<P>VERY well; and <HI>you think, Sir,</HI> this young
man being so much in the shop, and so diligent
<PB N="178" REF="197"/>
and faithful is an estate to you, and so indeed
it is; but are your customers as well pleas'd with
this man too, as you are? or are they as well
pleas'd with him, as they would be, if you were
there yourself.</P>
<P>YES, they are, says the shop-keeper; nay, abun∣dance
of the customers take him for the master
of the shop, and don't know any other; and
he is so very obliging, and pleases so well, giv∣ing
content to every body, that if I am at any
other part of the shop, and see him serving a
customer, I never interrupt them, unless some∣times
he is so modest he will call me, and turn∣ing
to the ladies say, <HI>There's my master, Madam,</HI>
if you think he will abate you any thing I`ll call
him; and sometimes they will look a little sur∣prised,
and say, is that your master? indeed we
thought you had been the master of the shop
yourself.</P>
<P>WELL, <HI>said I,</HI> and you think yourself very
happy in all this, don't you? pray how long
has this young gentleman to serve? how long is
it before his time will be out? O, he has al∣most
a year and half to serve, says the shop-keeper.
I hope then, <HI>say I,</HI> you will take care
to have him knock'd on the head, as soon as
his time is out. God forbid, says <HI>the honest
man,</HI> what do you mean by that? mean! <HI>say
I,</HI> why if you don't, he will certainly knock
your trade on the head as soon as the year and
half comes to be up; either you must dispose
of him, as I say, or take care that he does not
set up near you, no, not in the same street;
if you do, your customers will all run thither;
<PB N="179" REF="198"/>
when they miss him in the shop, they will pre∣sently
enquire for him; and as, you say, they
generally take him for the master, they will ask
whether the gentleman, is remov'd that kept the
shop before.</P>
<P>ALL <HI>my shop-keeper</HI> could say, was, that he
had got a salve for that store; and that was, that
when <HI>Timothy</HI> was out of his time, <HI>that was
his name,</HI> he resolv'd to take him in partner.</P>
<P>A very good thing indeed! so you must take
<HI>Timothy</HI> into half the trade when he is out of
his time, for fear he should run away with three
quarters of it, when he sets up for himself.
But had not the master much better have been
<HI>Timothy</HI> himself? then he had been sure never
to have the customers take <HI>Timothy</HI> for the ma∣ster,
and when he went away, and set up per∣haps
at next door, leave the shop, and run after
him.</P>
<P>'Tis certain, a good servant, a faithful, in∣dustrious,
obliging servant is a blessing to a
tradesman, and, <HI>as he said,</HI> is an estate to his
master: but the master, by laying the stress of
his business upon him, divests himself of all the
advantages of such a servant, and turns the bles∣sing
into a blast; for by giving up the shop, as
it were, to him, and indulging himself in be∣ing
abroad, and absent from his business, the
apprentice gets the mastery of the business, the
same of the shop depends upon him, and when
he sets up, certainly follows him; such a ser∣vant
would with the master's attendance too, be
very helpful, and yet not be dangerous; such a servant is well, when he is visibly an assistant
<PB N="180" REF="199"/>
to the master, but is ruinous when he is taken
for the master. There is a great deal of diffe∣rence
between a servant's being <HI>the stay</HI> of his
master, and his being <HI>the stay</HI> of his trade;
when he is <HI>the first,</HI> the master is serv'd by him,
and when he is gone he breeds up another to
follow his steps; but when he is <HI>the last,</HI> he
carries the trade with him, and does his master
infinitely more hurt than good.</P>
<P>A tradesman has a great deal of trouble with
a bad servant, but must take heed he is not
wounded by a good one: the extravagant idle
vagrant servant hurts himself, but the diligent
servant endangers his master; the greater repu∣tation
the servant gets in his business, the more
care the master has upon him, lest he gets
within him, and worms him out of his busi∣ness.</P>
<P>THE only way to prevent this, and yet not
injure a diligent servant, is, that the master be
as diligent as the servant, that the master be as
much at the shop as the man: he that will
keep in his business, need never fear keeping
his business, let his servant be as diligent as
he will. 'Tis a hard thing that a tradesman
should have the blessing of a good servant, and
make it a curse to him by his appearing less ca∣pable
than his man.</P>
<P>LET your apprentice be in the business, but
let the master be at the head of the business
at all times: there is a great deal of difference
between being diligent in the business <HI>in the
shop,</HI> and leading the whole business <HI>of the shop;</HI>
an apprentice who is diligent may be master of
<PB N="181" REF="200"/>
his business, but should never be master of the
shop; the one is to be useful to his master, the
other is to be master of his master; and indeed
this shews the absolute necessity of diligence
and application in a tradesman, and how, for
want of it, that very thing which is the bles∣sing
of another tradesman's business, is the ruin
of his.</P>
<P>SERVANTS, especially apprentices, ought to
be considered, as they really are, in their move∣able
station, that they are here with you but
seven years, and that then they act or move in a
sphere or station of their own; their dili∣gence
is now for you, but ever after it is for
themselves; that the better servants they have
been while they were with you, the more dan∣gerous
they will be to you when you part;
that therefore, tho' you are bound in justice to
them to let them into your business in every
branch of it, yet you are not bound to give
your business away to them; the diligence
therefore of a good servant in the master's busi∣ness
should be a spur to the master's diligence
to take care of himself.</P>
<P>THERE is a great deal of difference also be∣tween
trusting a servant in your business, and
trusting him with your business: the first is leav∣ing
your business with him, the other is leaving
your business to him; he that trusts a servant in
his business, leaves his shop only to him; but
he that leaves his business to his servant, leaves
his wife and children at his dispose: <HI>in a word,</HI>
such a trusting or leaving the business to the
servant is no less than a giving up all to him,
<PB N="182" REF="201"/>
abandoning the care of his shop and all his af∣fairs
to him; and when such a servant is out
of his time the master runs a terrible risque,
such as indeed it is not fit any tradesman should
run, namely, of losing the best of his business.</P>
<P>WHAT I have been now saying, is of the
tradesman leaving his business to his apprentices
and servants, when they prove good, when
they are honest and diligent, faithful and in∣dustrious;
and if there are dangers even in
trusting good servants, and such as do their du∣ty
perfectly well, what then must it be when
the business is left to idle, negligent and ex∣travagant
servants, who both neglect their mas∣ter's
business and their own, who neither learn
their trade for themselves, or regard it for the
interest of their masters? if the first are a bles∣sing
to their masters, and may only be made
dangerous by their carrying away the trade
with them when they go, these are made
curses to their masters early, for they lose the
trade for themselves and their masters too.
The first carry the customers away with them,
the last drive the customers away before they
go. What signifies going to such a shop, <HI>say
the Ladies,</HI> either speaking of a mercer or dra∣per,
or any other trade? there's nothing to be
met with there but a crew of saucy boys
that are always at play when you come in, and can
hardly refrain it when you are there; one hard∣ly
ever sees a master in the shop, and the young
rude boys hardly mind you when you are look∣ing
on their goods; they talk to you as if they
cared not whether you laid out your money or
<PB N="183" REF="202"/>
no, and as if they had rather you were gone,
that they might go to play again; <HI>I'll go there
no mores, not I.</HI></P>
<P>IF this be not the case, then you are in dan∣ger
of worse still, and that is, that they are of∣ten
thieves; <HI>idle ones</HI> are seldom <HI>honest ones;</HI>
nay, they cannot indeed be honest in a strict
sense if they are idle: but by dishonest, I mean
downright thieves; and what is more dangerous
than for an apprentice, to whom the whole bu∣siness,
the cash, the books, and all is commit∣ted,
to be a thief?</P>
<P>FOR a tradesman therefore to commit his bu∣siness
thus into the hand of a false, a negligent
and a thievish servant, is like a man that travels
a journey, and takes a highway man into the
coach with him; such a man is sure to be rob∣bed,
and to be fully and effectually plundered,
because he discovers where he hides his treasure.
Thus the tradesman places his confidence in the
thief, and how should he avoid being robb'd?</P>
<P>IT is answered, that generally tradesmen, who
have any considerable trust to put into the hands
of an apprentice, take security of them for their
honesty by their friends, when their indentures
are sign'd, and 'tis their fault then, if they are
not secure. It is true, 'tis often so; but in a
retail business, if the servant be unfaithful, there
are so many ways to defraud a master, besides
that of merely not ballancing the cash, that 'tis
impossible to detect them; and unless provi∣dence,
<HI>as sometimes it does,</HI> makes the disco∣very
by wonder and miracle, 'tis never found
out at all; till the tradesman declining insensibly
<PB N="184" REF="203"/>
by the weight of the loss is ruin'd and un∣done.</P>
<P>WHAT need then has the tradesman to give
a close attendance, and preserve himself from
plunder, by acquainting himself in and with
his business and servants, by which he makes it
very difficult for them to deceive him, and
much easier to him to discover it if he suspects
them: but if the tradesman lives abroad, keeps
at his country-house or lodgings, and leaves his
business thus in the hands of his servants, com∣mitting
his affairs to them, as is often the case,
if they prove thieves, negligent, careless and
idle, what is the consequence? he is insensibly
wrong'd, his substance wasted, his business neglected;
and how shall a tradesman thrive un∣der
such circumstances? Nay, how is it possible
he should avoid ruin and destruction? I mean,
as to his business; for in short, every such ser∣vant
has his hand in his master's pocket, and
may use him as he pleases.</P>
<P>AGAIN, if they are not thieves, yet if they
are idle and negligent, 'tis in some cases the
same thing; and I wish it were well recom∣mended
to all such servants as call themselves
honest, that it is as criminal to neglect their
master's business, as to rob him; and he is as
really a thief who robs him of his time, as he
that robs him of his money.</P>
<P>I know, <HI>as servants are now,</HI> this is a prin∣ciple
they will not allow, neither does one ser∣vant
in fifty act by it; but if the master be
absent, the servant is at his heels; that is to
say, is as soon out of doors as his master, and
<PB N="185" REF="204"/>
having none but his conscience to answer to,
he makes shift to compound with himself, like
a bankrupt with his creditor, to pay half the
debt; that is to say, half the time to his master,
and half to himself, and think it good pay
too.</P>
<P>THE point of conscience indeed seems to be
out of the question now, between master and
servant; and as few masters concern themselves
with the souls, nay, scarce with the morals of
their servants, either to instruct them, or inform
them of their duty either to GOD or <HI>man,</HI> much
less to restrain them by force, or correct them,
as was antiently practised; so, few servants con∣cern
themselves in a conscientious discharge of
their duty to their masters: so that the great
law of subordination is destroy'd, and the rela∣tive
duties on both sides are neglected; all
which, as I take it, is owing to the exorbitant
sums of money which are now given with ser∣vants
to the masters, as the present or condition
of their apprenticeship; which as it is extrava∣gant
in it self, so it gives the servant a kind of
a different figure in the family, places him above
the ordinary class of servants hired for wages,
and exempts him from all the laws of family-government;
so that a master seems now to
have nothing to do with his apprentice, any
other than in what relates to his business.</P>
<P>AND as the servant knows this, so he fails
not to take the advantage of it, and to pay no
more service than he thinks is due; and the
hours of his shop business being run out, he
claims all the rest for himself, without <HI>the a∣bove</HI>
<PB N="186" REF="205"/>
restraint. Nor will the servants in these
times bear any examinations with respect to the
disposing of their waste time, or with respect
to the company they keep, or the houses or
places they go to.</P>
<P>THE use I make of it is this, and herein it is
justly applicable to the case in hand; by how
much the apprentices and servants in this age
are loose, wild, and ungovernable, by so much
the more should a master think himself ob∣liged
not to depend upon them, much less to
leave his business to them, and dispense with his
own attendance in it; if he does, he must have
much better luck than his neighbours if he
does not find himself very much wrong'd and
abused, seeing, <HI>as I said above,</HI> the servants
and apprentices of this age do very rarely act
from a principle of conscience in serving their
masters interest; which however I do not see
they can be good christians without.</P>
<P>I knew one very considerable tradesman in
this city, and who had always five or six ser∣vants
in his business, apprentices and journey∣men
who lodged in his house, and having a
little more the spirit of government in him
than most masters I now meet with, he took
this method with them; when he took an ap∣prentice
he told them beforehand the orders of
his family, and which he should oblige them to;
particularly, that they should none of them be
absent from his business without leave, nor out
of the house after nine a clock at night; and
that he would not have it thought hard, if he
exacted three things of them:</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="206"/>
1. THAT if they had been out he should ask
them where they had been, and in what com∣pany?
and that they should give him a true and
direct answer.</P>
<P>2. THAT if he found reason to forbid them
keeping company with any particular person,
or in any particular house or family, they should
be obliged to refrain from such company.</P>
<P>3. THAT in breach of any of those two, af∣ter
being positively charg'd with it, he would
on their promising to amend it, forgive them,
only acquainting their friends of it; but the
second time he would dismiss them his service,
and not be oblig'd to return any of the money
he had with them. And to these he made
their parents consent when they were bound;
and yet he had large sums of money with them
too; not less than two hundred pounds each,
and sometimes more.</P>
<P>As to his journeymen, he conditioned with
them <HI>as follows:</HI></P>
<P>1. THEY should never dine from home with∣out
leave asked and obtained, and telling where,
<HI>if required.</HI></P>
<P>2. AFTER the shutting in of the shop, they
were at liberty to go where they pleased, only
not to be out of the house after nine a clock
at night.</P>
<P>3. NEVER to be in drink, or to swear, on
pain of being immediately dismiss'd without the
courtesy usual with such servants, <HI>viz.</HI> of a
month's warning.</P>
<P>THESE were excellent houshold laws, but the
question is, how shall a master see them
<PB N="188" REF="207"/>
punctually obey'd; for the life of all laws de∣pends
upon their being well executed; and we
are famous in <HI>England</HI> for being remiss in that
very point; and that <HI>we have the best laws the
worst executed</HI> of any nation in the world.</P>
<P>BUT my friend was a man who knew as well
how to make his laws be well executed, as he
did how to make the laws themselves. His
case was thus, he kept a country house about
two miles from <HI>London,</HI> in the summer-time,
for the air for his wife and children, and there
he maintained them very comfortably: but it
was a rule with him, that he who expects his
servants to obey his orders, must be always up∣on
the spot with them to see it done; to this
purpose he confined himself to lie always at
home, tho' his family was in the country; and
every afternoon he walk'd out to see them, and
to give himself the air too; but always so or∣dered
his diversions, that he was sure to be at
home before nine at night, that he might call
over his family, and see that they observ'd or∣ders;
that is, that they were all at home at
their time, and all sober.</P>
<P>AS this was indeed the only way to have good
servants, and an orderly family, so he had
both; but it was owing much, if not all, to
the exactness of his government; and would all
masters take the same method, I doubt not
they would have the like success; but what ser∣vants
can a man expect when he leaves them
to their own government, not regarding whe∣ther
they serve GOD or the <HI>Devil?</HI>
<PB N="189" REF="208"/>
Now though this man had a very regular fa∣mily,
and very good servants, yet he had this
particular qualification too for a good trades∣man,
<HI>viz.</HI> that he never left his business entire∣ly
to them, nor could any of them boast, that
they were trusted to, more than another.</P>
<P>THIS is certainly the way to have regular ser∣vants,
and to have business thrive; but this is
not practised by one master to a thousand at
this time; if it were, we should soon see a
change in the families of tradesmen, and that
very much for the better: nor indeed would
this family-government be good for the trades∣men
only, but it would be the servant's advan∣tage
too: and such a practice we may say would
in time reform all the next age, and make them
asham'd of us that went before them.</P>
<P>IF then the morals of servants are thus loose
and debauched, and that it is a general and epi∣demick
evil, how much less ought tradesmen of
this age to trust them, and still less to venture
their all upon them, leave their great design,
the event of all their business with them, and
go in the country in persuit of their pleasure.</P>
<P>THE case of tradesmen differs extremely in
this age from those in the last, with respect to
their apprentices and servants; and the difference
in all to the disadvantge of the present age, <HI>viz.</HI>
in the last age, <HI>that is to say,</HI> fifty or sixty years
ago, <HI>for it is not less,</HI> servants were infinitely
more under subjection than they are now, and
the subordination of mankind extended effectu∣ally
to them; they were content to submit to
family-governtment; and the just regulations,
<PB N="190" REF="209"/>
which masters made in their houses, were
not scorn'd and contemn'd as they are now;
family-religion also had some sway upon them,
and, if their masters did keep good orders, and
preserve the worship of God in their houses, the
apprentices thoughts themselves obliged to at∣tend
at the usual hours for such services; nay,
it has been known, where such orders have
been observ'd, that if the master of the family
has been sick, or indisposed, or out of town,
the eldest apprentice has read prayers to the fa∣mily
in his place.</P>
<P>HOW ridiculous, to speak in the language of
the present times, would it be for any master
to expect this of a servant in our days? and
where is the servant that would comply with
it? nay, 'tis but very rare now, that masters
themselves do it; 'tis rather thought now to
be a low step, and beneath the character of a
man in business, as if worshipping God was a
disgrace, and not an honour to a family, or to
the master of a family; and I doubt not but in
a little while more, either the worship of God
will be quite banish'd out of families, or the
better sort of tradesmen, and such as have any
regard to it, will keep Chaplains, <HI>as other per∣sons
of quality do.</HI> It is confess'd, the first is
most probable, tho' the last, as I am inform'd,
is already begun in the city, in some houses,
where the reader of the parish is allow'd a small
additional salary to come once a day, <HI>viz.</HI> eve∣ry
evening, to read prayers in the house.</P>
<P>BUT I am not talking on this subject; I am
not directing myself to citizens or townsmen,
<PB N="191" REF="210"/>
as masters of families, but as heads of trade,
and masters in their business; the other part
would indeed require a whole book by itself,
and would insensibly run me into a long saty∣rical
discourse upon the loss of all family-go∣vernment
among us; in which indeed the pra∣ctice
of house-keepers and heads of families is
grown not remiss only in all serious things, but
even scandalous in their own morals, and in the
personal examples they shew to their servants,
and all about them.</P>
<P>BUT to come back to my subject, <HI>viz.</HI> that
the case of tradesmen differs extremely from
what it was formerly: the second head of dif∣ference
is this; that whereas in former times
the servants were better and humbler than they
are now, submitted more to family-government,
and to the regulations made by their masters,
and masters were more moral, set better exam∣ples,
and kept better order in their houses, and
by consequence of it all servants were soberer,
and fitter to be trusted than they are now; yet
on the other hand, notwithstanding all their so∣bri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty,
matters did not then so much depend
upon them, leave business to them, and com∣mit
the management of their affairs so entirely
to their servants, as they do now.</P>
<P>ALL <HI>that I meet with,</HI> which masters have
to say to this, is contain'd in two heads, and
those in my opinion amount to very little.</P>
<P>I. THAT they have security for their servants
honesty, which in former times they had not.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="211"/>
II. THAT they receive greater proemio's, or
present-money, now with their apprentices, than
they did formerly.</P>
<P>THE first of these is of no moment; for <HI>first,</HI>
it does not appear, that apprentices in those
former days gave no security to their masters for
their integrity, which, tho' perhaps not so ge∣nerally
as now, yet I have good reason to know
was then practised among tradesmen of note,
and is not now among inferior tradesmen:
but, <HI>secondly,</HI> this security extends to nothing,
but to make the master satisfaction for any mis∣applications,
or embezzlements, which are dis∣cover'd,
and can be prov'd, but extend to no
secret conceal'd mischiefs: neither, <HI>thirdly,</HI> do
those securities reach to the negligence, idle∣ness,
or debaucheries of servants; but, <HI>which
is still more than all the rest,</HI> they do not reach
to the worst sort of robbery between the ser∣vant
and his master, I mean <HI>the loss of his time;</HI>
so that still there is as much reason for the ma∣ster's
inspection, both into his servants and their
business, as ever.</P>
<P>BUT least of all does this security reach to
make the master any satisfaction for the loss of
his business, the ill management of his shop,
the disreputation brought upon it by being com∣mitted
to servants, and those servants behaving
ill, slighting, neglecting, or disobliging custom∣ers;
this does not relate to securities given or
taken, nor can the master make himself any a∣mends
upon his servant, or upon his securities,
for this irrecoverable damage. He therefore, that
<PB N="193" REF="212"/>
will keep up the reputation of his shop, or of
his business, and preserve his trade to his own
advantage, must resolve to attend it himself,
and not leave it to servants, whether good or
bad; if he leaves it to good servants, they improve
it for themselves, and carry the trade away with
them when they go; if to bad servants, they
drive his customers away, bring a scandal upon
his shop, and destroy both their master and them∣selves.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As to the receiving great proemia's
with their apprentices, which indeed is grown
up to a strange height in this age, beyond what∣ever
it was before; it is an unaccountable ex∣cess,
which is the ruin of more servants at this
time, than all the other excesses they are sub∣ject
to; nay, in some respect it is the cause of it
all; and, on the contrary, is far from being an
equivalent to their masters for the defect of their
service, but is an unanswerable reason why the
master should not leave his business to their ma∣nagement.</P>
<P>THIS proemium was originally not a condi∣tion
of indenture, but was a kind of usual or
customary present to the tradesman's wife to en∣gage
her to be kind to the youth, and take a
motherly care of him, being suppos'd to be
young when first put out.</P>
<P>BY length of time this compliment or pre∣sent
became so customary, as to be made a debt,
and to be conditioned for as a demand; but
still was kept within bounds, and thirty or
forty pounds was sufficient to a very good mer∣chant,
which now is run up to five hundred,
<PB N="194" REF="213"/>
nay, to a thousand pounds with an apprentice;
a thing which formerly would have been thought
monstrous, and not to be nam'd.</P>
<P>THE ill consequences of giving these large
proemio's are such and so many, that it is not
to be enter'd upon in such a small tract as this;
nor is it the design of this work: but it is thus
far to the purpose here, <HI>namely,</HI> as it shews,
that this sets up servants into a class of gentle∣men
above their masters, and above their bu∣siness,
and they neither have a sufficient regard
to one or other; and consequently are the less
fit to be trusted by the master in the essential
parts of his business, and this brings it down
to the case in hand.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, the present state of things
between masters and servants is such, that now
more than ever the caution is needful and just,
that he that leaves his business to the manage∣ment
of his servants, 'tis ten to one but he ru∣ins
his business, and his servants too.</P>
<P>RUINING his business is indeed my present
subject; but ruining his servants also is a con∣sideration
that an honest conscientious master
ought to think is of weight with him, and will
concern himself about. Servants out of govern∣ment
are like soldiers without an officer, fit for
nothing but to rob and plunder; without order,
and without orders; they neither know what to
do, or are directed how to do it.</P>
<P>BESIDES 'tis letting loose his apprentices to
levity and liberty in that particular critical time
of life, when they have the most need of go∣vernment
and restraint: when should laws and
<PB N="195" REF="214"/>
limits be useful to mankind but in their youth,
when unlimited liberty is most fatal to them,
and when they are least capable of governing
themselves? to have youth left without govern∣ment
is leaving fire in a magazine of powder,
which will certainly blow it all up at last, and
ruin all the houses that are near it.</P>
<P>IF there is any duty on the side of a master
to his servant, any obligation on him as a chri∣stian,
and as a trustee for his parents, it lies
here; to limit and restrain them, if possible,
in the liberty of doing evil; and this is certain∣ly
a debt due to the trust repos'd in masters by
the parents of the youth committed to them; if
he is let loose here, he is undone of course,
and it may be said indeed, he was ruin'd by
his master; and if the master is afterwards ru∣in'd
by such a servant, what can be said for it
but this? <HI>He could expect no other.</HI></P>
<P>TO leave a youth without government is in∣deed
unworthy of any honest master; he can∣not
discharge himself <HI>as a master;</HI> for instead
of taking care of him he indeed casts him off,
abandons him, and, to put it into scripture
words, he <HI>leads him into temptation;</HI> nay, he
goes farther, to use another scripture expression,
<HI>he delivers him over to Satan.</HI></P>
<P>IT is confess'd, and 'tis fatal both to masters
and servants at this time, that not only ser∣vants
are made haughty, and above the govern∣ment
of their masters, and think it below them
to submit to any family-government, or any re∣straints
of their masters, as to their morals and
religion; but masters also seem to have given
<PB N="196" REF="215"/>
up all family-government, and all care or con∣cern
for the morals and manners, as well as for
the religion of their servants, thinking them∣selves
under no obligation to meddle with those
things, or to think any thing about them, so
that their business be but done, and their shop
or warehouse duly look'd after.</P>
<P>BUT to bring it all home to the point in hand,
if it is so with the master and servant, there is
the less room still for the master of such servants
to leave any considerable trust in the hands of
such apprentices, or to expect much from them;
to leave the weight of their affairs with them,
and living at their country-lodgings, and taking
their own diversions, depend upon such ser∣vants
for the success of their business; this is
indeed abandoning their business, throwing it
away, and committing themselves, families, and
fortunes, to the conduct of those, who they have
all the reason in the world to believe have no
concern upon them for their good, or care one
farthing what becomes of them.</P>

Debtors, or with Creditors.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE is an alternative in the subject
of this letter, which places the dis∣course
in the two extremes of a trades∣man's
fortunes.</P>
<P>I. THE <HI>fortunate tradesman,</HI> call'd upon by
his poor unfortunate neighbour, who is his
debtor, and is become insolvent, to have com∣passion
on him, and to compound with him
for part of his debt, and accept his offer in
discharge of the whole.</P>
<P>II. THE <HI>unfortunate tradesman</HI> become in∣solvent
and bankrupt himself, and applying
himself to his creditor to accept of a compo∣sition,
in discharge of his debt.</P>
<P>I. THE <HI>fortunate tradesman,</HI> call'd upon by
his poor unfortunate neighbour, who is his debt∣or,
and is become insolvent, to have compassion
on him, and to compound with him for part
of his debt, and accept his offer in discharge of
the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="217"/>
I must confess a tradesman, let his circum∣stances
be what they will, has the most reason
to consider the disasters of the unfortunate, and
be compassionate to them under their pressures
and disasters, of any other men; because they
know not, no not the most prosperous of them,
what may be their own fate in the world. There
is a scripture proverb, <HI>if I may call it so,</HI> very
necessary to a tradesman in this case, <HI>Let him
that thinketh he standeth, take heed left he fall.</HI></P>
<Q><HI>N. B.</HI> It is not said, let him that standeth
take heed, but him <HI>that thinketh</HI> he stand∣eth:
men in trade <HI>can but think</HI> they stand;
and there are so many incidents in a trades∣man's
circumstances, that sometimes when
he thinks himself most secure of standing,
he is in most danger of falling.</Q>
<P>IF then the contingent nature of trade ren∣ders
every man liable to disaster that is engag'd
in it, it seems strange that tradesmen should
be outrageous and unmerciful to one another,
when they fall; and yet <HI>so it is,</HI> that no cre∣ditor
is so furious upon an unhappy insolvent
tradesman, as a brother tradesman of his own
class, and who is at least liable to the same dis∣aster
in the common event of his business.</P>
<P>NAY, I have liv'd to see, <HI>such is the uncer∣tainty
of human affairs,</HI> and especially in trade,
the furious and outrageous creditor become bank∣rupt
himself in a few years, or perhaps months
after, and begging the same mercy of others,
which he but just before denied to his <HI>not more</HI>
<PB N="199" REF="218"/>
unfortunate fellow tradesman, and making the
same exclamations at the cruelty and hard hearted∣ness
of his creditors in refusing to comply with
him; when at the same time his own heart must
reproach him with his former conduct, how in∣exorable
he was to all the entreaties and tears
of his miserable neighbour and his distressed fa∣mily,
who begg'd his compassion with the low∣est
submission, who employ'd friends to solicit
and entreat for them, laying forth their miscry
in the most lively expressions, and using all the
arguments which the most moving distress could
dictate, but in vain.</P>
<P>THE tradesman is certainly wrong in this, as
compassion to the miserable is a debt of charity
due from all mankind to their fellow-creatures;
and tho' the purse-proud tradesman may be able
to say, he is above the fear of being in the like
circumstances, as some may be; yet even then
he might reflect, that perhaps there was a time
when he was not so, and he ought to pay that
debt of charity, in acknowledgment of the mer∣cy
that has set him above the danger.</P>
<P>AND yet speaking in the ordinary language
of men, who are subject to vicissitudes of for∣tune,
where is the man that is sure he shall
meet with no shock? and how have we seen
men, who have <HI>to day</HI> been immensely rich,
be <HI>to morrow,</HI> as it were, reduc'd to nothing?
what examples were made in this city of such
precipitations within the memory of some liv∣ing,
when the Exchequer shutting up ruin'd the
great Bankers of <HI>Lombard-street?</HI> to what fell
Sir <HI>Robert Viner,</HI> the great alderman <HI>Backwell,</HI>
<PB N="200" REF="219"/>
the three brothers of the name of <HI>Forth,</HI> of
whom King <HI>Charles</HI> II. made that severe <HI>pun,</HI>
that <HI>three fourths of the city were broke?</HI></P>
<P>TO what have we seen men of prodigious bulk
in trade reduc'd, as Sir <HI>Thomas Cook,</HI> Sir <HI>Basil
Firebrass, Sheppard, Coggs,</HI> and innumerable
bankers, money-scriveners, and merchants, who
thought themselves as secure against the shocks
of trade, as any men in the world could be?
not to instance in our late <HI>South-sea Directors,</HI>
and others, reduc'd by the terrible fate of bub∣bles,
whole names I omit, because they yet live,
tho' sinking still under the oppression of their
fortunes, and whose weight I would be far from
endeavouring to make heavier.</P>
<P>WHY then should any tradesman, presuming
on his own security, and of his being out of
the reach of disaster, harden his heart against
the miseries and distresses of a fellow tradesman,
who sinks as it were by his side, and refuse to
accept his offer of composition; at least, if he
cannot object against the integrity of his repre∣sentations,
and cannot charge him with fraud
and deceit, breaking with a wicked design to
cheat and delude his creditors, and to get mo∣ney
by a pretended breach? I say, why should
any tradesman harden his heart in such a case,
and not with a generous pity comply with a
reasonable and fair proposal, while it is to be
had?</P>
<P>I do acknowledge, if there's an evident fraud,
if he can detect the bankrupt in any wicked de∣sign,
if he can prove he has effects sufficient to
pay his debts, and that he only breaks with a
<PB N="201" REF="220"/>
purpose to cheat his creditors, and he conceals
a part of his estate, when he seems to offer a
sincere surrender; if this be the case, <HI>and it
can be made appear to be so,</HI> for in such a case too,
we ought to be very sure of the fact, then in∣deed
no favour is due, and really none ought
to be shewed.</P>
<P>AND therefore it was a very righteous clause,
which was inflicted on the fraudulent bankrupt,
in a late Act of Parliament, namely, that in case
he conceal'd his effects, and that it appear'd he
had, <HI>tho' upon his oath,</HI> not given in a full ac∣count
of his estate, but willingly and knowingly
conceal'd it, or any part of it, with design to
defraud his creditors, he should be put to death
<HI>as a felon:</HI> the reason, and justice of which clause
was this, and it was given as the reason of it
when the Act was pass'd in the House of Com∣mons,
namely, that the Act was made for the
relief of the debtor, as well as of the creditor,
and to procure for him a deliverance on a sur∣render
of his effects; but then it was made al∣so
for the relief of the creditor too, that he
might have as much of his debt secur'd to him
as possible, and that he should not discharge the
debtor with his estate in his pocket, suffering
him to run away with his (the creditor's) mo∣ney
before his face.</P>
<P>ALSO it was objected, that the act without
a penalty would be only an act to encourage
perjury, and would deliver the hard-mouth'd
knave that could swear what he pleas'd and
ruin and reject the modest conscientious trades∣man,
that was willing and ready to give up the
<PB N="202" REF="221"/>
utmost farthing to his creditors. On this ac∣count
the clause was accepted, and the act
pass'd, which otherwise had been thrown out.</P>
<P>NOW when the poor insolvent has thus sur∣rendred
his all, stript himself entirely upon
oath, and that oath taken on the penalty of
death if it be false; there seems to be a kind of
justice due to the bankrupt, he has satisfy'd the
law, and ought to have his liberty given him
<HI>as a prey,</HI> as the text calls it, <HI>Jer.</HI> xxxix. 18.
that he may try the world once again, and see
if possible to recover his disasters, and get his
bread; and it is to be spoken in honour of
the justice as well as humanity of that law for
delivering bankrupts, that there are more trades∣men
recover themselves in this age upon their
second endeavours, and by setting up again af∣ter
they have thus fail'd, and been deliver'd,
than ever were known to do so in ten times
the number of years before.</P>
<P>TO break, or turn bankrupt, before this, was
like a man being taken by the <HI>Turks,</HI> he sel∣dom
recover'd liberty to try his fortune again,
but frequently languished under the tyranny of
the commissioners of bankrupt, or in the <HI>Mint,</HI>
or <HI>Fryers,</HI> or <HI>rules of the Fleet,</HI> till he wasted
the whole estate, and at length his life, and so
his debts were all paid at once.</P>
<P>NOR was the case of the creditor much bet∣ter;
I mean as far as respected his debt, for it
was very seldom that any considerable dividend
was made, on the other hand, large contribu∣tions
were call'd for before people knew whe∣ther
it was likely any thing would be made of
<PB N="203" REF="222"/>
the debtor's effects or no; and oftentimes the
creditor lost his whole debt, contribution-money
and all; so that while the debtor was kept on
the rack, <HI>as above,</HI> being held in suspence by
the creditors, or by the commissioners, or both,
he spent the creditors effects, and subsisted at
their expence, till the estate being wasted, the
loss fell heavy on every side, and generally most
on those who were least able to bear it.</P>
<P>BY the present state of things, this cvil is in∣deed
altered, and the ruin of the creditors ef∣fects
is better prevented; the bankrupt can no
more skulk behind the door of the <HI>Mint</HI> and
<HI>Rules,</HI> and prevent the commissioners inspecti∣on;
he must come forth, be examined, give in
an account, and surrender himself and effects
too, or fly his country, and be seen here no
more; and if he does come in, he must give a
full account upon oath, on the penalty of his
neck.</P>
<P>WHEN the effects are thus surrendred, the
commissioners proceedings are short and sum∣mary;
the <HI>assignees</HI> are obliged to make dividends,
and not detain the estate in their own hands, as
was the case in former days, till sometimes they
became bankrupts themselves; so that the cre∣ditors
are sure now what is put into the hands
of <HI>the assignees,</HI> shall in due time, and without
the usual delay, be fairly divided: on the other
hand, the poor debtor having honestly discharg'd
his part, and no objection lying against the sin∣cerity
of the discovery, has a certificate granted
him, which being allowed by the Lord Chan∣cellor,
he is a clear man, and may begin the
world again, as I have said above.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="223"/>
THE creditor being thus satisfied that the
debtor has been faithful, does not answer the
end of the Act of Parliament, if he declines to
assent to the debtor's certificate; nor can any
creditor decline it, but on principles which no
man cares to own; namely, that of malice, and
the highest resentment; which are things a
christian tradesman will not easily act upon.</P>
<P>BUT I come now to the other part of the
case; and this is supposing a debtor fails, and
the creditors do not think fit to take out a com∣mission
of bankrupt against him, as sometimes
is the case, at least, where they see the offers
of the debtor are any thing reasonable: my ad∣vice
in such case is, (and I speak it from long
experience in such things,) that they should always
accept the first reasonable proposal of the
debtor; and I am not in this talking on the
foot of charity and mercy to the debtor, but
of the real and undoubted interest of the cre∣ditor;
nor could I urge it, by such arguments
as I shall bring, upon any other foundation;
for if I speak in behalf of the debtor, I must
argue commiseration to the miserable, compas∣sion
and pity of his family, and a reflection up∣on
the sad changes which human life exposes
us all to, and so persuade the creditor to have
pity upon not him only, but upon all families in
distress.</P>
<P>BUT I say I argue now upon a different
foundation, and insist that it is the creditor's
true interest, <HI>as I hinted before,</HI> that if he finds
the debtor inclin'd to be honest, and he sees
reason to believe he makes the best offer he
<PB N="205" REF="224"/>
can; he should accept the first offer, as being
generally the best the debtor can make; and in∣deed,
if the debtor be wise as well as honest,
he will make it so, and generally it is found
to be so: and there are indeed many reasons
why the first offers of the debtor are generally
the best, and why no commission of bankrupt
ordinarily raises so much, not withstanding all
its severities, as the bankrupt offers before it is
sued out; not reckoning the time and expence
which, <HI>notwithstanding all the new methods,</HI>
attend such things, and are inevitable. <HI>For
example,</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the debtor first <HI>looking into his affairs</HI>
sees the necessity coming upon him of making
a stop in trade, and calling his creditors toge∣ther,
the first thought which by the consequene
of the thing comes to be considered, is, what
offers he can make to them to avoid the having
a commission sued out against him, and to
which end common prudence, as well as honest
principles, moves him to make the best offers
he can. If he be a man of sense, and, accord∣ing
to what I mentioned in my other letter,
has prudently come to a stop in time, before
things are run to extremities, and while he has
something left to make an offer of that may
be considerable, he will seldom meet with cre∣ditors
so weak or so blind to their own inte∣rest,
not to be willing to end it amicably, ra∣ther
than to proceed to a commission. And as
this is certainly best both for the debtor and
the creditor; so, as I argued with the debtor,
that he should be wise enough, as well as ho∣nest
<PB N="206" REF="225"/>
enough to break betimes, and that it was
infinitely best for his own interest; so I must
add, on the other hand, to the creditor, that
'tis always his interest to accept the first offer:
and I never knew a commission make more of
an estate where the debtor has been honest,
than he (the debtor) proposed to give them
without it.</P>
<P>IT is true, there are cases where the issuing
out a commission may be absolutely necessary.
<HI>For example,</HI></P>
<P>1. WHERE the debtor is evidently knavish,
and discovers himself to be so, by endeavours
to carry off his effects, or alter the property of
the estate confessing judgments, or any the u∣sual
ways of fraud, which in such cases are or∣dinarily
practised. Or,</P>
<P>2. WHERE some creditors, by such judgments,
or by attachments of debts, goods delivered, ef∣fects
made over, or any other way, have gotten
some of the estate into their hands, or securi∣ties
belonging to it, whereby they are in a bet∣ter
state, as to payment, than the rest. Or,</P>
<P>3. WHERE some people are brought in as
creditors, whose debts there is reason to believe
are not real; but who place themselves in the
room of creditors, in order to receive a divi∣dend
for the use of the bankrupt, or some of
his family.</P>
<P>IN these <HI>and such like</HI> cases, a commission is
inevitable, and must be taken out; nor does
the man merit to be regarded upon the foot of
what I call compassion and commiseration at
all; but ought to be treated like a rapparee or
<PB N="207" REF="226"/>
plunderer, who breaks with a design to make
himself whole by the composition; and as ma∣ny
did formerly, who were beggars when they
broke, be made rich by the breach: It was to
provide against such harpyes as these, that the
Act of Parliament was made; and the only re∣medy
against them is a commission, in which
the best thing they can do for their creditors,
is to come in and be examined, give in a false
account upon oath, be discovered, convicted of
it, and sent to the gallows, as they deserve.</P>
<P>BUT I am speaking of honest men, the reverse
of such thieves as these, who being brought
into distress by the ordinary calamities of trade,
are willing to do the utmost to satisfy their cre∣ditors:
when such as these break in the trades∣man's
debt, let him consider seriously my ad∣vice,
and he shall find, I might say he shall <HI>al∣ways</HI>
find, but I do affirm, he shall <HI>generally</HI>
find the first offer is the best, and that he will
never lose by accepting it: to refuse it, is but
pushing the debtor to extremities, and running
out some of the effects to secure the rest.</P>
<P>FIRST, as to collecting in the debts: supposing
the man is honest, and they can trust him, 'tis
evident no man can make so much of them as
the bankrupt. (1.) He knows the circumstances
of the debtors, and how best to manage them;
he knows who he may best push at, and who
best forbear. (2.) He can do it with the least
charge; the commissioners or assignees must
employ other people, such as attorneys, solli∣citors,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and they are paid dear; the bank∣rupt
sits at home, and by letters into the coun∣try,
<PB N="208" REF="227"/>
or by visiting them, if in town, can
make up every account, answer every objection,
judge of every scruple, and, in a word, with
ease, <HI>compared to what others must do,</HI> brings
them to comply.</P>
<P>NEXT, as to selling off a stock of goods;
the bankrupt keeps open the shop, disperses or
disposes of the goods with advantage; whereas
the commission brings all to a sale, or an out∣cry,
or an appraisement, and all finks the value
of the stock; so that the bankrupt can certain∣ly
make more of the stock than any other per∣son,
(always provided he is honest, as I said be∣fore,)
and much more than the creditors can
do.</P>
<P>FOR these reasons, and many others, the bank∣rupt
is able to make a better offer upon his e∣state
than the creditors can expect to raise any
other way; and therefore 'tis their interest al∣ways
to take the first offer, if they are satisfied
there is no fraud in it, and that the man has
offered any thing near the extent of what he
has left in the world to offer from.</P>
<P>IF then it be the tradesman's interest to ac∣cept
of the offer made, there needs no stronger
argument to be used with him for the doing it;
and nothing is more surprising <HI>to me</HI> than to
see tradesmen the hardest to come into such
compositions, and to push on severities against
other tradesmen, as if they were out of the
reach of the shocks of fortune themselves, or
that it was impossible for them ever to stand in
need of the same mercy; the contrary to which
I have often seen.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="228"/>
TO what purpose should tradesmen push things
to extremities against tradesmen, if nothing is
to be gotten by it, and if the insolvent trades∣man
will take proper measures to convince the
creditor that his intentions are honest? The law
was made for offenders; there needs no law for
innocent men: commissions are granted to ma∣nage
knaves, and hamper and entangle cunning
designing Rogues, who seek to raise fortunes out
of their creditors estates, and exalt themselves
by their own downfal; they are not design'd
against honest men, neither indeed is there any
need of them for such.</P>
<P>LET no man mistake this part therefore, and
think that I am moving tradesmen to be easy
and compassionate to Rogues and cheats; I am
far from it, and have given sufficient testimony
of the contrary; having, I assure you, been the
only person who actually form'd, drew up, and
first proposed that very clause to the House of
Commons, which made it felony to the bank∣rupt
to give in a false account. It cannot
therefore be suggested without manifest injustice,
that I would with one breath prompt creditors
to be easy to Rogues, and to cheating fraudu∣lent
bankrupts, and with another make a pro∣posal
to have them hang'd.</P>
<P>BUT I move the creditor on account of his
own interest, always to take the first offer, if he
sees no palpable fraud in it, or sees no reason
to suspect such fraud; and my reason is good,
<HI>viz.</HI> because I believe, <HI>as I said before,</HI> 'tis ge∣nerally
the best.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="229"/>
I know there is a new method of putting an
end to a tradesman's troubles, by that which
was formerly thought the greatest of all trou∣bles;
I mean, a fraudulent method, or what they
call taking our friendly statutes; that is, when
tradesmen get statutes taken out against them∣selves,
mov'd first by some person in kindness
to them, and done at the request of the bank∣rupt
himself; this is generally done when the
circumstances of the debtor are very low, and
he has little or nothing to surrender; and the
end is, that the creditors may be obliged to take
what there is, and the man may get a full dis∣charge.</P>
<P>THIS is indeed a vile corruption of a good
law, and turning the edge of the act against the
creditor, not against the debtor; and as he has
nothing to surrender, they get little or nothing,
and the man is as effectually discharged as if he
had paid twenty shillings in the pound; and
so he is in a condition to set up again, take
fresh credit, break again, and have another com∣mission
against him; and so round, as often as
he thinks fit. This indeed is a fraud upon the
act, and shews that all human wisdom is im∣perfect,
that the law wants some repairs, and
that it will in time come into consideration a∣gain,
to be made capable of disappointing the
people that intend to make such use of it.</P>
<P>I think there is also wanting a law against
twice breaking, and that all second commissions
should have some penalty upon the bankrupt,
and a third a farther penalty, and if the fourth
brought the man to the gallows, it could not
<PB N="211" REF="230"/>
be thought hard; for he that has set up and
broke, and set up again, and broke again, and
the like, a third time, I think merits to be hang'd,
if he pretends to venture any more.</P>
<P>MOST of those crimes against which any
laws are publish'd in particular, and which are
not capital, have generally an addition of pu∣nishment
upon a repetition of the crime; and
so on, a farther punishment to a farther repe∣tition;
I do not see why it should not be so
here; and I doubt not but it would have a
good effect upon tradesmen, to make them cau∣tious,
and to warn them to avoid such scan∣dalous
doings as we see daily practised, breaking
three or four, or five times over; and we see
instances of some such while I am writing this
very letter.</P>
<P>TO such therefore I am so far from moving
for any favour, either from the law, or from
their creditors, that I think the only deficiency
of the law at this time is, that it does not reach
to inflict a corporal punishment in such a case;
but leaves such insolvents to fare well in com∣mon
with those whose disasters are greater, and
who being honest and conscientious, merit more
favour, but do not often find it.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER. XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the unfortunate Tradesman compound∣ing
with his Creditors.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS is what in my last I called an <HI>al∣ternative</HI>
to that of the fortunate trades∣man
yielding to accept the composition
of his insolvent debtor.</P>
<P>THE poor unhappy tradesman having long la∣bour'd
in the fire, and finding it is in vain to
struggle, but that whether he strives or not strives,
he <HI>must break;</HI> that he does but go backward
more and more, and that the longer he holds
out, he shall have the less to offer, and be the
harder thought of, as well as the harder dealt
with; resolves to call his creditors together in
time, while there is something considerable to
offer them, and while he may have some just
account to give of himself, and of his conduct,
and that he may not be reproach'd with having
liv'd on the spoil, and consumed their estates;
and thus being satisfied that the longer he puts
the evil day from him, the heavier it will fall
when it comes; I say, he resolves to go no far∣ther,
and so gets a friend to discourse with and
prepare them, and then draws up a state of his
case to lay before them.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="232"/>
<HI>First,</HI> HE assures them that he has not wasted
his estate, either by vice and immorality, or by
expensive and riotous living, luxury, extrava∣gance,
<HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> HE makes it appear that he has met
with great losses, such as he could not avoid;
and yet such and so many, that he has not been
able to support the weight of them.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> THAT he could have stood it out
longer, but that he was sensible if he did he
should but diminish the stock, which, <HI>consider∣ing
his debts,</HI> was properly not his own; and
that he was resolved not to spend one part of
their debts, as he had lost the other.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> THAT he is willing to shew them
his books, and give up every farthing into their
hands, that they might see he acted the part of
an honest man to them. And,</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> THAT upon his doing so, they will
find, that there is in goods and good debts, suf∣ficient
to pay them fifteen shillings in the pound;
after which, and when he has made appear that
they have a faithful and just account of every
thing laid before them, he hopes they will give
him his liberty, that he may try to get his bread,
and to maintain his family in the best manner
he can; and if possible to pay the remainder of
the debt.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="233"/>
YOU see I go all the way upon the suggestion
of the poor unfortunate tradesman being criti∣cally
honest, and shewing himself so to the full
satisfaction of his creditors; that he shews them
distinctly a true state of his case, and offers his
books and vouchers to confirm every part of his
account.</P>
<P>UPON the suggestion of his being thus sin∣cerely
honest, and allowing that the state of
his account comes out so well as to pay fifteen
shillings in the pound, what and who but a par∣cel
of outrageous hot-headed men would reject
such a man? what would they be call'd, nay,
what would they say of themselves, if they
should reject such a composition, and should go
and take out a commission of bankrupt against
such a man? I never knew but one of the like
circumstances, that was refus'd by his creditors;
and that one held them out, till they were all
glad to accept of half what they said should be
first paid them: so may all those be served,
who reject such wholesome advice, and the sea∣son
for accepting a good offer, when it was
made them! But I return to the debtor.</P>
<P>WHEN he looks into his book, he finds him∣self
declin'd, his own fortune lost, and his cre∣ditors
stock in his hands wasted in part, and still
wasting, his trade being for want of stock much
fallen off, and his family expence and house-rent
great; so he draws up the general articles
thus:

<P>THIS account is drawn out to satisfy him∣self
how his condition stands, and what it is

and that being obliged to live in the same house,
for the sake of his business and warehouse, tho'
the rent is too great for him, his trade being
declin'd, his credit sunk, and his family be∣ing
large, he sees evidently he cannot go on,
and that it will only be bringing things from
bad to worse; and above all the rest being great∣ly
perplexed in his mind, that he is spending o∣ther

sufficient to pay all his creditors, tho' his debts

his warehouse should be fully worth the price
they cost, which being liable to daily contin∣gencies,
add to the reasons which press'd him

</TABLE></P>
<P>THIS amounts to fifteen shillings in the pound
upon all his debts; which if the creditors please
to appoint an assignee, or trustee to sell the
goods, and collect the debts, he is willing to
surrender wholly into their hands, hoping they
will as a favour give him his houshold-goods,
as in the account, for his family-use, and his-li∣berty,
that he may seek out for some employ∣ment
to get his bread.</P>
<P>THE account being thus clear, the books ex∣actly
agreeing, and the man appearing to have
acted openly and fairly, the creditors meet, and
after a few consultations agree to accept his pro∣posals,
and the man is a freeman immediately,
gets fresh credit, opens his shop again, and dou∣bling
his vigilance and application in business,
he recovers in a few years, grows rich; then
like an honest man still, he calls all his creditors
together again, tells them he does not call them
now to a second composition, but to tell them,
that having with God's blessing and his own in∣dustry
gotten enough to enable him, he was
resolv'd to pay them the remainder of his old
debt; and accordingly does so, to the great
joy of his creditors, to his own very great ho∣nour,
and to the encouragement of all honest
men to take the same measures: It is true, this
does not often happen, but there have been in∣stances
<PB N="219" REF="238"/>
of it, and I could name several within
my own knowledge.</P>
<P>BUT here comes an objection in the way, <HI>as
follows:</HI> It is true, this man did very honestly,
and his creditors had a great deal of reason to
be satisfied with his just dealing with them; but
is every man bound thus to strip himself naked?
perhaps this man at the same time had a family
to maintain, and had he no debt of justice to
them, but to beg his houshold-goods back of
them for his poor family, and that as an alms?
and would he not have fared as well, if he had
offer'd his creditors ten shillings in the pound,
and took all the rest upon himself? and then he
had reserv'd to himself sufficient to have support∣ed
himself in any new undertaking.</P>
<P>THE answer to this is short and plain, and
no debtor can be at a loss to know his way in
it; for otherwise people may make difficulties
where there are none; the observing the strict
rules of justice and honesty will chalk out his
way for him.</P>
<P>THE man being deficient in stock, and his e∣state
run out to a thousand pounds worse than
nothing, by his losses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 'tis evident all he has
left is the proper estate of his creditors, and he
has no right to one shilling of it; he owes it
them, 'tis a just debt to them, and he ought to
discharge it fairly, by giving up all into their
hands, or at least to offer to do so.</P>
<P>BUT to put the case upon a new foot; as he
is obliged to make an offer, as above, to put
all his effects, books, and goods into their power,
so he may add an alternative to them thus,
<PB N="220" REF="239"/>
<HI>viz.</HI> That if on the other hand they do not
think proper to take the trouble, or run the
risque of collecting the debts, and selling the
goods, which may be difficult; if they will
leave it to him to do it, he will undertake to
pay them—shillings in the pound, and stand
to the hazard both of debts and goods.</P>
<P>HAVING thus offer'd the creditors their choice,
if they accept the proposal of a certain sum, as
sometimes I know they have chosen to do, ra∣ther
than to have the trouble of making assignees,
and run the hazard of the debts, when put in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o
lawyer's hands to collect, and of the goods, to
fell them by appraisement; if I say they choose
this, and offer to discharge the debtor upon
payment, suppose it be of ten or twelve shil∣lings
in the pound in money, within a certain
time, or on giving security for the payment:
then indeed the debtor is discharged in consci∣ence,
and may lawfully and honestly take the
remainder, as a gift given him by his creditors
for undertaking their business, or securing the
remainder of their debt to them; I say, the
debtor may do this with the utmost satisfaction
to his conscience.</P>
<P>BUT without thus putting it into the credit∣ors
choice, 'tis a force upon them to offer them
any thing less than the utmost farthing that he
is able to pay; and particularly to pretend to
make an offer, as if it was his utmost, and, as is
usual, make protestations that it is the most he
is able to pay; (indeed every offer of<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a compo∣sition
is a kind of protestation that the debtor
is not able to pay any more) I say to offer thus,
<PB N="221" REF="240"/>
and declare he offers as much as possible, and
as much as the effects he has left will produce,
if his effects are able to produce more, he is then
a cheat; for he acts then like one that stands
at Bay with his creditors, makes an offer, and if
the creditors do not think fit to accept of it,
they must take what methods they think they
can take to get more: that is to say, he bids
open defiance to their statutes and commissions
of bankrupt, and any other proceedings; like a
town besieged, which offers to capitulate and
to yield upon such and such articles; which im∣plies,
that if those articles are not accepted, the
garrison will defend themslves to the last ex∣tremity,
and do all the mischief to the assail∣ants
that they can.</P>
<P>NOW this in a garrison-town, <HI>I say,</HI> may be
lawful and fair, but in a debtor to his creditor
it is quite another thing: for, <HI>as I have said
above,</HI> the debtor has no property in the effects
which he has in his hands; they are the goods
and estate of the creditor; and to hold out a∣gainst
the creditor, keep his estate by violence,
and make him accept of a small part of it, when
the debtor has a larger part in his power, and
is able to give it; this is not fair, much less is
it honest and conscientious: but 'tis still worse
to do this, and at the same time to declare that
it is the utmost the debtor can do; this, I say,
is still more dishonest, because it is not true,
and is adding falshood to the other injustice.</P>
<P>THUS I think I have stated the case clearly
for the conduct of the debtor; and indeed, this
way of laying all before the creditors, and put∣ting
<PB N="222" REF="241"/>
it into their choice seems a very happy me∣thod
for the comfort of the debtor, cast down
and dejected with the weight of his circumstan∣ces;
and, <HI>it may be,</HI> with the reproaches of his
own conscience <HI>too,</HI> that he has not done ho∣nestly
in running out the effects of his creditors,
and making other families suffer by him, and
<HI>perhaps poor families too;</HI> I say, this way of giv∣ing
up all with an honest and single desire to
make all the satisfaction he is able to his cre∣ditors,
greatly heals the breach in his peace,
which his circumstances had made before; for
by now doing all that is in his power, he makes
all possible amends for what is past, I mean as
to men; and they are induc'd by this open frank
usage to give him the reward of his honesty,
and freely forgive him the rest of the debt.</P>
<P>THERE is a manifest difference to the debtor
in point of conscience, between surrendring his
whole effects, or estate, to his creditors for sa∣tisfaction
of their debts, and offering them a
composition; unless, as I have said, the compo∣sition
is offer'd, as above, to the choice of the
creditor: By surrendring the whole estate, the
debtor acknowledges the creditors right to all
he has in his possession, and gives it up to them
as their own, putting it in their full power to
dispose of it as they please.</P>
<P>BUT by a composition the debtor, as <HI>I have
said above,</HI> stands at Bay with the creditors, and
keeping their estates in his hands, capitulates
with them, as it were, sword in hand, telling
them he can give them no more; when perhaps,
<HI>and too often it is the case,</HI> 'tis apparent that he
<PB N="223" REF="242"/>
is in condition to offer more. Now let the cre∣ditors
confent to these proposals, be what it
will, and however voluntary it may be pretend∣ed
to be, 'tis evident, that a force is the occa∣sion
of it, and the creditor complies, and ac∣cepts
the proposal, upon the supposition that no
better conditions can be had; 'tis the plain lan∣guage
of the thing; for no man accepts of less
than he thinks he can get; if he believ'd he
could have more, he would certainly get it if
he could.</P>
<P>AND if the debtor is able to pay one shilling
more than he offers, 'tis a cheat, a palpable
fraud, and of so much he actually robs his cre∣ditor;
but in a surrender the case is alter'd in
all its parts; the debtor says to his creditors,
Gentlemen, there is a full and faithful account
of all I have left; 'tis your own, <HI>and there it
is;</HI> I am ready to put it into your hands, or in∣to
the hands of whomsoever you shall appoint
to receive it, and to lie at your mercy: this is
all the man is able to do, and therefore is so
far honest, whether the methods that reduc'd
him were honest, or no; that's a question by
itself. If on this surrender he finds the credit∣ors
desirous, rather to have it digested into a
composition, and that they will voluntarily come
into such a proposal; then, as above, they be∣ing
judges of the equity of the composition, and
of what ability the debtor is to perform it; and
<HI>above all,</HI> of what he may or may not gain by
it; if they accept of such a composition, in∣stead
of the surrender of his effects, then the
case alters entirely, and the debtor is acquitted
<PB N="224" REF="243"/>
in conscience, because the creditor had a fair
choice, and the composition is rather their pro∣posal
to the debtor, than the debtor's proposal
to them.</P>
<P>THUS I think I have stated the case of justice
and conscience on the debtor's behalf, and clear'd
up his way, in case of a necessity, to stop tra∣ding,
that he may break without wounding his
conscience, as well as his fortunes; and he that
thinks fit to act thus, will come off with the
reputation of an honest man, and will have the
favour of his creditors to begin again, with
whatever he may have as to stock; and some∣times
that favour is better to him than a stock,
and has been the raising of many a broken trades∣man,
so that his latter end has been better than
his beginning.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Tradesmen ruining one another by
Rumour and Clamour, by Scandal and
Reproach.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Have dwelt long upon the tradesman's
management of himself, in order to
his due preserving both his business
and his reputation: let me bestow
one letter upon the tradesman for his conduct
among his neighbours and fellow-tradesmen.</P>
<P>CREDIT is so much a tradesman's blessing, that
'tis the choicest ware he deals in, and he cannot
be too chary of it when he has it, or buy it
too dear when he wants it; 'tis a stock to his
warehouse; 'tis current money in his cash-chest;
it accepts all his bills; for 'tis on the fund of
his credit that he has any bills to accept; de∣mands
would else be all made upon the spot,
and he must pay for his goods before he has
them; therefore I say it accepts all his bills, and
oftentimes pays them too: in a word, 'tis the
life and soul of his trade, and it requires his
utmost vigilance to preserve it.</P>
<P>IF then his own credit should be of so much
value to him, and he should be so nice in his
<PB N="226" REF="245"/>
concern about it, he ought in some degree to
have the same care of his neighbour's: Religion
teaches us not to slander and desame our neigh∣bour,
that is to say, not to raise or promote
any slander or scandal upon his good name: As
a good name is to another man, and which,
the Wiseman says, <HI>is better than life,</HI> the same
is credit to a tradesman; it is the life of his
trade; and he that wounds a tradesman's credit,
without cause, is as much a murtherer in trade,
as he that kills a man in the dark is a murtherer
in matters of blood.</P>
<P>BESIDES, there is a particular nicety in the
credit of a tradesman, which does not reach
in other cases: a man is slander'd in his chara∣cter,
or reputation, and 'tis injurious; and if it
comes in the way of a marriage, or of a pre∣ferment,
or post, it may disappoint and ruin
him; but if this happens to a tradesman, he is
immediately and unavoidably blasted, and un∣done:
a tradesman has but two sorts of enemies
to encounter with, <HI>viz.</HI> Thieves breaking open
his shop, and ill neighbours blackning and blast∣ing
his reputation; and the latter are the worst
Thieves of the two, by a great deal; and there∣fore
people should indeed be more chary of
their discourse of tradesmen, than of other men,
and that as they would not be guilty of mur∣ther.</P>
<P>I knew an author of a book, who was drawn
in unwarily, and without design, to publish a
scandalous story of a tradesman in <HI>London:</HI> He
(the author) was impos'd upon in it by a set of
men, who did it maliciously, and he was ut∣terly
<PB N="227" REF="246"/>
ignorant of the wicked design; nor did he
know the person, but rashly publish'd the thing,
being himself too fond of a piece of news,
which he thought would be grateful to his read∣ers:
nor yet did he publish the person's name,
so cautious he was; tho' that was not enough
as it prov'd; for the person was presently pub∣lish'd
by those who had maliciously done it.</P>
<P>THE scandal spread; the tradesman, a flou∣rishing
man, and a considerable dealer, was run
upon by it with a torrent of malice; a match
which he was about with a considerable fortune
was blasted and prevented, and that indeed was
the malicious end of the people that did it; nor
did it stop there; it brought his creditors upon
him, it ruin'd him, it brought out a commissi∣on
of bankrupt against him, it broke his heart,
and kill'd him; and after his death his debts and
effects coming in, there appear'd to be seven
shillings in the pound estate, clear and good over
and above all demands, all his debts discharg'd,
and all the expences of the statute paid.</P>
<P>IT was to no purpose that the man purg'd
himself of the crime laid to his charge; that
the author, who had ignorantly and rashly pub∣lish'd
the scandal, declar'd himself ignorant; the
man was run down by a torrent of reproach;
scandal oppress'd him; he was buried alive in
the noise and dust rais'd both against his morals
and his credit, and yet his character was prov'd
good, and his bottom in trade was so too, as I
have said above.</P>
<P>IT is not the least reason of my publishing
this to add, that even the person who was igno∣rantly
<PB N="228" REF="247"/>
made the instrument of publishing the
scandal, was not able to retrieve it, or to pre∣vent
the man's ruin by all the publick repara∣tion
he could make in print, and by all the ac∣knowledgment
he could make of his having
been ignorantly drawn in to do it. And this
I mention for the honest tradesman's caution,
and to put him in mind, that when he has un∣warily
let slip any thing to the wounding the
reputation of his neighbour tradesman, whether
in his trading credit, or the credit of his morals,
it may not be in his power to unsay it again;
<HI>that is,</HI> so as to prevent the ruin of the person;
and tho' it may grieve him as long as he lives,
as the like did the author I mention, yet 'tis
not in his power to recall it, or to heal the
wound he has given; and that he should consi∣der
very well of beforehand.</P>
<P>A tradesman's credit and a virgin's virtue, ought
to be equally sacred from the tongues of men;
and 'tis a very unhappy truth, that as times now
go, they are neither of them regarded among
us as they ought to be.</P>
<P>THE Tea-table among the Ladies, and the Cof∣fee-house
among the men, seem to be places
of new invention for a depravation of our
manners and morals; places devoted to scan∣dal,
and where the characters of all kinds of
persons and professions are handled in the most
merciless manner; where reproach triumphs,
and we seem to give our selves a loose to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all
upon one another in the most unchristian and
unfriendly manner in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="248"/>
IT seems a little hard that the reputation of
a young Lady, or of a new-married couple, or
of people in the most critical season of establish∣ing
the characters of their persons and families,
should lie at the mercy of the Tea-table: nor is
it less hard, that the credit of a tradesman,
which is the same thing in its nature as the
virtue of a Lady, should be tossed about, shuttle∣cock
like, from one table to another in the
coffee-house, till they shall talk all his creditors
about his ears, and bring him to the very mis∣fortune
which they reported him to be near;
when at the same time he ow'd them nothing
who rais'd the clamour, and ow'd nothing to all
the world, but what he was able to pay.</P>
<P>AND yet how many tradesmen have been thus
undone, and how many more have been put
to the full trial of their strength in trade, and
have stood by the mere force of their good cir∣cumstances?
whereas had they been unfurnish'd
with cash to have answered their whole debts,
they must have fallen with the rest.</P>
<P>WE need go no farther than <HI>Lombard-street</HI>
for an exemplification of this truth; there was
a time when <HI>Lombard-street</HI> was the only <HI>Bank,</HI>
and the goldsmith's there were all called Bankers;
the credit of their business was such, that the
like has not been seen in <HI>England</HI> since, in
private hands; some of those Bankers, as I have
had from their own mouths, have had near two
millions of paper credit upon them at a time;
that is to say, have had bills under their hands
running abroad for so much at a time.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="249"/>
ON a sudden, like a clap of thunder, King
<HI>Charles</HI> II. shut up the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> which was
the common center of the overplus cash these
great Bankers had in their hands; what was the
consequence? Not only the Bankers who had
the bulk of their cash there, but all <HI>Lombard-street</HI>
stood still; the very report of having mo∣ney
in the <HI>Exchequer</HI> brought a run upon the
goldsmiths that had no money there, as well as
upon those that had; and not only Sir <HI>Robert
Viner,</HI> Alderman <HI>Backwell, Farringdon, Forth</HI>
and others, broke and fail'd, but several were
ruin'd who had not a penny of money in the
<HI>Exchequer,</HI> and only sunk by the rumour of it;
that rumour bringing a run upon the whole street,
and giving a check to the paper credit that was
run up to such an exorbitant height.</P>
<P>I remember a shop-keeper who one time took
the liberty (<HI>foolish liberty!</HI>) with himself, in pub∣lick
company in a coffee-house, to say that <HI>he
was broke;</HI> I assure you, <HI>says he,</HI> that I am broke,
and to morrow I resolve to shut up my shop,
and call my creditors together. His meaning
was, that he had a brother just dead in his house,
and the next day was to be buried, when in
civility to the deceased, he kept his shop shut,
and several people whom he dealt with, and
ow'd money to, were the next day invited to
the funeral; so that he did actually shut up his
shop, and call some of his creditors together.</P>
<P>BUT he sorely repented the jest which he put
upon himself. Are you broke? says one of his
friends to him, that was in the coffee-house,
then I wish I had the little money you owe me;
<PB N="231" REF="250"/>
(which however, it seems, was not much;) says
the other, still carrying on his jest, I shall pay
no body, till, as I told you, I have called my
people together. The other did not reach his
jest, which at best was but a dull one, but he
reach'd that part of it that concern'd himself,
and seeing him continue carelesly sitting in the
shop, slipt out and fetch'd a couple of sergeants,
and arrested him. The other was a little sur∣priz'd;
but however, the debt being no great
sum, he paid it, and when he found his mis∣take
told his friends what he meant by his be∣ing
broke.</P>
<P>BUT it did not end there; for other people
of his neighbours who were then in the coffee-house,
and heard his discourse, and had thought
nothing more of it, yet in the morning seeing
his shop shut, concluded the thing was so in∣deed;
and immediately it went over the whole
street, that such a one was broke; from thence
it went to the <HI>Exchange,</HI> and from thence in∣to
the country, among all his dealers, who came
up in a throng and a fright to look after him;
In a word, he had as much to do to prevent
his breaking, as any man need to desire; and if
he had not had very good friends, as well as a
very good bottom, he had inevitably been ruin'd
and undone.</P>
<P>SO small a rumour will over-set a tradesman,
if he is not very careful of himself; and if a
word in jest from himself, which tho' indeed
no man that had considered things, or thought
before he spoke, would have said; (and on the
other hand, no man who had been wise and
<PB N="232" REF="251"/>
thinking would have taken as it was taken); I
say, if a word taken from the tradesman's own
mouth cou'd be so fatal, and run such a dan∣gerous
length, what may not words spoken sly∣ly,
and secretly, and maliciously, be made to
do?</P>
<P>A tradesman's reputation is of the nicest na∣ture
imaginable, like a blite upon a fine flower,
if it is but toucht, the beauty of it, or the fla∣vour
of it, or the seed of it is lost, tho' the
noxious breath which toucht it might not reach
to blast the leaf, or hurt the root; the credit of
a tradesman, at least in his beginning, is too
much at the mercy of every enemy he has, till
it has taken root, and is established on a solid
foundation of good conduct and success. 'Tis
a sad truth, that every idle tongue can blast a
young shop-keeper; and therefore, tho' I wou'd
not discourage any young beginner, yet it is
highly beneficial to alarm them, and to let them
know that they must expect a storm of scandal
and reproach upon the least slip they make: if
they but stumble, same will throw them down;
'tis true, if they recover, she will set them up
as fast; but malice generally runs before, and
bears down all with it; and there are ten trades∣men
who fall under the weight of slander and
an ill tongue, to one that is lifted up again by
the common hurry of report.</P>
<P>TO say I am broke, or in danger of break∣ing,
is to break me: and tho' sometimes the
malicious occasion is discovered, and the author
detected and exposed; yet how seldom is it so?
and how much oftner are ill reports rais'd to
<PB N="233" REF="252"/>
ruin and run down a tradesman, and the credit
of a shop? and like an arrow that flies in the
dark, it wounds unseen. The authors, no nor
the occasion of these reports, are never disco∣ver'd
perhaps, or so much as rightly guess'd at;
and the poor tradesman feels the wound, re∣ceives
the deadly blow, and is perhaps mortally
stabb'd in the vitals of his trade, I mean his
trading credit, and never knows who hurt him.</P>
<P>I must say, in the tradesman's behalf, that he
is in such a case to be esteemed a sacrifice to the
worst and most hellish of all secret crimes, I
mean envy; which is of the Devil, was born of
Hell, and is made up of every hateful vice, a
complication of crimes which nothing but the
worst of God's reasonable world can be guilty
of; and he will indeed merit and call for every
honest man's pity and concern; But what relief
is this to him? for in the mean time, tho' the
Devil himself were the raiser of the scandal,
nay, tho' a visible apparition from Hell it self
openly and avowedly carried the report about,
yet it shall go about; the blow shall take, and
every man, tho' at the same time expressing
their horror and aversion at the thing, shall yet
not be able, no not themselves, to say they re∣ceive
no impression from it.</P>
<P>THO' I know the clamour or rumour was rais∣ed
maliciously, and from a secret envy at the
prosperity of the man; yet if I deal with him,
it will in spite of all my abhorrence of the
thing, in spite of all my willingness to do jus∣tice,
I say it will have some little impression
upon me, it will be some shock to my confi∣dence
<PB N="234" REF="253"/>
in the man; and tho' I know the Devil is
a Liar, a Slanderer, a Calumniator, and that his
name <HI>Devil</HI> is derived from it; and that I knew,
<HI>if that,</HI> as I said, <HI>were possible,</HI> that the Devil in
his proper person rais'd and begun, and carried
on this scandal upon the tradesman, yet there
is a secret lurking doubt (about him), which
hangs about me concerning him; the Devil is a
Liar, but he may happen to speak truth just
then, he may chance to be right, and I know
not what there may be in it, and whether there
may be any thing or no, but I will have a little
care, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THUS insensibly and involuntarily, nay, in
spite of friendship, good wishes, and even re∣solution
to the contrary, 'tis almost impossible
to prevent our being shockt by rumour, and we
receive an impression whether we will or not,
and that from the worst enemy; there is such a
powerful sympathy between our thoughts and
our interest, that the first being but toucht, and
that in the lightest manner imaginable, we can∣not
help it, caution steps on in behalf of the
last, and the man is jealous and afraid, in spite
of all the kindest and best intentions in the
world.</P>
<P>NOR is it only dangerous in case of false ac∣cusations,
and false charges, for those indeed are
to be expected fatal; but even just and true
things may be as fatal as false, for the truth is
not always necessary to be said of a tradesman:
many things a tradesman may perhaps allow
himself to do, and may be lawfully done, but
if they should be known to be part of his cha∣racter,
<PB N="235" REF="254"/>
it would sink deep into his trading same,
his credit would suffer by it, and in the end it
might be his ruin; so that he that would not
set his hand to his neighbour's ruin, should as
carefully avoid speaking some truths, as raising
some forgeries upon him.</P>
<P>OF what fatal consequence then is the raising
rumours and suspicions upon the credit and
characters of young tradesmen? and how little
do those who are forward to raise such suspi∣cions,
and spread such rumours, consult con∣science,
or principle, or honour, in what they
do? how little do they consider that they are
committing a trading murther, and that, in re∣spect
to the justice of it, they may with much
more equity break open the tradesman's house,
and rob his cash-chest, or his shop? and what
they can carry away thence will not do him
half the injury that robbing his character of
what is due to it from an upright and diligent
conduct, would do: the loss of his money or
goods is easily made up, and may be sometimes
repaired with advantage; but the loss of credit
is never repair'd; the one is breaking open his
house, but the other is burning it down; the
one carries away some goods, but the other
shuts goods out from coming in; one is hurt∣ing
the tradesman, but the other is undoing
him.</P>
<P>CREDIT is the tradesman's life, 'tis, as the
Wiseman says, <HI>marrow to his bones;</HI> 'tis by this
that all his affairs go on prosperously and plea∣santly;
if this be hurt, wounded or weakened,
the tradesman is sick, hangs his head, is dejected
<PB N="236" REF="255"/>
and discouraged; and if he does go on, it is
heavily and with difficulty, as well as with dis∣advantage;
he is beholding to his fund of cash,
not his friends; and he may be truly said to
stand upon his own legs, for nothing else can
do it.</P>
<P>AND therefore, on the other hand, if such a
man is any way beholding to his credit, if he
stood before upon the foundation of his credit,
if he owes any thing considerable, 'tis a thou∣sand
to one but he sinks under the oppression
of it; that is to say, it brings every body upon
him; I mean, every one that has any demand
upon him; for in pushing for their own, espe∣cially
in such cases, men have so little mercy,
and are so universally persuaded that he that
comes first is first served, that I did not at all
wonder, that in the story of the tradesman who
so foolishly exposed himself in the coffee-house,
<HI>as above,</HI> his friend whom he said the words to,
began with him that very night, and before he
went out of the coffee-house; it was rather
a wonder to me he did not go out and bring
in half a dozen more upon him the same even∣ing.</P>
<P>IT is very rarely that men are wanting to
their own interest; and the jealousy of its be∣ing
but in danger, is enough to make men for∣get,
not friendship only, and generosity, but good
manners, civility, and even justice it self,
and fall upon the best friends they have in the
world, if they think they are in the least dan∣ger
of suffering by them.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="256"/>
ON these accounts it is, and many more, that
a tradesman walks in continual jeopardy, from
the loosness and inadvertency of mens tongues,
ay, and womens too; for tho' I am all along
very tender of the Ladies, and would do justice
to the sex, by telling you, they were not the
dangerous people whom I had in view in my first
writing upon this subject; yet I must be allow'd
to say, that they are sometimes fully even with
the men, for ill usage, when they please to fall
upon them in this nice article, in revenge for
any slight, or but pretended slight, put upon
them.</P>
<P>IT was a terrible revenge a certain Lady, who
was affronted by a tradesman in <HI>London,</HI> in a
matter of love, took upon him in this very ar∣ticle.
It seems a tradesman had courted her
some time, and it was become publick, as a
thing in a manner concluded, when the tradesman
left the Lady a little abruptly, without
giving a good reason for it; and indeed she af∣terwards
discovered that he had left her for the
offer of another with a little more money, and
that when he had done so, he reported that it
was for another reason, which reflected a little
on the person of the Lady: and in this the
tradesman did very unworthily indeed, and de∣serv'd
her resentment; but, as I said, it was a
terrible revenge she took, and what she ought
not to have done.</P>
<P>FIRST she found out who it was that her for∣mer
pretended lover had been recommended
to, and she found means to have it insinuated
to her by a woman-friend, that is to say, a she-Devil,
<PB N="238" REF="257"/>
that he was not only rakish and wicked,
but in short, that he had the Foul disease, and
went so far as to produce letters from him to
a Quack-Doctor, for directions to him how to
take his medicines, and afterwards a receipt for
money for the cure; tho' both the letters and
receipt also, as afterwards appear'd, were forg'd,
in which she went a dismal length in her re∣venge,
as you may see.</P>
<P>THEN she set two or three female instruments
to discourse her case in all their gossips com∣panies,
and at the Tea-tables where-ever they
came, and to magnify the Lady's prudence in
refusing such a man, and what an escape she had
had in being clear of him.</P>
<P>WHY, says a Lady to one of these emissaries,
what was the matter? I thought she was like to
be very well married.</P>
<P>O! no, Madam, by no means, <HI>says the Emis∣sary.</HI></P>
<P>WHY, Madam, <HI>says another Lady,</HI> we all
know Mr. <HI>H—,</HI> he is a very pretty sort
of a man.</P>
<P>AY, Madam, <HI>says the Emissary again,</HI> but you
know a pretty man is not all that's requir'd.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>says the Lady again,</HI> I don't mean so;
he's no beauty, no rarity that way; but I mean
a clever good sort of a man in his business,
such as we call a pretty tradesman.</P>
<P>AY, <HI>says the Lady employ'd,</HI> but that is not
all neither.</P>
<P>WHY, <HI>says the other Lady,</HI> he has a very
good trade too, and lives in good credit.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="258"/>
YES, <HI>says malice,</HI> he has some of the first, but
not too much of the last, I suppose.</P>
<P>NO! <HI>says the Lady,</HI> I thought his credit had
been very good.</P>
<P>IF it had, I suppose, <HI>says the first,</HI> the match
had not been broke off.</P>
<P>WHY, <HI>says the Lady,</HI> I understood it was
broken off on his side.</P>
<P>AND so did I, <HI>says another.</HI></P>
<P>AND so did I indeed, <HI>says a third.</HI></P>
<P>O! Madam, <HI>says the Tool,</HI> nothing like it, I
assure you.</P>
<P>INDEED, <HI>says another,</HI> I understood he had
quitted Mrs.—because she had not for∣tune
enough for him, and that he courted an∣other
certain Lady, whom we all know.</P>
<P>THEN the Ladies fell to talking of the cir∣cumstances
of his leaving her, and how he had
broken from her abruptly and unmannerly, and
had been too free with her character; at which
the first Lady, <HI>that is to say,</HI> the Emissary, or
Tool, as I call her, took it up a little warmly,
thus:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, you see, Ladies, how easily a
Lady's reputation may be injur'd; I hope you
will not go away with it so.</P>

<P>BUT indeed, Ladies, she is very much
injured in that story.</P>
</SP>

<SP>

<P>Nothing like it, Madam; but just the

</SP>
<SP>

<SP>

<P>I am very glad to hear it, for her

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can assure you, Madam, she has re∣fused
him, and that he knows well enough,
which has been one of the reasons that has
made him abuse her as he has done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>INDEED she has been used very ill by
him, or somebody for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>YES, he has reported strange things,
but they are all cursed lies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, but pray Madam what was the
reason, if we may be so free, that she turned
him off after she had entertained him so long?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! Madam, reason enough; I wonder
he should pretend, when he knew his own cir∣cumstances
too, to court a Lady of her for∣tune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHY are not his circumstances good
then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="241" REF="260"/>
<SPEAKER>1. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>NO, Madam, good! alas he has no
bottom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>NO bottom! why you surprise me;
we always look'd upon him to be a man of
substance, and that he was very well in the
world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's all a cheat, Madam, there's nothing
in it; when it came to be made out, nothing
at all in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>THAT cannot be, Madam; Mr.—has
liv'd always in good reputation and good cre∣dit
in his business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>IT'S all sunk again then, if it was so;
I don't know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHY did she entertain him so long
then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>ALAS, Madam! how could she know,
poor Lady, 'till her friends enquir'd into things;
but when they came to looke a little narrowly
into it, they soon found reason to give her a
caution, that he was not the man she took him
for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, 'tis very strange; I am sure he
past for another man among us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>IT must be formerly then; for they
tell me his credit has been sunk these three of
four years; he had need enough indeed to try
for a greater fortune, he wants it enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>'TIS a cursed thing when men look
out for fortunes to heal their trade-breaches
with, and make the poor wise patch up their
old bankrupt credit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>ESPECIALLY, Madam, when they know
themselves to be gone so far, that even with the
<PB N="242" REF="261"/>
addition they can stand but a little while, and
must inevitably bring the Lady to destruction with
them; I think such usage is worse than a ra∣vishment,
and merits the gallows as much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL I could never have thought
Mr.—was in such circumstances.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>NOR. I; we always took him for a ten
thousand pound man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>THEY say he was deep in the bubbles,
Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>NAY, if he was gotten into the <HI>South-Sea,</HI>
that might hurt him indeed, as it has done
many a gentleman of better estates than he.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know whether it was the <HI>South-Sea,</HI>
or some other bubbles, but he was very
near making a bubble of her, and 3000 <HI>l.</HI> into
the bargain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad she has escap'd him, if it be
so; 'tis a sign her friends took a great deal of
care of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>He won't hold it long; he will have
his desert, I hope; I don't doubt but we shall
see him in the Gazette quickly for a bankrupt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>IF he does not draw in some inno∣cent
young thing that has her fortune in her own

<SP>

<P>YOU astonish me! why I always thought
him a very civil, honest, sober man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>THIS is a sad world, Madam; men
are seldom known now, 'till 'tis too late; but
sometimes murther comes out seasonably, and
so I understand 'tis here; for the Lady had not
gone so far with him, but that she could go off
again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>NAY, 'twas time to go off again, if
'twas so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>NAY, Madam, I do not tell this part
of my own knowledge; I only heard so, but I
am afraid there is too much in it.</P>
</SP>
<P>THUS ended this piece of hellish wildfire, up∣on
the character and credit of a tradesman; the
truth of all which was no more than this, that
the tradesman disliking his first Lady left her,
and soon after, tho' not presently, courted an∣other
of a superior fortune indeed, <HI>tho' not
for that reason;</HI> and the first Lady, provok'd at
being cast off, and, as she call'd it, slighted,
rais'd all this clamour upon him, and persecuted
him with it, wherever she was able.</P>
<P>SUCH a discourse as this at a <HI>Tea-table,</HI> it
could not be expected, would be long a secret;
it ran from one tittle-tattle society to another;
and in every company, <HI>snow-ball like,</HI> it was far
from lessening, and it went on 'till at length it
began to meet with some contradiction, and the
tradesman found himself obliged to trace it as
far and as well as he could.</P>
<P>BUT it was to no purpose to confront it;
when one was ask'd, and another was ask'd,
<PB N="244" REF="263"/>
they only answer'd they heard so, and they heard
it in company in such a place, and in such a
place, and some could remember where they
had it, and some could not; and the poor trades∣man,
though he was really a man of substance,
sunk under it prodigiously: his new mistress,
whom he courted, refus'd him, and would ne∣ver
hear any thing in his favour, or trouble her∣self
to examine whether it was true, or no; it
was enough, she said, to her, that he was load∣en
with such a report; and if it was unjust she
was sorry for it, but the misfortune must be his,
and he must place it to the account of his hav∣ing
made some enemies, which she could not
help.</P>
<P>AS to his credit, the slander of the first La∣dy's
raising was spread industriously, and with
the utmost malice and bitterness, and did him
an inexpressible prejudice; every man he dealt
with was shy of him; every man he ow'd any
thing to, came for it; and, as he said, he was
sure he should see the last penny demanded;
It was his happiness that he had wherewith to
pay, for had his circumstances been in the least
perplexed, the man had been undone; nay, as
I have observ'd in another case, as his affairs might
have lain, he might have been able to have paid
forty shillings in the pound, and yet have been
undone, and been obliged to break, and shut up
his shop.</P>
<P>IT is true, he work'd thro' it, and he car∣ried
it so far, as to fix the malice of all the re∣ports
pretty much upon the first Lady; and par∣ticularly
so far, as to discover that she was the
<PB N="245" REF="264"/>
great reason of his being so positively rejected
by the other; but he could never fix it so upon
her, as to recover any damages of her, only to
expose her a little; and that she did not value,
having, <HI>as she said wickedly,</HI> had her full revenge
of him, and so indeed she had.</P>
<P>THE sum of the matter is, and it is for this
reason I tell you the story, that the reputation
of a tradesman is too much at the mercy of
mens tongues, <HI>or womens either;</HI> and a story rai∣sed
upon a tradesman, however malicious, how∣ever
false, and however friclous the occasion,
is not easily suppress'd, but if it touches his
credit, as a flash of fire it spreads over the whole
air like a sheet, there is no stopping it.</P>
<P>MY inference from all this shall be very brief;
if the tongues of every ill disposed envious gos∣sip,
whether man-gossip, or woman-gossip, for
there are of both sorts, may be thus mischiev∣ous
to the tradesman, and he is so much at the
mercy of the tattling slandering part of the
world; how much more should tradesmen be
cautious and wary, how they touch or wound the
credit and character of one another? there are
but a very few tradesmen who can say they are
out of the reach of slander, and that the malice
of enemies cannot hurt them with the tongue:
here and there one, and those antient and well-establish'd,
may be able to defy the world; but
there are so many others, that I think I may
warn all tradesmen against making havock of
one another's reputation, as they would be ten∣derly
us'd in the same case.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="265"/>
AND yet I cannot but say it is too much a
tradesman's crime, I mean, to speak slightly and
contemptibly of other tradesmen, their neigh∣bours,
or perhaps rivals in trade, and to run them
down in the characters they give of them, when
inquiry may be made of them, as often is the
case: The reputation of tradesmen is too often
put into the hands of their fellow-tradesmen,
when ignorant people think to inform them∣selves
of their circumstances, by going to those
whose interest it is to defame and run them
down.</P>
<P>I know no case in the world, in which there
is more occasion for the golden rule, <HI>quod tibi
fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris,</HI> do as you would
be done unto; and tho' you may be establish'd
as you may think, and be above the reach of
the tongues of others, yet the obligation of the
rule is the same, for you are to do as you would
be done unto, supposing that you were in the
same condition, or on a level with the person.</P>
<P>IT is confess'd, that tradesmen do not study
this rule in the particular case I am now speak∣ing
of: no men are apter to speak slightly and
coldly of a fellow-tradesman, than his fellow-tradesmen,
and to speak unjustly so too; the
reasons for which cannot be good, unless it
can be pleaded for upon the foundation of a
just and impartial concern in the interest of the
inquirer; and even then nothing must be said,
but what is consistent with strict justice and
truth; all that is more than that, is meer slander
and envy, and has nothing of the christian in
it, much less of the neighbour, or friend. It
<PB N="247" REF="266"/>
is true, that friendship may be due to the in∣quirer,
but still so much justice is due to the
person enquir'd of, that 'tis very hard to speak
in such cases, and not be guilty of raising dust,
as they call it, upon your neighbour, and at
least hurting, if not injuring him.</P>
<P>IT is indeed so difficult a thing, that I scarce
know what stated rule to lay down for the con∣duct
of a tradesman in this case; a tradesman
at a distance is going to deal with another
tradesman, my neighbour; and before he comes
to bargain, or before he cares to trust him, he
goes, <HI>weakly enough</HI> perhaps, to enquire of
him, and of his circumstances among his neigh∣bours
and fellow tradesmen, perhaps of the same
profession, or employment, and who among o∣ther
things, it may be, are concerned by their
interest, that this tradesman's credit should not
rise too fast: What must be done in this case?</P>
<P>IF I am the person enquir'd of, what must I
do? if I would have this man sink in his repu∣tation,
or be discredited, and if it is for my in∣terest
to have him cried down in the world, it
is a sore temptation to me to put in a few
words to his disadvantage; and yet if I do it
in gratification of my private views or interest,
o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon the foot of resentment of any kind
whatever, and let it be from what occasion it
will, nay, however just and reasonable the re∣sentment
is, or may be, it is utterly unjust and
unlawful, and is not only unfair as a man, but
unchristian, and is neither less or more than a
secret revenge, which is forbidden by the laws
of God and man.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="267"/>
IF on the other hand I give a good character
of the man, or of his reputation, I mean, of
his credit in business, in order to have the en∣quirer
trust him, and at the same time know
or believe that he is not a sound and good man,
(that is, as to trade, for it is his character in
trade that I am speaking of) what am I doing
then? 'tis plain I lay a snare for the enquirer,
and am at least instrumental to his loss, without
having really any design to hurt him; for 'tis
to be suppos'd, before he came to me to en∣quire,
I had no view of acting any thing to his
prejudice.</P>
<P>AGAIN, there's no medium; for to refuse or
decline giving a character of the man is down∣right
giving him the worst character I can; 'tis
in short shooting him thro' the head in his trade:
a man comes to me for a character of my neigh∣bouring
tradesman; I answer him with a re∣pulse
to his enquiry thus,</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>GOOD Sir, do not ask me the character of
my neighbours; I resolve to meddle with no
body's character; pray do not enquire of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, but Sir, you know the gentleman;
you live next door to him; you can tell me, if

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, Sir, I meddle with no man's
business; I will not give characters of my neigh∣bours;

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT I desire you to excuse me, for 'tis
what I never do; I cannot do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT, Sir, I am in a great streight; I am
just selling him a great parcel of goods, and I
am willing to sell them too, and yet I am wil∣ling
to be safe, as you would yourself, if you
were in my case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, Sir, I have always resolv'd to
forbear meddling with the characters of my
neighbours; 'tis an ill office; besides, I mind
my own business; I do not enter into the en∣quiries
after other peoples affairs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, Sir, I understand you then, I know
what I have to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHAT do you mean by that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>NOTHING, Sir, but what I suppose you
would have me understand by it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I WOULD have you understand what I say,
<HI>viz.</HI> that I will meddle with no body's business
but my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND I say I understand you; I know you
are a good man, and a man of charity, and
loth to do your neighbours any prejudice, and
<PB N="250" REF="269"/>
that you will speak the best of every man as
near as you can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you I speak neither the best or the
worst, I speak nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, Sir, that is to say, that as charity
directs you to speak well of every man, so when
you cannot speak well, you refrain, and will
say nothing; and you do very well to be sure,
you are a very kind neighbour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT that is a base construction of my
words; for I tell you I do the like by every
body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>YES, Sir, I believe you do, and I think
you are in the right of it, I am fully satisfied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU act more unjustly by me than by my
neighbour; for you take my silence, or declin∣ing
to give a character, to be giving an ill cha∣racter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>NO, Sir, not for an ill character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT I find you take it for a ground of
suspicion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I take it indeed for a due caution to me,
Sir; but the man may be a good man for all
that, only—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>ONLY what? I understand you; only
you won't trust him with your goods.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT another man may, Sir, for all that;
so that you have been kind to your neighbours
and to me too Sir; and you are very just; I
wish all men would act so one by another, I
should feel the benefit of it myself among o∣thers,
for I have suffer'd deeply by ill tongues,
I am sure.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="251" REF="270"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, however unjust you are to me,
and to my neighbour too, I will not undeceive
you at present; I think you do not deserve it.</P>
</SP>
<P>HE us'd a great many more words with him
to convince him, that he did not mean any
discredit to his neighbour tradesman; but it was
all one, he would have it be, that his declining
to give his said neighbour a good character was
giving him an ill character, which the other told
him was a wrong inference: however he found
that the man stood by his own notion of it,
and declin'd trusting the tradesman with the
goods, tho' he was satisfied he (the tradesman) was
a sufficient man.</P>
<P>UPON this he was a little uneasy, imagining
that he had been the cause of it, as indeed he
had, next to the positive humour of the enqui∣rer,
tho' it was not really his fault, neither was
the construction the other made of it just to his
intention; for he aim'd at freeing himself from
all enquiries of that nature, but found there was
no prevailing with him to understand it any o∣ther
way than he did; so to require the man a
little in his own way, he contriv'd the follow∣ing
method; he met with him two or three
days after, and ask'd him if he had sold his goods
to the person his neighbour.</P>
<P>NO, <HI>says he,</HI> you know I would not.</P>
<P>NAY, <HI>says the other,</HI> I only knew you said
so; I did not think you would have acted so
from what I said, nor do I think I gave you any
reason.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="271"/>
WHY, <HI>says he,</HI> I knew you would have given
him a good character if you could, and I knew
you were too honest to do it, if you were not
sure it was just.</P>
<P>THE last part I hope is true, but you might
have believ'd me honest too in what I did say,
that I had resolv'd to give no characters of any
body.</P>
<P>AS to that I took it, as any body would, to
be the best and modestest way of covering what
you would not have be disclos'd, namely, that
you could not speak as you would; and I also
judg'd, that you therefore chose to say no∣thing.</P>
<P>WELL, I can say no more but this; you are
not just to me in it, and I think you are not
just to yourself neither.</P>
<P>THEY parted again upon this, and the next
day the first tradesman, who had been so press'd
to give a character of his neighbour, sent a man
to buy the parcel of goods of the other trades∣man,
and offering him ready money, bought
them considerably cheaper than the neighbour-tradesman
was to have given for them, besides
reckoning a reasonable discount for the time,
which was four months, that the first tradesman
was to have given to his neighbour.</P>
<P>AS soon as he had done, he went and told
the neighbour tradesman what he had done, and
the reason of it, and sold the whole parcel to
him again, giving the same four months credit
for them, as the first man was to have given,
and taking the discount for time only to him∣self,
gave him all the advantage of the buying,
<PB N="253" REF="272"/>
and gave the first man the mortification of know∣ing
it all, and that the goods were not only for
the same man, but that the very tradesman,
whom he would not believe when he declin'd
giving a character of any man in general, had
trusted him with them.</P>
<P>HE pretended to be very angry, and to take
it very ill; but the other told him, that when
he came to him for a character of the man, and
he told him honestly, that he would give no
characters at all; that it was not for any ill to
his neighbour that he declin'd it; he ought to
have believ'd him; and that he hop'd when he
wanted a character of any of his neighbours a∣gain,
he would not come to him for it.</P>
<P>THIS story is to my purpose in this particu∣lar,
which is indeed very significant; that it
is the most difficult thing of its kind in the world
to avoid giving characters of our neighbouring
tradesmen; and that let your reasons for it be
what they will, to refuse giving a character is
giving a bad character, and is generally so tak∣en,
whatever caution or arguments you use to
the contrary.</P>
<P>IN the next place 'tis hard indeed, if an ho∣nest
neighbour be in danger of selling a large
parcel of goods to a fellow, who I may know
it is not likely should be able to pay for them,
tho' his credit may in the common appearance
be pretty good at that time; and what must I
do? if I discover the man's circumstances, which
perhaps I am let into by some accident, I say,
if I discover them, the man is undone; and if
I do not, the tradesman, who is in danger of
trusting him, is undone.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="273"/>
I confess the way is clear, if I am obliged to
speak at all in the case; the man unsound is
already a Bankrupt at bottom, and must fail;
but the other man is sound and firm, if this
disaster does not befall him; the first has no
wound given him, but negatively; he stands
where he stood before; whereas the other is
drawn in perhaps to his own ruin; in the next
place the first is a knave, or rather thief, for he
offers to buy, and knows he cannot pay; in a
word, he offers to cheat his neighbour; and if
I know it, I am so far confederate with him in
the cheat.</P>
<P>IN this case I think I am obliged to give the
honest man a due caution for his safety, if he
desires my advice; I cannot say I am obliged
officiously to go out of my way to do it, unless
I am any way interested in the person; for that
would be to dip into other mens affairs, which
is not my proper work; and if I should any
way be misinform'd of the circumstances of the
tradesman I am to speak of, and wrong him, I
may be instrumental to bring ruin causelesly
upon him.</P>
<P>IN a word, it is a very nice and critical case,
and a tradesman ought to be very sure of what
he says or does in such a case, the good or evil
fate of his neighbour lying much at stake, and
depending too much upon the breath of his
mouth: every part of this discourse shews how
much a tradesman's welfare depends upon the
justice and courtesy of his neighbours, and how
nice and critical a thing his reputation is.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="274"/>
THIS well consider'd would always keep a
tradesman humble, and shew him what need
he has to behave courteously and obligingly a∣mong
his neighbours; for one malicious word
from a man much meaner than himself, may
overthrow him in such a manner, as all the
friends he has may not be able to recover him;
a tradesman if possible should never make him∣self
any enemies.</P>
<P>BUT if it is so fatal a thing to tradesmen to
give characters of one another, and that a trades∣man
should be so backward in it for fear of
hurting his neighbour, and that, notwithstanding
the character given should be just, and the parti∣cular
reported of him should be true; with how
much greater caution should we act in like cases,
where what is suggested is really false in fact,
and the tradesman is innocent, as was the case
in the tradesman mentioned before about court∣ing
the Lady? if a tradesman may be ruin'd
and undone by a true report, much more may
he be so by a false report, by a malicious, slan∣dering,
defaming tongue: There is an artful
way of talking of other peoples reputation, which
really, however some people salve the matter, is
equal, if not superior, in malice to the worst
thing they can say; this is, by rendring them sus∣pected,
talking doubtfully of their characters,
and of their conduct, and rendring them first
doubtful, and then strongly suspected, I don't
know what to say to such a man. A Gentleman
came to me the other day, but I knew not what
to say, I dare not say he is a good man, or that
I would trust him with five hundred pound my
<PB N="256" REF="275"/>
self; if I should say so, I should bely my own
opinion; I do not know indeed, he may be a
good man at bottom, but I cannot say he minds
his business, if I should, I must lie, I think he
keeps a great deal of company, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>ANOTHER, he is ask'd of the currency of his
payments, and he answers suspiciously on that
side too; I know not what to say, he may pay
them at last, but he does not pay them the most
currently of any man in the street, and I have
heard saucy boys huff him at his door for bills on
his endeavouring to put them off; indeed I must
needs say I had a bill on him a few weeks ago
for an hundred pounds, and he paid me very
currently, and without any dunning, or often
calling upon, but it was I believe because I of∣fer'd
him a bargain at that time, and I suppos'd
he was resolv'd to put a good face upon his
credit.</P>
<P>A tradesman, <HI>that would do as he would be
done by,</HI> should carefully avoid these people who
come always about, enquiring after other trades∣mens
characters: There are men who make it
their business to do thus; and as they are there∣by
as ready to ruin and blow up good fair deal∣ing
tradesmen as others, so they do actually sur∣prise
many, and come at their characters earlier
and nearer than they expect they would.</P>
<P>TRADESMEN, <HI>I say,</HI> that will thus behave to
one another, cannot be suppos'd to be men of
much principle, but will be apt to lay hold of
any other advantage, how unjust soever, and
indeed will wait for an occasion of such advan∣tages;
and where is there a tradesman, but who,
<PB N="257" REF="276"/>
if he be never so circumspect, may some time
or other give his neighbour, who watches for
his halting, advantage enough against him: when
such a malicious tradesman appears in any place,
all the honest tradesmen about him ought to join
to expose him, whether they are afraid of him,
or no; they should <HI>blow him</HI> among the neigh∣bourhood,
as a publick nusance, as a common
Barrettor, or raiser of scandal; by such a gene∣ral
aversion to him they would depreciate him,
and bring him into so just a contempt, that no
body would keep him company, much less cre∣dit
any thing he said; and then his tongue would
be no slander, and his breath would be no blast;
and no body would either tell him any thing,
or hear any thing from him; and this kind of
usage, I think, is the only way to put a stop
to a defamer; for when he has no credit of
his own left, he would be unable to hurt any
of his neighbours.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Tradesman's entring into Partner∣ship
in Trade, and the many dangers
attending it.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE are some businesses which are
more particularly accustomed to part∣nerships
than others, and some that are
very seldom managed without two,
three, or four partners, and others that cannot
be at all carried on without partnership; and
there are others again, in which they seldom join
partners together.</P>
<P><HI>Mercers, Linen - Drapers; Banking Gold∣smiths,</HI>
and such considerable trades, are often,
and indeed generally carried on in partner∣ship,
but other meaner trades, and of less bu∣siness,
are carried on, generally speaking, single
handed.</P>
<P>SOME <HI>Merchants,</HI> who carry on great busi∣ness
in foreign ports, have what they call Houses
in those ports, where they plant and breed up
their sons and apprentices; and these are such
as I hinted could not carry on their business
without partnership.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="278"/>
THE trading in partnership is not only liable
to more hazards and difficulties, but it exposes
the tradesman to more snares and disadvantages
by a great deal, than the trading with a single
hand does; and some of those snares are these.</P>
<P>1. IF the partner is a stirring, diligent, ca∣pable
man, there is danger of his slipping into
the whole trade, and getting in between you
and home, by his application, thrusting you at
last quite out; so that you bring in a snake into
your chimney-corner, which, when it is warm'd
and grown vigorous, turns about at you, and
hisses you out of the house: It is with the trades∣man,
in the case of a diligent and active partner,
as I have already observ'd it was in the case of a
trusty and diligent apprentice; namely, that if
the master does not appear constantly at the
head of the business, and make himself be known
by his own application and diligence to be what
<HI>he is;</HI> he shall soon look to be what <HI>he is not,</HI>
that is to say, one not concern'd in the busi∣ness.</P>
<P>HE will never fail to be esteem'd the princi∣pal
person concern'd in the shop, and in the
trade, who is principally and most constantly
found there, acting at the head of every busi∣ness;
and be it a servant or a partner, the ma∣ster
or chief loses himself extremely by the ad∣vances
the other makes of that kind; for when∣ever
they part again, either the apprentice by
being out of his time, or the partner by the ex∣piration
of the articles of partnership, or by any
other determination of their agreement, the
customers most certainly desire to deal with the
<PB N="260" REF="279"/>
man whom they have so often been obliged by;
and if they miss him, enquire after and follow
him.</P>
<P>IT is true, the apprentice is the more danger∣ous
of the two, because his separation is sup∣posed
to be more certain, and generally soon∣er
than the partner; the apprentice is not known,
and cannot have made his interest among the
buyers, but for perhaps a year, or a year and a
half before his time expir'd; sooner than that
he could not put himself in the way of being
known and observ'd; and then, when his time
is out, he certainly removes, unless he is taken
into the shop as a Partner, and that indeed pro∣longs
the time, and places the injury at a
greater distance, but still it makes it the more
influencing when it comes; and unless he is
brought some how or other into the family,
and becomes one of the house, perhaps by mar∣riage,
or some other settled union with the ma∣ster,
he never goes off without making a great
chasm in the master's affairs, and the more, by
how much he has been more diligent and use∣ful
in the trade, the wounds of which the ma∣ster
seldom if ever recovers.</P>
<P>IF the partner was not an apprentice, but that
they either came out of their times together,
or near it, or had a shop and business before,
but quitted it to come in, it may then be said
that he brought part of the trade with him,
and so encreas'd the trade when he join'd with
the other in proportion to what he may be said
to carry away when he went off; this is the best
thing that can be said of a partnership; and
<PB N="261" REF="280"/>
then I have this to add, first, that the tradesman
who took the Partner in, has a fair field indeed
to act in with his Partner, and must take care,
by his constant attendance, due acquaintance
with the customers, and appearing in every part
of the business, to maintain not his interest
only, but the appearance of his interest in the
shop or warehouse, that he may on every oc∣casion,
and to every customer, not only be, but
be known to be, the master and head of the
business; and that the other is at best but a
Partner, and not a chief Partner, as in case of
his absence and negligence will presently be
suggested; for he that chiefly appears will be al∣ways
chief Partner in the eye of the customers,
whatever he is in the substance of the thing.</P>
<P>THIS indeed is much the same case with what
is said before of a diligent servant, and a neg∣ligent
master, and therefore I forbear to enlarge
upon it; but it is so important in both cases,
that indeed it cannot well be mentioned too
often: the master's full application, in his own
person, is the only answer to both. He that
takes a partner only to ease him of the toil of
his business, that he may take his pleasure, and
leave the drudgery, as they call it, to the Part∣ner,
should take care not to do it till about
seven years before he resolves to leave off trade;
that at the end of the partnership he may be
satisfied to give up the trade to his Partner, or
see him run away with it, and not trouble him∣self
about it.</P>
<P>BUT if he takes a partner at his beginning,
with an intent, by their joint enlarged stock,
<PB N="262" REF="281"/>
to enlarge their business, and so carry on a ca∣pital
trade, which perhaps neither of them were
able to do by themselves, and which is the on∣ly
justifiable reason for taking a partner at all,
he must resolve then to join with his Partner,
not only in stock, but in mutual diligence and
application, that the trade may flourish by their
joint assistance and constant labour, as two oxen
yoak'd together in the same draught, by their
joint assistance, draw much more than double
what they could either of them draw by their
single strength; and this indeed is the only safe
circumstance of a partnership; then indeed they
are properly partners when they are assistants to
one another; whereas otherwise they are like
two gamesters striving to worm one another
out, and to get the mastery in the play they
are engaged in.</P>
<P>THE very word <HI>Partner,</HI> imports the substance
of the thing, and they are as such engaged to a
mutual application, or they are no more <HI>Part∣ners,</HI>
but rather one is the trading gentleman,
and the other is the trading drudge; but even
then let them depend, the drudge will carry a∣way
the trade and the profit too at last; and
this is the way how one partner may honestly
ruin another, and for ought I know 'tis the on∣ly
one; for it cannot be said but that the dili∣gent
Partner acts honestly in acting diligently,
and if the other did the same they would both
thrive alike; but if one is negligent and the
other diligent, one extravagant and expensive,
the other frugal and prudent, it cannot be said
to be his fault, that one is rich, and the other
<PB N="263" REF="282"/>
poor; that one encreases in the stock, and the
other is lessen'd, and at last work'd quite out
of it.</P>
<P>AS a Partner then is taken in only for case,
to abate the first tradesman's diligence, and take
off the edge of his application, so far a Partner,
let him be as honest and diligent as he will, is
dangerous to the tradesman; nay, the more ho∣nest
and the more diligent he is, the more dan∣gerous
he is, and the more a snare to the trades∣man
that takes him in: and a tradesman ought
to be very cautious in the adventure, for indeed
it is an adventure, That he be not brought
in time to relax his diligence, by having a part∣ner,
even contrary to his first intention; for
laziness is a subtle insinuating thing, and 'tis a
sore temptation to a man of ease and indolence,
to see his work done for him, and less need of
him in the business than used to be, and yet
the business to go on well too; and this danger
is dormant, and lies unseen, till after several
years, it rises as it were out of its ambuscade,
and surprizes the tradesman, letting him see by
his loss what his neglect has cost him.</P>
<P>2. BUT there are other dangers in partner∣ship,
and those not a few; for you may not
only be remiss and negligent, remitting the
weight of the business upon him, and depend∣ing
upon him for its being carried on, by which
he makes himself master, and brings you to be
forgot in the business: But he may be crafty
too, and designing in all this, and when he has
thus brought you to be as it were <HI>no body,</HI> he
shall make himself be all <HI>some body</HI> in the trade,
<PB N="264" REF="283"/>
and in that particular he by degrees gets the
capital interest, as well as stock in the trade,
while the true original of the shop, who laid
the foundation of the whole business, brought
a trade to the shop, or brought commissions to
the house, and whose the business more parti∣cularly
is, is secretly supplanted, and with the
concurrence of his own negligence, for without
that it cannot be, is as it were laid aside, and at
last quite thrust out.</P>
<P>THUS whether honest or dishonest, the tradesman
is circumvented, and the partnership is
made fatal to him; for it was all owing to the
partnership, the tradesman was diligent before,
understood his business, and kept close to it,
gave up his time to it, and by employing him∣self,
prevented the indolence which he finds
breaking insensibly upon him afterwards, by
being made easy, as <HI>they call it,</HI> in the assistance
of a partner.</P>
<P>5. BUT there are abundance of other cases
which make a partnership dangerous; for if it
be so where the partner is honest and diligent,
and where he works into the heart of the bu∣siness
by his industry and application, or by his
craft and insinuation, what may it not be if he
proves idle and extravagant; and if instead of
working him out, he may be said to play him
out of the business; that is to say, prove wild,
expensive, and run himself and his partner out
by his extravagance?</P>
<P>THERE are but too many examples of this
kind; and here the honest tradesman has the
labouring oar indeed! for instead of being as∣sisted
<PB N="265" REF="284"/>
by a diligent industrious Partner, who on
that account he took into the trade; he proves
a loose, extravagant, wild fellow, runs abroad
into company, and leaves him (for whose relief
he was taken) in to bear the burden of the
whole trade, which perhaps was too heavy for
him before, and if it had not been so, he had
not been prevail'd with to have taken in a Part∣ner
at all.</P>
<P>THIS is indeed a terrible disappointment, and
is very discouraging; and the more so, because
it cannot be recall'd; for a partnership is like
matrimony, it is almost engaged in for better
for worse, till the years expire; there is no
breaking it off, at least not easily nor fairly,
but all the inconveniences which are to be fear'd
will follow and stare in your face: as first, the
partner in the first place draws out all his stock;
and this sometimes is a blow fatal enough, for
perhaps the partner cannot take the whole trade
upon himself, and cannot carry on the trade
upon his own stock, if he could, he would not
have taken in a partner at all; this withdrawing
the stock has sometimes been very dangerous
to a partner; nay, has many times been the o∣verthrow
and undoing of him and of the fami∣ly
that is left.</P>
<P>HE that takes a Partner into his trade on this
account, namely, for the support of his stock, to
enjoy the assistance of so much cash to carry on
the trade, ought seriously to consider what he
shall be able to do when the partner breaking
off the partnership shall carry all his stock, and
the improvement of it too, with him; perhaps
<PB N="266" REF="285"/>
the tradesman's stock is not much increased,
perhaps not at all; nay, perhaps the stock is
lessened, instead of being increased, and they
have rather gone backward than forward; what
shall the tradesman do in such a case? and how
shall he bear the breach in his stock which that
separation would make?</P>
<P>THUS he is either tied down to the Partner,
or the partner is pin'd down to him, for he
cannot separate without a breach. It is a sad
truth to many a partner, that when the part∣nership
comes to be finished and expired, the
man would let his partner go, but the other
cannot go without tearing him all to pieces
whom he leaves behind him; and yet the part∣ner
being loose, idle, and extravagant, in a word,
will ruin both if he stays.</P>
<P>THIS is the danger of partnership in some of
the best circumstances of it; but how hazard∣ous
and how fatal is it in other cases? and how
many an honest and industrious tradesman has
been prevail'd with to take in a partner to ease
himself in the weight of the business, or on se∣veral
other accounts, some perhaps reasonable
and prudent enough, but has found himself
immediately involv'd in a sea of trouble, is
brought into innumerable difficulties, conceal'd
debts, and unknown incumbrances, such as he
could no ways extricate himself out of, and so
both have been unavoidably ruin'd together?</P>
<P>THESE cases are so various and so uncertain,
that it is not easy to enumerate them; but we
may include the particulars in a general or two.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="286"/>
1. ONE partner may contract debts, even in
the partnership it self, so far unknown to the
other, as that the other may be involv'd in the
danger of them, tho' he was not at all concern'd
in, or acquainted with them at the time they
were contracted.</P>
<P>2. ONE partner may discharge debts for both
partners, and so having a design to be knavish,
may go and receive money and give receipts
for it, and not bringing it to account, or not
bringing the money into cash, may wrong the
stock to so considerable a sum, as may be to the
ruin of the other partner.</P>
<P>3. ONE partner may confess judgment, or
give bonds, or current notes in the name, and
as for the account of the company, and yet con∣vert
the effects to his own private use, leaving
the stock to be answerable for the value.</P>
<P>4. ONE partner may sell and give credit, and
deliver parcels of goods to what sum, or what
quantity he thinks fit, and to whom, and so by
his indiscretion, or perhaps by connivance and
knavery, lose to the stock what parcel of goods
he pleases, to the ruin of the other partner,
and bring themselves to be both bankrupt to∣gether.</P>
<P>5. NAY, to sum up all, one partner may com∣mit
acts of bankrupcy without the knowledge
of the other, and thereby subject the united
stock, and both or all the partners to the dan∣ger
of a commission, when they may themselves
know nothing of it till the blow is given, and
given so, as to be too late to be retrieved.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="287"/>
ALL these and many more being the ill con∣sequences
and dangers of partnership in trade,
I cannot but seriously warn the honest industri∣ous
tradesman, if possible, to stand upon his
own legs, and go on upon his own bottom;
to pursue his business diligently, but cautiously,
and what we call fair and softly; not eagerly
pushing to drive a vast trade, and enjoy but
half of it, rather carry on a middling business,
and let it be his own.</P>
<P>THERE may be cases indeed which may have
their exceptions to this general head of advice;
partnerships may sometimes prove successful, and
in some particular business they are more ne∣cessary
than in others, and in some they tell us
that they are absolutely necessary; tho' the last
I can by no means grant; but <HI>be that as it will,</HI>
there are so many cases more in number, and
of great consequence too, which miscarry by
the several perplex'd circumstances, differing
tempers, and open knavery of partners, that I
cannot but give it as a friendly advice to all
tradesmen, if possible to avoid partnerships of
all kinds.</P>
<P>BUT if the circumstances of trade require part∣nerships,
and the risque must be run, I would
recommend to the tradesman not to enter into
partnerships, but under the following circum∣stances.</P>
<P>1. NOT to take in any partner who should
be allowed to carry on any separate business,
in which the partnership is not concerned; de∣pend
upon it, whatever other business your
partner carries on, you run the risque of it as
<PB N="269" REF="288"/>
much as you do of your own; and you run the
risque with this particular circumstance too, that
you have the hazard without the profit or suc∣cess;
that is, without a share in the profit and
success, which is very unequal and unfair. I
know cunning men will tell you that there may
be provision made so effectually in the articles
of partnership, that the stock in partnership
should be concerned in no other interest or
engagements but its own; but let such cunning
gentlemen tell me, if the partner meets with a
disappointment in his other undertakings, which
wounds him so deep as to break him, will it
not affect the partnership thus far? 1. That it
may cause his stock to be drawn hastily out, and
perhaps violently too. 2. That it touches and
taints the credit of the partner to be concern'd
with such a man; and tho' a man's bottom may
support him, if it be very good, yet 'tis a blow
to him, touches his credit, and makes the world
stand a little at a stay about him, if it be no
more, for a while, till they see that he shews
himself upon the <HI>Exchange,</HI> or at his shop-door
again, in spight of all the apprehensions and
doubts that have been handed about concerning
him. Either of these are so essential to the
tradesman whose partner thus sinks by his own
private breaches, in which the partnership is
not concern'd, that it is worth while to caution
the tradesman against venturing. And I must
add too, that many a tradesman has fallen un∣der
the disaster by the partner's affairs thus af∣fecting
him, tho' the immediate losses which
the partner hath suffer'd have not been charg'd
<PB N="270" REF="289"/>
upon him; and yet I believe 'tis not so easy to
avoid being fallen upon for those debts also.</P>
<P>IT is certain, as I formerly noted, rumour
will break a tradesman almost at any time; it
matters not at first, whether the rumour be true,
or false; what rumour can sit closer to a man
in business, his own personal misfortunes ex∣cepted,
than such as this, <HI>That his Partner is
broke?</HI> That his Partner has met with a loss,
suppose an Ensurance, suppose a fall of stocks,
suppose a bubble or a cheat, or we know not
what, the partner is sunk, no man knows whe∣ther
the partnership be concern'd in it, or no;
and while it is not known, every man will sup∣pose
it, for mankind always think the worst of
every thing.</P>
<P>WHAT can be a closer stroke at the poor
tradesman? He knows not what his partner has
done; he has reason to fear the worst; he even
knows not himself for a while, whether he
can steer clear of the rocks, or no; but soon
recovers, knows his own circumstances, and
struggles hard with the world; pays out his part∣ner's
stock, and gets happily over it; and 'tis well
he does so, for that he is at the brink of ruin
must be granted; and where one stands and
keeps up his reputation and his business, there
are twenty would be undone in the same cir∣cumstances.</P>
<P>WHO then would run the venture of a Part∣ner,
if it were possible to avoid it? and who,
if they must have a Partner, would have one
that was concern'd in separate business, in which
the partnership was not engaged?</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="290"/>
2. IF you must have a Partner, always choose
to have the partner rather under than over
you; by this I mean, take him in for a fifth,
a fourth, or at most a third; never for a half:
there are many reasons to be given for this, be∣sides
that of having the greater share of profits,
<HI>for that I do not give as a reason here at all;</HI>
but the principal reasons are these; first, in case
of any disaster in any of the particular supposed
accidents, which I have mention'd, and that you
should be obliged to pay out your partner's stock,
it will not be so heavy, or be so much a blow
to you; and secondly, you preserve to yourself
the governing influence in your own business;
you cannot be over-rul'd, over-aw'd, or dogma∣tically
told, it shall, or shall not be thus, or thus:
He that takes in a partner for a third has a <HI>part∣ner
Servant;</HI> he that takes him in for a half
has a <HI>partner Master;</HI> that is to say, a Director,
or Preceptor: let your Partner have always a
lesser interest in the business than yourself, and
be rather less acquainted with the business than
yourself, at least not better; you should rather
have a partner to be instructed, than a partner
to instruct you; for he that teaches you will
always taunt you.</P>
<P>3. IF you must have a partner, let him al∣ways
be your <HI>junior</HI> rather than your senior;
by this I mean, your junior in the business, whe∣ther
he is so in years, or not: There are many
reasons why the tradesman should choose this,
and particularly the same as the other of taking
him in for a junior or inferior part of the trade;
<HI>that is to say,</HI> to maintain the superiority of
<PB N="272" REF="291"/>
the business in his own hands; and this I men∣tion,
not at all upon account of the pride or
vanity of the superiority, for that is a trifle com∣par'd
to the rest; but that he may have the more
authority to inspect the conduct of his Partner,
in which he is so much and so essentially con∣cerned;
and to enquire whether he is doing any
thing, or taking any measures dangerous or pre∣judicial
to the stock, or to the credit of the
partnership, that so if he finds any thing, he
may restrain him, and prevent in time the mis∣chief
which would otherwise be inevitable to them both.</P>
<P>THERE are many other advantages to a trades∣man,
who is oblig'd to take a partner, by keep∣ing
in his own hands the major part of the
trade, which are too long to repeat here; such
as his being always able to put a check to any
rash adventure, any launching out into Bubbles
and Projects, and things dangerous to the busi∣ness;
and this is a very needful thing in a part∣nership,
that one partner should be able to cor∣rect
the rash resolves of another in hazardous
cases.</P>
<P>BY this correcting of rash measures, I mean
over-ruling them with moderation and temper,
for the good of the whole, and for their mu∣tual
advantage: The <HI>Romans</HI> frequently had two
Generals, <HI>or Consuls,</HI> to command their armies
in the field; one of which was to be a young
man, that by his vigour and sprightly forward∣ness
he might keep up the spirits and courage
of the soldiers, encourage them to fight, and
lead them on by his example; the other an old
<PB N="273" REF="292"/>
soldier, that by his experience in the military
affairs, age and councils, he might a little abate
the fire of his collegue, and might not only
know how to fight, but know when to fight;
that is to say, when to avoid fighting; and the
want of this lost them many a victory, and the
great battle of <HI>Cannae</HI> in particular, in which
80000 <HI>Romans</HI> were killed in one day.</P>
<P>TO compare small things with great, I may
say it is just so in the affair of trade; you
should always join a sober grave head, weighed
to business, and acquainted with trade, to the
young trader, who having been young in the
work will the easier give up his judgment to
the other, and who is governed with the solid
experience of the other; and so you join their
ways together, the rash and the sedate, the
grave and the giddy.</P>
<P>AGAIN, if you must go into partnership, be
sure, if possible, you take no body into partner∣ship
but such as whose circumstances in trade
you are fully acquainted with; such there are
frequently to be had among relations and neigh∣bours,
and such, if possible, should be the man
that is taken into partnership, that the hazard
of unsound circumstances may be avoided; a
man may else be taken into partnership who
may be really Bankrupt even before you take
him in; and such things have been done, to the
ruin of many an honest tradesman.</P>
<P>IF possible, let your Partner be a beginner,
that his stock may be reasonably suppos'd to be
free and unentangled; and let him be one that
you know personally, and his circumstances,
<PB N="274" REF="293"/>
and did know even before you had any thoughts
of engaging together.</P>
<P>ALL these cautions are with a supposition
that the Partner <HI>must</HI> be had; but I must still
give it as my opinion, in the case of such trades∣men
as I have all along directed my self to,
that if possible they should go on single handed
in trade; and I close it with this brief note,
respecting the qualifications of a Partner, <HI>as a∣bove,</HI>
that</P>
<P>Next to <HI>no</HI> Partner, <HI>such a</HI> Partner is best.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Honesty in Dealing; and (1.) Of tel∣ling
unavoidable Trading Lies.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE is some difference between an
<HI>honest man,</HI> and an <HI>honest tradesman;</HI>
and tho' the distinction is very nice, yet
I must say it is to be supported: Trade cannot
make a knave an honest man, for there is a
specifick difference between honesty and knave∣ry,
which can never be altered by trade or any
other thing; nor can that integrity of mind
which describes and is peculiar to a man of ho∣nesty
<PB N="275" REF="294"/>
be ever abated to a tradesman; the recti∣tude
of his soul must be the same, and he must
not only intend or mean honestly and justly,
but he must do so; he must act honestly and
justly, and that in all his dealings; he must nei∣ther
cheat or defraud, over-reach or circumvent
his neighbour, or indeed any body he deals with;
nor must he design to do so, or lay any plots
or snares to that purpose in his dealing, as is
frequent in the general conduct of too many,
who yet call themselves <HI>honest</HI> tradesmen, and
would take it very ill to have any one tax their
integrity.</P>
<P>BUT after all this is premis'd, there are some
latitudes, like poetical licences in other cases,
which a tradesman is and mail be allow'd, and
which by the custom and usage of trade he may
give himself a liberty in, which cannot be al∣low'd
in other cases to any man, no, nor to
the tradesman himself out of his business; I
say, he may take some liberties, <HI>but within
bounds;</HI> and whatever some pretenders to strict
living may say, yet <HI>that tradesman</HI> shall pass
with me for a very honest man, notwithstand∣ing
the liberty which he gives himself of this
kind, if he does not take those liberties in an
exorbitant manner; and those liberties are such
as these.</P>
<P>1. THE liberty of asking more than he will
take. I know some people have condemned
this practice as dishonest, and the <HI>Quakers</HI> for
a time, stood to their point in the contrary pra∣ctice,
resolving to ask no more than they would
take, upon any occasion whatsoever, and choosing
<PB N="276" REF="295"/>
rather to lose the selling, of their goods, <HI>though
they could afford sometimes to take what was
offer'd,</HI> rather than abate a farthing of the price
they had ask'd; but time and the necessities of
trade made them wiser, and brought them off
of that severity, and they by degrees came to
ask, and abate, and abate again, just as other
honest tradesmen do, though not perhaps as
some do, who give themselves a fuller liberty
that way.</P>
<P>INDEED it is the buyers that make this custom
necessary; for they, <HI>especially those who buy for
immediate use,</HI> will <HI>first</HI> pretend positively to tie
themselves up to a limited price, and bid them
a little and a little more, 'till they come so near
the sellers price, that they, <HI>the sellers,</HI> cannot
find in their hearts to refuse it, and then they
are tempted to take it, notwithstanding their
first words to the contrary: It is common in∣deed
for the tradesman to say, <HI>I cannot abate
any thing,</HI> when yet they do and can afford it;
but the tradesman should indeed not be under∣stood
strictly and literally to his words, but as
he means it, <HI>viz.</HI> that he cannot reasonably a∣bate,
and that he cannot afford to abate; and
there he may be in earnest, <HI>viz.</HI> that he cannot make
a reasonable profit of his goods, if he is obliged
to abate, and so the meaning is honest, that
he cannot abate; and yet rather than not take
your money, he may at last resolve to do it, in
hopes of getting a better price for the remain∣der,
or being willing to abate his ordinary gain,
rather than disobligc, the customeer; or being
perhaps afraid he should not sell off the quan∣tity;
<PB N="277" REF="296"/>
and many such reasons may be given, why
he submits to fell at a lower price than he re∣ally
intended, or can afford to do; and yet he
cannot be said to be dishonest, or to lie, in
saying at first he cannot, or could not abate.</P>
<P>A man in trade is properly to be said not to
be able to do, what he cannot do to his profit
and advantage; the <HI>English</HI> cannot trade to
<HI>Hungary,</HI> and into <HI>Sclavonia;</HI> that is to say,
they cannot do it to advantage; but 'tis better
for them to trade to <HI>Venice</HI> with their goods,
and let the <HI>Venetians</HI> carry on a trade into <HI>Hun∣gary</HI>
thro' <HI>Dalmatia, Croatia, &amp;c.</HI> and the like in
other places.</P>
<P>TO bring it down to particular cases; one
certain merchant cannot deal in one sort of
goods, which another merchant is eminent for;
the other merchant is as free to the trade as he,
but he cannot do it to profit; for he is unac∣quainted
with the trade, and 'tis out of his way,
and therefore he cannot do it.</P>
<P>THUS to the case in hand; the tradesman
says, he cannot sell his goods under such a price,
which in the sense of his business is true; that
is to say, he cannot do if to carry on his trade
with the usual and reasonable advantage which
he ought to expect, and which others make in
the same way of business.</P>
<P>OR he cannot without underselling the mar∣ket,
and undervaluing the goods, and seeming
to undersell his neighbour shop-keepers, to
whom there is a justice due in trade, which re∣spects
the price of sale; and to undersell is look'd
upon as an unfair kind of trading.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="297"/>
ALL these and many more are the reasons,
why a tradesman may be said not to lie, tho'
he should say he <HI>cannot</HI> abate, or <HI>cannot</HI> sell
his goods under such a price, and yet may af∣ter
think fit to sell you his goods something
lower than he so intended, or can afford to do,
rather than lose your custom, or rather than lose
the selling of his goods, and taking your rea∣dy
money, which at that time he may have oc∣casion
for.</P>
<P>IN these cases I cannot say a shop - keeper
should be tied down to the literal meaning of
his words in the price he asks, or that he is
guilty of lying in not adhering stiffly to the let∣ter
of his first demand; tho' at the same time
I would have every tradesman take as little li∣berty
that way as may be; and if the buyer
would expect the tradesman should keep strictly
to his demand, they should not stand and hag∣gle,
and skrew the shop-keeper down, bidding
from one penny to another, to a trifle within
his price, so as it were to push him to the ex∣tremity,
either to turn away his customer for a
six pence, or some such trifle, or to break his
word; as if he would say, I will force you to
speak falsly, or turn me away for a trifle.</P>
<P>IN such cases, if indeed there is a breach, the
sin is the buyer's; at least he puts himself in the
Devil's stead, and makes himself both tempter
and accuser; nor can I say that the seller is in that
case so much to blame as the buyer: how∣ever,
it were to be wish'd, that on both sides
buying and selling might be carried on without
it; for the buyer as often says, I won't give a
<PB N="279" REF="298"/>
farthing more, and yet advances; as the seller
says, I can't abate a farthing, and yet complies.
These are, as I call them, <HI>trading lies;</HI> and it
were to be wish'd, they could be avoided on both
sides; and the honest tradesman does avoid them
as much as possible, but yet must not, <HI>I say,</HI>
in all cases be tied up to the strict, literal sense
of that expression, <HI>I cannot abate,</HI> as above.</P>
<P>2. ANOTHER trading licence is that of ap∣pointings
and promising payments of money,
which men in business are oftentimes forced to
make, and forced to break, without any scruple;
nay, and without any reproach upon their in∣tegrity.
Let us state this case as clearly as we
can, and see how it stands as to the morality of
it, for that is the point in debate.</P>
<P>THE credit nsually given by one tradesman to
another, as particularly by the merchant to the
wholesale-man, and by the wholesale-man to
the retailer, is such, that without tying the buy∣er
up to a particular day of payment, they go
on buying and selling, and the buyer pays mo∣ney
upon account, as his convenience admits,
and as the seller is content to take it: This oc∣casions
the merchant, or the wholesale-men, to
go about, as they call it, <HI>a dunning;</HI> among their
dealers, and which is generally the work of e∣very
<HI>Saturday.</HI> when the merchant comes to
his customer the wholesale-man, or warehouse-keeper,
for money, he tells him, I have no
money, Sir, I cannot pay you now; if you
call next week, I will pay you: Next week
comes, and the merchant calls again, but 'tis
the same thing, only the warehouse-man adds,
<PB N="280" REF="299"/>
Well, I will pay you next week <HI>without fail;</HI>
when the week comes, he tells him he has met
with great disappointments, and he knows not
what to do, but desires his patience another
week; and when the other week comes, per∣haps
he pays him, and so they go on.</P>
<P>NOW what is to be said for this? In the first
place, let us look back to the occasion: This
warehouse-keeper, or wholesale-man, sells the
goods which he buys of the merchant, I say, he
sells them to the retailers, <HI>and 'tis for that rea∣son
I place it first there;</HI> now as they buy in
smaller quantities than he did of the merchant,
so he deals with more of them in number, and
he goes about among them the same <HI>Saturday,</HI>
to get in money that he may pay his merchant,
and he receives his bag full of promises too e∣very
where instead of money, and is put off from
week to week, perhaps by fifty shop-keepers in
a day; and their serving him thus obliges him
to do the same to the merchant.</P>
<P>AGAIN, come to the merchant; except some,
whose circumstances are above it, they are by
this very usage obliged to put off the <HI>Blackwell-hall</HI>
Factor, or the Packer, or the Clothier, or
whoever they deal with, in proportion; and thus
promises go round for payment, and those pro∣mises
are kept or broken as money comes in,
or as disappointments happen; and all this while
here is no breach of honesty, or parol, no lying,
or supposition of it among the tradesmen, ei∣ther
on one side or other.</P>
<P>BUT let us come, I say, to the morality of
it. To break a solemn promise is a kind of
<PB N="281" REF="300"/>
prevarication, that is certain; there is no com∣ing
off of it; and I might enlarge here upon
the first fault, <HI>viz.</HI> of making the promise, which,
say the strict objectors, they should not do: But
the tradesman's answer is this; all those promi∣ses
ought to be taken as they are made, namely,
with a contingent dependence upon the circum∣stances
of trade, such as promises made them by
others who owe them money, or the supposi∣tion
of a week's trade, bringing in money by
retail, as usual, both of which are liable to fail,
or at least to fall short; and this the person
who calls for the money knows, and takes the
promise with those attending casualties; which
if they fail, he knows the shop-keeper, or who∣ever
he is, must fail him too.</P>
<P>THE case is plain, if the man had the money
in cash, he need not make a promise or appoint∣ment
for a farther day; for that promise is no
more or less than a capitulation for a favour,
a desire or condition of a week's forbearance, on
his assurance, that if possible he will not fail to
pay him at the time: It is objected, that the
words <HI>if possible</HI> should then be mention'd;
which would solve the morality of the case: To
this I must answer, that I own I think it need∣less,
unless the man, to whom the promise was
made, could be supposed to believe the promise was
to be perform'd, whether it was possible
or no; which no reasonable man can be suppo∣sed
to do.</P>
<P>THERE is a parallel case to this in the ordina∣ry
appointment of people to meet either at
<PB N="282" REF="301"/>
place or time, upon occasions of business; two
friends make an appointment to meet the next
day at such a house, suppose a Tavern at or near
the <HI>Exchange;</HI> one says to the other, <HI>Do not
fail me at</HI> that time, <HI>for I will certainly be
there;</HI> the other answers, <HI>I will not fail;</HI> some
people, who think themselves more religious
than others, or at least would be thought so,
object against these positive appointments, and
tell us we ought to say, I will, if it please God,
or I will, life and health permitting; and they
quote the text for it, where our Saviour ex∣pressly
commands to use such a caution; and
which I shall say nothing to lessen the force of.</P>
<P>BUT to say a word to our present custom:
Since Christianity is the publick profession of the
country, and we are to suppose we not only
are Christians ourselves, but that all those we
are talking to, or of, are also Christians, we
must add, that Christianity supposes we acknow∣ledge
that life and all the contingencies of life
are subjected to the dominion of Providence, and
liable to all those accidents which God permits to
befall us in the ordinary course of our living
in the world, therefore we expect to be taken
in that sense in all such appointments; and 'tis
but justice to us as Christians, in the common
acceptation of our words, that when I say <HI>I will
certainly</HI> meet my friend at such a place, and
at such a time, he should understand me to mean,
if it pleases GOD to give me life and health, or
that his Providence permits me to come; or as
the text says, <HI>if the</HI> Lord <HI>will;</HI> for we all know,
<PB N="283" REF="302"/>
that unless the Lord will, I cannot meet, or so
much as live.</P>
<P>NOT to understand me thus, is as much as to
say, you do not understand me to be a Christi∣an,
or to act like a Christian in any thing; and
on the other hand, they that understand it other∣wise;,
I ought not to understand them to be
Christians: Nor should I be supposed to put, any
neglect or dishonour upon the government of
Providence in the world, or to suggest that I
did not think myself subjected to it, because I
omitted the words in my appointment.</P>
<P>IN like manner, when a man comes to me
for money, I put him off; that in the first place
supposes I have not the money by me, or can∣not
spare it to pay him at that time; if it was
otherwise, it may be suppos'd I would pay him
just then: He is then perhaps impatient, and
asks me when I will pay him, and I tell him
at such a time; this naturally supposes, that by
that time I expect to be supplied, so as to be a∣ble
to pay; I have current bills, or promises of
money to be paid me, or I expect the ordinary
takings in my shop or warehouse will supply me
to make good my promise; thus my promise is
honest in its foundation, because I have reason
to expert money to come in to make me in a
condition to perform it; but so it falls out,
contrary to my expectation, and contrary to the
reason of things, I am disappointed, and can∣not
do it; I am then indeed a trespasser upon my
creditor, whom I ought to have paid, and I am
under affliction enough on that account, and I
suffer in my reputation for it also; but I can∣not
<PB N="284" REF="303"/>
be said to be <HI>a liar, an immoral man,</HI> a
man that has <HI>no regard to my promise,</HI> and the
like; for at the same time I have perhaps us'd
my utmost endeavour to do it, but am prevent∣ed
by many several men breaking promise with
me, and I am<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o way able to help myself.</P>
<P>IT is objected to this that then I should not
make-my promises absolute, but conditional:
To this I say, that the promises, <HI>as is above
observ'd,</HI> are really not absolute, but condition∣al
in the very nature of them, and are under∣stood
so when they are made, or else they that
hear them do not understand them as all hu∣man
appointments ought to be understood; I
do confess, it would be better not to make, an
absolute promise at all, but to express the con∣dition,
or reserve with the promise, and say, <HI>I
will</HI> if I can, or I will if people are just to me,
and perform their promises to me.</P>
<P>BUT to this I answer, the importunity of the
person, who demands the payment, will not
permit it; nothing short of a positive promise
will satisfy; they never believe the person in∣tends
to perform, if he makes the least reserve
or condition in his promise, tho' at the same
time they know, that even the nature of the
promise and the reason of the promise strongly
implies the condition; I say, the importunity
of the creditor occasions the breach, which he
reproaches the debtor with the immorality of.</P>
<P>CUSTOM indeed has driven us beyond the li∣mits
of our morals in many things, which trade
makes necessary, and which we cannot now a∣void;
so that if we must pretend to go back
<PB N="285" REF="304"/>
to the literal sense of the command, if our
yea must be yea, and our nay nay; if no man
must go beyond, or defraud his neighbour; if
our conversation must be without covetousness,
and the like, why then it is impossible for trades∣men
to be Christians, and we must unhinge all
business, act upon new principles in trade, and go
on by new rules: in short, we must shut up
shop, and leave off trade, and so in many things
we must leave off living; for as conversation, is
call'd life, we must leave off to converse; all
the ordinary communication of life is now full
of lying, and what with table-lies, salutation∣lies,
and trading-lies, there is no such thing as
every man speaking truth with his neighbour.</P>
<P>BUT this is a subject would launch me out
beyond the bounds of a letter, and make a book:
by itself; I return to the cafe particularly in
hand, promises of payment of money; men in
trade, I say, are under this unhappy necessity,
they are forced to make them, and they are
forced to break them; the violent pressing and
dunning, and perhaps threatning too, of the cre∣ditor,
when the poor shop-keeper cannot com∣ply
with his demand, forces him to promise;
in short, the importunate creditor will not be
otherwise put off, and the poor shop-keeper al∣most
worried, and perhaps a little terrified too,
and afraid of him, is glad to do and say any
thing to pacify him, and this extorts a promise,
which when the time comes, he is no more able
to perform than he was before; and this multi∣plies
promises, and consequently breaches, so
much of which are to be placed to the account
<PB N="286" REF="305"/>
of force, that I must acknowledge though the
debtor is to blame, the creditor is too far con∣cern'd
in the crime of it to be excus'd; and it
were to be wish'd, some other method could be
found out to prevent the evil, and that trades∣men
would resolve with more courage to resist
the importunities of the creditor, be the conse∣quence
what it would, rather than break in up∣on
their morals, and load their consciences with
the reproaches of it for all their lives after.</P>
<P>I remember I knew a tradesman, who labour∣ing
long under the ordinary difficulties of men
embarass'd in trade, and past the possibility of
getting out, and being at last obliged to stop and
call his people together, told me, that after he
was broke, tho' it was a terrible thing to him
at first too, as it is to most tradesmen, yet he
thought himself in a new world, when he was
at a full stop, and had no more the terrour up∣on
him of bills coming for payment, and cre∣ditors
knocking at his door to dun him, and he
without money to pay; he was no more obli∣ged
to stand in his shop, and be bullied and
ruffled by his creditors, nay by their apprentices
and boys, and sometimes by Porters and Foot∣men,
to whom he was forced to give good
words, and sometimes strain his patience to the
utmost limits; he was now no more obliged to
make promises, which he knew he could not
perform, and break promises as fast as he made
them, and so lie continually both to God and
man; and he added, the ease of his mind which
he felt upon that occasion was so great, that it
ballanced all the grief he was in at the general
<PB N="287" REF="306"/>
disaster of his affairs; and farther, that even in
the lowest of his circumstances which followed,
he would not go back to live as he had done,
in the exquisite torture of want of money to pay
his bills and his duns.</P>
<P>NOR was it any satisfaction to him to say,
that it was owing to the like breach of promise
in the shop-keepers, and gentlemen, and people
whom he dealt with, who ow'd him money,
and who made no conscience of promising and
disappointing him, and thereby drove him to
the necessity of breaking his own promises; for
this did not satisfy his mind in the breaches of
his word, though they really drove him to the
necessity of it; but that which lay heaviest up∣on
him was the violence and clamour of credit∣ors,
who would not be satisfied without such
promises, even when, he knew, or at least be∣lieved,
he should not be able to perform.</P>
<P>NAY, such was the importunity of one of his
merchants, that when he came for money, and
he was obliged to put him off, and to set him
another day, the merchant would not be satis∣fied,
unless he would swear that he would pay
him on that day without fail; and what said
you to him, <HI>said I?</HI> say to him, <HI>said he,</HI> I
look'd him full in the face, and sat me down
without speaking a word, being fill'd with rage
and indignation at him; but, <HI>says</HI> he, after a
little while he insisted again, and ask'd me what
answer I would make him; at which <HI>I smil'd,</HI>
and ask'd him, <HI>if he was in earnest?</HI> he grew
angry then, and ask'd me if I laugh'd at him?
and if I thought to laugh him out of his money?
<PB N="288" REF="307"/>
ney; I then ask'd him, <HI>says he,</HI> if he really di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
expect I should swear that I would pay him the
next week, as I propos'd to promise? he tol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
me, yes he did, and I should swear it, or pay
him before he went out of my warehouse.</P>
<P>I wonder'd indeed at the discourse, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the folly of the merchant, who I understood a∣terwards
was a foreigner, and though I thought
he had been in jest at first, when he assur'd me
he was not, I was curious to hear the issue,
which at first he was loth to go on with, be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
cause he knew it would bring about all the rest;
but I pressd him to know; so he told me, that
the merchant carried it to such an height as put
him into a furious passion, and knowing he must
break some time or other, he was resolved to
put an end to his being insulted in that man∣ner;
so at last he rose up <HI>in a rage,</HI> told the
merchant, that as no honest man could take such
an oath, unless he had the money by him to
pay it, so no honest man could ask such a thing
of him, and that since he must have an answer,
his answer was, he would not swear such an
oath for him, nor any man living; and if he
would not be satisfied without it, he might do
his worst, and so turn'd from him; and know∣ing
the man was a considerable creditor, and
might do him a mischief, he resolv'd to shut up
that very night, and did so, carrying all his va∣luable
goods with him into the Mint; and the
next day he heard that his angry creditor way-laid
him the same afternoon to arrest: him, but
he was too quick for him, and as he said, tho'
it almost broke his heart to shut up his shop,
<PB N="289" REF="308"/>
yet that being delivere'd from the insulting tem∣per
of his creditor, and the perpetual perplexi∣ties
of want of money to pay people when they
dunn'd him, and above all from the necessity
of making solemn promises for trifling sums,
and then breaking them again, was to him like
a load taken off of his back when he was weary,
and could stand under it no longer; it was a
terror to him he said to be continually Lying,
breaking faith with all mankind, and making
promises which he could not perform.</P>
<P>THIS necessarily brings me to observe here, and
it is a little for the ease of the tradesman's mind
in such severe cases, that there is a distinction
to be made in this cafe between wilful premedi∣tated
lying, and the necessity men may be dri∣ven
to by their disappointments, and other acci∣dents
of their circumstances, to break such pro∣mises,
as they had made with an honest intention
of performing them.</P>
<P>HE that breaks a promise, however, solemnly
made, may be an honest man; but he that makes
a promise with a design to break it, or with no
resolution of performing it, cannot be so: nay,
to carry it farther, he that makes a promise,
and docs not do his endeavour to perform it,
or to put himself into a condition to perform it,
cannot be an honest man: a promise once made
supposes the person willing to perform it, if it
were in his power, and has a binding influence
upon the person who made it, so far as his
power extends, or that he can within the reach
of any reasonable ability perform the conditi∣ons;
but if it is not in his power to perform it,
<PB N="290" REF="309"/>
as in this affair of payment of money is often the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase, the man cannot be condemn'd as dishonest,
unless it can be made appear, either,
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. THAT when he made the promise, he
knew he should not be able to perform it;
or,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THAT he resolv'd when he made the
promise not to perform it, tho' he should be
in a condition to do it; and in both these
cases the morality of promising cannot be ju∣stified,
any more than the immorality of not
performing it.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q></P>
<P>BUT on the other hand the person promising,
honestly intending when he made the appoint∣ment
to perform it if possible, and endeavour∣ing
faithfully to be able, but being rendred un∣able
by the disappointment of those on whose
promises he depended for the performance of his
own; I cannot say, that such a tradesman can
be charg'd with Lying, or with any immorality
in promising, for the breach was not properly
his own, but the peoples on whom he depended;
and this is justified from what I said before, <HI>viz.</HI>
that every promise of that kind supposes the
possibility of such a disappointment, even in the
very nature of its making; for if the man was
not under a moral incapacity of payment, he
would not promise at all, but pay at the time
he promised: His promising then implies, that
he has only something future to depend upon,
to capacitate him for the payment; that is to say,
appointments of payment, by other tradesmen
<PB N="291" REF="310"/>
who owe him (<HI>that promises</HI>). the money,
or the daily supply from the ordinary course of
his trade, suppose him a retailer in a shop, and
the like; all which circumstances are subject to
contingencies and disappointments, and are
known to be so by the person to whom the
promise is made; and it is with all those con∣tangencies
and possibilities of disappointment,
that he takes or accepts the tradesman's promise,
and forbears him, in hopes that he will be able to
perform; knowing that unless he receives mo∣ney
as above, he cannot.</P>
<P>I must however acknowledge, that it is a very
mortifying thing to a tradesman, whether we
suppose him to be one that values his credit in
trade, or his principle as to honest dealing, to
be obliged to break his word; and therefore
where men are not too much under the hatches
to the creditor, and they can possibly avoid it,
a tradesman should not make his promises of
payment so positive, but rather conditional, and
thereby avoid both the immorality and the dis∣credit
of breaking his word; nor will any trades∣man,
I hope, harden himself in a careless for∣wardness
to promise, without endeavouring or
intending to perform, from any thing said in this
letter; for be the excuse for it as good as it
will, as to the point of strict honesty, he can
have but small regard to his own peace of mind,
or to his own credit in trade, who will not a∣void
it as much as possible.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the customary Frauds of Trade, which
honest Men allow themslves to practise,
and pretend to justify.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S there are trading lies which honest
men tell, so there are frauds in trade,
which tradesmen daily practise, and
which notwithstanding they think are
consistent with their being honest men.</P>
<P>IT is certainly true, that few things in na∣ture
are simply unlawful and dishonest, but that
all crime is made so by the addition and con∣currence
of circumstances; and of these I am now
to speak; and the first I take notice of, is
that of taking and repassing, or putting off coun∣terfeit
or false money.</P>
<P>It must be confess'd, that calling in the old
money in the time of the late King <HI>William</HI>
was an act particularly glorious to that reign, and
in nothing more than this, that it delivere'd trade
from a terrible load, and tradesmen from a vast
accumulated weight of daily crime: there was
scarce a shopkeeper that had not a considerable
quantity or bag full of false and unpassble mo∣ney
not an apprentice that kept his master's
<PB N="293" REF="312"/>
cash, but had an annual loss, which they some∣times
were unable to support, and sometimes
their parents and friends were call'd upon for
the deficiency.</P>
<P>THE consequence was, that every raw youth
or unskilful body, that was sent to receive mo∣ney,
was put upon by the cunning tradesmen,
and all the bad money they had was tendred in
payment among the good, that by ignorance or
oversight some might possibly be made to pass;
and as these took it, so they were not wanting
again in all the artifice and slight of hand they
were masters of, to put it off again; so that in
short, people were made Bites and Cheats to one
another in all their business; and if you went
but to buy a pair of gloves, or stockings, or
any trisle, at a shop, you went with bad money
in one hand, and good money in the other, pro∣fering
first the bad coin to get it off if possible,
and then the good to make up the deficiency,
if the other was rejected.</P>
<P>THUS people were daily upon, the catch to
cheat and surprise one another, if they could;
and in short, paid no good money for any thing,
if they could help it: And how did we triumph,
if meeting with some poor raw servant, or ig∣norant
woman, behind a counter, we got off
a counterfeit half crown, or a brass shilling, and
brought away their goods (which were worth the
said half crown or shilling, if it had been good)
for a half crown that was perhaps not worth
sixpence; or for a shilling not worth a penny; as if
this was not all one with picking the shop-keep∣er's
pocket, or robbing his house?</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="313"/>
THE excuse ordinarily given for this practice,
was this, <HI>Viz.</HI> that it came to us for good; we
took it, and it only went as it came, we did
not make it, and the like; as if because we had
been basely cheated by <HI>A.</HI> we were to be al∣low'd
to cheat <HI>B;</HI> or that because <HI>C.</HI> had rob∣bed
our house, that therefore we might go and rob <HI>D.</HI></P>
<P>AND yet this was constantly practised at that
time over the whole nation, and by some of
the honestest tradesmen among us, if not by all
of them.</P>
<P>WHEN the old money was, as I have said,
called in, this cheating trade was put to an end,
and the morals of the nation in some measure
restored; for in short, before that, it was almost
impossible for a tradesman to be an honest man;
but now we begin to fall into it again, and
we see the current coin of the kingdom strange∣ly
crowded with counterfeit money again, both
gold and silver, and especially we have found
a great deal of counterfeit foreign money, as
particularly <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> gold, such as
<HI>Moydores</HI> and <HI>Spanish Pistoles,</HI> which when we
have the misfortune to be put upon with them,
the fraud runs high, and dips deep into our
pockets, the first being twenty seven shillings,
and the latter seventeen shillings; it is true,
the latter being payable only by weight, we are
not often troubled with them; but the former
going all by tale, great quantities of them, have
been put off among us. I find also there is a
great encrcase of late of counterfeit money of
our own coin, especially of shillings, and the
<PB N="295" REF="314"/>
quantity encreasing, To that in a few years more,
if the wicked artists are not detected, the griev∣ance
may be in proportion as great as it was
formerly, and perhaps harder to be redress'd,
because the coin is not likely to be any more
called in, as the old smooth money was.</P>
<P>WHAT then must be done? and how must we
prevent the mischief to conscience and princi∣ple
which lay so heavy upon the whole nation
before? The question is short, and the answer
would be as short and to the purpose, if peo∣ple
would but submit to the little loss that
would fall upon them at first, by which they
would lessen the weight of it as they go on,
and it would never encrease to such a formi∣dable
height as it was at before, nor would it
fall so much upon the poor as it did then.</P>
<P>FIRST, I must lay it down as a stated rule or
maxim in the moral part of the question, <HI>viz.</HI>
That to put off counterfeit base money for
good money, knowing it to be counterfeit, is
dishonest and knavish.</P>
<P>NOR will it take off from the crime of it,
or lessen the dishonesty, to say, <HI>I took it for
good and current money,</HI> and it goes as it comes;
for as before my having been cheated does not
authorise me to cheat any other person, so nei∣ther
was it a just or honest thing in that per∣son
who put the bad money upon me, if they
knew it to be bad; and if it was not honest in
them, how can it be so in me? If then it came
by knavery, it should not go by knavery; that
would be indeed to say it goes as it comes, in
a literal sense that is to say, it came by injus∣tice
<PB N="296" REF="315"/>
and I shall make it go so: but that will
not do in matters of right and wrong.</P>
<P>THE laws of our country also arc directly a∣gainst
the practice; the law condemns the coin
as illegal; that is to say, it is not current mo∣ney;
or, as the lawyers stile it, it is not lawful
money of <HI>England.</HI> Now every bargain or a∣greement
in trade, is in the common and just
acceptation, and the language of trade, made
for such a price or rate, in the current money
of <HI>England;</HI> and tho' you may not exress it
in words at length, 'tis so understood, as much
as if it was set down in Writing: if I cheapen a∣ny
thing at a shop, suppose it the least toy or
trifle, I ask them, What must you have for it?
The shop-keeper answers, <HI>So much;</HI> suppose it
were a shilling, what is the <HI>English</HI> but this,
<HI>One shilling of lawful money of England?</HI> and
I agree to give that shilling, but instead of it
give them, a counterfeit piece of lead or tin,
wash'd over, to make it look like a shilling Do
I pay them what I bargain'd for? Do I give
them one shilling of lawful money of <HI>Eng∣land?</HI>
Do I not put a cheat upon them, and
act against justice and mutual agreement?</P>
<P>To say I took this for the lawful money of
<HI>England?</HI> will not add at all, except it be to
the fraud; for my being deceiv'd does not at
all make it be lawful money: so that in a word,
there can be nothing in that part but encreas∣ing
the criminal part, and adding one knave
more to the number of knaves which the na∣tion
was encumbred with before.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="316"/>
THE case to me is very clear, namely, that
neither by law, justice or conscience, can the
tradesman put off his bad money after he has
taken it, if he once' knows it to be false and
counterfeit money; That it is against law, is
evident, because it is not good and lawful mo∣ney
of <HI>England:</HI> it cannot be honest, because you do
not pay in the coin you agreed for, or
perform the bargain you made, or pay in the
coin expected of you; and it is not just be∣cause
you do not give a valuable consideration,
for the goods you, buy really take a trades∣man's
goods away, and return dross and dirt to
him in the room of it.</P>
<P>THE medium I have to propose in the room
of this, is, that every man who takes a coun∣terfeit
piece of money, and knows it to be such,
should immediately, destroy it; that is to say,
destroy it as money, cut it in pieces, or, as I
have seen some honest tradesmen do, nail it up
against a poll, so that it should go no farther;
it is true, this is sinking so much upon himself,
and supporting the credit of the current coin at
his own expence, and he loses the whole piece,
and this tradesmen are very loth to do; but my
answer is very clear, that thus they ought to
do, and that sundry publick reasons, and seve∣ral
publick benefits would follow to the pub∣lick,
in some of which he might have his share
of benefit hereafter; and if he had not, yet
he ought to do it.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> BY doing thus, he puts a stop to the
fraud; that piece of money is no more made
<PB N="298" REF="317"/>
the instrument to deceive others, which other∣wise
it might do; and tho' it is true that the
loss is only to the last man, that is to say, in
the ordinary currency of the money; yet the
breach upon conscience and principle is to eve∣ry
owner thro' whose hands that piece of mo∣ney
has fraudulently pass'd, <HI>that is to say?</HI> who
have pass'd it away for good, knowing it to be
counterfeit; so that it is a piece of good ser∣vice
to the publick to take away the occasion
and instrument of so much knavery and deceit.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> He prevents a worse fraud, which
is, the buying and selling such counterfeit mo∣ney;
this was a very wicked, but open trade
in former days, and may in time come to be so
again: fellows went about the streets, crying
<HI>Brass money, broken or whole;</HI> that is to say,
they would give good money for bad. It was
at first pretended, that they were obliged to cut
it in pieces, and if you insisted upon it, they
would cut it in pieces before your face; but
they as often got it without that ceremony, and
so made what wicked shifts they could to get it
off again, and many times did put it off for
current money, after they had bought it for a
trifle.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> By this fraud perhaps the same piece
of money might, several years after, come into
your hands again, after you had sold it for a
trifle, and so you might lose by the same shil∣ling
two or three times over; and the like of
other people: but if men were obliged to de∣molish
<PB N="299" REF="318"/>
all the counterfeit money they take,
and let it go no farther, then they would be
sure the fraud could go no farther, nor would
the quantity be ever great at a time; for what∣ever
quantity the false coiners should at any time
make, it would gradually lessen and sink away,
and not a mass of false and counterfeit coin
appear together, as was formerly the case, and
which lost the nation a vast sum of money to
call in.</P>
<P>IT has been the opinion of some, that a pe∣nalty
should be inflicted upon those who offer'd
any counterfeit money in payment; but besides
that there is already a statute against uttering
false money, knowing it to be such; if any o∣ther
or farther law should be made, either to
enforce the statute, or to have new penalties
added, they would still fall into the same diffi∣culties
as in the act.</P>
<P>1. THAT innocent men would suffer, seeing
many tradesmen may take a piece of counter∣feit
money in tale with other money, and real∣ly
and <HI>bona fide</HI> not know it, arid so may offer
it again as innocently as they at first took it
ignorantly; and to bring such into trouble for
every false shilling which they might offer to
pay away without knowing it, would be to
make the law be merely vexatious and torment∣ing
to those against whom it was not intended,
and at the same time not to meddle with the
subtle crafty offender whom it was intended to
punish, and who is really guilty.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="319"/>
2. SUCH an act would be difficultly executed,
because it would still be difficult to know who
did knowingly utter false money, and who did
not; which is the difficulty indeed in the pre∣sent
law: so that upon the whole, such a law
would no way answer the end, nor effectually
discover the offender; much less suppress the
practice. But I am not upon projects and schemes,
'tis not the business of this undertaking.</P>
<P>BUT a general act, obliging all tradesmen to
suppress counterfeit money, by refusing to put
it off again after they knew it to be counter∣feit,
and a general consent of tradesmen to do
so; this would be the best way to put a stop
to the practice, the morality of which is so just∣ly
call'd in question, and the ill consequences
of which to trade are so very well known:
nor will any thing but an universal consent of
tradesmen, in the honest suppressing of coun∣terfeit
money, ever bring it to pass. In the
mean time, as to the dishonesty of the prac∣tice,
however popular it is grown at this time,
I think it is out of question; it can have nothing
but custom to plead for it, which is so far from
an argument, that I think the plea is criminal
in it self, and really adds to its being a griev∣ance,
and calls loudly for a speedy redress.</P>
<P>ANOTHER trading fraud, which, among ma∣ny
others of the like nature, I think worth
speaking of, is the various arts made use of by
tradesmen to set off their goods to the eye of
the ignorant buyer.</P>
<P>I bring this in here, because I really think 'tis
something of kin to putting off counterfeit
<PB N="301" REF="320"/>
money; every false gloss put upon our woollen
manufactures, by hot-pressing, folding, dressing,
tucking, packing, bleeching, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> what are they
but washing over a brass shilling to make it pass
for sterling? every false light, every artificial
side-window, skie-light, and trunk-light we see
made to shew the fine Hollands, Lawns, Cam∣bricks,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> to advantage, and to deceive the
buyers what is it but a counterfeit coin to cheat
the tradesman's customers? an <HI>ignis fatuus</HI> to
impose upon fools and ignorant people, and
make their goods look finer than they are?</P>
<P>BUT where in trade is there any business en∣tirely
free from these frauds? and how shall we
speak of them, when we see them so univer∣sally
made use of? Either they are honest, or
they are not; if they <HI>are not,</HI> why do we, <HI>I say,</HI>
universally make use of them? <HI>if they are</HI> honest,
why so much art, and so much application
to manage them, and to make goods appear
fairer and finer to the eye than they really are?
which in its own nature is evidently a design to
cheat, and that in it self is criminal, and can
be no other.</P>
<P>AND yet there is much to be said for setting
goods out to the best advantage too; for in
some goods, if they are not well dress'd, well
prefs'd and pack'd, the' goods ate not really
shew'd in a true light; many of our woolen
manufactures, if brought to market rough and
undress'd, like a piece of cloth not carried to
the fulling or thicking-mill, it does not shew it
self to a just advantage; nay, it does not shew
what it really is? and therefore such works as
<PB N="202" REF="321"/>
may be proper for so far letting it forth to the
eye may be necessary. For example:</P>
<P>THE cloths, stuffs, serges, druggets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which
are brought to market in the West: and Nor∣thern,
parts of <HI>England,</HI> and in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> as they
are brought without the dressing and making up,
it may be said of them that they are brought to
market unfinished, and they are bought there
again by the wholesale dealers, or cloth-work∣ers,
tuckers and merchants, and they carry them
to their ware-houses and work-houses, and there
they go thro' divers operations again, and are
finished for the market; nor indeed are they
fit to be shew'd till they are so the stuffs are in
the grease, the cloth is in the oil, they are rough
and foul, and are not dress'd, and consequent∣ly
not finished; and as our buyers do not un∣derstand
them till they are so dressed, it is no
proper finishing the goods to bring them to mar∣ket
before, they are not indeed properly said to
be made till that part is done.</P>
<P>THEREFORE I cannot call all those setting
out of goods to be knavish and false; but when
the goods, like a false shilling, are to be set out
with fraud and false colours, and made smooth
and shining to delude the eye, there, where
they are so, it is really a fraud; and tho' in
some cases it extremely differs, yet that does not
excuse the rest by any means.</P>
<P>THE packers and hot-pressers, tuckers and
cloth-workers are very necessary people in their
trades, and their business is to set goods off to
the best advantage; but it may be said too, that
their true and proper business is to make the
<PB N="203" REF="322"/>
goods shew what really they are, and nothing
else: it is true, as above, that in the original
dress, as a piece of cloth or drugget, or stuff
comes out of the hand of the maker, it does
not shew it self as it really is, nor what it
should and ought to shew; thus far these peo∣ple
are properly called finishers of the manu∣factures,
and their work is not lawful only, but
it is a doing justice to the manufacture.</P>
<P>BUT if by the exuberances of their art they
set the goods in a false light, give them a false
gloss, a finer and smoother surface than really
they have; this is like a painted whore, who
puts on a false colour upon her tawny skin to
deceive and delude her customers, and make
her seem the beauty which she has no just claim
to the name of.</P>
<P>So far as art is thus used to shew these goods
to be what they really are not, and deceive the
buyer, so far it is a trading fraud, which is an
unjustifiable practice in business, and which, like
coining of counterfeit money, is making goods
to pass for what they really are not; and is done
for the advantage of the person who puts them
off, and to the loss of the buyer, who is cheat∣ed
and deceived by the fraud.</P>
<P>THE making false lights, skie-lights, trunks,
and other contrivances to make goods look to
be what they are not, and deceive the eye of
the buyer, these are all so many brass shillings
wash'd over, in order to deceive the person
who is to take them, and cheat him of his mo∣ney;
and so far these false lights are really cri∣minal,
they are cheats in trade, and made to
<PB N="304" REF="323"/>
deceive the world; to make deformity look like
beauty, and to varnish over deficiencies; to make
goods which are ordinary in themselves appear
fine; to make things which are ill made look
well; in a word, they are cheats in themselves,
but being legitimated by custom are become a
general practice; the honestest tradesmen have
them, and make use of them, the buyer knows
of it, and suffers himself to be so imposed up∣on;
and in a word, if it be a cheat, as no doubt
it is, they tell us that yet it is an universal cheat,
and no body trades without it; so custom and
usage makes it lawful, and there is little to be
said but this, <HI>Si populus vult decipi decipiatur,</HI>
if the people will be cheated, let them be cheat∣ed,
or they shall be cheated.</P>
<P>I come next to the setting out their goods
to the buyer by the help of the tongue; and
here I must confess our shop-rhetorick is a strange
kind of speech; it is to be understood in a man∣ner
by it self; it is to be taken, not in a lati∣tude
only, but in such a latitude as indeed re∣quires
as many flourishes to excuse it, as it con∣tains
flourishes in it self.</P>
<P>THE end of it indeed is corrupt, and it is al∣so
made up of a corrupt composition, 'tis com∣posed
of a mass of rattling flattery to the buy∣er,
and that fill'd with hypocrisy, compliment,
self-praises, falshood, and in short, a complica∣tion
of wickedness; it is a corrupt means to a
vicious end; and I cannot fee any thing in it
but what a wise man laughs at, a good man ab∣hors
and any man of honesty avoids as much
as possible.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="324"/>
The shop-keeper ought indeed to have a good
tongue, but he should not make a common
whore of his tongue, and employ it to the
wicked purpose of abusing and imposing upon
all that come to deal with him: There is a
modest liberty, which trading license, like the
poctick license, allows to all the tradesmen of
every kind; but tradesmen ought no more to
Lie behind the counter, than the parsons ought
to talk treason in the pulpit.</P>
<P>LET them confine themselves to truth, and
say what they will: But it cannot be done; a
talking rattling mercer, or draper, or milliner,
behind his counter, would be worth nothing if
he should confine himself to that mean silly
thing call'd <HI>Truth;</HI> they must Lie, it is in sup∣port
of their business, and some think they can∣not
live without it: but I deny that part, and
recommend it, I mean, to the tradesmen I am
speaking of, to consider what a scandal it is up∣on
trade, to pretend to say that a tradesman
cannot live without lying; the contrary to which
may be made appear in almost every article.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, I must do justice to the
tradesmen, and must say, that much of it is ow∣ing
to the buyers; they begin the work, and
give the occasion. It was the saying of a very
good shop-man once upon this occasion, That
their customers would not be pleased without
Lying; and why, said he, did <HI>Solomon</HI> reprove
the buyer? he said nothing to the shop-keeper;
<HI>It is naught, it is naught, says the buyer; but
when he goes away, then he boasteth,</HI> Prov. xx.
14. The buyer telling us, adds he, that every
<PB N="306" REF="325"/>
thing is worse than it is, forces us, in justifying
its true value, to tell them it is better than
it is.</P>
<P>IT must be confess'd, this; verbose way of
trading is most ridiculous, as well as offensive,
both in Buyer and Seller; and as it adds nothing
to the goodness or value of the goods; so. I am
sure it adds nothing to the honesty or good mo∣rals
of the tradesman, on one side or other;
but multiplies trading lies on every side, and
brings a just reproach on the integrity of the
dealer, whether he be the Buyer or Seller.</P>
<P>IT was a kind of a step to the cure of this
Vice in trade, <HI>for such</HI> it is, that there was an
old office erected in the city of <HI>London,</HI> for
searching and viewing all the goods which were
sold in bulk, and could not be search'd into by
the Buyer; this was call'd <HI>Garbling</HI> and the
Garbler having view'd the goods, and caused all
damaged or unsound goods to be taken out,
set his seal upon the cask or bags which
held the rest, and then they were vouch'd to be
marketable; so that when the merchant and
the shop-keeper met to deal, there was no room
for any words about the goodness of the ware,
there was the Garbler's seal to vouch that they
were marketable and good; and if they were
otherwise the Garbler was answerable.</P>
<P>THIS respected some particular sorts of goods
only, and chiefly spices and drugs, and die∣stuffs,
and the like; it were well if some other
method than that of a rattling tongue could be
found out, to ascertain the goodness and value
of goods between, the shop-keeper and the re∣tail
<PB N="307" REF="326"/>
tail buyer, that such a flux of falshoods and
untruths might be avoided, as we see every day
made use of' to run tap and run down every
thing that is bought or sold, and that without
any effect too; for take it one time with ano∣ther,
all the shop-keepers lying does not make
the buyer like the goods at all the better;
nor does the buyer's lying make the shop-keeper
sell the cheaper.</P>
<P>IT would be worth while to consider a little
the language that passes between the tradesman
and his customer over the counter, and put it
into plain home-spun <HI>English,</HI> as the meaning
of it really imports; we would not take that
usage if it were put into plain words, it would
set all the shop-keepers and their customers to∣gether
by the ears, and we should have fight∣ing
and quarrelling, instead of bowing and
court sing in every shop; let us hark a little, and
hear how it would found between them; a La∣dy
comes into a mercer's shop to buy some silks,
or to the lace-man's to buy silver laces, or the
like, and when she pitches upon a piece which,
she likes, she begins thus:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I like that colour and that figure well
enough, but I don't like the silk, there's no
substance in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mercer.</SPEAKER>
<P>INDEED, Madam, your Ladiship lies,
'tis a very substantial silk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, No, you <HI>lie</HI> indeed, Sir, 'tis good
for nothing, 'twill do no service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>PRAY, Madam, feel how heavy 'tis; you
will find 'tis <HI>a lie;</HI> the very weight of it may
satisfy you that <HI>you lie,</HI> indeed, Madam</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="308" REF="327"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>COME, come, shew me a better piece;
I am sure you have better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>INDEED, Madam, your Ladiship <HI>lies;</HI> I
may shew you more pieces, but I cannot shew
you a better; there is not a better piece of silk
of that sort in <HI>London,</HI> Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>LET me see that piece of crimson
there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>HERE it is, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>NO, that won't do neither; 'tis not
a good colour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>INDEED, Madam, <HI>you lie;</HI> 'tis as fine a
colour as can be died.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>O fie! <HI>you lie,</HI> indeed, Sir; why it is
not in grain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOUR. Ladiship <HI>lies,</HI> upon my word,
Madam; 'tis in grain, indeed, and as fine as can
be dyed.</P>
</SP>
<P>I might make this dialogue much longer, but
here is enough to set the mercer and the Lady,
both in a flame, and to set the shop in an uproar,
if it were but spoken out in plain language, as
above; and yet what is all the shop-dialect less
or more than this? The meaning is plain; 'tis
nothing but <HI>you lie,</HI> and <HI>you lie;</HI> downright Bil∣lingsgate,
wrap'd up in silk and sattin, and de∣liver'd
dress'd finely up in better cloaths, than
perhaps it might come dress'd in between a
Carman and a Porter.</P>
<P>How ridiculous is all the tongue-padding flut∣ter
between Miss <HI>Tawdry</HI> the semstress, and
<HI>Tattle</HI> my Lady's woman at the <HI>Change</HI> - shop,
when the latter comes to buy any trifle? and
<PB N="309" REF="328"/>
how many lies indeed creep into every part of
trade, especially of retail trade, from the mean∣nest
to the uppermost part of business? 'till in
short 'tis grown so scandalous, that I much won∣der
the shop-keepers themselves do not leave it
off, for the meer shame of its Simplicity and use∣lesness.</P>
<P>BUT habits once gotten into use are very rare∣ly
abated, however ridiculous they are; and the
age is come to such a degree of obstinate folly,
that nothing is too ridiculous for them, if they
please but to make a custom of it.</P>
<P>I am not for making my discourse a satyr up∣on
the shop-keepers, or upon their customers;
if I was, I could give a long detail of the arts
and tricks made use of behind the counter to
wheedle and persuade the Buyer, and manage
the selling part among shop-keepers, and how
easily and dextrously they draw in their custom∣ers;
but this is rather work for a ballad and a
song; my business is to tell the complete trades∣man
how to act a wiser part, to talk to his cu∣stomers
like a man of sense and business, and
not like a Mountebank and his <HI>Merry-Andrew;</HI>
to let him. see that there is a way of managing
behind a counter, that let the customer be what
or how it will, man or woman, impertinent or
not impertinent; for sometimes, I must say, the
men customers are every jot as impertinent as
the women; but I say, let them be what they
will, and how they will, let them make as ma∣ny
words as they will, and urge the shop-keeper
how they will, he may behave himself so as to
avoid all those impertinences, falshoods, foolish
<PB N="310" REF="329"/>
and wicked excursions which I complain of, if
he pleases.</P>
<P>IT by no means follows, that because the buyer
is foolish, the seller must be so too; that be∣cause
the buyer has a never-ceasing tongue, the
seller must rattle as fast as she; that because she
tells a hundred lies to run down his goods, he
must tell another hundred no run them up, and
that because she belies the goods one way, he
must do the same the other way.</P>
<P>THERE is a happy medium in these things;
the shop-keeper, far from being rude to his
customers on one hand, or sullen and silent on
the other, may speak handsomly and modestly'
of his goods what they deserve, and no other,
may with truth (and good manners too) set forth
his goods as they ought to be set forth; and
neither be wanting to the commodity he sells,
or run out into a ridiculous extravagance of
words, which have neither truth of fact or. Ho∣nesty
of design in them.</P>
<P>NOR is this middle way of management at all
less likely to succeed, if the customers have a∣ny
share of sense in them, or the goods he
shews any merit to recommend them; and I
must say, I believe this grave middle way of
discoursing to a customer, is generally more ef∣fectual,
and more to the purpose, and more to
the reputation of the shop-keeper, than a storm
of words, and a mouthful of common shop-language,
which makes a noise, but has little
in it to plead, except to here and there a fool
that can no otherwise be prevail'd with.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="330"/>
IT would be a terrible satyr upon the Ladies,
to say that they will not be pleased or engaged
either with good wares, or good pennyworths,
with reasonable good language, or good manners,
but they must have the addition of long ha∣rangues,
simple, fawning and flattering language,
and a flux of false and foolish words, to set off
the goods, and wheedle them in to lay out
their money; and that without these they are
not to be pleased.</P>
<P>BUT let the tradesman try the honest part,
and stand by that, keeping a stock of fashion∣able
and valuable goods in his shop to shew,
and I dare say he will run no venture, not
need he fear customers; if any thing calls for
the help of noise, and rattling words, it must
be mean and sorry, unfashionable and ordinary
goods, together with weak and silly buyers;
and let the buyers that chance to read this re∣member,
that whenever they find the shop-keeper
begins his noise, and makes his fine
speeches, they ought to suppose he (the shop∣keeper)
<HI>has trash to bring out,</HI> and believes <HI>he
has fools to shew it to.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER. XIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Fine Shops, and Fine Shews.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is a modern custom, and wholly un∣known
to our ancestors, who yet un∣derstood
trade, in proportion to the
trade they carried on, as well as we
do, to have tradesmen lay out two thirds
of their fortune in fitting up their shops.</P>
<P>BY fitting up, I do not mean furnishing their?
shops with wares and goods to sell; for in that
they came up to us in every particular, and per∣haps
went beyond us too; but in painting and
gilding, fine shelves, shutters, boxes, glass-doors,
sashes, and the like, in which they tell us now,
'tis a small matter to lay out two or three hun∣dred
pounds, nay five hundred pounds to fit up
a Pastry-Cook's, or a Toy-shop.</P>
<P>THE first inference to be drawn from this
must necessarily be, that this age must have more
fools than the last; for certainly fools only are
most taken with shews and outsides.</P>
<P>IT is true, that a fine shew of goods will
bring customers; and it is not a new custom,
but a very old one, that a new shop very well
furnished goes a great way to bringing a trade;
for the proverb was, and still is, very true, <HI>that
<PB N="313" REF="332"/>
every body has a penny for a new shop?;</HI> but
that a fine shew of shelves and glass windows
should bring customers, that was never made a
rule in trade 'till now.</P>
<P>AND yet even now I should not except so
much against it, if it was not carried on to such
an excess, as is too much for a middling trades∣man
to bear the expence of; in this therefore
it is made not a grievance only, but really scan∣dalous
to trade; for now a young beginner has
such a tax upon him before he begins, that he
must sink perhaps a third part, nay, a half part
of his stock, in painting and gilding, wainscot∣ing
and glazing, before he begins to trade, nay,
before he can open his shop; As they say of
building a water-mill, two thirds of the expence
lies under the water; and when the poor trades∣man
comes to furnish his shop, and lay in his
stock of goods, he finds a great hole made in
his cash to the workmen, and his shew of goods,
on which the life of his trade depends, is fain
to be lessen'd to make up his shew of boards,
and glass to lay them in.</P>
<P>NOR is this heavy article to be abated upon
any account; for if he does not make a good
shew, he comes abroad like a mean ordinary fel∣low,
and no body of fashion comes to his shop;
the customers are drawn away by the pictures
and painted shelves, tho' when they come there,
they are not half so well fill'd, as in other pla∣ces,
with goods fit for a trade; and how in∣deed
should it be otherwise? the Joiners and
Painters, Glasiers and Carvers, must have all
ready money; the Weavers and Merchants may
<PB N="314" REF="333"/>
give credit, their goods are of so much less; mo∣ment
to the shop-keeper, that they must trust;
but the more important shew must be finish'd
first, and paid first and when that has made a
deep hole in the tradesman's stock, then the
remainder may be spar'd to furnish the shop with
goods and the merchant must trust for the rest.</P>
<P>IT will hardly be believed in ages to come,
when our posterity shall be grown wiser by our
loss, and, as I may truly lay, at our expence,
that a Pastry-Cook's shop, which twenty pounds
would effectually furnish at a time. with all need∣ful
things for sale; nay, except on an extraordi∣nary
shew, as on Twelfth-day at night for cakes,
or upon some great Feast, twenty, pounds can
hardly be laid out at one time in goods for sale,
yet that fitting up one of these shops should
cost upwards of 300 <HI>l. Anno Domini,</HI> 1710, let
the year be recorded: The fitting up to consist
of the following particulars;</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. SASH windows, all of looking-glass plates,
12 inches by 16 inches in measure.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. ALL the walls of the shop lin'd up with
galley-tiles, and the Back-shop with galley-tiles
in pannels, finely painted in forest-work and
figures.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Two large Peir looking-glasses and one
chimney glass in the shop, and one very large
Peir-glass seven foot high in the Back-shop.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Two large branches of Candiesticks, one
in the shop, and one in the back-room.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. THREE great glass lanthorns in the shop,
and eight small ones.</ITEM>
<PB N="315" REF="334"/>
<ITEM>6. TWENTY five sconces against the wall,
with a large pair of silver standing candlesticks
in the back room, value 25 <HI>l.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>7. Six fine large silver salvers to serve sweet-meats.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. TWELVE large high stands of rings, where∣of
three silver, to place small dishes for tarts,
jelleys, &amp;c. at a feast.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. Painting the cieling, and gilding the lant-horns,
the sashes, and the carv'd work, 55 <HI>l.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>THESE with some odd things to set forth the
shop, and make a shew, besides small plate, and
besides china basons and cups, amounted to, as
I am well informed, above 300 l.</P>
<P>ADD to this the more necessary part, which
was,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. BUILDING two ovens, about twenty five
pounds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Twenty pounds in stock for pies, and
checse-cakes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>So that in short here was a trade, which might
be carried on for about 30 or 40 <HI>l.</HI> stock, re∣quir'd
300 l. expence to fit up the shop, and
make a shew to invite customers.</P>
<P>I might give something of a like example of
extravagance in fitting up a Cutler's shop, <HI>An∣glicè</HI>
a Toy-man, which arc now come up to
such a ridiculous expence, as is hardly to be
thought of without the utmost contempt; let
any one stop at the Temple, or at <HI>Paud's</HI> cor∣ner,
or in many other places.</P>

As to the shops of the more considerable
trades, they all bear a proportion of the humour
of the times, but do not call for so loud a re∣mark;
leaving therefore the just reflection which
such things call for, let me bring it home to
the young Tradesman, to whom I am directing
this discourse, and to whom I am desirous to
give solid and useful hints for his instruction; I
would recommend it to him to avoid all such
needless expences, and rather endeavour to fur∣nish
his shop with goods, than to paint and gild
it over, to make it fine and gay; let it invite
customers rather by the well-fill'd presses and
shelves, and the great choice of rich and fashi∣onable
goods, that one customer being well
serv'd may bring another; and let him study to
bring his shop into reputation for good choice
of wares, and good attendance on his custom∣ers?
and this shall bring a throng to him much
better, and of much better people, than those
that go in merely for a gay shop.</P>
<P>LET the shop be decent and handsome, spa∣cious
as the place will allow, and let some∣thing
like the face of a master be always to be
seen in it; and, if possible, be always busy, and
doing something in it, that may look like be∣ing
employ'd; this takes as much with the wi∣ser
observers of such things, as any other ap∣pearance
can do.</P>
<P>I have heard of a young Apothecary, who
setting up in a part of the Town, where he had
not much acquaintance, and fearing much, whe∣ther
he should get into business, hir'd a man
acquainted with such business and made him
<PB N="317" REF="336"/>
be every morning between five and six, and of∣ten
late in the evenings, working very hard at the
great mortar; pounding and beating, tho' he had
nothing to do with it, but beating some very
needless thing, that all his neighbours might hear
it, and find that he was in full employ, being at
work, early and late, and that consequently he
must be a man of vast business, and have a great
practice; and the thing was well laid, and took
accordingly; for the neighbours believing he
had business, brought business to him; and the
reputation of having a trade, made a trade for
him.</P>
<P>THE observation is just; a shew may bring
some people to a shop, but 'tis the same of bu∣siness
that brings business; and nothing raises
the same of a shop like its being a shop of good
trade already; then people go to it, because they
think other people go to it, and because they
think there is good choice of goods; their gild∣ing
and painting may go a little way, but 'tis the
having a shop well fill'd with goods, having
good choice to fell, and selling reasonable, these
are the things that bring a trade, and a trade
thus brought will stand by you, and last; for
fame of trade brings trade any where.</P>
<P>IT is a sign of the barrenness of the peoples
fancy, when they are so easily taken with shews
and outsides of things: Never was such paint∣ing
and gilding, such sasnings and looking-glas∣ses
among the shop-keepers, as there is now; and
yet trade flourish'd more in former times by a
great deal than it does now, if we may believe
the report of very honest and understanding
<PB N="318" REF="337"/>
men; the reason; I think, cannot be to the
credit of the present age, nor is it to the dis∣credit
of the former; for they carried on their
trade with less gaiety, and with less expence
than we do now.</P>
<P>MY advice to a young tradesman is to keep
the safe middle between these extremes; some∣thing
the times must be humour'd in, because
fashion and custom must be followed; but let
him consider the depth of his stock, and not
lay out half his estate upon fitting up his shop,
and then leave but the other half to furnish it;
'tis much better to have a Full shop, than a Fine
shop; and a hundred pounds in goods will make
a much better shew than a hundred pounds worth
of painting and carv'd work; 'tis good to make
a shew, but not to be All shew.</P>
<P>IT is true, that painting and adorning a shop
seems to intimate, that the tradesman has a large
stock to begin with, or else they suggest he
would not make such a shew; hence the young
shop-keepers are willing to make a great shew,
and beautify, and paint, and gild, and carve, because
they would be thought to have a great stock
to begin with; but let me tell you, the reputa∣tion
of having a great stock is ill purchas'd, when
Half your stock is laid out to make the world be∣lieve
it; that is, <HI>in short,</HI> reducing yourself to a
small stock to have the world believe you have
a great one; in which by the way, you do no less
than barter the real stock for the imaginary, and
give away your stock to keep the name of it
only.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="338"/>
I take this indeed to be a <HI>French</HI> humour,
or a spice of it turn'd <HI>English</HI> and indeed we
are famous for this, that when' we do mimick
the <HI>French,</HI> we generally do it to our hurt, and
over-do the <HI>French</HI> themselves.</P>
<P>THE French nation are eminent for making
a fine outside, when perhaps within they want
necessaries; and indeed a gay shop and a mean
stock is something like the <HI>Frenchman</HI> with his
laced ruffles, without a shirt: I cannot but
think a well furnish'd shop with, a moderate out∣side
is much better to a tradesman, than a fine
shop and few goods; I am sure it will be much
more to his satisfaction, when he casts up his
year's account, for his fine shop will weigh but
sorrily in his account of profit and loss; 'tis all
a dead article, 'tis funk out of his first money,
before he makes a shilling profit, and may be
some years a recovering, as trade may go with
him.</P>
<P>IT is true that all these notions of mine in
trade are founded upon the principle of fruga∣lity
and good husbandry; and this is a principle
so disagreeable to the times, and so contrary to
the general practice, that we shall find very few
people to whom it is agreeable: But let me tell
my young tradesmen, that if they must banish
frugality and good husbandry, they must at the
same time banish all expectation of growing
rich by their trade: It is a maxim in commerce,
that money gets money, and they that will not
frugally lay up their gain, in order to encrease
their gain, must not expect to gain as they might
orherwise do; frugality may be out of fashion
<PB N="320" REF="339"/>
among the gentry, but if It coined to be so a∣mong
tradesmen, we shall soon see that weal∣thy
tradesmen will be hard to find; for they
who will not save as well as gain must expect
to go out of trade as lean as they began.</P>
<P>SOME people tell us indeed in many cases,
especially in trade, that putting a good face up∣on
things goes as far as the real merit of the
things themselves; and that a fine, painted, gild∣ed
shop, among the rest, has a great influence
upon the people, draws customers, and brings
trade; and they run a great length in this dis∣course
by satyrising on the blindness and folly
of mankind, and how the world are to be ta∣ken
in their own way; and seeing they are to
be deluded and imposed upon in such ail inno∣cent
way, they ought to be so far deluded and
imposed upon, alluding to the old proverbial,
saying, <HI>Si populus vult decipi, decipiatur;</HI> that
'tis no fraud, no crime, and can neither be a∣gainst
consicience or prudence; for if they are
pleas'd with a shew, why should they not have,
it? <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>THIS way of talking is indeed plausible; and
were the fact true, there might be more in it,
than I think there is: But I do not grant that
the world is thus to be deluded; and that the
people do follow this rule in general, I mean,
to go always to a fine shop to lay out their mo∣ney;
perhaps in some cases it may be so, where
the women, and the weakest of the sex too, are
chiefly concern'd; or where the fops and fools
of the age resort; and as to those few, they
that are willing to be so impos'd upon, let them
have it.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="340"/>
BUT I do not see, that even this extends any
farther than to a few Toy-shops, and Pastry-Cooks;
and the customers of both these are
not of credit sufficient, I think, to weigh in
this case; we may as well argue for the fine
habits at a <HI>Puppet-shew</HI> and a <HI>Rope-dan∣cing,</HI>
because they draw the Mob about them;
but I cannot think, after you go but one de∣gree
above these, the thing is of any weight,
much less does it bring credit to the tradesman,
whatever it may do to the shop.</P>
<P>THE credit of a tradesman respects two sorts
of people, <HI>first,</HI> the merchants, or wholesale
men, or <HI>makers,</HI> who sell him his goods, or
the customers, who come to his shop to buy.</P>
<P><HI>The first</HI> of these are so far from valuing him
upon the gay appearance of his shop, that they
are often the first that take an offence at it,
and suspect his credit upon that account; their
opinion upon, a tradesman, and his credit with
them, is rais'd quite another way, namely, by
his current pay, diligent attendance, and honest
figure; <HI>the gay shop</HI> does not help him at all
there, but rather the contrary.</P>
<P>AS to <HI>the latter,</HI> though some customers may
<HI>at first</HI> be drawn by the gay appearance and
fine gilding and painting of a shop, yet it is
the well sorting a shop with goods, and the
selling good pennyworths that will bring trade,
especially after the shop has been open some
time; this, and this only, establishes the man
and the credit of the shop.</P>
<P>TO conclude; the credit rais'd by the fine
shew of things is also of a differing kind from
<PB N="322" REF="341"/>
the substantial reputation of a tradesman; 'Tis
rather the credit of the shop, than of the man;
and in a word, it is no more or less than a net
spread to catch fools; 'tis a bait to allure and
deceive, and the tradesman generally intends it
so; He intends that the castomers shall pay for
the gilding and painting his shop, and 'tis the
use he really makes of it, <HI>viz.</HI> that his shop
looking like something eminent, he may fell
dearer than his neighbours: who, and what
kind of fools can so be drawn in, it is easy
to describe; but satyr is none of our business
here.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, the customers, who are the
substanstial dependence of a tradesman's shop,
are such as are gain'd and preserv'd by good
usage, good pennyworths, good wares, and good
choice; and a shop that has the reputation of
these four, like good wine that needs no bush,
needs no painting and gilding, no carv'd works
and ornaments; it requires only a diligent ma∣ster
and a faithful servant, and it will never want
a trade.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Tradesman's keeping his Book,
and casting up his Shop.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T Was an antient and laudable custom
with tradesmen in <HI>England</HI> always to
ballance their accounts of stock, and
of profit and loss, at least once every
year; and generally it was done at <HI>Christmas,</HI>
or New year's tide, when they could always
tell whether they went backward or forward,
and how their affairs stood in the world; and
tho' this good custom is very much lost among
tradesmen at this time, yet there are a great ma∣ny
that do so still, and they generally call it,
<HI>casting up shop;</HI> to speak the truth, the great
occasion of omitting it has been from the ma∣ny
tradesmen, who do not care to look into
things, and who fearing their affairs are not
right, care not to know how they go at all,
<HI>good</HI> or <HI>bad;</HI> and when I see a tradesman that
does not cast up once a year, I conclude that
tradesman to be in very bad circumstances, that
at least he fears he is so, and by consequence
cares not to enquire.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="343"/>
As casting up. the shop is the way to know
every year whether he goes backward, or for∣ward,
and is the tradesman's particular satisfacti∣on,
so he must cast up his books too, or else
it will be very ominous to the tradesman's cre∣dit.</P>
<P>NOW, in order to doing this effectually once
a year, 'tis needful the tradesman should keep
his books always in order; his day-book duly
posted, his cash duly ballanced, and all peoples
accounts always fit for a view; he that delights
in his trade will delight in his books; and, as
I said, that he that will thrive must diligently
attend, his shop, or warehouse, and take up his
delight there, so, I say now, he must also dili∣gently
keep his books, or else he will never
know whether he thrives, or no.</P>
<P>EXACT keeping his books is one essential part
of a tradesman's prosperity; the books are the
register of his estate, the index of his stock; all
the tradesman has in the world must be found
in these three articles, or some of them.</P>
<Q><L>Goods in the shop;</L>
<L>Money in cash;</L>
<L>Debts abroad.</L></Q>
<P>The shop will at any time shew <HI>the first</HI> of
these upon a small stop to cast it up; the cash-chest
and Bill-box will shew <HI>the second at demand;</HI>
and the Ledger when polled will shew <HI>the last;</HI>
so that a tradesman can at any time, at a week's
notice, cast up all these three; and then, exa∣mining
his accounts, to take the ballance, which
is a real trying what he is worth in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="344"/>
IT cannot be satisfactory to any tradesman to
let his books go unsettled, and uncast up; for
then he knows nothing of himself, or of his
circumstances in the world; the books can tell
him at any time what his condition is, and will
satisfy him what is the condition of his debts
abroad.</P>
<P>IN order to his regular keeping his books,
several things might be said very useful for the
tradesman to consider;</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>I. EVERY thing done in the whole circumfer∣ence
of his trade must be set down in a
book, except the retail-trade; and this is
clear, if the goods are not in bulk, then,
the money is in cash, and so the substance
will be always found either there, or some∣where
else; for if it is neither in the shop,
nor in the cash, nor in the books, it must he
stolen and lost.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. As every thing done must be set down
in the Books, so it should be done at the
very time of it; all goods sold must be en∣tred
in the books before they are sent out
of the house; goods sent away and not
entred are goods lost; and he that does
not keep an exact account of what goes
out and comes in, can never swear to his
books, or prove his debts, if occasion calls
for it.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>I am not going to set down rules here for
Book-keeping, or to teach the tradesman how
<PB N="326" REF="345"/>
to do it, but I am shewing the necessity and
usefulness of doing it at all: That tradesman,
who keeps no books, may depend upon it, he
will e're long keep no trade, unless he resolves
also to give no credit: He that gives no trust,
and takes no trust, either by wholesale or by
retail, and keeps his cash all himself, may in∣deed
go on without keeping any books at all,
and has nothing to do, when he would know
his estate, but to cast up his shop and his cash,
and see how much they amount to, and that
is his whole and neat estate; for as he owes
nothing, so no body is in debt to him, and
all his estate is in his shop; but I suppose, the
tradesman that trades wholly thus, is not yet
born, or if there ever was any such, they are all
dead.</P>
<P>A Tradesman's books, like a Christian's con∣science,
should always be kept clean and clear;
and he that is not careful of both will give but
a sad account of himself either to GOD or <HI>Man.</HI>
It is true that a great many tradesmen, and espe∣cially
shop-keepers, understand but little of book-keeping,
but 'tis as true that they all understand
something of it, or else they will make but
poor work of shop-keeping.</P>
<P>I knew a tradesman that could not write,
and yet he supplied the defeat with so many
ingenious knacks of his own, to secure the account
of what people ow'd him, and was so exact in
doing it, and then took such care to have but
very short accounts with any body, that he
brought up his method to be every way an equi∣valent
to writing; and, as I often told him,
<PB N="327" REF="346"/>
with half the study and application that those
things cost him, he might have learn'd to write,
and keep books too: He made notches upon
sticks for all the middling sums, and scor'd
with chalk for lesser things; he had drawers
for every particular customer's name, which his
memory supplied for he knew every particular
drawer, tho' he had a great many, as well as if
their faces had been painted upon them; he
had innumerable figures to signify what he would
have written, if he could s and his shelves and
boxes always put me in mind of the <HI>Eg yptian</HI>
Hieroglyphicks, and no body understood them,
or any thing of them but himself.</P>
<P>IT was an odd thing to see him, when a
country-chap, came up to settle accounts with,
him; he would go to a drawer directly, among
such a number as was amazing; in that draw∣er
was nothing but little pieces of split sticks,
like laths, with chalk-marks on them, all as un∣intelligible
as the signs of the Zodiack are to
an old School-mistress that teaches the Horn∣book
and Primmer, or as <HI>Arabick</HI> or <HI>Greek</HI> is
to a Plowman; every stick had notches on one
side for single pounds, on the other side for tens
of pounds, and so higher; and the length and
breadth also had its signification, and the colour
too; for they were painted in some places with
one colour, and in some places with, another; by
which he knew what goods had been deliver'd
for the money: and his way of casting up was
very remarkable, for he knew nothing of fi∣gures;
but he kept six spoons in a place on
purpose, near his counter, which he took out
<PB N="328" REF="347"/>
when he had occasion to cast up any sum, and
laying the spoons on a row before him, he
counted upon them thus:
<Q>One, two, three, and another; one odd spoon, and t'other.</Q></P>
<P>BY this he told up to six; if he had any occa∣sion
to tell any farther, he began again, as we
do after the number ten in our ordinary nu∣meration;
and by this method, and running
them up very quick, he would count any num∣ber
under 36, which was six spoons of six spoons,
and then by the strength of his head he coa'd
number as many more as he pleased, multiply∣ing
them always by six's, but never higher.</P>
<P>I give this instance to shew how far the ap∣plication
of a man's head might go to supply
the defect; but principally to shew (and it does
abundantly shew it) what an absolute necessity
there is for a tradesman to be very diligent and
exact in keeping his books; and what pains
those who understand their business will always
take to do it.</P>
<P>THIS tradesman was indeed a country shop-keeper,
but he was so considerable a dealer, that
he became Mayor of the city which he lived in,
(for it was a city, and that a considerable city
too,) and his posterity-have been very considera∣ble
traders in the same city ever since, and they
shew their great grandfather's six counting spoons
and his hieroglyphicks to this day.</P>
<P>AFTER some time, the old <HI>tradesman</HI> bred up
two of his sons to his business, and the young
<PB N="329" REF="348"/>
men having learned to write, brought books in∣to
the compting-house, things their father had
never used before; but the old man kept to
his old method for all that, and would cast up
a sum, and make up an account with his spoons
and his drawers,, as soon as they could with
their pen and ink, if it was not too full of small
articles, and that he had always avoided
in his business.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, as I have said above, this evident∣ly
shews the necessity of book-keeping to a
tradesman, and the very nature of the thing
evidences also that it must be done with the
greatest exactness. He that does not keep his
books exactly, and so as that he may depend
upon them for charging his debtors, had better
keep no books at all, but, like my shop-keeper,
score and notch every things for as books well
kept makes business regular, easy and certain,
so books neglected turn all into confusion, and
leave the tradesman in a wood, which he can
never get out of without damage and loss; if
ever his dealers know that his books are ill kept
they play upon him, and impose horrid forge∣ries
and falsities upon him; whatever he omits
they catch at, and leave it out; whatever they
put upon him, he is bound to yield to; so that
in short, as books well kept are the security of
the tradesman's estate, and the ascertaining of
his debts, so books ill kept will assist every
knavish customer or chapman to cheat and de∣ceive
him.</P>
<P>SOME men keep a due and exact entry or
journal of all they sell, or perhaps of all they
<PB N="330" REF="349"/>
buy or sell, but are utterly remiss in posting it
forward to a Ledger; that is to say, to another
Book, where every parcel is carried to the
debtor's particular account; likewise they keep
another book, where they enter all the money
they receive, but, as above, never keeping any
account for the man, there it stands in the cash∣book,
and both these books must be ransack'd
over for the particulars, as well of goods sold,
as of the money received, when this customer
comes to have his account made up; and as the
goods are certainly entred when sold or sent
away, and the money is certainly entred when
'tis receiv'd, this they think is sufficient, and all
the rest superfluous.</P>
<P>I doubt not such tradesmen often suffer as
much by their slothfulness and neglect of book-keeping,
as might, especially if their business is
considerable, pay for a Book-keeper; for what
is such a man's case, when his customer, suppose
a country-dealer, comes to town, which perhaps
the does once a year, (as is the custom of other
tradesmen) and desires to have his account made
up? The <HI>London</HI> tradesman goes to his books,
and first he rumages his Day - book back for
the whole year, and takes out the foot of all
the parcels sent to his chapman, and they make
the debtor side of the account; then he takes
his cash-book, if it deserves that name, and
there he rakes out all the sums of money which
the chapman has sent up, or bills which he has
recciv'd, and these make the creditor side of
the account; and so the ballance is drawn out;
and this man thinks himself a mighty good ac∣comptant,
<PB N="331" REF="350"/>
comptant, that he keeps his books exactly; and
so perhaps he does, as far as he keeps them at
all; that is to say, he never sends a parcel away
to his customer, but he enters it down; and
never receives a bill from him, but he sets it
down when the money is paid; but now take
this man and his chap together, as they are
making up this account; The chapman, a sharp
clever tradesman, tho' a countryman, has his
pocket-book with him, and in it a copy of his
posting-book, so the countrymen call <HI>a Ledger,</HI>
where the <HI>London</HI> tradesman's accounts are co∣pied
out, and when the city tradesman has drawn
out his account he takes it to his Inn and ex∣amines
it by his little book; and what is the
consequence?</P>
<P>IF the city tradesman has omitted any of the
bills which the country tradesman has sent him
up, he finds it out, and is sure to put him in
mind of it; Sir, says he, you had a bill from.
me upon Mr. <HI>A—G—,</HI> at such' a time,
for 30 l. and I have your letter that you receiv'd
the money, but you have omitted it in the ac∣count;
so that I am not so much in your debt
by 30 l. as you thought I was.</P>
<P>SAY you so! says the city tradesman, I can∣not
think but you must be mistaken.</P>
<P>NO, no, <HI>says the other,</HI> I am sure I can't be
mistaken, for I have it in my book; besides I
can go to Mr. <HI>A</HI> - - - - - <HI>G</HI> - - - - -, whom the bill
was drawn upon, and there is to be sure your
own endorsement upon it, and a receipt for the
money.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="351"/>
WELL, <HI>says the citizen,</HI> I keep my books as
exact as any body, I'll look gain, and if it be
there I shall find it, for I am sure if I had it 'tis
in my cash-book.</P>
<P>PRAY do then, says the countryman, for I am
sure I sent it you, and I am sure I can produce
the bill if there be occasion.</P>
<P>AWAY goes the tradesman to his books, which
lie pretends he keeps so exact, and examining
them over again, he finds the bill for 30 <HI>l.</HI> en∣tred
fairly, but in his running the whole year
over together, as well he might, he had over∣look'd
it; whereas if his cash-book had been
duly posted every week, as it ought to have
been, this bill had been regularly placed to ac∣count.</P>
<P>BUT now observe the difference; the bill for
30 l. being omitted was no damage to the coun∣try
tradesman, because he has an account of it
in his book of memorandums, and had it re∣gularly
posted in his books at home, whatever
the other had, and also was able to bring suffi∣cient
proof of the payment; so the <HI>London</HI>
tradesman's omission was no hurt to him.</P>
<P>BUT the case differs exceedingly in the debtor
side of the account; for here the tradesman,
who with all his boasts of keeping his books
exactly, has yet no Ledger, which being, as I
have said, duly posted, should shew every man's
account at one view, and being done every
week, left it scarce possible to omit any parcel
that was once entred in the day-book or jour∣nal;
I say, the tradesman keeping no Ledger,
<PB N="333" REF="352"/>
he looks over his day-book for the whole year
past, to draw up the debtor side of his custo∣mer's
account, and there being a great many
parcels, truly he overlooks one or two of them;
or suppose but one of them, and gives the chap∣man
the account, in which he Turns up his
debtor side so much, suppose 136 <HI>l. 10 s.</HI> the
chapman examining this by his book, as he did
the cash, finds two parcels, one 7 l. 15 s. and
the other 9 l. 13. omitted; so that by his own
book his debtor side was 153 <HI>l. 18 s.</HI> but being
a cunning sharp tradesman, and withal not ex∣ceding
honest, Well, well, says he to himself,
if Mr. <HI>G</HI>—says 'tis no more than 136 <HI>l.</HI>
10 <HI>s.</HI> what have I to do to contradict him? 'tis
none of my business to keep his books for him;
'tis time enough for me to reckon for it when,
he charges me. So he goes back to him the
next day, and settles accounts with him, pays
him the ballancc in good bills which he brought
up with him for that purpose, takes a receipt in
full of all accounts and demands to such a day
of the month, and the next day comes and
looks out another parcel of goods, and so be∣gins
an account for the next year, like a cur∣rent
chapman, and has the credit of an extra∣ordinary
customer that pays well, and clears his
accounts every year; which he had not done
had he not seen the advantage, and so strained
himself to pay, that he might get a receipt in
full of all accounts.</P>
<P>IT happens some years after that this city
tradesman dies, and his executors finding his
accounts difficult to make up, there being no
<PB N="334" REF="353"/>
books to be sound but a Day-book and Cash∣book,
they get some skilful book-keeper, to
look into, them, who immediately sees; that the
only way to bring the accounts to a head, is to
form a ledger put of the other two, and post
every body's account into it from the begin∣ning
for tho' it were a long way back, there
is no other remedy.</P>
<P>IN doing this they come to this mistake, a∣mong
a great many others of the like kind in
other chapmens accounts; upon this-they write
to the chapman, and tell him they find him
debtor to the estate of the deceased in such a
sum of money, and desire him to make pay∣ment.</P>
<P>THE country shop-keeper huffs them, tells
them he always made up accounts with Mr. <HI>G—</HI>
the deceased, once a year, as he did with all
his other chapmen; and that he took his receipt
in full of all accounts and demands, upon pay∣ing
the ballance to him at such a time; which
receipt he has to shew; and that he owes him
nothing, or but such a sum, being the account
of goods bought since.</P>
<P>THE Executors finding the mistake, and how
it happened, endeavour to convince him of it;
but 'tis all one, he wants no convincing, for he
knows at bottom how it is; but being a little
of a knave himself, or if you please, <HI>not a little,</HI>
he tells them he cannot enter into the accounts
so far back, Mr. <HI>G—</HI> always told him he
kept his books very exactly, and he trusted to
him; and as he has his receipt in full, and it is
so long ago, he can say nothing to it.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="354"/>
FROM hence they come to quarrel, and the
Executors threaten him with going to law; but
he bids them defiance, and insists upon his re∣ceipt
in full; and besides that, 'tis perhaps six
year? ago, and so he tells them he will plead
the statute of limitations upon them; and then
adds, that he does not do it to avoid a just
debt, but to avoid being imposed upon, he not
understanding books so well as Mr. <HI>G—</HI> pre∣tended
to do, and having ballanced accounts so
long ago with him, he stands by the Ballance,
and has nothing to say to their mistakes, not
he. So that in short, not finding any remedy,
they are forc'd to sit down by the loss; And
perhaps in the course of twenty years trade,
Mr. <HI>G—</HI> might lose a great many such par∣cels
in the whole; and had much better have
kept a Ledger; or if he did not know how to
keep a Ledger himself, had better have hired a
Book-keeper to have come once a week, or
once a month, to have posted his day-book for
him.</P>
<P>THE like misfortune attends the not ballanc∣ing
his cash, a thing which such book-keepers
as Mr. <HI>G—</HI> do not think worth their trou∣ble;
nor do they understand the benefit of it;
the particulars indeed of this article are tedious,
and would be too long for a letter, but certain∣ly
they that know any thing of the use of
keeping-an exact cash-book, know that without
it, a tradesman can never be thoroughly satisfied
either of his own not committing mistakes, or
of any people cheating him, I mean servants,
or sons, or whoever is the first about him.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="355"/>
WHAT I call ballancing his cash-book, is,
first, the casting up, daily, or weekly, or month∣ly
his receipts and payments, and then seeing
what money is left in hand, or, as the usual ex∣pression
of the tradesman is, what money is in
cash; secondly, the, examining his money, tel∣ling
it over, and seeing how much he has in
his chest or bags and then seeing if it agrees
with the ballance of his book, that what <HI>is,</HI>
and: what <HI>should be,</HI> correspond.</P>
<P>AND here let me give Tradesmen a caution
or two.</P>
<P>1. NEVER sit down satisfied with an error in
the cash; that; is to say, with a difference be∣tween
the money really in the cash, and the
ballance in the book; for if they do not agree,
there must be a mistake somewhere, and while
there is a mistake in the cash;, the tradesman
cannot, at least he ought not, to be easy; He
that can be easy with a mistake in his cash,
may be easy with a gang of Thieves in his house;
for if his money does not come right, he must
have paid something that is not set down, and
that is to be supposed as bad as if it were lost;
or he must have somebody about him that can
find the way to his money besides himself; that
is to say, somebody that should not come to it;
and if so, what is the difference between that
and having a gang of thieves about him? for
every one that takes money out of his cash with∣out
his leave, and without letting him know it,
is so far a thief to him: and he can never pre∣tend
to ballance his cash, or indeed know any
thing of his affairs, that does not know which
his money goes.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="356"/>
2. A tradesman endeavouring to ballance his
cash, should no more be satisfied if he finds a
mistake in his cash one way, than another; that
is to say, if he finds more in cash than by the
ballance of his cash-book ought to be there, than
if he finds less, or wanting in cash: I know ma∣ny,
who when they find it thus, sit down satis∣fied,
and say, Well, there is an error, and I
don't know where it lies; but come, 'tis an
error on the right hand, I have more cash in
hand thari I should have, that's all, so I am well
enough, let it go, I shall find it some time or
other. But the tradesman ought to consider,
that he is quite in the dark, and as he, does not
really know where it lies, so for ought he knows
the error may really be to his loss very consI∣derably;
and the case, is very plain that it is as
dangerous to be over, as it would be to be un∣der;
he should therefore never give it over till
he has found it out, and brought it to rights
<HI>For example:</HI></P>
<P>IF there appears to be more money in the
cash than there is by the ballance in the cash∣book,
this must follow, <HI>viz.</HI> That some parcel
of money must have been receiv'd, which is not
entred in the book; now till the tradesman
knows what sum of money this is, that is thus
not entred, how can he tell but the mistake
may be quite the other way, and the cash be
really wrong to his loss? <HI>Thus,</HI></P>
<P>MY cash-book being cast up for the last month,
I find by the foot of the leaf there is cash re∣maining
in hand to ballance 176<HI>l, 10 s. 6 d.</HI>
<PB N="336" REF="357"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="337" REF="358"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/></P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="359"/>
To see if all things are right, I go and tell
my money over, and there, to my surprise, I
find 194<HI>l.</HI> 10<HI>s. 6 d.</HI> in cash; so that I have 18 <HI>l.</HI>
there more than I should have: now, far from
being pleased that I have more money by me
than I should have, my enquiry is plain, How
comes this to pass?</P>
<P>PERHAPS I puzzle my head a great while a∣bout
it, but not being able to find it out, I sit
down easy and satisfied, and say, <HI>Well,</HI> I don't
much concern my self about it, 'tis better to be
so than 18 <HI>l.</HI> missing; I cannot tell where it
lies, but let it lie where it will; here's the mo∣ney
to make up the mistake when it appears.</P>
<P>BUT how foolish is this? how ill-grounded
the satisfaction? and how weak am I to argue
thus, and please my self with the delusion?
for some months after it appears, perhaps, that
whereas there was 38 <HI>l.</HI> entred, receiv'd of Mr.
<HI>B</HI>—<HI>K</HI>—the figure 3 was mistaken,
and set down for a figure of 5, for the sum re∣ceiv'd
was 58 <HI>l.</HI> so that instead of having 18 <HI>l.</HI>
more in cash than there ought to be, I have
40 <HI>s.</HI> wanting in my cash; which my son or my
apprentice stole from me when they put in the
money, and made the mistake of the figures to
puzzle the book, that it might be some time
before it should be discovered.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, take it as a rule, the
tradesman ought to be as unsatisfied when he
finds a mistake to his gain in his cash, as when
he finds it to his loss; and it is every whit as
dangerous, nay, it is the more suspicious, be∣cause
it seems to be laid as a bait for him to
<PB N="339" REF="360"/>
stop his mouth, and to prevent farther enqui∣ries;
and 'tis on that account that I leave this
caution upon record, that the tradesman may be
duly alarm'd.</P>
<P>THE keeping a cash-book is one of the nicest
parts of a tradesman's business, because there is
always the bag and the book to be brought to∣gether,
and if they do not exactly speak the
same language, even to a farthing, there must
be some omission; and how big or how little
that omission may be, who knows? or how
shall it be known, but by casting and re-casting
up, telling, and telling over and over again the
money?</P>
<P>IF there is but twenty shillings over in the
money, the question is, <HI>How came it there?</HI> It
must be receiv'd some where, and of some bo∣dy,
more than is entred; and how can the cash∣keeper,
<HI>be he master or servant,</HI> know but more
was received with it, which is not, and should
have been, entred, and so the loss may be, the
other way? It is true, in telling money there
may have been a mistake, and he that received
a sum of money may have received twenty shil∣lings
too much, or five pounds too much; and
such a mistake I have known to be made in the
paying and receiving of money; and a man's
cash has been more perplexed, and his mind
more distracted about it, than the five pound has
been worth, because he could not find it out,
till some accident has discovered it: and the
reason is, because not knowing which, way it
could come there, he could not know but some
<PB N="340" REF="361"/>
omission might be made to his loss another way,
as in the cease above-mentioned.</P>
<P>I knew indeed a <HI>Strong-water man,</HI> who drove
a very considerable trade, but being an illiterate
tradesman, never ballanced his cash-book for
many years, nor scarce posted his other books,
and indeed hardly understood how to do it; but
knowing his trade was exceeding profitable, and
keeping his money all himself, he was easie, and
grew rich apace, in spight of the most unjusti∣sible,
and indeed the most intolerable negli∣gence;
but lest this should be pleaded as an
exception to my general rule, and to invalidate
the argument, give me leave to add, that tho'
this man grew rich in spight of indolence, and
a neglect of his book, yet when he died two
things appear'd, which no tradesmen in his wits
would desire should be said of him.</P>
<P>I. THE servants falling out, and malice∣ously
accusing one another, had, as it appear∣ed
by the affidavits of several of them, wrong∣ed
him of several considerable sums of mo∣ney,
which they receiv'd, and never brought
into the books; and others, of sums which
they brought into the books, but never brought
into the cash; and others, of sums which
they took ready money in the shop, and ne∣ver
set down, either the goods in the day-book,
or the money into the cash-book; and
it was thought, tho' he was so rich, as not
to feel it, that is, not to his hurt, yet that
he lost three or four hundred pounds a year
<PB N="341" REF="362"/>
in that manner, for the two or three last years
of his life; but his widow and son, who
came after him, having the discovery made
to them, took better measures afterwards.</P>
<P>II. HE never did, or could know what he
was worth; for the accounts in his books
were never made up, nor when he came to
die, could his executors make up any man's
account, so as to be able to prove the particu∣lars,
and make a just demand of their debt;
but found a prodigious number of small sums
of money paid by the debtors, as by receipts
in their books, and on their files, some by
himself, and some by his man, which were
never brought to account, or brought into
cash; and his man's answer being still, that he
gave all to the master, they could not tell how
to charge him by the master's account, be∣cause
several sums, which the master himself
receiv'd, were omitted being entred in the
same manner; so that all was confusion and
neglect; and tho' the man died rich, it was
in spight of that management that would have
made any but himself have died poor.</P>
<P>EXACT book-keeping is to me the effect of a
man, whose heart is in his business, and who
intends to Thrive; he that cares not whether
his books are kept well, or no, is in my opi∣nion
one that does not much care whether he
thrives, or no; or else, being in desperate cir∣cumstances,
knows it, and that he cannot, or
does not thrive, and so matters not which way
it goes.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="363"/>
IT is true, the neglect of the books is private
and secret, and is seldom known to any body
but the tradesman himself; at least 'till he comes
to break, and be a Bankrupt, and then you fre∣quently
hear them exclaim against him, upon
that very account; <HI>break!</HI> says one of the As∣sgnees,
how should he but break? why he kept
no books; you never see books kept in such a
scandalous manner in your life; why, he has
not posted his Cash-book, for I know not how
many months; nor posted his Day-book and Jour∣nal
at all, except here and there, an account that
he perhaps wanted to know the ballance of;
and as for ballancing his cash, I don't see any
thing of that done, I know not how long;
why, this fellow could never tell how he went
on, or how things stood with him, I wonder he
did nor break a long time ago.</P>
<P>Now the man's case was this; he knew how
to keep his books well enough, perhaps, and
could write well enough; and if you look into
his five or six first years of trade, you find all his
accounts well kept, the Journal duly posted,
the cash monthly ballanced; but the poor man
found after that, that things went wrong, that
he went backward, and that all went down hill,
and he hated to look into his books: As a pro∣fligate
never looks into his conscience, because
he can see nothing there, but what terrifies and
affrights him, makes him uneasy and melancho∣ly;
so a sinking tradesman cares nor to look in∣to
his books, because the prospect there is dark
and melancholy; what signify the accounts to
me; says he, I can see nothing in the books
<PB N="343" REF="364"/>
but debts, that I cannot pay and debtors, that
will never pay me; I can see nothing there but
how I have trusted my estate away like a fool,
and how I am to be ruin'd for my easiness, and
being a Sot; and this makes him throw them
away, and hardly Post things enough to make
up when folks call to pay; or if he does Post
such accounts as he has money to receive from,
that's all, and the rest lie at random, 'till, as I
say, the Assignees come to reproach him with
his negligence.</P>
<P>WHEREAS in truth, the man understood his
books well enough, but had no heart to look
in them, no courage to ballance them, because
of the afflicting prospect of them.</P>
<P>BUT let me here advise tradesmen to keep
a perfect acquaintance with their books, though
things arc bad and discouraging; it keeps them
in full knowledge of what they are doing, and
how they really stand; and it brings them some∣times
to the just reflections on their. circumstan∣ces
which they ought to make; so to stop in
time, as I hinted before, and not let things run
too far before they arc surprised, and torn to
pieces by violence.</P>
<P>AND at the worst, even a declining trades∣man
should not let his books be neglected; if
his creditors find them punctually kept to the
last, it will be a credit to him, and they would
see he was a man fit for business; and I have
known when that very thing has recommended
a tradesman so much to his creditors, that after
the ruin of his fortunes, some or other of them
have taken him into business, as into partner∣ships,
<PB N="344" REF="365"/>
or into employment, only because they
knew him to be qualify'd for business, and for
keeping books in particular.</P>
<P>BUT if we should admionish the tradesman to
an exact and regular care of his books, even in
his declining fortunes; much more should it be
his care in his beginning, and before any disaster
has befallen him: I doubt not, that many a
tradesman has miscarried by the mistakes and
neglect of his book; for the losses that men
suffer on that account are not easily set down;
but I recommend it to a tradesman to take ex∣act
care of his books, as I would to every man
to take care of His diet and temperate living,
in order to their health; for tho' according to
some we cannot by all our care and caution
lengthen out life, but that every one must and
shall live their appointed time; yet by temper∣ance
and regular conduct we may make that life
more comfortable, more agreeable, and pleasant,
by its being more healthy and hearty; so tho'
the exactest book-keeping cannot be said to make
a tradesman Thrive, or that he shall stand the
longer in his business, because his profit and loss
does not depend upon his books, or the good∣ness
of his debts depend upon the debtors ac∣counts
being well posted; yet this must be said,
that the well keeping of his books may be the
occasion of his trade being carried on with the
more ease and pleasure, and the more satisfacti∣on,
by having numberless quarrels, and conten∣tions,
and law-suits, which are the plagues of
a tradesman's life, prevented and avoided; which
on the contrary often torment a tradesman, and
<PB N="345" REF="366"/>
make his whole business be uneasy to hurt for
want of being able to make a regular proof of
things by his books.</P>
<P>A tradesman without his books, in case of a
law-suit for a debt, is like a married, woman with∣out
her certificate: How many times has a wo∣man
been cast, and her cause not only lost, but
her reputation, and character expos'd, for want
of being able to prove her marriage, tho' she
has been really and honestly married, and has
merited a good character all her days? and so
in trade, many a debt has been lost, many an
account been perplexed by the debtor, many a
sum of money been recovered, and actually
paid over again, especially after the tradesman
has been dead, for want of his keeping his books
carefully, and exactly when he was alive; by
which negligence, if he has not been ruin'd
when he was living, his widow and children
have been ruin'd after his decease; tho' he, had
justice been, done, he had left them in good cir∣cumstances,
and with sufficient to support them.</P>
<P>AND this brings me to another principal rea∣son,
why a tradesman should not only keep
books, but be very regular and exact in keep∣ing
them in order; that is to say, duly posted,
and all his affairs exactly and duly enter'd in his
books; and this is, that if he should be surpri∣sed
by sudden or unexpected, sickness, or death,
as many are, and as all may be, his accounts
may not be left intricate and unsettled, and his
affairs thereby be perplexed.</P>
<P>NEXT to being prepar'd for death, with re∣spect
to Heaven and his soul, a tradesman should
<PB N="346" REF="367"/>
be always in a state of preparation for death, with
respect to his books; it is in vain that he
calls for a Scrivener or Lawyer, and makes a
will, when he finds a sudden summons sent
him for the grave, and calls his friends about
him to divide, and settle his estate; if his
business is in confusion below stairs, his books
out of order, and his accounts unsettled, to
what purpose does he give his estate among his
relations, when no body knows where to find it?</P>
<P>AS then the minister exhorts us to take care
of our souls, and make our peace with Heaven,
while we are in a state of health, and while
life has no threatening enemies about it, no dis∣eass,
no feavers <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> let me second
that advice to the tradesman always to keep his
books in such a posture, that it he should be
snatch'd away by death, his distressed widow and
fatherless family, may know what is left for them,
and may know where to look for it: He may
depend upon it, that what he owes to any one
they will come fast enough for, and his widow
and executrix will be pull'd to pieces for it, if
she cannot and does not speedily pay it; why
then should he not put her in a condition to
have justice done her and her children, and to
know how and of whom to seek for his just
debts, that she may be able to pay others, and
secure the remainder for herself and her chil∣dren?
I must confess, a tradesman not to leave
his books in order when he dies, argues him
to be either,</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. A very bad Christian, who had few or no
thoughts of death upon him, or that con∣sider'd
<PB N="347" REF="368"/>
nothing of its frequent coming unex∣pected,
and sudden without warning; or,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. A very unnatural relation, without the af∣fections
of a father, or a husband, or even
of a friend; that should rather leave what
he had to be swallow'd up by strangers,
than leave his family and friends in a con∣dition
to find, and to recover it.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>AGAIN, 'tis the same case as in matters reli∣gious,
with respect to the doing this in time,
and while health and strength remain: For as
we say very well, and with great reason, that
the work of eternity should not be left to the
last: moments; that a death-bed is no place, and
a sick languishing body no condition, and the
last breath no time for repentance; so I may add,
neither are these the place, the condition, or
the time to make up our accounts; there's no
posting the books on a death-bed, or ballancing
the Cash-book in a high feaver: Can the trades∣man
tell you where his effects lie, and to whom
he has lent or trusted sums of money, or large
quantities of goods, when he is delirious and
light-headed? All these things must be done in
time, and the tradesman should take care, that
his books should always do this for him, and
then he has nothing to do but make his will,
and dispose of what he has; and for the rest
he refers them to his books, to know where e∣very
thing is to be had.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T must be acknowledg'd, that as this
letter seems to be written in favour of
the women, it also seems to be an of∣ficious,
thankless benefaction to the wives; for
that, as the tradesmens Ladies now manage,
they are above the favour, and put no value up∣on
it; on the contrary, the women, generally
speaking, trouble not their heads about it, scorn
to be seen in the compting-house, much less
behind the counter; despise the knowledge of
their husband's business, and act as if they were
asham'd of being tradesmens wives, and never
intended to be tradesmens widows.</P>
<P>IF this chosen ignorance of theirs comes some
time or other to be their loss, and they find the
disadvantage of it too late, they may read their
fault in their punishment, and wish too late
they had acted the humbler part, and not thought
it below them to inform themselves of what it
is so much their interest to know: This pride
is indeed the great misfortune of tradesmens
wives; for as they liv'd as if they were above
being own'd for the tradesman's wife, so when
<PB N="349" REF="370"/>
he dies, they live to be the shame of the trades∣man's
widow: They knew nothing how he got
his estate when, he was alive, and they know
nothing where to find it when he is dead. This
drives them into the hands of Lawyers, Attor∣neys,
and Sollicitors, to get in their effects;
who, when they have got it, often run away
with it, and leave the poor widow in a more
disconsolate and perplex'd condition, than she
was in before.</P>
<P>IT is true indeed, that this is the womens
fault in one respect, and too often, it is so in
many, since the common spirit is, <HI>as I observ'd,</HI>
so much above the tradesman's condition; but
since it is not so with every body, let me state
the case a little for the use of those who still
have their senses about them; and whose pride
is not got so much above their reason, as to let
them choose to be tradesmens beggars, rather
than tradesmens widows.</P>
<P>WHEN the Tradesman dies, it is to be expect∣ed,
that what estate or effects he leaves is, ge∣nerally
speaking, dispers'd about in many hands;
his widow, if she is left executrix, has the trou∣ble
of getting things together as well as she
can; if she is not left executrix, she has not the
trouble indeed, but then it is look'd upon that
she is dishonour'd in not having the trust; when
she comes to look into her affairs, she is more
or less perplex'd and embarass'd, as she <HI>has not</HI>
or <HI>has</HI> acquainted herself, or been made acquaint∣ed
with her husband's affairs in his life-time.</P>
<P>IF she has been one of those gay delicate La∣dies,
that valuing herself upon her being a gen∣tlewoman,
<PB N="350" REF="371"/>
and that thought it a step below her∣self,
when she married this mechanick thing cal∣led
a tradesman, and consequently scorn'd to
come near his shop, or warehouse, and by con∣sequence
acquainting herself with any of his af∣fairs,
or so much as where his effects lay, which
are to be her fortune for the future: <HI>I say,</HI> if
this has been her case, her folly calls for pity
now, as her pride did for contempt before; for
as she was foolish in the first, she may be mi∣serable
in the last part of it; for now she falls
into a sea of trouble, she has the satisfaction of
knowing that her husband has died, as the trades∣men
call it, well to pass, and that she is left
well enough; but she has at the same time the
mortification of knowing nothing how to get it
in, or in what hands it lies: The only relief
she has is her husband's books, and she is happy
in that, but just in proportion to the care he
took in keeping them; even when she finds the
names of debtors, she knows not who they are,
or where they dwell, who are good, and who
are bad; the only remedy she has here is, if
her husband had e'er a servant, or apprentice,
who was so near out of his time as to be ac∣quainted
with the customers, and with the books,
then she is forced to be beholden to him to set∣tle
the accounts for her, and endeavour to get
in the debts; in return for which she is forced
to give him his time and freedom, and let him
into the trade, make him master of all the bu∣siness
in the world, and it may be, at last, with
all her pride, lets the boy creep to bed to her;
and when her friends upbraid her with it, that
<PB N="351" REF="372"/>
she should marry her 'prentice boy, when it may
be she was old enough to be his mother: <HI>Her
answer is,</HI> “Why, what could I do? I see I
must have been ruin'd else; I had nothing but
what lay abroad in debts, scatter'd about the
world, and no body but he knew how to get
them in: <HI>What could I do?</HI> If I had not done
it, I must have been a beggar.” And so it
may be <HI>she is</HI> at last too, if the boy of a hus∣band
proves a brute to her, as many do, and as
in such unequal matches indeed most such peo∣ple
do.</P>
<P>THUS that pride, which once set her above
a kind, diligent, tender husband, and made her
scorn to stoop to acquaint her self with his af∣fairs,
by which, had she done it, she had been
tolerably qualified to get in her debts, dispose
of her shop-goods, and bring her estate together;
the same pride sinks her into the necessity of
cringing to a scoundrel, and taking her servant
to be her master.</P>
<P>THIS I mention for the caution of those La∣dies
who stoop to marry men of business, and
yet despise the business they are maintain'd by;
that marry the tradesman, but scorn the trade:
If Madam thinks fit to stoop to the man, she
ought never to think her self above owning
his employment; and as she may upon occasI∣on
of his death be left to value her self upon
it, and to have at least her fortune and her chil∣drens
to gather up out of it, she ought not to
profess her self so unacquainted with it as not
to be able to look into it when necessity obliges
her.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="373"/>
IT is a terrible disaster to any woman to be so
far above her own circumstances, that she should
not qualify her self to make the best of things
that are left her, or to preserve her self from
being cheated, and being imposed upon. In
former times tradesmens widows valued them∣selves
upon the shop and trade, or the ware∣house
and trade that was left them; and at least,
if they did not carry on the trade in their own
names, they would keep it up till they put it
off to advantage; and often I have known a
Widow get from 300 to 500 <HI>l.</HI> for the good-will,
as 'tis call'd, of the shop and trade, if she did not
think fit to carry on the trade; if she did, the
case turned the other way, namely, that if the
Widow did not put off the shop, the shop
would put off the Widow: And I may venture
to say, that where there is one Widow that
keeps on the trade now, after a husband's de∣cease,
there were ten, if not twenty, that did
it then.</P>
<P>BUT now the Ladies are above it, and disdain
it so much, that they chuse rather to go with∣out
the prospect of a second marriage, in vir∣tue
of the trade, than to stoop to the mechanick
low step of carrying on a trade; and they have
their reward, for they do go without it; and
whereas they might in former times match in∣finitely
to their advantage by that method, now
they throw themselves away, and the trade
too.</P>
<P>BUT this is not the case which I particularly
aim at in this letter; if the women will act
weakly and foolishly, and throw away the ad∣vantages
<PB N="353" REF="374"/>
that he puts into their hands, be that
to them, and it is their business to take care of
that; but I would have them have the opportu∣nity
put into their hands, and that they may
make the best of it if they please, if they will
not the fault is their own: But to this end, I
say, I would have every tradesman make his
wife so much acquainted with his trade, and
so much mistress of the managing part of it,
that she might be able to carry it on if she pleas∣ed,
in case of his death; if she does not please,
that is another case; or if she will not acquaint
her self with, it, that also is another case, and
she must let it alone: But he should put it into
her power, or give her the offer of it.</P>
<P>FIRST, he should do it for her own sake,
namely, as before, that she may make her ad∣vantage
of it, either for disposing her self and
the shop together, <HI>as is said above,</HI> or for the
more readily disposing the goods, and getting
in the debts, without dishonouring her self, as
I have observed, and marrying her 'prentice boy,
in order to take care of the effects; that is to
say, <HI>ruining</HI> her self to prevent her being <HI>ruin'd.</HI></P>
<P>SECONDLY, He should do it for his childrens
sake, if he has any, that if the wife have any
knowledge of the business, and has a son to
breed up to it, tho' he be not yet of age to
take it up, she may keep the trade for him, and
introduce him into it, that so he may take the
trouble off of her hands, and she may have the
satisfaction of preserving the father's trade for
the benefit of his son, tho' left too young to
enter upon it at first.</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="375"/>
THUS I have known many a widow that would
have thought it otherwise below her, has en∣gaged
her self in her husband's business, and
carried it on, purely to bring her eldest son up
to it, and has preserved it for him, and which
has been an estate to him; whereas otherwise it
must have been lost, and he would have had
the world to seek for a new business.</P>
<P>THIS is a thing which every honest affectio∣nate
mother would, or at least should, be so wil∣ling
to do for a son, that she, I think, who
would not, ought not to marry a tradesman at
all; but if she would think her self above so
important a trust for her own children, she
should likewise think her self above having chil∣dren
by a tradesman, and marry somebody
whose children she would act the mother for.</P>
<P>BUT every widow is not so unnatural, and I
am willing; to suppose the tradesman I am writ∣ing
to, shall be better married, and therefore I
give over speaking to the woman's side, and
I will suppose the tradesman's wife not to be
above her quality, and willing to be made ac∣quainted
with her husband's affairs; as well to
be helpful to him, if she can, as to be in a con∣dition
to be helpful to her self and her family,
if she comes to have occasion: Bat then the
difficulty often lies on the ether side the ques∣tion,
and the tradesman cares not to lay open
his business to, or acquaint his wife with it;
and many circumstances of the tradesman draw
him into this snare; for I must call it a snare
both to him and to her,</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="376"/>
I. THE tradesman is foolishly vain, of mak∣ing
his wife a gentlewoman, and forsooth he
will have her sit above in the parlour, and
receive visits, and drink Tea, and entertain her
neighbours, or take a coach and go abroad;
But as to the business, she shall not stoop to
touch it, he has Apprentices and journeymen,
and there is no need of it.</P>
<P>II. SOME trades indeed arc not proper for
the women to meddle in, or custom has made
it so, that it would be ridiculous for the wo∣men
to appear in their shops; that is, such as
linen and woollen drapers, mercers, book-sellers,
goldsmiths, and all sorts of dealers by
commission, and the like; custom, I say, has made
these trades so effectually shut out the women,
that what with custom, and the women's ge∣nerally
thinking it below them, we never, or
rarely, see any women in those shops or ware∣houses.</P>
<P>III. OR if the trade is proper, and the wife
willing, the husband declines it, and shuts
her out; and this is the thing I complain of
as an injustice upon the woman: But our
tradesmen, forsooth, think it an undervaluing
to them and to their business, to have their
wives seen in their shops; that is to say, that
because other trades do not admit them, there∣fore
they will not have their trades or shops
thought less masculine or less considerable
than others, and they will not have their
wives be seen in their shops.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="377"/>
IV. BUT there are two sorts of husbands
more who decline acquainting their wives
with, their business; and those are, (1.) Those
who are unkind, haughty and imperious, who
will not trust their wives, because they will not
make them useful, that they may not value
themselves upon it, and make themselves as it
were equal to their husbands: A weak, foolish
and absurd suggestion! as if the wife were at all
exalted by it; which indeed is just the con∣trary,
for the woman is rather humbled and
made a servant by it: Or, (2.) The other
sort are those who are afraid their wives should
be let into the knowledge of their business,
left they should come into the grand secret
of all, namely, to know that they are bank∣rupt,
and undone, and worth nothing.</P>
<P>ALL these considerations are foolish or frau∣dulent,
and in every one of them the husband
is in the wrong; nay, they all argue very strong∣ly
for the wife's being, in a due degree, let in∣to
the knowledge of their business; but the last
indeed especially, that she may be put into a
posture to save him from ruin, if it be possible,
or to carry on some business without him, if he
is forc'd to fail, and fly; as many have been,
when the creditors have encourag'd the wife to
carry on a trade for the support of her family
and children, when he perhaps may never shew
his head again.</P>
<P>BUT let the man's case be what it will, I think
he can never call it a hard shift, to let his wife into
an acquaintance with his business, if she desires
<PB N="357" REF="378"/>
it, and is fit for it; and especially in case of
mortality, that she may not be left helpless and
friendless with her children, when, her husband
is gone, and when perhaps her circumstances
may require it.</P>
<P>I am not for a man letting his wife at the
head of his business, and placing himself under
her, like a journeyman, like a certain China∣seller,
not far from the <HI>East-India</HI> house, who
if any customers came into the shop that made
a mean sorry figure, would leave them to her
husband to manage and attend them; but if
they look'd like Quality, and people of fashion,
would, come up to her husband, when he was
shewing them his goods putting him by with
a <HI>Hold your tongue,</HI> Tom, <HI>and let me talk;</HI>
I say, 'tis not this kind, or part that I would
have the tradesman's wife let into, but such,
and so much of the trade only as may be pro∣per
for her, not ridiculous in the eye of the
worlds and may make her assisting and helpful,
nor governing to him, and <HI>which is the main
thing I aim at,</HI> such as should qualify her to
keep up the business for her self and children,
if her husband should be taken away, and she
be left destitute in the world, as many are.</P>
<P>THUS much, I think, 'tis hard a wife should
not know, and no honest tradesman ought to
refuse it; and above all, 'tis great pity the wives
of tradesmen, who so often are reduced to great
inconveniencies for want of it, should so far
withstand their own felicity, as to refuse to be
thus made acquainted with their business, by
which weak and foolish pride they expose them∣selves,
<PB N="358" REF="379"/>
as I have observed, to the misfortune of
throwing the business away, when they may
come to want it; and when the keeping it up
might be the restoring of their family, and
providing for their children.</P>
<P>FOR, not to compliment tradesmen too much,
their wives are not all Ladies, nor are their
children all born to be Gentlemen; trade, on
the contrary, is subject to contingencies; some
begin poor, and end rich; others, and those
very many, begin rich, and end poor: and there
are innumerable circumstances which may attend
a tradesman's family, which may make it abso∣lutely
necessary to preserve the trade for his chil∣dren,
if possible; the doing which may keep
them from misery, and raise them all in the
world; and the want of it, on the other hand,
sinks and suppresses them. <HI>For example:</HI></P>
<P>A tradesman has begun the world about six
or seven years; he has, by his industry and good
understanding in business, just got into a flou∣rishing
trade, by which he clears five or six
hundred pounds a year; and if it should please
God to spare his life for twenty years or more,
he would certainly be a rich man, and get a
good estate; but on a sudden, and in the mid∣dle
of all his prosperity, he is snatch'd away by
a sudden fit of sickness, and his widow is left
in a desolate despairing condition, having five
children, and big with another, but the eldest
of these is not above six years old; and tho' he
is a boy, yet he is utterly uncapable to be con∣cerned
in the business; so the trade which (had his
fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her lived to bring him up in his shop or ware∣house)
<PB N="359" REF="380"/>
would have been an estate to him, is
like to be lost, and perhaps go all away to the
eldest Apprentice, who however wants two years
of his time: Now what is to be done for this
unhappy family?</P>
<P>Done! says the Widow, why I will never let
the trade fall so, that should be the making of
my son, and in the mean time be the mainte∣nance
of all my children.</P>
<P>WHY what can you do, child, <HI>says her Father</HI>
or other Friends? you know nothing of it,
Mr.—did not acquaint you with his
business.</P>
<P>THAT'S true, says the Widow, he did not, be∣cause
I was a fool, and did not care to look
much into it, and that was my fault; Mr.—
did not press me to it, because he was afraid I
might think he intended to put me upon it, but
he often used to say, that if he should drop off
before his boys were fit to come into the shop,
it would be a sad loss to them; that the trade
would make gentlemen of a couple of them, and
it would be great pity it should go away from
them.</P>
<P>BUT what does that signify now, child, <HI>adds
the Father,</HI> you see it is so; and how can it be
helped?</P>
<P>WHY, <HI>says the widow,</HI> I used to ask him if
he thought I could carry it on for them, if
such a thing should happen?</P>
<P>AND what answer did he make? <HI>says the
Father?</HI></P>
<P>HE shook his head, <HI>replied the Widow,</HI> and
answer'd, Yes, I might if I had good servants,
<PB N="360" REF="381"/>
and if I would look a little into it before∣hand.</P>
<P>WHY, <HI>says the Father,</HI> he talked as if he had
foreseen his end.</P>
<P>I think he did foresee it, <HI>says she,</HI> for he was
often talking thus.</P>
<P>AND why did you not take the hint then,
<HI>says her Father,</HI> and acquaint your self a little
with things, that you might have been prepar'd
for such an unhappy circumstance, whatever
might happen?</P>
<P>WHY so I did, <HI>says the Widow,</HI> and have
done for above two years past, he used to shew
me his letters, and his books, and I know where
he bought every thing; and I know a little of
goods too, when they arc good, and when bad,
and the prices; also I know all the country-people
he dealt with, and have seen most of
them, and talk'd with them; Mr.—used
to bring them up to dinner sometimes, and he
would prompt my being acquainted with them,
and would sometimes talk of his business with
them at table, on purpose that I might hear it;
and I know a little how to sell too, for I have
stood by him sometimes, and seen the custom∣ers
and he chaffer with one another.</P>
<P>AND did your husband like that you did so?
<HI>says the Father.</HI></P>
<P><HI>YES, says she,</HI> he loved to see me do it, and
often told me he did so; and told me, that if
he was dead, he believed I might carry on the
trade as well as he.</P>
<P>BUT he did not believe so, I doubt, <HI>says the
Father,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="382"/>
I do not know as to that, <HI>says she;</HI> but I sold
goods several times to some customers, when he
has been out of the way.</P>
<P>AND was he pleased with it, <HI>says her Father,</HI>
when he came home? Did you do it to his
mind?</P>
<P>NAY, <HI>says she,</HI> I have served a customer some∣times
when he has been in the warehouse, and
he would go away to his counting-house on
purpose, and say, I'll leave you and my wife to
make the bargain; and I have pleased the cus∣tomer
and him too.</P>
<P>WELL, <HI>says the Father,</HI> do you think you
could carry on the trade?</P>
<P>I believe I could, if I had but an honest fel∣low
of a journeyman for a year or two, to
write in the books, and go abroad among cus∣tomers.</P>
<P>WELL, <HI>says the Father,</HI> you have two appren∣tices,
one of them begins to understand things
very much, and seems to be a diligent lad.</P>
<P>HE comes forward, indeed, and will be very
useful, <HI>says the Widow,</HI> if he does not grow
too forward, upon a supposition that I shall
want him too much; but it will be necessary to
have a man to be above him for a while.</P>
<P>WELL, <HI>says the Father,</HI> we will see to get
you such a one.</P>
<P>IN short, they got her a man to assist to keep
the books, go to <HI>Exchange,</HI> and do the business
abroad, and the Widow carried on the business
with great application and success, till her eldest
son grew up, and was first taken into the shop
<PB N="362" REF="383"/>
as an apprentice to his mother; the eldest ap∣prentice
serv'd her faithfully, and was her jour∣neyman
four years after his time was out; then
she took him in partner to one fourth part of
the trade, and when her son came of age, she
gave the apprentice one of her daughters, and
enlarged his share to a third, gave her own
son another third, and kept a third for her self,
to support the family.</P>
<P>THUS the whole trade was preserved, and the
son and son-in-law grew rich in it, and the Wi∣dow,
who grew as skilful, in the business as her
husband was before her, advanced the fortunes
of all the rest of her children very considerably.</P>
<P>THIS was an example of the husband's mak∣ing
the wife (but a little) acquainted with his bu∣siness,
and if this had not been the case, the
trade had been lost, and the family left just to
divide what the father left; which, as they were
seven of them, mother and all, would not have
been considerable enough to have raised them
above just the degree of having bread to eat,
and none to spare.</P>
<P>I hardly need give any examples where trades∣men
die, leaving flourishing business, and good
trades, but leaving their wives ignorant and de∣stitute,
neither understanding their business, or
knowing how to learn, having been too proud
to stoop to it when they had husbands, and not
courage or heart to do it when they have none;
the Town is so full of such as these, that this
book can scarce fall into the hands of any readers
but who will be able to name them among their
own acquaintance.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="384"/>
THESE indolent lofty Ladies have generally
the mortification to see their husband's trades
catch'd up by apprentices or journeymen in the
shop, or by other shop-keepers in the neighbour∣hood,
and of the same business, that might have
enrich'd them, and descended to their children;
so see their bread carried away by strangers, and
other families flourishing on the spoils of their
fortunes.</P>
<P>AND this brings me to speak of those Ladies,
who, though they do perhaps, <HI>for want of bet∣ter
offers,</HI> stoop to wed a trade, <HI>as we call it,</HI>
and take up with a Mechanick, yet all the while
they are the tradesmens wives, they endeavour
to preserve the distinction of their fancied cha∣racter;
carry themselves as if they thought they
were still above their station, and that tho' they
were unhappily yoked with a tradesman, they
would still keep up the dignity of their Birth,
and be call'd Gentlewomen; and in order to
this would behave like such all the way, what∣ever
rank they were levell'd with by the misfor∣tune
of their circumstances.</P>
<P>THIS is a very unhappy, and indeed a most
unseasonable kind of pride; and, if I might pre∣sume
to add a word here by way of caution
to such Ladies, it should be to consider, before
they marry tradesmen, the great disadvantages they
lay themselves under, in submitting to be a trades∣man's
wife, but not putting themselves in a
condition to take the benefit, as well as the in∣convenience
of it; for while they are above
the circumstances of the tradesman's wife, they
are depriv'd of all the remedy against the mise∣ries
<PB N="364" REF="385"/>
of a tradesman's widow; and if the man
dies, and leaves them little or nothing but the
trade to carry on, and maintain them, they be∣ing
unacquainted with that, <HI>are undone.</HI></P>
<P>A Lady, that stoops to marry a tradesman,
should consider the usage of <HI>England</HI> among
the Gentry and persons of distinction, where the
case is thus; if a Lady, who has a title of ho∣nour,
suppose it be a Countess, or if she were
a Duchess, it is all one, if, <HI>I say,</HI> she stoops to
marry a private Gentleman, she ceases to rank
for the future as a Countess, or Duchess, but
must be content to be, for the time to come,
what her husband can entitle her to, and no
other; and excepting the courtesy of the peo∣ple,
calling her my Lady Duchess, or the Coun∣tess,
she is no more than plain mistress—
such a one, meaning the name of her husband,
and no other.</P>
<P>THUS if a Baronet's widow marries a trades∣man
in <HI>London,</HI> she is no more <HI>my Lady,</HI> but
plain Mrs.—the Draper's wife, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The
application of the thing is thus; if the Lady
thinks fit to marry a mechanick, say a Glover,
or a Cutler, or whatever it is, she should re∣member
she is a Glover's wife from that time,
and no more; and to keep up her dignity, when
fortune has levell'd her circumstances, is but a
piece of unseasonable pageantry, and will do
her no service at all: The thing she is to en∣quire
is, what she must do if Mr.—the
Glover, or Cutler, should die? whether she can
carry on the trade afterward, or whether she can
live without it? If she finds she cannot live with∣out
<PB N="365" REF="386"/>
out it, 'tis her prudence to confider in time,
and so to acquaint herself with the trade, that
she may be able to do it when she comes to it.</P>
<P>I do confess, there is nothing more ridicu∣lous
than the double pride of the Ladies of this
age, with respect to marrying what they call be∣low
their birth; some Ladies of good families,
tho' but of mean fortune, are so stiff upon the
point of honour, that they refuse to marry tradesmen;
nay? even merchants, tho' vastly above
them in wealth and fortune, only because they
are tradesmen, or, as they are pleas'd to call
them, tho' improperly, <HI>Mechanicks;</HI> and tho'
perhaps they have not above 500 <HI>l.</HI> or 1000 <HI>l.</HI>
to their portion, scorn the man for his rank,
who does but turn round, and has his choice
of wives, perhaps, with 2, or 3, or 4000 <HI>l.</HI> be∣fore
their faces.</P>
<P>THE Gentlemen of quality, we see, act upon
quite another foot, and, I may say, with much
more judgment, seeing nothing is more fre∣quent
than when any noble family are loaded
with titles and honour rather than fortune, they
come down into the city, and choose wives a∣mong
the merchants and tradesmens daughters
to raise their families; and I am mistaken, if at
this time we have not several Duchesses, Coun∣tesses,
and Ladies of rank, who are the daugh∣ters
of citizens and tradesmen, as the Duchess of
<HI>B</HI>—<HI>d,</HI> of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>e,</HI> of <HI>Wh</HI>—<HI>n</HI> and others;
the Countess of <HI>Ex</HI>—<HI>r,</HI> of <HI>Onslow,</HI> and ma∣ny
more too many to name; where it is thought
no dishonour at all for those persons to have
match'd into rich families, tho' not ennobled;
<PB N="366" REF="387"/>
and we have seen many trading families lay the
foundation of nobility by their wealth and opu∣lence;
as Mr. <HI>Child</HI> for example, afterwards
Sir <HI>Josiah Child,</HI> whole pofterity by his two
daughters are now Dukes of <HI>Beaufort</HI> and of
<HI>Bedford,</HI> and his Grandson Lord Viscount <HI>Castle∣main,</HI>
and yet he himself began a mean trades∣man,
and in circumstances very mean.</P>
<P>BUT this stiffness of the Ladies, in refusing
to marry tradesmen, though it is weak in itself,
is not near so weak as the folly of those who
first do stoop to marry thus, and yet think to
maintain the dignity of their birth, in spight of
the meanness of their fortune; and so carry∣ing
themselves above that station, in which Pro∣vidence
has placed them, disable themselves from
receiving the benefit which their condition offers
them, upon any subsequent changes of their life.</P>
<P>THIS extraordinary stiffness, I have known,
has brought many a well-bred Gentlewoman to
misery and the utmost distress, whereas had they
been able to have stooped to the subsequent cir∣cumstances
of life, which Providence also thought
fit to make their lot, they might have lived com∣fortably
and plentifully all their days.</P>
<P>IT is certainly every Lady's prudence to bring
her spirit down to her condition; and if she
thinks fit, or it is any how her lot to marry a
tradesman, which many Ladies of good families
have found it for their advantage to do; I say,
If it be her lot, she should take care she does
not make that a curse to her, which would be
her blessing, by despising her own condition,
and putting herself into a posture not to en∣joy
it.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="388"/>
IN all this I am to be understood to mean
that unhappy temper, which I find so much a∣mong
the tradesmens wives at this time, of be∣ing
above taking any notice of their husbands
affairs; as if nothing was before them but a
constant settled state of prosperity, and it was
impossible for them to tast any other fortune;
whereas that very hour they embark with a trades∣man
they ought to remember, that they are en∣tring
a state of life full of accidents and hazards,
and that innumerable families in as good cir∣cumstances
as theirs fall every day into disasters
and misfortunes, and that a tradesman's condi∣tion
is liable to more casualties, than any other
life whatever.</P>
<P>HOW many widows of tradesmen, nay, and
wives of broken and ruin'd tradesmen do we
daily fee recover themselves and their shatter'd
families, when the man has been either snarch'd
away by death, or demolish'd by misfortunes,
and has been forced to fly to the <HI>East</HI> or <HI>West-Indies,</HI>
and forsake his family in search of
bread?</P>
<P>WOMEN, when, once they give themselves
leave to stoop to their own circumstances, and
think fit to rouze up themselves to their own
relief, arc not so helpless and shiftless creatures
as some would make them appear in the world;
and we see whole families in trade frequently
recover'd by their industry; but then they are
such women as can stoop to it, and can lay
aside the particular pride of their first years; and
who, without looking back to what they have
been, can be content to look into what Provi∣dence
<PB N="368" REF="389"/>
has brought them to be, and what they must
infallibly be, if they do not vigorously apply
to the affairs which offer, and fall into the busi∣ness
which their husbands leave them the intro∣duction
to, and do not level their minds to their
condition: It may indeed be hard to do this at
first, but necessity is a spur to industry, and will
make things easy, where they seem difficult;
and this necessity will humble the minds of those
whom nothing else could make to stoop; and
where it does not, 'tis a defect of the under∣standing,
as well as of prudence, and must re∣flect
upon the senses as well as the morals of the
person.</P>

<DIV1 N="22" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER XXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Dignity of Trade in England more than
in other Countries.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is said of <HI>England</HI> by way of di∣stinction,
and we all value ourselves
upon it, that it is a trading country;
and King <HI>Charles</HI> II. who was per∣haps
that Prince of all the Kings that ever reign'd
in <HI>England,</HI> that best understood the country
<PB N="369" REF="390"/>
and the people that he govern'd, us'd to say,
<HI>That the Tradesmen were the only Gentry in</HI> Eng∣land:
His Majesty spoke it merrily, but it had, a
happy signification in it, such as was peculiar to
the bright genius of that Prince, who tho' he
was not the best governour, was the best ac∣quainted
with the world, of all the Princes of his
age, if not of all the men in it; and tho' it be a
digression give me leave, after having quoted the
King, to add three short observations of my
own, in favour of <HI>England,</HI> and of the peo∣ple
and trade of it, and yet without the least
partiality to our own country.</P>
<P>I. WE are not only A trading country, but
the greatest trading country in the world.</P>
<P>II. OUR climate is the most agreeable climate
in the world to live in.</P>
<P>III. OUR <HI>Englishmen</HI> are the stoutest and best
men (I mean what we call men of their
hands) in the world.</P>
<P>THESE are great things to advance in our own
favour, and yet to pretend not to be partial too;
and therefore I shall give my reasons, which I
think support my opinion, and they shall be as
short as the heads themselves, that I may not
go too much off from my subject.</P>
<P>1. WE are the greatest trading country in
the world, because we have the greatest ex∣portation
of the growth and product of our
<PB N="370" REF="391"/>
land, and of the manufacture and labour of
our people; and the greatest importation and
consumption of the growth, product, and ma∣nufactures
of other countries from abroad, of
any nation in the world.</P>
<P>2. OUR climate is the best and most agree∣able,
because a man can be more out of doors
in <HI>England</HI> than in other countries. This
was King <HI>Charles</HI> the second's reason for it;
and I cannot name it, without doing justice
to his Majesty in it.</P>
<P>3. OUR men are the <HI>stoutest</HI> and <HI>best,</HI> be∣cause
strip them, naked from the wast upwards,
and give them no weapons at all but their
Hands and Heels, and turn them into a room,
or stage, and lock them in with the like num∣ber
of other men of any nation, man for
man, and they shall beat the best men you
shall find in the world.</P>
<P>FROM this digression, which I hope will not
be disagreeable, as it is not very tedious, I come
back to my first observration, that <HI>England</HI> is a
trading country; and two things I offer from
that head.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> OUR tradesmen are not, as in other
countries, the meanest of our people.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> SOME of the greatest and best,
and most flourishing families among not the
gentry only, but even the nobility, have been
rais'd from trade, owe their beginning, their
wealth, and their estates to trade; and I may
<PB N="371" REF="392"/>
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> THOSE families are not at all a∣shamed
of their original, and indeed have no
occasion to be ashamed of it.</P>
<P>IT is true, that in <HI>England</HI> we have a nume∣rous
and an illustrious Mobility and Gentry; and
it is true also, that not so many of those fami∣lies
have rais'd themselves by the sword as in o∣ther
nations, though we have not been without
men of same in the field too.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Trade</HI> and <HI>Learning</HI> has been the two
chief steps, by which our gentlemen have rais'd
their relations, and have built their fortunes;
and from which, they have ascended up to the
prodigious height, both in wealth and number,
which we see them now risen to.</P>
<P>AS so many of our noble and wealthy fami∣lies
are rais'd by, and derive from trade, so it
is true, and indeed it cannot well be otherwise,
that many of the younger branches of our gen∣try,
and even of the nobility itself, have descended
again into the spring from whence they flow'd,
and have become tradesmen; and thence it is,
that, as I faid above, our tradesmen in <HI>England</HI>
are not, <HI>as it generally is in other countries,</HI> al∣ways
of the meanest of our people.</P>
<P>INDEED I might have added here, that trade
itself in <HI>England</HI> is not, as it generally is in o∣ther
countries, the meanest thing the men can
turn their hand to; but on the contrary trade
is the readiest way for men to raise their for∣tunes
and families; and therefore it is a field for
men of figure and of good families to enter
upon.</P>
<Q><PB N="372" REF="393"/>
<HI>N. B.</HI> By trade we must be understood to
include Navigation, and foreign disco∣veries,
because they are generally speak∣ing
all promoted and carried on by trade,
and even, by tradesmen, as well as mer∣chants;
and the tradesmen are at this
time as much concern'd in shipping (as
Owners) as the merchants, only the lat∣ter
may be said to be the chief employ∣ers
of the shipping.</Q>
<P>HAVING thus done a particular piece of just∣ice
to ourselves, in the value we put upon trade
and tradesmen in <HI>England,</HI> it reflects very much
upon the understandings of those refin'd heads,
who <HI>pretend to</HI> depreciate that part of the na∣tion,
which is so infinitely superiour in number
and in wealth to the families who call them∣selves
gentry; or quality, and so infinitely more
numerous.</P>
<P>AS to the wealth of the nation, that undoubt∣edly
lies chiefly among the trading part of the
people; and tho' there are a great many famil∣ies
rais'd within few years, in the late war by
great employments, and by great actions abroad,
to the honour of the <HI>English</HI> gentry; yet how
many more families among the tradesmen have
been rais'd to immense estates, even during the
same time, by the attending circumstances of
the war? such as the cloathing, the paying, the
victualling and furnishing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> both army and
navy? And by whom have the prodigious taxes
been paid, the loans supplied, and money ad∣vanced
<PB N="373" REF="394"/>
upon all occasions? By whom are the
Banks and Companies carried on? And on whom
are the Customs and Excises levied? Has not
the trade and tradesmen born the burthen of
the war? And do they not still pay four millions
a year interest for the publick debts? On whom
are the funds levied, and by whom the publick
credit supported? Is not trade the inexhausted
fund of all funds, and upon which all the rest
depend?</P>
<P>AS is the trade, so in proportion are the
tradesmen; and how wealthy are tradesmen in
almost all the several parts of <HI>England,</HI> as well
as in <HI>London?</HI> How ordinary is it to see a trades∣man
go off of the stage, even but from mere
shop-keeping, with, from ten to forty thousand
pounds estate, to divide among his family? when,
on the contrary, take the gentry in <HI>England</HI>
from one end to the other, except a few here
and there, what with excessive high living,
which is of late grown so much into a dis∣ease,
and the other ordinary circumstances of
families, we find few families of the lower gen∣try,
that is to say, from six or seven hundred
a year downwards, but they are in debt and in
necessitous circumstances, and a great many of
greater estates also.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, let any one who is ac∣quainted
with <HI>England,</HI> look but abroad into
the several counties, especially near <HI>London,</HI> or
within fifty miles of it: How are the antient
families worn out by time and family misfor∣tunes,
and the estates possess'd by a new race of
tradesmen, grown up into families of gentry,
<PB N="374" REF="395"/>
and establish'd by the immense wealth, gain'd,
as I may say, behind the counter; that is, in the
shop, the warehouse, and the compting-house?
How are the sons of tradesmen rank'd among the
prime of the gentry? How are the daughters of
tradesmen at this time adorn'd with the ducal
coronets, and seen riding in the coaches of the
best of our nobility? Nay, many of our trading
gentlemen at this time refuse to be Ennobled,
scorn being knighted, and content themselves with
being known to be rated among the richest
Commoners in the nation: And it must be ac∣knowledg'd,
that whatever they be as to court∣breeding,
and to manners, they, generally speak∣ing,
come behind none of the gentry in know∣ledge
of the world.</P>
<P>AT this very day we see the son of Sir <HI>Tho∣mas
Scawen</HI> match'd into the ducal family of
<HI>Bedford,</HI> and the son of Sir <HI>James Bateman</HI>
into the princely house of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> both
whose ancestors, within the memory of the wri∣ters
of these sheets, were tradesmen in <HI>London;</HI>
the first Sir <HI>William Scawen's</HI> apprentice, and
the later's grandfather a <HI>P</HI>—upon, or near,
<HI>London-Bridge.</HI></P>
<P>HOW many noble seats, superior to the pala∣ces
of sovereign Princes (in some countries) do
we see erected within few miles of this city by
tradesmen, or the sons of tradesmen, while the
seats and castles of the antient gentry, like their
families, look <HI>worn out,</HI> and fallen into <HI>decay;</HI>
witness the noble house of Sir <HI>John Eyles,</HI>
himself a Merchant, at <HI>Giddy-hall</HI> near <HI>Rum∣ford;</HI>
Sir <HI>Gregory Page</HI> on <HI>Black-heath,</HI> the
<PB N="375" REF="396"/>
son of a <HI>Brewer;</HI> Sir <HI>Natthanael Mead</HI> near
<HI>Weal-green,</HI> his father a <HI>Linen-Draper,</HI> with
many others, too long to repeat; and to crown
all, the Lord <HI>Castlemain</HI>'s at <HI>Wanstead,</HI> his fa∣ther
Sir <HI>Josiah Child</HI> originally a Tradesman.</P>
<P>IT was a smart, but just repartee of a <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
tradesman, when a gentleman <HI>who had a
good estate too,</HI> rudely reproach'd him in com∣pany,
and bad him hold his tongue, for he was
no Gentleman; <HI>No, Sir,</HI> says he, <HI>but I can
buy a Gentleman,</HI> and therefore I claim a liber∣ty
to speak among Gentlemen.</P>
<P>AGAIN, in how superior a port or figure (as
we now call it) do our tradesmen live, to what
the middling gentry either do or can support?
An ordinary tradesman now, not in the city
only, but in the country, shall spend more mo∣ney
by the year, than a gentleman of four or
five hundred pounds a year can do; and shall
encrease and lay up every year too; whereas
the gentleman, shall at the best stand stock still,
just where he began, nay, perhaps decline; and
as for the lower gentry, from an hundred pounds
a year to three hundred, or thereabouts, <HI>though
they are often as proud and high in their ap∣pearance
as the other;</HI> as to them, I say, a
<HI>Shoemaker</HI> in <HI>London</HI> shall keep a better house,
spend more money, cloath his family better, and
yet grow rich too: It is evident where the dif∣ference
lies, <HI>an Estate's a pond,</HI> but <HI>a Trade's a
spring;</HI> The first, if it keeps full, and the wa∣ter
wholesom, by the ordinary supplies and dreins
from the neighbouring grounds, 'tis well, and 'tis
all that is expected; but the other is an inex∣hausted
<PB N="376" REF="397"/>
current, which not only fills the pond,
and keeps it full, but is continually running o∣ver,
and fills all the lower ponds and places a∣bout
it.</P>
<P>THIS being the case in <HI>England,</HI> and our
trade being so vastly great, it is no wonder that
the tradesmen in <HI>England</HI> fill the lists of our no∣bility
and gentry; no wonder that the gentle∣men
of the best families marry tradesmen's
daughters, and put their younger sons appren∣tices
to tradesmen; and how often do these
younger sons come to buy the elder sons estates,
and restore the family, when, the elder, and head
of the house, proving rakish and extravagant,
has wasted his patrimony, and is obliged to
make out the blessing of <HI>Israel</HI>'s family, where
the younger son bought the birth-right, and the
elder was doom'd to serve him?</P>
<P>TRADE is so far <HI>here</HI> from being inconsistent
with a Gentleman, that <HI>in short</HI> trade in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
makes Gentlemen, and has peopled this na∣tion
with Gentlemen; for after a generation or
two the tradesmen's children, or at least their
grand-children, come to be as good Gentlemen,
Statesmen, Parliament-men, Privy-Counsellors,
Judges, Bishops, and Noblemen, as those of the
highest birth and the most antient families; and
nothing too high for them: Thus the late Earl
of <HI>Haversham</HI> was originally a Merchant, the
late Secretary <HI>Craggs</HI> was the son of a <HI>Barber;</HI>
the present Lord <HI>Castlemain's</HI> father was a Trades∣man;
the great grandfather of the present Duke
of <HI>Bedford</HI> the same, and so of several others:
Nor do we find any defect either in the genius or
<PB N="377" REF="398"/>
capacities of the posterity of tradesmen, arising
from any remains of mechanick blood, which
'tis pretended should influence them; but all
the gallantry of spirit, greatness of soul, and all the
generous principles, that can be found in any of
the antient families, whose blood is the most
untainted, as they call it, with the low mixtures
of a mechanick race, are found in these; and,
as is said before, they generally go beyond them
in knowledge of the world, which is the best
education.</P>
<P>WE see the tradesmen of <HI>England,</HI> as they
grow wealthy, coming every day to the Herald's
office, to search for the Coats of Arms of their
ancestors, in order to paint them upon their
coaches, and engrave them upon their plate, em∣broider
them upon their furniture, or carve them
upon the pediments of their new houses; and
how often do we see them trace the registers of
their families up to the prime nobility, or the
most antient gentry of the kingdom?</P>
<P>IN this search we find them often qualified
to raise new families, if they do not descend
from old; as was said of a certain tradesman
of <HI>London,</HI> that if he could not find the anti∣ent
race of Gentlemen, from which he came,
he would begin a new race, who should be as
good Gentlemen as any that went before them:
They tell us a story of the old Lord <HI>Craven,</HI>
who was afterwards created Earl of <HI>Craven</HI> by
King <HI>Charles</HI> II. that being upbraided with his
being of an upstart nobility, by the famous <HI>Au∣bery,</HI>
Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> who was himself of the
very antient family of the <HI>Veres,</HI> Earls of <HI>Ox∣ford,</HI>
<PB N="378" REF="399"/>
the Lord <HI>Craven</HI> told him, he (<HI>Craven</HI>)
would Cap pedigrees with him (<HI>Oxford</HI>) for a
wager; the Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> laugh'd at the chal∣lenge,
and began, reckoning up his famous an∣cestors,
who had been Earls of <HI>Oxford</HI> for an
hundred years past, and Knights for some hun∣dreds
of years more; but when my Lord <HI>Cra∣ven</HI>
began, he read over his family thus; I am
<HI>William</HI> Lord <HI>Craven,</HI> my father was <HI>Lord</HI> May∣or
of <HI>London,</HI> and my grandfather was the <HI>Lord
knows who;</HI> wherefore I think my pedigree as
good as yours, my Lord, (meaning the Earl of
<HI>Oxford:</HI>) The story was merry enough, but is
to my purpose exactly; for let the grandfa∣ther
be who he would, his father Sir <HI>William
Craven,</HI> who was Lord-Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> was
a Wholesale-<HI>Grocer,</HI> and rais'd the family by
trade, and yet no body doubts but that the fa∣mily
of <HI>Craven</HI> is at this day, as truly noble in
all the beauties which adorn noble birth and
blood, as can be desir'd of any family, however
antient, or antiently noble.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Italy,</HI> and especially at <HI>Venice,</HI> we see e∣very
day the sons of merchants, and other trades,
who grow in wealth and estates, and can advance
for the service of their country a considerable
sum of money, <HI>viz.</HI> 60000 to 100000 dollars,
are accepted to honour by the Senate, and trans∣lated
into the list of the nobility; without any
regard to the antiquities of their families, or the
nobility of blood; and in all ages the best Kings
and sovereign Princes have thought fit to re∣ward
the extraordinary merit of their subjects
with titles of honour, and to rank men among
<PB N="379" REF="400"/>
their nobility, who have deserv'd it by good
and great actions, whether their birth and the
antiquity of their families entituled them to it,
or not.</P>
<P>THUS in the late wars between <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>France,</HI> how was our army full of excellent
officers, who went from <HI>the shop,</HI> and from be∣hind
<HI>the counter,</HI> into the camp, and who di∣stinguish'd
themselves there by their merit and
gallant behaviour? And several such came to
command Regiments, and even to be General
Officers, and to gain as much reputation in the
service as any; as Colonel <HI>Peirce, Wood, Rich∣ards,</HI>
and several others, that might be nam'd.</P>
<P>ALL this confirms what I have said before,
<HI>viz.</HI> that trade in <HI>England</HI> neither is or ought
to be levell'd with what it is in other countries;
or the Tradesmen depreciated as they are abroad,
and as some of our Gentry would pretend to do
in <HI>England;</HI> but that as many of our best fa∣milies
rose from trade, so many branches of the
best families in <HI>England,</HI> under the nobility,
have stoop'd so low as to be put apprentices to
tradesmen in <HI>London,</HI> and to set up and follow
those trades when they have come out of their
times, and have thought it no dishonour to their blood.</P>
<P>TO bring this once more home to the La∣dies,
who are so scandaliz'd at that mean step,
which they call it, of marrying a Tradesman; it
may be told them for their humiliation, that,
however they think fit to act, sometimes those
tradesmen come of better families than their
own; and oftentimes, when they have refus'd
<PB N="380" REF="401"/>
them to their loss, those very tradesmen have
married Ladies of superior fortune to them,
and have rais'd families of their own, who in
one generation have been superiour to those nice
Ladies both in dignity and estate, and have, to
their great mortification, been rank'd above them
upon all publick occasions.</P>
<P>THE word <HI>Tradesman</HI> in <HI>England</HI> does not
sound so harsh, as it does in other countries;
and to say a Gentleman-tradesman is not so much
nonsense, as some people would persuade us to
reckon it; and indeed, as trade is now flou∣rishing
in <HI>England,</HI> and encreasing, and the
wealth of our tradesmen is already so great; 'tis
very probable, a few years will shew us still a
greater race of trade-bred Gentlemen, than ever
<HI>England</HI> yet had.</P>
<P>THE very name of an <HI>English</HI> tradesman will
and does already obtain in the world; and as
our soldiers by the late war gain'd the reputation
of being some of the best troops in the world,
and our seamen are at this day, and very justly
too, esteem'd the best Sailors in the world; so
the <HI>English Tradesmen</HI> may in a few years be
allow'd to rank with the best gentlemen in <HI>Eu∣rope;</HI>
and as the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> said of the
merchants of <HI>Tyre,</HI> that <HI>her traffickers were the
Honourable of the earth,</HI> Isai. xxiii. 8.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, 'tis evident their wealth
at this time out-does that of the like rank of
any nation in <HI>Europe;</HI> and as their number is
prodigious, so is their commerce; for the in∣land
commerce of <HI>England</HI> (and 'tis of those
<HI>tradesmen,</HI> or <HI>traffickers,</HI> that I am now speak∣ing
<PB N="381" REF="402"/>
in particular) is certainly the greatest of its
kind of any in the world; nor is it possible
there should ever be any like it, the consump∣tion
of all sorts of goods, both of our own
manufacture, and of foreign growth, being so
exceeding great.</P>
<P>IF the <HI>English</HI> nation was to be nearly en∣quired
into, and its present opulence and great∣ness
duly weigh'd, it would appear, that as the
figure it now makes in <HI>Europe</HI> is greater than
it ever made before, take it either in King <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>
the Third's reign, or in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s,
which were the two chief points of time when
the <HI>English</HI> same was in its highest extent; <HI>I say,</HI>
if its present greatness was to be duly weighed,
there is no comparison in its wealth, The num∣ber
of its people, the value of its lands, the
greatness of the estates of its private inhabi∣tants,
and (in consequence of all this) its real
strength is infinitely beyond whatever it was be∣fore;
and if it were needful, I could fill up this
work with a very agreeable and useful enquiry
into the particulars.</P>
<P>BUT I content my self with turning it to the
case in hand, for the truth of fact is not to be
disputed: <HI>I say,</HI> I turn it to the case in hand
<HI>thus,</HI> Whence comes it to be so? How is it pro∣duced?
War has not done it; no, nor so much
as helped or assisted to it; it is not by any mar∣tial
exploits; we have made no conquests abroad,
added no new kingdoms to the <HI>British</HI> empire,
reduced no neighbouring nations, or extended
the possession of our monarchs into the proper∣ties
of others; we have gain'd nothing by war
<PB N="382" REF="403"/>
and encroachment; we are Butted and Bounded
just where we were in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s time;
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the <HI>Flemings,</HI> the <HI>French,</HI> are in view
of us, just as they were then; we have subjected
no new provinces or people to our govern∣ment;
and with few or no exceptions, we are
almost for dominion where King <HI>Edward</HI> I.
left us; nay, we have lost all the dominions
which our antient Kings for some hundreds of
years held in <HI>France;</HI> such as the rich and pow∣erful
provinces of <HI>Normandy, Poictou, Gas∣cogne,
Bretaign,</HI> and <HI>Acquitain;</HI> and instead of
being enrich'd by war and victory, on the con∣trary
we have been torn in pieces by civil wars
and rebellions, as well in <HI>Ireland</HI> as in <HI>Eng∣land;</HI>
and that several times; to the ruin of our
richest families, and the slaughter of our Nobi∣lity
and Gentry; nay, to the destruction even of
monarchy it self, and this many years at a time,
as in the long bloody wars between the houses
of <HI>Lancaster</HI> and <HI>York,</HI> the many rebellions of
the <HI>Irish,</HI> as well in Queen <HI>Elizabeth's</HI> time, as
in King <HI>Charles</HI> the First's time, and the fatal
massacre, and almost extirpation of the <HI>English</HI>
name in that kingdom; and at last, the late re∣bellion
in <HI>England,</HI> in which the Monarch fell
a sacrifice to the fury of the people, and Mo∣narchy
it self gave way to tyranny and usurpa∣tion,
for almost twenty years.</P>
<P>THESE things prove abundantly that the ri∣sing
greatness of the <HI>British</HI> nation is not ow∣ing
to war and conquests, to enlarging its do∣minion
by the sword, or subjecting the people
of other countries to our power; but it is all
<PB N="383" REF="404"/>
owing to trade, to the encrease of our com∣merce
at home, and the extending it abroad.</P>
<P>IT is owing to trade, that new discoveries
have been made in lands unknown, and new
settlements and plantations made, new colonies
placed, and new governments formed in the
uninhabited islands, and the uncultivated conti∣nent
of <HI>America;</HI> and those plantings and set∣tlements
have again enlarged and encreased the
trade, and thereby the wealth and power of the
nation, by whom they were discovered and
planted: We have not encreased our power, or
the number of our subjects, by subduing the
nations which possess'd those countries, and en∣corporating
them into our own; but have en∣tirely
planted our colonies, and peopled the
countries with our own subjects, natives of this
island; and, excepting the negroes, which we
transport from <HI>Africa</HI> to <HI>America,</HI> as slaves to
work in the sugar and tobacco plantations; all
our Colonies, as well in the islands as on the
continent of <HI>America,</HI> are entirely peopled from
<HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and chiefly the for∣mer;
the natives having either removed farther
up into the country, or by their own folly and
treachery raising war against us, been destroy'd
and cut off.</P>
<P>As trade alone has peopled those countries,
so trading with them has rais'd them also to a
prodigy of wealth and Opulence; and we see
now the ordinary planters at <HI>Jamaica</HI> and <HI>Bar∣badoes</HI>
rise to immense estates, riding in their
coaches and six, especially at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> with
twenty or thirty negroes on foot running be∣fore
<PB N="384" REF="405"/>
them whenever they please to appear in
publick.</P>
<P>AS trade has thus extended our Colonies a∣broad,
so it has (except those Colonies) kept
our people at home, where they are multiplied
to that prodigious degree, and do still continue
to multiply in such a manner, that if it goes on
so, time may come that all the lands in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
will do little more than serve for gardens
for them, and to feed their cows; and their
corn and cattle be supplied from <HI>Scotland</HI> and
<HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT is the reason that we see numbers of
<HI>French,</HI> and of <HI>Scots,</HI> and of <HI>Germans,</HI> in all
the foreign nations in <HI>Europe;</HI> and especially
filling up their armies and courts, and that you
see few or no <HI>English</HI> there?</P>
<P>WHAT is the reason, that when we want to
raise armies, or to man navies in <HI>England,</HI> we
are oblig'd to press the seamen, and to make
laws and empower the justices of the peace,
and magistrates of towns, to force men to go
for soldiers, and enter into the service, or al∣lure
them by giving Bounty-money as an en∣couragement
to men to list themselves? where∣as
the people of other nations, and even the
<HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Irish,</HI> travel abroad (and run into all
the neighbour nations) to seek service, and to be
admitted into their pay.</P>
<P>WHAT is it but trade? the encrease of busi∣ness
at home, and the employment of the poor
in the business and manufactures of this king∣dom,
by which the poor get so good wages, and
live so well, that they will not list for soldiers;
<PB N="385" REF="406"/>
and have so good pay in the merchants service,
that they will not serve on board the ships of
war, unless they are forced to do it?</P>
<P>What is the reason, that in order to supply
our Colonies▪ and Plantations with people, be∣sides
the encouragement given in those Colo∣nies
to all people that will come there to plant
and to settle, we are obliged to send away thi∣ther
all our petty offenders, and all the crimi∣nals
that we think fit to spare from the Gal∣lows,
besides that we formerly call'd the Kid∣napping
trade, that is to say, the arts made use
of to wheedle and draw away young vagrant
and indigent people; and people of desperate
fortunes, to sell themselves, that is, bind them∣selves
for servants, the numbers of which are
very great.</P>
<P>IT is poverty fills armies, mans navies, and
peoples Colonies: In vain the drums beat for
soldiers, and the King's captains invite seamen to
serve in the armies for 5 <HI>d.</HI> a day, and in the
royal navy for 23 <HI>s. per</HI> month, in a country
where the ordinary Labourer can have 9 <HI>s.</HI> a
week for his labour, and the manufacturers
earn from is to 16<HI>s.</HI> a week for their work;
and while trade gives 30 <HI>s. per</HI> month wages to
the seamen on board merchant ships: Men will
always stay or go, as the pay gives them encou∣ragement;
and this is the reason why it has
been so much more difficult to raise and recruit
armies in <HI>England,</HI> than it has been in <HI>Scotland</HI>
and <HI>Ireland, France</HI> and <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>THE same trade that keeps our people at
home, is the cause of the well living of the
<PB N="386" REF="407"/>
people here; for as frugality is not the national
virtue of <HI>England,</HI> so the people that get much
spend much; and as they work hard, so they
live well, eat and drink well, cloath warm,
and lodge soft; in a word, the working ma∣nufacturing
people of <HI>England</HI> eat the fat, and
drink the sweet, live better, and fare better,
than the working poor of any other nation in
<HI>Europe;</HI> they make better wages of their work,
and spend more of the money upon their Backs
and Bellies, than in any other country: This
expence of the Poor, as it causes a prodigious
consumption both of the provisions and of the
manufactures of our country at home, so two
things are undeniably the consequence of that
part.</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. THE consumption of provisions en∣creases
the rent and value of the lands, and
this raises the Gentlemens estates, and that
again encreases the employment of people,
and consequently the numbers of them, as
well those who are employ'd in the husban∣dry
of land, breeding and feeding of cattle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
as of servants in the Gentlemens families, who
as their estates encrease in value, so they en∣crease
their families and equipages.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. As the people get greater wages, so
they, I mean the same poorer part of the
people, clothe better, and furnish better,
and this encreases the consumption of the ve∣ry
manufactures they make; then that con∣sumption
encreases the quantity made, and this
creates what we call <HI>Inland trade,</HI> by which
<PB N="387" REF="408"/>
innumerable families are employ'd, and the
increase of the people maintain'd; and by
which encrease of trade and people the pre∣sent
growing prosperity of this nation is pro∣duced.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>THE whole glory and greatness of <HI>England</HI>
then being thus rais'd by trade, it must be un∣accountable
folly and ignorance in us to lessen
that one article in our own esteem, which is
the only fountain from whence we all, <HI>take us
as a nation,</HI> are raised, and by which we are
enriched and maintained. The Scripture says,
speaking of the riches and glory of the city of
<HI>Tyre,</HI> which was indeed at that time the great
<HI>Port</HI> or <HI>Emporium</HI> of the world for foreign
commerce, from whence all the silks and fine
manufactures of <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>India</HI> were exported
all over the <HI>Western</HI> world, that <HI>her Merchants</HI>
were <HI>Princes;</HI> and in another place, <HI>By thy
traffick thou hast encreased thy riches,</HI> Ezek.
xxviii. 5. Certain it is, that our traffick has
encreased our riches; and 'tis also certain, that
the flourishing of our manufactures is the foun∣dation
of all our traffick, as well our merchan∣dize
as our inland trade.</P>
<P>THE Inland trade of <HI>England</HI> is a thing not
easily described; it would, in a word, take up
a whole book by it self; it is the foundation of
all our wealth and greatness; it is the support
of all our foreign trade, and of our manufac∣turing,
and, as I have hitherto written, of the
tradesmen who carry it on; I shall proceed with
a brief discourse of the trade it self.</P>

Magnitude, and the great Advantage
it is to the Nation in general.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> HAVE in a few words describ'd what I
mean by the Inland trade of <HI>England,</HI>
in the introduction to this work; It is
the circulation of commerce among our selves.</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>I. FOR the carrying on our manufactures of
several kinds in the several counties where
they are made, and the employing the seve∣ral
sorts of people and trades needful for the
said manufactures.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. FOR the raising and vending provisions
of all kinds for the supply of the vast num∣bers
of people who are employ'd every where
by the said manufactures.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. FOR the importing and bringing in from
abroad all kinds of foreign growth and ma∣nufactures
which we want.</ITEM>
<PB N="389" REF="410"/>
<ITEM>IV. FOR the carrying about and dispersing,
as well our own growth and manufactures as
the foreign imported growth and manufactures
of other nations to the retailer, and by them
to the last consumer; which is the utmost end
of all Trade; and this in every part, to the ut∣most
corner of the island of <HI>Great Britain</HI>
and <HI>Ireland.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>THIS I call <HI>Inland Trade,</HI> and these Circula∣tors
of goods, and Retailers of them to the last
consumer, are those whom we are to understand
by the word Tradesmen, in all the parts of this
work; for, (as I observed in the beginning) the
plowmen and farmers who labour at home,
and the merchant who imports our merchandize
from abroad, are nott all all meant or included;
and whatever I have been saying, except where
they have been mentioned in particular and at
length.</P>
<P>THIS Inland trade is in it self at this time
the wonder of all the world of trade, nor is
there any thing like it now in the world, much
less that exceeds it, or perhaps ever will be, ex∣cept
only what it self may grow up to in the
ages to come; for, as I have said on all occasi∣ons,
it is still growing and encreasing.</P>
<P>BY this prodigy of a trade all the vast impor∣tation
from our own Colonies is circulated, and
disperst to the remotest corner of the Island,
whereby the consumption is become so great,
and by which those Colonies are so encreased,
and are become so populous and so wealthy as
<PB N="390" REF="411"/>
I have already observed of them: This impor∣tation,
consists chiefly of Sugars and Tobacco;
of which the consumption in <HI>Great Britain</HI> is
scarcely to be conceived of, besides the con∣sumption
of Cotton, Indico, Rice, Ginger,
Piemento or <HI>Jamaica</HI> Pepper, Cocoa or Cho∣colate,
Rum and Melasses; Train-Oil, Salt-Fish,
Whale-Fin, all sorts of Furs, abundance of va∣luable
Drugs, Pitch, Tar, Turpentine, Deals,
Masts and Timber, and many other things of
smaller value; all which, besides the employing
a very great number of ships, and <HI>English</HI> sea∣men,
occasion again a very great exportation of
our own manufactures of all sorts, to those Co∣lonies;
which being circulated again for con∣sumption
there, that circulation is to be account∣ed
a branch of home or inland trade, as those
Colonies are on all such occasions esteemed as a
branch or part of our selves, and of the <HI>British</HI>
Government in the world.</P>
<P>THIS trade to our <HI>West Indies,</HI> and <HI>Ameri∣can</HI>
Colonies, is very considerable, as it em∣ploys
so many ships and sailors, and so much
of the growth of those Colonies is again ex∣ported
by us to other parts of the world, over
and above what is consumed among us at home;
and also as all those goods, and a great deal of
money in specie, is return'd hither for and in
ballance of our own manufactures and merchan∣dizes
exported thither; on these accounts some
have insisted that more real wealth is brought
into <HI>Great Britain</HI> every year from those Co∣lonies,
than is brought from the <HI>Spanish West
Indies</HI> to <HI>Old Spain,</HI> notwithstanding the extent
<PB N="391" REF="412"/>
of their dominion is above twenty times as
much; and notwithstanding the vast quantity
of gold and silver which they bring from the
mines of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and the mountains of <HI>Potosi.</HI></P>
<P>WHETHER these people say true or no, is not
my business to enquire here; tho' if I may give
my opinion, I must acknowledge that I believe
they do; but be it so or not, 'tis certain that it
is an infinitely extended trade, and daily en∣creasing;
and much of it, if not all, is and
ought to be esteemed as an Inland trade, because,
as above, it is a circulation among our selves.</P>
<P>As the manufactures of <HI>England,</HI> particularly
those of <HI>Wool,</HI> (Cotton Wool included} and of
<HI>Silk,</HI> are the greatest, and amount to the great∣est
value of any single manufacture in <HI>Europe,</HI>
so they not only employ more people, but
those people gain the most money, that is
to say, have the best wages for their work,
of any people in the world; and yet, which is
a peculiar to <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> manufactures
are, allowing for their goodness, the cheapest
at market of any in the world too; even <HI>France</HI>
itself, after all the pains they are at to get our
<HI>Wool,</HI> and all the expence they have been at to
imitate our manufactures, by getting over our
workmen, and giving them even greater wages
than they had here, have yet made so little
proficiency in it, and are so far from out-sel∣ling
us in foreign markets, that they still, in
spight of the strictest prohibitions, send hither,
and to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> for <HI>English</HI> Broad-cloths,
Druggets, Duroys, Flannels, Sayes, and seve∣ral
other sorts of our goods, to supply their own.
<PB N="392" REF="413"/>
Nor can they cloath themselves to their satisfac∣tion
with their own goods; but if any <HI>French</HI>
Gentleman of quality comes over hither from
<HI>France,</HI> he is sure to bring no more coats with
him than backs, but immediately to make him
new cloaths as soon as he arrives, and to carry
as many new suits home with him at his return,
as he can get leave to bring ashore when he
comes there; a demonstration that our manu∣facture
exceeds theirs, after all their boasts of
it, both in goodness and in cheapness, even by
their own confession: but I am not now to en∣ter
upon the particular manufactures, but the
general trade in the manufacture; this particular
being a trade of such a magnitude, it is to be
observed for our purpose, that the greatness of
it consists of two parts:</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. THE consumption of it at home, including
our own Plantations and Factories.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THE exportation of it to foreign parts,
exclusive of the said Plantations and Fac∣tories.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>IT is the first of these which is the subject of
my present discourse, because the Tradesmen to
whom, and for whose instruction these letters
are design'd, are the people principally concern∣ed
in the making all these manufactures, and
wholly and solely concerned in dispersing and
circulating them for the home consumption;
and this, with some additions, as explained a∣bove,
I call <HI>Inland Trade.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="414"/>
THE home consumption of our own goods,
as it is very great, so it has one particular cir∣cumstance
attending it, which exceedingly en∣creases
it as a trade, and that is, that besides
the numbers of people which it employs in the
raising the materials, and making the goods
themselves as a manufacture; I say, besides all
this, there are multitudes of people employ'd,
cattle maintain'd, with waggons and carts for
the service on shore, barges and boats for car∣riage
in the rivers, and ships and barks for car∣rying
by sea, and all for the circulating these
manufactures from one place to another, for the
consumption of them among the people.</P>
<P>SO that in short, the circulation of the goods
is a business not equal indeed, but bearing a very
great proportion to the Trade it self.</P>
<P>THIS is owing to another particular circum∣stance
of our manufacture, and perhaps is not
so remarkably the case of any other manufac∣ture
or country in <HI>Europe,</HI> namely, that tho' all
our manufactures are used and called for by al∣most
all the people, and that in every part of
the whole <HI>British</HI> dominion; yet they are made
and wrought in their several distinct and re∣spective
Counties in <HI>Britain,</HI> and some of them
at the remotest distance from one another, hard∣ly
any two manufactures being made in one
place. <HI>For example:</HI></P>
<Q><P>THE <HI>Broad Cloth</HI> and <HI>Druggets</HI> in <HI>Wilts,
Gloucester,</HI> and <HI>Worcestershire.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Serges</HI> in <HI>Devon</HI> and <HI>Somersetshire.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Narrow Cloths</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire</HI> and <HI>Stafford∣shire.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="415"/>
THE <HI>Kerseys, Cottons, Half-Thicks, Duf∣fields,
Plains,</HI> and courser things, in <HI>Lan∣cashire</HI>
and <HI>Westmoreland.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Shalloons</HI> in the counties of <HI>Northamp∣ton,
Berks, Oxford, Southampton,</HI> and <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Womens-stuffs</HI> in <HI>Norfolk.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Linsey-Woolseys, &amp;c.</HI> at <HI>Kidderminster.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Dimmeties</HI> and <HI>Cotton-wares</HI> at <HI>Man∣chester.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Flannels</HI> at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and in <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Tammeys</HI> at <HI>Coventry,</HI> and the like.</P></Q>
<P>IT is the same, in some respects, with our
provisions, especially for the supply of the city
of <HI>London,</HI> and also of several other parts; for
example,</P>
<P>WHEN I speak of provisions, I mean such as
is not made use of in the county where it is
made and produc'd; for example,</P>
<Q><P><HI>Butter</HI> in sirkins in <HI>Suffolk</HI> and <HI>Yorkshire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cheese</HI> from <HI>Cheshire, Wiltshire, Warwick∣shire,</HI>
and <HI>Gloucestershire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Herrings</HI> cur'd Red from <HI>Yarmouth</HI> in <HI>Nor∣folk.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Coals</HI> for fewel from <HI>Northumberland</HI> and
<HI>Durham.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Malt</HI> from the counties of <HI>Hertford, Essex,
Kent, Bucks, Oxford, Berks, &amp;c.</HI></P></Q>
<P>AND thus of many other things which are
the proper produce of one part of the country
only, but are from thence dispers'd for the or∣dinary
use of the people into many, or perhaps
<PB N="395" REF="416"/>
into all the other counties of <HI>England,</HI> to the
infinite advantage of our inland-commerce, and
employing a vast number of people and cattle;
and consequently those people and cattle en∣creasing
the consumption of provisions and fo∣rage,
and the improvement of lands; so true it
is, and so visible, that trade encreases people,
and people encrease trade.</P>
<P>THIS carriage of goods in <HI>England</HI> from those
places is chiefly manag'd by horses and waggons;
the number of which is not to be guess'd at,
nor is there any rule or art that can be thought
of, by which any just calculation can be made
of it, and therefore I shall not enter upon any
particular of it at this time; it is sufficient to
say what I believe to be true, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is
equal to the whole trade of some nations, and
the rather, because of the great improvement
of land, which proceeds from the employing so
many thousands of horses, as are furnish'd for
this part of business.</P>
<P>IN other countries, and indeed in most coun∣tries
in <HI>Europe,</HI> all their inland-trade, such as it
is, is carried on by the convenience of naviga∣tion,
either by coastings on the sea, or by river-navigation:
It is true, our coasting trade is ex∣ceeding
great, and employs a prodigious num∣ber
of ships, as well from all the shores of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
to <HI>London,</HI> as from one Port to another.</P>
<P>BUT as to our river-navigation, it is not e∣qual
to it, tho' in some places it is very great
too; but we have but a very few navigable ri∣vers
in <HI>England,</HI> compar'd with those of other
countries; nor are many of those rivers we have
<PB N="396" REF="417"/>
navigable to any considerable length from the
sea; the most considerable rivers in <HI>England</HI>
for navigation are as follow:
<LIST>
<ITEM>The <HI>Thames.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Trent.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Severn.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Wye.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Ouse.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Humber.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Air,</HI> and</ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Calder.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<Q>[These are navigable a considerable way, and
receive several other navigable rivers into
them; but except these there are very few
rivers in <HI>England</HI> which are navigable much
above the first town of note within their
mouth.]</Q></P>
<P>MOST of our other greatest and most naviga∣ble
rivers are navigable but a very little way in;
as the Northern <HI>Ouse</HI> but to <HI>York,</HI> the <HI>Orwell</HI>
but to <HI>Ipswich,</HI> the <HI>Yare</HI> but to <HI>Norwich;</HI> the
<HI>Tyne</HI> itself but a very little above <HI>Newcastle,</HI>
not in all above twelve miles; the <HI>Tweed</HI> not
at all above <HI>Berwick;</HI> the Great <HI>Avon</HI> but to
<HI>Bristol;</HI> the <HI>Exe</HI> but to <HI>Excester;</HI> and the <HI>Dee</HI>
but to <HI>Chester;</HI> in a word, our river-navigation
is not to be nam'd for carriage, with the vast
bulk of carriage by pack-horses and by wag∣gons;
nor must the carriage by Pedlars on their
backs be omitted.</P>
<P>THIS carriage is the medium of our inland
trade, and, as I said, is a branch of the trade
itself: This great carriage is occasion'd by the
situation of our produce and manufactures; for
example,</P>
<Q><PB N="397" REF="418"/>
<P>THE <HI>Taunton</HI> and <HI>Excester</HI> Serges, Perpetuana's,
and Dueroys come chiefly by land.</P>
<P>THE Clothing, such as the Broad-Cloth and
Druggets from <HI>Wilts, Gloucester, Worcester,</HI>
and <HI>Shropshire,</HI> comes all by land-carriage
to <HI>London,</HI> and goes down again by land-carriages
to all parts of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Yorkshire</HI> Clothing trade, the <HI>Manchester</HI>
and <HI>Coventry</HI> trades, all by land, not to
<HI>London</HI> only, but to all parts of <HI>England,</HI>
by Horse-packs, the <HI>Manchester</HI> men being,
saving their wealth, a kind of <HI>Pedlars,</HI>
who carry their goods themselves to the
country shop-keepers every where, as do
now the <HI>Yorkshire</HI> and <HI>Coventry</HI> manufa∣cturers
also.</P></Q>
<P>NOW in all these manufactures, however re∣mote
from one another, every town in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
uses something, not only of one, or other,
but of all the rest; every sort of goods is want∣ed
every where; and where they make one sort
of goods, and sell them all over <HI>England,</HI> they
at the same time want other goods from almost
every other part; for example,</P>
<P><HI>Norwich</HI> makes chiefly Woollen Stuffs and
Camblets, and these are sold all over <HI>England;</HI>
but then <HI>Norwich</HI> buys Broad-cloth from <HI>Wilts</HI>
and <HI>Worcestershire,</HI> Serges and Sagathies from
<HI>Devon</HI> and <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> Narrow Cloth from
<HI>Yorkshire,</HI> Flannel from <HI>Wales,</HI> Coals from
<HI>Newcastle,</HI> and the like; and so it is, <HI>mutatis
mutandis,</HI> of most of the other parts.</P>
<P><PB N="398" REF="419"/>
THE circulating of these goods, in this man∣ner,
is the life of our inland-trade, and encrea∣ses
the numbers of our people, by keeping them
employ'd at home, and indeed of late they are
prodigiously multiplied; and they again encrease
our trade, as shall be mentioned in its place.</P>
<P>As the demand for all sorts of <HI>English</HI> goods is
thus great, and they are thus extended in every
part of the island, so the tradesmen are disperst
and spread over every part also; <HI>that is to say,</HI>
in every town, great or little, we find shop-keep∣ers
wholesale or retale, who are concern'd in
this circulation, and hand forward the goods
to the last Consumer: From <HI>London</HI> the goods
go chiefly to the great Towns, and from those
again to the smaller markets, and from those to
the meanest villages; so that all the manufactures
of <HI>England,</HI> and most of them also of foreign
countries, are to be found in the meanest vil∣lage,
and in the remotest corner of the whole
island of <HI>Britain,</HI> and are to be bought, as it
were, at every body's door.</P>
<P>THIS shews not the extent of our manufa∣ctures
only, but the usefulness of them, and how
they are so necessary to mankind, that our own
people cannot be without them, and every sort
of them, and cannot make one thing serve for
another; but as they sell their own, so they
buy from others, and <HI>every body</HI> here trades
with <HI>every body;</HI> this it is that gives the whole
manufacture so universal a circulation, and makes
it so immensely great in <HI>England:</HI> What it
is abroad is not so much to our present pur∣pose.</P>
<P><PB N="399" REF="420"/>
AGAIN, the magnitude of the city of <HI>London</HI>
adds very considerably to the greatness of the
inland-trade; for as this city is the center of our
trade, so all the manufactures are brought hither,
and from hence circulated again to all the coun∣try,
as they are particularly called for; but that
is not all; the magnitude of the city influences
the whole nation also in the article of provisions,
and something is rais'd in every county in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
however remote, for the supply of <HI>Lon∣don;</HI>
nay, all the best of every produce is brought
hither; so that all the people, and all the lands
in <HI>England,</HI> seem to be at work for, or em∣ploy'd
by, or on the account of this over-grown
city.</P>
<P>THIS makes the trade encrease prodigiously,
even as the city itself encreases; and we all
know the city is very greatly encreased within
few years past: Again, as the whole nation
is employ'd to feed and cloath this city, so here
is the money, by which all the people in the
whole nation seem to be supported and main∣tain'd.</P>
<P>I have endeavour'd to make some calculation
of the number of shop-keepers in this kingdom,
but I find it is not to be done; we may as well
count the stars; not that they are equal in num∣ber
neither, but it is as impossible, unless any
one person corresponded so as to have them
numbred in every town, or parish, throughout
the kingdom; I doubt not they are some hun∣dreds
of thousands, but there is no making an
estimate; the number is in a manner infinite;
It is as impossible likewise to make any guess
<PB N="400" REF="421"/>
at the bulk of their trade, and how much they
return yearly; nor, if we could, would it give
any foundation for any just calculation of the
value of goods in general, because all our goods
circulate so much, and go so often thro' so ma∣ny
hands before they come to the consumer:
This so often passing every sort of goods thro'
so many hands, before it comes into the hands
of the last consumer, is that which makes our
trade be so immensely great; for example, if
there is made in <HI>England</HI> for our home-con∣sumption
the value of one hundred thousand
pounds worth of any particular goods, <HI>say for
example</HI> that it be so many pieces of Serge or
Cloth, and if this goes through ten tradesmens
hands, before it comes to the last consumer,
then there is ten hundred thousand pounds re∣turn'd
in trade for that one hundred thousand
pounds worth of goods; and so of all the sorts
of goods we trade in.</P>
<P>AGAIN, as I said above, all our manufactures
are so useful to, and depend on one another so
much in trade, that the sale of one necessarily
causes the demand of the other, in all parts;
for example, suppose the poorest Country-man
wants to be cloathed, or suppose it be a Gen∣tleman
wants to cloath one of his servants,
whether a footman in a livery, or suppose it be
any servant in ordinary apparel, yet he shall in
some part employ almost every one of the ma∣nufacturing
counties of <HI>England,</HI> for making
up one ordinary suit of cloaths; for example,</P>
<Q><P>IF his Coat be of Woollen Cloth, he has
that from <HI>Yorkshire.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="422"/>
THE Lining is Shalloon from <HI>Berkshire.</HI></P>
<P>THE Wastcoat is of Callamancoe from <HI>Nor∣wich.</HI></P>
<P>THE Breeches of a strong Drugget from the
<HI>Devizes, Wiltshire.</HI></P>
<P>THE Stockings being of Yarn from <HI>Westmore∣land.</HI></P>
<P>THE Hat is a Felt from <HI>Leicester.</HI></P>
<P>THE Gloves of Leather from <HI>Somersetshie.</HI></P>
<P>THE Shoes from <HI>Northampton.</HI></P>
<P>THE Buttons from <HI>Macclesfield</HI> in <HI>Cheshire;</HI>
or, if they are of Metal, they come from
<HI>Birmingham,</HI> or <HI>Warwickshire.</HI></P>
<P>HIS Garters from <HI>Manchester.</HI></P>
<P>HIS shirt of home-made Linen of <HI>Lancashire,</HI>
or <HI>Scotland.</HI></P></Q>
<P>IF it be thus of every poor man's cloathing,
or of a servant, what must it be of the master,
and of the rest of the family? and in this par∣ticular
the case is the same, let the family live
where they will; so that all these manufactures
must be found in all the remotest towns and
counties in <HI>England,</HI> be it where you will.</P>
<P>AGAIN, take the furnishing of our houses, it
is the same in proportion, and according to
the figure and quality of the person; suppose
then it be a middling tradesman, that is going
to live in some market-town, and to open his
shop there; suppose him not to deal in the ma∣nufacture,
but in Grocery, and such sort of wares
as the Country-Grocers sell.</P>
<P>THIS man however must cloath himself and
his wife, and must furnish his house; let us see
<PB N="402" REF="423"/>
then to how many counties and towns, among
our manufactures, must he send for his needful
supply; nor is the quantity concern'd in it; let
him furnish himself as frugally as he pleases,
yet he must have something of every necessary
thing; and we will suppose for the present pur∣pose
the man liv'd in <HI>Sussex,</HI> where very few,
if any manufactures are carried on; suppose he
liv'd at <HI>Horsham,</HI> which is a Market-town in or
near the middle of the county.</P>
<P>FOR his cloathing of himself, for we must al∣low
him to have a new suit of cloaths, when
he begins the world, take them to be just as a∣bove;
for as to the quality, or quantity, 'tis
much the same; only, that instead of buying
the cloth from <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> perhaps he has it a lit∣tle
finer than the poor man above, and so his
comes out of <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> and his Stockings are,
it may be, of Worsted, not of Yarn, and so
they come from <HI>Nottingham,</HI> not <HI>Westmoreland:</HI>
But this does not at all alter the case.</P>
<P>COME we next to his wife; and she being
a good honest townsman's daughter, is not dres∣sed
over fine, yet she must have something de∣cent,
being new married too, and especially as
times go, when the Burghers wives of <HI>Horsham,</HI>
or any other town, go as fine as they do in
other places; allow her then to have a silk gown,
with all the necessaries belonging to a middling
tolerable appearance, yet you shall find all the
nation more or less concern'd in cloathing this
Country-Grocer's wife, and furnishing his house,
and yet nothing at all extravagant; for ex∣ample,</P>

and <HI>Kent.</HI></P>
<P>GLASS Ware from <HI>Sturbridge</HI> in <HI>Worcester∣shire,</HI>
and <HI>London.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>I give this list to explain what I said before;
namely, that there is no particular place in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
where all the manufactures are made, but
<PB N="405" REF="426"/>
every county or place has its peculiar sort, or
particular manufacture, in which the people are
wholly employ'd; and for all the rest that is
wanted, they fetch them from other parts.</P>
<P>BUT then, as what is thus wanted by every
particular person, or family, is but in small
quantities, and they would not be able to send
for it to the country, or town, where it is to be
bought; there are shop-keepers in every village,
or at least in every considerable market-town,
where the particulars are to be bought; and
who find it worth their while to furnish them∣selves
with Quantities of all the particular goods,
be they made where and as far off as they will;
and at these shops the people, who want them,
are easily supplied.</P>
<P>NOR do even these shop-keepers go or send
to all the several countries, where those goods
are made, that is to say, to this part for the
<HI>Cloth,</HI> or to that for the <HI>Lining;</HI> to another
for the <HI>Buttons,</HI> and to another for the <HI>Thread;</HI>
but they again correspond with the wholesale-dealers
in <HI>London,</HI> where there are particular
shops or warehouses for all these; and they not
only furnish the country shop-keepers, but give
them large credit, and sell them great quantities
of goods, by which they again are enabled to
trust the Taylors, who make the cloaths, or e∣ven
their neighbours, who wear them; and the
Manufacturers in the several counties do the
like by those Wholesale dealers, who supply the
country shops.</P>
<P>THRO' so many hands do all the necessary
things pass for the cloathing a poor plain coun∣try-man,
<PB N="406" REF="427"/>
tho' he liv'd as far as <HI>Berwick</HI> upon
<HI>Tweed;</HI> and this occasions, as I have said, a ge∣neral
circulation of trade, both to and from
<HI>London,</HI> from and to all the parts of <HI>England,</HI>
so that every manufacture is sold and remov'd
five or six times, and <HI>perhaps more,</HI> before it
comes to the last consumer.</P>
<P>THIS method of trade brings another arti∣cle
in, which also is the great foundation of
the encrease of Commerce; and the prodigious
magnitude of our Inland-trade is much owing
to it, and that is giving credit, by which every
tradesman is enabled to trade for a great deal
more than he otherwise could do. By this
method a shop-keeper is able to stock his shop,
or warehouses, with two or three times as much
goods in value, as he has stock of his own to
begin the world with; and by that means is a∣ble
to trust out his goods to others, and give
them time, and so under one another; nay, I
may say, many a tradesman begins the world
with borrow'd stocks, or with no stock at all,
but that of Credit, and yet carries on a trade
for several hundreds, nay, for several thousands
of pounds a year.</P>
<P>BY this means the trade in general is infi∣nitely
encreased; nay, the stock of the king∣dom
in trade is doubled, or trebled, or more;
and there is infinitely more business carried
on, than the real stock could be able to ma∣nage,
if no credit was to be given; for cre∣dit
in this particular is a stock, and that not an
imaginary, but a real stock; for the tradesman,
that perhaps begins but with five hundred, or one
<PB N="407" REF="428"/>
thousand pounds stock, shall be able to furnish
or stock his shop with four times the sum in
the value of goods; and as he gives credit a∣gain,
and trusts other tradesmen under him, so
he launches out into a trade of a great magni∣tude;
and yet if he is a prudent manager of
his business, he finds himself able to answer his
payments, and so continually supply himself
with goods, keeping up the reputation of his
dealings, and the credit of his shop, tho' his
stock be not a fifth, nay, sometimes not a tenth
part, in proportion to the returns that he makes
by the year; so that credit is the foundation,
on which the trade of <HI>England</HI> is made so con∣siderable.</P>
<P>NOR is it enough to say, that people must
and will have goods, and that the consump∣tion
is the same; it is evident, that consump∣tion
is not the same; and in those nations
where they give no credit, or not so much as
here, the trade is small in proportion, as I shall
shew in its place.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Credit in Trade, and how a Trades∣man
ought to value and improve it:
How easily lost, and how hard it is to
be recover'd.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>REDIT is, or ought to be the trades∣man's
<HI>Mistress;</HI> but I must tell him
too, he must not think of ever cast∣ing
her off; for if once he loses her,
she hardly ever returns; and yet she has one qua∣lity,
in which she differs from most of the La∣dies,
which go by that name; if you court her,
she is gone, if you manage so wisely, as to
make her believe you really do not want her,
she follows and courts you: But by the way no
Tradesman can be in so good circumstances, as
to say he does not want, that is, does not stand
in need of credit.</P>
<P>CREDIT, next to real stock, is the foundation,
the life and soul of business in a private trades∣man;
it is his prosperity; 'tis his support in
the substance of his whole trade; even in pub∣lick
matters 'tis the strength and fund of a na∣tion:
we felt in the late wars the consequence
<PB N="409" REF="430"/>
of both the extremes, <HI>viz.</HI> of wanting and of
enjoying a compleat fund of credit.</P>
<P>CREDIT makes war, and makes peace; raises
armies, fits out navies, fights battles, besieges
towns; and, in a word, it is more justly call'd
the sinews of war, than the money itself; be∣cause
it can do all these things without money;
nay, it will bring in money to be subservient,
tho' it be independent.</P>
<P>CREDIT makes the soldier fight without pay,
the armies march without provisions, and it
makes tradesmen keep open shop without stock;
the force of credit is not to be describ'd by
words; it is an impregnable fortification, either
for a nation, or for a single man in business;
and he that has credit is invulnerable, whether
he has money, or no: Nay, it will make mo∣ney,
and, which is yet more, it will make mo∣ney
without an intrinsick, without the <HI>materia
medica,</HI> (as the Doctors have it;) it adds a va∣lue,
and supports whatever value it adds, to the
meanest substance; it makes paper pass for mo∣ney,
and fills the Exchequer and the Banks with
as many millions as it pleases, upon demand.</P>
<P>AS I said in my last, it encreases commerce,
so I may add, it makes trade and makes the
whole kingdom trade for many millions more,
than the national species can amount to.</P>
<P>IT may be true, as some alledge, that we can∣not
drive a trade for more goods than we have
to trade, with; but then 'tis as true, that it
is by the help of credit that we can encrease the
quantity, and that more goods are made to trade
with, than would otherwise be; more goods
<PB N="410" REF="431"/>
are brought to market, than they could otherwise
sell; and even in the last consumption how ma∣ny
thousands of families wear out their cloaths
before they pay for them, and eat their dinner
upon tick with the Butcher? nay, how many thou∣sands,
who could not buy any cloaths, if they
were to pay for them in ready money, yet buy
them at a venture upon their credit, and pay
for them, as they can?</P>
<P>Trade is anticipated by Credit, and it grows by
the anticipation; for men often buy cloaths before
they pay for them, because they want cloaths before
they can spare the money; and these are
to many in number, that really they add a great
stroke to the bulk of our Inland trade: How
many families have we in <HI>England</HI> that live up∣on
credit, even to the tune of two or three years
rent of their revenue, before it comes in? so
that they may be said to <HI>eat the Calf in the
Cow's belly:</HI> This encroachment they make up∣on
the stock in trade; and even this very article
may state the case: I doubt not but at this time
the land owes to the trade some millions ster∣ling;
that is to say, the Gentlemen owe to the
Tradesmen so much money, which at long run
the rents of their lands must pay.</P>
<P>The Tradesmen having then trusted the land∣ed
men with so much, where must they have it
but by giving credit also to one another? trusting
their goods and money into trade, one launch∣ing
out into the hands of another, and forbear∣ing
payment 'till the lands make it good out of
their produce, that is to say, out of their Rents.</P>
<P><PB N="411" REF="432"/>
THE Trade is not limited; the produce of
lands may and is restrain'd; Trade cannot exceed
the bounds of the goods it can sell; but while
trade can encrease its stock of cash by credit, it
can encrease its stock of goods for sale, and
then it has nothing to do, but to find a market
to sell at; and this we have done in all parts
of the world, still by the force of our stocks be∣ing
so encreas'd.</P>
<P>THUS Credit raising stock at home, that stock
enables us to give credit abroad; and thus the
quantity of goods, which we make, and which
is infinitely encreased at home, enables us to
find or force a vent abroad: This is apparent,
our home trade having so far encreas'd our ma∣nufacture,
that <HI>England</HI> may be said to be able
almost to clothe the whole world; and in our
carrying on the foreign trade wholly upon the
<HI>English</HI> stocks, giving credit to almost all the
nations of the world; for 'tis evident, our stocks
lie at this time upon credit in the warehouses
of the merchants in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal, Hol∣land</HI>
and <HI>Germany, Italy</HI> and <HI>Turky;</HI> nay, in
<HI>New Spain</HI> and <HI>Brasil.</HI></P>
<P>THE exceeding quantity of goods thus rais'd
in <HI>England</HI> cannot be suppos'd to be the mere
product of the solid wealth and stocks of the
<HI>English</HI> people; we do not pretend to it; the
joining those stocks to the value of goods always
appearing in <HI>England,</HI> in the hands of the manu∣cturers,
tradesmen, and merchants, and to the
wealth which appears in shipping, in stock upon
land, and in the current coin of the nation,
would amount to such a prodigy of stock, as
not all <HI>Europe</HI> could pretend to.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="433"/>
BUT all this is owing to the prodigious thing
call'd Credit, the extent of which in the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI>
trade is as hard to be valued, as the benefit
of it to <HI>England</HI> is really not to be described.
It must be likewise said, to the honour of our
<HI>English</HI> tradesmen, that they understand how to
manage the credit they both give and take, bet∣ter
than any other tradesmen in the world; in∣deed
they have a greater opportunity to im∣prove
it, and make use of it, and therefore may
be supposed to be more ready in making the
best of their credit, than any other Nations are.</P>
<P>HENCE it is that we frequently find Tradesmen
carrying on a prodigious trade with but a mid∣dling
stock of their own, the rest being all ma∣naged
by the force of their credit, for example,
I have known a man in a private warehouse in
<HI>London</HI> trade for forty thousand pounds a year
sterling, and carry on such a return for many
years together, and not have one thousand
pound stock of his own, or not more; all the
rest has been carried on upon credit, being the
stocks of other men running continually thro'
his hands: And this is not practised now and
then, as a great rarity, but is very frequent in
trade, and may be seen every day, as what in
its degree runs thro' the whole body of the
tradesmen in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>EVERY tradesman both gives and takes credit,
and the new mode of setting it up over their
shop and warehouse doors, in capital letters,
<HI>NO TRUST BY RETAIL,</HI> is a pre∣sumption
in trade; and tho' it may have been
attempted in some trades, was never yet brought to
<PB N="413" REF="434"/>
any perfection; and most of those trades, who
were the forwardest to set it up, have been ob∣liged
to take it down again, or act contrary to
it in their business; Or see some very good cus∣tomers
go away from them to other shops, who
tho' they have not brought money with them,
have yet good foundations to make any trades∣men
trust them, and who do at proper times
make payments punctual enough.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, instead of giving no trust
by retail, we see very considerable families who
buy nothing but on trust; even Bread, Beer,
Butter, Cheese, Beef and Mutton, Wine, Gro∣cery,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> being the things which even with the
meanest families are generally sold for ready
money. Thus I have known a family, whose re∣venue
has been some thousands a year, pay
their Butcher, and Baker, and Grocer, and
Cheesemonger, by a hundred pounds at a time,
and be generally a hundred more in each of their
debts, and yet the Tradesmen have thought
it well worth while to trust them, and their
pay has in the end been very honest and good.</P>
<P>THIS is what I say brings Land so much in
debt to Trade, and obliges the tradesmen to take
credit of one another; and yet they do not lose
by it neither, for the tradesmen find it in the price,
and they take care to make such families pay
warmly for the credit, in the rate of their goods;
nor can it be expected it should be otherwise,
for unless the profit answered it, the tradesman
could not afford to be so long without his
money.</P>
<P><PB N="414" REF="435"/>
THIS credit takes its beginning in our manu∣factures,
even at the very first of the opera∣tion,
for the master manufacturer himself be∣gins
it; Take a country Clothier, or Bay-maker,
or what other maker of goods you please, pro∣vided
he be one that puts out the goods to
the making; it is true that the poor spinners
and weavers cannot trust; the first spin for their
Bread, and the last not only weave for their
Bread, but they have several workmen and
boys under them, who are very poor, and if
they should want their pay on <HI>Saturday</HI> night,
must want their dinner a <HI>Sunday;</HI> and perhaps
would be in danger of starving, with their fa∣milies,
by the next <HI>Saturday.</HI></P>
<P>BUT tho' the Clothier cannot have credit for
spinning and weaving, he buys his Wooll at the
Staplers or Fellmongers, and he gets two or
three months credit for that; he buys his oil
and soap of the country shop-keeper, or has it
sent down from his Factor at <HI>London,</HI> and he
gets longer credit for that, and the like of all
other things; so that a Clothier of any consi∣derable
business, when he comes to die, shall
appear to be four or five thousand pounds in debt.</P>
<P>BUT then look into his books, and you shall find
his Factor at <HI>Blackwel-hall,</HI> who sells his Cloths,
or the Warehouse-keeper who sells his <HI>Dueroys</HI>
and <HI>Druggets,</HI> or both together, have two thou∣sand
pounds worth of goods in hand left un∣sold;
and has trusted out to Drapers and Mer∣cers,
and Merchants, to the value of four thou∣sand
pounds more; and look into his work∣house
at home, <HI>viz.</HI> his wool-lofts, his comb∣ing-shop,
<PB N="415" REF="436"/>
his yarn-chamber, and the like, and
there you will find it; in wooll unspun, and in
yarn spun, and in wooll at the spinners, and in
yarn at and in the looms at the weavers; in
Rape-oil, <HI>Gallipoli</HI>-oil, and perhaps soap, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in
his ware-houses, and in cloths at the fulling-mill,
and in his rowing-shops, finished and unfinish∣ed,
four thousand pounds worth of goods more;
so that tho' this Clothier ow'd five thousand
pounds at his death, he has nevertheless died in
good circumstances, and has five thousand pounds
estate clear to go among his children, all his
debts paid and discharged: However, 'tis evi∣dent,
that at the very beginning of this ma∣nufacturer's
trade, his five thousand pounds stock
is made ten thousand, by the help of his Credit,
and he trades for three times as much in the
year; so that five thousand pound stock makes
ten thousand pound stock and credit, and that
together makes thirty thousand pounds a year
return'd in trade.</P>
<P>WHEN you come from him to the warehouse-keeper
in <HI>London,</HI> there you double and treble
upon it; to an unknown degree; for the <HI>London</HI>
Wholesale-man shall at his death appear to have
credit among the country Clothiers, for ten or
fifteen thousand, nay, to twenty thousand pounds,
and yet have kept up an unspotted credit all his
days.</P>
<P>WHEN he is dead, and his Executors or Wi∣dow
comes to look into things, they are fright∣ed
with the very appearance of such a weight
of debts, and begin to doubt how his estate
will come out at the end of it: But when they
<PB N="416" REF="437"/>
come to cast up his books and his warehouse,
they find
<Q><P>IN debts abroad perhaps thirty thousand
pounds.</P>
<P>IN goods in his warehouse, twelve thousand
pounds;</P></Q>
So that in a word, the man has died immensly
rich; that is to say, worth between twenty and
thirty thousand pounds, only that having been
a long standard in trade, and having a large
stock, he drove a very great business, perhaps
to the tune of sixty to seventy thousand pounds
a year; so that of all the thirty thousand
pounds owing, there may be very little of it
deliver'd above four to six months, and the
debtors being many of them considerable mer∣chants,
and good paymasters, there is no diffi∣culty
in getting in money enough to clear all
his own debts; and the widow and children being
left well, are not in such haste for the rest, but
that it comes in time enough to make them
easy; and at length it all comes in, or with but
a little loss.</P>
<P>As it is thus in great things, 'tis the same in
proportion with small; so that in all the trade
of <HI>England,</HI> you may reckon two thirds of it
carried on upon credit; in which reckoning I
suppose I speak much within compass, for in
some trades there is four parts of five carried
on so; and in some more.</P>
<P>ALL these things serve to shew the infinite
value of which credit is to the tradesman, as
well as to trade it self; and 'tis for this rea∣son
<PB N="417" REF="438"/>
I have closed my instructions with this part
of the discourse: Credit is the choicest jewel the
tradesman is trusted with, 'tis better than money
many ways; if a man has ten thousand pounds
in money, he may certainly trade for ten thou∣sand
pounds, and if he has no credit he cannot
trade for a shilling more.</P>
<P>But how often have we seen men, by the meer
strength of their credit, trade for ten thousand
pounds a year, and have not one groat of real
stock of their own left in the world; nay, I
can say it of my own knowledge, that I have
known a tradesman trade for ten thousand
pounds a year, and carry it on with full credit
to the last gasp, then die and break both at
once; that is to say, die unsuspected, and yet
when his estate has been cast up, appear to be
five thousand pounds worse than nothing in the
world: how he kept up his credit, and made
good his payments so long, is indeed the mys∣tery,
and makes good what I said before, name∣ly,
that as none trade so much upon credit in
the world, so none know so well how to im∣prove
and manage credit to their real advan∣tage,
as the <HI>English</HI> tradesmen do; and we have
many examples of it, among our Bankers espe∣cially,
of when I have not room to enter at
this time into the discourse, tho' it would afford
a great many diverting particulars.</P>
<P>I have mentioned on several occasions in these
letters, how nice and how dainty a dame this
Credit is, how soon she is affronted and disob∣liged,
and how hard to be recovered, when once
distasted and fled; particularly in the story
<PB N="418" REF="439"/>
of the tradesman who told his friends in a pub∣lick
coffee-house that he was broke, and should
shut up his shop the next day: I have hinted
how chary we ought to be of one another's
credit, and that we should take care as much
of our neighbour tradesman's credit as we would
of his life, or as we would of firing his house;
and consequently the whole street.</P>
<P>LET me close all with a word to the trades∣man
himself, that if it be so valuable to him,
and his friends should be all so chary of in∣juring
his reputation, certainly he should be ve∣ry
chary of it himself: The tradesman that is
not as tender of his credit as he is of his eyes,
or of his wife and children, neither deserves cre∣dit,
or will long be master of it.</P>
<P>AS Credit is a coy mistress, and will not easily
be courted, so she is a mighty nice touchy La∣dy,
and is soon affronted; if she is ill used she
flies at once, and 'tis a very doubtful thing whe∣ther
ever you gain her favour again.</P>
<P>SOME may ask me here, How comes it to
pass, since she is so nice and touchy a Lady,
that so many clowns court and carry her, and
so many fools keep her so long? My answer is▪
that those clowns have yet good breeding enough
to treat her civilly; he must be a fool indeed
that will give way to have his credit injur'd,
and sit still and be quiet; that will not bustle
and use his utmost industry to vindicate his
own reputation, and preserve his credit.</P>
<P>BUT the main question for a tradesman in
this case, and which I have not spoken of yet,
is, What is the man to do to preserve his cre∣dit?
<PB N="419" REF="440"/>
What are the methods that a young trades∣man
is to take, to gain a good share of credit
in his beginning, and to preserve and maintain
it when it is gain'd?</P>
<P>EVERY tradesman's credit is suppos'd to be
good at first; he that begins without credit, is
an unhappy wretch of a tradesman indeed, and
may be said to be broke even before he sets
up; for what can a man do, who by any mis∣fortune
in his conduct during his apprenticeship,
or by some ill character upon him so early, be∣gins
with a blast upon his credit? my advice to
such a young man would be, not to set up at
all; or if he did, to stay for some time, till by
some better behaviour, either as a journeyman,
or as an assistant in some other man's shop or
warehouse, he had recover'd himself; or else to
go and let up in some other place or town re∣mote
from that where he has been bred; for
he must have a great assurance that can flatter
himself to set up, and believe he shall recover
a lost reputation.</P>
<P>BUT take a young tradesman as setting up
with the ordinary stock, that is to say, a nega∣tive
character, <HI>viz.</HI> that he has done nothing
to hurt his character, nothing to prejudice his
behaviour, and to give people a suspicion of
him; what then is the first principle on which
to build a tradesman's reputation? and what is
it he is to do?</P>
<P>THE answer is short, two things raise credit
in trade, and I may say they are the only things
requir'd; there are some necessary addenda, but
these are the fundamentals.</P>
<LIST>
<PB N="420" REF="441"/>
<ITEM>1. INDUSTRY.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. HONESTY.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I have dwelt upon the first; the last I have
but a few words to say to, but they will be
very significant; indeed that head requires no
comment, no explanations or enlargements
nothing can support <HI>Credit,</HI> be it publick or
private, but Honesty; a punctual dealing, a ge∣neral
probity in every transaction; he that once
<HI>breaks thro'</HI> his honesty, violates his credit; once
denominate a man <HI>a knave,</HI> and you need not
forbid any man to trust him.</P>
<P>EVEN in the publick it appears to be the
same thing; let any man view the publick cre∣dit
in its present flourishing circumstances, and
compare it with the latter end of the years of
King <HI>Charles</HI> II. after the <HI>Exchequer</HI> had been
shut up, parliamentary appropriations misapplied,
and, in a word, the publick faith broken; who
would lend? seven or eight <HI>per cent.</HI> was given
for anticipations in King <HI>William</HI>'s time, tho'
no new fraud had been offered, only because
the old debts were unpaid; and how hard was
it to get any one to lend money at all?</P>
<P>BUT, after by a long series of just and punc∣tual
dealing, the Parliament making good all
the deficient funds, and paying even those debts
for which no provision was made, and the like,
how is the credit restor'd, the publick faith
made sacred again, and now money flows into
the <HI>Exchequer</HI> without calling for, and that at
3 or 4 <HI>per cent.</HI> interest, even from foreign
<PB N="421" REF="442"/>
countries, as well as from our own people?
They that have credit can never want mo∣ney;
and this credit is to be rais'd by no other
method, whether by private tradesmen, or pub∣lick
bodies of men, by nations and governments,
but by a general probity and an honest punctual
dealing.</P>
<P>THE reason of this case is as plain as the as∣sertion;
the cause is in it self; no man lends
his money but with an expectation of receiving
it again with the interest: If the borrower pays
it punctually without hesitations and defalcati∣ons,
without difficulties, and above all, without
compulsion, what is the consequence? he is
call'd an honest man, he has the reputation of a
punctual fair dealer: And what then? Why
then he may borrow again whenever he will,
he may take up money and goods, or any thing,
upon his bare word, or note; when another
man must give bondsmen, or <HI>mainprize,</HI> that
is, a pawn or pledge for security, and hardly
be trusted so neither. <HI>This is credit.</HI></P>
<P>IT is not the quality of the person would
give credit to his dealing; not Kings, Princes,
Emperors, 'tis all one; nay, a private shop∣keeper
shall borrow money much easier than a
Prince, if the credit of the tradesman has the
reputation of being an honest man: Not the
crown it self can give credit to the head that
wears it, if once he that wears it comes but to
mortgage his honour in the matter of payment
of money.</P>
<P>WHO would have lent King <HI>Charles</HI> II. fifty
pounds on the credit of his word or bond, af∣ter
<PB N="422" REF="443"/>
the shutting up the <HI>Exchequer?</HI> The royal
word was made a jest of, and the character of
the King was esteem'd a fluttering trifle, which
no man would venture upon, much less ven∣ture
his money upon.</P>
<P>IN King <HI>William</HI>'s time the case was much
the same at first; tho' the King had not broken
his credit then with any man, yet how did they
break their faith with the whole world, by the
deficiency of the funds, the giving high and
ruinous interest to men almost as greedy as
vulturs, the causing the government to pay
great and extravagant rates for what they bought,
and great premio's for what they borrowed,
these were the injuries to the publick for want
of credit; nor was it in the power of the whole
nation to remedy it; on the contrary, they
made it still grow worse and worse, till, as a∣bove,
the Parliament recover'd it. And how
was it done? Not but by the same method a pri∣vate
person must do the same, <HI>viz.</HI> by doing
justly, and fairly, and honestly by every body.</P>
<P>THUS credit began to revive, and to enlarge
it self again; and usury, which had as it were
eaten up mankind in business, declin'd, and so
things came to their right way again.</P>
<P>THE case is the same with a tradesman, if he
shuffles in payment, bargains at one time, and
pays at another, breaks his word and his ho∣nour
in the road of his business, he is gone;
no man will take his bills, no man will trust
him.</P>
<P>THE conclusion is open and clear, the trades∣man
cannot be too careful of his credit, he
<PB N="423" REF="444"/>
cannot buy it too dear, or be too careful to
preserve it: it is in vain to maintain it by false
and loose doing business; by breaking faith, re∣fusing
to perform agreements, and such shuf∣fling
things as those; the greatest Monarch in <HI>Eu∣rope
could not so preserve his credit.</HI></P>
<P>NOTHING but probity will support credit;
just and fair, and honourable dealings give cre∣dit,
and nothing but the same just and fair and
honourable dealings will preserve it.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S I said that credit is maintained by just
and honourable dealing, so that just
dealing depends very much upon the
tradesman's punctual payment of mo∣ney
in all the several demands that are upon
him. The ordinary demands of money upon
a tradesman are,</P>
<Q><PB N="424" REF="445"/>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. PROMISES of money for goods bought at
time.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. BILLS drawn upon him; which, generally
speaking, are from the country, that is to
say, from some places remote from where
he lives. Or,</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. PROMISSORY NOTES under his hand,
which are pass'd oftentimes upon buying
goods: bought also at time, as in the first
head.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. BONDS bearing interest, given chiefly for
money borrowed at running interest.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>1. PROMISES of money for goods bought at
time. This indeed is the loosest article in a
tradesman's payments; and it is true that a
tradesman's credit is maintain'd upon the easiest
terms in this case of any other that belongs
to trade; for in this case not one man in twen∣ty
keeps to his time; and so easy are trades∣men
to one another, that in general it is not
much expected, but he that pays tolerably well,
and without <HI>dunning,</HI> is a good man, and in
credit; shall be trusted any where, and keeps
up a character in his business; sometimes he
pays sooner, sometimes later, and is accounted
so good a customer, that tho' he owes a great
deal, yet he shall be trusted any where, and is
as lofty and touchy if his credit be call'd in
question, as if he paid all ready money.</P>
<P><PB N="425" REF="446"/>
AND indeed these men shall often buy their
goods as cheap upon the credit of their ordi∣nary
pay, as another man shall that brings his
money in his hand; and it is reasonable it should
be so, for the <HI>ready-money man</HI> comes and buys
a parcel here, and a parcel there, and comes
but seldom, but the Other comes every day,
that is to say, as often as he wants goods, buys
considerably, perhaps deals for two or three
thousand pounds a year with you, <HI>and the like,</HI>
and pays currently too. Such a customer ought
indeed to be sold as cheap to, as the other
chance customer for his ready money. In this
manner of trade, <HI>I say,</HI> credit is maintain'd up∣on
the easiest terms of any other, and yet here
the tradesman must have a great care to keep it
up too; for tho' it be the easiest article to keep
up credit in, yet even in this article the Trades∣man
may lose his credit, and then he is un∣done
at once; and this is by growing (what in
the language of Trade is call'd) <HI>long-winded,</HI>
putting off and putting off continually, till he
will bear <HI>dunning;</HI> then his credit falls, his
dealer that trusted him perhaps a thousand pound
thick before, that esteemed him as good as rea∣dy
money, now grows sick of him, declines
him, cares not whether he deals with him or
no, and at last refuses to trust him any longer;
Then his credit is quite sunk and gone, and in
a little after that his trade is ruin'd and the
Tradesman too; for he must be the D—of a
tradesman that can open his shop after he has
outliv'd his credit; let him look which way he
will all is lost, no body cares to deal with him;
<PB N="426" REF="447"/>
and which is still worse, no body will trust
him.</P>
<P>1. BILLS drawn upon him from the country;
that is to say, from some places remote from
where he now dwells; it is but a little while
ago since those bills were the loosest things in
trade, for as they could not be protested, so
they would not (in all their heats) always sue for
them, but rather return them to the person
from whom they receiv'd them.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, let the occasion be what
it will, the tradesman ought on all occasions to
pay these notes without a publick recalling and
returning them, and without hesitation of any
kind whatsoever. He that lets his bills lie long
unpaid, must not expect to keep his credit much
after them.</P>
<P>BESIDES, the late law for noting and protest∣ing
Inland bills alters the case very much; Bills
now accepted are protested in form, and if not
punctually paid are either return'd immediately,
or the person on whom they are drawn is liable
to be sued at law; either of which is at best a
blow to the credit of the acceptor.</P>
<P>A tradesman may, without hurt to his repu∣tation,
refuse to accept a bill, for then, when
the notary comes he gives his reasons, <HI>viz.</HI>
that he refuses to accept the bill for want of
advice, or for want of effects in his hands for
account of the drawer, or that he has not given
orders to draw upon him; in all which cases
the non-acceptance touches the credit of the
drawer; for in trade it is always esteemed a dis∣honourable
thing to draw upon any man that
<PB N="427" REF="448"/>
has not effects in his hands to answer the bill;
or to draw without order, or to draw and not
give advice of it; because it looks like a for∣wardness
to take the remitter's money without
giving him a sufficient demand for it, where he
expects and ought to have it.</P>
<P>A tradesman comes to me in <HI>London,</HI> and
desires me to give him a bill payable at <HI>Bristol,</HI>
for he is going to the Fair there, and being to
buy goods there, he wants money at <HI>Bristol</HI> to
pay for them; if I give him a bill, he pays
me down the money upon receipt of it, de∣pending
upon my credit for the acceptance of
the bill. If I draw this bill where I have no
reason to draw it, where I have no demand, or
no effects to answer it, or if I give my corre∣spondent
no advice of it, I abuse the remitter,
that is, the man whose money I take, and this
reflects upon my credit that am the drawer,
and the next time this tradesman wants money
at <HI>Bristol</HI> fair, he will not come to me; no,
says he, his last bills were not accepted: Or if
he does come to me, then he demands that he
should not pay his money till he has advice
that my bills are accepted.</P>
<P>BUT on the other hand, if bills are right
drawn, and advice duly given, and the person
has effects in his hands, then if he refuses the
bill, he says to the notary he does not accept
the bill, but gives no reason for it, only that
he says absolutely, I will not accept it, you
may take that for an answer; or he adds, I re∣fuse
to accept it for reasons best known to my
self; this is sometimes done, but this does not
<PB N="428" REF="449"/>
leave the person's credit who refuses, so clear as
the other, tho' perhaps it may not so directly
reflect upon him; but it leaves the case a little
dubious and uncertain, and men will be apt to
write back to the person who sent the bill to
enquire what the drawer says to it, and what
account he gives, or what character he has up∣on
his tongue for the person drawn upon.</P>
<P>As the punctual paying bills when accepted,
is a main article in the credit of the Acceptor,
so a tradesman should be very cautious in per∣mitting
men to draw upon him where he has
not effects, or does not give order; for tho', as
I said, it ought not to affect his reputation not
to accept a bill where it ought not to be drawn,
yet a tradesman that is nice of his own cha∣racter
does not love to be always or often re∣fusing
to accept bills, or to have bills drawn up∣on
him where he has no reason no accept them,
and therefore he will be very positive in for∣bidding
such drawing; and if notwithstanding
that, the importunities of the country trades∣man
obliges him to draw, the person drawn
upon will give smart and rough answers to such
bills; as particularly, I refuse to accept this bill
because I have no effects of the drawers to an∣swer
it: Or thus, I refuse to accept this bill,
because I not only gave no orders to draw, but
gave positive orders not to draw: Or thus, I
will accept this bill, nor any other this
man shall draw, and the like. This thoroughly
clears the credit of the acceptor, and reflects
grosly on the drawer.</P>
<P><PB N="429" REF="450"/>
AND yet, I say, even in this case, a trades∣man
does not care to be drawn upon, and be
oblig'd to see bills presented for acceptance,
and for payment, where he has given orders
not to draw, and where he has no effects to an∣swer.</P>
<P>IT is the great error of our country manu∣facturers,
in many, if not in most parts of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
at this time; that as soon as they can fi∣nish
their goods they hurry them up to <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
to their Factor, and as soon as the goods
are gone, immediately follow them with their
bills for the money, without waiting to hear
whether the goods are come to a market, are
sold, or in demand, and whether they are like∣ly
to sell quickly or not; thus they load the
factor's warehouse with their goods before they
are wanted, and load the factor with their bills
before it is possible that he can have gotten
cash in his hand to pay them.</P>
<P>THIS is, first, a direct borrowing money of
their factor; and it is borrowing, as it were,
whether the factor will lend or no, and some∣times
whether he can or no. The factor, if he
be a man of money, and answers their bills,
fails not to make them pay for advancing; or
sells the goods to loss to answer the bills;
which is making them pay dear for the loan;
or refuses their bills, and so baulks both their
business and their credit.</P>
<P>BUT if the factor, willing to oblige his em∣ployers,
and knowing he shall otherwise lose
their commission, accepts the bills on the cre∣dit
of the goods, and then not being able to
<PB N="430" REF="451"/>
sell the goods in time, is also made unable to
pay the bills when due; this reflects upon his
credit, tho' the fault is indeed in the drawer
whose effects are not come in; and this has
ruin'd many an honest factor.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> IT has hurt him by drawing large sums
out of his cash, for the supply of the needy
manufacturer, who is his employer, and has
thereby made him unable to pay his other bills
currently, even of such mens drafts who had
perhaps good reason to draw.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> IT keeps the factor always bare of
money, and wounds his reputation, so that he
pays those very bills with discredit, which in
justice to himself he ought not to pay at all,
and the borrower has the money at the expence
of the credit of the lender; whereas indeed the
reproach ought to be to him that borrows, not
to him that lends; to him that draws where
there are no effects to warrant his draft, not
to him that pays where he does not owe.</P>
<P>BUT the damage lies on the circumstance of
accepting the bill, for the factor lends his em∣ployer
the money the hour he accepts the bill,
and the blow to his credit is for not paying
when accepted; when the bill is accepted, the
acceptor is debtor to the person to whom the
bill is payable, or in his right to every endorser;
for a Bill of Exchange is in this case differing
from a bond, <HI>viz.</HI> that the right of action is
transferrable by endorsement, and every en∣dorser
has a right to sue the acceptor in his own
name, and can transfer that right to another;
whereas in a bond, tho' it be given to me by
<PB N="431" REF="452"/>
assignment, I must sue in the name of the first
person to whom the bond is payable, and he
may at any time discharge the bond, notwith∣standing
my assignment.</P>
<P>TRADESMEN then, <HI>especially such as are fac∣tors,</HI>
are unaccountably to blame to accept bills
for their employers before their goods are sold,
and the money receiv'd, or within reach: If
the employers cannot wait, the reproach should
lie <HI>on them,</HI> not on <HI>the factor;</HI> and indeed the
manufacturers all over <HI>England</HI> are greatly
wrong in that part of their business; for, not
considering the difference between a time of
demand and a time of glut, a quick or a dead
market, they go on in the same course of mak∣ing,
and without slackning their hands as to
quantity, crowd up their goods, as if it was e∣nough
to them that the factor had them, and
that they were to be reckoned as sold when
they were in his hands; but would the factor
truly represent to them the state of the mar∣ket;
that there are great quantities of goods in
hand unsold, and no present demand, desiring
them, to slack their hands a little in making;
and at the same time back their directions in a
plain and positive way, tho' with respect too,
by telling them they could accept no more
bills till the goods were sold: This would
bring the trade into a better regulation, and the
makers would stop their hands when the mar∣ket
stop'd; and when the merchant ceas'd to
buy, the manufacturers would cease to make,
and consequently would not crowd or clog the
marker with goods, or wrong their factors with
bills.</P>
<P><PB N="432" REF="453"/>
BUT this would require a large discourse,
and the manufacturers objections should be an∣swered,
<HI>viz.</HI> That they cannot stop, that they
have their particular sets of workmen and spin∣ners,
whom they are obliged to keep employed,
or if they should dismiss them they could not
have them again when a demand for goods
came, and the markets reviv'd, and that besides
the poor would starve.</P>
<P>THESE objections are easy to be answered,
tho' that is not my present business; but thus
far it is to my purpose, it is the factor's business
to keep himself within compass; if the goods
cannot be sold, the maker must stay till they
can; if the poor must be employ'd, the manu∣facturer
is right to keep them at work if he can;
but if he cannot without oppressing the factor,
then he makes the factor employ them, not
himself; and I do not see the factor has any ob∣ligation
upon him to consider the spinners and
weavers, especially not at the expence of his
own credit, and his family's safety.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, all tradesmen that trade
thus, whether by commission from the country,
or upon their own accounts, should make it
the standing order of their business not to suffer
themselves to be over-drawn by their employ∣ers,
so as to straiten themselves in their cash, and
make them unable to pay their bills when ac∣cepted.</P>
<P>IT is also to be observed, that when a trades∣man
once comes to suffer himself to be thus
over-drawn, and sinks his credit in kindness to
his employer, he buys his employment so dear
<PB N="433" REF="454"/>
as all his employer can do for him can never
repay the price.</P>
<P>AND even while he is thus serving his em∣ployer
he more and more wounds himself; for
suppose he does (with difficulty) raise money,
and after some dunning does pay the bills, yet
he loses in the very doing it, for he never pays
them with credit, but suffers in reputation by
every day's delay. In a word, a tradesman
that buys upon credit, that is to say, in a course
of credit, such as I have describ'd before, may
let the merchant or the warehousekeeper call
two or three times, and may put him off with∣out
much damage to his credit; and if he
makes them stay one time, he makes it up a∣gain
another, and recovers in one good pay∣ment,
what he lost in two or three bad ones.</P>
<P>BUT in Bills of Exchange, or Promissory
Notes, 'tis quite another thing; and he that va∣lues
his reputation in trade should never let a
bill come twice for payment, or a note under
his hand stay a day after it is due, that is to say,
after the three days of <HI>grace,</HI> as it is call'd;
Those three days indeed are granted to all bills
of exchange, not by law, but by the custom of
trade; 'tis hard to tell how this custom prevail'd,
or when it began, but it is one of those many
instances which may be given, where custom
of trade is equal to an establish'd law; and it
is so much a law now in it self, that no bill is
protested now till those three days are expir'd;
nor is a bill of exchange esteem'd due till the
third day; no man offers to demand it, nor
will any Goldsmith, or even the <HI>Bank</HI> it self,
<PB N="434" REF="455"/>
pay a foreign bill sooner. But that by the
way.</P>
<P>BILLS of Exchange being thus sacred in trade,
and inland bills being, (by the late law for pro∣testing
them, and giving interests and damage
upon them) made as near as can be, equally sa∣cred,
nothing can be of more moment to a
tradesman, than to pay them always punctually
and honourably.</P>
<P>LET no Critic cavil at the word <HI>honourably,</HI>
as it relates to Trade; punctual payment is the
honour of trade, and there is a word always
used among merchants which justifies my using
it in this
place; and that is, when a merchant
draws a bill from abroad upon his friend at
<HI>London,</HI> his correspondent in <HI>London</HI> answering
his letter, and approving his drawing upon him,
adds, that he shall be sure to <HI>honour</HI> his bill
when it appears; that is to say, to accept it.</P>
<P>LIKEWISE when the drawer gives advice of
his having drawn such a bill upon him, he
gives an account of the sum drawn, the name
of the person it is payable to, the time it is
drawn at, <HI>that is,</HI> the time given for payment,
and he adds thus, I doubt not your giving my
bill due honour; that is, of accepting it, and
paying it when it is due.</P>
<P>THIS term is also used in another case in fo∣reign
trade only, <HI>viz.</HI> A merchant abroad (say
it be at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> or at <HI>Bourdeaux</HI>) draws a bill
of 300 <HI>l.</HI> sterling upon his correspondent at
<HI>London:</HI> The correspondent happens to be dead,
or is broke, or by some other accident the bill
is not accepted; another merchant on the <HI>Ex∣change</HI>
<PB N="435" REF="456"/>
hearing of it, and knowing, and perhaps
corresponding with the merchant abroad who
drew the bill, and loth his credit should suffer
by the bill going back protested, accepts it,
and pays it for him. This is call'd accepting it
for the honour of the drawer; and he writes so
upon the bill when he accepts it, which entitles
him to re-draw the same sum with interest up∣on
the drawer in <HI>Lisbon,</HI> or <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> as a∣bove.</P>
<P>THIS is indeed a case peculiar to foreign com∣merce,
and is not often practised in home-trade,
and among shop-keepers, tho' sometimes I have
known it practised here too: but I name it on
two accounts; first, to legitimate the word <HI>ho∣nourable,</HI>
which I had used, and which has its
due propriety in matters of trade, tho' not in the
same acceptation as it generally receives in com∣mon
affairs; and secondly, to let the Tradesman
see how deeply the Honour, that is, the credit
of trade is concerned in the punctual payment
of Bills of Exchange; and the like of Promis∣sory
Notes, for in point of credit there is no
difference, tho' in matter of form there is.</P>
<P>AND now I have mentioned the form of a
Bill, and the difference there is between a Bill
of Exchange and a Promissory Note, I think
the tradesman will not take it ill that I give a
little direction about the form of both: a Trades∣man
in <HI>London</HI> may perhaps think himself ill
used, in being dictated to in such a case, and
think it is to suppose he cannot read, and that he
should be sent to school again to learn his horn-book;
but all instruction is to the ignorant;
<PB N="436" REF="457"/>
they that know it may pass it over, it is not
written for them; and they that are ignorant
will not be angry if they find here what may
inform them, without putting them to the mor∣tification
of exposing their ignorance by doing
a thing wrong, which they may so easily see
how to do right.</P>
<P>THERE are a great many variations in the
drawing bills from foreign countries, according
as the customs and usages of merchants direct,
and according as the coins and rates of ex∣change
differ, and according as the same terms
are differently understood in several places; as
the word <HI>Usance</HI> and <HI>two Usance,</HI> which is a
term for the number of days given for pay∣ment,
after the date of the Bill; and tho' this
is a thing particularly relating to merchants,
and to foreign commerce, yet as the nature of
Bills of Exchange is pretty general, and that
sometimes an inland tradesman, especially in
sea-port towns, may be obliged to take foreign
accepted Bills in payment for their goods; or if
they have money to spare (as sometimes it is
an inland tradesman's good luck to have) may
be asked to discount such Bills; I say, on this
account, and that they may know the value of
a foreign Bill when they see it, and how far it
has to run, before it is to be demanded, I think
it not foreign to the case before me, to give
them the following account.</P>
<P>1. As to the times of payment in foreign
Bills of Exchange, and the terms of art ordi∣narily
used by merchants in drawing, <HI>and ex∣press'd
in</HI> the said bills; the times of payment
<PB N="437" REF="458"/>
are, as above, either (1.) At sight; which is to
be understood, not the day it is presented, but
three days (call'd days of grace) after the bill is
accepted: (2.) Usance: (3.) Two Usance. There
are also usages of towns and places during great
fairs held in those places; as a bill drawn on a
merchant at <HI>Madrid</HI> during the great fair there,
and accepted in the fair, is payable at four
months; at <HI>Lyons</HI> the like is three months, and
at <HI>Frankfort au main</HI> is six months. But to
speak of the words Usance, and Two Usance
only, which are the terms generally us'd now,
in drawing Bills in foreign trade, they are un∣derstood
as fotlows:</P>
<Q><P>USANCE between <HI>London</HI> and all the towns
in the States General's Dominions, and al∣so
in the provinces now call'd the <HI>Au∣strian
Netherlands,</HI> is one month: And
Two Usance is two months; reckoning
not from the acceptance of the bill, but
from the date of it.</P>
<P>USANCE between <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> is
two months, <HI>Venice</HI> is three months; and
Double Usance, or Two Usance, is double
that time.</P>
<P>USANCE payable at <HI>Florence</HI> or <HI>Leghorn,</HI> is
two months; but from thence payable at
<HI>London,</HI> Usance is three months.</P>
<P>USANCE from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Roan</HI> or <HI>Paris,</HI> is
one month; but they generally draw at a
certain number of days, usually twenty
one days sight.</P>
<P><PB N="438" REF="459"/>
USANCE from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Seville,</HI> is two
months; as likewise between <HI>London</HI> and
<HI>Lisbon,</HI> and <HI>Oporto,</HI> to or from.</P>
<P>USANCE from <HI>Genoa</HI> to <HI>Rome</HI> is payable at
<HI>Rome</HI> ten days after sight.</P>
<P>USANCE between <HI>Antwerp</HI> and <HI>Genoa, Na∣ples</HI>
or <HI>Messina,</HI> is two months, whether to
or from.</P>
<P>USANCE from <HI>Antwerp</HI> or <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> pay∣able
at <HI>Venice,</HI> is two months, payable in
Bank.</P></Q>
<P>THERE are abundance of niceties in the ac∣cepting
and paying of Bills of Exchange, espe∣cially
foreign Bills, which I think needless to
enter upon here; but this I think I should not
omit, namely,</P>
<P>THAT if a man pays a Bill of Exchange be∣fore
it is due, tho' he had accepted it, If the
man to whom it was payable proves a bank∣rupt
after he has received the money, and yet
before the Bill becomes due, the person who
voluntarily paid the money before it was due,
shall be liable to pay it again to the remitter;
for as the remitter deliver'd his money to the
drawer, in order to have it paid again to such
person as he should order, it is, and ought to
be in his power to divert the payment by alter∣ing
the Bill, and make it payable to any other
person whom he thinks fit, during all the time
between the acceptance and the day of pay∣ment.</P>
<P><PB N="439" REF="460"/>
THIS has been controverted, I know, in some
cases, but I have always found that by the most
experienced merchants, and especially in places
of the greatest business abroad, it was always
given in favour of the remitter; <HI>viz.</HI> that the right
of guiding the payment is in him, all the time
the bill is running; and no bill can or ought
to be paid before it is due, without the declared
assent of the remitter, signify'd under his hand,
and attested by a publick notary.</P>
<P>THERE are, I say, abundance of niceties in
the matter of foreign exchanges, and in the
manner of drawing, accepting and protesting
Bills; as also in the calculating the value of
the coins they are payable in, and payable for,
reducing them into a proportioned value to one
another, which if I should enter into an en∣quiry
about here, it would be needful to de∣scribe
all the several coins, as well real as ima∣ginary,
that are usually mentioned in ex∣changes,
which would be too long for this
works; and as I am now speaking with, and
have confin'd my discourse in this work to the
Inland tradesmen of <HI>England,</HI> I think it would
be as unprofitable to them to meddle with this,
as it would be difficult to them to understand it.</P>
<P>I return therefore to the subject in hand, as
well as to the people to whom I have all along
directed my discourse.</P>
<P>THO' the Inland tradesmen do not, and need
not acquaint themselves with the manner of
foreign Exchanges, yet there is a great deal of
business done by exchange among our selves,
<PB N="440" REF="461"/>
and at home, and in which our inland trade
is chiefly concern'd; and as this is the reason
why I speak so much, and repeat it so often
to the tradesman for whose instruction I am
writing, that he should maintain the credit of
his bills, so it may not be amiss to give the
tradesman some directions concerning such Bills.</P>
<P>1. A very great part of the bills drawn out
of the several counties in <HI>England</HI> upon the
tradesmen in <HI>London,</HI> such as factors and ware∣house-keepers,
are made payable to the General
Receivers of the several taxes and duties, Cus∣toms
and excises which are levied in the coun∣try
in specie, and the money is remitted by those
collectors
and receivers on account of those
duties; This generally appears by the bills or
the endorsements, which often mention it in
these words, <HI>for his Majesty's use;</HI> In this case
a default of payment of any of these bills, af∣ter
being accepted, exposes the tradesman to the
terror as well as the terrible operation of an
Extent; which would, <HI>at least might</HI> be to his
utter ruin and undoing; not only his credit is
blasted, but his whole Fortune and figure is de∣molished
at once, for an Extent tears all to
pieces.</P>
<P>2. HE is to consider, that in other bills where
there is not the immediate hazard of an Ex∣tent,
yet the bills themselves pass frequently
from one hand to another by endorsement, and
if the bill comes to be protested afterwards
<PB N="441" REF="462"/>
and returned, it goes back again thro' all those
hands with this mark of the Tradesman's dis∣grace
upon it, namely, that it has been accept∣ed,
but that the man who accepted it is not
able to pay it, than which nothing can expose
the Tradesman more.</P>
<P>3. HE is to consider that the grand charac∣teristick
of a Tradesman, and by which his cre∣dit
is rated, is this of paying his Bills <HI>well</HI> or
<HI>ill.</HI> If any man goes to the neighbours or deal∣ers
of a tradesman to enquire of his credit, or
his fame in business, which is often done upon
almost every extraordinary occasion, the first
question is, How does he pay his Bills? As
when we go to a master or mistress to enquire
the character of a maid-servant, one of the first
questions generally is of her probity, <HI>Is she ho∣nest?</HI>
so here, if you would be able to judge of
the man, your first question is, What for a
paymaster is he? How does he pay his bills?
Strongly intimating, and indeed very reason∣ably,
that if he has any credit, or any regard
to his credit, he will be sure to pay his bills
well; and if he does not pay his bills well, he
cannot be sound at bottom, because he would
never suffer a slur there, if it were possible for
him to avoid it. On the other hand, if a
tradesman pays his bills punctually, let what∣ever
other slur be upon his reputation, his cre∣dit
will hold good. I knew a man in the
city who upon all occasions of business issued
promissory notes, or notes under his hand, at
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="440" REF="463"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="441" REF="464"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="442" REF="465"/>
such or such time, and it was for an immense
sum of money that he gave out such notes;
so that they became frequent in trade, and at
length people began to carry them about to
discount, which lessened the Gentleman so
much, (tho' he was really a man of substance)
that his bills went at last at 20 <HI>per cent.</HI> dis∣count,
or more; and yet this man maintain'd
his credit by this, that tho' he would always
take as much time as he could get in these
notes, yet when they came due they were al∣ways
punctually paid to a day; no man came
twice for his money.</P>
<P>THIS was a trying case, for tho' upon the
multitude of his notes that were out, and by
reason of the large discount given upon them,
his credit at first suffered exceedingly, and men
began to talk very dubiously of him; yet up∣on
the punctual discharge of them when due,
it began presently to be taken notice of, and
said openly how well he paid his notes; upon
which presently the rate of his discount fell,
and in a short time all his notes were at <HI>par;</HI> so
that punctual payment, in spite of rumour (and
of a rumour not so ill grounded as rumours
generally are) prevail'd, and establish'd the cre∣dit
of the person who was indeed rich at bot∣tom,
but might have found it hard enough to
have stood it, if as his bills had a high dis∣count
upon them they had been ill paid too.
All which confirms what I have hitherto al∣ledged,
namely, of how much concern it is for
a tradesman to pay his Bills, and Promissory Notes
very punctually.</P>
<P><PB N="443" REF="466"/>
I might argue here how much it is his in∣terest
to do so, and how it enables him to coin
as many bills as he pleases; <HI>in short,</HI> a man
whose notes are currently paid, and the credit
of whose Bills is establish'd by their being
punctually paid, has an infinite advantage in
Trade; he is a Bank to himself, he can buy
what bargains he pleases, no advantage in busi∣ness
offers but he can grasp at it, for his Notes
are current as another man's cash, if he buys
at Time in the country, he has nothing to do
but to order them to draw for the money
when it is due, and he gains all the time given
in the bills into the bargain.</P>
<P>IF he knows what he buys, and how to put
it off, he buys a thousand pounds worth of
goods at once, sells them for less time than
he buys at, and pays them with their own
money. I might swell this discourse to a vo∣lume
by it self, to set out the particular profit
that such a man may make of his Credit, and
how he can raise what sums he will, by buying
goods, and by ordering the people who he is to
pay in the country, to draw bills on him: Nor
is it any loss to those he buys of, for as all the
Remitters of money know his Bills, and they
are currently paid, they never scruple deliver∣ing
their money upon his Bills, so that the
countryman or manufacturer is effectually sup∣plied,
and the Time given in the bill is the
property of the current dealer on whom they
are drawn.</P>
<P><PB N="444" REF="467"/>
BUT then let me add a caution here for
the best of tradesmen not to neglect, <HI>viz.</HI>
As the Tradesman should take care to pay his
bills and notes currently, so, that he may do
it, he must be careful what notes he issues out,
and how he suffers others to draw on him.
He that is careful of his reputation in business,
will also be cautious not to let any man he
deals with over-draw him, or Draw upon him
before the Money Drawn for is due: And as
to Notes promissory, or under his hand, he is
careful not to give out such Notes but on
good occasions, and where he has the effects
in his hand to answer them; this keeps his
cash whole, and preserves his ability of per∣forming
and punctually paying when the Notes
become Due; and the want of this caution has
ruin'd the reputation of a Tradesman many
times, when he might otherwise have preserv'd
himself in as good credit and condition as o∣ther
men.</P>
<P>ALL these cautions are made thus needful
on account of that one useful maxim, that the
Tradesman's ALL depends upon his punctual
complying with the payment of his Bills. I
conclude this work with observing that many
Tradesmen, in the country especially, being
ignorant of the form of drawing bills, it may
be useful to give them some such forms as will
always pass with the best and most experienc'd
