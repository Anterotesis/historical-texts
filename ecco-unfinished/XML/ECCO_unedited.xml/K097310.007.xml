<P>IN the article Buffalo, we remarked, that the
modern Latins had improperly applied to it
the name <HI>bubalus.</HI> This appellation antiently
belonged to the animal we are now treating of,
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
whose nature is very different from that of
the buffalo. In some external qualities it re∣sembles
the stag, the gazelles, and the ox. It
resembles the stag in size and figure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the figure and description of the Barbary cow in the <HI>Mem. pour servir à l'hist. des animaux, part. 2. p. 24. tab.</HI> 39.</NOTE>, and par∣ticularly
in the form of its limbs: But its
horns are permanent, and nearly constructed
like those of the largest gazelles, to which it is
allied by this character as well as its natural dis∣positions.
Its head, however, is much longer
than that of the gazelles, or even that of the
stag. In fine, it resembles the ox in the length
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
of the muzzle, and in the disposition of the
bones of the head, which, as in the ox, jut
not out behind farther than the frontal bone.
These relations in external structure, joined to
its antient name being forgotten, are the rea∣sons
why, in modern times, it has obtained the
compound denominations of <HI>buselaphus, bull∣stag,</HI>
bucula-cervina, <HI>cow-hind, Barbary cow,</HI>
&amp;c. Even the name <HI>bubalus</HI> comes from bu∣bulus,
and has been applied to it on account of
the similarity of this animal to the ox.</P>
<P>The head of the bubalus is narrow; the eyes
are placed very high; and the front is short and
narrow. The horns are large, black, permanent,
and furnished with large rings. They spring
near each other, but recede considerably at their
extremities. They bend backward, and are twist∣ed
spirally<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Mem. pour servir à l'hist. des animaux, part. 2. p. 24. tab. 39.</NOTE>. His shoulders are so high, that
they form a kind of bunch on the withers.
The tail is nearly a foot long, and garnished
with a tuft of hairs at the point. The ears are
similar to those of the <HI>antilope.</HI> Kolbe<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The African elk.—Its head is beautiful, and resembles that of the stag, but it is smaller in proportion to the size of the body. Its horns are about a foot in length. Near the head they are rugged, but straight, uniform, and pointed at the extremities. Its neck is free and beautiful. The up∣per lip is a little larger than the under. Its limbs are long, thin, and delicate; and its tail is about a foot in length. The hair which covers its body is soft, smooth, and of an ash-co∣lour.—The African elk weighs about four hundred pounds; <HI>Descript. du Cap de Bonne-esperance, par Kolbe, tom. 3. chap.</HI> 4.</NOTE> has
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
given to this animal the appellation of <HI>elk,</HI> though
it has no other resemblance to the elk than in
its hair being more slender at the root than in
the middle, or at the point, which is peculiar to
those two animals; for, in almost every qua∣druped,
the hair is always grosser at the root
than in the middle, or at the point. The hair
of the bubalus is nearly of the same colour with
that of the elk, though it is much shorter, softer,
and less bushy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The habit of body, the legs, and the neck of this animal, give it a stronger resemblance to a stag than to a cow, of which last he has only the horns, and even these differ con∣siderably from those of the cow. They spring very near each other; because the head is here extremely narrow; but, in the cow, the front is very large. They are about a foot long, black, bended backward, twisted spirally, and so used before and above, that the elevations of the screw were almost en∣tirely effaced. The tail exceeded not thirteen inches in length, including the tuft of hair at the point, which was three inches long. The ears resembled those of the gazelles, the inside being garnished, in some places, with white hair; the rest was naked, and exhibited a skin perfectly black and smooth. The eyes were high and so near the horns, that the head seemed to have no front. There were only two very thin, short teats, which render this animal very different from our cows. The shoulders were so high, that they formed a kind of bunch on the withers.—This animal seems rather to be the bubalus of the antients than the small African ox described by Belon; for Solinus compares the bubalus to the stag; Oppian gives him horns turned backward; and Pliny says, that he par∣takes of the calf and stag; <HI>Mem. pour servir à l'hist. des a∣nimaux, part. 2. p.</HI> 25.</NOTE>. These are the only resemblances
between the elk and bubalus; for they differ in
every other particular. The horns of the elk
are larger and heavier than those of the stag, and
are likewise renewed annually. The horns of
the bubalus, on the contrary, never fall off, but
continue to grow during life, and resemble, in
figure and texture, those of the gazelles. He
resembles the gazelles still more in the figure of
his body, the lightness of his head, the length
of his neck, the position of his eyes, ears, and
horns, and in the form and length of his tail.
The gentlemen of the Academy of Sciences, to
whom this animal was presented under the name
of the <HI>Barbary cow,</HI> and who adopted that deno∣mination,
have not failed to recognise it to be the
<HI>bubalus</HI> of the antients. Though we have re∣jected
this compound appellation, we hesitate not
to copy here their exact description, by which it
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
appears that this animal is not a gazelle, a
goat, a cow, an elk, or a stag<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bubalus is separated from the stag-kind by two es∣sential characters: 1. The horns never shed; 2. The bubalus has a gall-bladder, which is wanting in the stag, the fallow-deer, the roebuck, &amp;c. “The gall-bladder,” say the gentlemen of the academy, “was placed on the right side; its internal half was attached to the liver, and the membrane which formed the external half was thin, delicate, and folded, being entirely void of gall;” <HI>Mem. pour servir à l'hist. des ani∣maux, part. 2. p.</HI> 29.</NOTE>, but that it is a
particular and distinct species. Besides, it is the
same with that described by Caius<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ex Mauritaniae desertis locis (inquit <HI>Joh. Caius Anglus,</HI>) ad nos adventum est animal bisulco vestigio, magnitudine cervae, forma et aspectu inter cervam et juvencam; unde ex argumento voco <HI>Buselaphum</HI> seu <HI>Bovi-cervum, Moschelaphum</HI> seu <HI>Buculam-cervinam:</HI> Capite et aure longa atque tenui, tibia et ungula gracili ut cervae, ita ut ad celeritatem videatur fac∣tum animal.

Gesner, Hist. quad. p.</HI> 121.</NOTE> under the
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
name of <HI>buselaphus;</HI> and I was surprised that
the gentlemen of the Academy omitted this re∣mark,
as all the characters ascribed by Caius
to his <HI>buselaphus</HI> correspond with their Barbary
cow.</P>
<P>In the Royal Cabinet there is, 1. A skeleton
of the bubalus, which had been described and
dissected by the gentlemen of the Academy;
2. A head, which is much larger than that of
the skeleton, and the horns are also thicker
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
and longer; 3. A portion of another head, with
horns as large as the former, but whose figure
and direction are different. Hence in the bu∣bali,
as well as in the gazelles, antilopes, &amp;c.
there are varieties in the size of the body and
the figure of the horns. But these differences
seem to be too inconsiderable to constitute di∣stinct
species.</P>
<P>The bubalus is very common in Barbary, and
in all the northern parts of Africa. He has
nearly the same dispositions with the antilopes;
and, like them, his hair is short, his skin black,
and his flesh is good eating.</P>

<HEAD>The CONDOMA, or STRIPED AN∣TILOPE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The striped antilope has smooth horns twisted spirally, compressed sidewise, with a ridge on one side following the wreaths; they consist of three bends, are three feet nine inches long, and of a pale brown colour; they are close at the base, and two feet seven inches and a half distant at the points, which are round and sharp. In the upper jaw, there is a hard horny substance disposed in ridges. The length of the animal is nine feet, and the height four. The body is long and slender; the legs are slender, the face is brown and mark∣ed with two white lines proceeding from the corner of each eye, and uniting above the nose. The colour in general is of a reddish cast mixed with gray. From the tail, along the top of the back, to the shoulders, there is a white stripe; from this are seven others, four pointing towards the thighs, and three towards the belly. On the upper part of the neck is a short mane. Beneath the neck, from the throat to the breast, are some long hairs hanging down. The breast and belly are gray. The tail is two feet long, brown above, white beneath, and black at the end; <HI>Pennant's Synops. of quad. p.</HI> 31.</P>

<P>THE Marquis de Marigny, who never loses
an opportunity of encouraging arts and
sciences, showed me in his cabinet the head of
an animal, which, at first sight, I took to be
that of a large bubalus. It resembles the head
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
of our largest stags. But, instead of solid
horns, like those of the stag, it had two large,
hollow horns, with a ridge like those of the he-goat,
and a double flexion, like those of the an∣tilopes.
In searching the royal cabinet, I found
two horns which belonged to this animal. The
first had been brought from the King's wardrobe,
without any title or name. The second I had
from M. Baurhis, commissary of the navy, un∣der
the name of the <HI>Condoma</HI> of the Cape of
Good Hope; which name we have adopted,
because the animal has not hitherto been descri∣bed
or denominated.</P>
<P>From the length, thickness, and especially the
double flexion of the horns, the condoma makes
a near approach to the <HI>Strepsiceros</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strepsicerotis cornua tam graphice descripsit Plinius, at∣que lyris tam apposite comparavit, ut longiore verborum ambitu opus non sit. Ergo hoc tantum addam: Ea esse intus cava, sed longa pedes Romanos duos palmos tres, si rec∣to ductu metiaris: Si flexo, pro natura cornuum, pedes tres integros. Crassa sunt, ubi capiti committuntur, digitos Roma∣nos tres cum semisse. Describuntur in ambitu palmis Romanis duobus et dimidio, eo ipso in loco. In summo, levore quo∣dam nigrescunt, cum in imo fusca magis et rugosa sint. Jam inde a primo ortu sensim gracilescunt, et tandem in acutum exeunt. Pendent, una cum facie sicca per longitudinem di∣midiata, libras septem uncias tres et semissem. Facies, quae adhuc superest juncta cornibus, et frontis cervicisque pilus, loquuntur <HI>Strepsicerotem</HI> animal esse magnitudine fere cervina, et pilo rufo ad instar cervini. Sed an nare et figura corporis cervina sit, ex facie nihil habeo certi dicere, cum nares diu∣turni temporis usu detritae sint, et facies eadem de causa hinc inde glabra sit; conjiceres tamen ex eo quod superest eum propius accedere ad cervum aut platycerotem; <HI>Caius, apud Gesnerum, de quad. p.</HI> 295.</NOTE> of Caius.
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>
The figure, and even all the dimensions of the
horns, are almost perfectly the same. From this
correspondence in the size and figure of the head
and horns, we may presume that the condoma
and <HI>strepsiceros</HI> of Caius are the same animal, e∣specially
when the following reflections are at∣tended
to: 1. Caius, it is obvious, was decei∣ved,
when he made this animal the <HI>strepsiceros</HI> of
the antients; for the <HI>strepsiceros</HI> of the antients
is unquestionably the <HI>antilope,</HI> whose head is ve∣ry
different from that of the stag. Now Caius
tells us, that the head of his strepsiceros resem∣bled
that of the stag; and, therefore, it could
not be the strepsiceros of the antients. 2. Caius's
animal, like the condoma, had thick horns, a∣bove
three feet long, covered with rugosities, in∣stead
of rings or tubercles; but the horns of the
strepsiceros of the antients, or <HI>antilope,</HI> are much
thinner and shorter, having both rings and tu∣bercles.
3. Though the horns of the condoma in
the cabinet of the Marquis de Marigny, as well
as those which were brought from the King's
wardrobe, had been polished by friction, it is
easy to perceive that they never had rings. This
fact is farther demonstrated by the horn sent to
me by M. Baurhis, which had never been touch∣ed,
and yet it had only rugosities like the he∣goat,
and no rings like the <HI>antilope.</HI> Now, Caius
himself tells us, that the horns of his strepsiceros
had rugosities only. Hence this strepsiceros is
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
not that of the antients, but the animal we are
here treating of, which possesses all the charac∣ters
which Caius attributes to his.</P>
<P>In examining the writings of travellers, we
have found nothing that approaches so near to
the genuine idea of this animal, which is so
remarkable for its size, and particularly the
largeness of its horns, as the quadruped men∣tioned
by Kolbe under the denomination of
the <HI>wild-goat</HI> of the Cape of Good Hope.
“This goat,” says he, “which has received no
name from the Hottentots, and which I
have called the <HI>wild-goat,</HI> is remarkable
in many respects. It is of the size of a
large stag; its head is very beautiful, and a∣dorned
with two smooth horns, which are
bended and pointed. They are three feet in
length, and their extremities are two feet a∣sunder.”
These characters seem to correspond
exactly with the animal under consideration: But,
having seen the head only, we cannot be equal∣ly
certain that the rest of Kolbe's description<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From the front, and along the whole back as far as the tail, there is a white stripe; another, of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame colour surrounds the lower part of the neck; other two of the same kind surround the body, the one behind the fore-legs, and the other before the hind-legs. The hair on the rest of the body is gray, with some reddish spots, except that on the belly, which is white. The beard is gray and very long. The limbs, though long, are well proportioned; <HI>Descript. du Cap de Bonne-esperance, par Kolbe, tom. 3. p.</HI> 42.</NOTE>
will apply to it with equal precision. Future
observations alone can determine the truth of
what now appears to be extremely probable.</P>

<P>THIS animal, though not taken notice of
by any naturalist or traveller, is very com∣mon
in Senegal, from which M. Adanson brought
a skin of it, and presented it to the royal cabinet.
It resembles the gazelles, and particularly the
nanguer, in the size and figure of the body, in
the lightness of the limbs, in the form of the
head and muzzle, in the eyes and ears, and in
the length of the tail and the want of a beard.
But all the gazelles, and especially the nanguers,
have their bellies of a fine white colour; while
the breast and belly of the guib are of a deep
chesnut. It differs likewise from the gazelles by
its horns, which are smooth, without transverse
rings, and have two longitudinal ribs, the one
above and the other below, forming a spiral
twist from the base to the point: They are also

the guib approach the goat more than the gazelle.
It is, however, neither the one nor the other, but
an intermediate species. This animal is remark∣able
for white bands upon a chesnut ground co∣lour.
These bands are disposed along and cross
the body, like a harness. He lives in society,
and great flocks of them are found in the plains

<P>THIS animal is known to the naturalists
by the appellation of the <HI>Grimm goat</HI> only,
which, as we are ignorant of the name given it
in its native country, we shall adopt. There is
a figure of it in the German<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ephem. Nat. Cur. an. 14. obs. 57.</NOTE> Ephemerides,
which has been copied in the Academy Collec∣tion<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Collect. Academ. tom. 3 pl. 26.</NOTE>.
Dr Herman Grimm was the first who
mentioned this animal; and what he says con∣cerning
it was copied by Mr Ray, and after∣wards
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>
by all the nomenclators. Though his de∣scription
be incomplete<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a castle, near the Cape of Good Hope, says Dr Her∣man-Nicolas Grimm, I saw a very singular species of wild goat. It was of an obscure ash-colour. On the top of its head there was a tuft of erect hairs; and, between each eye and nostrils, a cavity filled with a yellowish humour, which was oily and viscid, and, when exposed to the air, became black and hard: This substance, the odour of which partici∣pates both of castor and musk, renews successively after the cavities are emptied. I was assured that the cavities had no communication with the eyes, and that the thick humour they contained was different from that collected in the large angle of the eyes of stags and several other animals; <HI>Ephem. des curieux de la Nature, decad. 2. ann. 4. 1686. Obs. 57. Collection Academique, Dijon, tom. 3. p. 696. tab.</HI> 26.</NOTE>, he points out two cha∣racters
so remarkable, that we easily recognised a
head of a Senegal animal, sent us by M. Adan∣son,
to belong to the grimm. The first is an e∣normous
cavity below each eye, which pene∣trates
so deep as to leave only a thin plate of
bone between each cavity and the partition of
the nose: The second is a bushy tuft of hair re∣flected
backward on the top of the head. These
characters sufficiently distinguish the grimm from
all the other goats or gazelles. It has, however,
a resemblance to both, not only in the form of
the body, but even in the horns, which are an∣nulated
toward the base, furrowed longitudinally,
like those of the gazelles, and, at the same time,
directed horizontally backward, and very short,
like those of the small African goat, formerly
mentioned. Besides, this animal being much
<PB N="16" REF="23"/>
smaller than the goats, gazelles, &amp;c. and having
very short horns, seems to constitute the shade
between the goats and the <HI>chevrotains,</HI> or small
antilopes.</P>
<P>In the species of the grimm, the males alone
appear to have horns; for the individual descri∣bed
and engraved by Dr Grimm had no horns;
and the head given us by M. Adanson had two
short horns nearly concealed among the hair,
though still apparent enough to be seen by the
drawer: Besides, in the history of the <HI>chevrotains,</HI>
or small antilopes, we will find, that, in the
royal or Guinea antilope, the male alone has
horns; which makes it probable that the same is
the case with the grimm species, which is more
allied to the small antilopes than to any other
animal.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Mess. Vosmaër and Pallas have given descrip∣tions
of this beautiful animal, and a good figure
of it, which we have here copied. It is worthy
of remark, that the horns of the grimm, pre∣served
in the Royal Cabinet, bend a little for∣ward
at their points; while those described by
Vosmaër and Pallas bend a little backward. The
ears of the former are round at the extremities;
<PB N="17" REF="24"/>
but those of the latter terminate in a point. Is
this a natural variety, or an error in the draw∣ing?
Vosmaër and Pallas's grimm has the point
of the nose black, a black band extending from
the nose along the chanfrin, and ending at the
tuft of hair placed on the top of the front. The
head in the Royal Cabinet has not this band.
These slight differences, however, are not suffi∣cient
to constitute distinct species.</P>
<P>M. Vosmaër calls this animal the <HI>small beau∣tiful
buck</HI> of Guinea, probably on account of
its elegance. But I shall retain the name of
<HI>grimm;</HI> because, under that appellation, it is
known to all the naturalists.</P>
<P>“This animal,” M. Vosmaër remarks, “was a
male, and one of the most beautiful and delicate
creatures I ever saw. It was sent from Guinea
to Holland along with thirteen others of the
same species, and of both sexes. Twelve of
them died during the voyage, and in this num∣ber
were all the females; so that there remain∣ed
alive only two males, which were put
into the menagerie of the Prince of Orange,
where one of them died in the winter 1764.
According to our information, the females have
no horns. These animals are extremely timid.
Any noise, and particularly thunder, terrifies
them. When surprised, they express their
fear by blowing suddenly and with great force
through their nose.”</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="25"/>
“The one which is still alive (in 1766) was
at first wild; but has now become pretty tame.
It listens when called by its name <HI>Tetje,</HI> and,
when gently approached, with a piece of bread
in the hand, it allows its head and neck to be
stroaked. It is so cleanly, that it suffers not
the smallest particle of dirt to remain on any
part of its body; for this purpose, it often
scratches itself with one of its hind feet. This
is the reason why it has received the appella∣tion
of <HI>Tetje,</HI> from <HI>Tettig,</HI> which signifies
<HI>neat</HI> or <HI>clean.</HI> However, if a person continues
for some time to rub its body, a white powder
adheres to his fingers, like that which proceeds
from horses when they are curried.”</P>
<P>“This animal is extremely agile; and, when
reposing, it frequently keeps one of its fore-feet
in an elevated and bended position, which gives
it a very agreeable appearance. It is fed with
bread, rye, and carrots: It likewise spontane∣ously
eats potatoes. It is a ruminating animal,
and discharges its excrements in small balls,
the size of which is considerable in propor∣tion
to the magnitude of the creature.”</P>
<P>Dr Herman Grimm tells us, that the fat, vis∣cid,
yellow humour, which is secreted in the
cavities above the eyes of this animal, has an
odour that participates of musk and castoreum.
M. Vosmaër remarks, that, in his live subject,
this viscid matter had no odour of any kind;
and that the figure given by Grimm is extreme∣ly
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>
erroneous; for it represents a tuft of hair on the
fore-head, which has no existence; and his
subject, which was a female, had no horns;
“But ours,” continues M. Vosmaër, “is a male,
and has large horns in proportion to its size:
And, instead of this high, erect tuft of hair,
it had only a small quantity, which rose a
little to a point between the horns. It is a∣bout
the size of a kid of two months old;”
(though it was probably three or four years of
age; because it was sent from Guinea before
the winter 1764, and M. Vosmaër published
his description of it in the year 1767.) “Its
limbs are fine, and well suited to its body. Its
head is beautiful, and pretty much resembles
that of a roebuck. The eye is lively and full
of fire. The nose is black and naked, but al∣ways
moist. The nostrils are shaped like a
long crescent. The edges of the muzzle are
black. The upper lip, though not divided,
has the appearance of being separated into two
lobes. There is no hair on the chin; but, a
little higher, there are, on each side, a kind of
small whiskers; and, under the throat, a sort
of wart garnished with hair,” (which brings
this animal still nearer to the goat-kind, most of
whom have similar warts or excrescences on
their throats).</P>
<P>“The tongue is rather round than oblong or
pointed.... The horns are black, finely fur∣rowed
from top to bottom, and about three
<PB N="20" REF="27"/>
inches in length: They are perfectly straight,
and terminate in a very sharp point. At the
base, they are nearly three quarters of an inch
thick; and they are ornamented with three
rings, which rise a little backward.”</P>
<P>“The hairs on the front are straighter than the
others; and, at the origin of the horns, they are
coarse, gray, and crisped. Between the horns,
the hair is more erect, and forms a kind of
pointed black tuft, from which a stripe of the
same colour descends and loses itself in the
nose.”</P>
<P>“The ears are large, and have, on the outside,
three cavities or depressions, directed from the
top to the bottom. Internally, and at the sum∣mit,
the ears are garnished with white, short
hair: The rest of the ears are naked and black.
The eyes are pretty large, and of a deep brown
colour. The hair on the eye-lids is black,
close, and long, especially on the upper eye-lid.
Above the eyes there are some long hairs; but
they are thinly dispersed.”</P>
<P>“On both sides, between the eyes and nose,
we see those remarkable cavities by which this
animal is easily distinguished. These parts are
naked and black. In the middle, a cavity or
depression appears, which is somewhat callous,
and always moist. A small quantity of a vis∣cid,
gummy humour, distills from it, which
soon hardens, and becomes black. The ani∣mal
seems occasionally to throw off this ex∣crementitious
<PB REF="28"/>

<PB N="21" REF="29"/>
matter; for we find it hard and
black on the stakes of his lodge, as if it had
been wiped off. With regard to the odour,
mentioned by Dr Grimm and his followers,
I could never discover it.”</P>
<P>“The under part of the neck, which is mo∣derately
long, is covered with pretty coarse
hair, of a yellowish gray colour, like that of the
head. But the throat and upper part of the
neck is white.”</P>
<P>“The hair on the body is black and stiff,
though it be soft to the touch. That on the
anterior parts is of a fine bright gray colour;
farther back it is a bright brown; toward the
belly it is gray; and, lower down, it is per∣fectly
white.”</P>
<P>“The legs are extremely slender, and blackish
near the hoofs. The anterior parts of the fore∣feet,
as far as the knees, are adorned with a
black band. They have no heels; but, in
their place, there is a slight excrescence. The
feet are cloven, and provided with beautiful,
black, pointed, smooth hoofs.”</P>
<P>“The tail is very short, white, and marked
above with a black band. With regard to the
organs of generation, they are firmly inclosed
in a black scrotum, hang down between the
legs, and are provided with a large prepuce.”</P>

<P>THE name <HI>Chevrotain (Tragulus)</HI> has been
applied to those small animals of the
warm regions of Africa and Asia, which are
mentioned by almost every traveller under the
denomination of the <HI>small stag,</HI> or the <HI>small hind.</HI>
They, indeed, resemble the stag in the figure of
the muzzle, in lightness of body, in the form of
the limbs, and in the shortness of the tail. But
they differ from him prodigiously in size, the
largest not exceeding the magnitude of a hare.
Besides, some of them want horns entirely; and,
in those which have horns, they are hollow, an∣nulated,
and pretty similar to those of the ga∣zelles.
Their small cloven foot has also a great∣er
resemblance to the foot of the gazelle than to
that of the stag; and their want of pits, or de∣pressions
under the eyes, removes them equally
from the gazelles and the stags. In this article
they approach the goats: But, in fact, they are
neither stags, gazelles, nor goats, but constitute
one or several distinct species. Seba gives a de∣scription

fifth, which is larger than the three first, and
whose hair is much longer, and of a deeper
yellow colour, seems to be only a variety of the
<PB N="25" REF="33"/>
first kind. The fourth, which Seba mentions
as a native of Surinam, appears to be a second
variety of this species, which is found in Africa,
but not in the southern regions of Asia; and I
am inclined to think, that Seba has been ill in∣formed,
when he tells us, that this animal came
from Surinam. All voyagers mention these
small stags or chevrotains, as being found in Se∣negal,
Guiney, and the East-Indies; but no tra∣veller
affirms that he has seen them in Ameri∣ca.
If Seba's spotted chevrotain really came
from Surinam, we must presume that it had been
transported from Guiney, or some other south∣ern
region of the Old World. But there seems
to be a second species of chevrotain, different
from all those we have mentioned, which are
only simple varieties of the first. This second
species has horns, which are only an inch in
length, and as much in circumference. These
small horns are hollow, black, a little bended,
very sharp at the points, and surrounded at the
base with three or four transverse rings. In
the King's cabinet, we have the feet of this ani∣mal,
and one of its horns; and these parts de∣monstrate,
that it is either a chevrotain, or a
very minute gazelle. Kolbe, when mentioning
this species, says, that its horns were similar to
those of the stag, and that they have branches
in proportion to their age<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Congo, Viga, Guiney, and other places near the Cape of Good Hope, we find a species of goat which I call the <HI>Congo goat.</HI> It is not larger than a hare; but its beauty and symmetry are truly admirable.

They are mounted with gold or silver; <HI>Descript. du Cap de Bonne-espe∣rance, par Kolbe, tom. 3. p.</HI> 39.</NOTE>. This is an evident

blunder, as appears from a bare inspection of
the horns themselves.</P>
<P>The figure of these animals is elegant, and
their members are finely proportioned to their

We must, therefore, conclude, that there
are only two known species of chevrotains, the
memina, or Indian kind, without horns, and the
guevei or chevrotain of Guiney, with horns;
that the five species of Seba are only varieties of
the memina; and that the smallest kind, called
<HI>Guevei-kaior</HI> in Senegal, is only a variety of the
guevei.</P>
<P>None of these small animals can subsist, ex∣cept
in very warm climates. They are so ex∣tremely
delicate, that it is with the utmost dif∣ficulty
they can be transported alive into Europe,
where they soon perish. They are gentle, fa∣miliar,
and most beautifully shaped. Beyond all
comparison, they are the smallest cloven-footed
animals. From this last character, they should
produce but few young at a litter. From their
<PB N="29" REF="37"/>
minuteness, on the contrary, they ought to bring
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orth a great number. On this subject, we must
wait for information from those who have an
opportunity of observing their oeconomy. We
imagine that they bring forth but one or two at
a time, like the gazelles, roe-deer, &amp;c. But
perhaps they produce more frequently; for
they are very numerous in India, Java, Ceylon,
Senegal, Congo, and in all the very warm coun∣tries;
and none of them are found in America,
or in any of the temperate regions of the Old
Continent.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>We have here added the figure of a chevrotain,
which differs from that in the original work;
where it was remarked, that the skin of the
chevrotain is variegated with white spots, and
that Seba maintained that it was found in Suri∣nam.
It exists not, however, in America, but
in the East Indies, where it is called <HI>Memina.</HI>
Under this denomination, we received the skin
of a chevrotain from Ceylon, which had a per∣fect
resemblance to the description we had
given of it. By comparing this with our ori∣ginal
figure, we will perceive that none of these
animals have horns, and that they are both va∣rieties
only of the same species.</P>

They are not roebucks with horns solid

<P>To demonstrate what we have advanced, let
us suppose, that there are neither gazelles nor
chevrotains in New Spain, or in any other part
<PB N="34" REF="42"/>
of America; that there were no goats or ga∣zelles
in the New World before it was disco∣vered,
but that all those which are now there,
were transported thither from the Old Conti∣nent;
that the true mazame of Mexico is the
same animal with the Brasilian cuguacu-apara;
that the name <HI>cuguacu</HI> is pronounced <HI>couguacou;</HI>
and that, by a corruption, this animal was call∣ed
<HI>cariacou</HI> in Cayenne, from which it was
transmitted to us alive, under the denomination
of <HI>cariacou.</HI> We shall now endeavour to inve∣stigate
the species of the two animals to which
Seba has falsely applied the names <HI>mazame</HI> and
<HI>temamaçame;</HI> for, to destroy an error, it is not
enough to reject it; but its cause and effects must
also be exhibited.</P>
<P>The gazelles and chevrotains inhabit only the
warmest countries of the Old World. They
cannot subsist in temperate, and far less in cold
climates. Hence they could never frequent the
northern regions, nor pass, by means of these
regions, from the one Continent to the other.
No travellers, accordingly, or historians of the
New World ever pretend to have seen gazelles
or chevrotains in that quarter of the globe. The
stag and roebuck, on the contrary, are natives
of cold and temperate climates. They might,
therefore, pass, by means of the northern lands,
and, accordingly, they are found in both Con∣tinents.
In the history of the stag, it was
<PB N="35" REF="43"/>
shown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol. IV. article <HI>Stag.</HI></NOTE>, that the Canadian stag is the same with
the European; and that he is only smaller, and
has some trifling variations in the figure of his
horns and the colour of his hair. We may add
to what was then related, that there are as many
varieties among the American as among the
European stags; and yet they are all of the same
species. Of one of these varieties, namely, the
Corsican stag, we have given a figure<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See vol. IV. plate LII.</NOTE>. It is
smaller and browner than the common kind.
We have also mentioned white stags and hinds,
and have attributed this colour to their domestic
state: This kind is likewise found in America<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Inter cervorum genera quae apud novam hanc Hispani∣am adhuc mihi videre licuit (praeter candidos totos, quos reges Cervorum esse Indi sibi persuasere, nuncupantque a co∣colore <HI>Yztac mazame,</HI> et vocatos <HI>Tlamacaz quemacatl</HI>) primi sunt quos vacant <HI>Aculliame,</HI> Hispanicis omnino similes forma, magnitudine ac reliqua natura; minores his apparent <HI>Quauht maçame,</HI> sed usque adeo a caeterorum timiditate alieni, ut vul∣nerati homines ipsos adoriantur ac saepe numero interimant: Hos sequuntur magnitudine <HI>Tlalhuicamaçame,</HI> qui forma et moribus essent eis omnino similes, ni timidiores viderentur; Minimi omnium <HI>Temamaçame</HI> sunt; <HI>Nard.

than the former; but, in other respects,
they perfectly resemble each other, and both
<PB N="37" REF="45"/>
have palmated horns. The mazame of Mexico,
the cuguacu-apara of Brasil, and the cariacou, or
wood-hind, of Cayenne, have an entire resem∣blance
to our red roebucks. To be convinced
that all these nams denote the same animal, we
have only to compare the descriptions given un∣der
them. But the temamaçame, which, in our
opinion, is the cuguacu-été of Brasil, the small
cariacou or Savannah hind of Cayenne, may
be only a variety different from those of Europe.
The temamaçame is smaller, and has also a whi∣ter
belly, than the mazame, in the same manner
as our brown roebuck is smaller, and has a whi∣ter
belly than the red kind. It appears likewise
to differ from the mazame in its horns, which
are simple, and without antlers, in the figure
given by Recchi. But, if it be considered, that,
in our roebucks and stags, the horns have no
antlers during the first and sometimes the second
year of their age, we will be led to believe that
Recchi's temamaçame was too young to have
antlers. Hence these two animals seem to be
only varieties of the roebuck species, which will
be still farther apparent from comparing the fi∣gures
and descriptions of the different authors
we have quoted, with the figure here given of
a cariacou which was sent us from Cayenne, and
which we nourished in Burgundy for several
years.</P>
<P>It now remains to investigate the two animals
exhibited by Seba under the false appellations
<PB N="38" REF="46"/>
of <HI>mazame</HI> and <HI>temamaçame.</HI> The bare inspec∣tion
of the figures, independent of his descrip∣tion,
which we have inserted above in the notes,
show that these animals belong to the goats or
gazelles, and by no means to the stages or roebucks.
The want of a beard, and the figure of the horns,
prove that they are not goats, but gazelles; and,
by comparing Seba's figures with the gazelles I
have described, I discovered, that his pretended
<HI>temamaçame of New Spain</HI> is the <HI>Kob,</HI> or <HI>small
brown cow of Senegal.</HI> The figure, colour, and
size of the horns are the same. The colour of
the hair, which differs from other gazelles, by
being yellow, instead of white, on the belly and
flanks, is also the same. With regard to his
pretended <HI>mazame,</HI> though it has a general re∣semblance
to the gazelles, it differs remarkably
from all those we have formerly enumerated.
But we have found, in the cabinet of M. Adan∣son,
which contains the rarest productions of
Senegal, a stuffed animal, which we called <HI>Nagor,</HI>
on account of the resemblance of its horns to
those of the nanguer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Capra a D. Andriot missa. Differt a nanguer. Longi∣tudo ab apice rostri ad anum quatuor fere pedum; ab ano ad pectus duo pedes cum dimidio.

<P>THE class of ruminating quadrupeds is the
most numerous, and the most diversified.
It comprehends, as we have seen, a great num∣ber
of species, and perhaps a still greater num∣ber
of distinct races, or permanent varieties.
Notwithstanding all our researches, and the la∣borious
details into which we have been obliged
to enter, we freely acknowledge that the sub∣ject
is by no means exhausted, and that there
still remain animals of considerable note which
we know only by imperfect fragments, and are un∣able
to ascertain the creatures to which they be∣long.
For example, in the very large collection
of horns preserved in the royal cabinet, as well
<PB N="41" REF="52"/>
as in private museums, each of which, after
much labour and investigation, we have refer∣red
to the animal to whom it belongs, except
one, which, having neither ticket nor any o∣ther
artificial mark of information, is absolutely
unknown. This horn is very large, almost
straight, and composed of a thick, black sub∣stance.
It is not solid, like that of the stag; but
it is a hollow horn, filled with a bone or core,
like the horns of oxen. A thick rib, raised a∣bout
an inch, runs from the base to above the
middle of the horn. Though the horn be
straight, this prominent rib makes a spiral turn
and a half in the inferior part, and is entirely ef∣faced
in the superior part, which terminates in
a point. Upon the whole, this horn seems to
have a greater relation to those of the buffalo
than to any other. But we are ignorant of the
name of the animal; and it was not till lately,
that, in searching different cabinets, we found,
in that of M. Duplex, a fragment of a head
with two similar horns, to which the following
ticket was fixed: <HI>“Horns of an animal somewhat
like a horse, of a grayish colour, with a mane
on the fore part of the head like a horse. It is
called here (at Pondicherry) Coesdoes, which
should be pronounced</HI> Coudous.” This little
discovery gave us great joy. We could not,
however, find the name <HI>coesdoes</HI> or coudous, in
the writings of any voyager. We learned from
the ticket alone, that this animal is very large,
<PB N="42" REF="53"/>
and that he is a native of the warmest countries
of Asia. The buffalo belongs to the same cli∣mate,
and has also a mane on the top of his head.
His horns, it is true, are crooked and flat, while
those under consideration are round and straight,
which, as well as the colour, sufficiently distin∣guishes
these two animals; for the skin and the
hair of the buffalo are black, and, according to
the ticket, the hair of the coudous is grayish.
These relations suggested others: The travellers
into Asia mention large buffaloes of Bengal,
reddish buffaloes, and grayish buffaloes of the
Mogul empire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the hunting of the nil-gauts or gray oxen, which, in my opinion, are a species of elk, there is nothing particular, &amp;c.; <HI>Voyage de Bernier, tom. 2. p.</HI> 245.</NOTE>, called <HI>nil-gauts.</HI> The coudous
is perhaps one or other of these animals. From
the travellers into Africa, where the buffaloes
are as common as in Asia, we have more point∣ed
information with regard to a species of buf∣falo
called <HI>pacasse</HI> in Congo, which seems to be
the coudous: “Upon the route from Louanda
to the kingdom of Congo, we perceived<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Relation de Congo par les P. P. Michel-Ange de Gal∣line &amp; Denys de Charly de Plaisance, Capucins, p. 77.</NOTE> two

appeared to be the buffalo. It is in fact a
species of buffalo, differing from him in the
figure of the horns and colour of the hair. In
a word, the pacassa is the coudous, which per∣haps
constitutes a different species from that
of the buffalo, and perhaps is only a variety
of it.</P>

<P>To finish the history of the goats, gazelles,
chevrotains, and other animals, of this
kind, which are all natives of the Old Conti∣nent,
<PB N="45" REF="56"/>
it now only remains to give that of the
musk, an animal as famous as it is little known.
It has been mentioned by all our modern natu∣ralists,
and by most travellers into Asia. Some
of them have considered it as a <HI>stag,</HI> a <HI>roebuck,</HI>
or a <HI>musk goat,</HI> and others as a large <HI>chevrotain.</HI>
It seems indeed to be an ambiguous animal,
participating of the nature of all these species.
We may be assured, however, that its species is
distinct, and different from all the other qua∣drupeds.
It is of the size of a small roebuck;
but has no horns. By this character, it resem∣bles
the <HI>memina</HI> or Indian musk. It has two
large tusks in the upper jaw, by which it ap∣proaches
to the Guiney musk. But, what di∣stinguishes
the musk from all other animals, is a
kind of bag near its navel, about two or three
inches in diameter, in which the liquor, or ra∣ther
fat humour called <HI>musk,</HI> is separated, and
which differs both in odour and consistence from
that of the civet. Neither the Greeks nor Ro∣mans
mention this animal. It was first taken
notice of by the Arabians<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Abusseid Serafi remarks, that the musk animal resembles the roebuck in the skin and colour, in the slenderness of the legs, in the hoofs, in the <HI>erect and somewhat bended horns;</HI> and that it is armed with two white tusks on the side of each cheek. This author is single in asserting that the musk animal has horns; he has perhaps conjectured from ana∣logy, that, as it resembled the roebuck in other respects, it ought likewise to have horns. We have taken notice of this error, because it is copied by Aldrovandus. Avicenna, when speaking of the <HI>musk,</HI> says, that it is the purse or follicle of an animal pretty similar to the roebuck, only it has two large crooked tusks. There is a figure of this animal in the fragment of Cosmas, printed in the first volume of Tavernier's travels.</NOTE>. Gesner, Aldro∣vandus,

Kircher<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I say, in the first place, that there is a certain stag in the provinces of Xensi and Chiamsi, which has a fine odour, and is called by the Chinese <HI>Xerchiam,</HI> that is, the <HI>musk animal.</HI> The Chinese Atlas mentions it in the following terms: “To keep you no longer in suspense concerning the signification of the word <HI>muschus,</HI> I can assure you that I have seen the animal oftener than once. It has a protuberance near the nevel which resembles a small purse, because it is surrounded with a very delicate skin, and covered with soft hair. The Chinese call this animal <HI>Xe,</HI> which signifies <HI>odour,</HI> and the compound word <HI>Xehiang</HI> denotes the odour of the animal <HI>Xe,</HI> or <HI>Se,</HI> muschus.” It is four feet long, and as swift as a stag. The only difference is, that its hair is blacker, and it has no horns. The Chinese eat its flesh, which is very delicate. The provinces of Suchuen and Junnan abound with these animals, and they are most numerous in the western provinces of China; <HI>La Chine illustrée de Kircher, p.</HI> 256.</NOTE>, and Boym have treated pret∣ty
fully of this animal; but Grew<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The musk deer breeds in China and the East Indies. Not ill pictured in Calceolarius's museum. That in Kircher's <HI>China illustrata</HI> faulty as to the snout and feet. That of John∣ston absurd. Almost every where worse described. That he is a two-horned animal, says Aldrovandus, all agree, ex∣cept Simeon Sethi, who saith he hath but one. Neither of which is true. The description likewise given by Scaliger, and out of him by Chiocco in Calceolarius's museum, is false, and very defective. The best I find is amongst the German Transactions; to which I would have referred the reader, but that, comparing it with that I had drawn up before I met with it, I see some differences.</P>
<P>From his nose and to his tail, a yard and half a foot long. His head above half a foot. His neck one fourth of a yard. His fore-head three inches broad. His nose-end scarce three fourths of an inch, being very sharp, like that of a gray∣hound. His ears like a coney's, about three inches long, and erect. As also his tail or scut, which exceeds not two inches. His fore-legs a foot and two inches long, taking in foot and thigh. Near an inch over; the foot deeply cloven; with two fore hoofs, an inch and a quarter long, each a quarter of an inch over; and two heels almost as big, and therefore con∣spicuous. His hinder-feet are here wanting.</P>
<P>His hair on his head and legs about half an inch long, and rateably small. On his belly, an inch and a half long, and somewhat thicker. On his back and buttocks three inches long, thicker in proportion than any other animal, except, perhaps, some of the deer-kind, <HI>sc.</HI> three or four times as thick as hogs bristles; consisting of brown and white portions alternately from the root to the top. On the head and legs brown. On the belly and under the scut, whitish. As it were frizled, especially on the back and belly, by a kind of undulation. Softer than in most animals, and exceeding light and rare. For, being split, and covered with a gloss, they appear to be made up of little bladders, like those in the plume or stalk of a quill; so that it is a thing betwixt a common hair and a quill. On each side his lower chop, almost under the corner of his mouth, there is a peculiar tuft, (about three fourths of an inch long,) of short, thick, and hard hairs, or rather bristles, of equal length, as in a scrubbing brush.</P>
<P>The musk bladder or bag is about three inches long, two over, and swelling out from his belly one and a half. Stand∣ing before his groin about as much. I find it cut open, whereby the observation of its natural aperture (which I sup∣pose it hath as the castor bag) is prevented.</P>
<P>He hath twenty-six teeth. In his lower chop, sixteen; of which there are eight little cutters before; behind four grin∣ders on each side, rugged and continuous. As many like grinders in the upper jaw. About an inch and a half from the nose-end, in the same jaw, on each side a tusk, two inches and a half long, hooked downward, and backward, and end∣ing in a point.

This description I have copied in the note. The
<PB N="48" REF="59"/>
year after the publication of Grew's work, in
1681, Luc Schrockius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Schrockius gives a figure, but no description of this ani∣mal. He only remarks, that it resembles a roebuck, with the exception of having two prominent tusks in the upper jaw, about three inches long, and directed downward; that this is the chief characteristic of the animal; that it varies in the colour of its hair; that its head likewise differs from the roe∣buck, and approaches to that of the wolf; that the hair is generally marked with several spots; and that the protu∣berance which contains the <HI>musk</HI> is situated a little below the navel. He adds, that this animal is found in Tartary, in Ti∣bet, in China, and particularly in the province of Xinsi, in Tonquin, in Pegu, in the kingdom of Aracan, and in Bou∣tan; p. 32.—<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7.</NOTE> printed, at Vienna, the
history of this animal, which contains nothing
remarkable either for correctness or novelty. I
shall, however, combine the facts which can be
gathered from it with those of other authors,
and particularly the more modern travellers.
Having never been able to procure the animal
<PB N="49" REF="60"/>
itself, we are reduced to the necessity of collec∣ting
and digesting what has been said of it by
others. From Grew's description, which is the
only authentic work we are possessed of, it appears
that this animal has long coarse hair, a sharp
muzzle, and tusks like those of a hog; and that,
by these characters, it approaches the wild boar,
or rather the <HI>babiroussa,</HI> called the <HI>wild Indian
boar</HI> by the naturalists, which, along with se∣veral
characters of the hog, is, like the musk a∣nimal,
smaller, and has taller and more nimble
limbs, resembling those of the stag or roebuck.
On the other hand, the American hog, which
we have called <HI>pecari,</HI> has on his back a cavity
or purse which contains an odoriferous humour;
and the musk animal has a similar purse, not
on his back, but under his belly. In general,
none of those animals which produce odorous
liquors, as the badger, the beaver, the pecari,
the musk rats, and the civet, belong to the genus
of deer or goats. Hence we would be led to
think, that the musk animal makes a nearer ap∣proach
to the hog-kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Animal moschiserum neque e cervino neque e caprino genere esse videtur; cornua enim non habet, et an ruminet incertum est; dentibus tamen incisoribus in superiore mandi∣bula caret ruminantium in modum, et dentes ibidem exertos habet, (<HI>Tusks</HI> Anglice, <HI>defenses</HI> Gallice,) velut porcus; <HI>Raii Syn. quad. p.</HI> 127.</NOTE>, of which he has the
tusks, if, at the same time, he had cutting teeth
in the upper jaw. But, his want of these teeth
connects him with the ruminating animals, and
<PB N="50" REF="61"/>
particularly with the chevrotain, which chews
the cud, though it has no horns. All these exter∣nal
characters, however, furnish us with con∣jectures
only. But an examination of the in∣ternal
parts can alone decide concerning the na∣ture
of this animal, which to this day is very
little known. I have made it follow the goats
and antilopes, not because it seems to have any
connection with these species, but lest I should
too much offend the prejudices of most natu∣ralists.</P>
<P>Marco Paolo, Barbosa, and P. Philippe the Ma∣rini,
are all more or less deceived in the notices
they have given concerning this animal.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Paolo describes it in this manner. Its hair is coarse, like that of the stag: It has the feet and tail of a gazelle, and no horns <HI>any more than that animal.</HI> It has <HI>four</HI> teeth in the upper jaw, about three inches long, which are as de∣licate and white as ivory; two of them rise upward, and two turn downward; and the creature is exceedingly beautiful. During <HI>the full moon,</HI> it is affected with an imposthume on the belly near the navel; and at this time the hunters seize the animal, and open this imposthume. Barbosa says, that it is very like the gazelle; but he agrees not with other au∣thors, when he tells us that its hair is white. The follow∣ing are his words: “The <HI>musk</HI> is found in small white animals which resemble gazelles, and have tusks like elephants, though much smaller. A kind of imposthume forms under the belly and breast of these animals, and, when the matter is ripe, the tumour grows so itchy, that they rub it against the trees: The matter which falls down in small grains is the most per∣fect <HI>musk.”</HI> Thevenot's description seems to correspond still better with the others. “In these countries,” says he, “there is an animal with a muzzle similar to that of the fox, but whose body exceeds not the size of a hare. His hair resembles that of the stag, and he has the teeth of a dog: He pro∣duces excellent musk in a bladder under the belly, which is full of corrupted blood; and this blood composes, or rather is the musk itself. The natives cut away this bladder, and cover the cut part of it with leather, to prevent the dissipa∣tion of the odour. But, after this operation, the animal soon dies.” The description given by Pigafetta, who says that the musk is of the size of a cat, corresponds not with that of other authors; neither does that of P. Philippe, who makes the head of the musk resemble the head of a wolf: And P. Kircher, in the figure he has given of this animal, re∣presents it with the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>out of a hog, which is perhaps an er∣ror of the engraver, who has likewise given it claws instead of cloven hoofs. Simeon Sethi recedes still farther from truth, when he makes the musk as large as an unicorn, and even a species of it. “The <HI>musk</HI> of least value,” says he, “is brought from China and the East Indies, and is of a blackish colour. The <HI>musk</HI> is formed below the navel of a large ani∣mal with one horn, and which has a resemblance to the roe∣buck. In the rutting season, a mass of clotted blood collects round his navel, and produces a swelling, the pain of which prevents him from eating or drinking: He then rolls him∣self on the earth, breaks the tumour, and discharges the blood, which, after coagulating, acquires a fine odour.” All these authors agree in the manner in which the <HI>musk</HI> is formed in a bladder or tumour near the navel, when the ani∣mal ruts; <HI>Anciennes relations des Indes &amp; de la Chine, p.</HI> 216.</NOTE>. The
<PB N="51" REF="62"/>
only fact in which they agree is, that the <HI>musk</HI>
is formed in a pouch or tumour near the navel;
and it appears from their testimonies, as well
as those of other travellers, that the male alone
produces the <HI>musk;</HI> that the female has the same
pouch near the navel, but that the humour se∣creted
in it has not the same odour; that this tu∣mour
of the male is not filled with <HI>musk,</HI> except in
the rutting season; and that, at other times,
<PB N="52" REF="63"/>
the quantity of this humour is smaller, and its
odour weaker.</P>
<P>With regard to the <HI>musk</HI> itself, its essence is
perhaps as little known as the nature of the
animal from which it is procured. All travel∣lers
agree, that this drug is perpetually adultera∣ted
with blood, or other drugs, by the venders.
The Chinese not only augment its size by mix∣ture,
but they endeavour to increase its weight
by incorporating finely powdered lead with it.
The <HI>musk</HI> which is purest, and in most request
among the Chinese themselves, is that which
drops spontaneously from the animal upon stones
or trunks of trees, against which it rubs, when
the matter is too abundant, or begins to irritate
the pouch where it is formed: That found
in the pouch itself is seldom so good; because it
is not fully ripe, or rather because it is during
the rutting season only it acquires its greatest
strength and odour; and, at this period, the ani∣mal
endeavours to get rid of a matter which is
too highly exalted, and occasions itching and
some degree of pain. Both Chardin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is well known, that <HI>musk</HI> is the excrementitious matter of an animal which resembles the wild goat, except that its body and limbs are more delicate. It is found in High Tar∣tary, in the north of China, and in Tibet, which is a king∣dom between India and China. I never saw these animals a∣live, but I have seen their skins in many places. There are fi∣gures of them in the Dutch ambassador's lodgings at China, and in the <HI>China illustrata</HI> of Kircher. It is commonly said, that the <HI>musk</HI> is the sweat of the animal, which runs down and is collected in a thin bladder near the navel. But the na∣tives of the East tell us with more precision, that it is formed in an abscess within the body, and near the navel of this goat, the humour of which produces an itching and prickling pain, especially when the animal is in season; that, by rubbing a∣gainst trees or rocks, the abscess bursts, and the matter is dif∣fused between the muscles and the skin, where it collects and forms a kind of blister or bladder; and that the internal heat exalts this corrupted blood, and gives it the strong odour of <HI>musk.</HI> This bladder is called <HI>the navel of the musk,</HI> or <HI>the odori∣ferous navel.</HI> The Eastern people prefer the Tibet <HI>musk</HI> to that of China, whether it is really a stronger odour, or only ap∣pears so, because it arrives to them fresher, Tibet being near∣er to them than the province of Xinsi, which produces more <HI>musk</HI> than any other district of China. The great <HI>musk</HI> trade is carried on at Boutan, a celebrated town in the kingdom of Tibet. The Patans go there to purchase it; and they dis∣tribute it over all India, from whence it is transported through the whole earth. The Patans border on Persia and High Tar∣tary, and are subject or rather tributary to the Great Mogul. The Indians make great use of this aromatic drug. They employ it in their perfumes, confections, and every composi∣tion they have been accustomed to prepare for the purposes of provoking love, or of restoring lost vigour. The women use it to dissipate the vapours which ascend from the ute∣rus to the brain; by fixing a bladder of it on their navel; and, when the vapours are violent and perpetual, they take the <HI>musk</HI> out of the bladder, tie it in a small linen bag, and apply it to a place which modesty permits not to be named.—It is commonly alledged, that, when the musk∣bag is cut open, so strong an odour bursts out, that the hun∣ter is obliged to have his mouth and nose covered with seve∣ral folds of linen; and that, notwithstanding this precaution, the force of the odour is often so great as to produce a mor∣tal haemorrhagy. I made a particular inquiry into this fact, and, having heard similiar accounts from some Armenians who had been at Boutan, I am inclined to think it is true; because this drug, instead of acquiring, loses its odour in process of time. Now this odour is so strong in India, that I was unable to bear it. When I dealt in <HI>musk,</HI> I stood always in the open air, with a handkerchief on my face, and at a distance from those who handled the bladders, and brought them to my broker. I then perceived that <HI>musk,</HI> when fresh, is ex∣tremely heady, and quite insupportable. I shall only add, that there is no drug so easily or so frequently adulterated. Some bags are only pieces of the animal's skin, filled with its blood, and a small quantity of <HI>musk</HI> to give it an odour, instead of that bladder formed by the wisdom of Nature near the na∣vel to receive this wonderful and odoriferous humour. With regard to the genuine bladders, when the hunters find that they are not full, they squeeze the animal's belly, and fill them with blood; for they believe that the blood of the musk, and even its flesh, has a fine scent. The merchants afterwards mix the <HI>musk</HI> with lead, ox's blood, and other substances pro∣per for augmenting its weight. The Eastern people employ several modes of detecting this falsification, without opening the bag: They learn from experience to distinguish the pro∣per weight of an unadulte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ated bag. They likewise know by the taste. Hence the Indians never purchase <HI>musk</HI> without ta∣sting small grains of it, which they squeeze out of the bags. In fine, they take a thread steeped in garlick juice, and draw it through the bag with a needle: If the odour of the gar∣lick be extinguished, the <HI>musk</HI> is good, and if the thread pre∣serves the scent of the garlick, the <HI>musk</HI> is adulterated; <HI>Voyage de Chardin, tom. 2. p.</HI> 16.</NOTE> and Ta∣vernier
<PB N="53" REF="64"/>
have well described the methods prac∣tised
by the Orientals to adulterate <HI>musk.</HI> The
<PB N="54" REF="65"/>
merchants must necessarily augment the quantity
of it beyond conception; for, in one year, Ta∣vernier
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The best, and the greatest quantities of <HI>musk</HI> come from the kingdom of <HI>Boutan,</HI> from which it is carried for sale to Patna, the chief town of Bengal. All the <HI>musk</HI> sold in Persia is transported from thence. I had the curiosity to carry a skin of this animal to Paris, and have given a figure of it.</P>
<P>After killing the animal, the peasants cut off the bag, which is of the size of an egg, and is situated nearer the or∣gans of generation than the navel. They next take out the <HI>musk,</HI> which then has the appearance of clotted blood. When they want to adulterate it, they put a mash of the animal's liver and blood in the place of the musk they had extracted. In two or three years, this mixture produces certain small a∣nimals which eat the good <HI>musk;</HI> so that, when opened, a great defalcation is discovered. Others, after extracting a portion of the musk, put in small pieces of lead, to augment the weight. The merchants who transport <HI>musk</HI> to foreign countries love this trick better than the other, because none of these small animals are produced by it. But the deceit is still worse to discover, when, of the skin taken from the belly of a young animal they make little bags, which they sew so dexterously with threads of the same skin, that they resemble genuine bags. These they fill with what they take out of the genuine bags, and some fraudulent mixture, which it is ex∣tremely difficult for the merchants to detect. When the bags are fewed immediately upon their being cut, without allow∣ing any part of the odour to dissipate in the air, after they have abstracted as much of the <HI>musk</HI> as they think proper, if a person applies one of these bags to his nose, blood will be drawn by the mere force of the odour, which must neces∣sarily be weakened or diluted, in order to render it agreeable, without injuring the brain. The odour of the animal I brought to Paris was so strong, that it was impossible to keep it in my chamber. It made every head in the house giddy; and I was obliged to put it in a barn, where my servants at last cut away the bag: The skin, notwithstanding, always retained a portion of the odour. These animals are not found in a lower latitude than the fifty sixth degree. But in the sixtieth they are very numerous, the country being full of woods. In the months of February and March, it is true, after suffering much hunger in their favourite clime, on ac∣count of the snow, which is sometimes ten or twelve feet deep, they come southward as far as the forty-fourth or forty-fifth degree, in order to procure grain, or fresh rice. During this period, the peasants lie in wait for these animals with snares, and kill them with arrows and bludgeons. Some of them, I was assured, are so meagre and languishing with the hunger they suffer, that they are easily taken. These ani∣mals must be extremely numerous; for each of them has but one bag, and the largest bag, which seldom exceeds the size of a hen's egg, cannot furnish above half an ounce of <HI>musk:</HI> Three or four of them are sometimes necessary to afford a single ounce.</P>
<P>The King of Dantan, apprehensive that the practice of adulterating the <HI>musk</HI> would injure the commerce of his king∣dom, especially as it is also produced, though dearer and in less quality, in Tonquin and Cochinchina, ordered, some time ago, that none of the bags should be sewed, but that the whole of them should be brought open to Boutan, the place of his residence, to be examined and sealed with his own seal. All those I purchased were of this kind. But, notwithstanding all the precautions of the King, the peasants open the bags in a crafty manner, and put into them small pieces of lead, which the merchants tolerate, because lead, as formerly re∣marked, does not spoil the <HI>musk,</HI> but only augments the weight. In one of my voyages to Patna, I purchased 1663 bags, which weighed 2557 ounces and a half; and the <HI>musk,</HI> when taken out of the bags, weighed 452 ounces; <HI>Les six voyages de Jean-Baptiste Tavernier en Turquie, en Perse, &amp; a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x Indes, tom. 4. p.</HI> 75.</P></NOTE> purchased 1663 bags, which supposes

<P>THOUGH we have only the head of this
animal in the Royal Cabinet, it is too re∣markable
to be passed over in silence. All na∣turalists
have regarded it as a species of hog;
and yet it has neither the head, the stature, the
bristles, nor the tail of a hog. Its legs are long∣er,
and its muzzle shorter. It is covered with
short hair, as soft as wool, and its tail terminates
<PB N="59" REF="70"/>
in a tuft. Its body, likewise, is neither so heavy
nor so thick as that of the hog. Its hair is gray,
mixed with red and a little black. Its ears are
short and pointed. But the most remarkable
character, which distinguishes the babiroussa
fom all other animals, consists in four large
tusks or canine teeth, the two shortest of which
proceed, like those of the wild boar, from the
under jaw, and the two longest, by piercing the
cheeks, or rather the lips, from the upper jaw,
and extend in a curve above the eyes. These
tusks are a beautiful ivory, which is cleaner and
finer, but not so hard as that of the elephant.</P>
<P>The direction of the two superior tusks, which
first rise high and then bend in the form of a
circle, induced some able natural philosophers,
such as Grew<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On his upper jaw, he has two horns—<HI>Bartholine</HI> calls them teeth, yet are they not teeth, but <HI>horns;</HI> because they are not, as all teeth, even the tusks of an <HI>elephant,</HI> fixed in the jaw, with their roots upward, but downward: And so their <HI>alveoli</HI> are not open downward within the mouth, but upward upon the top of the snout, &amp;c.; <HI>Grew's Mus. Reg. soc. p.</HI> 28.</NOTE>, to think, that these tusks ought
not to be regarded as teeth, but as horns. They
founded their opinion upon this circumstance,
<PB N="60" REF="71"/>
that, in all animals, the sockets of the teeth in
the upper jaw open downward; that, in the
babiroussa, all the sockets likewise open down∣ward,
except those of the two great tusks, which
open upward; and hence they conclude, that,
from this essential character of the upper teeth,
these tusks, whose sockets open upward, cannot
be regarded as teeth, but as horns. These phi∣losophers,
however, were deceived. Position
or direction are circumstances by no means es∣sential
to the existence of an object. These
tusks, though situated in a manner opposite to
that of other teeth, are still teeth; the singulari∣ty
of their direction cannot alter their nature,
or convert a true canine tooth into an ivory
horn.</P>
<P>These enormous quadruple tusks give this a∣nimal
a formidable appearance; yet he is less
dangerous, perhaps, than our wild boar. They
go in herds, and have a strong odour, which be∣trays
them to the dogs, who often hunt them
with success. They growl in a frightful man∣ner
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mus. Worm. p. 340. Pison. Apend. in Bont. p. 61.</NOTE>, and fight and defend themselves with
their under tusks, the upper ones being rather
incommodious than serviceable to them. Though
brutal and ferocious, they are easily tamed; and
their flesh, which is very good, corrupts in a
short time. As their hair is fine and their skin
thin, they make little resistance against the teeth
<PB N="61" REF="72"/>
of the dogs, who hunt them in preference to the
boar, and accomplish their purpose with ease.
In order to rest their head, or to sleep in a stand∣ing
posture, they hook their upper tusks to the
branches of trees<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descript. des Indes Orient. par Franc. Valentin, tom. 3. p. 268.</NOTE>. This practice is common
to them and the elephant, which, to repose
without lying down, supports its head by put∣ing
the ends of its tusks into holes that it digs
for this purpose in the wall of its apartment<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See above, art. <HI>Elephant.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The babiroussa differs likewise from the wild
boar in natural appetites. He feeds upon herbs
and the leaves of trees, and never enters the gardens
to devour pot-herbs: But the boar, even in
the same country, lives upon wild fruits and roots,
and often lays waste the gardens. Besides, these
animals, which go equally in herds, never inter∣mix;
the wild boars keep to one side, and the
babiroussas to the other. The latter walk light∣ly,
have a very fine scent, and often rise erect
against the trees, in order to smell at a distance
the approach of dogs or hunters. When hard
pursued, they run into the sea, where, by swim∣ming
with as much facility as ducks, and even
diving, they often escape the hunters; for they
swim a long time, and sometimes to great di∣stances
from one island to another.</P>
<P>The babiroussa is found not only in the island
of Bouro or Boero, near Amboina, but in seve∣ral

<P>THIS animal was never seen in Europe,
till the Duke de Bouillon had a young
one transmitted to him from America. As this
Prince is exceedingly curious with regard to
foreign animals, he has sometimes done me the
honour to inviting me to examine them, and has
even been kind enough to present me with se∣veral
<PB N="65" REF="77"/>
species. The animal under consideration
was killed by the coldness of the climate before it
had acquired its full growth. It is not a hog,
as is been alledged by naturalists and travel∣lers;
for it has only some slight relations to
the hog, and differs from him in some remark∣able
characters. The cabiai never exceeds the
size of a hog of eighteen months old. Its head
is shorter, and its mouth less. Its feet are also
very different from those of the hog; for its toes
are connected by membranes. It has larger
eyes and shorter ears. In dispositions and man∣ners,
it differs not less from the hog, than in the
structure of its parts. It lives much in the water,
where it swims like an otter, catches fishes with
its mouth and feet, and eats them on the banks.
It likewise eats grain, fruits, and sugar canes.
As its feet are long and broad, it often sits on
the hind ones. Instead of the grunting of a hog,
its cry rather resembles the braying of an ass. It
seldom walks but in the night, and then gene∣rally
in company, without removing far from
the margin of the water. As it runs badly, on
account of the length of its feet, and the short∣ness
of its legs, its safety consists not in flight.
To escape the hunters, it plunges into the water,
swims to a great distance, and remains so long
concealed that they lose all hopes of getting an∣other
view of it. The flesh of it is fat and
tender; but, like that of the other, it has ra∣ther
the taste of bad fish than of good flesh. It
<PB N="66" REF="78"/>
has been remarked, however, that its head is
pretty good, which corresponds with what is
said of the beaver, that the flesh of its anterior
parts is well tasted, while that of the posterior
parts has the taste of fish. The cabiai is of a
gentle and peaceable disposition; it neither quar∣rels,
nor does mischief to other animals. It is
easily tamed, obeys the voice, and follows spon∣taneously
those with whom it is acquainted, and
who treat it kindly. At Paris, it was fed with bar∣ley,
salads, and fruits, and continued in good
condition during the warm season. From the great
number of paps, it appears, that the female is
very prolific. We are ignorant of the times of
gestation and growth, and consequently of the
duration of its life. Our colonists at Cayenne
might inform us with regard to these articles;
for this animal is pretty common in Guiana,
as well as in Brasil, the country of the Ama∣zons,
and other low lands of South America.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>We have little to add to the history and de∣scription
of this American animal. M. de la
Borde writes us, that it is very common in
Guiana, and still more so in the neighbourhood
<PB N="67" REF="79"/>
of the Amazon river, where the fishes are ve∣ry
numerous. He ramarks, that these animals
go always in pairs, a male and a female; and
that the largest of them weigh about a hundred
pounds. They fly from the abodes of men,
never leave the banks of rivers, and, when
they perceive any person, they take to the wa∣ter,
without diving like the otters, but swimming
like the hogs. Sometimes, however, they go
to the bottom, and continue there a considerable
time. They are often taken when young, and
brought up in the houses, where they easily ac∣custom
themselves to eat bread, millet, and pot-herbs,
though, in a state of nature, they live
chiefly on fish. The females bring forth only
one young at a time. They are by no means
dangerous; for they never attack either men or
dogs. Their flesh in white, tender, and well
tasted. This last fact seems to contradict what
is said by other travellers, that the flesh of the
cabiai has rather the taste of bad fish, than of
good meat. However, the flesh of the cabiai,
when it lives on fish, may have this bad taste,
and, when fed with bread or grain, it may be
very good.</P>
<P>As we had this animal alive in Paris, and
kept it a long time, I am persuaded that it
might be propagated in our climate. I men∣tioned
above, p. 65. that it was killed by the
cold. But I have since been informed, that it
<PB N="68" REF="80"/>
endured the winter's cold very well; but, as
it was shut up in a garret, it threw itself down
from the window, and fell into a vessel full of
water, where it was drowned; which would not
have happened, if it had not been hurt in the
fall upon the edge of the vessel.

<P>THE name given to this animal in most
European languages leads to the notion
that it is a hog covered with bristles, though it
has no resemblance to the hog but in the grunt∣ing
<PB N="70" REF="83"/>
noise it makes. It differs from the hog as
much as any other quadruped, both in figure
and internal structure. Instead of a long head,
furnished with long ears, armed with tusks, and
terminated by a snout; instead of cloven feet,
covered with hoofs, like the hog; the porcu∣pine
has a short head, like the beaver, two large
cutting teeth in each jaw, no tusks or canine
teeth, the upper lip divided like that of the hare,
round flat ears, and feet armed with claws. In∣stead
of a large stomach with an appendix shaped
like a cowl, which, in the hog, seems to form
the shade between the ruminating and other
quadrupeds, the porcupine has only a simple
stomach and a large caecum. The parts of ge∣neration
are not apparent, as in the boar; and
the testicles are hid in the groins. From these
characters, joined to the short tail, the long
whiskers, and the divided lip, we may conclude
that the porcupine makes a nearer approach to
the hare, or the beaver, than the hog. The
hedgehog, which, like the porcupine, is armed
with prickles, has a greater resemblance to the
hog; for its muzzle is long, and terminates in
a kind of snout. But, all these resemblances
being slight, and the differences conspicuous, the
porcupine unquestionably constitutes a particu∣lar
species, totally distinct from that of the
hedgehog, the beaver, the hare, or any other
animal to which fancy may compare it.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="84"/>
Travellers and naturalists have attributed to
the porcupine the faculty of darting its quills to
a distance, and with such force as to inflict deep
wounds: They have likewise said, that the quills,
when separated from the body of the animal,
possess the extraordinary power of penetrating,
by their own proper exertion, deeper into the
flesh, as soon as their points have entered. This
last fact is purely imaginary, and the first is e∣qually
false as the second. The error seems to
have originated from this circumstance, that the
porcupine, when irritated, erects and moves his
quills; and, as some of them are attached to
the skin only by a delicate pedicle, they easily
fall off. We have examined living porcupines,
and, though violently agitated, we never saw
them discharge their quills like darts. It is not
a little surprising, therefore, that the gravest
authors, both antient<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Arist. hist. anim. lib. 9. cap. 39. Plin. hist. nat. lib. 8. cap. 53. Oppian. de venatione.</NOTE> and modern<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Those quills, say the anatomists of the academy of sci∣ences, which were strongest and shortest, easily parted from the skin, being less firmly attached to it than the others. These are likewise the quills which the porcupines dart a∣gainst the hunters, by shaking their skin as dogs do when they come out of the water. Claudian, in the same manner, re∣marks, that the porcupine is himself the bow, the quiver, and the arrow, which he employs against the hunters; <HI>Mem. pour servir à l'hist. des animaux, tom. 3. p. 114. Note.</HI> Fable is the province of the poet; and therefore Claudian merits no reproach. But the anatomists of the academy should not have adopted this fable, which they seem to have done for no other purpose than that of quoting Claudian; for, from their own account, it appears that the porcupine does not dart his quills to a distance, but that they only fall off when he shakes himself; <HI>Wormius, Mus. Wormian. p. 235. Wotton. p. 56. Aldrov. de quad. digit. p.</HI> 473<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and several other respectable writers, have adopted this error.</NOTE>, as well
<PB N="72" REF="85"/>
as the most sensible travellers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tavernier, tom. 2. p. 20. Kolbe, tom 3. p. 46. Barbot, Hist. gen. des voyages, tom. 4. p. 237.</NOTE>, should join in
giving their suffrages to a falsehood. Some of
them tell us, that they themselves have been
wounded by these darts: Others affirm, that the
quills are discharged with such violence as to
pierce a plank at the distance of several paces<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">When the porcupine is enraged, he darts his quills, which are sometimes two spans in length, with such rapidity and force, against men and other animals, that they will pierce a plank of wood; <HI>Voyage en Guinée, par Bosman, p.</HI> 253.</NOTE>.
The marvellous always augments and gathers
force in proportion to the number of heads
through which it passes. Truth, on the contra∣ry,
loses in performing the same route. Not∣withstanding
the absolute negative I have stamp∣ed
on these two fictions, I am persuaded that it
will still be repeated by a thousand future wri∣ters,
that the porcupine darts his quills, and
that these quills, when separated from the ani∣mal,
penetrate deeper, by their own proper ex∣ertion,
into the bodies which they have once en∣tered<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">From this group of credulous travellers, we must except Dr Shaw. “Of the many porcupines which I have seen in Africa, I never knew any of them, though very much pro∣voked, that could dart their quills. Their usual method of defence is, to recline themselves on one side, and, upon the enemy's near approach, to rise up quickly, and gore him with the erected prickles upon the other;” <HI>Shaw's travels, p.</HI> 176. P. Vincent-Marie by no means asserts that the porcupine darts his quills: He only says, that this animal, when he meets with serpents, against whom he carries on a perpetual war, rolls himself up like a ball, concealing his head and feet, and then rolls upon, and kills them with his bristles, without running any risk of being wounded. He adds, what we be∣lieve to be true, that, in the stomach of the porcupine, dif∣ferent kinds of bezoar are formed. Some of these are only a mass of roots enveloped with a crust; others, which are smal∣ler, seem to be composed of pieces of straw and sand; and the smallest kind, which exceed not the size of a nut, appear to be real petrifactions. We have no doubt as to the truth of these facts; for we found a bezoar of the first kind, or an aegagropilus, in the stomach of a porcupine which was sent to us from Italy.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="86"/>
The porcupine, though originally a native of
the warmest climates of Africa and India, can
exist and multiply in colder countries, such as
Persia, Spain, and Italy. Agricola remarks,
that the porcupine was not transported into Eu∣rope
long before his time. It is found in Spain,
and more commonly in Italy, particularly in
the Appennine mountains in the environs of
Rome. It was from this last place that M. Mau∣duit,
who, stimulated by his love of natural hi∣story,
sent us the porcupine which M. Dauben∣ton
has described. We have given the figure
of this Italian porcupine, as well as that of In∣dia.
The slight differences between them de∣pend
on the climate, or perhaps they are only
individual varieties.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="87"/>
Aristotle, Pliny, and all the naturalists, tell us,
that the porcupine, like the bear, conceals itself
during the winter, and brings forth in thirty
days. These facts we have not been able to a∣scertain;
and it is singular, that, in Italy, where
the animal is common, and where, at all periods,
there have been learned philosophers and acute
observers, no man has ever written its history.
On this subject, as well as on many others, Al∣drovandus
has only copied Gesner; and the Gen∣tlemen
of the Academy, who have described and
dissected eight porcupines, say little or nothing
concerning their oeconomy and manners. We
only learn from the testimony of travellers, and
of those who keep the porcupine in menageries,
that, in a domestic state, it is neither wild nor
ferocious, but only anxious for liberty; and
that, by the assistance of fore teeth, which are
strong and sharp, like those of the beaver, it cuts
wood, and pierces the door of its cage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are porcupines in Guiney. They grow to the height of two or two and a half feet, and their teeth are so sharp and strong that no wood can resist them. I put one in∣to a barrel, imagining that it was sufficiently secured: But, in one night, it gnawed through the wood, and made its e∣scape; <HI>Voyage de Bosman, p.</HI> 253.</NOTE>. We
likewise know, that it is easily fed upon crumbs
of bread, cheese, and fruits; that, in a state of
liberty, it lives upon roots and wild seeds; that,
when it gets admission to a garden, it makes
great havock, and devours all kinds of pot-herbs
with avidity; that, like most other animals, it
<PB N="75" REF="88"/>
becomes fat about the end of summer; and that
its flesh, though somewhat insipid, is not bad to
eat.</P>
<P>By examining the form, substance, and orga∣nization
of the prickles, we easily perceive that
they are tubes, and only want vanes to be real
feathers. From this circumstance, the porcupine
constitutes the shade between quadrupeds and
birds. The quills, particularly those near the
tail, make a noise by striking each other when
the animal walks. He can elevate or depress
his quills, as the peacock raises or lowers the
feathers of his tail. Hence the muscular part
of the skin is capable of acting with force, and
its structure is nearly the same as that of some
birds. We have marked these relations, though
not very apparent. It is always fixing one
point in Nature, who often escapes our research∣es,
and seems, in her productions, to sport with
those who wish to cultivate her acquaintance.</P>

<HEAD>The COENDOU, or BRASI∣LIAN
PORCUPINE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Brasilian Porcupine has a short blunt nose, and long white whiskers. Beneath the nose is a bed of small spines. The top of the head, back, sides, and base of the tail, are covered with spines. The longest on the lower part of the back and tail are three inches in length, very sharp, white, and barred near their points with black. They adhere close∣ly to the skin, which is quite naked between them. They are shorter and weaker as they approach the belly; and, on the breast, belly, and lower part of the legs, they are convert∣ed into dark brown bristles. The feet are divided into four toes, and the claws are very long. On the place of the thumb, there is a great protuberance.

animals has been solely composed by men who
are prejudiced with methodical arrangements,
and who mistake their trifling systems for the
genuine registers of Nature. No animals be∣longing
to the warm climates of the Old Conti∣nent
exist in America; neither are any of the
South American animals to be found under the
Torrid Zone of Africa and Asia. The porcu∣pine,
as formerly remarked, is an original inha∣bitant
of the warm countries of the Old World;
and, having never been found in the New, his
name has been transferred to such animals as re∣sembled
him, and particularly that now under
consideration. On the other hand, the coendu
of America has been transported to the East In∣dies;
and Piso, who probably knew not the Por∣cupine,
made Bontius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jac. Bontii, Hist. Indiae Orient. p. 54.</NOTE>, who treats only of ani∣mals
belonging to the south of Asia, engrave the
American coendou under the name of the true
porcupine; so that, at first sight, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would be
tempted to think that this animal existed equally
in America and in Asia. With a little attention,
however, it is easy to perceive, that Piso, who,
in this article, as well as in most parts of his
work, is but the plagiary of Marcgrave, has not
<PB N="78" REF="93"/>
only copied Marcgrave's figure of the coendou
into his history of Brasil, but likewise engraved
it again for Bontius's work, which he digested
and published. Hence, though we have the fi∣gure
of the coendou in Bontius, we must not
conclude that it exists in Java, or in any other
part of the East Indies, nor take this figure for
that of the Porcupine, between which and the
coendou there is no similarity, except that both
have quills or spines.</P>
<P>It is to Ximenes, and afterwards to Hernan∣dez,
that we owe our first knowledge of this ani∣mal,
which they have pointed out under the
Mexican name of <HI>Hoitztlacuatzin:</HI> The <HI>tlacu∣atzin</HI>
is the opossum; and <HI>hoitztlacuatzin</HI> should
be translated the <HI>bristly</HI> or <HI>spinous opossum.</HI> This
denomination has been ill applied; for these ani∣mals
have very little resemblance. Marcgrave
has not adopted this Mexican name, but calls
the animal by its Brasilian name, <HI>cuandu.</HI> Marc∣grave,
however, ought to have perceived, that
his Brasilian cuandu was the same animal with
the hoitztlacuatzin of Mexico, especially as his
figure and description correspond very well with
those of Hernandez, and as Laët, the editor and
commentator of Marcgrave, says, in express
terms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Videtur esse idem animal aut saltem simile quod Fr. Ximenès describit sub nomine Tlaquatzin spinosi. <HI>De Laët, annotatio in cap. 9. lib. 6. Marcgrave, pag.</HI> 233.</NOTE>, that the spinous tlacuatzin of Ximenes,
<PB N="79" REF="94"/>
and the cuanda, are probably the same animal.
From the few notices to be collected from tra∣vellers,
it appears that there are two varieties
of these animals, which the naturalists have co∣pied
from Piso<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cuandu major; <HI>Pison. hist. Bras. pag. 324. fig. pag.</HI> 325. Cuandu seu cuandu min<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r; <HI>Pison. Id. pag. 99. fig. ibid.</HI></NOTE> into their catalogues, as two
distinct species, namely, the great and the small
cuandu<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Hystrix longius caudatus, brevioribus aculeis; <HI>Barrére, Hist. Nat. de la Fr. equinox. Porc epic, pag.</HI> 153.... Hystrix minor; <HI>Leucopheus, Gouandou; id ibid.</HI></P>

Hystrix novae Hispaniae. <HI>Le porc-epic de la nouvelle Espagne. Id. pag.</HI> 127.</P></NOTE>. But the error, or the negligence of
Piso, is apparent; for, though he gives these
coendous in two separate articles, and seems to
regard them as distinct species, he represents
both by the same figure: Hence we are entitled
to pronounce them to be the same animal. There
are also some naturalists who not only make
two species of the great and small coendou, but
have separated them from the hoitztlacuatzin,
and given the whole three as different animals;
I acknowledge, indeed, that, though the coen∣dou
and hoitztlacuatzin are probably the same
animal, their identity is not so certain as that of
the great and small coendou.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="95"/>
However this matter stands, the coendou is
not the porcupine. The former is much smaller.
His head and muzzle are proportionally shorter.
He has no plume or crest on his head, and his
upper-lip is not divided. He has a long tail;
but that of the porcupine is very short. He is
rather a carnivorous than a frugivorous animal;
for he endeavours to surprise birds, small qua∣drupeds,
and poultry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This fact, which is asserted by Marcgrave and Piso, is not certain; for Hernandez, on the contrary, says, that the hoitztlacuatzin feeds upon fruits.</NOTE>, while the porcupine lives
upon pot-herbs, roots, and fruit. Like the
hedge-hog, he sleeps during the day, and moves
about in the night. He climbs trees<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Scandit arbores sed tardo gressu, quia pollice caret; de∣scendens autem caudam circumvolvit ne labatur, admodum enim metuit lapsum, nec salire potest; <HI>Marcgrav. Hist. nat.

himself by the tail upon the branches.
He may be tamed. He commonly lives in e∣levated
places<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Carnem habet bonam et pergratam; nam assatam saepe comedi, et ab incolis valde aestimatur; <HI>Marcgrav. p.</HI> 233.—His flesh is very good, and it is scalded, like that of the hog. But the savage women previously pull off all the quills from his back, of which they make various trinkets.—After being scalded, washed, and roasted on a spit, it is of equal value with a pig; <HI>Descript. de l'Amerique par Denis, tom. 2. p.</HI> 324.</NOTE>; and he is found through the
whole continent of America, from Brasil and
Guiana, as far as Louisiana, and the southern
<PB N="81" REF="96"/>
parts of Canada. But the porcupine is confined
to the warm regions of the Old Continent.</P>
<P>By conferring the name of porcupine upon
the coendou, the same powers have also been a∣scribed
to him, particularly that of shooting his
quills. It is astonishing, that naturalists and
voyagers should agree in this fact, and that Pi∣so,
who ought to have been less superstitious,
because he was a physician, should gravely tell
us, that the quills of the coendou pierce the flesh
by their own proper force, and penetrate into
the bowels of an animal. Though these facts
be evidently absurd, Ray is the first author who
denied them. But how many absurdities have
been exposed by men of sense, which are still
daily affirmed by other men who believe they
possess a greater portion of it?</P>

<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>In Guiana there are two species of Coendous.
The largest weighs from twelve to fifteen pounds.
They keep always on the highest trees. They
eat none during the day. Their odour is very
strong, and is felt at a great distance. The fe∣males
bring forth their young, to the number of
two, in the holes of trees. They feed on the
leaves of these trees, and are not very common.
<PB N="82" REF="97"/>
Their flesh is extremely good; and the negroes
prefer it to that of the paca. According to M.
de la Borde, the two species never mix. They
are never found in pairs, except in the season of
love. At other times, they are solitary; and
the females never quit the tree in which they
have brought forth. These animals are apt to
bite; but their bite is not sore or dangerous.</P>
<P>The individuals of the small species weigh a∣bout
six pounds. They are not more numerous
than the others. The tigers are deadly foes to
the coendous; and they never appear on the
ground during the day.</P>

<P>THIS animal has never received a proper
name. Placed by Nature in the desert
regions of North America, it enjoys an inde∣pendent
existence, remote from man, from
whom it has obtained no denomination, which
is the first badge of his empire. Hudson ha∣ving
discovered the land which it inhabits, we
shall give it a name which recalls that of its first
<PB N="84" REF="100"/>
master, and indicates, at the same time, its poig∣nant
and bristly nature. Besides, it was neces∣sary
to bestow a name upon it, to prevent its
being confounded with the porcupine, or the
coendou, which it resembles in some characters,
but differs so widely from them in all others,
that it ought to be regarded as a particular spe∣cies.
It likewise belongs to a northern climate,
while the other two are natives of the south.</P>
<P>Edwards, Ellis, and Catesby, have all men∣tioned
this animal. The figures given by the
two first authors correspond with ours; and we
doubt not but they are the same species. We
are even tempted to believe, that the animal de∣scribed
and engraven by Seba<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Porcus aculeatus sylvestris, sive Hystrix orientalis singula∣ris; <HI>Seba, vol. 1. p. 84 tab. 52. fig.</HI> 1.</NOTE>, under the name

by the characters given by Seba, might be the
same with the animal under question. This
would not, as formerly remarked, be the only
time that Seba has exhibited American animals
as belonging to the East Indies. We cannot,

however, be so certain with regard to this ani∣mal
as we have been with several others. We
shall only say, that the resemblances appear to
be very great, and the differences but slight; and
that, as these animals are little known, the dif∣ferences
may be only individual varieties, or
those which distinguish males and females.</P>
<P>The Canada porcupine might be called the
<HI>bristly beaver.</HI> It is a native of the same coun∣try,
is of the same size, and has nearly the
same figure. Like the beaver, it has two long,
sharp, and strong cutting teeth in each jaw. In∣dependent
of its quills, which are short, and al∣most
concealed among the hair, it has, like the
beaver, a double fur, the first consisting of long
soft hairs, and the second of a down still more
soft. When the animal is young, the quills are
proportionally larger, and more apparent, and
the hairs are shorter and thinner than in the a∣dults.</P>
<P>This animal avoids all kinds of moisture. He
retires and deposits his excrements under the
roots of hollow trees<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Edwards, hist. of Birds, p. 52.</NOTE>. He sleeps much, and
feeds chiefly on the bark of the juniper bushes.
In winter, the snow serves him for drink; and,
in summer, he drinks water, which he laps like
a dog. The savages eat his flesh, and clothe
themselves with his fur, after depriving it of the
quills and bristles.</P>

<P>THE <HI>Tanrecs</HI> or <HI>Tendracs</HI> are small East In∣dian
animals which have some resemblance
to our hedgehog, but differ so much from it as
to constitute a distinct species. This is apparent,
<PB N="87" REF="104"/>
independent of inspection or comparison; for
they never roll themselves up into a ball, like
the hedgehog; and besides, the tanrecs are found
in Madagascar, where there are also hedgehogs
of the same kind with ours, which bear not the
name of <HI>tanrec,</HI> but are called <HI>Sora</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage a Madagascar, par Flacourt, p. 152.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There seems to be two species, or perhaps two
races of tanrecs: The first, which is nearly as
large as our hedgehog, has a muzzle propor∣tionally
longer than the second; its ears are al∣so
more apparent, and it has fewer bristles
than the other, to which we have given the
name of <HI>Tendrac,</HI> to distinguish it from the first.
This tendrac is not larger than a great rat. Its
muzzle and ears are shorter than those of the
tanrec, which last is covered with smaller bristles,
but equally numerous with those of the hedge∣hog.
The tendrac, on the contrary, has no
spines but on the head, the neck, and the withers,
the rest of the body being covered with coarse
hair, like hogs bristles.</P>
<P>These small animals, which have short legs,
move very slowly. They grunt and wallow
in the mire like hogs<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Recueil des voyages qui ont servir à l'etablissement de la Compagnie des Indes de Hollande, tom. 1. p. 412.</NOTE>. They are fond of
water, in which they dwell longer than upon
land. They are caught in salt water, canals,
and in small gulfs of the sea. They are very
<PB N="88" REF="105"/>
ardent in their amours, and multiply greatly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Relation de Fr. Cauche, p. 127.—Voyages de la Com∣pagnie des Indes de Hollande, p. 412.</NOTE>.
They dig holes in the ground, into which they
retire, and lie in a torpid state during several
months. In this state, their hair falls off, which
grows again after they awake. They are gene∣rally
very fat; and, though their flesh be insipid
and reedy, the Indians eat it with pleasure.

<HEAD>SECOND VIEW OF NATURE.</HEAD>
<P>INDIVIDUALS, whatever their kind or num∣ber
may be, are of no value in the universe.
Species are the only existences in Nature; for they
are equally antient and permanent with herself.
To form a distinct idea of this subject, we shall
not consider species as a collection or succession
of similar individuals, but as a whole, indepen∣dent
of number and of time, always active and
always the same; a whole, which has been rec∣koned
one in the works of creation, and, there∣fore,
constitutes only a unit in Nature. Of all
those units, the human species holds the first
rank: The others, from the elephant to the mite,
from the cedar to the hyssop, are in the second
and third orders. Though different in form, in
substance, and even in life, each retains its pro∣per
place, subsists by itself, defends itself against
the others, and the whole together represent
animated Nature, who supports, and will con∣tinue
to support herself in the same manner as
we now behold her. A day, a year, an age, or
any given portion of time, constitutes no part of
her duration. Time itself relates only to indi∣viduals,
to beings whose existence is fugitive.
But the existence of species is constant; their
permanence produces duration, and their diffe∣rences
<PB N="90" REF="109"/>
give rise to number. Let us consider
species in this light; let us give to each an equal
right to the indulgence and support of Nature.
To her they are all equally dear; for, on each
of them, she has bestowed the means of subsist∣ing,
and of lasting as long as herself.</P>
<P>Let us now suppose the species to change pla∣ces
with the individual. We have already seen
what Nature is in relation to man; let us next
consider in what light she would appear to a be∣ing
who represented the whole human species.
In the spring, the verdure of the fields revives,
the buds and flowers expand, the bees recover
from their torpid state, the swallow returns to
our land, the nightingale chants the song of love,
the ram frisks, the bull lows with desire, and all
animated creatures are eager to join and to
multiply their species; we have then no idea
but that of reproduction and the increase of life.
On the other hand, when the dark season of
cold and frost approaches, animated beings
become indifferent, and even avoid each other;
the inhabitants of the air desert our climates,
those of the water lose their freedom under
vaults of ice; most animals grow torpid, and
dig retreats for themselves in the ground; the
earth hardens, the plants wither, and the trees,
deprived of their foliage, bend under loads of
snow and hoar-frost; every object excites the
idea of languor and annihilation. But these i∣deas
of renovation and destruction, or rather
<PB N="91" REF="110"/>
these images of death and life, however great
and general they appear, are only individual and
particular. Man, as an individual, thinks in this
manner: But the being whom we have substitu∣ted
for the species, thinks and judges in a man∣ner
more sublime and general. In this alternate
destruction and renovation, in all these succes∣sive
vicissitudes, he perceives only permanence
and duration. The season of one year is to
him the same as that of the preceding, the same
as that of millions of ages. The thousandth a∣nimal,
in the order of generation, is the same to
him as the first. In fine, if man lived for ever,
if all the beings which surround him existed in
the same manner as they do at present, the idea
of time would vanish, and the individual would
become the species.</P>
<P>Why should we not consider Nature, for a
few moments, under this new aspect? In truth,
man comes into this world enveloped in dark∣ness.
The mind being equally naked with the
body, he is born without knowledge and with∣out
defence. He brings nothing with him
but passive qualities. He is obliged to receive
the impressions of objects on his organs; the
light shines long on his eyes before he can re∣cognise
it. At first, he receives every thing from
Nature, and makes her no returns. But, as soon
as his senses have acquired strength an activity,
as soon as he can compare his sensations, he re∣flects
upon the universe; he forms ideas, and
<PB N="92" REF="111"/>
retains, extends, and combines them. Man, e∣specially
when he has been instructed, is not a
simple individual: He represents, in a great mea∣sure,
the whole human species. He begins with
receiving from his parents the knowledge which
had been transmitted to them from their fathers;
thus, by means of the divine arts of writing and
printing, the present age is, in some measure, i∣dentified
with those that are past. This accu∣mulation,
in one man, of the experience of ma∣ny
centuries, extends the limits of his being to
infinity. He is no more a simple individual,
born, like other animals, with the capacity of
attending to present sensations alone: He is
nearly the being we supposed to represent the
whole species. He reads what is past, sees the
present, and judges of the future; and, in the
torrent of time, which carries off and absorbs all
the individuals of the universe, he perceives that
the species are permanent, and Nature invariable.
The relations of objects being always the same,
to him the order of time appears to be nothing.
In his eyes, the laws of renovation only coun∣terbalance
those of permanence: A continual
succession of similar beings is, in effect, equiva∣lent
only to the perpetual existence of one of
these beings.</P>
<P>What purposes, then, are served by this vast
train of generations, this immense profusion of
germs, many thousands of which are abortive
for one that succeeds? Does not this perpetual
<PB N="93" REF="112"/>
propagation of beings, which are incessantly de∣stroyed
and renewed, uniformly exhibit the same
scene, and occupy neither more nor less of Na∣ture?
From whence proceed those alterations of
life and death, those laws of growth and decay,
all those individual vicissitudes, and all those re∣iterated
representations of one and the same
thing? They are derived from the very essence
of Nature, and depend on the first establishment
of the universal machine; the whole of which
is fixed and stable; but each of its parts being
capable of motion, the general movements of
the celestial bodies have produced the particular
motions of this terrestrial globe. The penetra∣ting
forces by which these immense bodies are a∣nimated,
by which they act reciprocally upon
each other at a distance, animate at the same
time every particle of matter; and this mutual
propensity of all the parts toward each other, is
the first bond of beings, the principle of consi∣stence
and permanency in Nature, and the sup∣port
of harmony in the universe. The great
combinations give rise to the smaller relations:
The motion of the earth on its own axis having
divided the portions of duration into day and
night, all its animated inhabitants have their
times of light and of darkness, of waking and
sleeping. The action of the senses, and the mo∣tions
of the members, which constitute a great
part of the animal oeconomy, are related to this
first combination. Would there be senses alive
<PB N="94" REF="113"/>
to light in a world there perpetual darkness
reigned?</P>
<P>The inclination of the axis of the earth pro∣ducing,
in its annual motion round the sun, con∣siderable
changes of heat and cold, which we
call <HI>seasons,</HI> all vegetables have also, either totally or
partially, their seasons of life and of death. The
fall of the leaves and fruits, the withering of
herbs, and the destruction of insects, depend en∣tirely
on this second combination. In climates
where it does not take place, the life of vegetables
is never suspended, and every insect completes
its peculiar period of existence. Under the line,
where the four seasons make but one, the earth
is always covered with flowers, the trees are in
perpetual verdure, and Nature enjoys a conti∣nual
spring.</P>
<P>The particular constitution of animals and of
plants is relative to the general temperature of
the earth, and this temperature depends on the
situation or distance of the earth from the sun.
If removed to a greater distance, our animals and
plants could neither live nor vegetate. The wa∣ter,
the sap, the blood, all the liquors, would
lose their fluidity: At a smaller distance, they
would vanish and dissipate in vapour. Ice and
fire are the elements of death; temperate heat
is the first germ of life.</P>
<P>The living particles diffused through organized
bodies are related, both by their activity and
number, to the particles of light, which strike
<PB N="95" REF="114"/>
and penetrate all matter with their heat. Where∣ever
the rays of the sun can heat the earth, its
surface is covered with verdure, and peopled
with animals. Even ice itself, as soon as it dis∣solves
into water, seems to be fecundated. This
element is more fertile than that of the earth:
From heat it receives motion and life. The sea
produces, every season, more animals than the
earth sustains: But it produces fewer vegetables.
Hence all the animals which inhabit the ocean,
by not having, like those on the land, a perma∣nent
stock of vegetable substances to support
them, are under the necessity of feeding up∣on
each other; and to this combination their
immense multiplication is to be referred.</P>
<P>Every species having been originally created,
the first individuals served as a model to their
descendants. The body of each animal or ve∣getable
is a mould, to which are assimilated in∣differently
the organic particles of all animals or
vegetables which have been destroyed by death
or consumed by time. The brute particles,
which formed part of their composition, return
to the common mass of inanimated matter. But
the organic particles, whose duration is perma∣nent,
are resumed by organized bodies: They
are first extracted from the earth by vegetables,
then absorbed by animals which feed upon ve∣getables,
and thus serve for the expansion, sup∣port,
and growth of both. By circulating per∣petually
from body to body, they animate all
<PB N="96" REF="115"/>
organized beings. The stock of these living sub∣stances
is always the same. They vary only in
form, or in difference of appearance. In fertile
ages, during the times of the greatest popula∣tion,
the whole surface of the earth seems to be
covered with men, domestic animals, and useful
plants. But, during the period of famine and
depopulation, the ferocious animals, noxious in∣sects,
parasitical plants, and useless herbs, resume,
in their turn, dominion over the earth. These
changes, so sensible to man, are perfectly indif∣ferent
to Nature: The silk-worm, so precious to us,
is to her only the caterpillar of the mulberry tree.
Though this caterpillar, which ministers to our
luxury, should disappear, though the plants
which nourish our domestic animals should be
devoured by other caterpillars, though others
should threaten with destruction the substance
of our corns before the harvest, in fine, though
man and the larger animals should be starved by
the inferior tribes, Nature would not be less full,
nor less alive. She protects not one at the ex∣pence
of another; she equally supports the whole.
But, with regard to individuals, she knows not
number, and views them only as successive ima∣ges
of the same impression, as fugitive shadows,
of which the species is the substance.</P>
<P>There exists, therefore, in the earth, air, and
waters, a determined quantity of organic matter
which nothing can destroy, and, at the same
time, a determined number of moulds capable
<PB N="97" REF="116"/>
of assimilating it; and these moulds are perpe∣tually
annihilated and renewed. This number
of moulds, or individuals, though variable in
every species, is, upon the whole, always the
same, always proportioned to the quantity of
living matter. If this matter were redundant,
if it were not at all times equally occupied, and
entirely absorbed by the moulds which already
exist, it would form others, and produce new
species. Being alive, it never remains without
action; and its union with brute matter is suffi∣cient
to constitute organized bodies. It is to
this great combination, or rather to this inva∣riable
proportion, that Nature owes her form
and consistence.</P>
<P>As the laws of Nature regarding the number,
support, and equilibrium, of the species, are
fixed and permanent, she would uniformly ex∣hibit
the same appearances, and, in all climates
and times, would be absolutely and relatively
the same, if her complexion did not vary almost
infinitely in individual forms. The impression
of each species is a figure, the principal features
of which are engraven in characters which can
never be effaced. But all the accessory shades
and touches are greatly diversified; no indivi∣dual
has a perfect resemblance to another; no
species exists without a number of varieties. In
the human species, which bears the strongest
marks of divinity, the impression varies from
white to black, from small to great, &amp;c. The
<PB N="98" REF="117"/>
Laplander, the Patagonian, the Hottentot, the
European, the American, and the Negro, though
sprung from the same parents, have by no means
the similarity of brothers.</P>
<P>All species, therefore, are subject to individual
differences: But the constant varieties, which are
perpetuated through successive generations, belong
not equally to every species. The more digni∣fied
the species, its figure is the more fixed, and
admits of fewer varieties. The multiplication
of animals being inversely proportional to their
magnitude, and the possibility of differences be∣ing
in the direct proportion to the numbers
they produce, there must necessarily be more
varieties among the small than the large ani∣mals,
and, for the same reason, a greater num∣ber
of species which make a near approach to
each other. In large animals, the unity of the
species is more fixed, and the distance which se∣parates
them is also more extended. How many
varieties and neighbouring species accompany,
follow, or precede the squirrel, the rat, and o∣ther
small quadrupeds, while the majestic, ele∣phant
walks alone, and without a peer, at the
head of the whole?</P>
<P>The brute matter, of which the mass of the
earth is composed, is a virgin or untouched sub∣stance,
that has undergone no alterations. But
the whole has been more than once put in mo∣tion,
and distrubed by the hand of Nature. The
globe of the earth has been penetrated by fire,
<PB N="99" REF="118"/>
and afterwards covered and disordered by water.
The sand which fills the interior parts of the
earth is a vitrified matters. The thick beds of
clay which cover its surface, are only the same
sand decomposed by the operation of the waters.
Granite, free stone, flint, and all the metals, are
nothing but this same vitrified matter, the par∣ticles
of which are united, condensed, or sepa∣rated,
according to the laws of their affinity.
All these substances are perfectly inanimate:
They exist, and will continue to exist, indepen∣dent
of animals and vegetables. But there are
many other substances, which, though they
appear to be equally inanimate, derive their
origin from organized bodies: Marble, lime∣stone,
chalk, and marle, are composed of the
spoils of shells, and of those small animals
which, by transforming the water of the sea in∣to
stone, produce coral, and all the madrepores,
the varieties of which are numberless, and the
quantity almost immense. Pit coal, turf, and
other substances, also found in the superiour stra∣ta
of the earth, are nothing but the residue of
vegetables more or less corrupted and consumed.
In fine, there are other substances, though fewer
in number, such as pumice stones, sulphur, the
scoriae of iron, asbestos, and lava, which have been
thrown out by volcanoes, and produced by a second
action of fire upon the original matters. To these
three great combinations may be referred all the
<PB N="100" REF="119"/>
relations of brute matter, and all the substances
of the mineral kingdom.</P>
<P>The laws of affinity, by which the constituent
particles of these different substances separate
from each other, in order to unite among them∣selves,
and form homogeneous masses, are the
same with that general law by which the celes∣tial
bodies act upon one another. Their exer∣tions
are mutual, and proportioned to their mas∣ses
and distances. Globules of water, of sand,
or of metal, act upon each other in the same
manner as the earth acts upon the moon: And,
if these laws of affinity have hitherto been re∣garded
as different from those of gravity, it must
be ascribed to the confined views we have taken
of the subject. Figure, which, in the celestial
bodies, has almost no effect upon their mutual
action, because the distance is too great, has great
influence when the distance is very small. If
the earth and moon, instead of a spherical figure,
were both short cylinders, and equal throughout
in their diameters, their reciprocal action would
not be sensibly altered by this difference of fi∣gure,
because the distance of all the parts of the
moon from those of the earth would be very
little changed. But, if these same globes were
cylinders of great extent, and placed near each
other, the law of their reciprocal action would
appear to be very different; because the relative
distances of their parts would be greatly varied.
Hence, whenever figure becomes a principle in
<PB N="101" REF="120"/>
distance, the law seems to vary, though, in fact,
it remains always the same.</P>
<P>From this principle, the human intellect may
advance one step farther, and penetrate deeper
into the operations of Nature. We are ignorant
of the figure of the constituent particles of bo∣dies.
Water, air, earth, metals, and all homo∣geneous
substances, are unquestionably composed
of elementary particles, which are similar among
themselves, but whose figure is unknown. Po∣sterity,
by the aid of calculation, may disclose
this new field of knowledge, and ascertain, with
considerable precision, the figure of the elements
of bodies. They will take the principle we have
established as the basis of their reasoning: <HI>All
matter is attracted in the inverse ratio of the
square of the distance; and this law seems to ad∣mit
of no variation in particular attractions, but
what arises from the figure of the constituent par∣ticles
of each substance; because this figure enters,
as an element or principle into the distance.</HI> Hence,
when they discover, be reiterated experiments,
the law of attraction in any particular substance,
they may find, by calculation, the figure of its
constituent particles. To make this matter
more clear, let us suppose, that, by placing mer∣cury
on a perfectly polished surface, we find,
by experiment, that this fluid metal is always
attracted in the inverse ratio of the cube of the
distance, we must investigate, by the rules of
false position, what figure gives this expression;
<PB N="102" REF="121"/>
and this figure will be that of the constituent
particles of mercury. If, from these experi∣ments,
it appeared that the attraction of mercu∣ry
was in the inverse ratio of the square of the
distance, it would be demonstrated that its con∣stituent
particles are spherical; because a sphere
is the only figure which observes this law, and,
at whatever distance globes are placed, the law
of their attraction is always the same.</P>
<P>Newton conjectured, that chemical affinities,
which are nothing but the particular attractions
we have mentioned, were produced by laws si∣milar
to those of gravitation. But he seems not
to have perceived, that all these particular laws
were only simple modifications of the general
law, and that they appeared to be different, on∣ly
because, at very small distances, the figure of
atoms which attract each other has a greater
influence upon the expression of this law, than
the mass of matter.</P>
<P>Upon this theory, however, the intimate
knowledge of the composition of brute matter
solely depends. The basis of all matter is the
same; and the form of it would likewise be the
same, if the figure of its constituent particles
were perfectly similar. One homogeneous sub∣stance
cannot differ from another, but in pro∣portion
to the difference of the figures of their
primitive particles. A body, of which all the
particles are spherical, ought to be one half spe∣cifically
lighter than another whose particles
<PB N="103" REF="122"/>
are cubical; because the first, by touching each
other only in points, leave intervals equal to the
spaces they occupy, while the cubical particles
unite without leaving the smallest void, and,
consequently, form a matter one half heavier
than the first. Though figures may be infinitely
varied, they seem not to be so numerous in Na∣ture
as might be imagined; for she has fixed
the limits of gravity and levity. Gold and air
are the two extremes of density. All the figures
admitted by Nature, therefore, are comprehend∣ed
between these two terms; and all those
which would have produced heavier or lighter
substances have been rejected.</P>
<P>When I speak of figures employed by Nature,
I mean not that they are necessarily, or even
exactly, similar to those geometrical figures
which exist in our imagination. We make laws
by supposition, and we render them simple by
abstraction. There are, perhaps, neither exact
cubes, nor perfect spheres in the universe. But,
as nothing exists without form, and as, accor∣ding
to the diversity of substances, the figures of
the elements are different, some of them must
necessarily approach to the sphere, the cube, and
all the other regular figures which we have con∣ceived.
The precise, the absolute, the abstract,
which so often present themselves to our minds,
can have no real existence, because all objects
are related, differ only by almost imperceptible
shades, and are allied by approximation. In
<PB N="104" REF="123"/>
the same manner, when I mention one substance
as being entirely full, because it is composed of
cubical particles, and another as being only half
full, because its constituent particles are spherical,
I speak only comparatively, and mean not that
such substances really exist; for we know from
experience, that, in transparent bodies, such as
glass, which is both dense and heavy, the quan∣tity
of matter is very small in proportion to the
extent of the intervals; and it might be de∣monstrated,
that gold, which is the densest spe∣cies
of matter, contains more vacuities than
substance.</P>
<P>The consideration of the powers of Nature is the
object of rational mechanics; that of sensible mecha∣nics
is only a combination of particular powers,
and is reduced to the art of constructing machines.
Necessity and convenience have at all times in∣sured
the culture of this art. The antients excel∣led
in it as well as the moderns. But rational
mechanics is a science invented in our days. All
philosophers, from Aristotle to Descartes, have
reasoned like the vulgar upon the nature of mo∣tion.
They have uniformly mistaken the ef∣fect
for the cause. They knew no force but
that of impulsion, to which they attributed the
effects of other forces, and referred to it all the
phaenomena of the universe. If the notion
had been plausible, or even possible, this impul∣sion,
which they regarded as the sole cause, must
at least have been a general effect, which equal∣ly
<PB N="105" REF="124"/>
belonged to all matter, and which continual∣ly
exerted itself in all places, and at all times.
The opposite was daily demonstrated to them.
Did they not perceive, that, in bodies at rest,
this force had no existence; that, in projected
bodies, it subsisted but a sort time, and was
soon destroyed by resistence; that, to renew it,
a fresh impulse was necessary; and that, conse∣quently,
so far from being a general cause, it
was only a particular effect, produced by more
general effects?</P>
<P>Now, a general effect is what ought to be
called a cause; for the real cause of this effect
can never be known to us; because all our
knowledge is derived from comparison; and an
effect being supposed general, and belonging e∣qually
to all matter, we can compare it to no∣thing,
and, of course, can know it only by the
fact. Hence attraction, or gravity, being a ge∣neral
effect common to all matter, and demon∣strated
by the fact, it ought to be regarded as a
cause, and to it should be referred all other
particular causes, and even that of impulsion,
since it is less general and less constant. The
difficulty is to perceive how impulsion can be
an effect of attraction. If we reflect on the
communication of motion by impulse, we will
be persuaded that it can only be transmitted from
one body to another by elasticity, and that all
the hypotheses concerning the communication
of motion in hard bodies, are mere fancies,
<PB N="106" REF="125"/>
which have no existence in Nature. A body
perfectly hard or perfectly elastic, is a creature
of imagination. Neither the one nor the other
really exist; because nothing exists absolutely
or in extreme, and the idea of perfection is
only the absolute or extreme of a thing.</P>
<P>If there was no elasticity in matter, there
could be no impulsive force. When we throw
a stone, the motion which it acquires is commu∣nicated
to it by the elasticity of the arm. When
a body in motion meets another at rest, how can
we conceive that the one should communicate
motion to the other in any other manner than by
compressing the spring of the elastic particles it
contains, which, by recovering itself immedi∣ately
after compression, gives to the whole mass
the same force that it received. We cannot com∣prehend
how a perfectly hard body should admit
this force, or receive motion. Besides, the in∣quiry
is useless, as no such body exists. All bo∣dies,
on the contrary, are endowed with elasti∣city.
Experiments on electricity prove that
its force is elastic, and belongs to matter in ge∣neral.
Though, therefore, no other elasticity
existed in the interior parts of bodies but that
of this electrical matter, it would be sufficient
for the communication of motion; and, conse∣quently,
to this great spring, as a general effect,
the particular cause of impulsion must be a∣scribed.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="126"/>
Now, if we reflect upon the mechanism of
elasticity, we shall find, that its force depends
on that of attraction. To obtain a clearer per∣ception
of this subject, let us suppose the most
simple spring, a solid angle of iron; or of any o∣ther
hard substance: What will be the result of
compressing it? We oblige the parts adjacent to
the top of the angle to bend, or to separate a
little from each other; and, the moment the pres∣sure
is removed, they approach each other as
formerly. Their adhesion, from which the co∣hesion
of bodies results, is well known to be an
effect of their mutual attraction. When the spring
is pressed, this adhesion is not destroyed; be∣cause,
though the particles are separated, they are
not so far removed from each other as to put them
beyond their sphere of mutual attraction. Of
course, as soon as the pressure ceases, this force
is again exerted, the separated parts approach,
and their spring is restored. If, on the other
hand, by a pressure too violent, they are removed
beyond the sphere of their attraction, the spring
breaks; because the compressing force has been
greater than that of cohesion, or than that of the
mutual attraction, which keeps the particles to∣gether.
Hence elasticity can exert itself only in
proportion to the cohesion of the particles of
matter, that is, in proportion as they are united
by the force of their mutual attraction; and,
consequently, elasticity in general, which alone
can produce impulsion, and the impulsion itself,
<PB N="108" REF="127"/>
are owing to the force of attraction, and de∣pend
on it as particular effects on a general
effect.</P>
<P>However clear these ideas appear to me, I ex∣pect
not to see them adopted. The people ne∣ver
reason but from their sensations; and natural
philosophers judge from their prejudices. All
these must, therefore, be set aside, and very
few will remain to form a proper judgment.
But this is the fate of Truth; she is content
with a few admirers, and is always lost in a
crowd: Though at all times august and ma∣jestic,
she is often obscured by fantastic notions,
or totally effaced by brilliant chimeras. This,
however, is the manner in which I view and
understand Nature; and perhaps she is still more
simple: A single force is the cause of the phae∣nomena
exhibited by brute matter; and this
force, when combined with that of heat, pro∣duces
those living particles on which all the ef∣fects
of organized bodies depend.</P>

camel. Its head and ears are small, its feet large,
and its legs long, but unequal, those before be∣ing
much taller than those behind, which are
very short, and seem to bring the rump of the
animal down to the ground. Upon the head,
near the ears, there are two eminences like two
small straight horns. Its mouth resembles that
of the stag; the teeth are small and white, the
eyes brilliant, the tail short, and garnished with
black hairs at the point. By adding to this de∣scription
of Oppian those of Heliodorus and
Strabo, we shall have a pretty just idea of the
camelopard. The Aethopian ambassadors, says
Heliodorus, brought an animal of the size of a
camel, whose skin was marked with lively spots
and brilliant colours, and whose posterior parts
were much lower than the anterior. The neck,
though attached to a pretty large body, was thin.
The head, in figure, resembled that of the ca∣mel,
and, in size, it was not twice as large as
that of the ostritch. The eyes appear to be
tinged with different colours. The gait of this
animal was different from that of all other qua∣drupeds,
who in walking lift their feet diago∣nally,
that is, the right fore foot with the left
hind foot. But the camelopard ambles natural∣ly,
lifting the two right or the two left feet to∣gether.
It is a gentle creature, and may be con∣ducted
<PB N="112" REF="131"/>
at pleasure by a small cord put round its
head<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heliodorus, lib. 10.</NOTE>. There is, says Strabo, a large animal
in Aethiopia, called <HI>camelopardalis,</HI> though it has
no resemblance to the panther; for its skin is
not spotted in the same manner. The spots of
the panther are circular, and those of the came∣lopard
resemble the spots of the fawn or young
stag. The posterior parts of its body are much
lower than the anterior; so that, at the rump, it
is not higher than an ox, and at the shoulders
it is higher than a camel. From this dis∣proportion
of parts, its motions should not be
quick. It is a mild animal, does no mischief,
and feeds upon herbs and leaves<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Strabo, lib. 16. et 17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Belon is the first author who has given a good
description of the camelopard. “I saw,” says he,
“at the castle of Cairo, an animal commonly
called <HI>Zurnapa.</HI> It was formerly denominated
<HI>Camelopardalis,</HI> a name compounded of <HI>leopard</HI>
and <HI>camel;</HI> for it is variegated with the spots of
a leopard, and has a long neck, like the camel.
It is a most beautiful creature, as gentle in its
dispositions as a sheep, and more amiable than
any other wild beast. Its head is nearly simi∣lar
to that of the stag, except in size. Its horns
are blunt, six inches long, and covered with
hair; those of the male are longer than those
of the female. Both male and female have
large ears, like those of a cow, and a black
<PB N="113" REF="132"/>
tongue resembling that of an ox. It has no
teeth in the upper jaw. The neck is long,
straight, and slender. The horns are round
and delicate, the legs long and slender, and
those behind are so low, that the animal seems
to stand on end. Its feet resemble those of an
ox. Its tail, which hangs as low as the hock,
is round, having hairs three times as gross as
those of a horse. The hair on the body is
white and red. Its manner of running is si∣milar
to that of the camel. When it runs, the
two fore feet move together. It lies on its
belly, and has hard protuberances on its breast
and thighs, like the camel. When standing, it
cannot browse the grass, without spreading its
fore feet very wide, and even then the opera∣tion
is performed with great difficulty; for
which reason it could not live in the fields, if
it were not supplied with the leaves and sprigs
of trees<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Observ. de Belon, p. 118.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>The description of Gillius is still better than
that of Belon. “I saw, (says Gillius, chap. 9.)
three giraffes at Cairo. They had two horns
of six inches in length, and, on the middle of
the front, a protuberance about two inches
high, which resembled a third horn. This a∣nimal,
when he raises his head, is sixteen feet
high; the neck alone is seven feet; and the
length, from the extremity of the tail to the end
of the nose, is twenty-two feet. The fore and
<PB N="114" REF="133"/>
hind legs are nearly of an equal height. But
the fore thighs are so disproportionally long,
that the back of the animal inclines like the
roof of a house. The whole body is marked
with large yellow spots, nearly of a square fi∣gure
..... It has cloven feet like the ox. The
upper lip protrudes beyond the under. The
tail is slender, with hairs at the point. It ru∣minates
and eats herbage, like the ox. Its mane
extends from the top of the head along the
back. When it walks, its legs and flanks on
both sides seem to be alternately lame; and,
when it browses herbage or drinks, it is obli∣ged
to spread its fore legs prodigiously wide.”</P>
<P>Gesner quotes Belon for affirming that the
horns of the giraffe fall off like those of the fal∣low
deer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Giraffis et damis cornua cadunt; <HI>Belon, Gesner. hist. quad. p.</HI> 148.</NOTE>. I could never discover this fact in
Belon. He only says, in the above passage, that
the horns of the giraffe are covered with hair.
He makes no other mention of this animal, ex∣cept
when treating of the axis, where he remarks,
“that the ground colour of the giraffe is white,
and that the large spots scattered over the body
are reddish, but not so red as those of the ax∣is
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Observ. de Belon, p. 120.</NOTE>.” This fact, however, which I can no
where discover, would be of great importance in
determining the nature of the giraffe; for, if its
horns shed annually, it belongs to the deer kind;
and, on the other hand, if its horns are perma∣nent,
<PB N="115" REF="134"/>
it must be referred to the ox or goat kind.
Until we obtain a distinct knowledge of this fact,
we cannot affirm, as our nomenclators have done,
that the giraffe belongs to the genus of stags;
and it is astonishing that Hasselquist, who has
lately given a very long, and very inanimated
description of this animal, has said nothing con∣cerning
its nature. After amassing methodical∣ly,
that is, like a school-boy, a hundred minute
and insignificant characters, he says not a syllable
regarding the substance of the horns, and leaves
us ignorant whether they are solid or hollow,
whether they shed or not, whether, in a word,
they are <HI>wood</HI> or horns. I here give Hassel∣quist's

but of its singularity, and, at the same time,
to persuade travellers to use their own eyes, and
not to view objects through the medium of other
men's: It is necessary to caution them against
such methodical arrangements, the authors of
which lay reason aside, and believe themselves
wise in proportion to their want of genius. Have
we advanced a single step, after fatiguing our∣selves
with this enumeration of minute, equivo∣cal,
and useless characters? Do not the descrip∣tions
given by the antients and moderns, in the
passages above quoted, convey a more distinct
picture, and clearer ideas of this animal? Fi∣gures
supply all such trifling characters; it is the
province of history to mark those which are
more important: A single glance of the eye up∣on
a good figure conveys more information than
<PB N="117" REF="136"/>
descriptions of this kind, which always become
more obscure in proportion to their minuteness.</P>
<P>In the year 1764, a drawing of the giraffe,
accompanied with some remarks, was sent to the
academy of sciences, from which we learn, that
this animal, which was thought to be peculiar
to Aethiopia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The giraffe is no where found but in Aethiopia. I saw two tame ones in the royal palace. I remarked, that, when they wanted to drink, they were obliged to spread the fore∣legs very wide, otherwise, though their necks were long, they could not reach the water. What I relate, I saw with my eyes; <HI>Relation de Thevenot, p.</HI> 10.</NOTE>, is likewise found in the neigh∣bourhood
of the Cape of Good Hope. The fi∣gure
is so incorrect, that no use can be made of
it; but, as the remarks contain a kind of de∣scription,
they merit insertion: “In an expedi∣tion,
made in the year 1702, two hundred
leagues to the north of the Cape of Good Hope,
we found the camelopardalis, whose figure we
have subjoined. The body resembles that of
an ox, and the head and neck those of a horse.
All those we met with were white with brown
spots. It has two horns, and cloven feet. The
two we killed, and whose skins have been
transmitted to Europe, were of the following
dimensions: The length of the head, one foot
eight inches; the height, from the extremity
of the fore foot to the withers, ten feet, and
from the withers to the top of the head, seven
feet, in all seventeen feet high. The length,
<PB N="118" REF="137"/>
from the withers to the reins is five feet six in∣ches,
and from the reins to the tail, one foot
six inches: Thus, the whole length of the body
is seven feet. The height, from the hind
feet to the reins, is eight feet six inches. From
the disproportion in the height and length, it
appears that this animal can be of little use.
He feeds upon the leaves of trees; and, when
he wants to drink, or to take any thing from
the surface of the earth, he is obliged to bend
down on his knees.”</P>
<P>In examining what travellers have said con∣cerning
the giraffe, I find they all agree, that this
animal, when in its natural situation, can reach
with its head from sixteen to seventeen feet
high<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prosper Alpinus is the only author who gives a different idea of the magnitude of this animal, by comparing it to a small horse: “Anno 1581, Alexandriae vidimus cameloparda∣lem, quem Arabes zurnap et nostri giraffam appellant; haec equum parvum elegantissimumque representare videtur;” <HI>p.</HI> 236. There is every reason to believe, that the giraffe seen by Prosper Alpinus was very young, and had by no means acquired its full growth. The same remark may be made with regard to the skin described by Hasselquist, which he says was of the size of a small camel.</NOTE>; and that its fore-legs are twice as long
as the hind legs; so that, when it sits on its crup∣per,
it seems to be entirely on end<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The fore feet of the giraffe are twice as long as those behind, which, by supporting a long straight slender body, raises the fore part of the animal to a prodigious height. Its head nearly resembles that of a stag, except that its blunt horns exceed not half a foot in length. Its ears are long, like those of a cow, and it has no teeth in the upper jaw. Its hairs are round and fine, its limbs slender, resembling those of a stag, and its feet are like those of a bull. Its body is very slender, and the colour of its hair resembles that of the lynx. In manners and dispositions, it resembles the ca∣mel; <HI>Voyage de Villamont, p.</HI> 688.—I saw, at the castle of Cairo, two giraffes. Their neck was longer than that of the camel, and they had two horns, of half a foot in length, on the top of the head, and a small one on the front. The two fore legs were very long, and the hind ones remarkably short; <HI>Cosmographie du Levant, par Thevet, p.</HI> 142.</NOTE>. They
<PB N="119" REF="138"/>
likewise agree, that, on account of this dispro∣portion,
it cannot run quickly; that its dispo∣sitions
are extremely mild; that, by this quality,
as well as by other physical habits, and even by
the form of the body, it approaches nearer to
the nature of the camel than any other animal;
and that it is one of the ruminating animals,
and, like them, wants the cutting teeth in the
upper jaw. We likewise learn, from the testi∣mony
of some voyagers, that this animal is found
in the southern parts of Africa, as well as in
those of Asia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the island of Zanzibar, in the neighbourhood of Ma∣dagascar, there is a certain quadruped called <HI>graffe</HI> or <HI>giraffe,</HI> which has a neck about a fathom and a half in length, and its fore legs are much longer than those behind. Its head is small, and of different colours, as well as the body.

<P><PB N="120" REF="139"/>
From what we have related, it is evident, that
the giraffe is a peculiar species, and very differ∣ent
from all others. He seems, however, to
make a nearer approach to the camel than to
the stag or the ox. It is true the giraffe has two
horns, and the camel has none: But the other
resemblances are so numerous, that I am not sur∣prised
to see the appellation of <HI>Indian camel</HI> be∣stowed
on him by some travellers. Besides, we
know not the substance of which the horns of
the giraffe are composed; and, consequently, we
know not whether by this part he approaches
nearer to the stag or the ox: They may, per∣haps,
be a substance very different from either.
They may be composed of a congeries of hairs,
like the horns of the rhinoceros; or they may
be a substance of a peculiar texture. Nomen∣clators
seem to have been first led into the blun∣der
of ranking the giraffe with the stags, by the
pretended passage of Belon, quoted by Gesner,
which, if real, would be decisive of the point:
They appear likewise to have misunderstood what
has been mentioned by authors concerning the
hair of these horns. They imagined that these
writers had said, that the horns of the giraffe
were clothed with hair, like the new sprung
horns of the stag; and hence concluded that
they were of the same nature. We see, on the
contrary, from the notes above quoted, that the
horns of the giraffe are only surrounded with
hair, and have a tuft of large coarse hairs at the
<PB N="121" REF="140"/>
point, and not clothed with a down or velvet,
like those of the stag. From this circumstance,
it is not improbable, that the horns of the giraffe
are composed of a congeries of hairs nearly in
the same manner as those of the rhinoceros:
Their blunt or truncated points seem to favour
this idea. Besides, if we consider that, in all a∣nimals
which carry <HI>wood</HI> instead of horns, as
the elk, the rain-deer, the stag, the roebuck, &amp;c.
this <HI>wood</HI> is always divided into branches or
antlers, and that, on the contrary, the horns of
the giraffe are simple, and consist but of one
stem, we will be convinced that they are not of
the same nature, unless analogy, in this instance,
be entirely violated. The tubercle on the front,
which appears to be a third horn, strengthens
this opinion. The two horns, which are not
pointed, but blunt at the extremities, are per∣haps
only tubercles of a greater length than the
former. The females, according to the testi∣mony
of all travellers, have horns as well as the
males, only they are somewhat smaller. If the
giraffe really belonged to the deer-kind, analogy
would again suffer violation; for, among all the
animals of this kind, none of the females, ex∣cept
the female rain-deer, have horns, and we
have given the reason of this phaenomenon. On
the other hand, as the giraffe, on account of the
excessive height of its limbs, cannot feed upon
herbage, but with great difficulty; as its chief
and almost only food consists of the leaves and
<PB N="122" REF="141"/>
buds of trees, it may be presumed, that the sub∣stance
of the horns, which are the most conspi∣cuous
residue of the organic particles derived
from the food, is analogous to wood, like that
of the stag. Time will confirm one or other of
these conjectures. A single word more added
to Hasselquist's minute description would have
determined the genus of this animal. But school-boys,
who have only their master's gamut in their
heads, or rather in their pockets, must perpetu∣ally
blunder, and make the most essential omis∣sions;
because they renounce that spirit of re∣search
which ought to guide every observer, and
see only through the false medium of arbitrary
arrangements, which prevents them from reflec∣ting
on the nature and relations of the objects
they meet with, and obliges them to describe up∣on
a bad model. As every object differs mate∣rially
from another, the whole should be treated
in a different manner. A single character hap∣pily
discovered, is more decisive, and conveys
more knowledge of the subject than a thousand
minute and trifling features; for, in proportion
to their number, they necessarily become equi∣vocal
and common, and, of course superfluous,
if not hurtful to the real knowledge of Nature,
who sports with the rules we prescribe to her,
soars above all methodical distributions, and can
only be perceived by the penetrating eye of ge∣nius.</P>

<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>We here give the figure of the giraffe from a
drawing transmitted to us from the Cape of
Good Hope, which we have rectified in some
points from the information of Mr Bruce. With
regard to the horns of this animal, we are still
uncertain whether they are permanent like those
of the ox, antilope, goat, rhinoceros, &amp;c. or
whether they are annually renewed like those
of the deer-kind. They seem to grow during
the first years of the animal's life; but they ne∣ver
rise to a great height; for the longest which
have been seen exceeded not twelve or thirteen
inches; and they are generally not above six or
eight inches. We are indebted to M. Allamand,
a celebrated Professor at Leyden, for the exact
knowledge we have obtained concerning these
horns. The following is an extract of a letter
he wrote on this subject to M. Daubenton, dated
October 31. 1766.</P>
<P>“I have the honour to inform you, that I
am in possession of a stuffed giraffe. Both
you and M. de Buffon have expressed a desire
to know the nature of its horns. I have cut
off one of them, which I send you, that
you may have a more exact idea of it. You
will remark, that this giraffe was very young.
The Governour of the Cape, from whom I re∣ceived
<PB N="124" REF="143"/>
it, writes me, that it was killed when
lying near its mother. Its height is about six
feet, and its horns, of course, are short, not
exceeding two inches and a half. They are
every where covered with skin and hairs; and
those at the point are much longer than the
others, and form a pencil, the height of which
exceeds that of the horn. The base of the horn
is more than an inch broad, and consequent∣ly
forms an obtuse cone. To discover whether
it was hollow or solid, I sawed it through lon∣gitudinally,
along with a portion of the skull
to which it adhered. I found it to be solid,
and a little spongy, because it had not yet ac∣quired
all its consistence. Such is its texture,
that it appears not to be composed, like that
of the rhinoceros, of hairs united together;
and it resembles the horns of the stag more
than those of any other animal. I would even
say, that there is no difference between these
two substances, if I were certain, that a horn,
lately sent to me under that name, was really
the horn of a giraffe. It is straight, half a
foot long, and pretty much pointed. There
still remain some vestiges of the skin with
which it had been covered; and it differs from
a stag's horn only in figure. If these ob∣servations
are not sufficient, I shall with plea∣sure
send you the two horns, that you may
examine them along with M. de Buffon. With
regard to this animal, I should farther remark,
<PB N="125" REF="144"/>
that the alledged difference between its fore
and hind legs seems to be greatly exaggera∣ted;
for it is hardly perceptible in my young
giraffe.”</P>
<P>Beside these horns which are found on the
head of the female giraffe, as well as on that of
the male, there is, at almost an equal distance
between the nostrils and eyes, a remarkable ex∣crescence,
which seems to be a bone covered
with a soft skin, and garnished with smooth
hair. This osseous excrescence is more than
three inches long, and is much inclined toward
the front, or makes a very acute angle with the
bone of the nose. The colour of this animal's
robe is a bright shining yellow, and the spots
are, in general, rhomboidal.</P>
<P>It is extremely probable, from the inspection
of these horns, which are solid, and resemble in
substance the horns of the stag, that the giraffe
may be ranked in the same genus: Of this there
could not remain a doubt, if we were certain
that he shed his horns annually. But it is now
unquestionable that he ought to be separated
from the ox-kind, and other animals whose
horns are hollow. Meanwhile, we shall consi∣der
this large and beautiful animal as constituting
a particular and solitary genus, which corresponds
very well with the other facts in Nature, who,
in voluminous species, never doubles her pro∣ductions.
The elephant, the rhinoceros, the
hippopotamus, and perhaps the giraffe, are ani∣mals
<PB N="126" REF="145"/>
forming particular genera, or solitary spe∣cies,
who have no collaterals. This is a privi∣lege
which seems to be conferred solely on ani∣mals
which greatly surpass all others in magni∣tude.</P>
<P>In a letter I received from Holland, the sub∣scription
of which was illegible, I had the fol∣lowing
description of a giraffe.</P>
<P>“Africa produces no animal more beautiful
or more curious than the giraffe. From the
point of the nose to the tail, he is twenty-five
feet long. He has received the name of <HI>Ca∣melopard,</HI>
because he somewhat resembles the
camel in the figure of his head, the length of
his neck, &amp;c. and because his robe is variega∣ted
with irregular spots, like that of the leo∣pard.
He is found at twenty-four leagues
from the Cape of Good Hope, and is still
more frequent at greater distances. The teeth
of this animal are similar to those of the stag.
His horns are a foot long: They are straight
as a man's arm, garnished with hair, and seem
to be truncated at their extremities. The neck
constitutes at least one half of the length of
the animal, which, in figure, pretty much re∣sembles
that of a horse. The tail would also
be pretty similar, if it were equally furnished
with hair as that of the horse. The legs are
like those of the stag; the feet are garnished
with very black, obtuse, and widely separated
hoofs. When the animal leaps, he first raises
<PB N="127" REF="146"/>
the two fore feet, and then those behind, as a
horse would do who had his two fore feet
tied together. He runs slowly, and with a
bad grace: He may be easily overtaken in the
chace. He carries his head always high, and
feeds only on the leaves of trees, being unable
to pasture on the ground, on account of his
great height. When he drinks, he is obliged
to rest on his knees. The females are gene∣rally
of a bright yellow colour, and the males
of a brownish yellow. Some of them are
nearly white, with brown or black spots.”</P>
</DIV3>

<HEAD>Supplement from Schneider's Edition.</HEAD>
<P>“M. de Buffon, with much propriety, blames
our modern nomenclators, because, when treat∣ing
of the giraffe, they are silent with regard
to the nature of his horns, which alone can
form a criterion to ascertain the species to
which he belongs; and because they give dry
and minute descriptions, without adding a
figure. We shall endeavour to supply both
these defects.”</P>
<P>“M. Allamand, professor of natural history
in the university of Leyden, is in possession of
the stuffed skin of a young giraffe. He o∣bligingly
communicated to us a drawing of it,
which we caused to be engraven; and he add∣ed
the following description.”</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="147"/>
“M. Tulbagh, Governor of the Cape of Good
Hope, who has enriched our academical ca∣binet
with many rare productions of nature,
writes me, that the young giraffe in our pos∣session
was killed by his hunters at a conside∣rable
distance from the Cape, when lying near
its mother, whom it still sucked. Hence it
appears, that the giraffe is not peculiar to Aethi∣opia,
as Thevenot has alledged.”</P>
<P>“As soon as I received it, I examined the
horns, with a view to elucidate M. de Buffon's
doubt with regard to their substance. They
are not hollow like those of oxen and goats,
but solid, and nearly of an uniform texture,
like those of the stags, from which they differ
only in being thinner, straighter, and not di∣vided
into branches, or antlers. They are
totally covered with the skin of the animal;
and, for three fourths of their length, this skin
is furnished with short hair, similar to that
which covers the body. Toward the points,
the hair becomes longer, rises about three
inches above the blunt end of the horns, and is
of a black colour. Hence it is very different
from the down on the young horns of the
stag.”</P>
<P>“These horns appear not to be composed of
united hairs, like those of the rhinoceros.
Their texture is likewise totally different.
When sawn through longitudinally, we per∣ceive
that they consist of a hard plate, which
<PB N="129" REF="148"/>
constitutes their external surface, and incloses
a spongy substance. This, at least, is the case
with the horns of my young giraffe. Perhaps
the horns of adults are more solid. M. de
Buffon is now in a condition to determine this
point; for, along with the horns of my giraffe,
I sent him another belonging to one more ad∣vanced
in years, which a friend of mine re∣ceived
from the East Indies.”</P>
<P>“Though these horns are solid, like those of
the stag, I suspect that the animal does not
shed them annually. They seem to be an ex∣crescence
of the frontal bone, like the bone
which serves as a nucleus to the hollow horns
of oxen and goats; and, consequently, it is
impossible that they can fall off. If this con∣jecture
be well founded, the giraffe constitutes
a particular genus, perfectly distinct from the
animals who shed their horns, and also from
those who have hollow, but permanent horns.”</P>
<P>“In the middle of the front of adult giraffes,
there is a protuberance which seems to be the
rudiments of a third horn. No such protu∣berance
appeared in our giraffe; probably be∣cause
it was too young.”</P>
<P>“All the authors, both antient and modern,
who describe this animal, tell us, that the fore
legs are twice as long as the hind ones. They
could not possibly be deceived concerning a
character so striking. But I can affirm, that,
in this article, the giraffe must change greatly
<PB N="130" REF="149"/>
in growing; for, in our young one, the hind
legs were equally long with those before.
This circumstance, however, prevents not the
anterior part of the giraffe from being higher
than the posterior, which is owing to the dif∣ference
in the thickness of the body, as may
be seen in the figure. But this difference is
by no means so great as has been represented.”</P>
<P>“The neck of the giraffe is the first thing
which strikes a spectator. It is longer than
that of any other quadruped, not excepting
the camel, who, besides, folds his neck in dif∣ferent
ways, which the giraffe seems to be in∣capable
of performing.”</P>
<P>“His colour is a dirty white, interspersed
with yellowish spots, very near each other on
the neck, more distant on the rest of the body,
and of a figure which approaches to a paral∣lelogram
or rhomb.”</P>
<P>“The tail is slender, in proportion to the
length and stature of the animal. Its extre∣mity
is garnished with a tuft of black hairs,
which are seven or eight inches long.”</P>
<P>“The mane is composed of reddish hair,
three inches long, and inclined toward the
hind part of the body. It extends from the
head along the neck, and down to the middle
of the back; and, at the distance of some
inches, it is again continued; but the hair in∣clines
toward the head. It seems to recom∣mence
near the origin, and to extend to the
<PB N="131" REF="150"/>
extremity of the tail: But the hairs are short,
and scarcely to be distinguished from those
which cover the rest of the body.”</P>
<P>“The eye-lids, both superior and inferior,
are garnished with a range of very stiff hairs.
There are similar hairs, but thinly scattered,
round the mouth.”</P>
<P>“The aspect of the giraffe indicates a mild
and docile animal; and this is the character
given of him by those who have seen him
alive.”</P>
<P>“This description of the giraffe, added to
what M. de Buffon has collected from diffe∣rent
authors, and accompanied with the fi∣gure,
is sufficient to give us more exact ideas
concerning this animal than we had hitherto
obtained.”</P>
<P>M. Alamand's great knowledge and accuracy,
in every subject of which he treats, are apparent
from the above description. I would have co∣pied
his engraving, if his giraffe had not been
too young. The figure I have given is that of
an adult. I shall only remark, that I suspect
the longest of the horns he was so obliging as
to send me, does not belong to a giraffe. The
short ones are very thick, while it is very thin,
in proportion to their respective lengths. In the
anonymous description above related, it is said,
that the horns of the adult giraffes are <HI>a foot in
length, and as thick as a man's arm.</HI> If the horn
under consideration, which is half a foot long,
<PB N="132" REF="151"/>
really belonged to a giraffe, it ought to be
double its present thickness. Besides, this pre∣tended
horn of a giraffe is so similar to the first
horns of a young stag, that it may be regarded
as belonging to the latter animal.</P>
<P>As to the nature of the giraffe's horns, I am
inclined to adopt M. Alamand's opinion. The
protuberance on the front, which is unquestion∣ably
osseous, makes a kind of third horn. The
horns adhered to the cranium, without the sup∣port
of moulds; and, consequently, ought to be
considered as osseous prolongations of the bones
of the head. The hair which surrounds and
overtops them has no resemblance to that which
covers the young shoots of the stag, or fallow
deer. This hair seems to be permanent, as well
as the skin from which it issues. Hence the
horn of the giraffe is a bone, and differs from
that of the ox by its covering, the latter being
surrounded with a horny substance, or hollow
horn, and the former with hair and skin.

<HEAD>The LAMA<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The lama, or camel of Chili and Peru, has an almost even back, small head, fine black eyes, and very long neck, bending much, and very protuberant near the junction with the body. In a tame state, it has smooth short hair; in a wild state, long coarse hair, which is white, gray, and russet, disposed in spots. According to Hernandez, it is yellowish, with a black line from the head along the top of the back to the tail, and the belly is white. The spotted may possibly be the tame; the last the wild lamas. The tail is short; the height is from four to four and a half feet; and the length, from the neck to the tail, six seet.

<P>IN all languages, two names are frequently
bestowed on the same animal, one of which
relates to its state of liberty, and the other to its
<PB N="134" REF="154"/>
domestic state. The wild boar and hog are the
same animal, and these two names have no re∣lation
to any difference in the nature of the crea∣tures,
but to the condition of the species, one
part of which is under the dominion of man,
and the other independent. The same remark
applies to the lamas and pacos, which were the
only domestic animals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Before the arrival of the Spaniards, the Indians of Peru had no domestic animals but the pacos and the huanacus; <HI>Hist. des Incas, p.</HI> 265.</NOTE> of the antient Ameri∣cans:
These names were appropriated to the a∣nimals
in their domestic condition. The wild
lama was called <HI>huanacus</HI> or <HI>guanaco,</HI> and the
wild pacos, <HI>vicuna,</HI> or <HI>vigogne.</HI> I thought this
remark necessary to prevent confusion. These
<PB N="135" REF="155"/>
animals are peculiar to the New World: They
even love particular lands, beyond which they
are never found. They appear to be confined
to that chain of mountains which extends from
New Spain to Terra Magellancia. They inha∣bit
the most elevated regions of this globe, and
seem to require a lighter air than that of our
highest mountains.</P>
<P>It is singular, that, though the lama and pacos
are domestic in Peru, Mexico, and Chili, as the
horse is in Europe, or the camel in Arabia, we
have hardly any knowledge of them; and that,
though the Spaniards have had the dominion of
these vast countries for more than two centuries,
none of their authors have given a complete hi∣story
and exact description of these animals. It
is alledged, indeed, that they cannot be trans∣ported
into Europe, nor even descend from their
mountains, without perishing in a short time.
But, in Quito, Lima, and other towns, where
men of letters reside, these animals might be
drawn, described, and dissected. Herrera<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the mountains of Peru there is a species of camel, the wool of which is manufactured into cloth; <HI>Descript. des Indes Occidentales, par Herrera, p.</HI> 244.</NOTE> says
very little concerning them; and Garcilasso<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. Blas Vallera remarks, that the cattle of Peru are so mild, that children use them as they please. There is a large and a smaller kind. The tamed huanacus (<HI>lamas</HI>) are of dif∣ferent colours, and the wild kind are all of a bay brown. These animals are about the height of a stag, and resemble the camel, only they want the bunch, and their neck is long and smooth.... The cattle called <HI>paco<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lamas (pacos)</HI> are not nearly so much esteemed.... The pacos are smaller than the lamas, and resemble the wild vicunas. They are very delicate and slender; and their wool, though the quantity of it be small, is extremely fine. Acosta remarks, that this animal, as well as several others, is variously employed as a medicine by the natives; <HI>Hist. des Incas, tom. 2. p.</HI> 260.</NOTE>
<PB N="136" REF="156"/>
only copies what had been mentioned by other
writers. Acosta and Gregoire de Bolivar have
collected the greatest number of facts regarding
the natural dispositions of the lamas, and the utili∣ty
derived from them. But we know nothing of
their internal structure, and of their time of gesta∣tion:
We know not whether the lama and pacos
be two distinct species, or whether they intermix
together. These, and many other facts necessa∣ry
to complete their history, are still objects of in∣quiry.</P>
<P>Though they are said to perish when removed
from their native country, it is certain, that, af∣ter
the conquest of Peru, some lamas were trans∣ported
to Europe. The animal mentioned by
Gesner, under the name of <HI>Allocamelus,</HI> and of
which he gives a figure, is a lama, that was
brought alive from Peru to Holland in the year
1558<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Allocamelus Scaligeri apparet esse hoc ipsum animal cu∣jus figuram proponimus ex charta quadam typis impressa mu∣tuati cum hac descriptione.

and which he has pretty accurately
described. The pacos, and perhaps also the la∣ma,
have several times been brought to Spain,
with a view to naturalize them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The King of Spain ordered pacos to be brought to Spain, in order to propagate and naturalize them. But they were all killed by the climate; <HI>Hist. des aventur. Flibust. par Oexmelin, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m. 2. p.</HI> 367.</NOTE>. We ought,
therefore, to be better informed concerning these
animals, which might be rendered extremely
useful to us; for, it is probable, that they would
<PB N="138" REF="158"/>
thrive on our Alps<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No animal walks so securely upon rocks as the lama; be∣cause he adheres by means of a kind of spur on his feet; <HI>Voyag. de Coreal, tom. 1. p.</HI> 352.</NOTE> and Pyrennees, as well as
on the Cordelieres.</P>
<P>Peru, according to Gregoire de Bolivar, is the
native country of the lamas: They have, indeed,
been brought into other provinces, as New Spain,
where, however, they are regarded more as ob∣jects
of curiosity than of utility. But, through
the whole extent of Peru, from Potosi to Cara∣cas,
these animals are extremely numerous. They
constitute the sole wealth of the Indians, and con∣tribute
not a little to that of the Spaniards. The
flesh of the lamas is good eating; their wool
is excellent; and their whole lives are spent
in transporting the commodities of the country.
Their common load is a hundred and fifty pounds,
and the strongest of them carry two hundred.
They travel pretty long journies in a country
impassable to all other animals. They march
slowly, and seldom accomplish more than four
or five leagues a day. Their gait is grave and
firm. They descend precipitous ravins, and
climb steep rocks, where even man himself
dares not accompany them. They walk com∣monly
four or five days on end, after which
they wish to repose; and they spontaneously
rest twenty-four or thirty hours before they
resume their march. They are much employed
in transporting the rich ores dug out of the mines
of Potosi. Bolivar remarks, that, in his time,
<PB N="139" REF="159"/>
three hundred thousand of these animals were
constantly occupied in this work.</P>
<P>Their growth is quick, and their life is not of
long duration. At the age of three years, they
are in a condition of producing, continue in full
vigour till twelve, when they begin to decay;
and, at fifteen, they are entirely useless. Their
natural disposition seems to be modelled upon
that of the Americans. They are mild and
phlegmatic, and perform every thing by weight
and measure. When they incline to rest a few
minutes in their journey, they bend their knees,
and lower their bodies with the greatest precau∣tion,
to prevent their load from falling, or being
deranged; and, whenever they hear their con∣ductor's
whistle, they rise with the same precau∣tion,
and proceed on their journey. In going
along, they browse wherever they find herbage;
but they never eat in the night, even though
they have been sparingly fed during the day;
for this time is spent in chewing their cud. When
they sleep or ruminate, they rest on their breast,
with their legs folded under their belly. When
fatigued with travelling, if they once sink down
under the load, no blows can force them to rise.
The last resource is to squeeze their testicles;
but even that is often ineffectual. They remain
obstinately where they lie; and, if their master
continues to abuse them, they despair and kill
themselves, by alternately striking their heads from
right to left upon the ground. They neither defend
<PB N="140" REF="160"/>
themselves with their feet nor their teeth, and
they may be said to have no other arms but those
of indignation. They spit in the face of those
who insult them; and, it is alledged, that the
saliva which they throw out when enraged, is so
acrid as to raise blisters on the skin.</P>
<P>The lama is about four feet high, and his bo∣dy,
including the neck and head, is five or six
feet in length. This animal has a well shaped
head, large eyes, a pretty long muzzle, and thick
lips, the superior one being divided, and the in∣ferior
somewhat pendulous. He has neither
cutting nor canine teeth in the upper jaw. His
ears are four inches long, which he carries for∣ward,
erect, and moves at pleasure. The length
of his tail, which is straight, slender, and a little
raised, exceeds not eight inches. His feet are
cloven, like those of the ox; but they are arm∣ed
behind with a spur, which assists the animal
in supporting itself upon rugged and difficult
ground. The wool upon his back, crupper, and
tail, is short, but very long upon the flank and
belly. The lamas vary in colour; some of them
are white, others black, and others of a mixed
colour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The head of the lama is proportionally small, and has some resemblance to that of the goat and sheep. The upper lip is divided like that of the hare: Through this aperture they spit, to the distance of ten paces, upon those who di∣sturb them; and, if the saliva falls upon the face, it inflames or blisters the skin. They have a long neck, which bends downward where it springs from the body, like that of the camel, to which they would have a considerable resemblance, if they had a bunch on the back. Their height is about four feet and a half. They walk with their head erect, and with a pace so uniform, that even blows are incapable of making them move more quickly. They will not carry their loads du∣ring the night; but are obliged to be unloaded, in order to allow them to pasture. They eat little, and are never furnish∣ed with drink. Like the sheep, they have cloven feet, and a spur above, which renders them sure-footed among the rocks. Their wool has a strong odour: It is long, spotted with white, gray, and red, and equally beautiful, though of an inferior quality, with that of the pacos; <HI>Voyage de Frezier, p.</HI> 138.</NOTE>. Their dung resembles that of the goat.
<PB N="141" REF="161"/>
The penis of the male is slender and crooked in
such a manner that he discharges his urine back∣ward.
The lamas are extremely lascivious<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Salacissimum hoc esse animal id mihi conjecturam facit, quod cum sui generis femellis sit destitutum, magna cum pru∣rigine capris se commisceat, non tamen erectis ut aliàs caprae hirco ascendente, solent sed humi ventre accubantibus, ita cogente animali anterioribus cruribus.

Adeo venere, vernali autumnalique tempore, stimulatur hoc animal ut illud viderim humile quoddam praesepium avena refertum conscendisse, ge∣nitaleque illi magno cum murmure tamdiu confricasse, quo usque semen redderet, plurimis una hora replicatis vicibus. Non tamen concepere caprae hujusce animalis semine refertae; <HI>Matthiol. Epist. lib.</HI> 5.</NOTE>,
and yet they copulate with much difficulty. The
aperture of the female is very small. She pro∣strates
herself to receive the male, and invites
him with her sighs. But several hours, and
sometimes a whole day passes, before they can
accomplish their purpose: All this time is spent
in groaning, grumbling, and particularly in con∣spurcating
each other: As these tedious preludes
<PB N="142" REF="162"/>
are more fatiguing than the operation itself, their
keeper abridges their labour, and aids their ar∣rangement
with his hand. They seldom pro∣duce
more than one at a time. The mother has
only two teats, and the young one follows her
the moment after it is brought forth. The flesh
of the young ones is very good; but, when old,
it is dry and hard. The flesh of the domestic is
better than that of the wild lamas, and their
wool is likewise much softer. Their skin is
very compact: The Indians make shoes of it,
and the Spaniards use it for harnesses. The food
of these animals, which are so useful in the
country that produces them, costs almost no∣thing.
As they are cloven-footed, they require
no shoes; and the thick wool with which they
are covered, renders saddles unnecessary. They
have no need of corn or hay; green herbage,
of which they take but small quantities<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The skin of the huanacus is hard: The Indians soften it with grease, and use it for soles to their shoes. But as this leather is not curried, it is soon wasted by the rain: The Spaniards make fine harnesses to their horses of the lama's hide: They employ these animals, as the Indians do, in trans∣porting their merchandise. Their common route is from Cozer to Potosi, which is about two hundred leagues, and their daily journey seldom exceeds three leagues; for they walk slowly, and, if pushed beyond their ordinary pace, they he down, and it is impossible to raise them, even when the load is taken off their backs; so that they often die on the spot.... When transporting goods, they go in troops, and forty or fifty of them are always left unloaded, in order in∣stantly to relieve those which begin to be fatigued. The flesh of this animal is excellent; for it is both well tasted and whole∣some, especially that of the young ones, who exceed not four or five months old.... Though these animals are very numerous, their food costs almost nothing; for, after their journey, they are unloaded, and allowed to pasture in the fields. It is un∣necessary to shoe or saddle them; for they are cloven footed; and their wool prevents them from being incommoded by their load, which their masters take care not to place on their back-bone, otherwise it would kill them.... The conduc∣tors of these animals never enter the towns, but sleep in tents, that their cattle may have an opportunity of pasturing during the night. They take four months in performing a journey from Cozer to Potosi, two in going, and as much in returning.... At Cozer, the best lamas sell at eighteen ducats a piece, and the common sort at twelve or thirteen. The flesh of the wild huanacus is good, but inferior to that of the do∣mestic kind; <HI>Hist. des Incas, tom. 2. p.</HI> 260.</NOTE>, being
<PB N="143" REF="163"/>
sufficient for their nourishment. In drinking,
they are still more moderate. They quench
their thirst with their saliva, which, in this ani∣mal,
is more abundant than in any other.</P>
<P>The huanacus, or lamas in a state of nature,
are stronger, more active, and nimbler than the
domestic kind. They run like the stag, and, like
the wild goat, they climb the steepest rocks.
Though in full possession of liberty, they as∣semble
in flocks, sometimes to the number of
two or three hundred. When they perceive any
person, they look at him with astonishment, dis∣covering
neither fear nor pleasure: They then
blow through their nostrils, neigh nearly like a
horse, and fly off together to the tops of the
mountains. They prefer the north side and the
cold regions of the hills. They often climb and
<PB N="144" REF="164"/>
sojourn above the line of the snow. When tra∣velling
on ice and covered with hoar-frost, they
are in better plight than in a temperate climate.
In the Sierras, which are the most elevated part
of the Cordelieres, they are much more nume∣rous,
and have more strength and vigour than
in the Lanos, which are lower. These wild
lamas are hunted for the sake of their fleeces.
It is difficult for the dogs to follow them; and,
if allowed time to gain the rocks, both the hun∣ters
and dogs are obliged to abandon them. They
seem to be as much afraid of the weight of the
air as of heat; for they are never found in low
lands: And, as the chain of the Cordelieres,
which is more than three thousand fathoms above
the level of the sea at Peru, preserves nearly the
same elevation from Chili to the straits of Ma∣gellan,
the huanacus or wild lamas are very nu∣merous
throughout all that extent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the neighbourhood of Port Desire, at some distance from the Straits of Magellan, we found a number of those wild sheep which the Spaniards call <HI>Winaques....</HI> Though very alert and timid, we killed seven of them during our stay; and their wool seems to be much finer than that of any other animal.... They go in flocks of five or seven hundred; and, as soon as they perceive any person, they snort with their noses, and neigh like horses; <HI>Wood's Voyage, in Dampier, vol. 4. p.</HI> 95.—We saw, at Tucuman, a province adjacent to Peru, large sheep, which were used as beasts of burden, and whose wool was as fine as silk; <HI>Travels of Woods Rogers, tom 2. p.</HI> 65.</NOTE>. But, on

sink considerably lower, no lamas are to be found,
<PB N="145" REF="165"/>
except the domestic kind which are brought
thither.</P>
<P>The pacos are a species which may supply
that of the lamas, as the ass might supply the
place of the horse. They are smaller, and less
proper for labour; but their fleeces are more
useful. The long wool with which they are
covered, is an article of luxury, as good and as
precious as silk. The pacos, which are also cal∣led
<HI>alpaques,</HI> when in a domestic state, are often
totally black, and sometimes of a brown colour
mixed with yellow. The wild pacos have the
colour of dried roses; and this natural colour is
so fixed, that it suffers no change from the hand
of the workman. Their wool makes excellent
gloves, stockings, bed-clothes, and carpets. This
commodity alone constitutes a valuable branch
of commerce to the Spaniards. The beaver of
Canada, the Calmuck sheep, and the Syrian goat,
furnish not a finer hair: That of the pacos is
as dear as silk. This animal possesses many
things in common with the lama. It belongs
exclusively to the same country; for it exists no
where but on the Cordelieres. It has likewise
the same dispositions, and nearly the same man∣ners
and temperament. As its wool, however,
is longer and more bushy, it seems to be still less
afraid of cold. It dwells more freely among
the snows and ice of cold countries, and is ex∣tremely
numerous in Terra Magellanica<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the east coast of Patagonia, near the river Plata, the vigognes are very numerous. But these animals are so timid and fleet, that it is very difficult to seize them; <HI>Anson's Voyage.</HI>—The most common quadrupeds in Port St Julian, in Terra Magellanica, are the guanacos; <HI>Hist. du Paraguai, par Charle∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ix, t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m. 6. p.</HI> 207.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="166"/>
The pacos also resemble the lama in figure;
but they are smaller, their legs are shorter, and
their muzzle is more contracted. Their wool
is of the colour of dried roses. They have no
horns. They live and pasture on the most ele∣vated
parts of the mountains. Snow and ice
seem rather to refresh than incommode them.
They go in flocks, and run nimbly. They are
very timid; and, when they perceive any per∣son,
they fly off, driving their young before
them. The hunting of the pacos was rigorous∣ly
prohibited by the antient kings of Peru, be∣cause
these animals do not multiply fast. At
present, they are much less numerous than at the
time the Spaniards first took possession of that
country. Their flesh is not so good as that of
the huanacus; and they are sought after solely
for the sake of their wool, and the bezoars which
they produce. The manner of taking them
shows their timidity, or perhaps their weakness.
Several people assemble to chace these animals
in some narrow desile, across which cords are
stretched to the height of three or four feet, with
pieces of linen or woollen cloth fixed upon them.
When the pacos arrive, the motion of the pieces
of cloth, produced by the wind, so terrifies them,
that they dare not pass, but collect in large groups,
<PB N="147" REF="167"/>
which makes it an easy business to kill vast
numbers of them. But, if there happen to be
any huanacus in the flock, as they are taller and
less timid than the pacos, they spring over the
cords; and, when the example is once set, the
pacos likewise leap and escape from the hun∣ters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Frezier, p. 138.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>With regard to the domestic pacos, they are
employed, like the lamas, in carrying burdens;
but they cannot bear as much weight even in
proportion to their size. They are still more
subject to capricious obstinacy. When once
they lie down with their load, rather than rise,
they will suffer themselves to be cut in pieces.
The Indians make no use of the milk of these
animals; because they never yield more than is
necessary to fuckle their young. The great pro∣fits
derived from their wool induced the Spa∣niards
to endeavour to naturalize the pacos in
Europe. They were transported into Spain; but
the climate destroyed them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. des aventures des Flibustiers, p. 367.</NOTE>. I am persuaded,
however, as I formerly remarked, that these ani∣mals
might succeed in our mountains, and par∣ticularly
in the Pyrennees. Those who brought
them to Spain did not consider that, even in
Peru, they subsist only in the cold region, or
upon the tops of the highest mountains; that
they are never found in low lands; that they die
in warm countries; that, on the contrary, they
<PB N="148" REF="168"/>
are at present very numerous in the neighbour∣hood
of the straits of Magellan, where the cold
is much more intense than in the south of Eu∣rope;
and, consequently, that, in order to pre∣serve
them, they should be landed, not in Spain,
but in Scotland, or even in Norway. The foot
of the Pyrennees, Alps, &amp;c. would probably an∣swer
the intention still better, where they could
climb to the region which was most agreeable to
their constitution. I have dwelt the longer on
this subject, because I imagine that these animals
would be a great acquisition to Europe, and
would be productive of more real advantage than
all the metals of the New World, which only
load us with an useless weight<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What advantage have we derived from the rich mines of Peru? To procure these metals, millions of men have perish∣ed in the bowels of the earth, and their blood and labours have answered no other purpose, than to load us with an un∣necessary weight.</NOTE>, since a grain
of gold or silver was formerly equal in value to
what now costs us an ounce of these metals.</P>
<P>Animals which feed upon herbs and inhabit
the high mountains of Asia and Africa, produce
what are called the <HI>oriental bezoars,</HI> whose vir∣tues
are so much extolled. Those of the Euro∣pean
mountains, where the qualities of the plants
are more temperate, produce only useless balls
called <HI>aegagropili;</HI> and, in South America, all
the animals that inhabit the mountains of the
Torrid Zone, furnish what are denominated <HI>oc∣cidental
bezoars,</HI> which are still more solid, and
<PB N="149" REF="169"/>
have, perhaps, higher virtues than the <HI>oriental.</HI>
The <HI>vigogne,</HI> or wild pacos, produces a great
number, as well as the huanacus. These stones
are likewise produced by the stags and roebucks
on the mountains of New Spain. The lamas
and pacos produce no fine bezoars, unless when
in their natural wild state. The domestic kind
afford only small, black bezoars, without any
virtue. The best stones are of a dark green co∣lour,
and generally proceed from the wild pacos,
particularly those which inhabit the highest parts
of the mountains, and commonly pasture among
the snows. Of these mountain pacos, both the
males and females produce bezoars. They hold
the first rank after the oriental bezoars, and are
in much higher estimation than those of New
Spain, which proceed from stags, and are less
efficacious than any of the other kinds.</P>

<P>THESE two animals have been denomina∣ted
<HI>sloths,</HI> on account of the slowness of
their movements, and the difficulty with which
they walk. Though they resemble each other
in many respects, they differ, both externally
and internally, by characters so marked, that it is
<PB N="151" REF="171"/>
impossible not to recognise them as very di∣stinct
species. The unau, or two-toed sloth,
has no tail, and only two claws on the fore-feet:
The aï, or three-toed sloth, has a tail, and three
claws on all the feet. The muzzle of the for∣mer
is longer, the front more elevated, and the
ears more apparent than those of the latter.
Their hair is also very different. The structure
<PB N="152" REF="172"/>
and situation of some parts of their viscera are
likewise different. But the most remarkable
distinction is derived from this singular circum∣stance,
that the unau has forty-six ribs, and the
aï only twenty-eight, which shows them to be
species very remote from each other. This num∣ber
of ribs, in the body of an animal so short, is
an excess or error of Nature; for no animal,
however large, has such a number of ribs: The
elephant has only forty, the horse thirty-six,
the badger thirty, the dog twenty-six, man
twenty-four, &amp;c. This difference in the struc∣ture
of the sloths indicates a greater distance
between these two species than between the dog
and cat, who have both the same number of
ribs; for external differences are nothing when
compared to those which are internal: The
former may be regarded as causes, and the lat∣ter
as effects only. The interior frame of ani∣mated
beings is the foundation of Nature's plan;
it is the constituent form, and the origin of all
figure: But the external parts are only the
surface or drapery. How often have we not
found, in the course of our comparative exami∣nation
of animals, that a very different exter∣nal
appearance covered internal parts perfectly
similar; and that, on the contrary, the slightest
internal distinction produced great external dif∣ferences,
and changed the natural dispositions,
powers, and qualities of the animal? How many
animals are armed, covered, and adorned with ex∣crescent
<PB N="153" REF="173"/>
parts, whose external structure corre∣sponds
exactly with others which are totally de∣prived
of such appendages? But this is not a
proper place for such nice disquisitions. We
shall only remark, that, in proportion as Nature
is vivacious, active, and exalted in the monkey
kind, she is slow, restrained, and fettered in the
sloths. From a defect in their conformation,
the misery of these animals is not more conspi∣cuous
than their slowness. They have no cut∣ting
teeth; the eyes are obscured with hair; the
chops are heavy and thick; the hair is flat,
and resembles withered herbs; the thighs are ill
jointed to the haunches; the legs are too short,
ill turned, and terminated still worse: Their
feet have no soles, and no toes which move se∣parately,
but only two or three claws dispropor∣tionally
long, and bended downward, which
move together, and are more hurtful to their
walking, than advantageous in assisting them to
climb. Slowness, habitual pain, and stupidity,
are the results of this strange and bungled con∣formation.
The sloths have no weapons either
offensive or defensive. They are furnished with
no means of safety; for they can neither fly nor
dig the earth. Confined to a small space, or to
the tree under which they are brought forth,
they are prisoners in the midst of space, and
cannot move the length of one fathom in an
hour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perillo ligero, sive canicula agilis, animal est omnium quae viderim ignavissimum; nam adeo lente movetur, ut ad conficiendum iter longum dumtaxat quinquaginta passus, in∣tegro die illi opus sit.—In aedes translatum naturali sua tarditate movetur, nec a clamatione ulla aut impulsione gra∣dum accelerat; <HI>Oviedo in summario Ind.

<PB N="154" REF="174"/>
much labour and pain. Their cry and inter∣rupted
accents they dare only utter during the
<PB N="155" REF="175"/>
night. All these circumstances announce the
misery of the sloths, and recall to our minds those
defective monsters, those imperfect sketches of
Nature, which, being hardly endowed with the
faculty of existence, could not subsist for any
length of time, and have accordingly been struck
out of the list of beings. If the regions inhabit∣ed
by the sloths were not desert, but had been
long occupied by men and the larger animals,
these species would never have descended to
our times: They would have been annihilated,
as in some future period will be the case. We
formerly remarked, that every thing that possi∣bly
could be, really did exist; of which the sloths
are a striking example. They constitute the last
term of existence in the order of animals en∣dowed
with flesh and blood. One other defect
added to the number would have totally prevent∣ed
their existence. To regard those bungled
sketches as beings equally perfect with others,
to call in the aid of final causes to account
for such disproportioned productions, and to
make Nature as brilliant in these as in her most
beautiful animals, is to view her through a nar∣row
tube, and to substitute our own fancies for
her intentions.</P>
<P>Why should not some animals be created for
misery, since, in the human species, the greatest
number of individuals are devoted to pain from
the moment of their existence? Evil, it is true,
proceeds more from ourselves than from Nature.
<PB N="156" REF="176"/>
For a single person who is unhappy, because he
was born feeble or deformed, there are millions
rendered miserable by the oppression of their su∣periors.
The animals, in general, are more hap∣py,
because the species have nothing to fear from
individuals: To them there is but one source of
evil; to man there are two. Moral evil, of
which he himself is the fountain, has accumu∣lated
into an immense ocean, which covers and
afflicts the whole surface of the earth. Physical
evil, on the contrary, is restrained within very
narrow bounds: It seldom appears alone; for it
is always accompanied with an equal, if not a
superior good. Can happiness be denied to ani∣mals,
when they enjoy freedom, have the facul∣ty
of procuring subsistence with ease, and possess
more health, and organs capable of affording
greater pleasure than those of the human species?
Now, the generality of animals are most liberally
endowed with all these sources of enjoyment.
The degraded species of sloths are perhaps the
only creatures to whom Nature has been unkind,
and who exhibit to us the picture of innate mi∣sery.</P>
<P>Let us take a closer view of the condition of
these creatures. By the want of teeth, they can
neither seize prey, nor feed upon flesh or her∣bage.
Reduced to the necessity of living upon
leaves and wild fruits, they consume much time
in trailing their bodies to the foot of a tree, and
<PB N="157" REF="177"/>
still more in climbing to the branches<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is alledged by the natives, that this animal lives solely on the leaves of a certain tree, called in their language <HI>Ama∣hut.</HI> This tree is higher than any other in that country. Its leaves are very small and delicate; and, because the sloth is commonly found in these trees, they have given it the name of <HI>Haut; Singul▪ de la France Antarc, par Thevet, p.</HI> 100.—The sloth lives solely on the leaves of trees, and the highest bran∣ches serve him for a retreat; but it costs him two days jour∣ney to arrive at them.... Neither caresses, threatenings, nor even blows, can make him move quicker; <HI>Hist. des Indes, par Maffé, p. 71. Herrera, p.</HI> 252.—The sloth is not so large, nor so rough as the <HI>tamanoir,</HI> or great ant-eater.... He feeds upon leaves.... These animals do much mischief to trees; after eating all the leaves of one tree, they employ five or six days in descending it and climbing another, however nearly situated; and, though plump and fat when they be∣gin their journey, they are reduced to skin and bone before they finish it. They never abandon a tree till they have made it as bare as it can be in the middle of winter; <HI>Dampier's Voyage.</HI>—They climb trees, but so slowly, that they are easily taken. When seized, they make no resistance, and never attempt to fly. If a long pole is presented to the sloth, he begins to mount it; but the slowness of his motion is tiresome: When he arrives at the top, he remains there, without taking the trouble of de∣scending; <HI>Voyage de Cayenne, par Binet, p.</HI> 341.—The sloths have four legs, which they employ only in climbing: When perched upon a tree, they never quit it till they have eat the whole leaves. They then descend, and mount another, the leaves of which they devour in the same manner.—We placed this animal on the lowest sail of the fore-mast▪ It spent two hours in climbing to the scuttle, which a monkey would have accomplished in half a minute. One would imagine that it moves by a spring, like the pendulum of a clock; <HI>Travels by Woods Rogers.</HI></NOTE>; and, du∣ring
this slow and melancholy exercise, which
sometimes lasts several days, they are obliged to
suffer the most pressing hunger. When arrived
<PB N="158" REF="178"/>
upon a tree, they never descend. They cling to
the branches, and devour successively the leaves
of every twig. They pass several weeks in this
situation, without receiving any drink. When
they have rendered the tree entirely naked, they
still remain; because they cannot descend. In
fine, when the pressure of hunger becomes supe∣rior
to the dread of danger or death, being un∣able
to descend, they allow themselves to tumble
down like an inanimated mass; for their stiff and
inactive limbs have not time to extend them∣selves
in order to break the fall.</P>
<P>When on the ground, they are at the mercy
of all their enemies. As their flesh is not abso∣lutely
bad, both men and rapacious animals go
in quest of these animals. It appears that they
do not multiply fast, or, at least, if they produce
frequently, it must be in small numbers at a time;
for they have only two paps. Every circum∣stance,
therefore, concurs to destroy them; and
it is extremely difficult for the species to support
itself. But, though slow, awkward, and almost
incapable of motion, they are obstinate, strong,
and tenacious of life. They can live very long
without victuals of any kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I had a present of a living <HI>haut,</HI> which I kept twenty-six days, during which he neither eat nor drank; <HI>Singular. de la France Ant. par Thevet, p.</HI> 99.</NOTE>. They are co∣vered
with thick, dry hair; and, being incapable
of exercise, they lose little by perspiration; and,
though their food be meager, they fatten by re∣pose.
<PB N="159" REF="179"/>
Though they have no horns nor hoofs,
nor cutting teeth in the under jaw, yet they be∣long
to the ruminating tribes, and have several
stomachs. Hence the quality of their food may
be compensated by the quantity they take at a
time. What is still more singular, instead of
very long intestines, like other ruminating ani∣mals,
their guts are very short and small, like
those of the carnivorous kind. This contrast ex∣hibits
the ambiguity of Nature. The sloths are
unquestionably ruminating animals: They have
four stomachs; and yet they want every other
character, both internal and external, which ge∣nerally
belongs to animals of this class. There
is still another singularity in the conformation of
the sloths: Instead of three distinct apertures for
the discharge of urine and excrements, and for
the purposes of generation, these animals have
but one, which terminates in a common canal, as
in birds.</P>
<P>Moreover, if the misery resulting from a de∣fect
of sentiment be not the worst of all, the pain
endured by the sloths, though very apparent,
seems not to be real; for their sensations appear
to be blunt. Their calamitous air, their dull a∣spect,
and their reception of blows without emo∣tion,
announce their extreme insensibility. This
bluntness of sensation is farther demonstrated, by
their not dying instantly when their hearts and
bowels are entirely cut out. Piso, who made
<PB N="160" REF="180"/>

after being separated from the body, beat in a
lively manner for half an hour; and that the a∣nimal
continued to contract its legs slowly, as
commonly happens during sleep. From these
facts, this quadruped seems to approach not only
the turtle, but the other reptiles which have no
distinct centre of sensation. All these beings may
be said to be miserable, but not unhappy: Na∣ture,
even in her most neglected productions,
always appears more in the character of a parent
than of a stepmother.</P>
<P>These two animals are peculiar to the southern
regions of the New Continent, and are no where
to be found in the Old. We formerly remark∣ed,
that the editor of Seba's cabinet was decei∣ved
when he calls the tow-toed sloth, or unau,
the <HI>sloth of Ceylon.</HI> This error, which has been
<PB N="161" REF="181"/>
adopted by Klein, Linnaeus, and Brisson, is now
more evident than it was formerly. The Marquis
de Montmirail has a live unau, which was trans∣mitted
to him from Surinam: Those we have in
the Royal Cabinet were brought from the same
place and from Guiana; and I am persuaded that
both species exist through the whole deserts of
America, from Brasil<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The aï, or three-toed sloth, described and engraven by Edwards, came from the Bay of Honduras; and Ulloa says, that it is found in the environs of Porto-bello.</NOTE> to Mexico. But, as they
have never frequented the northern regions, they
could not pass from the one Continent to the o∣ther.
If these animals have sometimes been seen
in the East Indies, or on the coast of Africa, it
is certain that they must have been transported
thither. They cannot endure cold; and they
likewise dread rain. The alternation of moisture
and dryness changes their fur, which has more
the appearance of ill dressed hemp than of wool
or hair.</P>
<P>I shall finish this article with some observations
communicated to me by the Marquis de Mont∣mirail,
concerning an unau, or two-toed sloth,
which he fed three years in his menagerie: “The
hair of the unau is much softer than that of
the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.... All that has been said by travellers
concerning the excessive slowness of the sloths
should, probably, be applied only to the aï,
or three-toed species. The unau, though very
heavy, and of an extremely awkward gait,
<PB N="162" REF="182"/>
mounted and descended the highest tree several
times in a day. It is in the evening and du∣ring
the night that he was most active, which
made me suspect that he saw very ill in the day,
and that his eyes were of no use to him but in
the dark. I purchased this animal at Amster∣dam.
It was fed with sea biscuit; and I was
told, that, during the verdure of the trees, it
would require nothing but leaves. We gave
him leaves, which he eat freely, when they
were tender; but, as soon as they began to dry,
or were pierced by caterpillars, he refused them.
During the three years that I kept him alive in
my menagerie, his ordinary food was bread,
apples, and roots; and his drink was milk.
He always laid hold, though with difficulty, of
what he wanted to eat, with his fore paws; and
the difficulty increased in proportion to the
largeness of the morsel. He seldom cried;
his cry is short, and he never repeats it twice,
without a considerable interval. This cry,
though plaintive, has no resemblance to that of
the aï, if it be true that <HI>aï</HI> is the sound of that
animal's voice. The most natural situation of
the unau, and which he prefers to all others,
is hanging on a branch, with his body turned
downward. He sometimes sleeps in this po∣sition,
his fore paws being fixed to the same
point, and his body forming an arch. The
strength of his muscles is incredible; but it be∣comes
useless to him when he walks; for his
<PB N="163" REF="183"/>
motion is constrained and wavering. This
structure alone seems to be the cause of the ani∣mal's
slowness, which, besides, has no violent
appetites, and does not recognise those who
take care of him.”</P>

<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>M. de la Borde remarks, that there are two
species of these animals in Cayenne, the one
called the <HI>bashful sloth,</HI> and the other the <HI>sheep-sloth.</HI>
The latter is twice as long as the former,
and of the same thickness. He has long, bushy,
whitish hair, and weighs about twenty-five
pounds. He throws himself down upon men
from the tops of trees, but in a manner so slug∣gish,
that it is easy to avoid him. He feeds du∣ring
the day as well as the night.</P>
<P>“The bashful sloth,” M. de la Borde remarks,
“has black spots on his body, weighs twelve
pounds, keeps always on trees, and eats the
leaves of the Surinam fig-tree, which are said
to be poisonous. The bowels of this sloth
poison dogs, and yet the flesh is good eating;
but its use is confined to the common people.”</P>
<P>“Both species produce only a single young,
which they always carry on their back. It is
<PB N="164" REF="184"/>
probable, though I am not certain, that the fe∣males
bring forth on trees. They feed on the
leaves of the Brasilian plumb-tree<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spondias lutea of Linnaeus.</NOTE>, and of
the Surinam fig. The two species are equally
common; but they are not frequent in the en∣virons
of Cayenne. They sometimes suspend
themselves by their claws on branches of trees
which hang over the rivers; and, when in this
situation, it is easy to cut the branch and make
them fall into the water; for they never quit
their hold.”</P>
<P>“When ascending a tree, this animal carelessly
stretches out one of its fore pats, and fixes its
long claw as high as it can reach. It then
heavily raises its body, gradually fixes the o∣ther
pat; and, in this manner, continues to
climb. All these movements are incredibly
slow and languid. When kept in houses, they
always climb upon some post or door, and ne∣ver
choose to rest on the ground. If a stick is
held out to them when on the ground, they
lay hold of it, and mount to its top, where they
firmly adhere with their fore paws, and em∣brace
the stick with their whole body. They
have a weak plaintive cry, which is heard at no
great distance.”</P>
<P>From this passage, it is obvious, that the sheep-sloth
is the same with what we have called
<HI>unau,</HI> or the three-toed sloth; and that the bash∣ful-sloth
is the <HI>aï,</HI> or two-toed species.

M. Vosmaër, an able naturalist, and superin∣tendent
of the Prince of Orange's cabinet, has
criticised two assertions in my history of these
animals. He remarks, “that we ought to reject
the relation of M. de Buffon, when he tells us,
that the sloths are unable to descend from a
tree, but allow themselves to fall down like
blocks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descript. d'un paresseux pentedactile de Bengale, p. 5.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>I advanced this fact on the authority of eye∣witnesses,
who assured me, that they had some∣times
seen the animal fall down at their feet.
The fact is farther supported by the testimony of
M. de la Borde. What I have said on this sub∣ject,
therefore, ought by no means to be rejec∣ted.</P>
<P>The second assertion is not equally well found∣ed.
I willingly acknowledge my mistake, when
I said that the sloths had no teeth, and I thank
M. Vosmaër for correcting this error.</P>

In∣stead of South America, Mr Pennant says, that it inhabits the Cape of Good Hope and the island of Java, and refers, for his authorities, to <HI>Pallas, Miscel. Zool. p.</HI> 59. 60. and <HI>Rumph. Herb. Amboin. app. p.</HI> 71. The latter, when speaking of the ichneumon, or muncos, says, “ac distinguendus est a suracat∣je seu <HI>Javanorum</HI> zupe, quod est mustela.”</NOTE>. We fed it for some time; and after∣wards
M. de Seve, who has drawn, with equal
skill and attention, the animals published in this
work, having kept it alive during several months,
communicated to me the remarks he had made
with regard to its natural habits and dispositions.
It is a handsome, active, and dexterous animal,
sometimes walking on end, and frequently sit∣ting
<PB N="167" REF="190"/>
upright, with his fore feet hanging down,
his head erect, and moving on the neck as up∣on
a pivot. He always assumed this attitude
when he came near the fire to warm himself.
He is not so large as a rabbit, and pretty much
resembles the ichneumon, both in size and hair,
only it is rougher, and the tail is not so long.
But, by the prominency of the upper part of
the muzzle, he makes a nearer approach to the
coati, or Brasilian Weasel, than to any other a∣nimal.
He has also a character which is pecu∣liar
to him and the hyaena; for they are the
only animals which have four toes on all their
feet.</P>
<P>At first, we fed this surikate with milk, be∣cause
he was very young: But his taste for
flesh soon appeared. He eat raw meat, and par∣tïcularly
the flesh of chickens, with great avidi∣ty.
He likewise endeavoured to seize young a∣nimals.
A young rabbit, which lived in the
same house, would have fallen a prey to him,
if he had not been prevented from making the
attack. He was fond of fish, and still fonder
of eggs. I have seen him carry off, with his
two paws, eggs which had been put into the wa∣ter
to be boiled. He refused fruits, and even
bread, unless it was mashed. Like the squirrel,
he employed his fore paws to convey his vic∣tuals
to his mouth. In drinking, he lapped like
a dog, and never drank water but when it was
warm. His ordinary drink was his own urine,
<PB N="168" REF="191"/>
though it had a very strong odour. He fro∣licked
with the cats, and always innocently.
He did no harm to the children, and never bit
any person but the master of the house, to whom
he had taken an aversion. He never gnawed
with his teeth, but often injured the plaster and
furniture by scratching with his claws. He was
so well tamed, that he knew his own name.
He went about through the whole house, and
returned whenever he was called. He uttered
two kinds of sounds. When he was tired by
being alone, or heard any unusual noise, he bark∣ed
like a young dog; and, when he was cares∣sed,
or felt any pleasant emotion, he made a noise
as brisk and striking as a small rattle rapidly
turned round. This animal was a female, and
appeared to be frequently in season, notwith∣standing
the coldness of the climate, which,
though every thing was done to cherish and
keep her warm, she could support during one
winter only.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>We formerly remarked, that the surikate did
no injury to children; and that it never bit any
person but adults, and, among others, the master
of the family, against whom it had taken an a∣version.
I since learned that it never attacked
<PB N="169" REF="192"/>
either the mother or the children of his family,
but that it bit a number of other persons of both
sexes. M. de Sève remarked, that it was indu∣ced
to bite by some particular odour. When
laid hold of, the cartilage at the end of its nose
curled up while it smelled, and, according to the
odour received, it either bit or did not bite. This
experiment was tried upon a number of people;
and, it is singular, whenever it bit one person,
it always continued to bite him. Some people
were so disagreeable to him, that he endeavour∣ed
to make his escape in order to bite them;
and, when he could not lay hold of the legs, he
darted upon their shoes or pettycoats. He e∣ven
used several artifices to come near those
whom he wished to bite.</P>
<P>M. Vosmaër, in his description of a flying
squirrel, makes the following pertinent remarks.</P>
<P>“M. de Buffon,” says M. Vosmaër, “has pro∣bably
been deceived both with regard to the
name and the native country of the surikate,
which was last summer transmitted by M. Tul∣bagh
to the Prince of Orange. It belongs not
to America, but to Africa. This small animal,
a male and a female of which were directed to
me, but the female died in the passage, was
unknown to Kolbe, or at least is not mention∣ed
by him, appears to be found far up the
country only: This inference may be drawn
from the governour's letter, which I received
at the same time, and where he makes the fol∣lowing
<PB N="170" REF="193"/>
remark: <HI>I send by the Captain two
small animals, a male and a female, to which
I can neither give a name, nor refer them to a∣ny
other species; because they were, for the
first time, brought from the remote deserts and
stony mountains of this vast country. They are
very mild and gentle. They feed upon fresh
meat, either boiled or raw, eggs, and ants. I
hope they will arrive in life; for, I imagine, they
were never hitherto seen in Europe.</HI>”</P>
<P>The evidence of M. Tulbagh is positive, and
M. de Vosmaër's remark is just; for, though I
had this animal alive for a long time, I received
its name and country from no better authority
than an animal merchant, who told me he had
purchased it in Holland under the name of <HI>suri∣kate,</HI>
and that it came from Surinam. We are
now certain that it is neither found in Surinam
nor in the other provinces of South America,
but in the mountains of Africa above the Cape
of Good Hope; and, as to the name, it is of
little moment: It can be changed when we re∣ceive
better information.</P>

<HEAD>The TARSIER, or WOOLLY
JERBOA<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The jerboa with a sharp pointed nose, long, erect, naked, transparent ears, large eyes, two cutting teeth in each jaw, and, what is peculiar to this species, two canine teeth in each. It has five long slender fingers on each foot, resem∣bling those of a monkey. The fore legs are moderately long. The hind legs are of a very remarkable length, especially the second bone; that next the foot is slender and naked. The tail is exceedingly long and slender. The hair on the body is long, soft, and woolly. The head is ash-coloured, and the rest of the body tawny, mixed with ash-colour. It is larger than a common mouse; <HI>Pennant's Synops. of quad. p.</HI> 298.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>WE accidentally procured this animal from
a person who could neither tell its name,
nor from whence it came. It is remarkable for
the excessive length of its hind legs. The bones
of the feet, and particularly those which com∣pose
the upper part of the <HI>tarsus,</HI> are prodigi∣ously
long; and it is from this distinctive cha∣racter
that we have derived the name of the
animal. The tarsier, however, is not the only
quadruped whose hind legs are constructed in this
manner. The tarsus of the Egyptian Jerboa
is still longer. Hence the appellation of <HI>tarsier</HI>
is only precarious, and ought to be changed as
soon as we learn the name which the animal re∣ceives
in the country where it is produced. The
Jerboa is found in Egypt, Barbary, and the East
<PB N="172" REF="196"/>
Indies. I at first imagined that the tarsier might
belong to the same countries, on account of its
resemblance to the jerboa. Both these animals
are of the size of a middling rat. The hind legs
of both are excessively long, and those before
very short. In both, the tail is of a prodigious
length, and garnished toward the extremity with
long hairs. Both have very large eyes, and erect,
large, open ears. In both, the inferior part of
the hind legs are naked, while the rest of the
body is covered with hair. As these animals
possess, in common, such peculiar characters, it
might be presumed that they were neighbour∣ing
species, or, at least, species produced by the
same climate and country. From a comparison
of their other parts, however, this is rendered
extremely doubtful. The tarsier has five toes
on all his feet, and may be said to have four
hands; for his five toes are very long, and well
separated. The thumbs of the hind feet termi∣nate
in a flat nail; and, though the nails of the
other toes be pointed, they are so short and
small, that the animal can use its fore feet in
the same manner as hands. The jerboa, on the
contrary, has only four toes, and four long
crooked claws on the fore feet; and, instead of
a thumb, it has only a tubercle without any nail.
But, what removes these animals to a greater
distance, the jerboa has but three toes, or three
large claws, on the hind feet. This distinction
is too great for animals nearly allied in species;
<PB REF="197"/>
<FIGURE>

and it is not impossible that they belong to very
distant climates; for the tarsier, by his small
size, his four hands, long toes, and small claws,
and his long tail and feet, seems to make a near
approach to the Murine, Mexican, and Surinam
opossums. But we here throw out our doubts
only; and shall be highly obliged to any person
who can ascertain or remove them, by point∣ing

concerning their manners and disposi∣tions.
We fed one of these animals during se∣veral
months, in order to examine it attentively,
and afterwards dissected it, with a view to com∣pare
its internal structure with that of other rats.
In its anterior parts, it has a greater resemblance
to the water rat than to any other animal. It
resembles him still more in the smallness of its
eyes and the fineness of its skin. But the tail, in∣stead
of being long, is shorter than that of the
compagnol or short-tailed mouse, which, as for∣merly
remarked, has a great similarity to the
water rat in its internal conformation. The
hamster seems to be, with regard to the short-tailed
field mouse, what the surmulot, or Nor∣way
rat, is to the long-tailed field mouse. All
these animals live under ground, and appear
to be animated with the same instinct. They
have nearly the same manners, and particularly
that of collecting magazines of grain in their
holes. We shall not, therefore, enlarge so much

all the other authors put together. He dis∣sected
the hamster, and gave a description of
it, which corresponds almost in every article
<PB N="182" REF="210"/>
with ours; yet he is hardly quoted by our more
modern naturalists, who content themselves with
copying Gesner. In justice to this author, we
have inserted his remarks entire; and, when
to these we add the observations of M. de Waitz,
the history of this animal will be complete.</P>
<P>“The habitations of the hamster are different∣ly
constructed, according to their sex, age,
and the quality of the ground. The house
of the male has an oblique passage, at the
mouth of which there is a considerable heap
of earth. At a distance from this oblique
passage, there is a hole which descends perpen∣dicularly
<PB N="183" REF="211"/>
into the chambers of the lodging.
No earth appears near this hole; which ren∣ders
it probable that the oblique passage is dug
from without, and that the perpendicular hole
is begun from below, and continued upward.”</P>
<P>“The house of the female has likewise an ob∣lique
passage, and, at the same time, two,
three, and not unfrequently eight perpendicu∣lar
holes, in order to allow her young to go out
and in at pleasure. The male and female have
each a different dwelling, and the female
makes her's deeper than the male.”</P>
<P>“At the distance of a foot or two on each
side of the perpendicular holes, the hamsters
of both sexes, according to their age, and their
number of young, dig one, two, three, and
sometimes four cavities in the form of vaults,
both above and below, which are more or less
capacious in proportion to the quantity of
their provisions.”</P>
<P>“The perpendicular hole is the common pas∣sage:
The oblique one is made for the pur∣pose
of carrying out the earth. As the decli∣vity
of this oblique passage is more gentle in
one cavity than in another, it may likewise pro∣mote
a circulation of air in those subterrane∣ous
habitations. In the cavern where the female
brings forth her young, there is no magazine
of grain, but a nest of straw and herbs. The
depth of the caverns is various: A young
hamster, in the first year, makes his cavern not
<PB N="184" REF="212"/>
above a foot deep; but the old ones frequent∣ly
dig to the depth of four or five feet. The
whole habitation, including the passages and
caverns, is sometimes from eight to ten feet
in diameter.”</P>
<P>“These animals provide their magazines with
dry clean grain, corn in the ear, peas and
beans in their pods, and afterwards carry out
the husks and pods by the oblique passages.
In transporting their provisions, they use the
pouches in their cheeks, each of which will
hold a quarter of an English pint.”</P>
<P>“The hamster begins to lay up provisions a∣bout
the end of August. When his magazines
are filled, he covers them, and carefully shuts
up all the avenues with earth, which prevents
his retreat from being easily discovered, and
it is only to be recognised by the heap of
earth near the oblique passage mentioned a∣bove;
after which, the perpendicular holes
must be investigated. The most common me∣thod
of seizing these animals is to dig them
out, which is a laborious task, on account of
the extent and depth of their holes. A per∣son,
however, who accustoms himself to this
species of hunting, fails not to profit by it;
for, in autumn, which is the proper season, he
generally finds in each habitation, beside the
fur of the animal, two bushels of good grain.
The hamsters produce twice or thrice in a year,
and bring forth five or six, and often more,
<PB N="185" REF="213"/>
at each litter. In some years they appear in
prodigious numbers, and, in others, hardly
any of them are to be seen. It is in moist
years that they multiply so greatly; and this
numerous multiplication occasions a dearth, by
the general devastation they make among the
corn.”</P>
<P>“At the age of six weeks or two months,
the hamsters begin to dig their habitations;
but they neither couple nor produce during
the first year.”</P>
<P>“The polecats destroy great numbers of the
hamsters, and take possession of their holes.”</P>
<P>“The hamsters are commonly brown on the
back and white on the belly. Some of them,
however, are gray; and this difference may
be the effect of advanced age. Some of them
are also totally black.”</P>
<P>Like the mulet, or long-tailed field mouse,
the hamsters mutually destroy each other. Of
two kept in a cage, the female killed the male
in one night, and, after cutting the muscles
which fix the jaws to each other, devoured
a part of the intestines. They produce several
times in the year, and are so destructive, that,
in the states of Germany, a price is set upon
their heads. They are so numerous in that part
of the Continent, that their fur is a considerable
article of commerce.</P>
<P>All these facts, which we have extracted
from the memoir of M. Waitz, and the remarks
<PB N="186" REF="214"/>
of M. de Montmirail, appear to be certain, and
correspond with our other sources of informa∣tion
concerning the hamsters. But it is not e∣qually
certain, as mentioned in the same me∣moir,
that they remain in a torpid state du∣ring
the winter, and revive in the spring. The
hamster which we kept last winter (1762–3) in
an apartment without fire, and where the
cold frequently congealed water, never became
torpid, but moved about and eat its ordinary
food. But several kinds of dormice, which
were likewise in our possession, became torpid
in a much smaller degree of cold. Hence the
hamster neither approaches the dormice nor
marmot by this character; and some of our na∣turalists
have improperly called it the <HI>marmot of
Strasburg,</HI> though it sleeps not like the mar∣mot,
nor is found in the neighbourhood of Stras∣burg.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>In the <HI>Gazette de Littérature,</HI> of the 13th of
September 1774, we find the following observa∣tions
concerning the hamster, extracted from a
German publication by M. Sulzer.</P>
<P>“The corn-rat, in German <HI>hamster,</HI> cannot be
more commodiously described than at Gotha,
where, in one year, 11574 skins of it, in ano∣ther,
<PB N="187" REF="215"/>
54429, and, in a third, 80139, have been
brought to the town-house. In general, this
animal inhabits temperate countries. When
irritated, its heart beats 180 times in a minute.
The weight of the body is to that of the brain
as 1 to 193.”</P>
<P>“These animals lay up magazines which of∣ten
consist of twelve pounds of grain. In
winter, the female sinks very deep in the earth.
The male is a bold animal, and defends him∣self
against dogs, cats, and men. He is natu∣rally
quarrelsome, agrees not with his own
species, and sometimes, in a transport of fury,
slays his own family. He devours the feeble
individuals of his species, as well as mice and
birds; and yet he feeds upon all kinds of
herbs, fruits, and seeds. He drinks little; and
the female remains longer in her winter re∣treat
than the male. The former goes four
weeks with young, and often produces six at
a litter. In a few months, the females be∣come
fertile. The rat called <HI>Iltis</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Iltis</HI> is the polecat, and not a rat, as this author alledges.</NOTE> kills the
hamster.”</P>
<P>“When this animal is in a torpid state, nei∣ther
respiration, nor any kind of feeling, can
be perceived. The heart, however, beats fif∣teen
times in a minute, which is discovered by
opening the chest. The blood continues to be
fluid, and the intestines are not irritable. Even
<PB N="188" REF="216"/>
an electrical shock does not awake him: In
the open air, he is never reduced to a torpid
state.”</P>
<P>M. Sulzer mentions the gradual manner in
which this animal recovers his vigour and ac∣tivity.</P>
<P>“The utility of the hamster is confined to the
destruction of mice; but he himself is much
more mischievous<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Observat. sur le rat de blé, par M. Sulzer; <HI>Gazette de Littérature, 13 Sept.</HI> 1774.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>We wish that M. Sulzer had marked the pre∣cise
degree of cold, or want of air, which renders
these animals torpid; for we still maintain, what
was formerly remarked, that a hamster confined
in a cage, and in a room where water froze, was
not reduced to a torpid state during the winter
1763. This fact will receive additional confir∣mation
from the following observations of M.
Allamand, which he has published at the end of
the Dutch edition of my work.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Addition to the history of the HAMSTER, by
M. ALLAMAND.</HEAD>
<P>The hamster is a quadruped of the mouse
kind, which sleeps during the winter, like the
marmots. The legs and neck are short; the
head is thickish; and the mouth is garnished
<PB N="189" REF="217"/>
on each side with whiskers. The ears are large
and almost naked. The tail is short, and one
half of it naked. The eyes are round and pro∣minent.
The colour of the hair is a mixture of
red, yellow, white, and black. These characters
exhibit not the most alluring picture; and the
manners of the animal are still more disgusting.
He has no love but for himself, and possesses not
a single social quality. He attacks and devours
every animal he is capable of conquering, not
excepting his own species. Even the instinct
which draws him to the other sex, lasts only a
few hours; at the end of which the female would
not meet with a better fate, if she did not
take the precaution of avoiding, or of killing
him first. To these odious qualities, however,
Nature has joined others, which, without ren∣dering
him more amiable, make him deserve a
distinguished rank in the history of animals.
He belongs to the small number of those which
pass the winter in a torpid state, and he is the
only European animal that is provided with
cheek-pouches. His address in making a sub∣terraneous
abode, and the industry with which
he lays up provisions, merit the attention of the
curious.</P>
<P>The hamster inhabits not all soils or climates
indifferently. He is neither found in very warm
nor in very cold countries. As he lives upon
grains, and dwells under the earth, stony, sandy,
or argillaceous soils, are as inconvenient to him
<PB N="190" REF="218"/>
as meadows, forests, and marshy grounds. He
requires a soil which is easily pierced, and yet
so tenacious as not to tumble down. He like∣wise
chooses countries which abound in all kinds
of grain, that he may not be obliged to seek his
food at great distances, for which he is not well
qualified. In Thuringia, the soil of which pos∣sesses
all these qualities, the hamsters are more
numerous than in any other country.</P>
<P>The habitation, which the hamster digs to the
depth of three or four feet, consists of more or
fewer apartments, according to the age of the
animal. The principal chamber is lined with
straw, and serves him for a lodging. The others
are destined for the preservation of provisions,
of which he amasses great quantities during the
autumn. Each hole has two apertures; the
one descends obliquely, and the other, through
which the animal goes out and in, is perpendi∣cular.</P>
<P>The holes of the females, who never live with
the males, are somewhat different. In those
where she brings forth, there is seldom above
one chamber for provisions; because the short
time the young remain with her requires not a
great store of food. But, instead of one perpen∣dicular
hole, she makes seven or eight, to give
free passage to her young. Sometimes the mo∣ther
banishes her offspring, and continues to pos∣sess
this hole; but she commonly digs another,
<PB N="191" REF="219"/>
and lays up as much provisions as the season per∣mits
her to collect.</P>
<P>The hamsters copulate about the end of April,
when the males enter the apartments of the fe∣males,
where they remain only a few days. If
two males happen to meet in the same hole, a
furious combat ensues, which generally termi∣nates
in the death of the weakest. The con∣queror
takes possession of the female, and both,
though at every other period they persecute and
kill each other, lay aside their natural ferocity
during the few days their amours continue. They
even mutually defend each other against aggres∣sors.
When a hole is opened at this period, and
the female perceives that her husband is about
to be carried off, she darts upon the ravisher,
and makes him feel the fury of her vengeance,
by inflicting deep and painful wounds.</P>
<P>The females bring forth twice or thrice every
year. Their litter is never fewer than six, and
oftener from sixteen to eighteen. The growth
of these animals is very rapid. At the age of
fifteen days, they already begin to dig the earth.
Soon after, the mother banishes them from her
habitation: So that, at the age of about three
weeks, they are abandoned to their own ma∣nagement.
The mother, in general, discovers
little tenderness for her offspring. She who, in
the season of love, defends her husband with
courage, flies in the most dastardly manner when
her family is threatened with danger. Her
<PB N="192" REF="220"/>
only solicitude is to provide for her own safety.
With this view, when pursued, she digs deeper
into the earth, which she performs with an a∣mazing
quickness. The young would willing∣ly
follow her; but she is deaf to their cries, and
even shuts the hole which she had made.</P>
<P>The hamster feeds upon all kinds of herbs,
roots, and grains, which the different seasons
produce. He even eats the flesh of such ani∣mals
as he can conquer. As he is not adapted
for long journies, his magazine is first stocked
with the provisions which are nearest his abode.
This is the reason why some of his chambers are
frequently filled with one kind of grain only.
When the harvest is reaped, he goes to a great∣er
distance in quest of provisions, and carries
every article he can find, without distinction, to
his granary. To facilitate the transportation of
his food, Nature has furnished him with two
pouches in the inside of each cheek. On the
outside, these pouches are membranous, smooth,
and shining; and, in the inside, there are a great
many glands, which continually secrete a certain
fluid, to preserve their flexibility, and to enable
them to resist any accidents which may be occa∣sioned
by the roughness or sharpness of particu∣lar
grains. Each of these cheeks is capable of
containing an ounce and a half of grain, which,
on his return to his habitation, he empties, by
pressing his two fore feet against his cheeks.
When we meet a hamster having his cheeks filled
<PB N="193" REF="221"/>
with provisions, it is easy to seize him with the
hand, without the risk of being bitten; because, in
this condition, he has not the free motion of his
jaws. But, if he is allowed a little time, he soon
empties his pouches, and stands upon his de∣fence.
The quantity of provisions found in the
holes depends on the age and sex of the inha∣bitant.
The old hamsters often amass a hundred
pounds of grain; but the young and the females
content themselves with a quantity much smaller.
Their object in laying up provisions is not to
nourish them during the winter, which they pass
in sleep and without eating, but to support them
after they awake in the spring, and previous to
their falling into a torpid state.</P>
<P>At the approach of winter, the hamsters re∣tire
into their subterraneous abodes; the entry
to which they shut up with great address. There
they remain in perfect tranquillity, and feed on
their provisions, till the frost becomes severe,
when they sink into a torpid state, which resem∣bles
a profound sleep. When, during this pe∣riod,
the holes are opened, which we know by
a small eminence of earth raised near the oblique
passage formerly described, we find the hamster
lying upon a bed of soft straw. His head is
bended under his belly, between the two fore
legs, and those behind rest upon his muzzle.
The eyes are shut; and, when the eye-lids are
forced open, they instantly close again. The
members are stiff, like those of a dead animal,
<PB N="194" REF="222"/>
and the whole body feels as cold as ice. Nei∣ther
respiration nor any other sign of life can be
perceived. When dissected in this situation, we
see the heart alternately contracting and dilating.
But this movement is so slow, that the pulsations
exceed not fifteen in a minute; though, when
the animal is awake, the heart beats a hundred
and fifty strokes during the same time. The fat
has the appearance of being coagulated. The
intestines are as cold as the external parts of the
body, and discover not the smallest irritability
upon the application of spirit of wine or oil of
vitriol. During this operation, the animal seems
to feel very little. He sometimes opens his
mouth, as if he wanted to respire. But his le∣thargy
is too strong to admit of his wakening
entirely.</P>
<P>The lethargy of the hamster has been ascribed
solely to a certain degree of cold: This may be
true with regard to the dormice and bats. But
experience proves, that, in order to render the
hamster torpid, he must also be excluded from
all communication with the external air: For,
when a hamster is shut up in a cage filled with
earth and straw, and exposed in winter to a de∣gree
of cold sufficient to freeze water, he never
becomes torpid. But, when the cage is sunk
four or five feet under ground, and well secured
against the access of air, at the end of eight or
ten days he is equally torpid as if he had been
in his own burrow. If the cage is brought up
<PB N="195" REF="223"/>
to the surface, the hamster will awake in a few
hours, and resume his torpid state when put be∣low
the earth. This experiment may be repeat∣ed
with the same success, as long as the frost
continues. We have a farther proof that the
absence of the air is one of the causes of torpid∣ness
in the hamster: When brought up from his
hole, in the coldest weather, and exposed to the
air, he infallibly awakes in a few hours. This
experiment succeeds equally either in the night
or day, which proves that the light forms no
part of the cause.</P>
<P>It is curious to observe the hamster passing
from a torpid to an active state. He first loses
the rigidity of his members, and then makes a
profound respiration, but at long intervals. His
legs begin to move, he opens his mouth, and
utters disagreeable and rattling sounds. After
continuing these operations for some time, he o∣pens
his eyes, and endeavours to raise himself
on his legs. But all these movements are still
reeling and unsteady, like those of a man intox∣icated
with liquor. He, however, reiterates his
efforts, till he is enabled to stand on his legs. In
this attitude he remains fixed, as if he meant
to reconnoitre, and repose himself after his fa∣tigues.
But he gradually begins to walk, to eat,
and to act in his usual manner. This passage
from a torpid to an active state, requires more or
less time, according to the temperature of the
air. When exposed to a cold air, he sometimes
<PB N="196" REF="224"/>
requires more than two hours to awake, and, in
a more temperate air, he accomplishes his pur∣pose
in less than one hour. It is probable that
this change is produced imperceptibly, when the
animal is in his hole, and that he feels none of
the inconveniencies which arise from a sudden
and forced reviviscence.</P>
<P>The life of a hamster is divided between the
necessary cares of satisfying his natural appetites,
and the fury of combating. He seems to have
no other passion but that of rage, which indu∣ces
him to attack every animal that comes in his
way, without attending to the superior strength
of the enemy. Ignorant of the art of saving
himself by flight, rather than yield, he allows
himself to be beat to pieces with a stick. If he
seizes a man's hand, he must be killed before he
quits his hold. The magnitude of the horse ter∣rifies
him as little as the address of the dog,
which last is fond of hunting him. When the
hamster perceives the dog at a distance, he be∣gins
with emptying his cheek-pouches, if they
happen to be filled with grain. He then blows
them up so prodigiously, that the size of the
head and neck greatly exceeds that of the rest of
the body. In fine, he raises himself on his hind
legs, and, in this attitude, darts upon the enemy.
If he catches hold, he never quits it but with
the loss of his life. But the dog generally seizes
him behind, and strangles him. This ferocious
temper prevents the hamster from being at peace
<PB REF="225"/>
<FIGURE>
<P>Plate CCXX.</P>
<P>HAMSTER.</P>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="197" REF="226"/>
with any other animal. He even makes war
against his own species, not excepting the fe∣males.
When two hamsters rencounter, they
never fail to attack each other, and the stronger
always devours the weaker. A combat between
a male and a female commonly lasts longer than
between two males. They begin by pursuing
and biting each other; then each of them retire
to a side, as if to take breath; a little after, they
renew the combat, and continue to fly and to
fight till one of them falls. The vanquished u∣niformly
serves for a repast to the conqueror.</P>

<P>THE Hamster has been called the <HI>Stras∣bourg
Marmot,</HI> and the bobak the <HI>Polish</HI>
marmot. But it is equally certain that the ham∣ster
is not a marmot, as it is probable that the
bobak does belong to that species; for the bobak
differs from the Alpine marmot only in the co∣lour
of his hair, which, instead of brown, is a
pale yellow. He has also a thumb, or rather a
claw on the fore-feet; while the marmot has only
four toes and no thumb. In every other article,
the resemblance is perfect; from which it is to
be presumed, that these two animals are not di∣stinct
species. The same observation applies to
the <HI>monax,</HI> or <HI>marmot of Canada,</HI> which by some
travellers has been called the <HI>whistler.</HI> He
seems to differ from the marmot only by the
tail, which is longer, and more bushy. Hence
the monax of Canada, the bobak of Poland, and
the Alpine marmot, appear to be the same ani∣mal,
which, from the influence of different cli∣mates,
<PB N="199" REF="228"/>
have undergone the varieties formerly men∣tioned.
As this species prefers the coldest and
most mountainous regions, and as it is found in
Poland, Russia, and other parts of the North of
Europe, it is not surprising that it should like∣wise
be found in Canada, where it is only smaller<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Alpine and Polish marmots are a foot and a half long from the extremity of the muzzle to the origin of the tail; but the monax, or Canadian marmot, exceeds not fourteen or fifteen inches in length.</NOTE>.
Neither is this circumstance peculiar to the mar∣mot;
for all the animals common to both Con∣tinents
are smaller in the New than in the Old
World.</P>
<P>The Siberian animal, which the Russians call
<HI>Jevraschka,</HI> is a species of marmot still smaller
than the Canadian monax. It has a round head
and a blunt nose. It has no external ears, and
the auditory passages can only be discovered by
removing the hair. The length of the body,
including the head, exceeds not a foot; and the
tail, which is round near the body, then flat,
and truncated at the extremity, is but three
inches long. The body of this animal is pretty
thick, the hair is yellow, mixed with gray, and
that on the end of the tail is almost black. The
legs are short, those before being somewhat
longer than those behind. The hind feet have
five toes and five black claws, which are a little
crooked; and the fore feet have only four.
When these animals are irritated, or attempted
<PB N="200" REF="229"/>
to be seized, they bite violently, and set up a
sharp cry like the marmot. When they eat,
they sit on their buttocks, and carry the victuals
to their mouths with the fore paws. They come
in season in spring, and bring forth in summer.
The litter is generally five or six. They dig
holes in the earth, where they pass the winter,
and where the female brings forth and suckles
her young. Though they have a great resem∣blance
to the marmot, yet they appear to be of
a different species; for, in the same parts of Si∣beria,
there are genuine Polish or Alpine mar∣mots,

<HEAD>THE JERBOAS.</HEAD>
<P>JERBOA is a generic name employed to de∣note
those animals which are remarkable for
the disproportion between the hind and fore legs,
the latter not exceeding the length of a mole's
paws, and the former resembling the legs of a
bird. In this genus, we are acquainted with
four species, or distinct varieties: 1. The Tar∣sier,
or woolly Jerboa, formerly mentioned,
which is certainly a particular species, because it
has five toes on each foot, like those of a mon∣key.
2. The Jerboa, properly so called<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Egyptian Jerboa, with thin, erect, and broad ears, full and dark eyes, and long whiskers. The fore legs are an inch long, with five toes on each, the inner, or thumb, being scarce apparent; but that, as well as the rest, furnished with a sharp claw. The hind legs are two inches and a quarter long, thinly covered with hair, and exactly resembling those of a bird; three toes on each foot, covered above and below with hair: The middle toe is the longest, and on each is a pretty long sharp claw. The length, from nose to tail, is se∣ven inches and one quarter; the tail ten inches, terminated with a thick black tuft of hair; the tip white. The rest of the tail is covered with very short coarse hair. The upper part of the body is thin, or compressed sidewise. The part a∣bout the rump and loins is large. The head, back, sides, and thighs, are covered with long hair, ash coloured at the bot∣tom, and pale tawny at the ends. The breast and belly are whitish, and the hair long and soft; <HI>Pennant's Synops. of quad. p.</HI> 295.</P>

<P>The head of the jerboa has a great resem∣blance

in proportion to its size. The nose is flesh-co∣loured

short. The opening of the mouth is very small;
the upper jaw is very broad, and the under nar∣row
and short. The teeth are like those of the
rabbit, and the whiskers round the mouth are
composed of long black and white hairs. The
fore feet are extremely short, and never touch
the ground, being used only as hands to convey
victuals to the mouth. These hands have four
fingers, armed with claws, and the rudiments of
a fifth without any claw. The hind feet have

only three toes, the middle of which is longest,
and all three are armed with claws. The tail is
three times longer than the body; it is covered
with small stiff hairs, of the same colour with
those on the back, and the extremity of it is
garnished with longer, softer, and more bushy
hair. The legs are naked and flesh-coloured, as
well as the nose and ears. The top of the head
and back are covered with reddish hair, and the
flanks, the under part of the head, the throat, the
belly, and the inside of the thighs, are white:

<P>The alagtaga is smaller than a rabbit. His ears
are long, broad, naked, thin, transparent, and

<P>From comparing these two descriptions, the
first of which is taken from Edwards and Has∣selquist,
and the second from Gmelin, it appears
that the jerboa and alagtaga resemble each other
in a striking manner. The jerboa is only smal∣ler
then the alagtaga, and has but four toes on
the fore feet, and three on the hind, without a∣ny
spur; while the alagtaga has five toes on the
fore feet, and three and a spur on the hind feet.
But I suspect that this difference is not constant;
for Dr Shaw, who has given a figure and de∣scription
of a Barbary jerboa, represents it with
<PB N="206" REF="236"/>
a spur or fourth toe on the hind feet; and Mr
Edwards remarks, that he carefully examined
two jerboas which he saw in England, and could
discover no spur. Hence this character, which
might serve as a specific distinction between the
jerboa and alagtaga, by not being constant, an∣swers
no purpose, but marks rather the identity
than the diversity of the species. Neither does
the difference in size prove them to be distinct
species: Edwards and Hasselquist may have de∣scribed
only young jerboas, and Gmelin an old
alagtaga.</P>
<P>Two circumstances, however, render this
matter still doubtful; the proportion of the tail,
which is much larger in the jerboa than in the
alagtaga, and the difference of the climates which
they inhabit. The jerboa is common in Circas∣sia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Circassia, Persia, Arabia, and the environs of Babylon, there is a kind of field-mouse, called <HI>jerbuach</HI> in the Arabic language, which is nearly of the size and colour of the squir∣rel.—When it leaps, it darts five or six feet above the ground.—It sometimes quits the fields, and takes up its abode in the houses; <HI>Voyage d'Olearius, p.</HI> 177.</NOTE>,
Egypt<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In Egypt, I saw two small animals, that ran very quickly on their hind feet, which were so long that the creatures seem∣ed to be mounted on stilts. These animals burrow like rab∣bits. I carried off seven of them; two of which I brought to France, where they lived in the royal menagerie two years; <HI>Voyage de Paul Lucas, tom. 2. p.</HI> 74.</NOTE>, Barbary, and Arabia; and the a∣lagtaga
in Tartary, along the Wolga, and as far
as Siberia. It is seldom that the same animal
inhabits climates so different; and, when it does
<PB N="207" REF="237"/>
happen, the species undergoes great changes:
This we presume to be the case with the jerboa,
of which, notwithstanding these differences, the
alagtaga seems to be only a variety.</P>
<P>These animals generally conceal their hands
or fore feet among the hair; so that, at first sight,
they seem to have only two feet. In transport∣ing
themselves from place to place, they do not
walk, or advance one foot after another, but
leap nimbly to the distance of three or four feet.
When reposing themselves, they sit on their
knees, and sleep only during the day. They
eat grain and herbage, like the hare. Their dis∣positions
are mild, and yet they can never be
tamed beyond a certain point. They dig holes
in the earth like the rabbits, and in a much
shorter time. About the end of summer, they
lay up herbage in their magazines, where, in
cold countries, they pass the winter.</P>
<P>As we have had no opportunity of dissecting
this animal, we shall subjoin the remarks of M.
Gmelin upon its internal structure<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Oesophagus, uti in lepore et cuniculo, medio ventriculo inseritur; intestinum caecum breve admodum sed amplum est, in processum vermiformem, duos pollices longum abiens.

With regard to the daman, or lamb of the
children of Israel, which seems to be a kind of
jerboa, because its fore legs are remarkably short∣er
than the hind, having never seen this animal,
we cannot do better than copy the remarks of
Dr Shaw, who had an opportunity of comparing
it with the jerboa, and speaks of them as two
distinct species. “The daman,” says this au∣thor,
“is likewise an animal of Mount Libanus,
though common in other places of this coun∣try.
It is a harmless creature, of the same
size and quality with the rabbit; and with the
like incurvating posture and disposition of the
fore teeth. But it is of a browner colour, with
smaller eyes, and a head more pointed, like the
marmots. The fore feet likewise are short, and
the hinder are nearly as long in proportion as
those of the jerboa. Though this animal is
known to burrow sometimes in the ground;
yet, as its usual residence and refuge is in the
holes and clifts of the rocks, we have so far a
more presumptive proof, that this creature may
be the saphan of the Scriptures, than the jerboa.
I could not learn why it was called daman Is∣rael,
<PB N="209" REF="239"/>
<HI>i. e.</HI> Israel's lamb, as those words are in∣terpreted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shaw's travels, p. 248.</NOTE>.”
Prosper Alpinus, who mentioned
this animal before Dr Shaw, says, that its flesh
makes excellent eating, and that it is larger than
the European rabbit. But this last fact seems
to be suspicious; for Dr Shaw has omitted this
passage of Prosper Alpinus, though he transcribes
all the other remarks of that author.</P>

<P>Naturalists have imagined that there are dif∣ferent

they are often reared in houses, and must, like

will be easily persuaded, that the diversities in
colour and size are only simple varieties, and
are not sufficient to constitute distinct species;
especially as, in two ichneumons which I saw
alive, and in several stuffed skins, I examined the
intermediate shades both of colour and size, and
remarked, that not one of them differed from
the others by any evident and constant character.
It only appears, that, in Egypt, where the ich∣neumons
are in a manner domestic, they are
larger than in India, where they are wild<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This ichneumon, says Edwards, came from the East Indies, and was very small.

Beside the size, the only other difference between these two ichneumons was, that the Egyptian kind had a small tuft at the extremity of the tail, while that of the Indian kind terminated in a point. I believe they are two distinct species; because that of India, which was comparatively so small, had acquired its full growth; <HI>Edwards, p. 199. Nota.</HI> These differences are not sufficient to constitute two species, especially as between the largest and smallest, that is, from thirteen to twenty-two inches in length, there are intermediate sizes of fifteen and sixteen inches.

Besides, I saw one of these small ichneumons, which was so tame, that its master (M. le President de Robien) carried it always in his hat, and exhibited to the whole world the mildness and good nature of this animal.</NOTE>.</P>

made it a badger. Klein and Brisson have pla∣ced

arbitrary, and equivocal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hasselquist finishes his long, dry, and uninteresting de∣scription of the ichneumon with these words: `Galli, in Egypto conversantes, qui omnibus rebus quas non cognoscunt, sua imponunt nomina ficta, appellarunt hoc animal <HI>rat de Pha∣raon.</HI> Quod sequuti qui Latine relationes de Egypto dederunt, <HI>Al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in, Belon,</HI> murem Pharaonis effinxerunt.” If this man had read Belon and Alpinus, whom he quotes, he would have per∣ceived that it was not the French who gave the appellation of <HI>Pharaoh's rat</HI> to the ichneumon, but the Egyptians themselves, and would not, on that account, have taken occasion to re∣vile our nation. But it is not surprising to find petulance and pedantry in the works of a school-boy. In a word, his de∣scriptions of the ichneumon, of the cameleopard, and of some other animals, can never serve any other purpose than to mis∣lead those who take the disagreeable and irksome trouble of reading them: 1. Because they are unaccompanied with fi∣gures, which a multitude of ill chosen words can never sup∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y: 2. Because these words are mostly barbarous Latin, or rather no language whatever: 3. Because the method obser∣ved in descriptions of this kind, is only a rote, which every man can follow, and requires neither genius nor knowledge: 4. Because, by the minuteness of the description, the remark∣able and distinctive characters of the animal described are confounded with the more obscure, unimportant, and equi∣vocal marks: 5. In fine, because the numerous relations, and precarious combinations, with which we are obliged to load the memory, render the labour of the reader greater than that of the author, and leave both as ignorant as they were before. What proves that, in rotes of this nature, neither reading nor knowledge are necessary, is, 1. The false imputation thrown on the French nation with regard to <HI>Pharaoh's rat;</HI> 2. The blunder he commits in ascribing to this animal the Arabian name <HI>Nems,</HI> which signifies the ferret, and not the ichneumon. To avoid this error, an acquaintance with the Arabic language was unnecessary; it was enough to have read the travels of those who had gone before him in the same country; 3. The omission of essential characters, while he enlarges with∣out measure upon those which are indifferent. He describes, for example, the cameleopard as minutely as the ichneumon; but he omits the most important character, namely, whether the horns are permanent, or fall off annually: Among a thousand useless words, we find not the one which is most ne∣cessary, and, from his description, we cannot discover whether the cameleopard belongs to the stag or ox kind. But we have dwelt too long on a criticism which every man of sense must make, when works of this nature fall into his hands.</NOTE>.</P>

The ichneumon loves the banks of rivers.
During inundations, he retires to the high
grounds, and often approaches the habitations
of men in quest of prey. In walking, he makes
no noise, and varies his gait according to circum∣stances.
Sometimes he carries his head high,
contracts his body, and raises himself on his
limbs. At other times, he has the air of creep∣ing
and of lengthening his body like a serpent.
He often sits on his hind legs; and still more
<PB N="216" REF="246"/>
frequently darts like an arrow on his prey. His
eyes are vivacious and full of fire. His aspect
is beautiful, his body very agile, his limbs short,
his tail thick and very long, and his hair rude,
and often curled. Both male and female<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The inhabitants of Alexandria rear an animal called <HI>ichneumen,</HI> which is a native of Egypt.

<P>BY some travellers the fossane is called the
<HI>Genet of Madagascar,</HI> because it resem∣bles
the genet in colour, and some other articles.
But it is constantly smaller, and has not the o∣doriferous
pouch, which is an essential charac∣ter
of the genet. As we were uncertain as to
this fact, we wrote to M. Poivre, who had sent
us a stuffed skin, and who obliged us with the
following answers: “Lyon, July 19. 1761.
The fossane which I brought from Madagas∣car
had the manners of our martin. The in∣ha∣bitants
of the island assured me, that the
genitals of the male, when in season, had a
strong odour of musk. When the skin was
stuffed at the royal garden, I examined it at∣tentively,
and could perceive no pouch or
smell of musk. I reared a similar animal in
Cochinchina, and another in the Philippine
islands. Both of them were males, and they
<PB N="220" REF="251"/>
became a little familiar. They were very
young, and I kept them only two or three
months. I found no pouch in the part you
mentioned; and I only perceived that their
excrements had an odour similar to those of
our martin. They eat flesh and fruits; but
they preferred the latter, and showed a deci∣ded
taste for bananas, upon which they sprung
with avidity. This animal is very wild,
and difficult to tame. Though taken when
young, his air and character were always fe∣rocious,
which seemed to be uncommon in
an animal that feeds spontaneously on fruits.
The eye of the fossane is a large black globe,
which gives it a mischievous aspect.”</P>
<P>We rejoice in this opportunity of expressing
our gratitude to M. Poivre, who, from his at∣tachment
to natural history, and his friendship
to those who cultivate that science, has adorn∣ed
the royal cabinet with a great number of rare
and valuable articles.</P>
<P>It appears to us, that the animal called <HI>Berbé</HI>
in Guiney, is the same with the fossane, and,
consequently, that this species exists in Africa
as well as in Asia. “The berbé has a sharper
muzzle and a smaller body than the cat; and

<P>THOSE who mention this animal have ta∣ken

<P>The vansire, as formerly remarked, is a native
of Madagascar and the interior parts of Africa.
It has a great resemblance to the ferret, except in
the number and form of the teeth, and in the tail▪
which is much longer in the vansire than in our
ferret. We here give the figure of an animal
which was transmitted to us from the Eastern
part of Africa, under the denomination of <HI>Neipse.</HI>
From its figure as well as its name, I know it to
be a species of ferret; for <HI>nems</HI> or <HI>nims</HI> is the
name of the ferret in the Arabic language. These
Arabian ferrets, or <HI>nems,</HI> have a greater resem∣blance
to the vansire than to our European ferrets.
M. de Séve gives the following description of the
<HI>nems.</HI></P>
<P>“The <HI>nems,</HI> from his figure and flexibility, is
a genuine ferret. When he walks, he lengthens
his body, and appears to have very short legs.
The individual under consideration was a male,
and about thirteen inches and a half long from
the muzzle to the anus, and the length of the
tail one foot. The fore part of the body is
five inches and a half high, and the hind part
six inches and a half. The ears are naked,
and of the same figure with those of the com∣mon
ferret. The eye is vivacious, and the co∣lour
<PB N="222" REF="255"/>
of the iris a deep yellow. The muzzle,
which is very sharp, appeared not to have any
whiskers. The whole body is covered with
long hair, which is a mixture of dark brown
and a dirty white, and gives it a resemblance
to the silvery rabbit. The hair on the belly is
of a bright yellow colour, without any mix∣ture.
The ground colour on the head, and
round the eyes, is clear and yellowish: On the
nose, cheeks, and other parts of the face where
the hair is short, a tincture of brown, more or
less deep, prevails without mixture, and gra∣dually
loses itself above the eyes. The legs
are covered with short hair, of a deep yellow
colour. On the paws there are four toes, and
a small one behind. The claws are small and
black. The tail, which is more than double
the length of that of our ferrets, is very thick
at its origin, terminates in a point, and is co∣vered
with hair similar to that on the body.
This animal, according to the information of
the boy who has the charge of it, never drinks.”

<P>AS the name <HI>maki</HI> has been given to several
animals, we could only employ it as a ge∣neric
term, under which we shall comprehend
three animals of the same genus, but of distinct

and feet like those of the monkey; but their
muzzle is long, like that of the martin, and they

applied; for, besides the pied variety, some in∣dividuals
are entirely black, and others entirely
white. These animals are all natives of the
Eastern regions of Africa, and particularly of
Madagascar, where they are very numerous.</P>
<P>The Maucauco is a beautiful animal. His
aspect is agreeable, his figure elegant, and his
hair always neat and glossy. He is remarkable
for the largeness of his eyes, the height of his
hind legs, which are much longer than those be∣fore,
and his large and handsome tail, which is
always erected, always in motion, and garnish∣ed
with thirty alternate rings of black and white,
well marked and separated from each other. His
manners are gentle, and, though he has a great
resemblance to the monkeys, he possesses none
of their malicious dispositions. In a state of li∣berty,
the maucauco's live in society, and they
are found in Madagascar in troops of thirty or
forty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The vari's, whose tails are barred with black and white, go in troops of thirty, forty, or fifty: They resemble the va∣ricossi's; <HI>Voyage de Flacourt, p.</HI> 154.</NOTE>. In a domestic state, the prodigious ra∣pidity
of their movements renders them incom∣modious:
It is for this reason alone that they
are generally chained; for, though extremely
<PB N="226" REF="263"/>
active and vivacious, they are neither mischie∣vous
nor ferocious. They tame to such a de∣gree
as to go out and return, without any dan∣ger
of running off. Their gait is oblique, like
that of all animals which have hands instead of
feet. The maucauco leaps more gracefully than
he walks. He is a silent animal, uttering only
a short acute cry when surprised or irritated. He
sleeps in a sitting posture, with his muzzle rest∣ing
on his breast. His body is not thicker than
that of a cat, but it is longer; and the height of
his legs gives him the appearance of being larger
than he really is. His hair, though very soft to
the touch, stands always erect. In the male
maucauco, the organs of generation are small
and concealed; but those of the mongous, or
woolly maucauco, are disproportionally large, and
very apparent.</P>
<P>The mongous is smaller than the maucauco;
his hair is likewise silky, pretty short, and some∣what
curled. His nose is larger than that of the
maucauco, and resembles that of the vari. I had
a mongous in my possession for several years,
which was altogether brown. It had yellow
eyes, a black nose, and short ears. It amused
itself with eating its own tail, and actually de∣stroyed
the last four or five vertebrae. This a∣nimal
was extremely dirty, and so troublesome
that we were obliged to chain him. Whenever
he could make his escape, he went into the
neighbouring shops in quest of fruits, sugar, and
<PB N="227" REF="264"/>
sweetmeats, and opened the boxes which con∣tained
them. It was difficult to seize him, and
he bit cruelly even those with whom he was best
acquainted. He uttered a low grunting noise,
almost perpetually; and, when tired of being
alone, he croaked like a frog, and so loud as to
be heard at a great distance. This mongous
was a male, and his testicles were extremely large
in proportion to the size of his body. He was
fond of the she-cats, and even satisfied his desires,
without any intimate union: His embraces
were, of course, ineffectual. He dreaded cold
and moisture; he never departed from the fire,
and stood on end to warm himself. He was fed
with bread and fruits. His tongue was rough,
like that of a cat; and, when permitted, he lick∣ed
a person's hand till it was inflamed, and of∣ten
finished this operation with a severe bite.
The cold of the winter 1750 killed him, though
he never quitted his station near the fire. His
movements were extremely brisk, and sometimes
petulant. He often slept during the day; but
his slumbers were so light, that the smallest noise
awaked him.</P>
<P>In this species there are several varieties, both
in colour and size: The mongous, whose histo∣ry
has just now been given, was totally brown,
and about the size of an ordinary cat. I saw
one, which, though an adult, was not larger than
the fat squirrel. If this small mongous had not
perfectly resembled the large kind, except in size,
<PB N="228" REF="265"/>
it would unquestionably have been a distinct
species. But, as we have no evidence that these
two animals do not intermix, we must still re∣gard
them as the same species, till we acquire
some new light as to their history and oecono∣my.</P>
<P>The vari<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Flacourt, who calls the maucauco <HI>vari,</HI> gives the name of <HI>varicossy</HI> to this animal; which epithet, probably, denotes the greater size and ferocity of the animal, who likewise differs from the maucauco in several other articles.</NOTE> is larger, stronger, and more fero∣cious
than the maucauco. In a state of liberty,
he is even dangerous. We are told by travellers,
“That these animals are as furious as tigers;
that they make such a noise in the woods, that,
when only two of them are together, one would
believe there were a hundred; and that it is
difficult to tame them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Flacourt, p. 153.—When this animal is taken young, he apparently loses his ferocity, and seems to be as gentle as the maucauco. “It is an animal of a social, mild, and peaceable nature, and has neither the cunning nor the malice of the monkey;” <HI>Edw. Gleanings, p.</HI> 13.</NOTE>.” The voice of the
vari has some resemblance to the roaring of a
lion, and is tremendous to those who hear it for
the first time. This astonishing strength of
voice, in a middle sized animal, depends on the
singular structure of its wind-pipe, the two
branches of which widen, and form a large cavi∣ty,
before they enter the lungs. Hence he dif∣fers
from the maucauco both in structure and

he has a kind of a ruff or cravat of still longer
hair, which surrounds his neck, and forms a very
distinct character by which he is easily known.
In colour, he varies from white to black, or pied;
and his hair, though long and very soft, stands
almost perpendicular to the skin. His muzzle
is larger and proportionally longer than that of
the maucauco. His ears are much shorter, and
fringed with long hairs. His eyes are of so
deep an orange colour, that they appear to be
red.</P>

In this manner they sleep, like the squirrels, upon the branches of trees. Be∣sides, they have round ears, and a muzzle like the martin. This species is not so troublesome and malicious as the other kinds. The antavarres have the same kind of hair with the former, and a white ruff round the neck.

monkeys and the digitated quadrupeds.
Like the monkeys, they have four hands and a
long tail; and, at the same time, their muzzle
is long like that of the fox or pole-cat. In
manners, however, they have a greater resem∣blance
to the monkeys; for, though they some∣times
eat flesh, and likewise lie in wait for birds,
they are more frugivorous than carnivorous, and
prefer, even in a domestic state, fruits, roots,
and bread, to flesh, either raw or roasted.

<P>THE Loris is a small animal of Ceylon,
which is very remarkable for the elegance
of its figure, and the singularity of its conforma∣tion.
Of all animals, its body is, perhaps, the
longest in proportion to its bulk. It has nine
lumbar vertebrae, whilst all other quadrupeds
<PB N="232" REF="272"/>
have only five, six, or seven. The length of
its body is an effect of this structure; and it ap∣pears
still longer, because it wants a tail. Were
it not for this defect of tail, and the uncommon
number of vertebrae, it might be comprehended
under the list of makis; for it resembles them
in the hands and feet, in the quality of the hair,
in the number of teeth, and in the pointed
muzzle. But, independent of the singularity above
taken notice of, which removes this animal from
the makis, he has other peculiar qualities. His
head is entirely round, and his muzzle is almost
perpendicular to this sphere. His eyes are ex∣ceedingly
large, and very near each other. His
ears are large, rounded, and garnished in the
inside with three auricles, in the form of a small
shell. But, what is still more remarkable, and
perhaps peculiar to this animal, the female dis∣charges
her urine by the clitoris, which is per∣forated
like the penis of the male; and these
two organs have a perfect resemblance to each
other, both in figure and size.</P>
<P>Linnaeus has given a short, but excellent de∣scription
of this animal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Statura sciuri, subferruginea, linea dorsali subfusca; gula albidiore, linea longitudinalis oculis interjecta alba.

apes which had been brought from Cey∣lon.
They were much esteemed, because they
exceeded not the size of a man's hand, and
were of an uncommon species. Their front
was flat, their eyes large and round, and of a
bright yellow colour, like those of certain
cats. Their muzzle is very sharp, and the
inside of their ears is yellow. They have no
tail...... When I examined them, they
stood on their hind feet, often embraced each

<P>OF the various bats which were unknown,
we denominated some by names derived
from foreign languages, and others by appella∣tions
drawn from their most striking characters.
The animal now under consideration we have
called the <HI>javelin bat,</HI> because it has a mem∣brane
on its nose nearly of the shape of an an∣tient
javelin or spear. Though this character be
sufficient to distinguish it from all other bats,
we may add, that it has almost not tail; that it
is nearly of the same colour and size with the
<PB N="235" REF="276"/>
common bat; but that, instead of having six
cutting teeth in the under jaw, like most of the
other species, it has only four. This bat, which
is very common in America, does not exist in
Europe.</P>
<P>In Senegal, there is another bat with a mem∣brane
on its nose; but this membrane, instead
of resembling a javelin, or a horse shoe, as in
this and a former species, has the figure of an
oval leaf. These three bats, as they belong to
different climates, are not simple varieties, but
distinct species. M. Daubenton has described
this bat under the name of the <HI>leaf bat,</HI> in the
<HI>Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences, ann.</HI> 1759,
<HI>p.</HI> 374.</P>
<P>The bats, which are already greatly allied to
the birds by their flying, their wings, and the
strength of their pectoral muscles, seem to make
a still nearer approach by these crests or mem∣branes
on their face. These redundant parts,
which, at first sight, appear to be superfluous
deformities, are the real characters, the visible
shades, by which Nature has connected these
flying quadrupeds to the birds; for most of the
latter have membranes and crests round their
bills and heads, which seem to be equally super∣fluous
with those of the bats.</P>
<DIV3>
<PB N="236" REF="277"/>
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>M. Pallas, who sent us descriptions of two
new bats, the figures of which we now give,
informs us, that the javelin bat, formerly descri∣bed,
should not be confounded with the bat de∣scribed
by Seba under the appellation of the
common American bat. M. Pallas, after com∣paring
the two, assures us, that they are very
different species. Our acknowledgments are due
to M. Pallas for pointing out this mistake.</P>
<P>He then gives a description of one of these
new bats, which is a native of India. He calls
it <HI>cephalote,</HI> because its head is very large in pro∣portion
to its body. The neck is also more di∣stinct,
because it is not so thickly covered with
hair. The following is an extract from M.
Pallas's description.</P>
<P>“This bat, hitherto unknown to the Natu∣ralists,
is found in the Molucca islands, from
which two females were sent to M. Schlosser
at Amsterdam. The female seems to produce
but one young. This conjecture is founded
on M. Pallas's dissection of one of these fe∣males,
in which he found one foetus only.”</P>
<P>“This bat,” continues M. Pallas, “differs from
all others in the teeth, which have some re∣semblance
to those of the mouse, or even of
<PB N="237" REF="278"/>
the hedge-hog, and appear to be rather desti∣ned
for cutting fruits than for devouring prey.
The canine teeth of the upper jaw are sepa∣rated
by two small teeth. In the under jaw,
these small teeth are wanting, and the two
canine teeth of the same jaw are like the cut∣ting
teeth of a mouse.”</P>
<P>I shall here add a table of the number and
arrangement of the teeth in the bat-kind, com∣municated
to me by M. Daubenton; from which
it will appear, that the cephalotte, and the <HI>shrew
bat,</HI> to be afterwards taken notice of, are new
species discovered by M. Pallas.</P>

“The tail of the cephalotte bat,” says M. Pal∣las,
“is not long, and is situated under the
membrane between the two thighs. The fi∣gure
of the nostrils distinguishes it from every
other bat. The form of the pupil likewise
differs from that of every other bat. The
breast is broad, and has a greater resemblance
to the breast of a bird than any other species.
This animal is about 3 ¾ inches long, and its
wings extends above a foot in length.”</P>
<P>The second species of bats described by M.
Pallas under the denomination of <HI>vespertilio so∣ricinus,</HI>
or shrew bat, has no tail, and carries a
leaf or membrane on its nose. It is the smal∣lest
of those kinds which want the tail, being
only about two inches long. It is equally com∣mon
in the warmest regions of America, the
Caribbee islands, and Surinam. Its figure seems
to be given by Edwards, <HI>plate 201. fig.</HI> 1. The
muzzle of this bat is longer, and more slender
than in the other kinds. The tongue is re∣markable
both for its length and structure. The
male and female hardly differ but in the organs
of generation.

<P>Voyage du Père F. Vincent-Marie de Sainte-Catharine de Sienne, p. 409.</P></NOTE>, or MOUN∣TAIN
CAT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS animal, which lived several years in
the royal menagerie, appears to be the
same with that described by the gentlemen of
the academy under the name of <HI>chat-pard;</HI> and
we should, perhaps, have been still ignorant of
its real name, if the Marquis de Montmirail had
not discovered it in an Italian book, of which
he sent us the following passage in our own lan∣guage:
“The <HI>Maraputé,”</HI> says P. Vincent-Marie,
which the Portuguese in India call <HI>Serval,</HI> is a
ferocious animal, larger than a wild cat, and
somewhat less than the civet; from which last
he differs, by having a rounder and larger
head, and a kind of depression on the middle
of the front. He resembles the panther in the
colour of his hair, which is yellow on the head,
back, and flanks, and white on the belly; and
likewise in the spots, which are distinct, equal∣ly
distributed, and a little smaller than those
of the panther. His eyes are extremely bril∣liant.
<PB N="241" REF="288"/>
His whiskers are long and stiff; his
tail is short; and his feet are armed with long
hooked claws. He inhabits the mountains of
India. He is seldom seen on the ground, but
remains always on the trees, where he makes
his nest, and seizes birds, which constitute his
chief nourishment. He leaps from tree to
tree as nimbly as a monkey, and with such ad∣dress
and agility, that he runs through a con∣siderable
space in an instant, and may be said
only to appear and disappear. He is extreme∣ly
fierce, and yet he flies the aspect of man,
unless when provoked, and particularly when
his dwelling is injured: He then becomes fu∣rious,
darts upon the offender, and bites and
tears nearly in the same manner as the pan∣ther.”</P>
<P>Neither captivity, nor good or bad treatment,
can soften the ferocity of this animal. The one
we saw at the menagerie was always prepared
to dart upon those who approached him; and
we were obliged to draw and describe him
through the grate of his apartment. He was
fed with flesh, like the panthers and leopards.</P>
<P>This serval or maraputa of Malabar and In∣dia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At Sagari, an island in the Ganges, there are tiger-cats as large as a wedder; <HI>Nouv-voyage par le Sieur Luillier, p.</HI> 90.</NOTE>,
appeared to be the same animal with the
tiger-cat of Senegal and the Cape of Good Hope,
which, according to the testimony of travellers<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Le Maire, p. 100.—The wood-cat or tiger-cat, is the largest of all the wild cats in the Cape. He lives in the woods, and is spotted nearly in the same manner as the tiger. The skins of these animals are excellent furs both for warmth and ornament, and they bring a good price at the Cape; <HI>Descript. du Cap. de Bonne-esperance, par Kolbe, tom. 3. p.</HI> 50.</NOTE>,
<PB N="242" REF="289"/>
resembles the cat in its figure, and the tiger (that
is, the panther or leopard) by the black and white
spots of its hair. “This serval,” they remark,
“is four times larger than a cat. He is very
voracious, and eats apes, rats, and other ani∣mals.”</P>
<P>From comparing the serval with the <HI>chat-pard,</HI>
or mountain cat, described by the Gentlemen of
the academy, we discovered no other differences
than the long spots on the back, and the annula∣ted
tail of the former, which were wanting in the
latter. The spots on the back of the serval are
only placed nearer each other than on the rest
of the body. But these differences are too slight
to create any suspicion concerning the identity
of the species of these two animals.</P>

<P>THE Ocelot is an American animal. It is
ferocious and carnivorous, and may be
ranked with the jaguar and couguar; for it ap∣proaches
them in magnitude, and resembles them
in figure and dispositions. A male and female
were brought alive to Paris by M. l'Escot, and
<PB N="244" REF="292"/>
we saw them at the fair of St Ovide in the month
of September 1764. They came from the
neighbourhood of Carthagena, and had been
carried off from their mother when very young,
in the month of October 1763. At the age of
three months, they had become so strong and
cruel, that they killed and eat a bitch which had
been given to them for a nurse. At the age of
one year, when we saw them, they were about
two feet in length; and it is probable that they
had not then acquired above one half or two
thirds of their full growth. They were exhi∣bited
under the name of the <HI>tiger-cat;</HI> but we
have rejected this precarious and compound ap∣pellation,
because the jaguar, the serval, and the
margay or Cayenne cat, were transmitted to us
under the same denomination, though each of
these animals differ from one another, as well as
from the ocelot.</P>
<P>Fabri is the first author who mentions this
animal in a distinct manner. He caused the
drawings of Recchi to be engraved, and from
these drawings, which were coloured, he com∣posed
a description of the ocelot. He likewise
gives a kind of history of it from the writings
and information of Gregoire de Bolivar. I have
made these remarks with a view to remove a
difficulty which had deceived all the naturalists
as well as myself. This difficulty is to ascertain
whether the two animals drawn by Recchi, the
first under the name of <HI>Tlatlauhqui-ocelotl,</HI> and
<PB N="245" REF="293"/>
the second under that of <HI>Tlacoozlotl, Tlalocelotl,</HI>
and afterwards described by Fabri as distinct
species, are not the same animal. Though the
figures are pretty similar, they were regarded as
distinct animals, because their names, and even
the descriptions of them, were different. I at
that time imagined that the first might be the
same with the jaguar, and therefore gave it the
Mexican name <HI>Tlatlauhqui-ocelotl,</HI> which I now
perceive did not belong to it: And, since I had
an opportunity of seeing both the male and fe∣male,
I am persuaded that the two described by
Fabri, are only the same animal, of which the
first is the male and the second the female. No∣thing
less than an examination of the male and
female together could have enabled us to detect
this error. Of all spotted animals, the robe of
the male ocelot is unquestionably the most beau∣tiful,
and the most elegantly variegated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Universum corpus pulchro roseoque subrubet colore, ex∣cepto inferiore ventre qui albicat potius; maculis rosarum effigie, nigricantibus omnibus intra suave rubentem colorem, totum ita corpus, pedes et cauda ordine quodam distinguun∣tur ut elegantem plane huic animali acu pictum tapetem vel peripetasma impositum crederes: Sunt autem maculae hae in dorso et capite rotundiores majoresque: Versus ventrem vero pedesque oblongiusculae et multo minores; <HI>Fabri apud Her∣nand. Hist. Mex. p.</HI> 498.</NOTE>. Even
that of the leopard is not to be compared with it
for vivacity of colours, and symmetry of design,
far less those of the jaguar, panther, and ounce.
But, in the female ocelot, the colours are fainter,
<PB N="246" REF="294"/>
and the design more irregular. This remark∣able
difference deceived Recchi, Fabri<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Si animalis figuram spectemus cum antecedente non nihil corporis delineatio congruit; si colorem et maculas quibus pingitur, plurimum discrepat. In hoc totius color corporis non rubicundus sed obscure cinereus apparet, praeter ventrem tamen qui albicat.

others.</P>
<P>When the ocelot has acquired his full growth,
he is, according to Bolivar, two feet and a half
high, and about four feet in length. The tail,
though pretty long, touches not the ground, and,
of course, exceeds not two feet. He is a very
voracious, and, at the same time, a timid ani∣mal.
He seldom attacks men, and is afraid of
dogs. When pursued, he flies to the woods, and
climbs a tree, where he remains, in order to
sleep, and to watch the passage of cattle or smal∣ler
animals, and darts down upon them, when∣ever
they are within his reach. He prefers
blood to flesh: Hence he destroys a great num∣ber
of animals; because, instead of satiating him∣self
by devouring their flesh, he only quenches
his thirst by drinking their blood<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dampier mentions this animal under the name of the <HI>tiger-cat.</HI> “The tiger cat of the Bay of Campeachy is about the size of a bull-dog. His legs are short, and his body re∣sembles that of a mastiff. But, in the head, hair, and the manner of hunting his prey, he has a great similarity to the tiger (<HI>jaguar</HI>), except that he is not so large. They are here very numerous. They devour calves, and game of all kinds, which abound in this country, and which render them less dangerous to men.... Their aspect is extremely proud and ferocious;” <HI>Dampier's voyage, vol. 2. p.</HI> 62.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="295"/>
In a state of captivity he retains his original
manners. Nothing can soften the natural fero∣city
of his disposition, or calm the restlessness of
his movements. For this reason, he is always
kept in a cage. “At the age of three months,”
says M. l'Escot, “when these two young ocelots
had devoured their nurse, I kept them in a
cage, and fed them with fresh meat, of which
they eat from seven to eight pounds a-day.
The male and female rub against each other
like our domestic cats. The males have a re∣markable
superiority over the females. Not∣withstanding
the violent appetite of these two
animals for flesh, the female never presumed
to partake till the male was satiated, or gave
her the pieces he had rejected. I sometimes
gave them a live cat, whose blood they sucked
till the animal died; but they never eat its
flesh. I put on board two kids for their sub∣sistence;
for they neither eat boiled nor salt∣ed
meat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter of M. l'Escot, who brought these animals from Carthagena to M. de Beost, correspondent of the Academy of Sciences, dated September 17. 1764. <HI>Nota,</HI> M. de Beost, who obligingly sent this letter to us, is a great adept in na∣tural history; and this is not the only opportunity we shall have of mentioning his communications.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>It appears from the testimony of Bolivar, and
likewise from that of M. l'Escot, that the female
<PB N="248" REF="296"/>
ocelot produces but two young at a litter; for
the latter informs us, that, before the two young
ones mentioned above were taken, the mother
was killed. The ocelots, like the jaguar, the
panther, the leopard, the tiger, the lion, and all
animals remarkable for the largeness of their size,
produce but a small number at a time. But the
productions of a cat, who may be associated with
this tribe, are numerous; which is a proof, that
the number produced depends more upon mag∣nitude
than figure.

<P>THE Margay is much smaller than the o∣celot.
In size and figure, he resembles the
wild cat, only his head is more square, his
muzzle and tail longer, and his ears more round∣ed.
His hair is also shorter than that of the
wild cat, and he is marked with black bands and
spots upon a yellow ground-colour. He was sent
<PB N="250" REF="300"/>
to us from Cayenne, under the name of the
<HI>tiger-cat.</HI> He, indeed, is of the same nature with
the cat, jaguar, and ocelot, animals who have
received the appellation of <HI>tigers</HI> in the New
Continent. According to Fernandez, this ani∣mal,
when full grown, is not so large as the ci∣vet;
and, according to Marcgrave, whose com∣parison
seems to be more just, he is of the size
of a wild cat, which he resembles likewise in na∣tural
dispositions, living on small animals, poul∣try,
&amp;c. But it is extremely difficult to tame
him, and he never loses his natural ferocity.
His colours vary, though they are generally such
as we have represented them. This animal is
very common in Guiana, Brasil, and all the o∣ther
regions of South America; and he seems to
be the same with the pichou<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Pichou is a kind of cat as tall as a tiger, but not so thick. His skin is equally beautiful. He makes great deva∣station among poultry; but happily he is not very common in Louisiana; <HI>Hist. de la Louisiane, par le Page du Pratz, tom. 2. p. 92. fig. p.</HI> 67.</NOTE> of Louisiana.
But the species is not so frequent in temperate
as in warm climates.</P>
<P>If we take a survey of these cruel animals,
whose skins are so beautiful, and whose nature
is so perfidious, we shall find, in the Old Con∣tinent,
the tiger, panther, leopard, ounce, and
serval; and, in the New Continent, the jaguar,
ocelot, and margay, which three appear to be
miniatures of the former, and possessing neither
<PB N="251" REF="301"/>
the same stature nor strength; they are also timid
and dastardly, in proportion as the others are
bold and intrepid.</P>
<P>There is still another animal of this genus,
which the furriers call <HI>Guèpard.</HI> We have seen
several skins of it, which resembled those of the
lynx in the length of the hair. But, as the ears
are not terminated by pencils, the guepard is not
a lynx. Neither is he a panther nor a leopard;
for his hair is not short, and he has a mane of
four or five inches long on his neck and between
his shoulders. The hair on his belly is likewise
three or four inches in length, and his tail is
proportionally shorter than that of the panther,
leopard, or ounce. He is nearly of the size of
this last animal, being only about three feet and
a half long His fur, which is of a very pale
yellow colour, is speckled, like that of the leo∣pard,
with black spots; but they are smaller and
nearer each other, being only three or four lines
in diameter.</P>
<P>I imagined that this animal was the same
with that mentioned by Kolbe under the name
of the <HI>tiger-wolf,</HI> whose description is below<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He is of the size of a common dog, and sometimes lar∣ger. His head is as big as that of a bull dog. His chops, as well as his muzzle and eyes, are large, and his teeth are very sharp. His hair is curled, like that of a water∣dog, and spotted like that of a tiger. His paws are large, and armed with great claws, which he retracts at pleasure, like the cats. His tail is short.—The lion, tiger, and leopard are his mortal enemies. They pursue him even to his den, dart upon him, and tear him in pieces; <HI>Descript. du Cap de Bonne-Esperance, par Kolbe, tom. 2. p. 69. Nota.</HI> The a∣nimal which this author calls the <HI>tiger,</HI> is the leopard, and what he calls the <HI>leopard,</HI> is the panther.</NOTE>.
<PB N="252" REF="302"/>
He is common in the neighbourhood of the Cape
of Good Hope. During the day he remains in
the clefts of rocks, or in holes which he digs in
the earth; and, in the night, he goes in quest
of prey. But, when he hunts, he makes a
howling noise, which alarms both men and ani∣mals;
so that it is easy either to avoid or to kill
him. In fine, the word <HI>guépard</HI> seems to be
derived from <HI>lèpard,</HI> the mode in which the Ger∣mans
and Dutch spell <HI>leopard.</HI> We have also
remarked, in this species, varieties both in the
ground-colour and in that of the spots. But all
the guepards have the common characters of
long hair on the belly, and a mane on the
neck.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>To the article <HI>Margay</HI> we must refer the ti∣ger-cat
of Cayenne, mentioned by M. de la
Borde in the following terms:</P>
<P>“The skin of the tiger-cat, like that of the
ounce, is very much spotted. Though he has
the dispositions of the fox, he is somewhat small∣er.
He is commonly found in the woods of
<PB N="253" REF="303"/>
Cayenne. He is a great destroyer of game,
such as the agoutis, akonchis, partridges, phea∣sants,
and other birds, whose young he seizes
in their nests. He is very alert in climbing
trees, where he conceals himself. He runs by
a kind of leaping; but his motion is not quick.
In his aspect, gait, and manner of lying in wait,
he has a perfect resemblance to the cat. At
Cayenne, I have seen several of them chained
in the houses. They allowed themselves to
be stroaked a little on the back. But they al∣ways
retained a degree of ferocity in their a∣spect.
They were fed with fish and meat,
boiled or raw: Every other food was disagree∣able
to them. They produce in all seasons,
whether summer or winter, and bring forth two
at a time in the hollows of corrupted trees.”</P>
<P>There is another tiger-cat, or rather a species
of wild cat, in Carolina, of which the late Mr
Colinson sent me the following notice.</P>
<P>“The male was of the size of a common cat,
being nineteen inches long from the nose to the
tail, which last was four inches in length, and
had eight white rings, like the maucauco. His
colour was a bright brown, mixed with gray
hairs. He was remarkable for pretty large
black bars along the body and sides, from the
head to the tail. The belly is whitish, with
black spots. The limbs are slender, and spotted
with black. His ears have a large aperture,
<PB N="254" REF="304"/>
and are covered with fine hair. On each side
of the nose, below the eyes, are two large and
remarkable black spots; below these spots, and
joining the lip, there is a tuft of stiff black hairs.
The make of the female is more slender. She
is of a reddish gray colour, without any spots
on the back; but, on the belly, which is of a
dirty white colour, there is a black spot.”

<P>WE are uncertain whether these two names
denote animals of different species. We
only know, that the jackal is larger, fiercer, and
more difficult to tame than the adive<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I have read, in some of our French chronicles, that, in the reign of Charles IX. many of the court ladies kept adives, instead of lap-dogs.</NOTE>; but that,
in every other article, the resemblance is perfect.
Hence the adive may be only the jackal render∣ed
smaller, feebler, and more gentle than the
wild race, by being tamed and kept in a dome∣stic
state; for the adive is to the jackal nearly
<PB N="356" REF="307"/>
what the lap-dog, or small water-dog, is to the
shepherd's dog. However, as this fact is only
exemplified in a few instances; as the species of
the jackal is not, in general, domestic, like that
of the dog; and, as differences so great seldom
happen among free species; we are inclined to
believe that the jackal and adive are really two
distinct species. The wolf, the fox, the jackal,
and the dog, though they approach very near
each other, constitute four different species. In
the dog-kind, the varieties are extremely nume∣rous.
Most of these originate from their do∣mestic
condition, to which they have been very
early reduced. Man has multiplied the races of
this species by mixing the great and the small,
the beautiful and the ugly, the long and the
short haired, &amp;c. But, independent of these races
produced by man, there are several varieties which
seem to derive their origin from the climate. The
English bull-dog, the Danish dog, the spaniel, the
Turkish dog, the Siberian dog, &amp;c. have received
their denominations from the countries which pro∣duced
them; and they appear to differ from each
other more than the jackal does from the adive.
Hence the jackals may have undergone several
changes from the influence of different climates;
and this idea corresponds with the facts we have
collected. From the writings of travellers it
appears that the jackals every where vary in
size; that in America, Cilicia, Persia, and in
all that part of Asia called the <HI>Levant,</HI> where
<PB N="357" REF="308"/>
this species is very numerous, troublesome, and
noxious; they are commonly as large as our
foxes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The jacard or adive is as large as a middle sized dog, and resembles the fox in its tail, and the wolf in its muzzle. They are reared in houses; but their natural disposition is to conceal themselves, during the day, in the earth, from which they go out in the night only to search for food. They go in packs, put the men to flight, and devour the children. Their cries are plaintive, and a person is apt to mistake the noise they make for that of children of different ages min∣gled together. The dogs hunt and drive these animals from the habitations of men; <HI>Voyage de Delon, p.</HI> 109.—In Persia there is a species of fox called <HI>Schacal,</HI> which the na∣tives commonly denominate <HI>Tulki.</HI> They are extremely nu∣merous, and nearly of the size of European foxes. The back and sides are covered with a kind of coarse wool and long stiff hairs. The belly is white as snow, the ears black as jet, and the tail is smaller than that of our foxes. We heard them roaming during the night around the village where we had put up, and were much troubled with their mourn∣ful and incessant cries, which resembled the voices of men in distress; <HI>Voyage d'Olearius, p.</HI> 531. The addibo (<HI>adive</HI>) re∣sembles the wolf in figure, hair, and tail. But it is smaller, and even less than the fox. It is an extremely voracious, but a stupid animal. In the night it roams about, and re∣mains in its hole during the day. In the dusk of the even∣ing nothing else is to be seen in the fields. These animals approach travellers, and stop to reconnoitre them, without any appearance of fear. They enter the houses and churches, where they tear and devour every thing they can find. What∣ever is made of leather is a favourite morsel. The adive yelps like a fox; and when one cries, all the rest reply. This instinct of crying all together seems not to be voluntary, but to proceed from pure necessity; for, when one of them enters into a house to steal, and hears the cries of his companions at a distance, he cannot refrain from crying also, and by this means detects himself; <HI>Voyage du P. Fr. Vincent Marie, chap.</HI> 13.—A chacali was kept for ten mouths in a house where I lived some time. This animal has so great a resemblance to the fox in size, figure, and colour, that most travellers are at first deceived with it. The greatest difference between them is in the head, the chacali having a head like a shep∣herd's dog with a long muzzle, and in the hair, which is coarse like that of the wolf. Its colour is also similar to that of the wolf; and it sends forth a stench, which infects every thing it touches.—This animal is extremely bold and vora∣cious.—He is not afraid to enter the houses.—When he meets a man, instead of flying instantly, like other animals, he looks at him with as much boldness as if he meant to brave him, and then runs off. He is very mischievous, and always apt to bite, whatever care is taken to soften him by caresses, or by giving him food. The one formerly men∣tioned, though taken when very young, and reared with as much attention as a favourite dog, was never rendered perfect∣ly tame: He allowed no body to touch him, and bit every person indiscriminately. He could never be prevented from leaping on the table, and carrying off every thing he could lay hold of. All the country of Natolia is crowded with these chacalis. During the night, they make a hideous noise round the villages, not only by barking like dogs, but by a certain sharp cry which is peculiar to them; <HI>Voyage de Dumont, tom. 4. p.</HI> 29.</NOTE>, only their legs are shorter, and their
<PB N="258" REF="309"/>
colour is a brilliant yellow; from which cir∣cumstances
they have been called the <HI>yellow</HI> or

Cape of Good Hope, and the other provinces of
Africa and Asia, this species seems to have un∣dergone
several variations. In these warm coun∣tries,
they are large; their hair is rather of a

of them are of different colours<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The jackal which the subjects of the King of Comania, near Acra, brought us, was as large as a sheep; but its legs were taller.

till it be proven by facts that they intermix and
produce together. Our conjecture concerning
the difference of these two species is the better
founded, as it seems to accord with the opinion
of the antients. Aristotle, after mentioning the
wolf, the fox, and the hyaena, gives some ob∣scure
intimations with regard to two other ani∣mals
of the same genus, the one under the name
of the <HI>panther,</HI> and the other under that of <HI>thos.</HI>
The translators of Aristotle have rendered <HI>pan∣ther</HI>
by <HI>lupus canarius,</HI> and <HI>thos</HI> by <HI>lupus cerva∣rius.</HI>
From this interpretation, it is obvious,
that they considered the panther and thos to be
animals of the same species. But I demonstra∣ted,
under the article <HI>Lynx,</HI> that the <HI>lupus cerva∣rius</HI>
of the Latins is not the <HI>thos</HI> of the Greeks.
This <HI>lupus cervarius</HI> is the same with the <HI>chaus</HI>
of Pliny, and with our lynx, which has not a
single character that agrees with the <HI>thos.</HI> Ho∣mer,
when celebrating the prowess of Ajax,
who alone attacked a band of Trojans, in the
midst of whom Ulysses found himself engaged,
after being wounded, compares him to a lion,
who suddenly falls upon a troop of <HI>thos</HI> collec∣ted
round a stag at bay, disperses, and pursues
them, as mean and dastardly animals. The
commentator of Homer interprets the word <HI>thos</HI>
by <HI>panther,</HI> which, he says, is a kind of weak,
<PB N="262" REF="313"/>
timid wolf. Thus the thos and panther have
been regarded as the same animal by several an∣tient
Greeks. But Aristotle appears to have di∣stinguished
them, though he has not assigned to
them different characters: “The internal parts of
the <HI>thos,</HI>” says he, “are similar to those of the
wolf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aristot. hist. anim. lib. 2. cap. 17.</NOTE>.... They copulate like dogs<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Idem, lib. 6. cap. 35.</NOTE>, and
produce two, three, or four young, who are
born blind. The body and tail of the thos
are longer than those of the dog; but, though
the former is not so tall, he is extremely nim∣ble,
and leaps to a great distance.... The
lion and thos are enemies<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Idem, lib. 9. cap. 1.</NOTE>, because they both
feed upon flesh, and must, therefore, dispute
about their prey.... The thos loves men<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Idem, lib. 9. cap. 44.</NOTE>,
and never attacks them; neither does he seem
to be much afraid of them. He fights with
the dog and the lion. For this reason the lion
and thos are never seen in the same places.
The smallest thos are the best. There are
two species of them, and some extend them to
three.” Aristotle says no more on the subject
of the thos, and he says still less concerning
the panther. It is mentioned only in one
passage, namely, in the 35th chapter of the
16th book of his history of animals: “The
panther produces four young, which are blind
<PB N="263" REF="314"/>
at birth, like the young wolves.” From com∣paring
these passages with that of Homer, and
those of other Greek authors, it appears to be
almost certain, that the thos of Aristotle is the
large jackal, and that the panther is the small
jackal, or adive. We see that he admits the ex∣istence
of two species of thos; that he mentions
the panther but once, and when treating of the
thos: It is therefore probable, that this panther
is the small kind of thos; and this probability
becomes almost a certainty from the testimony
of Oppian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oppian. de venatione, lib. 2.</NOTE>, who ranks the panther among the
number of small animals, such as the cats and
dormice.</P>
<P>Hence the thos is the jackal, and the panther
the adive: And, whether they constitute two
species, or but one, it is certain, that all the an∣tients
have said, with regard to the thos and
panther, applies to the jackal and adive, and to
no other animals. If we have remained unac∣quainted
with the true meaning of these names
till now, it must be ascribed to the ignorance of
the translators, and of our modern naturalists.</P>
<P>Though the species of the wolf approaches
near to that of the dog, yet the jackal is inter∣posed
between them. <HI>The jackal or adive,</HI> as
Belon remarks, <HI>is an animal between a wolf and
a dog.</HI> With the ferocity of the wolf, he pos∣sesses
a portion of the familiarity of the dog.
His voice is a howling, mixed with barks and

groans<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is of a fine yellow colour, smaller than a wolf, goes always in packs, and yelps during the whole night...

formidable to the larger species by their num∣bers.
They attack every kind of cattle and
poultry almost in the sight of men. They en∣ter
with insolence and boldness into the sheep∣folds,
the stables, and the cow-houses; and,
when they find nothing better, they devour the
leather of the harnessing, boots, and shoes, and
carry off what they have not time to swallow.
When live prey fails them, they dig up the bo∣dies
of men from their graves. The inhabi∣tants
<PB N="265" REF="316"/>
are obliged to stick the earth of their se∣pulchres
full of large spines, in order to prevent
these animals from scraping and digging; for a

They go in packs, accompany this ex∣humation
with mournful cries, and, when once
accustomed to human bodies, they never fail to
frequent the church-yards, to follow armies, and
to attend the caravans. They may be consider∣ed

putrid flesh does not disgust them. Their appe∣tite
is so perpetual and so vehement, that the
driest leather, skins, tallow, and even the ordure

hyaena has the same taste for putrid flesh: It
likewise digs dead bodies out of their graves;
and, from this practice, these animals, though
very different from each other, have often been
confounded. The hyaena is a solitary, silent,
savage animal, which, though much stronger

<P>IF a number of resemblances, joined to a per∣fect
conformity of internal parts, were suf∣ficient
to constitute unity of species, the wolf,
the fox, and the dog, would form but one; for
the resemblances are more numerous than the
differences, and the similarity of the internal parts
<PB N="269" REF="325"/>
is complete. These three animals, however, not
only constitute three distinct species, but are so
distant from each other, as to admit intermediate
species. The jackal is an intermediate species
between the dog and wolf; and the isatis is pla∣ced
between the fox and dog. The isatis has
hitherto been regarded as a variety of the fox.
But the description given of it by Gmelin de∣monstrates
it to be a different species.</P>
<P>The isatis is common in all the northern re∣gions
bordering on the frozen sea, and is never
found on this side of the 69th degree of latitude.
In the figure of the body, and the length of the
tail, he is perfectly similar to the fox; but his
head has a greater resemblance to that of the
dog. His hair is softer than that of the com∣mon
fox, and his fur is sometimes white, and
sometimes of a bluish ash-colour. The head is
short in proportion to the body; it is broad near
the neck, and is terminated by a sharp muzzle.
The ears are almost round. He has five toes
and five claws on the fore feet, and only four
on those behind. The penis of the male is
scarcely so thick as a goose quill. The testicles
are as large as almonds, and are so concealed
with the hair, that it is difficult to perceive them.
The hair over the whole body is about two inches
long, smooth, bushy, and soft as wool. The
nostrils and under lip are naked, and the skin of
these parts is black.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="326"/>
In both male and female, the stomach, viscera,
intestines, and spermatic vessels, are similar to
those of the dog: There is even a bone in the
penis of the male, and the whole skeleton re∣sembles
that of a fox.</P>
<P>The voice of the isatis partakes of the barking
of a dog and the yelping of a fox. The mer∣chants
who deal in furs distinguish two kinds of
isatis, the one white and the other of a bluish
ash-colour. The latter are most esteemed, and
their price advances in proportion to their blue∣ness
or brownness. This difference of colour is
not sufficient to constitute a difference of species;
for M. Gmelin was assured by the most experi∣enced
hunters, that, in the same litter, some of
the young are white, and others ash-coloured.</P>
<P>The isatis is an animal peculiar to the northern
regions. He prefers the coasts of the frozen sea,
and the banks of the rivers which fall into it.
He loves open countries, and never frequents
the woods. He is found in the coldest and most
naked mountains of Norway, Lapland, Siberia,
and Iceland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is probably by sailing on boards of ice that the foxes have found their way into Iceland, where they are very numerous. Some of them are black; but they are commonly gray or blue in summer, and white in winter; in which last season their sur is best; <HI>Anderson's Nat. Hist. of Iceland, tom. 1. p.</HI> 56.</NOTE>. These animals copulate in the
month of March; and, their organs of genera∣tion
being formed like those of the dog, they
cannot separate for some time. Their rutting
<PB N="271" REF="327"/>
season lasts fifteen days, or three weeks, during
which they are always in the open air; and af∣terwards
they retire to their holes, which are
narrow, very deep, and have several entries.
They keep their holes clean, and make beds of
moss in them. The time of gestation, like that
of the bitch, is about nine weeks. The females
bring forth about the end of June or beginning
of May, and generally produce six, seven, or
eight at a litter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Gmelin says, from the testimony of hunters, that these animals sometimes produce twenty or twenty-five at one litter. But this fact is extremely suspicious.</NOTE>, Those which are to be white,
are yellowish at birth, and those which are to be
of a bluish ash-colour, are blackish, and their hair
is then very short. The mother suckles and at∣tends
them in the hole during five of six weeks;
after which, she makes them go out, and brings
them victuals. In the month of September, their
hair is more than half an inch long. At this
period, those which are to be white, are almost
entirely so, except a brown band along the back,
and another across the shoulders. It is then that
the isatis is called the <HI>cross-fox</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">From this circumstance, it is probable that the <HI>vulpes crucigera</HI> of Gesner, <HI>Icon. quad. p.</HI> 190. and of Rzaczinski, <HI>Hist. Nat. Pol. p.</HI> 231. is the same animal with the isatis.</NOTE>. But this brown
cross disappears before winter, when they are
entirely white, and their hair more than two
inches in length. About the month of May, the
hair begins to fall off, and the moulting is finish∣ed
<PB N="272" REF="328"/>
in July: Hence the fur is good in winter
only.</P>
<P>The isatis lives upon rats, hares, and birds;
and, in seizing them, he uses as much address as
the fox. He swims across lakes in quest of the
nests of ducks and of geese, and eats the eggs and
the young. In these cold and desert regions, he
has no enemy but the glutton, who lies in am∣bush
for him.</P>
<P>As the wolf, the fox, the glutton, and the o∣ther
animals which inhabit the northern regions
of Europe and Asia, have passed from the one
continent to the other, and are found in Ameri∣ca,
the isatis ought likewise to be found there;
and I presume, that the silver-gray fox of North
America, of which Catesby<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nat. Hist. of Carolina, tom. 2. fig. p. 78.</NOTE> has given a figure,
is the isatis, and not a simple variety of the
fox.</P>

<P>In a letter from London, dated the 19th day

was brought from the vast deserts of Tartary,
situated between the rivers Jaïck, Emba, and
the sources of the Irtish. These cossacs are so
numerous in that part of the country, that the
Tartars transport annually 50,000 of their skins
to Oremburgh, from whence they are carried
to Siberia and Turkey. From the point of
the muzzle to the origin of the tail, this ani∣mal
is about one foot and eight inches in
length; and his tail is ten inches long.”</P>
<P>“The shape of the head, the mild aspect, and
the barking of this animal, seem to bring him
near to the dog. His tail, however, and his
fine soft fur, make him approach the fox.
His blood is ardent, and his breath has a dis∣agreeable
odour, like that of the jackal and
wolf.”</P>
<P>From the drawing, and still more from the
short descriptions of M. Demidoff and M. Gmelin,
this animal appears to be the isatis; and, for

both in Europe and Asia. In Canada, and other

name of <HI>carcajou.</HI> It is probable, that the ani∣mal
found near Hudson's Bay, called <HI>quick∣hatch,</HI>
or <HI>wolverene,</HI> by Mr Edwards<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edwards's history of birds, p. 103.</NOTE>, is the
same with the Canadian carcajou, and the Eu∣ropean
glutton. It is also probable, that the a∣nimal
mentioned by Fernandez, under the name
of <HI>tepeytzcuitli,</HI> or <HI>mountain dog,</HI> is the glutton,
whose species has been diffused as far as the de∣sert

<P>Olaus Magnus seems to be the first author
who takes notice of this animal. He says<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Olaus Magnus de Gent. Septent. p. 138</NOTE>,
that it is of the size of a large dog; that it has
the ears and face of a cat, strong feet and claws,
long, brown, bushy hair, and a rough tail like
that of the fox, but shorter. The glutton, ac∣cording
to Schoeffer<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Hist. de la Lapponie, par. J. Schoeffer, p. 314.</NOTE>, has a round head, strong
sharp teeth, like those of the wolf, black hair,
and a thick body and short legs, like those of the
otter. La Hontan<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Voyage de la Hontan. tom. 1. p. 96.</NOTE>, who first mentioned the
carcajou of North America, remarks, “Figure to
yourself a double sized badger, which is the
<PB N="276" REF="333"/>
most perfect idea I can give you of this ani∣mal.”
According to Sarrazin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. de l'Acad. des Sciences, anné 1713, p. 14.</NOTE>, who pro∣bably
had only seen young ones, the carcajous
exceed not two feet in length, and their tail is
eight inches. “They have,” says he, “a very
thick, short head, small eyes, and very strong
jaws, furnished with thirty-two sharp teeth.”
The quick-hatch of Edwards<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Edwards's history of birds, p. 103.</NOTE>, which appears
to be the same animal, was, this author remarks,
double the size of a fox: Its back is arched, its
head low, its legs short, its belly almost trailing
on the ground, and its tail of a middling length,
and bushy toward the extremity. All these au∣thors
agree, that this animal is only to be found
in the northern regions of Europe, Asia, and
America. M. Gmelin<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The glutton is the only animal, which, like man, can live equally well under the Line and under the Pole. He is every where to be seen: He runs from south to north, and from north to south, provided he can find any thing to eat; <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yage de Gmelin, tom. 3. p.</HI> 492.</NOTE> is the only writer who
seems to think that the glutton travels into warm
countries. But this fact appears to be very
suspicious, if not altogether false. Gmelin, like
some other naturalists<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Brisson, regn. anim. p. 235.</NOTE>, has perhaps confounded
the hyaena of the South with the glutton of the
North, which, though they resemble each other
in natural dispositions, and particularly in vora∣ciousness,
are very different animals.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="334"/>
The legs of the glutton are not made for run∣ning;
he even walks slow. But this defect of
nimbleness he supplies with cunning. He lies
in wait for animals as they pass. He climbs
upon trees, in order to dart upon his prey, and
seize it with advantage. He throws himself
down upon elks and rain-deer, and fixes so firm∣ly
on their bodies with his claws and teeth, that
nothing can remove him. In vain do the poor
victims fly, and rub themselves against trees.

continues to suck their blood, to enlarge the
wound, and to devour them gradually, and with
equal voracity, till they fall down<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The glutton is a carnivorous animal, somewhat less than the wolf.

He climbs upon a tree to watch for his prey; and, when any animal passes, he springs down upon its back, fixes himself firmly with his claws, and continues to gnaw with his teeth, till the poor animal, after many fruitless efforts to get rid of so trouble∣some a guest, at last falls down, and becomes a victim to this crafty enemy. Three strong greyhounds are necessary to kill the glutton. The Russians use theglutton's skin for muffs, and borders to their caps; <HI>Relation de la Grande Tartarie, p.</HI> 8.</NOTE>. It is in∣conceivable
how long the glutton can eat, and
how much flesh he can devour at a meal.</P>
<P>What is related by travellers, concerning this
animal, is perhaps exaggerated. But, though a
great part of their narrations were rejected,
what remains<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hoc animal voracissimum est; reperto namque cadavere, tantum vorat, ut violento cibo corpus instar tympani exten∣datur; inventaque angustia inter arbores se stringit ut violen∣tius egerat: Sicque extenuatum revertitur ad cadaver, et ad summum usque repletur, iterumque se stringit angustia pri∣ore, &amp;c.; <HI>Olai Magni hist. de Gent. sept. pag.</HI> 138.</NOTE> is sufficient to convince us, that
<PB N="278" REF="335"/>
the glutton is much more voracious than any of
our carnivorous animals: From this circum∣stance
he has been called the <HI>vulture of quadru∣peds.</HI>
More insatiable and rapacious than the
wolf, if endowed with equal agility, the glutton
would destroy all the other animals. But he
moves so heavily, that the only animal he is
able to overtake in the course is the beaver,
whose cabbins he sometimes attacks, and de∣vours
the whole, unless they quickly take to the
water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The carcajou is a small animal, but very strong and fierce. Though carnivorous, he is so slow and heavy, that he may be said rather to trail upon the snow, than to walk. The beaver is the only animal he is able to overtake; and this exploit he can perform in summer only, when the beavers are out of their cabbins: But, in winter, he endeavours to demolish their cabbins, and seize the inhabitants, which he is seldom able to accomplish; because the beavers secure their retreat under the ice; <HI>Hist. de l'Acad. des Sciences, année</HI> 1713.</NOTE>; for the beaver outstrips him in swim∣ming.
When he perceives that his prey has
escaped, he seizes the fishes; and, when he can
find no living creature to destroy, he goes in
quest of the dead, whom he digs up from their
graves, and devours with avidity.</P>
<P>Though the glutton employs considerable art
and address in seizing other animals, he seems
to possess no other talents but those which relate
<PB N="279" REF="336"/>
to appetite. It would appear that he even wants
the common instinct of self-preservation. He
allows himself to be approached by men, or
comes up to them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The workmen perceived at a distance an animal approach∣ing with slow and solemn steps. Some of them imagined it to be a bear, and others a glutton. They advanced, and found that it was a glutton. After giving it some severe blows with a cudgel, they seized it alive, and brought it to me..... After the many reports I had for several years heard from the Siberian hunters, concerning the address of the glutton in seizing other animals, and supplying, by cun∣ning, that swiftness which Nature has denied him, and in a∣voiding the snares of men, I was greatly surprised to see this one come as deliberately up to us, as if he had been in quest of his own destruction. Ysbrandt-ides calls the glutton a mis∣chievous animal, which lives only on flesh. “He is accustom∣ed,” this author remarks, “to conceal himself in the trees, and to lie in ambush, like the lynx, till a stag, a rain-dear, a roebuck, a hare, &amp;c. passes below, and then darts down, like an arrow, upon the animal, sinks his teeth into its body, and gnaws the flesh till it expires; after which, he devours it at his ease, and swallows both the hair and the skin. A waywode, who kept a glutton for his pleasure, threw it one day into the water, and let loose two dogs at it. But the glutton soon fixed upon the head of one of the dogs, and kept it under the water till the animal was suffocated.”.. The address employed by the glutton, continues M. Gmelin, in seizing animals, is confirmed by all the hunters... Though he devours all kinds of animals, whether alive or dead, he prefers the rain-deer.... He watches large animals like a robber on the highways, or he surprises them while asleep... He goes in quest of the snares laid by the hunters for diffe∣rent species of animals; but he never allows himself to be entrapped... The hunters of the blue and white foxes (isatis), which frequent the coasts of the frozen sea, complain much of the mischief done them by the glutton.... With much propriety they call him the <HI>glutton;</HI> for the quantity he eats is incredible. Though I frequently inquired of professed hunters, I never heard that this animal, when gorged, squee∣zed himself between two close trees, in order to force out the contents of his stomach, and to make room for a fresh grati∣fication of his insatiable appetite. This appears to have been the fable of a naturalist, or the fiction of a painter; <HI>Voyage de Gmelin, tom. 3. p. 492.—Nota.</HI> Olaus first put this fable in writing, and Gesner copied the figure of it, which had been designed by a painter.</NOTE>, without betraying the
<PB N="280" REF="337"/>
smallest apprehension. This indifference, which
seems to be the effect of imbecillity, proceeds,
perhaps, from a different cause. It is certain,
that the glutton is not stupid, since he finds
means to satisfy his appetite, which is always
vehement and pressing. Neither is he deficient
in courage, since he indiscriminately attacks all
animals he meets with, and betrays no symp∣toms
of fear at the approach of man. Hence,
if he wants attention to himself, it proceeds not
from indifference to his own preservation, but
from the habit of security. As he lives in a
country which is almost desert, he seldom sees
men, who are his only enemies. Every time
he tries his strength with other animals, he finds
himself their superior. He goes about with per∣fect
confidence, and never discovers the smallest
mark of fear, which always supposes some do∣lorous
event, some experience of weakness. Of
this we have an example in the lion, who never
turns away from man, unless he has experien∣ced
the force of his arms: And the glutton,
<PB N="281" REF="338"/>
trailing along the snows of his desert climate,
remains always in perfect safety, and reigns,
like the lion, not so much by his own strength,
as by the weakness of the animals around him.</P>
<P>The isatis is not so strong, but much more
nimble than the glutton, whom it serves as a
provider. The glutton follows the isatis in the
chace, and often carries off the whole, or a part
of its prey; for, when the glutton arrives, the
isatis, to avoid its own destruction, flies off with
precipitation. Both these animals dig holes in
the earth; but their other manners are different.
The isatis often goes in packs: But the glutton
travels alone, or sometimes with his female.
The male and female are generally found to∣gether
in the same hole. Even the most cou∣rageous
dogs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Via vix conceditur ut a canibus apprehendatur, cum un∣gulas, dentesque adeo acutos habeat, ut ejus congressum for∣mident canes qui in ferocissimos lupos vires suas extendere solent; <HI>Olai Mag. Hist. de Gent. sept. pag.</HI> 139.</NOTE> fear to approach, or to combat
the glutton. He defends himself with his claws

<P>I am now enabled to give a figure of the glut∣ton.
This animal was sent to me alive from the
most northern parts of Russia; and yet he lived
more than eighteen months at Paris. He was
<PB N="283" REF="340"/>
so tame, that he discovered no ferocity, and did
not injure any person. His voracity has been
as much exaggerated as his cruelty. He indeed
eat a great deal; but, when deprived of food,
he was not importunate. The animal is very
well represented in the plate; but we shall like∣wise
add a description of him. He is two feet
two inches long, from the point of the nose to
the origin of the tail. The muzzle, and as far
as the eye-brows, is black. The eyes are black
and small. From the eye-brows to the ears, the
hair is a mixture of white and brown. The ears
exceed not an inch in length, and the hair on
them is short. Below the under jaw, as well as
between the fore feet, the hair is spotted with
white. The length of the fore legs is eleven
inches, and that of the hind one foot. The tail,
including four inches of hair at its extremity, is
eight inches long. The four legs, the tail, the
back, as well as the belly, are black. Near the
navel is a white spot, and the organs of genera∣tion
are reddish. The under hair, or down, is
white: His fore feet, from the heel to the ex∣tremity
of the claws, are three inches nine lines
in length. The five claws are very crooked and
well separated. The middle claw is an inch and a
half long. There are five callosities under the toes;
four of them form a kind of semicircle below the
foot, the other is on the heel. On the hind feet,
there are five claws, nine callosities, and no heel.
<PB N="284" REF="341"/>
The breadth of the fore feet is two inches and a
half. The length of the hind feet is four inches
nine lines, and their breadth two inches nine
lines. He has six cutting teeth in the upper jaw,
of which one on each side is larger than the other
four; and five grinders, two of which are much
larger than the other three. In the under jaw,
he has five grinders, one of which is very thick.
There are a few hairs, about two inches long,
round the mouth, and above the eyes.</P>
<P>This animal is pretty mild. He avoids wa∣ter,
and dreads horses, and men dressed in black.
He walks by a kind of leaps; and eats pretty vo∣raciously.
After taking a full meal, he covers
himself in his cage with straw. When drink∣ing,
he laps like a dog. He utters no cry. Af∣ter
drinking, with his paws he throws the re∣mainder
of the water on his belly. He is almost
perpetually in motion. If allowed, he would
devour more than four pounds of flesh every
day. He eats no bread; and devours his food
so voraciously, and almost without chewing, that
he is apt to choke himself.</P>
<P>The glutton is common in most of the nor∣thern
regions of Europe, and even of Asia; but,
in Norway, according to Pontoppidan, he is
chiefly confined to the diocese of Drontheim.
This author remarks, that the skin of the glutton
is very valuable; that he is not shot with fire-arms,
to prevent his skin from being damaged;
<PB N="285" REF="342"/>
and that the hair is soft, and of a black colour,
shaded with brown and yellow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pontoppidan's Natural History of Norway.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We have likewise given the figure of an Ame∣rican
animal, a stuffed skin of which was sent to
M. Aubry, curate of St Louis, under the deno∣mination
of <HI>Carcajou.</HI> But it has no affinity to
that animal, which we remarked was the same
with our European glutton; for, as its claws are
not adapted for tearing prey, but for digging the
earth, we consider it as a neighbouring species,
or even as a variety, of the badger. When com∣pared
with the figure we have given of the bad∣ger,
the resemblance is apparent; from which it
differs, however, by having only four toes on
the fore feet: But the fifth toe, which was ap∣parently
wanting, might have been destroyed in
this dried skin. In this character, it differs e∣qually
from the carcajou and the glutton; be∣cause
both of them have five toes on the fore
feet. Hence it is doubtful whether this animal
be the true carcajou. We shall here add a de∣scription
of the stuffed skin, which is very well
preserved in the cabinet of M. Aubry. He was
assured that it was brought from the country of
the Eskimaux. From the end of the muzzle to
the origin of the tail, it was two feet two inches
long. Though it has a great resemblance to the
badger, it differs from him in the colour and
quality of the hair, which is softer, longer, and
more silky; and, by this character alone, it ap∣proaches
<PB N="286" REF="343"/>
to the carcajou, or the glutton of Eu∣rope.
It is nearly of the colour of the lynx,
being grayish white, with white stripes on the
head, but different from those of the badger.
The ears are short and white. It has thirty-two
teeth, six incisors, two large canine teeth, and
four grinders on each side; but the badger has
only six grinders. The hairs on the body, which
are commonly four and a half or five inches
long, are of four colours, namely, from the root
to near the middle, they are a bright brown, then
a bright yellow, then black, till near the point,
which is white. The under part of the body is
covered with white hairs. On the legs the hair
is of a deep brown colour. There are four toes
only on the fore feet, and five on those behind.
The claws of the fore feet are very large; the
longest on the fore feet are sixteen lines, and the
longest on the hind feet only seven. The trunk
of the tail is three inches eight lines in length,
and it is terminated and surrounded by long
yellow hairs.</P>
<P>I am convinced that the American carcajou is
the same animal with the European glutton, or,
at least, that it is a species very nearly allied to
the glutton. But I must remark, that I com∣mitted
a mistake, occasioned by a similarity of
names, and some natural habits, common to two
different animals. I imagined that the kinkajou
was the same animal with the carcajou. This
error I discovered by seeing two animals, the
<PB N="287" REF="344"/>
one at the fair of St Germain, in 1773, announ∣ced
by a bill as <HI>an animal unknown to all the na∣turalists,</HI>
which was true. Another, altogether
similar, is now alive at Paris, in the possession of
M. Chauveau, who brought it from New Spain.
We believe it to be the true kinkajou, and have
here given a figure of it. M. Chauveau imagi∣ned
that it might be an acouchi or a coati. He
remarks, indeed, that it has neither the long nose
nor the annulated tail of the coati; but that it
has the same hair, the same members, the same
number of toes, and the same canine teeth, which
are angular and chamfered on the sides. M.
Chauveau acknowledges, that it differs from the
coati by its prehensile tail, with which, when de∣scending,
it suspends itself, and adheres to every
thing it can lay hold of.</P>
<P>“This animal,” says M. Chauveau, “never
stretches out his tail, unless when his feet are
secure. He employs it with greater dexterity
in seizing and bringing to him such things as
he cannot otherwise reach. He lies down and
sleeps as soon as day appears, and awakes
at the approach of night. His vivacity is
then extremely great. He climbs with great
facility, and searches about continually. He
tears every thing he finds, either for amuse∣ment
or in quest of insects. Were it not for
this fault, he might be left at liberty. Even
before his arrival in France, he went about
freely during the night, and next day he was
<PB N="288" REF="345"/>
always found lying in the same place. He
may be wakened during the day; but the rays
of the sun seem to be extremely incommodi∣ous
to him. He is caressing, without being
tractable:. He distinguishes his master alone,
whom he follows. He drinks water, coffee,
milk, wine, and even aquavitae; which last,
when sugar is added to it, he drinks till he be
intoxicated, and continues to be sick for several
days. He eats indiscriminately bread, meat,
pot-herbs, roots, and fruits. His common
food, for a long time, has been bread soaked
in milk, fruits, and pot-herbs. He is passion∣ately
fond of odours, sugar, and confections.”</P>
<P>“He attacks poultry, and always seizes them
under the wing. He seems to drink their
blood; for he never devours them. When
he has his choice, he prefers a duck to a hen;
and yet he is afraid of water. He has differ∣ent
cries: When alone during the night, he
utters sounds nearly similar to the barking of
a dog, and he always commences with snee∣zing.
When he sports, or receives any injury,
he cries like a young pigeon. When he threa∣tens,
he whistles like a goose; and, when en∣raged,
his cries are loud and confused. He is
never in a passion but when hungry. His
tongue, which he sometimes thrusts out, is
immoderately long. The one in my possession
was a female; and, it is worthy of remark,
that, during the three years she has been in
<PB N="289" REF="346"/>
France, she was only once in season, and was
then extremely furious.”</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The following is M. de Sève's description of a
similar animal, exhibited at the fair of St Ger∣main
in the year 1773.</HEAD>
<P>“By its fur, it has a greater resemblance to
the otter than to any other animal; but its
toes are not connected by membranes. The
tail is as long as the body; but that of the ot∣ter
is only half the length of its body. When
walking, the length of its body gives it the air
of a polecat. But the tail and figure of the
head are different, and the latter has more re∣semblance
to that of the otter. The eye is
larger than that of the polecat. The face has
some resemblance to that of the small Danish
dog. His tongue is long, thin, and smooth.
He appears to be of a mild disposition, and
licks the hand of any person. Last Lent, when
I drew its figure, it was very gentle; but it
has been rendered mischievous by being fre∣quently
irritated by the populace. At present,
it sometimes bites after licking the hand. It
is young, and its teeth seem not to be fully
formed. It is of a restless disposition, and
loves to climb. It often sits on end, scratches
<PB N="290" REF="347"/>
itself with its fore feet like the apes, plays,
folds its paws into each other, and performs
many other monkey tricks. Like the squirrel,
it holds fruits and other food between its two
paws. Neither flesh nor fish is given to it.
When irritated, it endeavours to leap upon the
person, and its cry has a considerable resem∣blance
to that of a large rat. Its fur has no
odour. With great dexterity it hooks with its
tail such things as it wants to lay hold of, and
frequently hangs by the tail upon such bodies as
it meets with. I have remarked, that its toes,
which are of a considerable length, spontane∣ously
unite, when it walks or climbs; and they
spread not, like those of other animals, in the
action of supporting itself. In fine, this ani∣mal,
according to the account given by its ma∣ster,
came from the coast of Africa, where it
was called <HI>kinkajou,</HI> and the species is said to
be rare. This appellation, he supposed, was
derived from the name of the island or coun∣try
which it inhabits, being unable to learn any
more from the person who sold it to him. I
shall only say, that this kinkajou, which is a
female, approaches nearer to the otter than to
any other quadruped. Its hair is short and
thick, mixed with some longer hairs. The
hairs of the head, like those of the body and
tail, are of an olive yellowish colour, mingled
with gray and brown; and these colours vary
according to the light in which they are view∣ed.
<PB N="291" REF="348"/>
The colour of each hair, through its
greatest extent, is a grayish white, and a dusky
greenish yellow at the point. The fur is mix∣ed
with other hairs, whose extremity is brown,
beside large black hairs interspersed among the
rest, which form bands on the sides of the eyes,
and extend toward the front, and another band
which vanishes near the neck. The eye is very
similar to that of the otter. The pupil is small,
and the iris is of a reddish colour. The muzzle
is blackish brown, as well as round the eyes.
As in small dogs, the end of the nose is flat,
and the nostrils are much arched. The teeth
are yellow, and thirty-two in number. The
canine teeth are very large, the superior cross∣ing
the inferior. There are twelve cutting
teeth, four canine, and sixteen grinders. The
ears are longer than broad, rounded at the
points, and covered with short hair, of the
same colour with that on the body. The sides,
throat, and inside of the legs, are of a golden
yellow colour, which is extremely vivid in
some places. The same golden colour prevails
on some parts of the head and hind legs. The
belly is grayish white, tinged in some places
with yellow. The tail, which is every where
covered with hair, is thick at the origin, and
gradually tapers to a point at the extremity.
When walking, the animal carries its tail ho∣rizontally.
The under part of the paws is
naked, and of a vermilion colour. The claws
<PB N="292" REF="349"/>
are white, hooked, and guttered below. The
length of the whole animal is about two feet
five inches.”</P>
<P>The similarity of the names <HI>kinkajou</HI> and <HI>car∣cojou</HI>
led me, as well as other naturalists, to ima∣gine,
that they belonged to the same animal:
In the following passage from Denis, formerly
quoted in part only, where he tells us, that the
kinkajou, which I then apprehended to be the
carcajou, resembled the cat, I thought this tra∣veller
had been deceived; because all other tra∣vellers
agree in making the figure of the carca∣jou
similar to that of the glutton.</P>
<P>“The kinkajou,” says Denis, “has some re∣semblance
to the cat with brownish red hair.
Its tail is long, and erected on its back in two
or three folds. It has claws, and climbs trees,
where it lies in wait along the branches to dart
down on its prey. In this manner it seizes
the orignal, invests him with its tail, and gnaws
his neck till he falls. Notwithstanding the
swiftness of the orignal, and the force with
which he rubs against the trees and brush∣wood,
the kinkajou never quits its hold; but,
if he can reach the water, he is saved, because
the kinkajou is then obliged to separate from
him. Four years ago, a kinkajou attacked
one of my heifers, and cut its throat. The
kinkajous are hunted by the foxes. They
go in quest of the kinkajou when he lies in
<PB N="293" REF="350"/>
wait for the original, and never fail to carry
him off<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descript. geogr. et histor. des côtes de l'Amerique Septent. par M. Denis, tom. 2. p. 327.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>These facts correspond so well with the figure,
and description we have given of this animal,
that we may presume that they relate to the
same animal, and that the carcajou and kinkajou
are two distinct species, who have nothing in
common, except their darting upon the original
and other quadrupeds, in order to drink their
blood.</P>
<P>We formerly remarked, that the kinkajou was
found in the mountains of New Spain: But he
is likewise found in those of Jamaica, where the
natives call him <HI>poto.</HI> Mr Colinson sent me a
figure of this poto or kinkajou, which I have in∣serted,
together with the following notice.</P>
<P>“The body of this animal,” says Mr Colinson,
“is red, mixed with ash-colour. The hair is
short, but very thick, the head rounded, the
muzzle short, naked, and blackish: The eyes
are brown, the ears short and round, and the
hairs round the mouth are long; but, as they
lie flat on the muzzle, they do not form whis∣kers.
The tongue is narrow and long, and the
animal often thrusts it three or four inches out
of his mouth. The tail is of one uniform co∣lour,
and gradually tapers to a point: It is
bended upwards when the animal walks, and
has the prehensile faculty. The length of
<PB N="294" REF="351"/>
the creature is about fifteen inches, and that
of the tail seventeen.”</P>
<P>“This animal was taken in the mountains of
Jamaica. He is mild, and may be handled
without danger. He is drowsy during the
day, and extremely vivacious in the night. He
differs much from every other quadruped. His
tongue is not so rough as that of the cat, or
other animals of the <HI>viverra</HI> genus, to which
he is related by the form of the head and claws.
Round his mouth are many curled, soft hairs,
from two to three inches long. The ears are
situated nearly opposite to the eyes. When he
sleeps, he rolls himself up into a ball, like the
hedgehog, with his fore feet under his cheeks.
With his tail, he can draw a weight equal to
that of his own body.”</P>
<P>From comparing the two figures, and the de∣scriptions
of Mr Colinson and of M. Simon
Chauveau, it is evident, that they both relate to
the same animal, except some slight varieties,
which change not the species.

<P>WE have given the generic name <HI>Mouffette</HI>

<P>We are indebted for our knowledge of two
of these animals to M. Aubry, whose taste and
skill in natural history are conspicuous in his
cabinet, which is one of the most curious in Pa∣ris.
He obligingly communicated to us all his
treasures, as often as we required them; and
this will not be the only opportunity we shall
have of expressing our gratitude. The animals
we borrowed from Mr Aubry, in order to have
them drawn and engraved, are the coase, the
chinche, and the zorilla; the two last of which
may be regarded as new; because there is no
figure of them to be found in any author.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="360"/>
The first of these animals was transmitted to
M. Aubry, under the name of <HI>pekan, devil's
child,</HI> or <HI>wild cat of Virginia.</HI> I perceived that
it was not the pekan, rejected all the compound
denominations, and discovered that it was the
<HI>ysquiepatl</HI> of Hernandes, and the <HI>squash</HI> of o∣ther
travellers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ysquiepatl,</HI> whose colour resembles that of burnt maize.—Its head resembles that of a young fox; and its snout is nearly like that of a hog. The Americans call it <HI>quasje; Seba, vol. 1. p. 68. Note.</HI> This authority is a farther proof that <HI>squash</HI> or <HI>coase,</HI> is the true name of the animal.</NOTE>; from which last appellation I
derived the name <HI>coase.</HI> It is about sixteen in∣ches
long, including the head and body. The
legs are short, the muzzle thin, and the ears
small. The hair is of a deep brown colour, and
the claws are black and sharp. It lives in the
holes and clefts of rocks, where the female brings
forth her young. It feeds upon beetles, worms,
and small birds; and, when it gets admission to
the court-yards, it destroys the poultry, of which
it only eats the brain. When afraid or irrita∣ted,
it emits an odour so abominable, that nei∣ther
men nor dogs dare approach. Its urine,
which apparently mingles with this pestiferous
odour, stains and infects in an indelible manner.
It appears, however, that this disagreeable odour
is not constant: “This animal,” Seba remarks,
“was sent me alive from Surinam; and I kept
it during a whole summer in my garden,
where it was secured by a small chain. It ne∣ver
<PB N="300" REF="361"/>
bit any person; and when it was presented
with food, it allowed itself to be handled like a
small dog. It dug the earth with its snout and
fore feet, which were armed with long crooked
claws. During the day, it concealed itself in a
kind of den which it had made. It came out
in the night, and, after trimming itself, it be∣gan
to run about, from right to left, as far as
its chain would permit; and this exercise it
continued till morning. It searched every
where with its nose on the ground. It was
served with victuals every night, and never took
any food but what was agreeable to its nature.
It was not fond of flesh, bread, and several o∣ther
kinds of nourishment. Maybugs, boiled
shrimps, caterpillars, and spiders, were its chief
delicacies. About the end of autumn, it was
found dead in its hole, being unable to endure
the cold. The hair on the back is of a deep
chesnut colour; the ears are short; the fore∣head
is round, and of a brighter colour than
the back; and the belly is yellow. The tail is
of a moderate length, covered with short brown
hair, and a kind of yellowish rings were per∣ceptible
all round it.”</P>
<P>Though Seba's description and figure corre∣spond
very well with those of Hernandes, it may
be doubted whether they relate to the same a∣nimal;
because Seba makes no mention of the
detestible odour, which he must unquestionably
have perceived in the course of a whole summer,
<PB N="301" REF="362"/>
during which he kept the animal in his gar∣den.
But no such doubt will remain, after we
are informed, that this animal does not send
forth its disagreeable odour, unless when irritated
or frighted; and that it is often tamed and kept
in houses by the inhabitants of different parts of
America<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notwithstanding the offensive quality of those animals, they are sometimes tamed by the English, French, Swedes, and Savages of North America. They are said to follow their masters like domestic animals, and that they do not throw out their urine, unless when beat or irritated. When a Sa∣vage kills any of them, he cuts out the bladder, to prevent their flesh, which is good eating, from being infected with the smell of the urine. I often met with English and French, who informed me, that they had eaten this flesh, and found it to be very well tasted, approaching nearly to the flavour of a pig. The Europeans put no value on the skin, on account of the length and coarseness of the hair; but the Savages make purses of it, &amp;c.; <HI>Kalm's travels, p.</HI> 417.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Of these four species of <HI>mouffettes,</HI> to which
we have given the name of <HI>coase, conepate, chin∣che,</HI>
and <HI>zorilla,</HI> the two last belong to the warm∣est
climates of South America, and may be va∣rieties
only, and not distinct species. The two
first inhabit the more temperate climates of New
Spain, Louisiana, the Illionois, Carolina, &amp;c.
and appear to be different species, particularly
the coase, which has only four toes on the fore
feet, while all the others have five. But all
these animals have the same figure, the same in∣stincts,
the same pestiferous odour, and may be
said to differ only in the length and colour of
<PB N="302" REF="363"/>
their hair. The coase is of a pretty uniform
brown colour. The conepate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The English denominate <HI>polecat,</HI> a species of animal which is common not only in Pensylvania, but in several other more northern and southern provinces of America. In New-York, its vulgar name is <HI>Skunck;</HI> and the Swedes in that country call it <HI>Fiskatte...</HI> This animal has a great resemblance to the martin, and is generally of a black colour, with three white bands which run longitudinall from head to tail. Some of them have been seen, though rarely, almost entirely white..... This animal brings forth its young in burrows, or in hollow trees: It continues not always on the ground, but mounts upon trees. It is an enemy to birds; for it breaks their eggs and eats their young. When it gets admission to a hen-house, it makes great havock.... When hunted, ei∣ther by men or dogs, he runs as well as he can, or climbs up a tree; and, when hard pushed, he darts forth his urine a∣gainst his pursuers.... The odour of his urine is so strong, that it suffocates. If a drop of this pestiferous fluid falls upon the eyes, the person is in danger of losing his sight; and, when it falls upon a man's clothes, it is extremely difficult to extract the smell from them. Most dogs fly from him the moment they perceive this odour. It requires more than a month to remove the smell from stuffs of any kind.... In the woods, it is often felt at a great distance. In the year 1749, one of these animals came near the place where I lodged. It was in winter and during the night. The dogs were wakened, and pursued it. In a moment, it diffused an odour so fetid, that I was almost suffocated in my bed, and the cows bellowed in a hideous manner.... About the end of the same year, another of them slipt into our cave; but it diffused not the smallest odour, which it never does, unless when pursued or irritated. A woman perceived its eyes sparkling in the dark, and killed it. The cave was instantly filled with such a noxi∣ous odour, that the woman was not only sick for several days, but the bread, meat, and other provisions were so infected, that they were obliged to be thrown away; <HI>Kalm's travels, p.</HI> 412.</NOTE>, upon a black
ground-colour, has five white bands which ex∣tend
<PB N="303" REF="364"/>
longitudinally from the head to the tail.
The chinche<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This animal was called <HI>chinche</HI> by the natives of Brasil. It is of the size of a cat. Its head is long, and tapers to∣ward the end of the upper jaw, which advances beyond the under, and both form a mouth which extends to the external angles of the eyes. The eyes are long and narrow: The u∣vea is black, and all the rest white. The ears are large, and nearly resemble those of a man, and their whole structure in∣dicates a delicate sense of hearing. Two white bands arise on the head, pass over the ears, and, receding from each o∣ther, terminate in an arch upon the sides of the belly. Its legs are short, and the paws are divided into five toes, armed with black claws, with which it digs holes in the earth. Its back is arched like that of a hog, and its belly is flat. The tail is of equal length with the body, and differs not from that of the fox. The hair is of a dark gray colour, and as long as that of a cat. It burrows in the earth like a rabbit; but its hole is not so deep. I have had much difficulty in extrac∣ting the bad smell of this animal from my clothes which had been infected by it. Though several times washed, soaked, and dried in the sun, it continued more than eight days. I was informed that this smell proceeds from the animal's urine, which it discharges on its tail, and by this means disperses it all around, in order to put the enemy to flight by the intolerable stench; that, for the same purpose, it urines in the entry to its habitation; that it is very fond of small brids and poultry; and that it is the chief cause of the destruction of birds in the country of Buenos-aires; <HI>Journal du P. Feuillée, p. 272—Note.</HI> The chinche appears to be the same animal with the <HI>chincille</HI> mentioned by Acosta. “The chincilles,” he remarks, “are small animals like squirrels, and their hair is wonderfully soft and smooth.... They are found in the Sierre of Peru;” <HI>Hist. Nat. des Indes Occident. p.</HI> 199.</NOTE> is white on the back, and black
on the flanks, with a head entirely black, except
a white line which extends from the nap of the
neck to the chanfrein of the nose. Its tail is
bushy, and covered with very long white hair,
<PB N="304" REF="365"/>
mixed with a little black. The zorilla<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The zorilla of New Spain is as large as a cat, with black and white hair, and a very fine tail. When pursued, it dis∣charges its urine as a defence; for the stench of this excretion is so strong, that it poisons the air all round to the distance of a hundred paces, and prevents the enemy from advancing. If it falls upon clothes, they must be buried for some time un∣der the ground, in order to remove the stench; <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yage de Ge∣melli Careri, tom. 6. p.</HI> 212.</NOTE>, which
is also called <HI>mapurita</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The mapurita is a small animal on the banks of the Oro∣nooko, and is perhaps the most beautiful, and, at the same time, the most detestible creature. The Whites of America call it <HI>mapurita,</HI> and the Indians <HI>mafutiliqui.</HI> Its body is all spotted with black and white, and its tail is adorned with beautiful hair. It is an active, mischievous, and strong ani∣mal.... The stench of its odour, which extends to a great distance, is so intolerable, that I was once almost suffocated by it.... The Indians, however, eat its flesh, and adorn themselves with its skin, which has no bad smell; <HI>Hist. Nat. de l'Orenoque, par Gumilla, tom. 3. p.</HI> 240.</NOTE>, seems to be a smaller
species. Its tail, however, is as bushy and as
beautiful as that of the chinche, from which it
differs in the disposition of the spots of the fur.

which there are longitudinal white bands, ex∣tending

It is justly denomina∣ted <HI>stinking;</HI> for its odour is infectious.... I once killed one of these animals, and my dog having darted upon it, returned and fanned upon me. A drop of the blood, and doubtless also of the urine, was left upon my coat, which was made of hunting ticking. The smell was so intollerable, that I was obliged to run home to change my clothes, &amp;c. <HI>Hist. de la Louisiane, par le Page du Pratz, tom.</HI> 2. p. 86.—When one of these animals is attacked by a dog, to ap∣pear formidable, it so changes its usual form, by bristling up its hairs, and contracting its length into a round form, that it makes a very terrible appearance. This menacing be∣haviour, however insufficient to deter its enemy, is seconded by a repulse far more prevailing; for, from some secret duct, it emits such fetid effluviums, that the atmosphere, for a large space round, shall be so infected with them, that men and other animals are impatient till they are quit of it. This stench is inspportable to some dogs, and necessitates them to let their game escape; others, by thrusting their noses into the earth, renew their attacks till they have killed it, but rarely care to have more to do with such noisome game, which, for four or five hours, distracts them. The Indians, notwithstanding, e∣steem their flesh a dainty, of which I have eat, and found it well tasted. I have known them brought up young, made domestic, and prove tame and very active, without exercising that faculty, which fear and self-preservation, perhaps, only prompt them to. They hide themselves in hollow trees and rocks, and are found in most of the northern continent of A∣merica. Their food is insects and wild fruit; <HI>Catesby's Carolina, vol. 2. p.</HI> 62.</NOTE> are nearly
<PB N="305" REF="366"/>
of the same figure, and of the size of an European

manners. The physical results of their organi∣zation
are likewise the fame. Of all the animals
on this Continent, the polecat diffuses the most
<PB N="306" REF="367"/>
disagreeable odour. This odour is only more
exalted in the mouffettes, whose species or va∣rieties
are numerous in America. But, in the
Old Continent, the species of the polecat is single;
for I believe not that the animal mentioned by
Kolbe, under the name of the <HI>stinking badger</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descript. du cap de Bonne-Esperance, par Kolbe, tom. 3. p. 86.</NOTE>,
which appears to be a real mouffette, exists at the
Cape of Good Hope as a native of that country.
It may have been transported from America;
and Kolbe, who is by no means exact in his

to denote different animals<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">It diffuses an insupportable odour. In Canada, the French call it <HI>devil's child,</HI> or <HI>stinking beast:</HI> Some of them, however, give it the name of <HI>pekan; Kalm's trav. p.</HI> 412.</NOTE>, and
particularly the mouffettes. By others, the a∣nimal
which ought to bear the name of pekan
has been called a <HI>fox</HI> or a <HI>wild cat;</HI> and it was
impossible to derive any precise knowledge from
such short and erroneous intimations. With re∣gard
to the <HI>vison,</HI> we are equally ignorant. We
know nothing of those names, except that they
belong to two North American animals. We
<PB N="308" REF="373"/>
found these two animals in the cabinet of M.
Aubry, who obligingly permitted us to describe
and draw them.</P>
<P>The pekan has so strong a resemblance to the
pine weasel, and the vison<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am inclined to thin, that the animal mentioned by Sagard Theodat, under the name of <HI>Ottay,</HI> is the same with the vison: The ottay,' he remarks, “is as large as a small rab∣bit. Its hair is very black, and so soft, polished, and fine, that it resembles velvet.” The Canadians are fond of these skins, and make garments of them; <HI>Voyage au pays des Hu∣rons, p.</HI> 308. No Canadian animal corresponds so well with this description as the vison.</NOTE> to the martin, that
they may be regarded as varieties of these spe∣cies.
They not only have the same figure, the
same proportions, the same length of tail, the
same quality of hair, but the same number of
teeth and claws, and the same instinct and man∣ners.
Hence we may conclude, that the pekan
is a veriety of the pine weasel, and the vison a
variety of the martin, or, at least, that the spe∣cies
are so allied, that they exhibit no real diffe∣rence.
The hair of the pekan and vison is on∣ly
browner, more lustrous and silky than that of
the pine weasel and the martin. But this diffe∣rence,
it is well known, is common to them
with the beaver, the otter, and other animals of
North America, whose furs are more beautiful

<P>THE Sable is mentioned by almost every
naturalist, without knowing more of it
than the skin. M. Gmelin is the first who gave
a figure and description of this animal. He
saw two of them alive in the house of the gover∣nour
of Tobolski. “The sable,” says he, “re∣sembles
the martin in the form and habit of
<PB N="310" REF="377"/>
body, and the weasel in the teeth. It has six
cutting teeth pretty long and a little crooked,
and two canine, in the under jaw, and small
sharp teeth in the upper. It has long whis∣kers
round the mouth, and large feet, all arm∣ed
with five claws. These characters were
common to both the sables. But the one was
of a blackish brown colour all over the body,
except the ears, and below the chin, where
the hair was a little yellow. The other was
smaller, and of a yellowish brown colour,
with the ears and under part of the chin of a
paler cast. These are their winter colours;
for, in spring, they change by the shading of
the hair. The first sable, which was of a
blackish brown, changes into a brownish yel∣low
in spring; and the second, which was of
a yellowish brown, becomes a pale yellow. I
admired,” continues M. Gmelin, “the agility
of these animals. Whenever they perceive a
cat, they rise upon their hind feet, to prepare
for the combat. In the night, they are ex∣tremely
restless and active<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This restless activity during the night is not peculiar to the sable. The same thing I remarked in two ermines, which I kept for several months.</NOTE>. During the day,
on the contrary, and particularly after eating,
they generally sleep half an hour or an hour,
when they may be pushed, shaken, and even
pricked, without awaking.” From this de∣scription
we learn, that the sables are not all of
<PB N="311" REF="378"/>
the same colour; and, consequently, that the no∣menclators,
who describe them by the spots
and colours of the hair, have employed a fal∣lacious
character; for their colour not only va∣ries
in different seasons, but the individuals of
the same and of different climates differ from
each other.</P>
<P>The sables inhabit the banks of rivers, and
the thickest parts of the woods. They leap
with great agility from tree to tree, and avoid
the rays of the sun, which are said, in a short
time, to change the colour of their hair. It is
pretended, that they conceal themselves, and lie
in a torpid state during the winter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of the two sables mentioned by M. Gmelin, the first came from the province of Tomskien, and the second from that of Beresowien. We likewise learn, from his account of Siberia, that there are on the mountains of Sopka-Sinaia, black sables with short hair, the hunting of which is prohi∣bited; and that a similar kind is also found in the more ad∣vanced mountains, as well as among the Calmucks Vrangai. I saw,' says he, “some of their skins which the Calmucks had brought down: They are distinguished by the name of <HI>Kangaraga sables;” Voyage de Gmelin, tom. 1. p.</HI> 217.</NOTE>; and yet
this is the best season for hunting them, because
their fur is then better and more beautiful than
in summer. They live upon rats, fishes, pine
tops, and wild fruits. They are very ardent
in their amours: During their season of love,
they emit a strong odour, and their excrements,
at all times, have a disagreeable smell. They
are chiefly found in Siberia: There are not
<PB N="312" REF="379"/>
many of them in the forest of Great Russia,
and still fewer in Lapland. The blackest sables
are most esteemed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The sable differs from the martin by being smaller, and having finer and longer hair. The true sables are damasked with black, and are taken in Tartary. There are few of them in Lapland. The fur is esteemed in proportion to the blackness of the hair, and sometimes sells at sixty crowns, though the width of the skin exceeds not four inches. Some of them have been seen white, and others gray; <HI>Regnard, tom. 1. p.</HI> 176. Scheffer likewise remarks, that white sables are sometimes found; <HI>Hist. de la Lapponie, p.</HI> 318.</NOTE>. The sable differs from all
other furs in this circumstance, that the hair
turns with equal ease to any side.</P>
<P>The hunting of the sbles is carried on by
criminals confined to Siberia, or by soldiers sent
for the purpose, who generally remain there se∣veraly
years. Both are obliged to furnish a cer∣tain
quantity of furs. They shoot with a single
ball, to injure the skin as little as possible; and
sometimes, instead of fire-arms, they use cross-bows
and small arrows. As the success of this
hunting requires much address and assiduity, the
officers are allowed to encourage the soldiers,
by giving them a proportional part of all the
sables they kill above what they are obliged to
furnish weekly, which turns out to be a consi∣derable
premium<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A colonel, from seven years service in hunting sables, may draw, of clear profit, four thousand crowns, the subal∣terns in proportion, and each soldier six or seven hundred; <HI>Voyage du P. Avril, p</HI> 169. See also <HI>Relat. de la Muscovie, par la Neaville, p.</HI> 217.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="380"/>
Some naturalists have suspected that the sable
is the <HI>satherius</HI> of Aristotle; and I believe their
conjecture is well founded. The fineness of the
fur is a proof that the animals are often in wa∣ter;
and travellers inform us<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The hunters go to the small islands in quest of sables, where they retire. They are killed with a kind of cross-bows, &amp;c.; <HI>Voyage du P. Avril, p.</HI> 168.</NOTE>, that they are ne∣ver
very numerous, but in small inslands, where
the hunters go in quest of them. Besides, A∣ristotle
mentions the satherius as a water ani∣mal,
and ranks it with the otter and beaver. It
is likewise to be presumed, that, when Athens
was in its splendor, these beautiful furs were
known in Greece, and that the animal which
furnished them had a name. Now, there is
no name which can more properly be applied
to the sable, than that of <HI>satherius,</HI> especially if
it be true that the sable eats fish<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In umbrosis saltibus versatur semper, insidiatur aviculis.—In escam assumit mures, pisces, uvas rubeas; <HI>Rzaczinski, auct. hist. nat. Poion. p.</HI> 318.</NOTE>, and con∣tinues

<P>To the article sable we have nothing to
add, but some facts, related by the Russian
travellers, which are published in the last vo∣lumes
of the <HI>Hist. Gen. des voyages.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="381"/>
“The sables live in holes of corrupted trees,
or under their roots, or on rocky eminences.
Their nests are constructed with moss, branches
of trees, and turf. In these holes or nests,
they continue twelve hours, both in summer
and winter. The remainder of their time
is occupied in quest of subsistence. In spring,
they feed upon weasels, ermines, squirrels,
and especially hares. But, in the fruit sea∣son,
they eat bay-berries, and the fruit of the
service-tree. In winter, they catch small birds
and woodcocks. When the snow falls, they
retire to their holes, where they remain some∣times
three weeks. They copulate in the
month of January. Their amours continue
one month, and often produce bloody combats
between the males. After copulation, they
remain in their nests about fifteen days. The
females bring forth about the end of March,
and produce from three to five young, whom
they suckle four or six months.”</P>
<P>“The hunters go, in companies of forty, in
quest of these animals during the winter only,
and use canoes, with provisions for three or
four months. They have a chief, who, when
they arrive at the rendezvous, assigns to each
band a particular quarter, and all the hunters
are obliged to obey him. The snow is re∣moved
from the places where the snares are
to be laid; and each hunter prepares twenty
of them daily. The hunters choose a small
spot in the vicinity of trees, surround it, to a
<PB N="315" REF="382"/>
certain height, with sharp stakes, and cover
it with thin planks, to prevent the entrance of
the snow. They leave a narrow passage, above
which is placed a beam, supported only by a
small twig; and, as soon as the sable touches
it, to carry off the piece of flesh or fish, put
there for a bait, the beam falls and kills the
animal. All the sables are brought to the
general conductor; or, rather, they are con∣cealed
in the holes of trees, to prevent the
Tongusians, or other savage people, from
stealing them. When the sables are averse
to enter these snares, the hunters have re∣course
to nets. When a hunters discovers
the track of a sable, he follows it till he dis∣covers
its hole, and, by means of smoke, o∣bliges
the animal to come out. He then
extends his net; and continues lying in wait,
in this manner, with his dogs, for two or
three days successively. This net is thirteen
fathoms long, and four or five in height.
When the sable leaves its hole, it seldom
escapes; for the dogs slay it when entangled
by the net. When discovered on the trees,
the hunter shoots them with blunt arrows.
to prevent the skins from being injured. The
hunting being finished, the company assemble
at the general rendezvous, and reimbark as
soon as the rivers become navigable by the
melting of the ice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Gen. des Voyages, tom. 19. p. 144.</NOTE>.”</P>

<P>OLAUS MAGNUS is the first who men∣tions
the leming. All that Gesner, Sca∣liger,
Ziegler, Johnston, &amp;c. have said concer∣ning
it, is borrowed from this author. But
Wormius, after the most accurate researches,
<PB N="317" REF="384"/>
has written a history of this animal, which he
describes in the following manner: “It has,” he
remarks, “the figure of a mouse; but the tail
is shorter, and the body about five inches long.
The hair is fine, and spotted with various co∣lours.
The fore part of the head is black,
and the hind part yellowish. The neck and
shoulders are black. The rest of the body is
reddish, and marked with small black spots of
different figures, as far as the tail, which ex∣ceeds
not half an inch in length, and is cover∣ed
with blackish yellow hairs. Neither the
figure, nor the order of the spots, are the same
in every individual. Round the mouth there
are several stiff hairs in the form of whiskers,
of which six on each side are longer and stiffer
than the rest. The opening of the mouth is
small, and the upper lip is divided, as in the
squirrels. From the upper jaw proceed two
long, sharp, and somewhat crooked cutting
teeth, the roots of which penetrate as far as
the orbits of the eyes. Two similar teeth in
the under jaw correspond with those above;
and there are three grinders on each side, situ∣ated
at a distance from the cutting teeth. The
first of the grinders is large, and composed of
four lobes, the second of three lobes, and the
third is much smaller. Each of these three
teeth has a separate socket, and they are placed in
the palate, at a considerable distance from one
another. The tongue is pretty large, and ex∣tends
<PB N="318" REF="385"/>
to the extremity of the cutting teeth.
From the remains of herbs and straw found
in its throat, we are inclined to think that it
is a ruminating animal. The eyes are small
and black, and the ears recline on the back.
The forelegs are very short, and the feet covered
with hair, and armed with five sharp, crooked
claws; the middle one is very long, and the
fifth is like a small thumb, or a cock's spur,
and sometimes situated equally high on the
leg. The whole belly is whitish, inclined to
yellow,” &amp;c.</P>
<P>These animals, though their body is thick,
and their legs very short, fail not to run pretty
quickly. They generally inhabit the mountains
of Norway and Lapland; but, in particular
years, they sometimes descend in such numbers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been remarked, that the lemmers appear not re∣gularly every year, but at certain unforeseen periods, and in such numbers, that they spread every where, and cover the whole surface of the earth.... These small animals, instead of being afraid, or flying from passengers, are bold and ob∣stinate, face those who attack them, and cry and yelp nearly in the same manner as small dogs. When attacked, they neither fear clubs nor halberds, but dart against those, who strike them, outrageously biting, and fixing upon the weapons employed to kill them. These animals, it is singular, never enter the houses or huts to do mischief; but keep always con∣cealed among the bushes and hillocks. They sometimes make war, and divide themselves into two armies along the lakes and meadows..... Their enemies are foxes and ermines, who devour great numbers of them..... Grass that has been eat down, and springs again, is said to kill them; and they seem likewise to commit suicide; for they are often found suspended on the branches of trees; and they probably throw themselves, in troops, into the waters, like the swal∣lows; <HI>Hist. de la Lapponie, par Schoeffer, p. 322. Nota.</HI> It would appear that the lemings, like the rats, mutually destroy and eat one another, when pasture fails them; and that this is the reason why their destruction is as sudden as their multiplica∣tion.</NOTE>,
<PB N="319" REF="386"/>
that the arrival of the lemings is considered as a
terrible scourge, the effects of which it is im∣possible
to avoid. They make dreadful devas∣tation
in the fields, lay waste the gardens, ruin
the crops, and leave nothing, except what is
shut up in houses, where they happily never en∣ter.
They bark nearly like small dogs. When
struck at with a stick, they seize it so forcibly
with their teeth, that they allow themselves to
be carried to a considerable distance without
quitting their hold. They dig holes in the earth,
and make roads, like the moles, in quest of
roots. At particular times, they assemble to∣gether,
and the whole die in company. They
are very courageous, and defend themselves a∣gainst
other animals. It is not known from
whence they come. The vulgar believe that
they fall from the clouds along with the rain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bestiolae quadrupedes, <HI>lemmar</HI> vel <HI>lemmus</HI> dictae, magni∣tudine soricis, pelle varia per tempestates et repentinos imbres—incompertum unde, an ex remotioribus insulis et vento de∣latae, an ex nubibus foeculentis natae deferantur.

The male is generally larger than the female,
and his black spots are also larger. Upon the
renewal of the grass, they infallibly die. In
fine weather they take to the water in vast mul∣titudes;
but, when a breeze of wind rises, they
are all drowned. The number of these ani∣mals
is so prodigious, that, when they die, the
air is infected, and produces many diseases.
They even seem to infect the plants which they
gnaw; for the pasture then kills the cattle. The
flesh of the lemings is not good to eat; and their
skin, though the hair be fine, does not answer
for making furs, because it is too thick.</P>

<P>“THE <HI>saricovienne,</HI>” (or sea otter), says The∣vet,
“is found along the river Plata.
It is of an amphibious nature, living more in
<PB N="322" REF="389"/>
the water than upon land. This animal is as
large as a cat; and its skin, which is a mix∣ture
of gray and black, is as fine as velvet.
Its feet resemble those of water-fowl; and its
flesh is extremely good and delicate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Singularités de la France antarctique, par Thevet, p. 107.</NOTE>.” I be∣gin
with the above passage, because the animal
is unknown to the naturalists under this name,
and because they know not that the <HI>carigueibeju</HI>
of Brasil, which is the same, has membranes
between the toes. Marcgrave, indeed, who
gives a description of it, mentions not this cha∣racter,
which is an essential one, since it brings
this species as near as possible to that of the
otter.</P>
<P>Besides, I believe that the animal mentioned
by Gumilla, under the name of <HI>Guachi</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">On the rivers which fall into the Oronoko, there are a great many water dogs, which the Indians call <HI>Guachi.</HI> This animal swims swiftly, and feeds upon fishes. It is am∣phibious; but goes likewise in quest of food upon the land. It digs ditches on the banks, where the female brings forth her young. These ditches are not made in retired places, but where the animals live in common, and come to amuse themselves. I carefully examined their habitations, and found them to be always exceedingly clean. They leave not the smallest herb in the neighbourhood. They heap up, at a distance, the fragments of the fishes they eat, and, by leap∣ing, going, and returning, they make their roads extremely neat and commodious; <HI>Hist. de l'Orenoque, par Gumilla, tom. 3. p. 29.

<PB N="323" REF="390"/>
be the same with the saricovienne, which is a
species of otter common throughout all South
America. From the description given of it by
Marcgrave and Desmarchais<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Desmarchais, tom. 3. p. 306.</NOTE>, it appears, that
this amphibious animal is as large as a middle
sized dog; that the top of its head is round like
that of the cat; that its muzzle is somewhat
long, like that of the dog; that it has the teeth
and whiskers of a cat; small, round, black eyes;
ears roundish, and placed low; five toes on each
foot, with the thumbs shorter than the other
toes, which are all armed with sharp brown
claws. The tail is as long as the hind legs.
The hair is pretty short and very soft. It is
black on the body, and brown on the head, with
a white spot under the chin. Its cry is nearly
like that of a young dog; and it is sometimes
interrupted by another cry similar to that of the
sagoin, or fox-tailed monkey. It feeds upon
crabs and fishes; but it may likewise be nourish∣ed
with the flour of manioc diluted in water.
Its skin makes a good fur; and, though it lives
chiefly on fishes, its flesh is very good, whole∣some,
and has no bad flavour.</P>

<HEAD>The CANADIAN OTTER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS otter, which is much larger than
ours, and ought to be found in the north
of Europe, as well as in Canada, affords me an
opportunity of inquiring whether it is the same
animal with the <HI>latax</HI> of Aristotle, which, he re∣marks,
is much larger and stronger than the
common otter. But the ideas he gives of it
correspond not entirely with this large otter; and,
finding that it was perfectly similar to the com∣mon
otter, except in size, I thought it was not a
particular species, but a simple variety: And, as
the Greeks, and especially Aristotle, were care∣ful
not to give different names but to distinct
species, we are persuaded, that the <HI>latax</HI> is an∣other
animal. Besides, as the otters, like the bea∣vers,
are generally larger, and have finer and
blacker hair in America<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The otters of North America differ from those of France by being commonly longer and blacker. They are of diffe∣rent shades, and some of them are as black as jet; and those last are dearest and in greatest request; <HI>Descript. de l'Amerique Seplent. par Dennis, tom. 2. p.</HI> 280.</NOTE> than in Europe, this
otter of Canada ought to be longer and blacker

what the <HI>latax</HI> of Aristotle might be, I conjec∣tured

<P>In this passage, Aristotle mentions six amphi∣bious
animals; and, of these six, we know only
three, the common seal, the beaver, and the ot∣ter.
The other three, namely, the <HI>latax,</HI> the
<HI>satherion,</HI> and the <HI>satyrion,</HI> remain unknown, be∣cause
they are only pointed out by their names,
without any description. In this case, as in all
those where no direct induction can be derived
<PB N="326" REF="393"/>
from a knowledge of the object, we must have
recourse to the mode of exclusion; but this mode
can never be employed with success, except when
we know nearly the whole subject. For ex∣ample,
from long study, I believe that I am ac∣quainted
with nearly the whole quadruped tribe.
I know that Aristotle could have no information
concerning those which are peculiar to the Con∣tinent
of America. Of the quadrupeds, I like∣wise
know all those which are amphibious: From
these I, in the first place, strike off all those
which belong to America, as the tapir, the ca∣biai,
the ondatra, or musk-rat, &amp;c. There re∣main
only the amphibious animals of our own
Continent, which are, the hippopotamus, the
walrus or sea-cow, the seals or sea-calves, the
sea-wolf of Belon, the beaver, the otter, the sable,
the water-rat, the Muscovy musk-rat, the wa∣ter
shrew-mouse, and, if you choose, the ichneu∣mon,
which some authors have regarded as an
amphibious animal, and called it the <HI>Egyptian
otter.</HI> From this number, I retrench the wal∣rus
or sea-cow, which, being found only in the
northern seas, was unknown to Aristotle. I
likewise retrench the hippopotamus, the water-rat,
and the ichneumon, because he mentions
them elsewhere under their proper names. Last∣ly,
I retrench the seals, the beaver, and the ot∣ter,
which are well known, and the water shrew
mouse, which is too similar to the land one to
have ever received a separate name. There re∣main,
<PB N="327" REF="394"/>
then, the sea-wolf of Belon, the sable, and
the Muscovy musk-rat, for the <HI>latax,</HI> the <HI>sathe∣rion,</HI>
and the <HI>satyrion.</HI> Of these three animals,
the sea-wolf of Belon alone is larger than the
otter: Hence it alone can represent the <HI>latax;</HI>
and, consequently, the sable and the Muscovy
musk-rat must represent the <HI>satherion</HI> and the
<HI>satyrion.</HI> These conjectures, which I believe to
be well founded, are not, however, of the num∣ber
of those which time can elucidate, unless
some Greek manuscripts, hitherto unknown,
shall be discovered, where these names are em∣ployed,
and new explications given of them.</P>

<HEAD>The SEALS, the WALRUS, and

<P>LET us assemble, for a moment, all the
quadrupeds into one group, and let the in∣tervals
and ranks represent the proximity or di∣stance
between each species. Let us place in
the centre the most numerous genera, and on
the flanks those which are least numerous. Let
us confine the whole within narrow bounds,
that we may have the more distinct view of
them; and we shall find, that it is impossible to
round this inclosure. Though all quadrupeds
are more closely connected together than to any
other being; yet several of them make promi∣nent
points, and seem to fly off in order to join
other classes of animated nature. The apes
make a near approach to man. The bats are the
apes of birds, which they imitate in their flight.
The porcupines and hedge-hogs, by the quills
with which they are covered, seem to indicate
that feathers are not confined to birds. The
armadillos, by their scaly shells, approach the
turtle and the crustaceous animals. The bea∣vers,
by the scales on their tails, resemble the
fishes. The ant-eaters, by their beak or trunk
without teeth, and the length of their tongue,

claim an affinity to the fishes. In fine, the seal,
the walrus, and the manati, are a separate corps,
and make a great projection, with a view to ar∣rive
at the cetaceous tribes.</P>
<P><HI>Seal, Walrus,</HI> and <HI>Manati,</HI> are rather gene∣ric
than specific denominations: Under the seal
we shall comprehend, 1. The <HI>phoca</HI> of the an∣tients,
which is probably that we have repre∣sented
in the figure: 2. The common seal, or
sea-calf. 3. The great seal, of which Mr Par∣sons
has given a figure and description in the
<HI>Philosophical Transactions,</HI> No. 469. 4. The
very large seal, or <HI>sea-lion,</HI> described and paint∣ed
by the author of Anson's voyage.</P>
<P>Under the name <HI>Walrus,</HI> we comprehend the
animals commonly called <HI>sea-cows,</HI> or <HI>sea-horses,</HI>
of which we know two species, the one found
only in the northern, and the other in the sou∣thern
seas; the last is called <HI>dugon</HI> or <HI>Indian wal∣rus.</HI>
In the last place, under the term <HI>manati,</HI>
we comprehend the animals called <HI>lamantins,</HI> or
<HI>sea-oxen,</HI> in St. Domingo, Cayenne, and other
parts of South America, as well as the <HI>lamantin</HI>
of Senegal, and other parts of the coast of Afri∣ca,
which appears to be only a variety of the
American kind.</P>
<P>The seal and walrus are more nearly allied to
the quadrupeds than to the cetaceous animals; be∣cause
they have a kind of four feet. But the manati,
who have only two fore-feet resemble the ceta∣ceous
tribes more than the quadrupeds. Both
<PB N="330" REF="398"/>
differ from other animals by a singular charac∣ter:
Thy alone can live equally in air and in wa∣ter;
and, consequently, they alone merit the ap∣pellation
of <HI>amphibious.</HI> In man, and the other
terrestrial viviparous animals, the <HI>foramen ovale</HI>
of the heart, which permits the foetus to live
without respiration, closes the moment after
birth, and remains shut during life. In the seal
and walrus, on the contrary, it is always open,
though the mothers bring forth their young on
land, and respiration commences immediately
after birth, as in all other animals. By means
of this perpetual aperture in the <HI>septum</HI> or par∣tition
of the heart, which allows a communica∣tion
of the blood from the vena cava to the a∣orta,
these animals enjoy the privilege of respi∣ring,
or not, at their pleasure. This singular
power is common to the whole of them: But
each possesses peculiar faculties, which shall be
pointed out, as far as we have been able to
learn, in the history of the particular species.</P>

<P>IN general, the seals, like man, have a round
head; a broad muzzle, like the otter; large
<PB N="331" REF="399"/>
high placed eyes; small or no external ears,
being only two auditory passages on each side
of the head; whiskers round the mouth; teeth
similar to those of the wolf; the tongue forked
at the end; a fine neck; the body, hands, and
feet, covered with short and pretty coarse hair;
no apparent arms, but rather two membranes or
skins, investing five fingers, and terminated by
five claws; two feet without legs, and perfectly
similar to the hands, only that they are larger,
and turned backward to unite with a very short
tail, which they accompany on each side; a
long body, like that of a fish, but thick at the
breast, narrow at the belly, without haunches,
crupper, or thighs. The structure of this ani∣mal
is so strange, that it served as a model, up∣on
which the imagination of the poets framed
the Tritons, Sirens, and Sea-gods, with a hu∣man
head, the body of a quadruped, and the
tail of a fish. The seal, in effect, reigns, in this
inute empire, by his voice, his figure, his intel∣ligence,
and his talents, which are common to
him with the inhabitants of the land, and ren∣der
him so superior to the fishes, that they seem
not only to belong to another order of beings,
but to a different world. This amphibious ani∣mal,
though his nature be very distant from that
of our domestic animals, is susceptible of a spe∣cies
of education. He is reared by keeping him
often in water; he is taught to give a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alute with
his head and his voice; he comes when called
<PB N="332" REF="400"/>
upon, and exhibits several other marks of intel∣ligence
and docility<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vituli marini accipiunt disciplinam, voceque pariter et visu populum salutant: Incondito fremitu nomine vocati re∣spondent; <HI>Plin. hist. nat. lib. 9. cap.</HI> 13.—A Dutch sailor had tamed a sea-calf to such a degree, that it performed a hundred monkey tricks; <HI>Voyag. de Misson, tom. 3. p.</HI> 113.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>His brain and cerebellum are proportionally
larger than in man. His senses are as good as
those of any quadruped; and, consequently,
his sensations are equally vivacious, and his
intellect equally active: Both are exhibited in
the gentleness of his manners, his social dis∣positions,
his affection for the female, his atten∣tion
to his offspring, and in the expressive mo∣dulation
of his voice, which is superior to that
of any other animal<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">On the coasts of Canada, we often heard, during the night, the voice of the sea-wolves, resembling nearly that of cats making love; <HI>Hist de la Nouv.

He is also endowed
with strength and weapons of defence. His body
is large and firm, and his teeth and claws are sharp.
Besides, he enjoys advantages which are pecu∣liar
to him. He is neither afraid of cold nor of
heat. He lives indifferently on herbs, flesh, or
fish. He inhabits, without inconvenience, wa∣ter,
land, and ice. He, along with the walrus,
alone deserves the epithet of <HI>amphibious.</HI> He
alone has the <HI>foramen ovale</HI> of the heart open<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">As the seals are destined to remain a long time in the wa∣ter, and as the transmission of the blood through the lungs cannot be performed without respiration, they have the fora∣men ovale open, as in the foetus, which never respires. It is an aperture which makes a communication between the right ventricle of the heart and the left, and allows the blood to pass directly from the cava into the aorta, instead of the long winding course of the lungs; <HI>Hist. de l'Acad. des sciences, tom. 1. p.</HI> 84.</NOTE>;
<PB N="333" REF="401"/>
and, consequently, he alone can dispense with
respiration, the elements of air and water being
equally agreeable to him. The otter and bea∣ver
are not really amphibious, since air is their
proper element; and, as, they are deprived of
this aperture through the septum of the heart,
they cannot remain long under water, but are
obliged either to leave it, or to raise their heads
above it, in order to respire.</P>
<P>But these advantages, which are great, are ba∣lanced
by imperfections still greater. The seal
is a kind of crippled animal. His arms, thighs,
and legs, are almost entirely shut up within his
body. Nothing appears without, except his
hands and feet, which are, it is true, divided
into five fingers; but these fingers are not se∣partely
moveable, being united by a strong
membrane; and these extremities are rather fins
than hands and feet, a kind of instruments adapt∣ed
for swimming, and not for walking. Be∣sides,
the feet are directed backward, like the
tail, and cannot support the body of the animal,
which, when on land, is under the necessity of
<PB N="334" REF="402"/>
trailing itself like a reptile<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The sea-wolves on the coast of Canada, which some call <HI>sea calves,</HI> are as large as big dogs. They keep almost perpe∣tu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly in the water, never removing to any distance from the margin of the sea. These animals rather crawl than walk; for, when out of the water, they only slide along the sand or mud.—The females bring forth their young upon rocks or small islands. They live upon fishes, and are fond of cold countries; <HI>Voyage de la Hontan, tom. 2. p.</HI> 45. “The seals are as big as calves, the head of them like a dog, therefore called by the Dutch the <HI>sea bounds.</HI> Under each shoulder grows a long thick fin: These serve them to swim with when in the sea, and are instead of legs to them when on the land for raising their bodies up on end, by the help of these fins or stumps, and so having their tail-parts drawn close under them, they rebound as it were, and throw their bodies forward, drawing their hinder parts after them; and then again rising up, and springing forward with their fore parts alternately, they lie tumbling thus up and down, all the while they are moving on land;” <HI>Dampier's voyage, p.</HI> 89.</NOTE>. This motion must
be painful; for his body being unable to bend
in the form of an arch, like the serpents, in or∣der
to obtain different points of support, and to
advance by means of the reaction of the ground,
the seal would remain fixed in the same place,
were it not for his hands and tail, which he at∣taches
to whatever he can lay hold of, and uses
them with such dexterity, that he mounts very
quickly upon a high shore, upon a rock, and even
upon a board of ice, though slippery and steep<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The sea-calves have very sharp teeth, with which they cut a stick as thick as a man's arm.

<P>The seals live in society, or, at least, great
numbers of them frequent the same places. The
north is their natural climate, though they can
live in the temperate zones, and even in warm
climates; for we find some of them upon the
coasts of almost every European sea, not exclu∣ding
the Mediterranean. They are likewise seen
in the southern seas of Africa and America<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The sea-calves are frequent in the northern parts of Eu∣rope and America, and in the southern parts of Africa, as a∣bout the Cape of Good Hope, and at the Streights of Magel∣lan: And though I never saw any in the West Indies, but in the Bay of Campeachy, at certain islands called the Alcera∣nes, and at others called the Deserts; yet they are over all the American coasts of the South Seas, from Terra del Fue∣go, up to the Equinoctial line; but to the north of the E∣quinox again, in these seas, I never saw any, till as far as 21 north lat.

<PB N="337" REF="405"/>
several varieties. We have seen one which seem∣ed
to differ in the proportions of its body from
the common kind; for its neck was shorter, its
body longer, and its claws larger. But these
differences are not sufficient to constitute a di∣stinct
species. The second is the seal of the Me∣diterranean
and southern seas, which we presume
to be the <HI>phoca</HI> of the antients, and a distinct
species; for it differs from the others by the
quality of its hair, which is flowing and almost
black, while that of the common kind is gray
and coarse. It differs still more in the form of
the teeth and ears; for it has a kind of small ex∣ternal
ear, which the other wants: Its cutting
teeth also terminate in two points, while those
of the other are smooth and sharp edged, like
those of the dog, wolf, and other quadrupeds. Its
arms are likewise placed lower or more behind.
These discrepances, however, are perhaps only
varieties depending on the climate, and not
specific differences; especially as, in places where
the seals abound, we find them larger and smal∣ler,

<P>It was from a conformity which, at first view,
might appear slight, joined to some fugitive re∣lations,
that we judged this second or little seal
to be the phoca of the antients. We have been
assured, that the individual in our possession was
brought from India; and it is very probable that
it came from the Levant. It was an adult; for it
wanted no teeth. Its size was at least a fifth part
less than that of the full grown seals in our seas,
and two-thirds less than those in the frozen sea;
for it exceeded not two feet three inches in length,
<PB N="339" REF="407"/>
while that described by Mr Parsons, though not
an adult, as it wanted several teeth, was seven
feet and a half. Now, the characters which
the antients ascribe to their <HI>phoca</HI> correspond
not with an animal of such magnitude, but ap∣ply
to this small seal, which they frequently
compare to the beaver and otter, animals that
never can be compared with the large seals of
the north. There is another relation, which,
though false in its object, could never be attribu∣ted
to our seals, or to those of the northern seas.
The antients, when treating of the <HI>phoca,</HI> tell
us, that its hair waves, and, from a natural sym∣pathy,
follows the motions of the sea; that it
lies backward when the tide ebbs, and forward
when it flows<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pelles eorum etiam detractas corpori sensum aequorum retinere tradunt, semper aestu maris recedente inhorrescere; <HI>Plin. hist. nat. lib. 9. cap.</HI> 13.—Severinus asserts, that he saw this wonderful appearance; but he expresses it with such ex∣aggeration as destroys its credibility. When the north wind blows, says he, the hairs which had been raised by the south wind, fall down so close, that they seem to disappear; <HI>Mem. pour servir à l'hist. des animaux, part. 1. p.</HI> 193.</NOTE>; and that this singular effect
continues long after the skin has been separated
from the animal. Now, this quality could ne∣ver
have been imagined with regard to our seals
or those of the north; because the hair of both
is short and stiff. But it agrees, in some mea∣sure,
with the small seal, whose hair is waving,
and much longer and suppler than that of the
other kinds. In general, seals of the southern
<PB N="340" REF="408"/>
have finer and softer hair than those of the nor∣thern
seas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At the island of Juan Fernandes, the sea-calves have a fur so fine, and so short, that I have seen nothing equal to it elsewhere; <HI>Dampier, vol. 1. p.</HI> 118.</NOTE>. Besides, Cardan affirms positively<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Carden de subtilitate, lib. 10.</NOTE>,
that this quality, which had been considered as
fabulous, is found to be real in the Indies.
Without giving more faith to Cardan's assertion
than it deserves, it at least shows, that this qua∣lity
is peculiar to the Indian seal. Perhaps the
appearance, if it exists, is electrical; and both
antients and moderns, being ignorant of the
cause, have ascribed the effect to the ebbing and
flowing of the sea. But, however this matter
stands, the reasons already given are sufficient
to found a presumption that the small seal is the
<HI>phoca</HI> of the antients. It is likewise probable
that it is the same with Rondeletius's <HI>Me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iter∣ranean
seal</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rondelet. de piscibus, lib. 16.</NOTE>, which, he remarks, has a body
proportionally longer and thinner than the seal
of the ocean. The large seal, of which Mr Par∣sons
has given a figure and description, and
which was probably brought from the nor∣thern
seas, seems to be a species distinct from
the other two; for, though so young as to
have hardly any teeth, it was more than dou∣ble

The figures given by Aldrovandus, Johnston, and others, being profiles, lead us into two errors: 1st, They make a cubit in the fore limb, which is not visible in any shape, from the surface of the body: And, 2dly, make the posterior parts terminate in two fins, which, on the contrary, are actually webbed feet, like those of water fowl, consisting of five toes, each having three articulations, and ending with nails of a darkish colour. The nails of the fore paws are very considerable, being, like the paws of a mole, contrived for crawling upon land, and part∣ly for swimming, by a narrower web between each toe; but the hinder feet are extensive webs, serving alone to drive or row the creature in the waters... The animal, which was a female, died yesterday morning, <HI>Feb.</HI> 16. and the <HI>viscera</HI> were as follows: The stomachs, intestines, bladder, kidneys, ureters, diaphragm, lungs, great blood-vessels, and <HI>pudenda,</HI> were like those of a cow. The hairs of the whiskers are very long and clear. The spleen was two feet long, four inches broad, and very thin. The liver consisted of six lobes, each hanging as long and lank as the spleen, with a very small gall-bladder. The heart was long and flabby in its contexture in general; having a large <HI>foramen ovale,</HI> and very great <HI>columnae carnosae.</HI> In the lower stomach were about four pounds weight of slinty pebbles, of which these I have the honour to lay before you are part: all which are sharp and angular, as if the ani∣mal chose them of that form for cutting the food.—The uterus is of the horned kind, each <HI>cornu</HI> being considerably thicker than the body, or duct leading to them.—The <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>varia</HI> are very large, being granulated on the surface with the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>va,</HI> under a very thin membrane; and the opening into the tubes leading to the <HI>cornua</HI> is a great hole. I have an∣nexed a drawing of this part—as well as of the animal itself, which is thought perfectly like the original. The animal is viviparous, and suckles its young by the mamillae, like qua∣drupeds, and its flesh is carnous and muscular. This was very young, though seven feet and a half in length, having scarce any teeth, and having four holes regularly placed about the navel; <HI>Phil. Trans. No. 469. p.</HI> 383.</NOTE>, have said a
great deal concerning this animal in a few words.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="410"/>
From what has been remarked, it appears,
that there are three distinct species of the seal:
The small black seal of India and the Levant,
the common seal of our seas, and the large seal
of the northern ocean. To the first of which,
all that the antients have written concerning the
<HI>phoca</HI> must be referred. Aristotle knew this a∣nimal;
for he tells us, that it is of an ambigu∣ous
nature, an intermediate creature between a∣quatic
and terrestrial animals; that it is an im∣perfect
quadruped; that it has no external ears,
but only two conspicuous auditory passages;
and that it has a forked tongue, paps for suck∣ling,
and a small tail like that of the stag. But
he seems to have been deceived when he says,
that this animal has no gall-bladder. Mr Par∣sons,
indeed, acknowledges, that the gall-blad∣der
of the larger seal he has described was very
small. M. Daubenton, however, found, in our
seal, which he dissected, that the gall-bladder was
proportioned to the size of the liver; and the
<PB N="343" REF="411"/>
Gentlemen of the Academy found a gall-blad∣der
in the seal they describe; but mention not
that it was remarkable small.</P>
<P>Aristotle, besides, could have no knowledge of
the large seals produced in the frozen sea; be∣cause,
in his time, the whole north of Europe
and of Asia were entirely unknown. The Greeks,
and even the Romans, regarded France and Ger∣many
as their north. The Greeks, particularly,
knew none of the animals peculiar to these coun∣tries.
Hence Aristotle, who mentions the <HI>phoca</HI>
as a common animal, can mean nothing else than
the Mediterranean seal.</P>
<P>These three animals, though different in spe∣cies,
have many common properties, and ought
to be regarded as of the same nature. The fe∣males
bring forth in winter, and place their young
upon a bank of sand, a rock, or a small island.
They sit on their hind legs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The seals have two sins on each side the rump, which serve instead of a tail in the sea; and, on land, they sit on them, when they give suck to their young; <HI>Dampier, vol. 1. p.</HI> 82.</NOTE>, to allow their young
to suck; and they continue to nourish them in
this manner during twelve or fifteen days, with∣out
removing them from the place of their birth.
After which the mother carries them to the sea,
and learns them to swim and to search for food.
When fatigued, she places them on her back.
As every litter consists only of two or three, her
cares are not much divided, and their education
<PB N="344" REF="412"/>
is soon completed. Besides, nature has bestow∣ed
on these animals uncommon sagacity and sen∣timent.
When assistance is necessary, they un∣derstand
and mutually aid one another. The
young know their mother in the midst of a nu∣merous
troop. They distinguish her voice, and,
when she calls, they never fail to come<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dampier, vol. 1. p. 89.</NOTE>. We
know not the period of gestation; but, if we
judge of it from that of the growth, the duration
of life, and the magnitude of the animal, it must
be several months: It is some years before they
acquire their full growth, and the duration of
their life must be proportionally long. I am
even inclined to believe that they live longer than
is generally imagined, perhaps above a hundred
years; for the cetaceous animals live much long∣er
than the quadrupeds; and, as the seal is the
intermediate link between both, it ought to par∣take
of the nature of the former, and, of course,
enjoy life longer than the latter.</P>
<P>The voice of the seal has been compared to
the barking of a hoarse dog: When young, it
is clearer, and resembles the mewing of a cat.
The young, when carried off from the mother,
mew continually, and sometimes die of hunger
rather than take the food that is offered to them.
The old seals bark at those who strike them, and
use every effort to bite and avenge themselves.
In general, they are not very timid, and even
show marks of courage. Instead of being afraid
<PB N="345" REF="413"/>
at lightening, or thunder, they seem to be en∣tertained
with it. During a tempest, they leave
the water, and even the ice, to avoid the shock
of the waves; and they come upon the land to
amuse themselves with the storm, and to receive
the rain, of which they are exceedingly fond.
They have naturally a disagreeable smell, which
is felt at a great distance, when numbers of them
are collected in one place. When pursued, they
frequently void their excrements, which are yel∣low,
and diffuse an abominable odour. They
have a great quantity of blood; and, as they are
likewise loaded with fat, they are heavy and
sluggish. They sleep much, and very sound<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nullum animal graviore somno premitur. Pinnis qui∣bus in mari utuntur, humi quoque pedum vice serpunt; sur∣sum deorsumque claudicantium more se moventes... Capi∣tur dormiens vitulus marinus, praesertim humano mucrone, quia profundissime dormit; <HI>Ol. Magn. de Gent. sept. p.</HI> 165.</NOTE>.
They love to sleep in the sun, upon boards of
ice, and upon rocks; and they may be approach∣ed
without wakening them. This is the most
common mode of seizing them. They are sel∣dom
shot, because, though the ball enters their
head, they do not die suddenly, but spring into
the water, and the hunter loses them. As they
may be approached very near when asleep, or
when at a distance from the sea, their motion
being slow, they are assaulted with clubs and
poles. They are very robust and tenacious of
life. “They die not easily,” a traveller remarks;
<PB N="346" REF="414"/>
for, though mortally wounded, their blood al∣most
entirely exhausted, and their skin taken
off, they still live; and it is frightful to see
them, in this condition, weltering in their
blood. We killed one which was eight feet
long: After skinning it, and taking out most
of the fat, notwithstanding all the blows it had
received on the head and muzzle, it still endea∣voured
to bite, and even seized a cutlass with
nearly as much vigour as if it had not been
wounded. We afterwards thrust a sword a∣cross
the heart and liver, from which there is∣sued
as great a quantity of blood as comes
from an ox;'” <HI>Recueil des Voyages du Nord,

This animal abounds on the Magellanic coasts,
and at the island of Juan Fernandez in the South
Sea. These sea lions resemble the seal, which is
likewise very common in the same latitudes;
but they are much larger. When they have ac∣quired
their full growth, they are from eleven to
eighteen feet long, and from seven or eight to
eleven feet in circumference. They are so fat,
that, after piercing the skin, which is an inch
thick, there is at least a foot of blubber, before
arriving at the flesh: One of them will yield five
hundred pints of oil. They are, at the same
time, very full of blood, which springs with
great force when the animal is deeply wounded.
Upon cutting the throat of an individual, two
hogsheads of blood were collected, besides what
remained in the vessels of the body. Their skin
is covered with short hair, of a clear tawny co∣lour;
but their tail and feet are blackish. Their
<PB N="349" REF="417"/>
toes are united by a membrane, which extends
not to their extremity, and each of them is ter∣minated
by a claw. They differ from the com∣mon
seals, not only in magnitude, but in other
characters. The males have a kind of large
crest, or trunk, which hangs from the end of the
upper jaw to the length of five or six inches.
This part is wanting in the females, which, be∣side
their being much smaller, at once distin∣guishes
them from the males. Each male car∣ries
about with him a troop of females, and al∣lows
no other male to approach. These animals
are truly amphibious. They pass the summer
in the sea, and the winter upon land. In this
last season, the females bring forth, and produce
but one or two at a time, which they suckle. A
new born sea lion is as large as a full grown
common seal.</P>
<P>During all the time the sea lions are upon
land, they feed upon the herbage which grows
on the banks of running waters. When not
pasturing, they sleep in the mire. They are
very indolent; and it is difficult to waken them:
But they have the precaution of stationing males
as sentinels round the places where they sleep;
and those sentinels are said to give warning when
danger approaches. Their cries are loud and of
various tones. Sometimes they grunt like hogs,
and sometimes snort like horses. The males of∣ten
quarrel about the females, and inflict dread∣ful
wounds with their teeth. The flesh of these
<PB N="350" REF="418"/>
animals is tolerable food; the tongue, par∣ticularly,
is equally good with that of an ox. It
is very easy to kill them; for they can neither
fly nor defend themselves. They are so un∣wieldy,
that they can hardly move or turn them∣selves.
A person has only to take care not to
come too near their teeth, which are very strong,
and with which they inflict mortal wounds.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anson's voyage round the world.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From other observations, compared with the
former, and from some conclusions to be dedu∣ced
from them, it appears that these sea lions,
which are found in the southern point of Ame∣rica,
appear again, with little variety, on the
northern coasts of the same Continent. The large
seals of Canada, mentioned by Denis under the
denomination of <HI>sea wolves,</HI> and which he di∣stinguishes
from the common seals, may be of
the same species with the sea lions. Their young,
this author remarks, when brought forth, are
thicker and longer than the largest hog. Now,
it is certain, that the seals of our ocean, though
full grown, are never of this size. The Medi∣terranean
seal, or the <HI>phoca</HI> of the antients, is
still less. There remain only the seals described
by Parsons, whose magnitude corresponds with
those of Denis<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">To the testimony of Denis, we may still add that of P. Chr. Leclerg: “Upon the coasts of North America, there are sea wolves, some of which are as large as horses and oxen. These sea wolves are called <HI>Ouaspous;'” Relation de la Gaspesie, p.</HI> 490.</NOTE>. Parsons does not mention the
<PB N="351" REF="419"/>
sea where this large seal was found. But, whe∣ther
it came from the North of Europe or from
America, it might be the same with the sea
wolf of Denis, and the sea lion of Anson; be∣cause
its size is the same, since, though it had
not nearly acquired its full growth, it was seven
feet long. Besides, the most remarkable differ∣ence,
next to that of magnitude, between the
sea lion and the seal, is a large crest which the
male of the former has upon the upper jaw; but
the female has no such crest. Parsons did not
see the male. He described the female only,
which had no crest, and perfectly resem∣bled
the female sea lion of Anson. To these
similarities, Parsons adds another, which is still
more remarkable: He tells us, that his seal had
the stomachs and intestines of a cow; and, at
the same time, the author of Anson's voyages
says, that the sea lion feeds upon herbage during
the whole summer. Hence it is extremely pro∣bable,
that the structure of these two animals is
the same, or rather that they are the same ani∣mals,
and very different from the other seals,
who have but one stomach, and feed upon fishes.</P>
<P>Woods Rogers had mentioned, before the au∣thor
of Anson's voyage, these sea lions on the
coasts of South America, and describes them a
little differently: “The sea lion,” he remarks,
is a very strange creature, and of a prodigious
size. I have seen some of them above twenty
feet long, and could not weigh less than four
thousand pounds. Others were sixteen feet
<PB N="352" REF="420"/>
in length, and might weigh about two thou∣sand
pounds. The quantity of oil they yield∣ed
was amazing. The figure of their body
approaches to that of the sea calf; but their
skin is thicker than that of an ox. The hair
is short and coarse, the head disproportionally
large, and the mouth remarkably big: The
eyes are of a monstrous size. The muzzle re∣sembles
that of a lion, with terrible whiskers,
the hairs of which are so stiff that they may
serve for tooth-picks. About the end of the
month of June, these animals repair to the
island of Juan Fernandez, in order to produce
their young, which they deposit about a gun∣shot
from the margin of the sea. There they
remain till the end of September, without mo∣ving
out of the place, and without taking any
nourishment; at least, we never saw them eat.
I observed some of them continue eight days
in the same spot, and would not have aban∣doned
it, if we had not frighted them.....
At the island of Lobos, on the coast of Peru,
we saw some sea lions, and a greater number
of seals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage round the world by Woods Rogers.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>These observations of Woods Rogers, which
correspond very well with those of the author
of Anson's voyage, seem still farther to prove,
that the sea lions feed upon herbage when they
are on land; for it is by no means probable, that
they pass three months without taking any nou∣rishment,
especially when suckling their young.
<PB N="353" REF="421"/>
In the collection of voyages to the South Sea,
there are many remarks concerning these ani∣mals:
But neither the facts nor descriptions ap∣pear
to be exact. For example, it is said, that,
in Magellan's straits<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Navigation aux Terres Australes, tom. 1. p. 168.</NOTE>, there are sea wolves so
large, that their skin, when extended, was thirty-six
feet wide; which is unquestionably an ex∣aggeration.
We are also told, that, in the two
islands of Port Desire, these animals resemble
lions in the anterior part of their body, having
the head, neck, and shoulders garnished with a
very long bushy mane<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Idem, tom. 1. p. 221.</NOTE>. This is still a greater
exaggeration; for the sea lions have only a little
more hair on the neck than on the rest of the
body; but this hair exceeds not an inch in
length<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hist. du Paraguay, par le P. Charlevoix, tom. 6 p. 181.</NOTE>. It is farther remarked, that some of
these animals are more than eighteen feet long;
that many of them are only fourteen feet; and
that, generally, they exceed not five<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Navigations aux Terres Australes, tom 2. p. 11.</NOTE>. This
account would lead us to believe that there are
two species, the one much larger than the other;
because the author does not inform us whether
this difference was owing to the difference of
their ages, which, however, was necessary to
prevent error. “These animals,” says Coreal<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Coreal, tom. 2. p. 180.</NOTE>,
keep their mouths always open: Two men
are hardly able to kill one of them with a
<PB N="354" REF="422"/>
spear, which is the best weapon to use against
them. The female suckles four or five young,
and drives away any other young ones which
approach her: From this circumstance I con∣cluded
that the females bring forth four or five
at a litter.” This conjecture seems to be well
founded; for the seal described by Mr Parsons
had four paps, situated in such a manner as to
form a square, in the centre of which the navel
is placed. I thought it proper to collect all the
facts relative to these animals, which are very
little known. It were to be wished that some
sensible traveller would furnish us with a proper
description of them, and particularly of their in∣ternal
parts, as the stomach, intestines, &amp;c. for,
if the testimony of voyagers could be relied on,
we would believe that the sea lions belong to
the class of ruminating animals; that they have
several stomachs; and, consequently, that their
species is far removed from that of the seal, or
sea calf, which certainly has but one stomach,
and ought to be ranked with the carnivorous
tribes.</P>

<P>THE denomination of <HI>sea cow,</HI> under which
the walrus is most generally known, has been
<PB N="355" REF="423"/>
ill applied<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The name <HI>sea cow,</HI> as well as <HI>sea calf,</HI> has perhaps been derived from this circumstance, that the walrus and seal some∣times cry like the lowing of a cow or calf: “Ipsis,” says Pliny, speaking of the seals, “in somno mugitus, unde nomen vitu∣li;” <HI>lib. 9. cap.</HI> 13.</NOTE>; for the animal it denotes has
no resemblance to a cow. The name <HI>sea ele∣phant,</HI>
which others have given it, is better ima∣gined,
because it is founded on a conspicuous
character: The walrus, like the elephant, has
two large ivory tusks which proceed from the
upper jaw; and its head, if it had a trunk, would
<PB N="356" REF="424"/>
have a great resemblance to that of the elephant.
The walrus not only wants this instrument,
which serves the elephant for an arm and hand,
but it has not the use of its arms and legs, which,
as in the seals, are inclosed within the skin, the
hands and feet being alone free. The body is
long, swelled before, narrow behind, and every
where covered with short hair. The fingers of
the hands and feet are enveloped in a membrane,
and terminated by sharp, short claws. Thick
hairs, in the form of whiskers, surround the
mouth. The tongue is furrowed. It has no
external ears; so that the walrus, if we except
the two large tusks which change the form of
the head, and the want of cutting teeth both a∣bove
and below, resembles the seal in every o∣ther
article: It is only much larger and stronger.
The largest seals exceed not seven or eight feet.
The walrus is generally twelve; and some of
them are sixteen feet long, and eight or nine in
circumference. Both animals inhabit the same
seas, and are almost always found together.
They have many common habits: They live
equally in water or on land: They both climb
upon boards of ice: They suckle and manage
their young in the same manner: They live on
the same food, and associate in large troops.
But the species of the walrus is not so much
diversified as that of the seal. Neither does it
stray to such distances, but is more attached to
its proper climate; for it is seldom seen any
<PB N="357" REF="425"/>
where but in the northern seas. Hence the an∣tients
were acquainted with the seal, but had no
knowledge of the walrus.</P>
<P>This animal is mentioned by most voyagers
who have frequented the northern seas of Asia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We find the tusks of the walrus in the environs of No∣va Zembla, and in all the islands, as far as the Oby. They are said to be frequent about Jeniski, and they were seen for∣merly as far as Pjasida. We again meet with them at Scha∣laginskoi, and among the Schuktschii, where they are very large.... It is probable that these animals are very nume∣rous from this place to the river Anadir; for all the tusks sold at Jakutzk are brought from Anadirskoi. They are likewise found in Hudson's straits, where they are a Russian ell in length, and as thick as a man's arm. Their ivory is equally good with that of the elephant's tusks; <HI>Voyage du Nord, tom. 6. p.</HI> 7.—At Jakutzk, I saw some teeth of the walrus which were a Russian ell and a quarter, and others an ell and a half in length. They are commonly broader than thick, and are about four inches wide at the base... I never heard, that, in the neighbourhood of Anadirskoi, the walrus was hunted or fished to procure its teeth, which come there in such numbers. On the contrary, I was assured, that the inhabitants found these teeth on the low shores, detached from the animal; and, consequently, that there was no occa∣sion for killing the creatures... I have frequently been asked, whether the walrus of Anadirskoi was a different species from that found in the west passage of the frozen sea, because the teeth brought from the east coast are much larger than those which come from the west... It appears that the walrus of Greenland, and that on the west of the frozen sea, have no communication with those found to the east of Kolima, about the point of Schalaginskoi, and, still farther, near Anadirskoi. Neither do those of Hudson's bay seem to join those of Tschuktschi.... It is universally agreed, however, that the walrus of Anadirskoi differs neither in size nor figure from that of Greenland, &amp;c.; <HI>Voyage de Gmelin en Siberie, tom. 3. p. 148.—Note.</HI> M. Gmelin has not resolved this question, though I think it may be answered in a satisfactory manner. He remarks, that these animals are neither hunted at Anadir∣skoi, nor on the eastern part of the frozen sea; and, conse∣quently, no teeth are brought thither but those of the crea∣tures who die a natural death: Of course, it is not surprising, that teeth, which have acquired their full growth, should be larger than those of the Greenland walrus, which is often killed when young.</NOTE>,

<P>“In Horisont and Klock bays, the walrus and
seals were formerly very numerous; but few
of them now remain..... During the heat
of summer, both of them resort to the neigh∣bouring
plains, and are sometimes seen in
troops of one or two hundred, particularly the
walrus, who can continue there for several
days running, till hunger forces him back to
the sea. These animals have a great resem∣blance
to the seal; but they are stronger and
larger. Like the seal, they have five toes or
<PB N="359" REF="427"/>
pats; but their claws are shorter, and their head
thicker, rounder, and stronger. The skin
of the walrus, especially about the neck, is an
inch thick, wrinkled, and covered with very
short hair of various colours. His upper jaw
is armed with two tusks of half an ell, or an ell,
in length, which are hollow at the root, and
grow larger as the animal advances in years.
They are sometimes observed to have but one
tusk, having lost the other by fighting, or by
age. This ivory is generally clearer than that
of the elephant; because it is harder and more
compact. The mouth of the walrus resem∣bles
that of an ox, and is garnished above and
below with hollow, pointed hairs, about the
thickness of a straw. Above the mouth are
two nostrils, through which these animals
blow the water, like the whale, without, how∣ever,
making much noise. Their eyes are
sparkling, red, and inflamed during the heats
of summer; and, as they cannot then endure
the impression made by the salt water on their
eyes, they continue more willingly on the
land in summer than at any other time....
They are very numerous about Spitzbergen...
They are killed on land with lances... They
are hunted on account of the profit derived
from their teeth and grease. Their oil is near∣ly
as much esteemed as that of the whale.
Their teeth are of more value than the whole
oil they yield. The internal part of the teeth,
<PB N="360" REF="428"/>
especially when large, the substance of which
is harder and more compact than that of the
smaller ones, is more precious than ivory.
When a pound of the smaller kind is sold for
a florin, a pound of the large brings three,
four, and often five florins. A middle sized
tooth weighs three pounds.... and an or∣dinary
walrus furnishes half a ton of oil.
Hence the whole animal brings thirty-six
florins, eighteen for the two teeth, and as
much for the oil.... Formerly, vast troops
of these animals were found on land. But
our vessels, which go annually to the whale
fishery, have so terrified them, that they have
retired to the most sequestered places, and that
those who remain never venture upon land in
troops, but continue in the water, or dispersed
among the boards of ice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The number of these animals must be greatly reduced, or rather, most of them have retired to unknown coasts; for we find, in the collection of voyages to the north, that, in the year 1704, near Cherry island, in the latitude of 65 de∣grees 45 minutes, the crew of an English vessel fell in with a prodigious number of these creatures, all lying near each o∣ther; that, out of more than a thousand, of which this troop consisted, the sailors killed only fifteen; but that they found as many teeth as filled a ton—that, on the 13th of July, they killed a hundred more, of which they carried off only the teeth—that, in 1706, another English crew killed seven or eight hundred in six hours; in 1708, more than nine hun∣dred in seven hours; in 1710, eight hundred in a few days; and that a single man slew forty with a spear.</NOTE>. When a walrus
is met with upon the ice, or in the water, a
<PB N="361" REF="429"/>
strong harpoon is darted at him, which not
unfrequently slips upon the thick, hard, skin.
But, when pierced, the animal is dragged with
a cable toward the helm of the boat, is
slain with a strong spear made for the purpose,
and afterwards brought to the nearest shore,
or to a flat board of ice. He is generally
heavier than an ox. The fishers begin with
taking off his skin, which, being of no value,
is thrown away<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zorgdrager seems to have been ignorant that a very good leather is made of this skin. I have seen strong coach braces made of it. Anderson, after Other, says, that girths, and ropes for boats, are also made of this skin; <HI>Hist, of Green∣land, tom. 2. p.</HI> 160.</NOTE>. With a hatchet, they se∣parate
the two teeth from the head; or, to
prevent the teeth from damage, they cut off
the head, and boil it in a cauldron. The
blubber is afterwards cut into long slices, and
carried to the ship.... It is equally difficult
to follow the walrus by rowing as the whale,
and the harpoon is often darted in vain; because
the whale is more easily pierced, and the har∣poon
does not so readily slip... The walrus is
often struck three times with a strong, sharp
spear, before his hard, thick skin is pierced.
It is necessary, therefore, to strike him in a
place where the skin is well stretched. For
this reason, the fishers aim at the eyes of the
animal, which obliges it to turn its head, and
<PB N="362" REF="430"/>
stretch the skin of the throat or breast. Then
the blow is given in this place, and the spear
is quickly retracted, to prevent the creature
from seizing it with his teeth, and wounding
his assailant, either with his teeth, or even with
the spear, which sometimes happens. The at∣tack
upon a small board of ice never lasts long;
because the walrus, whether wounded or not,
throws himself quickly into the water; and,
therefore, attacking him upon land is always
preferred.... These animals are only found
in unfrequented places, as in the island of
Moffen, behind Worland, in the lands sur∣rounding
Horisont and Klock bays, in retired
plains, and banks of sand, where vessels rarely
approach. Even those which are there met
with, instructed by the persecutions they have
suffered, are so much on their guard, that they
keep always near the water, to facilitate their
retreat. This fact I experienced on the large
bank of sand behind Worland, called <HI>Rif,</HI>
where I fell in with a troop of thirty or forty.
Some of them were on the very margin of
the water, and others at no great distance from
it. We stopped some hours, without landing,
in the hopes that they would advance farther
into the plain. But, as this stratagem did not
succeed, we landed with two boats to the
right and left of them. Almost the whole of
them were in the water the moment we put
<PB N="363" REF="431"/>
our feet on the land; so that our hunting was
confined to the wounding of a few, which
likewise instantly darted into the sea......
Before being persecuted, these animals advan∣ced
far upon land; so that, in high tides, they
were at a great distance from the water; and,
when the tide ebbed, the distance being in∣creased,
they were easily assailed..... We
marched in front of these animals to cut off
their retreat from the sea. They saw all these
preparations without betraying any symptoms
of fear; and each hunter often killed one of
them, before it could regain the water. We
made a barrier of the dead carcasses, and left
some of our men in ambush to slay those
which remained. We sometimes killed three
or four hundred..... From the prodigious
quantity of teeth scattered over the ground,
it is obvious that these animals must have for∣merly
been very numerous...... When
wounded, they become furious, striking from
one side to the other with their teeth. They
break the arms, or drive them out of the
hands of their assailants; and, at last, burning
with rage, they place their head between their
paws, or fins, and allow themselves to tumble
into the sea.... When very numerous, they
grow so audacious, that, in order to secure
one another, they surround the boats, and
endeavour to overset them, by striking or
piercing the planks with their teeth.... In
<PB N="364" REF="432"/>
fine, this elephant of the sea, before he became
acquainted with men, was afraid of no ene∣my;
because he had learned to conquer the
rapacious Greenland bear, which may be
ranked among the number of sea-robbers.”</P>
<P>By adding to Zorgdrager's remarks those
which are to be found in the Collection of Voy∣ages
to the North<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The sea horse (<HI>walrus</HI>) resembles the sea calf (<HI>seal</HI>), ex∣cept that he is much larger; for he is of the size of an ox. His paws, both before and behind, like those of the sea calf, have five toes; but the claws are shorter. His head is like∣wise larger, rounder, and harder, than that of the sea calf. His skin, especially about the neck, is a full inch thick. Some of them are covered with mouse-coloured hair, and others have very little hair. They are generally so infested with scabs and excoriations, that one would imagine they had been flayed, especially about the joints, where the skin is much wrinkled. In the upper jaw they have two large tusks, which sometimes exceed two feet in length. The young ones have no tusks; but they grow as the animals advance in years... These tusks are more esteemed than the finest ivory; they are solid within, but hollow at the roots.. The opening of their mouth is as large as that of an ox; and, both above and be∣low the lips, there are several bristles, which are hollow with∣in; and as thick as a straw... Above the whiskers, there are semicircular nostrils, through which they throw out water, like the whale, but with much less noise. Their eyes are situated high above the nose, and they are as red as blood. Their ears are not far from their eyes, and resemble those of the seal. Their tongue is at least as large as that of an ox.—Their neck is so thick, that it is with difficulty they can turn their head, which obliges them to move their eyes al∣most continually. Their tail is short, like that of the seal. Their grease is not so easily removed as in the seals, because it is interlarded with flesh.—Their penis consists of a hard bone, about two feet long, which tapers toward the point, and is a little bended in the middle. Very near the belly, the penis is flat; but, beyond that, it is round, and co∣vered with sinews.—These animals, it is probable, live up∣on herbs and fishes: Their dung resembles that of a horse.—When they dive, like the seals, they plunge their head first into the water. They sleep and snore, not only on the ice, but in the water; so that they frequently have the appear∣ance of being dead. They are bold and furious, and defend each other to the last drop of their blood.—They exert every effort to relieve those which are taken. They assault the boat on all sides, biting and bellowing in a hideous man∣ner; and if, by means of their number, they oblige the enemy to fly, they pursue the boat till they lose sight of it.—They are hunted solely for the sake of their teeth; but, out of a hundred, perhaps not above one tooth is found to be good; because some of them are too young, and others have spoiled teeth; <HI>Recueil des voyages du Nord, tom. 2. p.</HI> 117.</NOTE>, and others that are scatter∣ed
<PB N="365" REF="433"/>
in different relations, we shall have a pretty
complete history of this animal. The species
seems to have formerly been much more diffu∣sed
than at present. They were found in the
seas of the temperate zones, in the gulf of Cana∣da
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the latitude of 49 degrees, 40 minutes, there are three small islands in the gulf of St Laurence, upon one of which vast numbers of a certain species of seal come ashore. This animal, which, I believe, was unknown to the antients, is called <HI>walrus</HI> by the Flemyngs, and <HI>morse</HI> by the English, who have adopted its Russian name. It is an amphibious and a monstrous creature, and sometimes surpasses the Flanders oxen in thickness. Its hair resembles that of the seal.—They have two tusks bended downward, which are a cubit in length, and used for the same purposes as ivory, and bring an equal price; <HI>Descript. des Indes Occidentales, par de Laët, p.</HI> 41.—Upon the coasts of North America, there are sea cows, o∣therwise called <HI>beasts with the long teeth;</HI> because they have two large tusks, about a cubit in length, and their other teeth are four inches long. No ivory can be finer. These animals are found on Sable island; <HI>Descript. de l'Amerique Septent. par Denis, tom. 2. p.</HI> 257.</NOTE>, upon the coasts of Acadia, &amp;c. But they
<PB N="366" REF="434"/>
are now confined to the seas of the frozen zones;
and, even there, they are very scarce in places
which are much frequented. There are few of
them in the frozen seas of Europe, and still
fewer in those of Greenland, Davis's straits, and
other parts of North America; because, on ac∣count
of the whale fishery, they have been long
disturbed and hunted. From the end of the
sixteenth century, the inhabitants of St Malo
went to the Ramée islands in quest of the wal∣ruses,
which were then very numerous<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descript. des Indes Occidentales, par de Laët, p. 42.</NOTE>. It
is not a hundred years since the merchants of
Port-Royal in Canada sent barks to Cape Sable
and Cape Fourchu to hunt these animals<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Descript. de l'Amerique Septent. par Denis, tom. 1. p. 66.</NOTE>,
which have some time ago forsaken these lati∣tudes,
as well as those of the European seas;
for they are now found in considerable numbers
only in the frozen sea of Asia, from the mouth
of the Oby to the most eastern point of that
Continent, the coasts of which are very little
frequented. They are rarely seen in the tem∣perate
seas. The species found under the Tor∣rid
Zone, and in the Indian ocean, is very dif∣ferent
from our northern walrus. The latter
<PB N="367" REF="435"/>
seem to dread either the heat or the saltness of
southern seas; and, as they have never traver∣sed
these seas, they are not found toward the
South pole, though we see there the large and
small seals of the North, which are even more
numerous than in our Arctic regions.</P>
<P>The walrus, however, can live at least some
time in a temperate climate. Edward Worst
tells us, that he saw one of these animals alive
in England, which was three months old; that
it was put into water, for a short time only,
each day; and that it crawled upon the ground.
He does not say that it was incommoded by
the heat of the air, but, on the contrary, that,
when touched, it had the aspect of a furious
and robust animal, and that it respired strongly
through the nose. This young walrus was of the
size of a calf, and had a great resemblance to
the seal. Its head was round, it eyes large, and
its nostrils flat and black, which it opened and
shut at pleasure. It had no ears, but only two
auditory passages. The opening of the mouth
was not large; and the upper jaw was garnish∣ed
with whiskers consisting of coarse, thick,
cartilaginous hairs. The under jaw was trian∣gular,
the tongue thick and short, and the inside
of the mouth fortified on each side with flat
teeth. Both the fore and hind feet were broad,
and the hind part of the body was perfectly si∣milar
to that of the seal. This hind part crawl∣ed,
rather than walked. The fore feet turned
<PB N="368" REF="436"/>
forward, and those behind backward. They
were all divided into five toes, covered with a
strong membrane...... The skin was thick,
hard, and covered with short delicate hair, of
an ash-colour. This animal grunted like a wild
boar, and sometimes cried with a strong, deep
voice. It was brought from Nova Zembla, and
had not yet acquired the two large tusks; but,
on the upper jaw, the knobs from which they
were to spring were visible. It was fed with
boiled oats or millet, which it rather slowly
sucked than eat. It sprung with fury at its ma∣ster,
and made a growling noise. It followed
him, however, when he presented meat to it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descript. des Indes Occidentales, par de Laët, p. 41.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This account, which gives a tolerably just
idea of the walrus, demonstrates, at the same
time, that it can live in a temperate climate.
Nevertheless, it does not appear that it could
endure great heat, or has ever frequented the
southern seas, so as to pass from the one pole
to the other. Several voyagers mention sea
cows which they have seen in India; but these
belong to a different species: That of the wal∣rus
is always easily distinguished by its long
tusks, which no other animal has, except the
elephant. This production is an effect rarely
exhibited in Nature; for, of all the terrestrial
and amphibious animals, the elephant and wal∣rus,
in which alone it appears, are solitary
<PB N="369" REF="437"/>
species, and constitute distinct and undivided
genera.</P>
<P>We are assured that the walruses couple not
in the manner of quadrupeds, but backward.
The male, like the whales, has a large bone in
the penis. The females bring forth in winter
upon the land, or upon boards of ice, and ge∣nerally
produce but one young at a time, which,
when born, is as large as a hog of an year old.
We are ignorant of the period of gestation;
but, to judge of it from that of the growth, as
well as the magnitude of the animal, it ought
to be more than nine months. The walruses can∣not
remain always in the water; but are obli∣ged
to come upon land, either to suckle their
young, or for other purposes. When under the
necessity of climbing steep shores, or boards of
ice, they use their teeth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These teeth are not entirely round and smooth, but ra∣ther flat and slightly-furrowed. The right tooth is commonly somewhat longer and stronger than the left.—I have had two of them, each of which was two feet and an inch long, and eight inches in circumference at the base; <HI>Anderson's Nat. Hist. of Greenland.</HI></NOTE> and hands as hooks
to drag along the unwieldy mass of their bodies.
It is alledged, that they feed upon shell fishes,
which adhere to the bottom of the sea; and
that they use their tusks to disengage them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nat. hist. of Greenland, p. 162.</NOTE>.
Others affirm<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Descript. des Indes Occidentales, par de Laët, p. 42.</NOTE>, that they live upon a certain
sea-herb with broad leaves, and that they nei∣ther
<PB N="370" REF="438"/>
eat flesh nor fish. But I believe none of
these to be true. The walrus, it is probable,
lives upon prey, like the seal, and particularly
on herrings and small fishes; for he eats none
upon land, which obliges him to return to the
sea in quest of food.</P>

This character cannot apply to the manati, but agrees very well with the animal under consideration, of which we have a head.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>The dugon is an animal of the African and
East Indian seas, of which we have seen two
heads, that have a greater resemblance to that
of the walrus than to any other animal. Its
head is deformed nearly in the same manner
by the depth of the sockets from which the
two tusks in the upper jaw spring. They are
half a foot long, and are rather large cut∣ting
teeth than tusks. They extend not direct∣ly
<PB N="371" REF="439"/>
out of the mouth, like those of the walrus;
but are much shorter and more slender. Besides,
they are situated in the fore part of the jaw,
and very near each other, like cutting teeth.
But, between the tusks of the walrus, there is
a considerable interval; and they are not situated
at the point, but at the side of the upper jaw.
The grinders of the dugon differ likewise in
number, position, and figure, from those of the
walrus. From all which we must conclude,
that the dugon is a distinct species. Several
voyagers have confounded it with the sea lion.
Innigo de Biervillas says, that a sea lion was
killed at the Cape of Good Hope, which was
ten feet long, and four thick. Its head re∣sembled
that of a calf of one year old. Its eyes
were hideous, and its ears short; and it had a
bristly beard, broad feet, and legs so short, that
its belly touched the ground. He adds, that it
had two tusks which issued half a foot out of
the mouth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage d'Innigo Biervillas, part 1. p. 38.</NOTE>. This last character corresponds
not with the sea lion, which has no tusks,
but teeth like those of the seal. From this cir∣cumstance
I concluded, that it was not a sea lion,
but the animal to which we have given the
name of <HI>dugon.</HI> Other travellers seem to have
pointed it out under the denomination of the
<HI>sea bear.</HI> Spilberg and Mandelslo relate, “that,
at the island of St Elisabeth, on the African
coast, there are animals which should rather
<PB N="372" REF="440"/>
be called <HI>sea bears</HI> than sea wolves; because,
by their hair, their colour, and their head,
they have a greater resemblance to the bear,
only the muzzle is sharper; that they resem∣ble
the bear still more in their manner of
moving, except in the movement of the hind
legs, which are only trailed; that these am∣phibious
creatures have a terrible aspect, fly
not from man, and bite with such force as to
break the shaft of a javelin; and that, though
denied the use of their hind legs, they fail not
to run with such swiftness that it is difficult
for a man to overtake them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Premier voyage de Spilberg, tom. 2. p. 437. Voyages de Mandelslo, tom. 2. p. 551.</NOTE>.” Guat tells
us, “That he saw, at the Cape of Good Hope,
a sea cow of a reddish colour. It had a
thick round body, large eyes, long tusks,
and a muzzle a little turned up. He adds,
that he was assured by a mariner, that this a∣nimal,
of which he could see the fore part
only, as it was in the water, had feet<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Le Guat, tom 1. p. 36.</NOTE>.” This
sea cow of Guat, the sea bear of Spilberg, and
the sea lion of Biervillas, appear to be the same
animal with the dugon, whose head was sent to
us from the Isle of France, and which, conse∣quently,
exists in the southern seas, from the
Cape of Good Hope to the Philippine islands<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">I could see from my house, which was situated on a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ock in the island of Lethy, the turtles at some fathoms deep in the water. I one day saw two large <HI>dugungs,</HI> or <HI>sea cows,</HI> which approached near the rock. I instantly informed my fisher, to whom I showed the two animals, which were moving about and eating a green moss that grows on the shore. He ran for his companions, who soon brought a boat to the place. During this time, the male came in quest of the fe∣male, and, being unwilling to leave her, allowed himself to be slain also. Each of these prodigious fishes was more than six ells long. The male was a little larger than the female. Their heads resembled that of an ox. <HI>They had two large teeth, a span in length and an inch thick,</HI> which protruded out of the jaw, like those of the wild bear. These teeth were as white as the finest ivory. The female had two breasts, like a wo∣man; and the male organs of generation resembled those of a man. The intestines were like those of a cow, and the flesh had nearly the same taste; <HI>Voyage de Christopher Barchewitz, p. 381. Note.</HI> This description corresponds very well with the manati, except the teeth. The manati has neither tusks nor cutting teeth; for which reason I conjecture that this dugung was not the manati, but the animal under consideration.</NOTE>.
<PB N="373" REF="441"/>
Besides, we cannot be certain that this animal,
which has some resemblance to the walrus in
the head and tusks, has four feet. We only
presume from analogy, and the testimony of
travellers, that it has these members. But, as
the analogy is not very great, and the testimony
of travellers not sufficiently explicit, we shall
suspend our judgment on this subject, till we
receive better information.</P>

<HEAD>THE MANATI<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The manati has pinniform fore legs; hind parts ending in a tail, horizontally flat. These animals are of an enormous size; some of them are twenty-eight feet long, and eight thousand pounds in weight. The head, in proportion to the bulk of the animal, is small, oblong, and almost square. The nostrils are filled with short bristles. The gape, or <HI>rictus,</HI> is small. The lips are double. Near the junction of the two jaws, the mouth is full of white tubular bristles, which serve the same use as the laminae of whales, to prevent the food from running out with the water. The lips are also full of bristles, which serve instead of teeth to cut the strong roots of the sea plants, which, floating ashore, are a sign of the vici∣nity of these animals. In the mouth are no teeth, only two flat white bones, one in each jaw, one above, another below, with undulated surfaces, which serve instead of grinders. The eyes are extremely small, not larger than those of a sheep. The iris is black. It is destitute of ears, having only two o∣rifices, so small that a quill will scarce enter them. The tongue is pointed, and but small. The neck is thick, and its junction with the head scarce distinguishable; and the last al∣ways hangs down. The circumference of the body near the shoulders is twelve feet, about the belly twenty, near the tail only four feet eight; the head thirty-one inches; the neck near seven feet: And, from these measurements, may be col∣lected the deformity of this animal. Near the shoulders are two feet, or rather fins, which are only two feet two inches long, and have neither fingers nor nails; beneath they are concave, and covered with hard bristles. The tail is thick, strong, and horizontal, ending in a stiff black fin, and like the substance of whalebone, and much split in the fore part; the end slightly divided.</P>
<P>The skin is very thick, black, and full of inequalities, like the bark of oak, and so hard as scarce to be cut with an ax, and has no hair on it. Beneath the skin, is a thick blubber, which tastes like oil of almonds. The flesh is coarser than beef, and will not soon putrify. The young ones taste like veal. The skin is used for shoes, and for covering the sides of boats; <HI>Pennant's synops. of quad. p.</HI> 355.</P>

<P>IN the animal kingdom, the terrestrial tribes
commence where the fishes terminate. The
<PB N="375" REF="443"/>
Manati, which is neither a quadruped nor a
whale, retains the two fore feet, or rather hands,
of the former. But the hind legs, which, in
the seal and walrus, are almost entirely included
<PB N="376" REF="444"/>
within the body, and very much contracted, are
totally obliterated in the manati. Instead of two
short feet and a still shorter tail, which the wal∣rus
carries in a horizontal direction, the manati
has only a large tail, which spreads out like a
fan, in the same direction; so that, at first
sight, the tail of the former seems to be divided
into three, and that, in the latter, these three
parts appear to be united into one. But, from
a more attentive observation, and particularly
from dissection, it appears, that no such union
takes place; that there is not a vestige of thigh-bones
and legs; and that the bones which com∣pose
the tail of the manati are simple vertebrae,
similar to those of the cetaceous animals, who
have no feet. Hence those animals are ceta∣ceous
by the hind part of their bodies, and are
only allied to the quadrupeds by the two fore∣feet
or hands on each side of their breast. Ovi∣edo
seems to be the first author who has given
a kind of history and description of the manati:
“This animal,” he remarks, “is pretty frequent
on the coasts of St Domingo. He is very
large, and of a deformed figure, with a head
thicker than that of an ox, small eyes, and two
feet or hands near the head, which serve him
for swimming. He has no scales, but is co∣vered
with a very thick skin. He is a very
gentle creature. He rises on the waves and
eats the herbage on the shore, which he can
reach without coming out of the water. He
<PB N="377" REF="445"/>
generally swims on the surface. In order to
seize him, the people endeavour to approach
him with a boat, and then dart at him a large
arrow, fixed to a very long rope. As soon as
he feels himself wounded, he runs off with
the arrow and rope, to the extremity of which
a large piece of cork or wood is tied, to serve
as a buoy, that they may discover his route.
When the animal is exhausted by the wound
and loss of blood, he approaches the land.
They then lay hold of the end of the rope, and
coil it up, till only a few fathoms remain. By
the aid of the waves, he is gradually brought
to land, or they kill him in the water with
spears. His weight is so great, that a carriage
drawn with two oxen is necessary to transport
him. His flesh is excellent, and, when fresh,
is preferred to beef or fish. When cut into
pieces and pickled, it in time acquires the taste
of the tunny fish, and, in this state, it is most
highly relished. Some of these animals are
more than fifteen feet long by six in thickness.
The hind part of the body is much thinner,
and tapers toward the tail, which again spreads
out at the extremity. As the Spaniards call
the fore feet of all quadrupeds <HI>hands,</HI> and as
this animal has only two fore feet, they have
denominated it the <HI>manati,</HI> or the <HI>animal with
hands.</HI> He has no external ears, but only two
apertures through which he hears. On his
skin there are only a few scattered hairs; it is
<PB N="378" REF="446"/>
of an ash-colour, and an inch thick. Soles of
shoes, belts, &amp;c. are made of it. The female
has two paps on her breast, and generally brings
forth two young, which she suckles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ferdin. Oviedo, hist. Ind. Occid. lib. 13. cap. 10.</NOTE>.” All
these facts related by Oviedo are true; and it is
singular, that Cieça<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Chron. Peruv. cap. 31.</NOTE>, and several subsequent
writers, should affirm, that the manati comes of∣ten
out of the water to pasture on the land.
They have been led into this from the analogy
of the walrus and seals, which frequently quit
the water, and continue for some time on the
land. But it is certain that the manati never
leaves the water, and that he prefers fresh wa∣ter
to salt.</P>
<P>Clusius measured the skin of one of these a∣nimals,
and found it to be sixteen feet and a
half long, and seven feet and a half broad; the
two feet or hands, were large, and armed with
short claws. Gomara<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Fr. Lopes de Gomara, hist. gen. cap. 31.</NOTE> assures us, that he some∣times
found them of twenty feet in length; and
adds, that they frequent the rivers as well as the
sea. He relates, that a young manati was rear∣ed
in a lake in the island of St Domingo during
twenty-six years; that he was so gentle and
tame, that he took peaceably the food which
was presented to him; that he knew his name,
and, when called upon, came out of the wa∣ter,
and crawled to the house to receive his
<PB N="379" REF="447"/>
victuals; that he seemed to be pleased with the
human voice, and the chanting of children;
that he had no fear; that he allowed the boys
to sit on his back, and carried them from one
end of the lake to the other, without plunging
them into the water, or doing them any injury.
This relation cannot be true in all its circum∣stances:
It seems to be accommodated to the fa∣ble
of the antients concerning the dolphin; for
the manati is unable to crawl on the ground.</P>
<P>Herrera says very little on this subject: He
only assures us, that, though very large, the ma∣nati
swims easily, makes no noise in the water,
and dives when he hears any distant sound<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descript. des Indes Occident. par Herrera, p. 57.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Hernandes, who gives two figures of the ma∣nati,
the one in profile and the other in front,
hardly adds any thing to what had been said by
former Spanish authors. He only remarks, that
both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, as well as
the lakes, produce a deformed animal, called
<HI>Manati,</HI> the description of which he copies al∣most
entirely from Oviedo; and then adds, that
the hands of this animal have five nails, like
those of man; that it has a large navel and a∣nus;
that the vulva resembles that of a woman;
that the penis is like that of a horse; that the
flesh and grease are similar to those of a fat hog;
that the ribs and viscera resemble those of a bull;
that they couple on land, the female lying on
her back; and that they produce but one young,
<PB N="380" REF="448"/>
which is of a monstrous size the moment it is
brought forth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hernand. hist. Mex. p. 324.</NOTE>. The copulation of these ani∣mals
cannot take place on land, because they
are unable to walk; but it is performed in shal∣low
water. Binet<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voyage en l'isle de Cayenne, par Antoine Binet, p. 346.</NOTE> remarks, that the manati
is of the size of an ox, and as round as a ton;
that he has a small head, and very small tail;
that his skin is as coarse and thick as that of the
elephant; that some of them are so large as to
yield more than six hundred pounds of excel∣lent
meat; that his grease is as mild as butter;
that he delights in the mouths of rivers, where
he browses the herbs which grow on the banks;
that, in certain places, about ten or twelve
leagues from Cayenne, they are so numerous,
that a vessel may be filled with them in one day,
by expert harpooneers. Father Tertre, who gives
a long account of the fishing of the manati, a∣grees
almost in every article with the authors
we have quoted. He remarks, however, that
this animal has only four toes and four claws
on each hand; and adds, that he feeds upon a
small sea-herb, which he browses in the same
manner as an ox; and that, after being satiated
with this food, he searches for the rivers and
fresh waters, where he browses twice a day;
that, when his belly is full, he sleeps with his
muzzle half out of the water, which makes him
observable at a distance; that the female brings
<PB N="381" REF="449"/>
forth two young, which follow her every where;
and that, when the mother is taken, we are cer∣tain
likewise of having the young, who never
depart from her, even when dead, but go per∣petually
round the vessel which carries her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. gen. des Antilles, par le P. du Tertre.</NOTE>.
This last fact appears to be very suspicious:
It is contradicted by other voyagers, who assure
us, that the manati produces but one at a time.
As all large quadrupeds, and the whale tribes,
produce one young only, analogy alone should
prevent us from believing that the manati al∣ways
brings forth two. Oexmelin remarks,
that the tail of the manati is placed horizontally,
like that of the cetaceous animals, and not ver∣tically,
like that of other fishes; that it has
no fore teeth, but only a kind of callosity as
hard as a bone, with which it cuts the herbage;
that it has thirty-two grinders; that it does not
see well, on account of the smallness of its eyes,
which secrete very little humour, and have no
iris; that its brain is small; that, to supply the
defect of good eyes, it has an excellent ear; that
it has no tongue; that the organs of generation
resemble those of man and woman more than
any other animal; that the milk of the females,
which he had tasted, is very good; that they
produce but a single young one, which they em∣brace
and carry with their hands; that the mo∣ther
suckles it during a whole year, after which
it is in a condition to eat herbage, and provide
<PB N="382" REF="450"/>
for its own safety; that, from the neck to the
tail, this animal has fifty-two vertebrae; that
it feeds like the turtle, but can neither walk nor
crawl on the ground<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. des Avanturiers, par Oexmelin, tom. 12▪ p. 134.</NOTE>. All these facts are pretty
exact, and even that of the fifty-two vertebrae;
for M. Daubenton, in the foetus which he dis∣sected,
found twenty-eight vertebrae in the tail,
sixteen in the back, and six, or rather seven, in
the neck. This voyager is only deceived with
regard to the tongue, which is not wanting in
the manati. It is indeed fixed, almost to its ex∣tremity,
to the under jaw. In the voyage to the
American islands, we find a very good descrip∣tion
of the manati, and the manner in which it
is harpooned. The principal facts mentioned
by this author correspond with those already
quoted: But he remarks, “That, since the coasts
have been inhabited, this animal has become
exceedingly rare in the Antilles; and that the
one he saw and measured was fourteen feet
nine inches from the muzzle to the origin of
the tail. The whole body was round. The
head was thick, and the mouth large, with
great lips, and some long coarse hairs about
them. The eyes were very small in propor∣tion
to the head; and the ears were only two
small apertures. The neck is very thick and
short; and, were it not for a small movement
which makes it wrinkle, it would be impossible
to distinguish the head from the body. Some
<PB N="383" REF="451"/>
authors pretend,” he adds, “that this animal
uses its two hands or fins for dragging itself
along the ground. I made a particular inquiry
concerning this fact. But no person had ever
seen the animal on land; and it is impossible
that it should either walk or crawl, the fore
feet, or hands, serving only to hold its young
when sucking. The female has two paps,
which I measured, and found each of them to
be seven inches in diameter, by about four of
elevation. The teat was an inch thick. The
body was eight feet two inches in circumfe∣rence.
The tail was like a large pallet, nine∣teen
inches in length, fifteen inches broad at
the widest part, and about three inches thick at
the extremity. The skin of the back was
double the thickness of an ox's hide, but much
thinner on the belly. It is of a brown slate
colour, and of a coarse grain, with thick and
pretty long hairs of the same colour, thin∣ly
scattered over the body. This manati weigh∣ed
about eight hundred pounds. Along with
the mother, the young one was taken, which
was nearly three feet long. A part of the tail
was roasted on a spit, and we found it to be as
good and delicate as veal. The herb upon
which these animals feed is from eight to ten
inches long, narrow, pointed, tender, and of a
beautiful green colour. In some places, this
herb is so abundant, that the bottom of the
sea has the appearance of a meadow. The
<PB N="384" REF="452"/>
turtles likewise feed upon it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nouv. Voy. aux isles de l'Amerique, tom. 2. p. 200.</NOTE>,” &amp;c. Father
Magnin de Fribourg says, that the manati eats
such grass as he can reach without coming out
of the water..... That its eyes are about the
size of a filberd; that its ears are so narrow as
hardly to admit a probe; that, within the ears,
there are two small perforated bones; that the
Indians hang these bones to their neck as a trin∣ket....
Its cry resembles the lowing of cow<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Extrait d'un MS. du Pere Magnin de Fribourg.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Father Gumilla relates, that there are immense
numbers of the manati in the great lakes of the
Oronoko: “Each of these animals,” says he,
“weighs from six to seven hundred pounds.
They feed upon herbs. Their eyes are very
small, and the auditory passages still smaller.
When the river is low, they come to pasture
on its margin. The female always brings
forth two young, which she carries at her paps,
and holds them so firm with her two hands,
that they never separate, whatever movement
she makes. The young, when new born,
weight<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> each of them, thirty pounds. The
milk of the female is very thick. Below the
skin, which is much thicker than that of an ox,
we find four strata, or layers; two of them
consist of fat, and the other two of very ten∣der,
savory flesh, which, when roasted, has
the flavour of pork and the taste of veal. These
animals, when rain is about to fall, spring out
<PB N="385" REF="453"/>
of the water to a considerable height<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. de l'Orenoque, par le P. Gumilla.</NOTE>.” Both
Gumilla and Tertre seem to be deceived, when
they assert that the females produce two young at
a time: For it is almost certain, as formerly re∣marked,
that they bring forth one only.</P>
<P>In fine, M. de la Condamine, who obligingly
communicated to me a drawing of the manati,
made by himself, on the river of the Amazons,
gives a more perfect account of the manners of
this animal than any other author. “Its flesh and
fat,” he remarks, “are analogous to those of
veal: Father Acuna renders the resemblance
still more complete, by bestowing horns on it,
which Nature never provided. It is not, pro∣perly
speaking, amphibious; for it cannot go
entirely out of the water, having only, near
the head, two flat sins, in the form of wings,
about sixteen inches long, which serve it for
arms and hands: He only advances his head
out of the water, in order to reach the grass
upon the shore. The one of which I drew a
figure was a female. Its length was seven
feet and a half, and its greatest width two feet.
I have since seen them much larger. The eyes
of this animal have no proportion to the size
of its body; they are round, and only three
lines in diameter. The auditory passages are
still smaller, and appear only like pin holes.
The manati is not peculiar to the river of the
Amazons, but is equally common in the Oro∣noko.
<PB N="386" REF="454"/>
It is also found, though not so fre∣quently,
in the Oyapoc, and in several other
rivers in the neighbourhood of Cayenne, and
on the coasts of Guiana, and probably else∣where.
This is the same animal which was
formerly called <HI>manati,</HI> and now <HI>lamantin,</HI> at
Cayenne, and in our American islands; but I
believe the species is somewhat different. They
are never met with in the high seas, and are
even rare in the mouths of rivers. But they
are found, at more than a thousand leagues
from the sea, in most of the large rivers which
fall into that of the Amazons, as in the Gual∣laga,
the Pastaca, &amp;c. In ascending the river of
the Amazons, they are stopped by the Pongo
(cataract) of Borja, above which they never
appear<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage sur la rivière des Amazones, par M. de la Con∣damine, p. 154. Mem. de l'Acad. des sciences, 1745. p. 464.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>I have now given a concise account of all that
is known concerning the manati. It were to be
wished that some of the inhabitants of Cayenne,
among whom there are several persons well ac∣quainted
with natural history, would examine
this animal, and give us a description of its in∣ternal
parts, particularly those of respiration, of
digestion, and of generation. It appears, but we
are by no means certain, that there is a large
bone in the penis, and a foramen ovale in the
heart; that the lungs are singularly construct∣ed;
<PB N="387" REF="455"/>
and that it has several stomachs, as in the
ruminating animals.</P>
<P>Besides, the species of the manati is not con∣sined
to the seas and rivers of the New World,
but seems likewise to exist on the coasts and in
the rivers of Africa. M. Adanson saw manatis
in Senegal, from which he brought one of their
heads and gave it to me; and, at the same time,
he obliged me with a description of this animal,
which he made on the spot, and which I here
insert in his own words. “I saw many of these
animals. The largest exceeded not eight feet
long, and weighed about eight hundred pounds.
A female of five feet three inches in length,
weighed only a hundred and ninety-four
pounds. They are of a blackish ash-colour.
There are hairs thinly scattered over the whole
body, in the form of bristles, and are nine lines
long. The head is conical, and of a middling
size, in proportion to that of the body. The
eyes are round and very small. The iris is of a
deep blue colour, and the pupil black. The
muzzle is almost cylindrical; the two jaws are
nearly of an equal size, and the lips are thick
and fleshy. It has no teeth but grinders in
either jaw. The tongue is of an oval form,
and attached, almost as far as the point, to
the under jaw. It is singular, that almost all
authors and travellers have given ears to this
animal. I could not discover, in any of them,
<PB N="388" REF="456"/>
a hole sufficient even to admit a small probe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is certain, however, that this animal has external au∣ditory passages. M. de la Condamine informed me, that he had seen and measured them, and that they exceeded not half a line in diameter. As the manati has the power of con∣tracting or shutting them, it is probable that they had escaped the observation of M. Adanson, especially as those passages are very small, even when the animal keeps them open.</NOTE>.
He has two arms or fins, situated at the ori∣gin
of the head, which is not distinguishable
from the trunk by any kind of neck, or by
shoulders that are perceptible. These arms
are nearly cylindrical, and consist of three
principal articulations; the anterior one forms
a kind of flat hand, in which the toes are on∣ly
to be distinguished by four claws of a
shining reddish brown colour. The tail is
horizontal, like that of the whale; and it has
the figure of a baker's shovel. The female
has two paps, rather elliptic than round, and
situated near the pits of the arms. The skin
is half an inch thick on the belly, nine lines
on the back, and an inch and a half on the
head. The fat is white, and two or three
inches thick. The flesh is of a pale red colour,
and more delicate than veal. The Jalofe Ne∣groes
call this animal <HI>Lereou.</HI> It lives upon
herbage, and is found in the mouth of the
river Niger.”</P>
<P>From this description, it is obvious, that the
manati of Senegal differs not from that of
Cayenne; and, from a comparison made by M.
<PB N="389" REF="457"/>

that of a foetus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This foetus was sent to us by M. le Chevalier Turgot, governour of Guiana.</NOTE> of the Cayenne lamantin, he
presumes that they are of the same species.
The testimonies of travellers<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Oexmelin relates, that there are lamantins on the coasts of Africa, and that they are more frequent on the Senegal coast than in the river Gambia; <HI>Hist. des Avanturiers, tom. 2. p.</HI> 115. Guat assures us, that he saw many of these animals off the island of Rodrigue. The head of the lamantin of this island, he remarks, resembles that of a hog, except that the snout is not so sharp. The large lamantins are about twenty feet in length.—This animal has warm blood, a coarse, hard, blackish skin, with some thinly scattered hairs on it, small eyes, and two holes, which it opens and shuts, and may be properly called its <HI>ears.</HI> As it often retracts its tongue, which is not large, several authors have imagined that it had none. It has grinders, but no cutting teeth; and its gums are sufficiently hard to enable it to browse herbage.—I never saw above one young along with the females, which inclines me to think that they bring forth one only at a time.—We sometimes found three or four hundred of these ani∣mals together. They feed upon a kind of herb which grows in the bottom of the sea. They were so gentle, that we of∣ten felt them, in order to select the fattest. We passed a rope under their tail to pull them out of the water. We never seized the largest, because they would have cost us too much labour: Besides, their flesh is not so delicate as that of the young.—We never observed this animal on land, where I suspect it could not crawl; and I believe that it is not amphibious; <HI>Voyage de le Guat, tom. 1. p.</HI> 93.</NOTE> correspond with
our opinion: That of Dampier, in particular,
is positive, and his remarks merit insertion:
“While we lay here, our Muskito men went in
their canoe, and struck us some manatee, or
sea cow. Besides this Blewfield's river, I have
<PB N="390" REF="458"/>
seen of the manatee in the bay of Compeachy,
on the coasts of Bocca del Drago, and Bocco
del Toro, in the river of Darien, and among
the South Keys, or little islands of Cuba. I
have heard of there being found on the North
of Jamaica a few, and in the rivers of Suri∣nam
in great multitudes, which is a very low
land. I have seen of them also at Mindanea,
one of the Philippine islands, and on the coast
of New Holland.... The manatee delights
to live in brackish water; and they are com∣monly
in creeks and rivers near the sea. It is
for this reason, possibly, they are not seen in
the South seas, that ever I could observe,
where the coast is generally a bold shore, that
is, high land, and deep water close home by
it, with a high sea or great surges, except in
the bay of Panama; yet even there is no ma∣natee.
Whereas the West Indies, being, as it
were, one great bay composed of many smal∣ler,
are mostly low land and shoal water, and
afford proper pasture, as I may say, for the
manatee. Sometimes we find them in salt
water, sometimes in fresh, but never fat at
sea. And those that live in the sea at such
places where there is no river nor creek fit for
them to enter, yet do commonly come once or
twice in twenty-four hours to the mouth of
any fresh water river that is near their place
of abode. They live on grass seven or eight
inches long, and of a narrow blade, which

grows in the sea in many places, especially a∣mong
islands near the main. This grass grow∣eth
likewise in creeks, or in great rivers near
the sides of them, in such places where there
is but little tide or current. They never come
ashore, nor into shallower water than where
they can swim. Their flesh is white, both
the fat and the lean, and extraordinary sweet
wholesome meat. The tail of a young cow
is most esteemed; but, if old, both head and
tail are very tough. A calf that sucks is the
most delicate meat; privateers commonly roast
them, as they do also great pieces cut out of
the bellies of the old ones.”</P>

<HEAD>OF THE DEGENERATION
OF ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>WHENEVER man began to change his
climate, and to migrate from one coun∣try
to another, his nature was subjected to va∣rious
alterations. In temperate countries, which
we suppose to be adjacent to the place where he
was originally produced, these alterations have
been slight; but they augmented in proportion
as he receded from this station: And, after
many ages had elapsed; after he had traversed
whole continents, and intermixed with races
already degenerated by the influence of different
climates; after he was habituated to the scorch∣ing
heats of the South, and the frozen regions
of the North; the changes he underwent be∣came
so great and so conspicuous, as to give
room for suspecting, that the Negro, the Lap∣lander,
and the White, were really different
species, if, on the one hand, we were not cer∣tain,
that only one man was originally created,
and, on the other, that the White, the Laplan∣der,
and the Negro, are capable of uniting, and
of propagating the great and undivided family
of the human kind. Hence those marks which
distinguish men who inhabit different regions of
<PB N="393" REF="465"/>
the earth, are not original, but purely superficial.
It is the same identical being who is varnished
with black under the Torrid Zone, and tawned
and contracted by extreme cold under the Polar
Circle. This circumstance is alone sufficient to de∣monstrate,
that the nature of man is endowed with
greater strength, extension, and flexibility, than
that of any other terrestrial being; for vegetables,
and almost all the animals, are con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined to par∣ticular
soils and climates. This extension of our
nature depends more on the qualities of the
mind than those of the body. It is by the mind
that man has been enabled to find those resources
which the delicacy of his body required, to brave
the inclemency of the sky, and to conquer the
rigidity and barrenness of the earth. He may
be said to have subdued the elements: By an
exertion of his intellect, he produced the ele∣ment
of fire, which had no existence on the sur∣face
of the earth. His sagacity taught him how
to clothe his body, and to build houses for
defending himself against every external attack.
By the powers of genius he supplied all the qua∣lities
which are wanting in matter. Without
possessing the strength, the magnitude, or the
robustness of most animals, he knew how to
conquer, to tame, and to confine them: He
made himself master of those regions which
Nature seemed to have resigned to them as an
exclusive possession.</P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="466"/>
The earth is divided into two great Continents
The antiquity of this division exceeds that of all
human monuments; and yet man is more antient;
for he is the same in both worlds. The Asiatic, the
European, and the Negro, produce equally with
the American. Nothing can be a stronger proof
that they belong to the same family, than the
facility with which they unite to the common
stock. The blood is different; but the germ is
the same. The skin, the hair, the features, and
the stature, have varied, without any change in
the internal structure. The type is general and
common: And if, by any great revolution, man
were forced to abandon those climates which he
had invaded, and to return to his native coun∣try,
he would, in the progress of time, resume
his original features, his primitive stature, and
his natural colour. But the mixture of races
would produce this effect much sooner. A
white male with a black female, or a black male
with a white female, equally produce a mulat∣to,
whose colour is brown, or a mixture of
black and white. This mulatoo intermixing
with a white, produces a second mulatto less
brown than the former; and, if the second
mulatto unites with a white, the third will have
only a slight shade of brown, which will entire∣ly
vanish in future generations. Hence, by this
mixture, 150, or 200 years, are sufficient to
bleach the skin of a Negro. But, to produce the
same effect by the influence of climate alone,
<PB N="395" REF="467"/>
many centuries would perhaps be necessary.
Since the Negroes were transported to America,
which is about two hundred years ago, the Ne∣gro
families, who have preserved themselves
from mixture, seem not to have lost any shade
of their original colour. The climate of South
America, it is true, being sufficiently hot to tawn
its inhabitants, we ought not to be surprised
that the Negroes there continue black. To put
the change of colour in the human species to the
test of experiment, some Negroes should be
transported from Senegal to Denmark, where
the inhabitants have generally white skins, golden
locks, and blue eyes, and where the difference
of blood and opposition of colour are greatest.
These Negroes must be confined to their own
females, and all crossing of the breed scrupu∣lously
prevented. This is the only method of
discovering the time necessary to change a Ne∣gro
into a White, or a White into a Black, by
the mere operation of climate.</P>
<P>This is the greatest alteration that climate has
produced in man, and yet it is only super<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icial.
The colour of the skin, hair, and eyes, varies
by the influence of climate alone. The other
changes, such as those of stature, figure, features,
and quality of the hair, seem to require the joint
operations of climate and other causes; for, in
the Negro race, who have generally crisped wool
instead of hair, a flat nose, and thick lips, there
are whole nations with long hair and regular
<PB N="396" REF="468"/>
features: And, in the race of Whites, if we
compare the Dane to the Calmuck Tartar, or e∣ven
the Finlander to the Laplander, whose na∣tions
are contiguous, we shall find among them
as great a difference in features and size as takes
place among the Negroes. To produce such al∣terations,
therefore, which are deeper than the
former, some other causes must concur with the
influence of climate. The most direct and ge∣neral
cause is the quality of the food. It is
chiefly by aliment that man receives the influ∣ence
of the soil which he inhabits: That of the
air and climate acts more superficially. While
the climate changes the colour of the skin, food
acts upon the internal form by its qualities,
which are always related to those of the earth
by which it is produced. Even in the same
country, we see striking differences between those
who occupy the heights and those who inhabit
the low grounds. The inhabitants of the moun∣tains
are always better made, more vivacious,
and more beautiful than those of the vallies.
Hence, in countries remote from the original
climate, where the herbs, fruits, grains, and the
flesh of animals differ both in quality and sub∣stance,
the men who feed upon these articles
must undergo still greater changes. These im∣pressions
are not suddenly made. A considera∣ble
time is necessary before man receives the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inge peculiar to the climate, and still more before
the soil communicates to him its qualities. It re∣quires
<PB N="397" REF="469"/>
ages, joined to the constant use of the same
food, to change the features, the size of the bo∣dy,
and the substance of the hair, and to produce
those internal alterations which, when perpetua∣ted
by generation, become general and perma∣nent
characteristics which distinguish the dif∣rent
races and nations who compose the agree∣gate
of the human species.</P>
<P>In brute animals, these effects are greater and
more suddenly accomplished; because they are
more nearly allied to the earth than man; because
their food being more uniformly the same, and
nowise prepared, its qualities are more decided,
and its influence stronger; and because the ani∣mals,
being unable to clothe themselves, or to
use the element of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire, remain perpetually ex∣posed
to the action of the air, and all the incle∣mencies
of the climate. For this reason, each
of them, according to its nature, has chosen its
zone and its country: For the same reason, they
remain there, and, instead of dispersing them∣selves,
like man, they generally continue in those
places which are most friendly to their constitu∣tions.
And, when forced by men, or by any
revolution on the globe, to abandon their native
soil, their nature has undergone changes so great,
that, to recognise them, recourse must be had to
accurate examination, and even to experiment
and analogy. If to these natural causes of alte∣ration
in free animals, we add that of the em∣pire
of man over those which he has reduced to
<PB N="398" REF="470"/>
slavery, we will be astonished at the degree to
which tyranny can degrade and disfigure Na∣ture;
we will perceive the marks of slavery, and
the prints of her chains; and we will find, that
these wounds are deeper and more incurable, in
proportion to their antiquity; and that, in the
present condition of domestic animals, it is per∣haps
impossible to restore their primitive form,
and those attributes of nature which we have ta∣ken
from them.</P>
<P>Thus the temperature of the climate, the qua∣lity
of the food, and the evils produced by sla∣very,
are the three causes of the changes and de∣generation
of animals. The effects of each me∣rit
a separate examination; and their relations,
when viewed in detail, will exhibit a picture of
Nature in her present condition, and of what
she was before he degradation.</P>
<P>Let us compare our pitiful sheep with the
mouflon from whom they derived their origin.
The mouflon is a large animal. He is fleet as
a stag, armed with horns and thick hoofs, co∣vered
with coarse hair, and dreads neither the
inclemency of the sky, nor the voracity of the
wolf. He not only escapes from his enemies by
the swiftness of his course, but he resists them
by the strength of his body, and the solidity of
the arms with which his head and feet are for∣ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied.
How different from our sheep, who sub∣sist
with difficulty in flocks, who are unable to
defend themselves by their numbers, who can∣not
<PB N="399" REF="471"/>
endure the cold of our winters without shel∣ter,
and who would all perish, if man withdrew
his protection? In the warmest climates of Asia
and Africa, the mouflon, who is the common
parent of all the races of this species, appears to
be less degenerated than in any other region.
Though reduced to a domestic state, he has preser∣ved
his stature and his hair; but the size of his
horns are diminished. Of all domestic sheep,
those of Senegal and India are the largest, and
their nature has suffered least degradation. The
sheep of Barbary, Egypt, Arabia, Persia, Kal∣muck,
&amp;c. have undergone greater changes. In
relation to man, they are improved in some ar∣ticles,
and vitiated in others. But, with regard
to Nature, improvement and degeneration are
the same thing; for they both imply an altera∣tion
of original constitution. Their coarse hair
is changed into fine wool. Their tail, loaded
with a mass of fat, has acquired a magnitude so
incommodious, that the animals trail it with
pain. While swollen with superfluous matter,
and adorned with a beautiful fleece, their strength,
agility, magnitude, and arms, are diminished:
These long-tailed sheep are only half the size
of the mouflon. They can neither fly from
danger, nor resist the enemy. To preserve and
multiply the species, they require the constant
care and support of man.</P>
<P>The degeneration of the original species is
still greater in our climates. Of all the quali∣ties
<PB N="400" REF="472"/>
of the mouflon, our ewes and rams have re∣tained
nothing bnt a small portion of vivacity,
which yields to the crook of the shepherd. Ti∣midity,
weakness, resignation, and stupidity, are
the only melancholy remains of their degraded
nature. To restore their original size and
strength, our Flanders sheep should be united
with the mouflon, and prevented from propaga∣ting
with inferior races; and, if we would devote
the species to the more useful purposes of afford∣ing
us good mutton and wool, we should imi∣tate
some neighbouring nations in propagating
the Barbary race of sheep, which, after being
transported into Spain, and even into Britain,
have succeeded very well. Strength and mag∣nitude
are male attributes; plumpness and beauty
of skin are female qualities. To obtain fine
wool, therefore, our rams should have Barbary
ewes; and, to augment the size, our ewes should
be served with the male mouflon.</P>
<P>Our goats might be managed in the same man∣ner.
By intermixing them with the goat of An∣gora,
their hair might be changed, and rendered
equally useful with the finest wool. In our cli∣mate,
the species of the goat is not so much de∣generated
as that of the sheep. It appears
to be still more degenerated in the warm coun∣tries
of Africa and India. The smallest and
weakest goats are those of Guinea, Juda, &amp;c. and
<PB N="401" REF="473"/>
yet these countries produce the largest and strong∣est
sheep.</P>
<P>The species of the ox is more influenced by
nourishment than that of any other domestic
animal. In countries where the pasture is rich
and always springing, they acquire a prodigious
size. The antients gave to the oxen of Aethi∣opia,
and some other provinces of Asia, the ap∣pellation
of <HI>Elephant-bulls;</HI> because, in these
countries, they approach to the magnitude of
elephants. This effect is produced by the abun∣dance
of rich and succulent herbage. Of this our
own climate affords a proof. An ox fed on the tops
of the green mountains of Savoy or Switzerland,
acquire double the size of our oxen; and yet the
oxen in Switzerland, like ours, are fed in stables
during the greatest part of the year. The dif∣ference
arises from this circumstance, that the
Switzerland oxen are set out to free pasture as
soon as the snow melts, while ours are not per∣mitted
to enter the meadows till the hay, which
is reserved for the horses, is carried off; and,
of course, they are neither fully nor properly
nourished. It would be extremely useful to the
state, if a regulation were made for abolishing
promiscuous pasturage, and permitting inclosures.
The climate has likewise considerable influence
on the nature of the ox. In the northern re∣gions
of both Continents, he is covered with
long, soft hair, like fine wool. He has also a
large bunch on his shoulders; and this defor∣mity
<PB N="402" REF="474"/>
is common to the oxen of Asia, Africa, and
America. Those of Europe alone have no
bunch. The European oxen, however, are the
primitive race, to which the bunched kind a∣scend,
by intermixture, in the first or second ge∣neration.
What proves this race to be only a
variety of the other, is, that it is subject to very
great degradations. The differences in their
size is enormous. The small zebu of Arabia is
not one tenth part of the magnitude of the Ae∣thiopian
<HI>bull-elephant.</HI></P>
<P>In general, the influence of food is greater,
and produces more sensible effects upon those
animals which feed on herbs or fruits. Carni∣vorous
animals, on the contrary, are less affected
by this cause than by the influence of climates;
because flesh is an aliment already assimilated to
the nature of the animal that devours it. But
grass is the first product of the earth, and has
all the properties of it; and these terrestrial
qualities are immediately communicated to the
animal.</P>
<P>Thus the dog species, upon which food seems
to have a very slight influence, is more varied
than that of any other carnivorous animal. In
his degradations, he appears to follow exactly
the differences of climate. He is naked in the
warmest climates, covered with a coarse thick
hair in the northern regions, and adorned with
a fine silky robe in Spain and in Syria, where
the mild temperature of the air converts the hair
<PB N="403" REF="475"/>
of most animals into a kind of silk. But, inde∣pendent
of these external varieties, which are
produced by the influence of climate alone, the
dog is subjected to other changes that proceed
from his situation, his captivity, or from the na∣ture
of the intercourse he holds with man. The
augmentation and diminution of his size, are ef∣fects
of the attention bestowed in uniting the
largest or smallest individuals. The shortening
of the tail, muzzle, and ears, proceeds likewise
from the hand of man. Dogs who, for a few
generations, have had their ears and tail cut,
transmit these defects, in a certain propor∣tion,
to their descendents. I have seen dogs
produced without tails, which I at first appre∣hended
to be individual monsters: But I have
since learned that this race exists, and is perpe∣tuated
by generation. Pendulous ears, the most
general and most certain mark of domestic ser∣vitude,
are common to almost all dogs. Of
thirty different races, which compose the species,
only two or three have preserved their primitive
ears. The shepherd's dog, the wolf-dog, and
the dog of the North, alone, have erect ears. The
voice of these animals has likewise undergone
strange alterations. The dog seems to have be∣come
clamorous and noisy in the society of man,
who employs his tongue more than any other
being; for the dog, in a state of nature, is al∣most
mute, uttering only a kind of howling
when pressed with hunger. He acquired his
<PB N="404" REF="476"/>
faculty of barking by his commerce with men
in polished society; for, when transported to
extreme climates, and among a gross people,
such as the Laplanders or Negroes, he loses his
barking, assumes his natural howling, and be∣comes
almost perfectly mute. The dogs with e∣rect
ears, and particularly the shepherd's dog,
which is least degenerated, makes also the least
use of his voice. As he passes a solitary life in
the country, and has no intercourse but with
sheep and a few simple men, like them, he is
serious and silent, though, at the same time, ve∣ry
active and intelligent. Of all dogs, he has
fewest acquired talents, and possesses a greater
number of those which are natural. He is like∣wise
the most useful for guarding our flocks,
and for the preservation of good order. His
race ought, therefore, to be more multiplied
than those of other dogs, who minister only to
our amusements, and whose numbers are so
great, that, in every town and village, the pro∣visions
consumed by them would nourish many
families.</P>
<P>The domestic state has greatly contributed to
vary the colour of animals, which, in general,
was originally brown or black. The dog, the
ox, the goat, the sheep, the horse, have assumed
all kinds of colours. The hog has changed from
black to white; and pure white, without any
spots, seems to mark the last degree of degene∣ration,
and it is generally accompanied with es∣sential
<PB N="405" REF="477"/>
imperfections. In the race of white men,
those who are remarkably white, and whose
hair, eye-brows, beard, &amp;c. are likewise white,
have often a defect in their hearing, and, at the
same time, red and weak eyes. In the black
race, the white Negroes are still more feeble and
defective. All the quadrupeds which are abso∣lutely
white, have the same faults of dullness of
hearing and red eyes. This kind of degenera∣tion,
though more frequent among domestic a∣nimals,
sometimes appears among the wild spe∣cies,
as in those of the elephant, stags, fallow-deer,
monkeys, moles, and mice; in all of
which this colour is uniformly accompanied with
smaller or greater degrees of bodily weakness,
and bluntness of the senses.</P>
<P>But slavery seems to have made the deepest
and most conspicuous impressions on the ca∣mel.
He is brought forth with bunches on his
back, and callosities on his breast and knees.
These callosities are evidently wounds occasion∣ed
by friction; for they are filled with pus and
corrupted blood. As he never walks but under
a heavy load, the pressure of which prevents
the uniform extension and growth of the mus∣cles
of the back, and produces a swelling in
the parts adjacent, in the same manner, when
he lies down or sleeps, he is at first obliged
to rest upon his folded limbs. This posture
becomes at last habitual. For several hours
every day, the whole weight of his body is
<PB N="406" REF="478"/>
supported by his breast and knees. The skin
of those parts is rubbed off by pressing against
the earth, and they soon become callous, and
lose their organization. The lama, which, like
the camel, passes his life under a burden, and also
reposes on his breast, has similar callosities, which
are perpetuated by generation. The baboons
and monkeys, whose general posture, whether
asleep or awake, is sitting, have callosities on
their buttocks. This callous skin even adheres
to the bones against which it is continually pres∣sed
by the weight of the body. But these cal∣losities
of the baboons and monkeys are dry
and heal; because they proceed not from re∣straint,
nor from the weight of any foreign
load. They are, on the contrary, effects of
a natural habit; for those animals continue
longer in a sitting than in any other posture.
These callosities of the monkeys are similar to
the double skin on the sole of a man's foot.
This sole is a natural callosity, which our con∣stant
habit of walking or standing renders more
or less thick, according to the quantity of exer∣cise
we take.</P>
<P>The wild animals, not being under the im∣mediate
dominion of man, are not subject to
such great changes as the domestic kinds. Their
nature seems to vary with different climates;
but it is no where degraded: If they were
capable of choosing their climate and their food,
the changes they undergo would be still less.
<PB N="407" REF="479"/>
But, as they have at all times been hunted and
banished by man, or even by the strongest and
most ferocious quadrupeds, most of them have
been obliged to abandon their native country,
and to occupy lands less friendly to their con∣stitution.
Those whose nature had flexibility
enough to accommodate themselves to this new
situation, have diffused over vast territories; while
others have had no other resource than to con∣fine
themselves in the deserts adjacent to their
own country. There is no animal which, like
man, has spread over the whole surface of the
earth. A great number of species are limited
to the southern regions of the Old, and others
to the same regions of the New Continent. O∣thers,
though fewer, are confined to the nor∣thern
regions, and, instead of extending to the
south, have passed from the one Continent to
the other, by routes which are still undiscovered.
Other species inhabit only particular mountains
or vallies: And, the changes in their nature
are, in general, less sensible, the more they are
confined to a small circle.</P>
<P>As climate and food have little influence on
wild animals, and the empire of man still less,
the chief varieties amongst them proceed from
another cause. They depend on the number
of individuals of those which produce, as well
as of those that are produced. In those species
in which the male attaches himself to one fe∣male,
as in that of the roebuck, the young de∣monstrate
<PB N="408" REF="480"/>
the fidelity of their parents by their
entire resemblance to them. In those, on the
contrary, the females of which often change
the male, as in that of the stag, the varieties
are numerous: And as, through the whole
extent of Nature, there is not one individual
perfectly similar to another, the varieties among
animals are proportioned to the number and
frequency of their produce. In species, the fe∣males
of which bring forth five or six young,
three or four times a year, the number of va∣rieties
must be much <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reater than in those which
produce but a single young once a year. The
small animals, accordingly, which produce of∣tener
and in greater numbers than the larger
kinds, are subject to greater varieties. Magni∣tude
of body, which appears to be only a rela∣tive
quality, possesses positive rights in the laws
of Nature. Magnitude is as fixed as minuteness
is changeable. Of this fact we shall soon be
convinced by the following enumeration of the
varieties which take place in the large and small
animals.</P>
<P>In Guinea, the ears of the wild boar are very
long, and lie on his back. In China, his belly
is large and pendulous, and his legs are very
short. At Cape Verd, and in other places, his
tusks are very thick, and bended like the horns
of an ox. In a domestic state, and in cold or
temperate climates, his ears are half pendulous,
and his bristles are white. I reckon neither
<PB N="409" REF="481"/>
the pecari, nor the babiroussa among the varie∣ties
of the wild boar; because they belong not
to this species, though they approach nearer to
it than to any other.</P>
<P>In warm, dry, and mountainous countries,
such as Corsica and Sardinia, the stag has lost
one half of his size, his hair has become
brown, and his horns blackish. In cold and
moist countries, such as Bohemia and the Ar∣dennes,
his size is increased, his coat and horns
are almost black, and his hair is so long that it
forms a kind of beard on his chin. In North
America, the horns of the stag are extended,
and branched with crooked antlers. In a do∣mestic
state, his coat changes from yellow to
white; and, unless when at liberty, or in very
large inclosures, his limbs are deformed and
crooked. The axis is not to be reckoned among
the varieties of the stag: It approaches nearer
to that of the fallow-deer, of which, perhaps,
it is only a variety.</P>
<P>In the fallow-deer, it is difficult to ascertain
the original species. He is no where entirely
domestic nor absolutely wild. He varies indif∣ferently
from yellow to pied, and from pied to
white. His horns and tail are also larger and
longer, in different races, and his flesh is good
or bad, according to the soil and climate. Like
the stag, he is found in both Continents; and
he seems to be larger in Virginia, and other
temperate provinces of America, than in Eu∣rope.
<PB N="410" REF="482"/>
The roebuck is likewise larger in the
New than in the Old Continent. But, in o∣ther
respects, all his variations are confined to
some differences in the colour of the hair, which
changes from yellow to brown. The smallest
roebucks are generally brown, and the largest
yellow. The roebuck and fallow-deer are
the only animals common to both Continents
which are larger and stronger in the New than
in the Old World.</P>
<P>The ass, though subjected to the pressure of
the most wretched servitude, has undergone
few changes; for his nature is so obdurate, that
it equally resists bad treatment and the inconve∣niencies
of a foreign climate and of coarse food.
Though originally a native of warm countries,
he can exist and even multiply, without the as∣sistance
of man, in temperate climates. For∣merly
there were onagers, or wild asses, in all
the deserts of Asia Minor; but they are now
rare, and are numerous in the deserts of Tartary
only. The mule of Dauria<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mulus Dauricus foecundus, <HI>Czigithai</HI> Mongolorum in Dauria; <HI>Mus. Petropolitanum, p.</HI> 335.</NOTE>, called <HI>czigithai</HI>
by the Tartars, is probably the same animal with
the onager of the other Asiatic provinces. The
former differs from the latter only in the length
and colour of the hair, which, according to Mr
Bell, is undulated with brown and white<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the forests near Kuznetsky on the river Tom, one of the sources of the river Oby, in lat. 51 and 52, are wild asses. I have seen many of their skins; they have in all re∣spects the shape of the head, tail, and hoofs of the common ass; but their skin is waved and undulated white and brown; <HI>Bell's travels to China. Nota.</HI> The skins which Mr Bell saw might be those of the zebra; for other travellers alledge not that the <HI>czigithais</HI> or <HI>onagers</HI> of Dauria are striped, like the zebra, with brown and white.

These <HI>czigithais</HI> are found in the forests of Tar∣tary
as far as the 51st and 52d degree of lati∣tude.
They must not be confounded with the
zebra, whose colours are more vivid, and dif∣ferently
disposed. Besides, the zebra constitutes
a particular species, as different from the ass
as from the horse. In the domestic ass, the
skin has become softer, and lost those small tu∣bercles
which are dispersed over that of the o∣nagers,
and of which the inhabitants of the
Levant make the leather called <HI>chagrin.</HI></P>
<P>The nature of the hare is both flexible and
firm; for, though it is diffused over almost every
climate of the Old Continent, yet it continues
nearly the same. In very cold climates, its hair
whitens during the winter, and, in summer, re∣sumes
its natural colour, which varies only from
yellow to red. The quality of the flesh like∣wise
changes. The flesh of the reddish hares is
always the best. But the rabbit, though not of
so flexible a nature as the hare, being less dif∣fused,
and even confined to certain countries, is
subject to more variations; because the hare is
<PB N="412" REF="484"/>
every where wild, while the rabbit is almost
every where half domestic. The colour of the
burrowed rabbits varies from yellow to gray,
white, and black. They likewise vary in size,
and in the quantity and quality of the hair.
This animal, which is originally a native of
Spain, has acquired a long tail in Tartary, and
bushy hair, like felt, in Syria, &amp;c. In cold
countries, black hares are sometimes found. It
is likewise alledged, that, in Norway, and some
other northern regions, there are hares with
horns. M. Klein has given figures of two of
these horned hares<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Klein de quad. p. 52. tab. 3. fig. ad § 21.</NOTE>. From inspection of these
figures, it is easy to perceive, that the horns are
similar to the <HI>wood,</HI> or horns, of the roebuck.
This variety, if it exists, is only individual, and
probably appears in such places alone where the
hare cannot find herbage, and is obliged to feed
upon woody substances, as the bark, buds, and
leaves of trees, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The elk, whose species is confined to the nor∣thern
regions of both Continents, is only smal∣ler
in America than in Europe; and we see,
from the enormous horns found under the
ground in Canada, Russia, Siberia, &amp;c. that
these animals were formerly much larger than
they are at present. This difference of size was
perhaps owing to the perfect tranquillity they
enjoyed in their forests; and, as man had not
yet penetrated into these climates, they had it in
<PB N="413" REF="485"/>
their power to choose their abode in those places
where the air, the soil, and the water, were most
agreeable to them. The rain-deer, which the
Laplanders have rendered domestic, is, for this
reason, more changed than the elk, which has
never been reduced to slavery. The wild rain-deer
are larger and stronger, and have blacker
hair than the domestic kind. The latter have
varied in the colour of the hair, and likewise in
the size of the horns. The rain-deer liverwort,
which constitutes the chief food of these ani∣mals,
seems to contribute greatly, by its nutri∣tive
quality, to the growth of the horns, which
are proportionally larger in the rain-deer than
in any other species. It is, perhaps, the same
aliment which, in this climate, produces horns
in the head of the hare, as well as in that of the
female rain-deer; for, in all other climates, there
are no horned hares, nor any animal of which
the female carries horns as well as the male.</P>
<P>The elephant is the only quadruped upon
whom the domestic state has no influence; be∣cause,
in this state, he refuses to propagate, and,
of course, transmits not to his species the wounds
or defects occasioned by his unnatural condi∣tion.
In the elephant, there are only slight, and
almost individual varieties. His natural colour
is black; some of them, however, are red, and
others white; but their number is exceedingly
small. The elephant likewise varies in size,
according to the longitude, or rather the lati∣tude
<PB N="414" REF="486"/>
of the climate. Under the Torrid Zone,
to which he is entirely confined, he rises to fif∣teen
feet high in the eastern parts of Africa;
while, in the western regions of the same country,
he attains not above ten or eleven feet; which
is a proof that, though great heat be necessary to
the full development of his body, excessive heat
restrains and reduces it to smaller dimensions.
The magnitude of the rhinoceros is more uni∣form;
and he seems to differ from himself on∣ly
by that singular character which distinguishes
him from all other animals, namely, the large
horn on his nose. This horn is single in the
Asiatic rhinoceros, and double in the African.</P>
<P>I decline mentioning the varieties which hap∣pen
in every species of carnivorous animals;
because they are extremely slight; and, of all
quadrupeds, those which feed upon flesh are
most independent of man; and, by means of
this nourishment, already concocted by Nature,
they receive almost none of the qualities of the
soil which they inhabit. Besides, being all en∣dowed
with strength and weapons, they have
the choice of soil and climate in their own op∣tion;
and, consequently, the three causes of
change or degeneration, formerly assigned, must
have very little effect upon them.</P>
<P>After this slight survey of the variations pe∣culiar
to each species, let us next attend to the
more important change of the species themselves.
This is the most antient degeneration; and it
<PB N="415" REF="487"/>
seems to have taken place in each family, or in
each genus, under which the contiguous species
may be comprehended. Of all terrestrial ani∣mals,
there are only some detached species, which,
like that of man, constitute, at the same time,
both genus and species. The elephant, the rhi∣noceros,
the hippopotamus, and the giraffe,
form genera, or simple species, which propagate
in a direct line only, and have no collateral
branches. All the others appear to constitute
families, in which a principal and common
trunk is generally to be recognised, and from
which different branches arise, whose numbers
are proportioned to the barrenness or fertility of
the individuals in each species.</P>
<P>Under this point of view, the horse, the zebra,
and the ass, are all of the same family. If the
horse is the principal trunk, the zebra and the
ass are collateral branches. The number of
their resemblances being infinitely greater than
that of their differences, they may be regarded
as constituting but one genus, of which the chief
characters are apparent, and common to the
whole tree. They alone are whole-hoofed,
without any appearance of toes or claws.
Though they form three distinct species, they
are not absolutely separated, since the jack-ass
produces with the mare, and the horse with the
she-ass; and it is probable, that, if the zebra
were tamed, he would likewise produce with
the mare and ass.</P>
<P><PB N="416" REF="488"/>
The mule, which has always been considered
as a vitiated production, as a monster composed
of two natures, and for that reason has been
thought to be incapable of reproduction, is not,
however, so deeply injured as has been blindly
imagined; for it is not absolutely barren, and its
sterility depends on certain external and pecu∣liar
circumstances. Mules, it is well known,
frequently produce in warm countries; and
there are some examples of their producing
even in our temperate climates. But we know
not whether this generation ever proceeds from
the simple union of a male and female mule, or
of a mule with a mare, or of a jack-ass with a
mule. There are two kinds of mules; the com∣mon
large mule which proceeds from the junc∣tion
of a jack-ass with a mare, and the small
mule, proceeding from the horse and the she-ass,
which we shall distinguish by the name of
<HI>bardeau.</HI> Both kinds were known to the an∣tients:
The first they denominated <HI>mulus,</HI> and
the second <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>hinnus, burdo.</HI> They assure us,
that the <HI>mulus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mulus equa conjunctus mulum procreavit.....

likewise called <HI>ginnus,</HI> or <HI>hinnus</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The word <HI>ginnus</HI> is used by Aristotle in two senses: In the first, it denotes any imperfect animal, an abortion, a dwarf-mule, proceeding sometimes from the horse and she-ass: In the second, it signifies the particular produce of the mule and mare.</NOTE>; that the
<PB N="417" REF="489"/>
she-mule easily conceived, but seldom brought
the foetus to maturity; and that, though exam∣ples
of mules bringing forth were pretty fre∣quent,
yet such productions were always re∣garded
as prodigies. But is not a prodigy in
Nature only an effect more rare than some o∣thers?
Thus we see that, in certain circumstan∣ces,
the mule can generate, and the she-mule
conceive and bring forth. Hence nothing but
experiments are wanting to discover these cir∣cumstances,
and to acquire new facts concerning
generation by the commixture of species, and,
of course, concerning the unity or diversity of
each genus. To succeed in these experiments,
the he-mule must be joined with a she-mule,
with a mare, and with a she-ass: The same pro∣cess
must be observed with regard to the bar∣deau;
and the results of these six copulations
ought to be carefully marked. The female ass,
mule, and bardeau, should likewise be served
with a horse. These experiments, though sim∣ple,
have never been tried with a view to ex∣plain
the nature of generation. I regret that it
has never been in my power to execute them;
but I shall hazard the following conjectures on
what would probably be their results. I ima∣gine,
for example, that, of all these junctions,
that of the he-mule and female bardeau, and
<PB N="418" REF="490"/>
that of the male bardeau and she-mule, would
be absolutely abortive; that the junction of the
he and she mule, and that of the male and fe∣male
bardeau, might perhaps succeed, though
rarely; that the he-mule would produce more
certainly with the mare than with the she-ass,
and the mule bardeau more certainly with the
she-ass than with the mare; and, in fine, that
the horse and jack-ass might perhaps produce
with both the she-mules, but that the ass would
be more successful than the horse. These trials
should be made in a country as warm, at least,
as the south of France; and the mules should be
seven, the horses five, and the asses four years
old; because these different periods are necessary
before the three animals acquire their full vi∣gour.</P>
<P>I now give the analogical reasoning upon
which these conjectures are founded. In the
common order of nature, it is not the males,
but the females, which constitute the unity of
species. We know, from the example of the
sheep, which can admit two different males, and
be equally fertile with the ram or the he-goat,
tha the female has much more influence upon
the specific qualities of the produce than the
male; since, from these two different males,
lambs only, or individuals specifically the same
with the mother, are propagated. Thus the
mule has a greater resemblance to the mare than
to the ass, and the bardeau to the she-ass than
<PB N="419" REF="491"/>
to the horse. Hence <HI>the mule ought to produce
more certainly with the mare than with the she-ass,
and the bardeau more certainly with the she∣ass
than with the mare.</HI> In the same manner,
the horse and jack-ass <HI>would probably produce
with both the she-mules;</HI> because, being females,
though vitiated, each retains more specific quali∣ties
than the male mules: <HI>But the jack-ass should
produce with them more certainly than the horse;</HI>
because the jack-ass has been observed to possess
stronger prolific powers, even when joined with
a mare, than the horse; for the former corrupts
or destroys what had been done by the latter.
Of this fact we may be assured by first serving
mares with a stallion, and next day, or even
some days after, with a jack-ass. Mares ma∣naged
in this manner almost constantly produce
mules, and not horses. This fact, every circum∣stance
of which merits attention, seems to indi∣cate
that the ass, and not the horse, is the prin∣cipal
stock of this family; since the prolific
powers of the ass prevail even with mares, espe∣cially
as the reverse does not take place when
the ass precedes the horse. The latter destroys
not the generation of the ass; for the pro∣duce
is almost always a mule. On the other
hand, the same thing does not take place, when
the jack-ass precedes the horse with a she-ass;
for the latter destroys not the operation of the
former. With regard to the copulation of mules
among themselves, I have presumed it to be ste∣rile;
<PB N="420" REF="492"/>
because, from two temperaments, already
vitiated in the article of generation, and which,
from their union, must be still farther injured, a
produce either totally vitiated, or absolute bar∣renness,
is to be expected.</P>
<P>By the mixture of the mule with the mare,
of the bardeau with the she-ass, and of the horse
and jack-ass with she-mules, individuals might
be obtained which would ascend toward the o∣riginal
species, and would be only half mules.
These, like their parents, would not only possess
the power of engendering with those of their
primitive species, but perhaps of producing a∣mong
themselves; because, being only half vi∣tiated,
their produce would not be more vitiated
than the first mules: And, if these half mules
were still barren, or their offspring rare, it is al∣most
certain, that, by making them approach
another degree toward their original species, the
individuals which, resulting from their union,
being only vitiated one fourth, would produce
among themselves, and form a new stem, which
would neither be precisely that of the horse, nor
that of the ass. Now, as every thing that can
happen has been accomplished in time, and ei∣ther
exists or has existed in Nature, I am in∣clined
to think, that the fertile mule mentioned
by the antients, and which, in the days of A∣ristotle,
existed in the territories of Syria, above
Phoenicia, might be a race of these half or quar∣tern
mules, which had been produced by the
<PB N="421" REF="493"/>
commixtures we have just now described; for
Aristotle says in express terms, that these fertile
mules were perfectly similar to the barren kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In terra Syria super Phoenicem mulae et coeunt et pari∣unt; sed id genus diversum quanquam simile; <HI>Arist. hist. anim. lib. 6. cap.</HI> 24.—Sunt in Syria quos mulos appellant genus diversum ab eo quod coitu equae et asini procreatur: Sed simile facie, quomodo asini sylvestres similitudine quadam nomen urbanorum accepere; et quidem ut asini illi feri sic muli praestant celeritate.

Tres tamen ex novem quos numero olim fuisse aiunt, servantur hoc tempore; <HI>Idem, cap.</HI> 36.</NOTE>.
He clearly distinguishes them from the <HI>onagri,</HI>
or wild asses, which he mentions in the same
chapter; and, consequently, those animals can
only be referred to the mules which have suf∣fered
little vitiation, and preserved their gene∣rative
powers. The <HI>czigithai,</HI> or fertile mule of
Tartary, it is probable, was not the onager or
wild ass, but this same Phoenician mule, whose
race, perhaps, still remains. The first traveller
who compares them, will confirm or destroy
this conjecture. Even the zebra, which has a
greater resemblance to the horse than to the ass,
might have a similar origin. The constrained
regularity of his colours, which are disposed in
alternate bands of black and white, seems to in∣dicate
that they proceed from two different spe∣cies,
which, in their mixture, have separated as
much as possible; for none of the operations of
Nature is so abrupt, and so little shaded, as the
<PB N="422" REF="494"/>
coat of the zebra, where she passes quickly and
alternately from white to black, and from black
to white, without any intermediate step, through
the whole extent of the animal's body.</P>
<P>However this matter stands, it is certain, from
what is above remarked, that mules, in general,
which have uniformly been accused of sterility,
are neither really nor universally barren; and
that this sterility is particularly apparent only in
the mule which proceeds from the ass and horse;
for the mule produced by the he-goat and the
ewe is equally fertile as its parents; and most of
the mules produced by different species of birds
are not barren. It is, therefore, in the particu∣lar
nature of the horse and ass that we must
search for the causes of the sterility of the mules
which proceed from their union; and, instead of
supposing barrenness to be a general and neces∣sary
defect common to all mules, it should be
limited to the mule produced by the ass and
horse; and even this limitation ought to be re∣stricted,
as these same mules, in certain circum∣stances,
become fertile, particularly when brought
a degree nearer to their original species.</P>
<P>The mules produced by the horse and ass
have their organs of generation as complete as
other animals. Nothing seems to be defective
either in the male or female. The seminal
fluid of the male is copious; and, as he is not
permitted to copulate, he is often so pressed for
a discharge, that he lies down on his belly, in
<PB N="423" REF="495"/>
order to produce a collision on his fore legs,
which are folded under his breast. These ani∣mals,
therefore, are furnished with every thing
necessary to the act of generation. They are
even extremely ardent, and, consequently, very
indifferent in their choice. The males have
nearly the same vehemence of desire for the fe∣male
mule, the she-ass, and the mare. Hence
there is no difficulty of procuring copulations;
but, to render these prolific, particular attentions
are necessary. Too much ardour, especially in
the females, is generally followed with sterility;
and the female mule is at least as ardent as the
she-ass. Now, we know that the latter rejects
the seminal fluid of the male, and that, to make
her retain it and conceive, she must have blows,
or water thrown on her crupper, in order to
calm the convulsive emotions of desire which
subsist after copulation, and are the cause of this
rejection. The she-ass and female mule, there∣fore,
by their too great ardour, have both a
tendency to barrenness. This tendency is in∣creased
by another cause: As these animals are
originally natives of warm climates, cold is an
obstacle to their propagation; and, for this rea∣son,
they are only allowed to copulate in sum∣mer.
When their union is permitted at any
other time, and particularly in winter, it seldom
produces impregnation. The season necessary
to the success of their generation is equally so to
the preservation of their young. The colt must
<PB N="424" REF="496"/>
be brought forth when the season is warm,
otherwise it either languishes or dies: And, as
the she-ass goes one year with young, she brings
forth in the same season that she conceives. This
is a sufficient proof that heat is necessary not
only to the fecundity of these animals, but to
the vigour of their bodies. On account of the
great ardour of the female, she is served with a
male almost immediately after she brings forth.
She is not allowed above seven or eight days of
repose between delivery and copulation. Weaken∣ed
by the birth, she is then less ardent, the parts
have not had time sufficient to resume their for∣mer
tension; and, of course, conception is more
certain than when she is in full vigour and ar∣dour.
In this species, as in that of the cat, the
temperament of the female is said to be much
more ardent than that of the male. The jack∣ass,
however, is remarkable for vigour. He
can cover females several times a day succes∣sively.
He has been known to go to such
excess, without any other incitement than na∣tural
appetite, as to die on the spot, after eleven
or twelve efforts, repeated almost without inter∣val;
and, to support this great waste, he took
nothing but a few draughts of water. This
flame which consumes him is too vivid to be
durable: An ass stallion is soon unfit either for
propagation or service; and this, perhaps, is the
reason why the female has been said to have
more strength, and to live longer than the male.
<PB N="425" REF="497"/>
It is certain, that, with the management former∣ly
recommended, she can live thirty years, and
bring forth annually during her whole life.
But the male, when not restrained from females,
abuses his strength to such a degree, that, in a
few years, he loses the power of engendering.</P>
<P>Hence both the male and female asses have a
tendency to sterility by common, and likewise
by different qualities. The horse and mare have
the same tendency. The stallion may be given
to the mare nine or ten days after she has
brought forth, and she can produce five or six
years in succession; but, after the period, she
becomes barren. To support her fecundity, she
should be allowed an interval of a year between
each birth, and treated differently from the she∣ass.
Instead of giving her the stallion soon af∣ter
delivery, she should be restrained from him
till the following year, and till her ardour is
manifested by the fluids she ejects. Even with
these precautions, she seldom retains her fertili∣ty
beyond the age of twenty-five years. On
the other hand, the horse, though less ardent and
more delicate than the jack-ass, preserves the
faculty of propagating much longer. I have
known old horses, who were unable to mount
the mare without the aid of the groom, resume
their vigour when properly placed, and engender
at the age of thirty years. In the horse, the semi∣nal
fluid is not only less abundant, but less stimu∣lant
than in the jack-ass; for the horse often co∣pulates
<PB N="426" REF="498"/>
without ejection, especially when the mare
is presented to him before he discovers any in∣clination.
After enjoyment, he appears to be
melancholy; and a considerable interval is ne∣cessary
for resuming his ardour. Besides, his most
vigorous efforts are not always successful. Some
mares are naturally barren, and a greater num∣ber
of them possess very little fertility. There
are likewise stallions, which, though apparently
vigorous, have very little power. To these par∣ticular
reasons, we can add a more evident and
a more general proof of the small degree of fer∣tility
in the horse and ass: Of all domestic ani∣mals,
though most attention is bestowed on them,
they are the least numerous. In the ox, the
sheep, the goat, and particularly the hog, the
dog, and the cat, the individuals are ten, and
perhaps a hundred times more numerous than
those of the horse and ass. Thus their defec∣tiveness
in fecundity is proved by the facts; and
to all these causes, the sterlity of mules, which
are produced by the union of those naturally
unprolific species, ought to be ascribed. In those
species, on the contrary, which, like the sheep
and goat, are numerous, and consequently pro∣lific,
the mules proceeding from their intermix∣ture
are not barren, but ascend to the orignal
species in the first generation. But it would re∣quire
two, three, and perhaps four generations,
to enable the mule produced by the union of
<PB N="427" REF="499"/>
the horse and ass to arrive at the same degree of
re-establishment of its nature.</P>
<P>Another kind of mule has been said to have
resulted from the copulation of the bull and
mare. Columella, I believe, is the first who
mentions it. Gesner quotes him, and adds, that
these mules are found near Grenoble, and are
called, in French, <HI>jumars.</HI> I had one of these
jumars brought to me from Dauphiny, and ano∣ther
from the Pyrenees; and I discovered, both
from inspecting their external figure, and dis∣secting
their internal parts, that these jumars
were nothing but bardeaus, or mules produced
between the horse and she-ass. Hence I am led
to conclude, both from this experiment, and
from analogy, that this kind of mule has no
existence, and that the word <HI>jumar</HI> is a chime∣rical
name, without any real object. The na∣ture
of the bull is too remote from that of the
mare to permit their producing together; the
one having four stomachs, horns, cloven feet,
&amp;c. and the other being whole hoofed, hornless,
and having but one stomach. The organs of ge∣neration
are likewise so very different, both in
size and proportions, that there is no reason for
supposing that they could unite either with plea∣sure
or success. If the bull were to produce
with any other species than his own, it would
be with the buffalo, which resembles him in
structure as well as in natural habits; yet we
have never heard of mules produced by these
<PB N="428" REF="500"/>
two animals, though they are often found in
the same places, either in a domestic or a free
state. What is related concerning the fertile in∣tercourse
of the stag and cow, appears to be e∣qually
suspicious as the history of the jumars,
though the stag, by his conformation, is not so
far removed from the nature of the cow as the
bull is from that of the mare.</P>
<P>The deer-kind, who have <HI>wood</HI> instead of
horns, and though they chew the cud, and have
the same internal structure with those animals
who have horns, seem to constitute a separate
family, of which the elk is the largest stem, and
the rain-deer, the stag, the axis, the fallow-deer,
and the roebuck, are smaller and collateral bran∣ches;
for there are only six species of quadru∣peds,
whose head is armed with branched horns,
which fall off and are renewed every year: In∣dependent
of this generic character, which is
common to the whole, they resemble each other
still more in structure and natural habits. We
should, therefore, rather expect mules from a
commixture of the stag or fallow-deer with the
axis or rain-deer, than from that of the stag
with the cow.</P>
<P>We have still greater reason to regard all the
sheep and all the goats as constituting the same
family; because they produce together mules,
which ascend directly, and in the first genera∣tion,
to the species of the sheep. To this nu∣merous
family of sheep and goats, we might add
<PB N="429" REF="501"/>
those of the gazelles and bubalus, which are not
less numerous. In this genus, which compre∣hends
more than thirty species, it appears that
the mouflon, the wild goat, the chamois goat,
the antilope, the bubalus, the condoma, &amp;c.
are principal stems, and that the others are on∣ly
accessory branches, who have all retained the
chief characters of the stems from which they
issued; but, at the same time, they have been
prodigiously varied by the influences of climate,
food, and a state of servitude, to which man has
reduced most of these animals.</P>
<P>The dog, the wolf, the fox, the jackal, and
the isatis, form another genus, the different spe∣cies
of which are so similar, particularly in
their internal structure and the organs of gene∣ration,
that it is difficult to conceive why they
do not intermix. From the experiments I made,
with regard to the union of the dog with the
wolf and fox, the repugnance to copulation
seemed to proceed rather from the wolf than the
dog, that is, from the wild, and not from the
domestic animal; for the bitches which I put
to the trial would have willingly permitted the
fox and wolf; but the she-wolf and female fox
would never suffer the approaches of the dog.
The domestic state seems to render animals less
faithful to their species. It likewise makes them
more ardent and more fertile: The bitch gene∣rally
produces twice in a year: But the she-wolf
and the female fox produce only once in
<PB N="430" REF="502"/>
the same period: And, it is probable, that the
dogs who have become wild and have multi∣plied
in the island of Juan Fernandez, and in
the mountains of St Domingo, produce but once
a year, like the fox and wolf. Were this fact
ascertained, it would fully establish the unity of
genus in these three animals, who resemble each
other so much in structure, that their repugnance
to intermixing must be solely ascribed to some
external circumstances.</P>
<P>The dog seems to be an intermediate species
between the fox and wolf. The antients affirm,
that, in certain circumstances, and in particu∣lar
countries, the dog produces with the wolf
and fox<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In Cyrenensi agro lupi cum canibus coeunt, et <HI>Laconici</HI> canes ex vulpe et cane generantur; <HI>Arist. bist. anim. lib. 8. cap.</HI> 28.... Coeunt animalia generis ejusdem secundum na∣turam, sed ea etiam quorum genus diversum quidem, sed na∣tura non multum distat; si modo par magnitudo sit et tem∣pora aequent graviditatis, raro id fit, sed tamen id fieri et in canibus et in vulpibus, et in lupis, certum est; <HI>Idem, de generat. anim. lib. 2. cap.</HI> 5.</NOTE>. I endeavoured to ascertain this fact;
and, though I did not succeed, we must not
conclude it to be impossible; for my experi∣ments
were confined to captive animals; and it
is well known, that, in some species, captivity
alone is sufficient to extinguish the desire, and
to create a repugnance to copulation, even with
their equals. This state of restraint, therefore,
ought to have a still greater effect in preventing
their union with individuals of a different spe∣cies.
<PB N="431" REF="503"/>
But I am persuaded, that the dog, when
at liberty and deprived of his own female, might
intermix with the wolf and fox, especially af∣ter
he had become wild, lost the odour of a do∣mestic
state, and approached these animals in
their natural manner and habits. I believe not,
however, that the fox and wolf ever unite;
since they both live in the same climates, with∣out
attempting to intermix. If ever, therefore,
they belonged to the same species, their dege∣neration
must be referred to a period beyond the
records of history. This is the reason why I
asserted, that the dog was an intermediate spe∣cies
between the fox and wolf: His species is
also common, since he is capable of uniting with
both. And, if any circumstance could show
that these three animals proceeded originally
from the same stock, it is the common relation
between the dog and the fox and wolf, which
brings the species nearer each other than all the
similarities in their figure and organization. To
reduce the fox and wolf, therefore, to one spe∣cies,
we must ascend to a state of nature in a
very remote period of antiquity. But, in their
actual condition, the wolf and fox must be re∣garded
as the chief stems in the genus of the
five animals under consideration. The dog, the
jackal, and the isatis, are only lateral branches
situated between the two first. The jackal par∣ticipates
of the dog and wolf, and the isatis of
the jackal and fox. It likewise appears, from
<PB N="432" REF="504"/>
a great number of authorities, that the jackal
and dog easily produce together; and we per∣ceive,
from the description and history of the i∣satis,
that he resembles the fox almost entirely
in figure and temperament; that they equally
frequent cold countries; but that he, at the same
time, has the natural, dispositions of the jackal,
the continual barking, the clamorous voice,
and the habit of going always in packs.</P>
<P>The shepherd's dog, which I consider as the
original stem of all dogs, makes, at the same time,
the nearest approach to the fox in figure. His
size is the same, and, like the fox, he has erect
ears, a pointed muzzle, and a straight, trailing
tail. He likewise resembles the fox in voice,
sagacity, and subtlety of instinct. Hence this dog
may have originally proceeded from the fox,
if not in a direct, at least in a collateral line.
The dog that Aristotle calls <HI>canis laconicus,</HI>
and which he assures us is produced from a
mixture of the fox and dog, may be the same
with the shepherd's dog; or, at least, it has
a greater affinity to him than to any other
dog. It is natural to imagine, that the epithet
<HI>laconicus,</HI> which Aristotle does not explain, was
given to this dog, because he was found in Laconia,
a province of Greece. But, if we attend to the o∣rigin
of this <HI>laconic</HI> dog, we will perceive, that
the race was not limited to the country of Laco∣nia
alone, but must have been equally common
<PB N="433" REF="505"/>
in all countries inhabited by foxes. This cir∣cumstance
induces me to think, that Aristotle
employed the epithet <HI>laconicus</HI> to express the
brevity and acuteness of the animal's voice; be∣cause
he did not bark like other dogs, but yelp∣ed
like a fox. Now, our shepherd's dog is best
entitled to the denomination of <HI>laconic;</HI> for, of
all dogs, his voice is sharpest and most seldom
employed. Besides, the characters ascribed by A∣ristotle
to this <HI>laconic</HI> dog correspond very well
with those of the shepherd's dog; and this cir∣cumstance
contributes still farther to convince
me that they were the same. That the reader
may judge whether my conjecture is properly
founded, I have inserted the entire passage of
Aristotle in the margin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Laconici canes ex Vulpe et Cane generantur; <HI>Hist. anim. lib. 8. cap.</HI> 28.—Canum genera plura sunt.

<P>By the word <HI>genus</HI> Aristotle means <HI>race.</HI> He distinguishes three races of dogs, the <HI>Laconious,</HI> the <HI>Moloticus,</HI> and the <HI>Pe∣cuarius.</HI> The <HI>Moloticus,</HI> which he likewise calls <HI>Venaticus,</HI> is probably our grey-hound, which in Greece and Asia-Minor is the common hunting dog. The <HI>Pecuarius,</HI> which he says greatly exceeds all other dogs in magnitude, is unquestion∣ably the mastiff, and is used for defending the cattle from ferocious animals. The <HI>Laconious,</HI> to which he assigns no employment, and only remarks, that it is a dog of great in∣dustry and labour, and that it is smaller than the <HI>Pecuarius,</HI> can be nothing else than the shepherd's dog, which is very laborious in arranging, restraining, and conducting the sheep, and is more industrious and attentive than any other dog. But the greatest difficulty in these passages quoted from Ari∣stotle consists in the different periods of gestation which he ascribes to the different races of dogs. Some of them, he says, go with young two months, others two months and a half, and others three months; for all our dogs, of whatever race, go with young about nine weeks, or from sixty-one to sixty-three days; and I know not if ever a greater difference in the time of gestation has been observed than three or four days. But Aristotle might be more skilled in this subject than we are. And, if the facts he advances be true, certain dogs must have a greater affinity with the wolf than others; for we are assured by the hunters, that the wolf goes with young three months, or three months and a half.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="434" REF="506"/>
The genus of cruel and rapacious animals is
one of the most numerous and most diversified.
<PB N="435" REF="507"/>
Evil here, as well as elsewhere, assumes every
kind of form. The lion and the tiger, being
detached species, hold the first rank. All the
others, as the panther, the ounce, the leopard,
the lynx, the caracal, the jaguar, the couguar,
the ocelot, the serval, the margai, and the cat,
constitute but one sanguinary family, the dif∣ferent
branches of which are more or less ex∣tended
and diversisied, according to the difference
of climates. All these animals, though very
different in magnitude and figure, resemble each
other in their natural dispositions. They all
have fiery eyes, short muzzles, and sharp, crook∣ed,
and retractile claws. They are all destruc∣tive,
ferocious, and untameable. The cat,
which is the least and smallest species, though
reduced to slavery, is neither less perfidious, nor
more obedient. The wild cat has preserved
the character of the family. He is equally
cruel, mischievous, and depredatory, as his lar∣ger
kindred. They are all equally carnivorous,
and enemies to the other animals. Man, with
all his powers, has never been able to destroy
them. He has at all times employed against
<PB N="436" REF="508"/>
them fire, steel, poison, and snares. But, as
all the individuals are very prolific, and the
species numerous, the efforts of man have been
limited to banishing and confining them in the
deserts, from which they never issue without
marking their paths with terror and with blood.
A single tiger escaping from the forest, alarms a
whole people, and obliges them to take up arms:
How dreadful would be the consequences, if
these sanguinary animals went in troops, and, like
the wild dogs and jackals, extended their projects
of depredation? Nature has bestowed this in∣telligence
upon timid animals; but has happily
denied it to the bold and solitary tribes. They
always travel alone, and confide solely in their
courage and strength. It had not escaped the
observation of Aristotle, that no animal possessed
of crooked and retractile claws was social, or went
in troops<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nullum animal, cui ungues adunci, gregatile esse perpen∣dimus; <HI>Arist. hist. anim. lib. 1. cap.</HI> 1.</NOTE>. This remark, which then applied
to four or five species only, the only ones of this
genus which were known in his time, is now
found to be true, and to extend to ten or twelve
species that have since been discovered. The
other carnivorous animals, as the wolf, the fox,
the dog, the jackal, and the isatis, whose claws
are straight, go always in troops, and are all
timid, and even dastardly.</P>
<P>By comparing, in this manner, all the qua∣drupeds,
and ranking each under its own ge∣nus,
<PB N="437" REF="509"/>
we shall find, that the two hundred spe∣cies,
whose history we have given, may be re∣duced
to a small number of families or principal
stems, from which all the others have probably
derived their origin.</P>
<P>All the animals common to both Continents,
and all those which are peculiar to the Old World,
may be reduced to fifteen genera, and nine so∣litary
or detached species. These genera are,
1. The whole-hoofed genus properly so called,
which comprehends the horse, the zebra, and
the ass, together with the fertile and unfertile
mules. 2. The large cloven-hoofed, with hol∣low
horns, as the ox, and the buffalo, with all
their varieties. 3. The small cloven-hoofed,
with hollow horns, as the sheep, the goat, the
gazelle, the antilope, and all the other species
which participate of their nature. 4. The cloven
hoofed, with solid horns, which fall off and are
renewed every year. This family comprehends
the elk, the rain-deer, the stag, the fallow-deer,
the axis, and the roebuck. 5. The ambiguous
cloven-hoofed, which is composed of the wild
boar, and all the other varieties of the hog, as
the hog of Siam with a pendulous belly;
that of Guiney, with long pointed ears lying
on the back; that of the Canaries, with long,
thick tusks, &amp;c. 6. The extensive genus of
digitated carnivorous animals, with crooked
and retractile claws, in which are comprehend∣ed
the panther, leopard, ounce, serval, and cat,
<PB N="438" REF="510"/>
with all their varieties. 7. Digitated, carnivo∣rous
animals with straight and fixed claws, under
which are comprehended the wolf, fox, jackal,
isatis, and dog, with all their varieties. 8. Digitated
carnivorous animals with fixed claws, and a pouch
under the tail. This genus is composed of the
hyaena, civet, zibet, genet, badger, &amp;c. 9. Di∣gitated
carnivorous animals, with a very long
body, five toes on each foot, and the thumb
separated from the other toes. This genus
comprehends the martin, polecat, sable, ferret,
ichneumon, weasel, vansire, &amp;c. 10. The nu∣merous
family of digitated quadrupeds, which
have two large cutting teeth in each jaw, and
no prickles on the body. This genus contains
the hare, the rabbit, and all the species of squir∣rels,
dormice, marmots, and rats. 11. Digitated
quadrupeds with prickles on their body, as the
porcupines and hedge-hog. 12. Digitated ani∣mals
covered with scales, as the long-tailed and
short-tailed manis, or scaly lizards. 13. The
amphibious digitated genus, comprehending
the otter, beaver, musk-rats, walrus, and seals.
14. The four-handed genus, which includes
the apes, baboons, monkeys, makis, loris, &amp;c.
15. Lastly, the winged quadrupeds, comprehend∣ing
bats of all kinds.—The nine detached species
are, the elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus,
giraffe, camel, lion, tiger, bear, and mole, which
are all subject to a greater or smaller number of
varieties.</P>
<P><PB N="439" REF="511"/>
Of these fifteen genera and nine detached
species, seven genera and two species are com∣mon
to both Continents. The two species are
the bear and mole. The seven genera are, 1.
The large cloven-hoofed, with hollow horns;
for the ox is found in America under the form
of the bison. 2. The cloven-hoofed, with so∣lid
horns; for the elk exists in Canada under
the name of <HI>original,</HI> the rain-deer under that of
<HI>caribou,</HI> and stags, fallow-deer, and roebucks,
are found in almost every province of North
America. 3. The digitated carnivorous qua∣drupeds
with fixed claws; for the wolf and fox
are found in the New as well as in the Old
World. 4, The digitated long-bodied genus;
for the pine weasel, martin, and polecat, are
found in America. 5. A part of the digitated
genus with two large cutting teeth in each jaw,
as the squirrels, marmots, rats, &amp;c. are like∣wise
found in America. 6. The digitated am∣phibious
genus, as the walrus, seal, beaver, and
otter, exists in the northern regions of the New
Continent. 7. The digitated winged genus
likewise exists in America; as the bat and vam∣pire.</P>
<P>There remains, therefore, only eight genera
and five detached species, which are peculiar to
the Old World: 1. The whole-hoofed genus
properly so called; for neither horses, nor asses,
nor zebras, nor mules, were found in America.
2. The small cloven-hoofed genus with hollow
<PB N="440" REF="512"/>
horns; for sheep, goats, gazelles, and antilopes,
had no existence in the New World. 3. The
hog-genus; for the species of the wild boar ex∣ists
not in America; and, though the pecari and
its varieties are related to this family, they dif∣fer
in characters so remarkable as to justify their
separation. 4. The same remark is applicable
to the carnivorous animals with retractile claws;
and, though the jaguar, couguar, ocelot, and
margai appear to belong to this family, none of
these species of the New World are found in the
Old, and none of those of the Antient Continent
are found in the New. 5. The same remark is
applicable to the digitated quadrupeds, whose
bodies are covered with prickles; for, though
the coendou and Canada porcupine make a near
approach to this genus, they differ widely from
the hedge-hogs and porcupines. 6. The digita∣ted
carnivorous genus, with fixed claws; for the
hyaena, the civets, and the badgers, have no ex∣istence
in America. 7. The four-handed genus;
for, in America, there are no apes, baboons,
monkeys, nor makis. The sapajous, the sagoins,
the opossums, &amp;c. though likewise four-hand∣ed,
differ essentially from those of the Old Con∣tinent.
8. The digitated genus whose bodies
are covered with scales; for none of the scaly
lizards are found in America; and the ant-eaters,
to which the former may be compared, are
covered with hair, and differ too much from
<PB N="441" REF="513"/>
the scaly lizards to be admitted into the same
family.</P>
<P>Of the nine detached species, seven, namely,
the elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, giraffe,
camel, lion, and tiger, are found only in the Old
World; and two, to wit, the bear and mole, are
common to both Continents.</P>
<P>If we make a similar enumeration of the ani∣mals
peculiar to the New World, we shall find,
that there are about fifteen different species, which
may be reduced to ten genera, and four detach∣ed
species. These four species are the tapir, the
cabiai, the lama, and the pecari: But the tapir
is properly the only species which is absolutely
detached; for that of the pecari has varieties;
and the pacos may be united with the lama, and
the Guinea-pig with the cabiai. The ten genera
are, 1. Eight species of sapajous. 2. Six species
of sagoins. 3. The opossums, phalangers, the
tarsiers, &amp;c. 4. The jaguars, couguars, ocelots,
margais, &amp;c. 5. Three or four species of co∣atis.
6. Four or five species of mouffettes, or
stinking weasels. 7. The genus of agouti, com∣prehending
the acouchi, the paca, the aperea, and
the tapeti, or Brasilian hare. 8. That of the
armadillos, which consists of seven or eight spe∣cies.
9. Two or three species of ant-eaters.
10. Two species of sloths.</P>
<P>These ten genera and four detached species,
to which the animals peculiar to the New World
may be reduced, though they differ from those
<PB N="442" REF="514"/>
of the Old Continent, have remote relations
which seem to indicate something common in
their formation, and lead us to causes of dege∣neration
more antient, perhaps, than all the o∣thers.
We formerly made the general remark,
that all the animals of the New World were
much smaller than those of the Old. This great
diminution in magnitude, whatever be the cause
of it, is a primary kind of degeneration, which
could not happen without having a considerable
influence on the figure of all these animals; and,
in comparing them, we must not lose sight of
this first effect.</P>
<P>The largest is the tapir, which, as he exceeds
not the size of an ass, cannot be compared to the
elephant, rhinoceros, or hippopotamus. In the
New Continent, he is the largest animal, as the
elephant is in the Old. Like the rhinoceros,
his upper lip is muscular and prominent; and,
like the hippopotamus, he frequents the water.
He alone represents, in some degree, these three
animals; and his figure, which resembles the
ass more than that of any other quadruped, seems
to be as much degraded as his statute is dimi∣nished.
The horse, the ass, the zebra, the ele∣phant,
the rhinoceros, and the hippopotamus, had
no existence in America: Neither was there, in
this New World, any animal which could be com∣pared
with them either for magnitude or figure.
The tapir seems to be the least remote from the
whole of these animals: But, at the same time,
<PB N="443" REF="515"/>
he is so mixed, and approaches so little to any
one of them, that it is impossible to attribute his
origin to any particular species: And, notwith∣standing
the slight relations he has to the rhino∣ceros,
the hippopotamus, and the ass, he ought
to be regarded not only as a peculiar species, but
even as a singular genus.</P>
<P>Hence the tapir is not even remotely allied to
any species of the Old Continent, and has hard∣ly
any characters which make him approach
those animals to which we have been comparing
him. In the same manner, the cabiai has no ex∣ternal
relation to any other animal, and he ap∣proaches
the Guinea-pig, in his external parts
only, which belongs to the same Continent, and
both species are absolutely different from all those
of the Old World.</P>
<P>The lama and pacos seem to possess more per∣ceptible
marks of their antient lineage, the first
with the camel, and the second with the sheep.
The lama, like the camel, has long legs, a very
long neck, a light head, and the upper lip divi∣ded.
He likewise resembles the camel in mild∣ness
of disposition, servility of spirit, sobriety, and
aptness for labour. Among the Americans, he
was the first and the most useful of their dome∣stic
animals. He was employed, as the Arabs
use the camel, for carrying burdens. To
these conformities in the nature of the two ani∣mals,
we may add the permanent marks of la∣bour;
for, though the back of the lama be not
<PB N="444" REF="516"/>
deformed with bunches, like that of the camel,
he has natural callosities on his breast, because
he has the same habit of reposing on that part of
the body. Notwithstanding all these relations,
the species of the lama is very different from that
of the camel. The lama exceeds not in magni∣tude
one-fourth or one-third of that of the ca∣mel.
The figure of his body, the quality and
colour of his hair, are also very different: His
temperament is phlegmatic, and he delights in
the mountains only. But the temperament of
the camel is adust, and lives spontaneously among
burning sands. In fine, there are more specific
differences, perhaps, between the camel and la∣ma,
than between the camel and giraffe. These
three animals possess several common characters,
by which they might be united into one genus.
But, at the same time, they differ so much in o∣ther
characters that they cannot be supposed to
have sprung from one another: They are neigh∣bours,
but not relations. The giraffe is almost
double the height of the camel, and the camel
is double that of the lama. The two first belong
to the Old Continent, and form distinct species:
Of course, the species of the lama, which is pe∣culiar
to the New World, is remote from both.</P>
<P>The same remark applies not to the pecari:
Though of a different species from the hog, he
belongs to the same genus. In figure, and al∣most
every external relation, he resembles the
hog; and only differs from that animal in some
<PB N="445" REF="517"/>
minute characters, such as the aperture on his
back, the figure of the stomach and intestines,
&amp;c. We might therefore be led to think, that
the pecari had sprung from the same stem with
the hog, and that he had formerly passed from
the Old to the New World, where, by the in∣fluence
of the soil, he had degenerated so greatly
as now to form a distinct species.</P>
<P>With regard to the pacos, though it seems to
have some relations to the sheep by its wool and
habit of body, it differs so much in every other
article, that they cannot be considered as allied
species. The pacos is rather a small kind of la∣ma,
and appears not, from any character, to have
ever passed from the one Continent to the other.
Hence, of the four detached species peculiar to
the New World, three, namely, the tapir, the
cabiai, and the lama and pacos, appear to have
been at all times proper to this Continent. But
the pecari, which is the fourth, seems to be only
a degenerated species of hog, and to have for∣merly
derived its origin from the Old Conti∣nent.</P>
<P>From a similar examination and comparison
of the ten genera, to which we have reduced
the other animals peculiar to South America, we
shall find not only singular relations in their na∣ture,
but marks of their antient origin and de∣generation.
The sapajous and sagoins have so
great a resemblance to the monkeys, that they
have obtained the common name of ape. We
<PB N="446" REF="518"/>
have proved, however, that their species, and
even their genera, are different. Besides, it
would be difficult to conceive how the monkeys
of the Old World could assume, in America, a
different figure of face, a long, muscular, and
prehensile tail, a large partition between the no∣strils,
and other characters both specific and ge∣neric,
by which we have distinguished and sepa∣rated
them from the sapajous. But, as the apes,
the baboons, and the monkeys, are peculiar to
the Old World, the sapajous and sagoins should
be regarded as their representatives in the New;
for these animals have nearly the same form,
both external and internal, and, in their man∣ners
and dispositions, they possess many things
in common. In the same manner, there are no
makis in America, and yet they are represented
by the opossums, or four-handed animals with
sharp muzzles, which are very numerous in the
New Continent, but exist not in the Old. It must
be remarked, however, that there is a much great∣er
difference between the nature and form of the
makis and these four-handed American animals,
than between the monkeys and sapajous; and that
the interval between an opossum and a maki is
so great, that we cannot think they ever pro∣ceeded
from each other, without supposing that
degeneration is capable of producing effects e∣qual
to those of a new nature; for most of these
American four-handed species have a pouch un∣der
the belly, ten cutting teeth in each jaw, and
<PB N="447" REF="519"/>
a prehensile tail; while the makis have no pouch
under their belly, a flaccid tail, and only four
cutting teeth in the upper, and six in the under
jaw. Hence, though these animals have their
hands and fingers constructed in the same man∣ner,
and likewise resemble each other in the
length of the muzzle, their species, and even their
genera, are so different, that it is impossible to
imagine they ever proceeded from one another,
or that such great and general disparities could
be produced by degeneration.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the American tigers, which
we have treated of under the appellation of ja∣guars,
couguars, ocelots, and margais, though
different in species from the panther, leopard,
ounce, and serval of the Old Continent, unque∣stionably
belong to the same genus. All these
animals resemble each other greatly, both exter∣nally
and internally. They have also the same
natural dispositions, the same ferocity, the same
vehement thirst for blood; and, what makes
them approach still nearer in genus, those of the
same Continent differ more from each other, than
from those of the other Continent. For ex∣ample,
the African panther differs less from the
Brasilian jaguar, than the latter differs from the
couguar, though they belong to the same coun∣try.
In the same manner, the Asiatic serval and
the margai of Guiana differ less from one ano∣ther
than from the species peculiar to their own
Continents. We may, therefore, conclude that
<PB N="448" REF="520"/>
these animals have had a common origin, and
that they have formerly passed from the one
Continent to the other. Their actual differen∣ces
have proceeded solely from the long conti∣nued
influence of their new situation.</P>
<P>The mouffettes, or stinking weasels of Ameri∣ca,
and the European polecat, seem to belong
to the same genus. In general, when a genus is
common to both Continents, the species of which
it is composed are more numerous in the Old
than in the New. In this instance, however,
the contrary takes place: In America, there are
four or five species of polecats, while we have
but one, whose nature seems to be inferior to
that of all the others; so that the New World,
in its turn, appears to have representatives in the
Old; and, if we judged only from the fact, we would
be led to think, that these animals had taken a
contrary route, and passed from America into
Europe. The same remark is applicable to some
other species. The roebucks and the fallow-deer,
as well as the mouffettes, are more nume∣rous
and likewise stronger in the New than in
the Old Continent. We might, therefore, ima∣gine
that they are original natives of America.
But, as we know that all animals were created
in the Old Continent, we must necessarily ad∣mit
their migration from the Old to the New
World, and at the same time suppose, that, in∣stead
of degenerating, like all the other Ameri∣can
<PB N="449" REF="521"/>
species, they have improved by the influen∣ces
of the soil and climate.</P>
<P>The ant-eaters, which are singular creatures,
and of which there are three or four species in
the New World, appear also to have their repre∣sentatives
in the Old. The scaly lizards resemble
the ant-eaters in the peculiar character of having
no teeth, and of being obliged to stretch out their
tongue and feed upon ants. But, if we assign
them a common origin, it is strange that, instead
of scales, which they have in Asia, they are co∣vered
with hair in America.</P>
<P>With regard to the agoutis, pacos, and other
animals which constitute the seventh genus pe∣culiar
to the New Continent, they can only be
compared with the hare and rabbit, from which,
however, they all differ in species. It is diffi∣cult
to assign them a common origin; because
the hare is diffused over almost every climate of
the Old Continent, without undergoing any o∣ther
change than in the colour of his hair. It is
by no means probable, therefore, that the cli∣mate
of America should have so far changed the
nature of our hares, as to make them tapetis and
apereas, which have no tail; or agoutis with a
sharp muzzle, and short round ears; or pacos
with a large head, short ears, and coarse hair
with white bands.</P>
<P>In fine, the coatis, the armadillos, and the
sloths, differ so much not only in species, but in
genus, from all the animals in the Old World,
<PB N="450" REF="522"/>
that they can be compared to none of them, and
that it is impossible to refer them to any com∣mon
origin, or to ascribe to the effects of dege∣neration
the prodigious differences in their na∣ture
from that of any other animal.</P>
<P>Thus, of ten genera and four detached species,
to which we have endeavoured to reduce all the
animals peculiar to the New World, there are
only two, namely, the genus of jaguars, ocelots,
&amp;c. and the species of the pecari, with their va∣rieties,
which can, with any degree of probabili∣ty,
be referred to the animals of the Old World.
The jaguars and ocelots may be regarded as spe∣cies
of the leopard or panther, and the pecari as
a species of hog. There are also five genera and
one detached species, namely, the species of the
lama, the genera of sapajous, sagoins, mouffettes,
agoutis, and ant-eaters, which may be compa∣red,
though in an equivocal and very distant
manner, with the camel, the monkeys, the pole∣cat,
the hare, and the scaly lizards: And, in fine,
there remain four genera and two detached spe∣cies,
namely, the opossums, the coatis, the arma∣dillos,
the sloths, the tapir, and cabiai, which can
neither be referred nor compared to any genera
or species in the Old Continent. This seems to
be a sufficient proof, that the origin of these ani∣mals
peculiar to the New World cannot be at∣tributed
to degeneration alone: However power∣ful
we may suppose the effects of degeneration,
we can never suppose, with any appearance of
<PB N="451" REF="523"/>
reason, that these animals were originally the
same with those of the Old Continent. It is
more probable, that the two Continents were for∣merly
united, and that the species which inha∣bited
the New World, because the soil and cli∣mate
were most agreeable to their nature, were
separated from the others by the irruption of the
waters, when they divided Africa from America.
This is a natural cause; and similar causes might
be conceived which would produce the same ef∣fect.
For example, if the sea should make an
irruption into Asia from east to west, and sepa∣rate
the southern regions of Africa and Asia from
the rest of the Continent, all the animals peculiar
to these countries, as the elephant, the rhinoce∣ros,
the giraffe, the zebra, the orang-outang, &amp;c.
would be in the same situation with those of
South America. They would be entirely sepa∣rated
from those of the temperate regions, and
could not be referred to an origin common to
any of the species or genera which inhabit these
countries, solely because some imperfect resem∣blances
might be discovered between them.</P>
<P>Hence, to discover the origin of these animals,
we must have recourse to the period when the
two Continents were united, and trace the first
changes which have happened on the surface of
the earth. We must, at the same time, consider the
two hundred species of quadrupeds as constituting
thirty-eight families: And, though this is by no
means the present state of nature, but, on the
<PB N="452" REF="524"/>
contrary, a state of much greater antiquity, which
we can reach only by inductions and relations
almost equally fugitive as time, that seems to have
effaced their traces; we shall, however, endea∣vour
to ascend, by facts and monuments still ex∣isting,
to those first ages of Nature, and to exhi∣bit
those epochas which shall appear to be most
clearly indicated.</P>
