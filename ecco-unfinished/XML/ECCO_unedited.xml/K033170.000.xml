<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>WHOEVER has read the very entertaining collection of Moral Tales, lately published by M. Marmontel, will immediately discover, that the first hint of this little piece was taken from the episode of Lindor, in the SCRUPULE; and the ridiculous conceit of being beloved <HI>for one's own sake, for one's self alone,</HI> is also admirably exposed in the first of those Tales, called ALCIBIADE, <HI>ou, le</HI> MOI.</P>
<P>That part of the fable which relates to Mademoiselle Florival, is taken, with some alteration, from a Story, originally publish∣ed in one of the numbers of the British Magazine, and said to be founded on fact.</P>
<P>After these acknowledgements, nothing farther remains but to return thanks to the Public for the very favourable reception they have given to this little piece, and to the Performers for their great care and uncommon excellen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in the representa∣tion.</P>

<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>BE assured that I will do every thing in my power to serve you; my brother knew that he might command my ser∣vices:—be comforted, I beseech you, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORIVAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cannot wonder, Madam, that I should be shocked, extremely shocked, at the cruel necessity of appearing before you in so indelicate a disguiise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed you need not; there is something in your manner which convinces me, that every action of your life carries its apology along with it; though I will not venture to enquire into the particulars of your story, 'till your mind is more at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase.</P>

<SPEAKER>FLORIVAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, Madam, it is my interest to make you acquainted with my story. I am the daughter of Monsieur Florival, a French physician, in the island of Belleisle.—An English officer, who had been desperately wounded, was, after the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>apitulation, for the sake of due attendance, taken into my father's house, and as I, in the very early part of my life, had resided in Eng∣land, he took some pleasure in my conversation: In a word, he won my affections, and asked me of my father in marriage; but he, alas! too much influenced by the narrow prejudices so common between the two nations, forbad the officer his house; but not before we were, by the most solemn engagements, secretly con∣tracted to each other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I ask the officer's name?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORIVAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse me, Madam! 'Till I see, or hear from him once more, my prudence, vanity, or call it what you will, will scarce suffer me to mention it. Your brother, indeed, is acquainted with—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your pardon—I hope, however, you have no reason to think yourself neglected or forgotten?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORIVAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! no, far from it. He was soon recalled by orders from England; and on my father's pressing me to consent to another match, my
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
passion—I blush to own it—transported me so far, as to depart abruptly from Belleisle. I came over in an English ship to Portsmouth, where I expected, according to letters he had contrived to send me, to find the officer. But judge of my disappointment, when I learnt that he embarked but three days before for the siege of the Havannah.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Havannah! you touch me nearly—Pray go on!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORIVAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>In a strange kingdom—alone—and a woman—what could I do? In order to defeat enquiries after me, I disguised myself in this habit, and mixt with the officers of the place; but your brother soon discovered my uneasiness, and saw through my disguise. I frankly confessed to him every particular of my story; in conse∣quence of which, he has thus generously re∣commended me to your protection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you may depend on my friendship—Your situation affects me strangely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORIVAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Madam, it is impossible to tell you half its miseries: especially since your brother has convinced me, that I am so liable to be dis∣covered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall throw off that dress as soon as possible, and then I will take you into the house
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
with me and my sister—In the mean time let me see you every day—every hour. I shall not be afraid that your visits will affect my reputa∣tion.</P>

me a soldier, that looks as if he cou'd love me and protect me; ay, and tame me too, if I de∣serv'd it—If I was to have this thing for a hus∣band, I wou'd set him at the top of my India cabinet with the China figures, and bid the maid take care she did not break him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well; if this is the case, I don't know what my brother will say to you. Here's his letter! Read it; and send him an answer your∣self.</P>

<P>Dear sister, the bearer of this letter is a lady! <HI>So, so! your servant, madam!—and your's too, sister!</HI>—whose case is truly compassionate, and whom I most earnestly recommend to your pro∣tection,—<HI>um—um—um</HI>—take care of her—<HI>um—um—um</HI>—not too many questions—<HI>um—um—um</HI>—in town in a few days. <HI>I'll be whipped now, if this is not some mistress of his.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, Bell, I know her whole history; It is quite a little novel. She is a French woman, Mademoiselle Florival, run away from her fa∣ther at Belleisle, and dying for an English gen∣tleman at the Havannah.</P>

<P>The Havannah!—Not for Col. Tamper, I hope, sister;</P>

<P>From Col. Tamper!—What can this mean! I am ready to sink with fear—Why does not he come himself?</P>

<P>He's not arrived—Not come to town yet,—I suppose.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Bell! I could suppose twenty things that terrify me to death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think now such a message ought to put you quite out of your pain; he could not come from Col. Tamper, if there was no such person in being.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but suppose any accident should have happened to him! Heaven forbid! How unfor∣tunate is it to doat upon a man, whose profes∣sion exposes him hourly to the risk of his life!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Emily, how can you torment yourself with such horrid imaginations? Besides, should the worst come to the worst—it is but a lover lost, and that is a loss easily repaired, you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go, you mad-cap! but you'll pay for all this one day, I warrant you. When you come <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be heartily in for it yourself, Bell, you will know that when a pure and disinterested passion fills the breast, when once a woman has set her heart upon a man, nothing in the world but that very man will ever make her happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I admire your <HI>setting your heart,</HI> as you call it, of all things. Your love, my dear Emily, is not so romantick. You pitch upon a man of figure and fortune, handsome, sensible, good∣natured, and well-bred; of rank in life, and credit in his profession; a man that half the wo∣men in town would pull caps for, and then you talk like, a sly prude, of your pure and disinte∣rested passion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, I declare, if he had not a friend on earth, or a shilling in the world—if he was as miserable as the utmost malice of ill fortune could make him, I would prefer Col. Tamper to the first duke in the kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, sister! it is a mighty easy thing for per∣sons rolling in affluence, and a coach and six, to talk of living on bread and water, and the comforts of love in a cottage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The coach and six, Bell, would give little happiness to those, who could not be happy without it. When once the heart has settled its affections, how mean is it to withdraw them from any paltry considerations of what nature soever!</P>

<P>The Colonel, you know, Madam, is a man of spirit.—Having exposed his person very gallantly in the several actions before the town of the Havannah, he received many wounds; one or two of which have been attended with rather disagreeable circumstances.</P>

<P>Are not the consequences of his wounds like∣ly to endanger his life?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am satisfied.—Pray go on, Sir!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can all this mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>The two principal wounds which the Colonel received, Madam, were, one a little above the knee, and another in his face. In consequence of the first, he was reduced to the necessity of saving his life by the loss of a leg; and the lat∣ter has deprived him of the sight of an eye.</P>

<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>An eye! worse and worse—poor Colonel!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rather unfortunate, to be sure! But we should consider, Madam, that we have saved his life; and that these were sacrifices necessary for its preservation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true▪ Ay—ay—So as he has but his life, I am happy. And I ought now to be at∣tached to him, not only from tenderness, but compassion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>After all, Madam, his appearance is much better than you may imagine. His face, by the help of a black ribband, is very little dis∣figured; and he has got a false leg, made so naturally, that, except a small hitch in his gait, there is no material alteration in his person, and deportment—besides which, in point of health and spirits, he is particularly well.</P>

<P>This accident, Madam, on his own account, gives him no uneasiness; to say the truth, he seems rather vain upon it; I could wish there∣fore, when he comes, that you would not seem too deeply affected, but rather assume an air of chearfulness, lest any visible uneasiness in you should shock the Colonel.</P>

<P>You should not have followed the Major so soon, Colonel; she had scarce recovered the first shock from his intelligence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>My impatience would suffer me to delay no longer.—Why do you weep so? Emily!—Are you sorry to see me again?</P>

<STAGE>[weeping.</STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare say you are; look on me, then! What, not one glance! Won't you deign to look on your poor maimed soldier? <STAGE>[pausing]</STAGE>—Is it
<PB N="16" REF="20"/>
possible, then, that any little alteration of my person can occasion a change in your sentiments?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never, Colonel, never! It is surely no mark of want of affection to be so much hurt at your misfortunes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Misfortunes! no misfortunes at all—none at all to a soldier—nothing but the ordinary inci∣dents and common casualties of his life—marks of honour—and tokens of valour—I declare I bear them about with me as the most honourable badges of my profession—I am proud of them—I would not part with this wooden leg for the best flesh and blood in Christendom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can you really be so unconcerned at this accident?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really; and you shall be unconcerned too, Emily! You shall find more in me still, than in half the battered rakes and fops about town. It injures me, no more than it does a fine tree, to lop my branches. My trunk is heart of oak, and I shall thrive the better for it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is there no hope of recovering your eye again? Oh, we must have the best advice—Is the sight quite lost?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite—Blind as a mill-horse—blind as a beetle, Emily—but what does that signify? Love is blind, you know; and if I have lost
<PB N="17" REF="21"/>
one eye, why, they say, I shall see the clearer with the other.</P>

<P>Before the Moro castle, Ma'am, before the Moro—Hot work, hissing hot, by sea and land, I assure you, Ma'am. Ah, the Moro, the Moro!—but if men go to run their heads against stone walls, they must expect to have a sconce or two broken before they make their way through them—Eh! Major!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Major Belford was with you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>All the while. The Major and I fought side by side, cheek by jowl, 'till I fell, Ma'am! we paid the Dons—didn't we? Major!—But Velasco! poor Velasco! A fine, brave Don! must be owned—I had rather have died like Velasco, than have lived to be Generalissimo.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, prithee, Emily, be comforted! more than all this might have happened to me at home. I might have thrown away my life in a duel, or broke my neck in a fox-chase; a fit of the gout, or an apoplexy, might have maimed me ten times worse for ever; or a palsy,
<PB N="18" REF="22"/>
perhaps, have killed one half of me at a single stroke—you must not take on thus—if you do, I shall be extremely uneasy.</P>

<P>Ha, ha, ha! well, Belford, what is your opi∣nion now? Will she stand the test, or no?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>If she does, it is more than you deserve; I could wish she would give you up, with all my heart, if I did not think you would run stark mad with vexation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because, as I have often told you before, this is a most absurd and ridiculous scheme, a mere trick to impose upon yourself, and must probably end in your losing the affections of an amiable lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Belford, there is an excess of sensibility in my temper—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>That will always make you unhappy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rather say it will ensure the future happiness of my life. Before I bind myself to abide by a woman, at all events, and in all circumstances, I must be assured that she will at all events, and in all circumstances, retain her affection for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>S'death, I have not patience to hear you. Have not you all the reason in the world to rest assured, that Emily entertains a most sincere passion for you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps so; but then I am not equally as∣sured of the basis on which that passion is founded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her folly, I am afraid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="20" REF="24"/>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but I am serious, Major.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very ridiculous, Colonel!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well! it does not signify talking; I must be convinced that she loves me <HI>for my own sake,</HI> for <HI>myself</HI> alone; and that were I divested of every desirable gift of fortune, and of nature, and she was to be addressed by fifty others, who possessed them all in the most eminent degree, she would still continue to prefer me to all the rest of mankind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most precious refinement, truly! This is the most high-flown metaphysics in sentiment I ever heard in my life.—Picked up in one of your expeditions to the coast of France, I suppose—No plain Englishman ever dreamed of such a whim—Love you for <HI>yourself!</HI> for <HI>your own sake!</HI>—not she truly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>How then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, for her <HI>own,</HI> to be sure—and so would any body else.—I am your friend, and love you as a friend; and why? because I am glad to have commerce with a man of talents, honour, and honesty. Let me once see you behave like a poltroon, or a villain, and you know I would cut your throat, Colonel!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't doubt you, Major! But if she don't love me for my <HI>own</HI> sake, for <HI>myself,</HI> as I said, how can I ever be certain, that she will not transfer that love to another?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="21" REF="25"/>
<SPEAKER>BELFORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>For your <HI>own</HI> sake! for <HI>yourself</HI> again! Why, what in the name of common sense is this <HI>self</HI> of yours, that you make such a rout about? your birth, your fortune, your character, your talents, and perhaps, sweet Colonel, that sweet person of yours—all these may have taken her—and habitude, and continual intercourse must encrease her partiality for them in you, more than in any other person. But after all, none of these things are <HI>yourself.</HI> You are but the ground, and these qualities are woven into your frame. Yet it is not the stuff, but the richness of the <HI>work,</HI> that stamps a value on the piece.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why this is downright sermonizing, Major! Give you pudding sleeves, and a grizzle wig, you might be chaplain to the regiment: Yet matrimony is a leap in the dark, indeed, if we cannot before-hand make ourselves at all certain of the fidelity and affection of our wives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELFORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marriage is precarious, I grant you, and must be so. You may play like a wary gamester, 'tis true. I would not marry a notorious profligate, nor a woman in a consumption; but there is no more answering for the continuance of her good disposition, than that of her good health.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fine maxims! make use of them yourself: they won't serve me: A fine time, indeed, to experience a women's fidelity—after marriage; a time when every thing conspires to render it her interest to deceive you! No, no, no fool's paradise for me, Belford!</P>

<P>I am much better than I was, I thank you; heigho!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PRATTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, I knew we should be better by and by.—These little nervous disorders are very common all over the town—merely owing to the damp weather, which relaxes the tone of the whole system.—The poor duchess of Porce∣lain has had a fever on her spirits these three weeks: Lady Teizer's case is absolutely hysteri∣cal; and Lady Betty Dawdle is almost half mad with lowness of spirits, head-aches, tremblings, vain fears, and wanderings of the mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Mr. Prattle, how does poor Miss Crompton do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PRATTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never better, Ma'am! somebody has remov∣ed her disorder, by prescribing very effectually to the Marquis of Cranford. His intended match with Miss Richman, the hundred thousand pound fortune, is quite off, and so, Ma'am, Miss Crom∣pton is perfectly well again.—By the bye too, she has another reason to rejoice; for her cousin
<PB N="26" REF="30"/>
Miss Dorothy, who lives with her, and began, you know, to grow rather old-maidish, as we say, Ma'am, made a sudden conquest of Mr. Bumper, a Lancashire gentleman of a great estate, who came up to town for the Christmass, and they were married at Miss Crompton's yes∣terday evening.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it true, Mr. Prattle, that Sir John Medley is going to the south of France for the recovery of his health?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PRATTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, Ma'am, very true, that he's going, I promise you; but not for the recovery of his health; Sir John's well enough himself, but his affairs are in a galloping consumption, I assure you. No less than two executions in his house. I heard it for fact at Lady Modish's. Poor gen∣tleman! I have known his chariot stand at Ar∣thur's till eight o'clock in the morning. He has had a sad run a long time, but that last af∣fair at Newmarket totally undid him.—Pray, ladies, have you heard the story of Alderman Manchester's lady?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, no. Pray what is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PRATTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A terrible story indeed.—Eloped from her husband, and went off with Lord John Sprightly. Their intention, it seems, was to go over to Holland; but the Alderman pursued them to Harwich, and catched them just as they were going to embark. He threatened Lord John with a prosecution, but Lord John, who knew the Alderman's turn, came down with a thousand pounds, and so the Alderman received his wife, and all is well again.</P>

<P>I vow, Mr. Prattle, you are extremely amus∣ing. You know the chit-chat of the whole town.</P>

<P>Can't avoid picking up a few slight anecdotes, to be sure, Ma'am—Go into the best houses in town—Attend the first families in the kingdom—Nobody better received—Nobody takes more care—Nobody tries to give more satisfaction.</P>

<P>Is there any public news of any kind, Mr. Prattle?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so? Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PRATTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because, Ma'am, if he lost a leg and an eye at the Havannah, they must be grown again, or he has somehow procured others, that do the business every whit as well.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible!</P>

<P>I wish I may die, Ma'am, if the Colonel had not yesterday two as good legs and fine eyes as any man in the world. If he lost one of each at the Havannah, we practitioners in physic should be much obliged to him to communicate his receipt for the benefit of Greenwich and Chelsea Hospitals.</P>

<P>After all, Bell, I must confess that this strata∣gem has convinced me of the infirmity of my temper. This supposed accident began to make strange work with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I saw that plain enough. I told you what your <HI>pure and disinterested passion,</HI> sister, would come to, long ago.—Yet this is so flagrant an af∣front, I would make him smart for it some way or other; I would not marry him these seven years.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh you're in charming spirits, sister!—But Captain Johnson! you abound in the military, Captains, Colonels, and Majors, by wholesale: who is Captain Johnson? pray!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only the name that Mademoiselle Florival, the Belleisle lady you saw this morning, goes by.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, sister, the luckiest thought in the world—Such a use to make of this lady!</P>

<P>Hush! here she is.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Mademoiselle <HI>Florival.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me leave, Madam, to introduce you to my sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard your story, Madam, and take part in your misfortunes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORIVAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am infinitely obliged both to you and to that Lady, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Madam, I have been extremely ill since you was here this morning, and terrified almost beyond imagination.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORIVAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very sorry to hear it; may I ask what has alarmed you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is so ridiculous, I scarce know how to tell you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I will. You must know, Ma'am, that my sister was engaged to an officer, who went out on a late military expedition. He is just re∣turned, but is come home with the strangest conceit that ever filled the brain of a lover. He took it into his head to try my sister's faith by pretending to be maimed and wounded, and has actually visited her this morning in a counterfeit character. We have just now de∣tected the imposition, and want your assistance to be pleasantly revenged on him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORIVAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot bring myself to be an advocate for the Lady's cruelty—But you may both com∣mand me in any thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="34" REF="38"/>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no cruelty in the case I fear; I am gone too far for that. As you are in appearance such a smart young gentleman, my sister has waggishly proposed to make you the instrument of exciting Colonel Tamper's jealousy, by your personating the character of a supposed rival.—Was not that your device? sister!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was; and if this Lady will come into it, and you play your part well, we'll tieze the wise colonel, and make him sick of his rogueries, I warrant you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORIVAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been a mad girl in my time, I confess, and remember when I should have joined in such a frolick with pleasure. At present, I fear I am scarce mistress enough of my temper, to maintain my character with any tolerable hu∣mour. However, I will summon up all my spirits, and do my best to oblige you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! you will have but little to do—The business will lie chiefly on your hands, Emily.—You must be most intolerably provoking—If you do but irritate him sufficiently, we shall have charming sport with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never fear me, Bell. Mr. Pattle's intelligence has given me spirits equal to any thing—Now I know it is but a trick, I shall scarce be able to see him limping about without laughing.—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>This it is to have new servants! Not at home indeed!—A pack of blockheads, to think of denying my Emily to me. I knew the poor dear soul was a little out of order indeed,—but—<STAGE><HI>[seeing</HI> Florival.]</STAGE> I beg pardon, Madam! I did not know you had company.</P>
</SP>

<P>Madam! a message! for what reason?</P>

<P>Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>S'death! I have not power to speak to her.—This strange and sudden alteration in your be∣haviour, Madam—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alteration! none at all, Sir: the change is on your side, not mine. I'll be judg'd by this gentleman.—Captain Johnson, here's a minia∣ture of the Colonel, which he sat for just before he went abroad—done by a good hand, and reckoned a striking likeness.—Did you ever see a poor creature so altered? <STAGE>[giving a bracelet.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORIVAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, really, Madam, there is, I must own, a very visible difference at present—That black ribband <STAGE>[looking by turns on the picture and Col. <HI>Tamper]</HI></STAGE> makes a total eclipse of the brilliancy of this right eye—and then the irregular motion of the leg, gives such a twist to the rest of the body, that—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir!—But it is to you I address myself at present, Madam!—I was once fond and foolish enough to imagine, that you had a heart truly generous and sensible, and flattered myself that it was above being shaken by absence, or affected by events.—How have I been deceived! I find that—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, Sir! I never deceived you:—nay, you see that I disdained the thoughts of deceiv∣ing
<PB N="37" REF="41"/>
you even for a day.—Out of respect to our late mutual attachment, I am resolved to deal openly with you. In a word then, every thing between us must now be at an end.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Confusion!—Every thing at an end! and can you, you, Emily, have the courage to tell me so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why not? Come, come, Col. Tamper, vani∣ty is your <HI>blind side.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds, Madam!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't be in a passion!—Do but consider the matter calmly: and though it may rather be displeasing, yet when you have duly weighed all circumstances, I'm sure you must do me the justice to acknowledge my sincerity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall run mad—Is it possible, Emily!—Sincerity do you call this?—Dissimulation,—damn'd dissimulation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have patience, Sir! The loss of your whole fortune would have been trifling to me; but how can I reconcile myself to this mangling of your figure?—Let me turn the tables on you for a moment! suppose now, Colonel, that I had been so unfortunate as to have lost a leg and an eye, should you, d'ye think, have re∣tained your affection inviolable for me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>False, false woman!—Have a care, Emily! have a care, I say, or you'll destroy your fame and happiness for ever.—Consider what you are doing, e'er you make a final resolution.—You'll repent your inconstancy, I tell you before∣hand—Upon my soul, you will—You'll have

more reason to repent it, than you can possibly imagine!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why will you oblige me now to say shocking things to you? It goes against me to tell you so, but I can't even see you now, without hor∣ror; nay, was I even, from a vain point of ho∣nour, to adhere to my engagements with you, I could never conquer my disgust.—It would be a most unnatural connection.—Wou'd not it? Captain Johnson!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hell! s'death! confusion!—How steadily she persists in her perfidy! Madam!—Madam!—I shall choak with rage—But one word, and I am gone for ever—for ever, for ever! Madam!</P>

<P>What would you say? Sir!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell me then—and tell me truly! Have not you received the addresses of that gentleman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has honoured me with them, I confess, Sir! And every circumstance is so much in his favour, that I could have no manner of objec∣tion to him, but my unfortunate engagements to you—But since your ill fortune has invin∣cibly divorced us from each other, I think I am at liberty to listen to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TAMPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Matchless confidence!—mighty well, Madam!—It is not then the misfortunes that have befal∣len me, but the charms you have found in that gentleman, which have altered your inclination.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLORIVAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir! and what then? Sir! The Lady, I presume is not included, like an old mansion∣house, in the rent-roll of your estate, or the in∣ventory of your goods and chattels. Her hand,
<PB N="39" REF="43"/>
I hope, is still her own property, and she may bestow it on you, or me, or any body else; just as she pleases.</P>

<P>If you meant to separate yourself from me, you have indeed taken an excellent method. And a mighty proof you have given of your <HI>own</HI> affection, truly!

<P>I am bound to them for ever.
