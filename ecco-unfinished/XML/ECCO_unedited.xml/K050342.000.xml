<HEAD>A Seasonable Caution to the Gene∣ral ASSEMBLY.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">IN A LETTER FROM A Member of Parliament of <HI>North Britain,</HI> to a Minister in <HI>Scot∣land:</HI> Occasioned by the House of Lords Reversing the Sen∣tence of Mr. <HI>Greenshiels.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I make no Question, but the First Accounts you will have of what has past here, in the upper House of Parliament will be very surprizing both to you and many others, and the more so for two Reasons.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The Misrepresentations and Agravati∣ons, with which those People tell the Story,
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
who either to make their Triumph over you the greater, or to encrease your Disorder, at the News, have given a most unfair and falfe Account of it.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Apprehensions and Fears you may have of the Consequences of it, and of the farther Impositions of this kind, which may follow.</P>
<P>For this Reason I thought it might be Usefull, to enter a little into the State of things with you, by way of Letter, and to Enquire or rather Consider, what is the proper Duty of us and our People in <HI>Scotland</HI> who have the Interest and Liberties, both of the Church, and People of <HI>Scotland</HI> most at Heart. What is best for us to do, and how to behave both with Re∣spect to the <HI>Government,</HI> with resp ct to the <HI>Church,</HI> and with respect to <HI>Our Selves,</HI> and our <HI>Posterity.</HI></P>
<P>I make no Professions here of my Sincerity to, and Zeal for the true Interest of the Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> I hope my Behaviour, in all past Occasions, wherein the Church has been Concern'd, will Vindicate me, to those that know me, and to those that do not know me what I shall write on this Occasion shall speak both for it self and for me.</P>
<P>I am far from Desiring, that any Man should Aban∣don the Interest of the Church, I wish some who Profess an extraordinary concern at this thing, now it is past, had Appeared more Concern'd to prevent it, when it was in their Power; and not Contented themselves with a Superficial light Opposition, hardly enough to justifie their saying they Opposed it, when a Faithfull Vigorous withstanding this unjust At∣tempt had not been their duty only, but was a debt to their sacred Promises when in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and might per∣haps have been effectual to have warded of this Blow, the Consequences of which, I doubt they will shew as little Concern to prevent as they did the Cause.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
I am not therefore perswading any Man to Abandon or forsake the true Interest of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> much less to give up any the least of her Priviledges and establish't Rights; least of all, would I have you either Disponding or Discouraged in the Apprehensi∣ons of your Case being Abandoned and Desperate, gi∣ven up to your Enemies, or they strengthened to Insult and Invade you.</P>
<P>Yet on the other hand, I should be very Sorry to See Rash and Hot Measures, Furious Refentments, and Violent Tempers Run you out to any Steps, that either may widen this Breach, or seem to lay more stress upon it than the Nature of the Thing calls for, and the Main Reason, I will not say the only Rea∣son is, because I would not give your Enemies the Ad∣vantage against you, that generally are the Effect of Rash and Hasty Resentments, or Expose your selves to the Censure of those who Boast so much over our Country Men, for the Violence and Ungovernd Fury of their Zeal.</P>
<P>In order therefore to find out the safe and middle Way, which the Friends of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and those that love and regard her Interest, ought to take in this nice juncture, I shall enquire into, and state the Several Particulars of this matters, as Im¦partially as I can.</P>
<P>When the Appeal of <HI>Greenshiels</HI> against the Sen∣tence of the Lords of Session, and Magistrates of <HI>E∣dinburgh,</HI> First came into Debate, in the House of Peers. The first Question which came to be debated in that House was the Legality of the Appeal.</P>
<P>It is too true a saying, that <HI>Absence Exposes to In∣jury,</HI> and I confess I have often thought, there ought to have been some Agent from <HI>Scoland</HI> there, to have Vindicated the Rights of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to have pleaded against the bringing a Sentence of the
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> before a Civil Judicature of any kind. The said Church having a Soveraign Judica∣ture of their own, in which the Queen being always present by her Commissioner, Matters are Determi∣ned without any Appeal, except to the Bar of <HI>Heaven:</HI> For every Court where the Queen is present, in such a manner, is a Soveraign Judicature; and the Peculiar of a Soveraign Judicature is this, That it admits of no Appeal; for to Appeal from it to the House of Peers; is to Appeal from a Soveraign Judicature, to a Soveraign Judicature, which is Inconsistency and Nonsence.</P>
<P>There was a Noble Lord of our own Coun∣try, and one of our Sixteen, who took much P ms to prove, That our Church notwithstanding the U<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣on, the Act of Security, or any other of former <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utho∣ritys, Acts of Parliament, or established Priviled<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es was entirely subject to the Government of the Civil Power, That the Supremacy of the Crown, in Ca∣ses Ecclesiastick was never Repealed or Destroyed in <HI>Scotland:</HI> And much Pains his Lorship took to bring it in the Power of the House of Peers, to Determine of all Matters relating to Our Church. The Design was evident (viz) That by the same Rule it lay in the Power of the House of Lords to Alter, Change, or Turn the Government of our Church, from E∣piscopal to Presbyterian, and from Presbyterian to Episcopal, as they should find Cause.</P>
<P>But this Noble Lord's pious Endeavours did not Succeed according to his d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sire, and the House made no Motion that way.</P>
<P>As to the Case before them it was judged after some Debate, That the Appeal was regular and that the House of Peers, had a right to take cognizance of that Affair: I do acknowledge there seems some diffi∣culty to us, who live in North Britain, about the
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
justice of any Court determining for themselves, Whether such or such matters come under their jurisdiction o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no, since no Court will, or but very rarely Vote away their own Power.</P>
<P>I mention all this for this Reason, That you may take notice, that although the Lords did pass it in the Affirmative, in favour of their own Power, that the Appeal did lye before them: Yet they did it, not as <HI>an Ecclesiastick</HI> but as <HI>a Civil</HI> cause. So that the Que∣stion, Whether an Appeal Lies from the General As∣sembly, or from the Church Judicatorie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to the House of Peers, a Question on which all our Church Priviledges depends, has not in the least been concern d in this Affair, but remains as much in Question as it did before.</P>
<P>This I thought necessary to hint, in order to quiet the clamours, and make Easie the Minds of some well meaning, but rash People, who think and have been too forward to spread it about, That the House of Lords have taken cognizance of the Proceedings, or reverst the Sentence of the <HI>Presbytry of Edinburgh</HI> in the case of <HI>Greenshiels,</HI> and consequently have by their Precedent subjected entirely the church Ju∣dicatories of <HI>Scotland</HI> to the civil Jurisdiction.</P>
<P>As, such a <HI>Thing were it true,</HI> would justly Alarm us all, and give us good Reason to Fear the Overthro' of our Ecclesiastick constitution, so nothing is of more Pernicious consequence, and more destructive to our Peace, nothing can better gratify, or indeed serves the Interest of our Enemys, than to have our People amu∣sed with, and Imposed upon to Entertain such a Re∣port, when as in truth, there was no such Thing Transacted in the House, nay that rather by the Pro∣ceedings, there seems to be a tacite Concession to what we all claim (viz.) That Appeals from our Church Judicatories will not lye to the said civil Power, and
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
that the House of—are not competent in the case.</P>
<P>Upon the rightly stating this Question, much of our present concern about, and Uneasiness at what has happened will depend; And therefore, it is the more studied by our Enemies to be concealed, and the con∣trary to be Suggested.</P>
<P>The Party who triumph in this Victory, are mighty willing to have it called a Victory over our Church, and to Possesses our People That the Sentence of the Church against <HI>Greenshiels</HI> in this Case, is Effectually Reverst, That the Episcopal People have from hence a Tacite Unlimited Liberty to set up what Forms of Worship, and bring in what Innovations they please, and that the Church Judicatories are hereby Forbid∣den to meddle with them, an Article which would by the same Parity of Reason Disarm the Discipline, and Unhinge the Constitution of our Church.</P>
<P>And the chief Reason that I can See, why they strive to make this pass for Current among us, is That they may provoke, Exasperate, and Push on the less prudent part of our People to any Disorders and Vio∣lent Methods of Expressing their Resentment.</P>
<P>But when it shall be set before the good People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> That our Church Judicatories still remain Un touch't, That the House of Lords notwithstanding the Mock Oratory of my Lord B—and the warm En deavours of some others of our Country Men, to per∣swade them to fall upon us, have yet been so far from touching upon the Sentence of the <HI>Presbytrie,</HI> That they did in a Manner own they had no Power to take Cognizance upon that Point, and therefore that when a Motion was made to that purpose it was rejected: When these things come to be considered by them, as the Triumphs of the one side will be greatly Lessened, and their hopes of making us Desperate be Disappoint∣ed;
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
So I hope the Uneasiness of our Friends will be much abated, and they will see, That as all is not lost that is in hazard, so what these People have gotten in the Victory they boast of, is not of a Consequence e∣quall to the Shouts and Rejoycings, they have made for it.</P>
<P>It is true, and I am very sorry for it, That the Re∣versing the Sentence of the Magistrates, and of the Lords of Session in this Case, is a taking off in some Measure the Edge of the Sentence of the Church, in so far as the civil Magistrates are of themselves backward enough, and it's probable may now be more backward, to put in Execution the Censures and Sentences of the Church, as being discouraged in the doing their Duty by this Resolution of the Lords.</P>
<P>But I see no Reason why this should by the Conse∣quence of such a Thing any more than the Lords of the Session, or the Lord Chancellor in <HI>England</HI> should be backward or discouraged in pursuing their Senten∣ces and Decrees in other Civil Matters, because They are liable to be likewise revers'd in the House of Lords.</P>
<P>It is no question the Duty of the Magistrates ac∣cording to the Act of Parliament in that Case, Enti∣tuled, <HI>An Act to oblige the Civil Magistrates to put in Execution the Censures and Sentences of the Church,</HI> to stand by, and Support the Indicatories of the Church with their Authority according to Law; and they are as much under an Obligation to do it now as ever, nor could the Magistrates answer it, not to do just the same thing a <HI>Second</HI> and a <HI>Third</HI> Time if Circumstan∣ces concern'd, and the same offered tho' by an Appeal the other Party should every time obtain a Reverse of their Seneence in the House of Lords; And if this were Offensive, some new Act must be made in Parlia∣ment to Limit and Direct the said Magistrates in such
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
a case, but till such Law is made, the present Law is in Force and binds them to the same Duty as much as it did before.</P>
<P>This therefore is to be observed, That the Peers of great Britain having considered the Commitment of <HI>Greenshiels</HI> and Reverst it, does not at all disable and consequently ought not to discourage any Magistrate from acting in their Station according to Law, it only Extends to this particular Case in which, whether some Omission, some Slip or some illegal Step has been made is not for me to Examine here, their Lordships not suffering their proceedings to be printed, or Examin∣ed in print by any Body: But if in another Case which may come before them, such slip or Omission or illegal Step can not be found, such other case will receive no Prejudice from this.</P>
<P>This hint I think needfull on many Accounts, as well to quiet the Minds of our People in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who may be Imposed upon, whether by their own Fears, or by the Artifice of others to think, That not only the Church Judicatories have been Attackt, and their Sen∣tences Reverst in these Proceedings, but that the civil Magistrate is hereby disabled from any farther share in the Executive Power and is effectually discharg d from concerning himself in putting those Censures and Sentences in Execution.</P>
<P>There is no Question but the Party who have set <HI>Greenshiels</HI> to work, and have from the beginning en∣couraged and supported him would be very willing to have us take Things in this Sense, because they hope it may tend to the Enraging and Exasperating some Spirits among us, who may be forward to take wrong Measures, in this case, upon such a Supposition.</P>
<P>But as they are mistaken in the thing it self, so I hope they shall be disappointed in the design, and the warmest of our Friends, I doubt not will see reason to
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
calm themselves so much, and Preserve their Temper in this case, by how much it is plain, they have lost no Legal Power that they had before, nor are the Magi∣strates at all the less Empowered to put the Laws in Execution, by this Proceeding than they were before.</P>
<P>I am not going about to Examine in this case, whe∣ther the House of Lords have done us justice or no: There is perhaps no sentence of any kind confirm'd or reverst but the Persons who lose their cause, are apt to say or think they have not justice done them, and if I am askt my Opinion, perhaps I may think so in this case, especially what had been done having been Ap∣proved as Law, by our Highest Court of civil justice, and by the Act of our <HI>Privy Council,</HI> when we had one. But I am not enquiring now into what Injury we have received, or whether we have received injury or no; But into <HI>What is next sor us to do,</HI> What is before us, and how we ought to behave, after this Surprizing Event, both the Supporting our Rights, Discharging our Duty, and Disappointing our Ene∣mies, who wait for our Misbehaving our selves, with Eager Hopes of making some advantage of our Un∣easinesses.</P>
<P>The first thing therefore in order to our regular Conduct in this Affair, is to Examine speaking of the Church; Have we lost any of our Rights? Are the hands of our Discipline weakned? Are any of our Fun∣damentals Invaded? And have we received any real Damage?</P>
<P>This Question seems most proper to be first decid∣ed, because so much of the fears of our Friends de∣pends upon the Affirmative of this Question.</P>
<P>I make no scruple therefore to answer in the Nega∣tive, and that directly; And to make this out I shall prove.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="12" REF="11"/>
1. That no Law is repealed, by which the Power of the Rights of the Church were E∣stablished or supported, so by the way Rever∣sing a sentence, is not repealing a Law.</P>
<P N="2">2. No Power is taken from the Church, by which it had either it's Discipline or Govern∣ment supported; And if any Man Invade you in your jurisdiction, you have the same power which you had before.</P>
<P>The whole of this Matter is, there SEEMS to be a tacite Prohibition of the Magistrates from the like Proceedings: I say, SEEMS, for it is no more, and as I said before, if the same Invasion of their Discipline and Government be made, they ought to do every Le∣gal thing to support and maintain it, which they have done already, and if the Person be aggrieved he may as the other did, appeal. The Lords, it's true, may in∣deed reverse agai#, and to these Renewings, Pleadings, and Appeals will seem to have no end.</P>
<P><HI>I Answer,</HI> yes, They will have this End, you have your Method of Justice prescribed by a Law; Till that Law is Repealed, tho' the Lords were to Reverse the Proceedings every time, yet you must go by the Rule prescribed, and in time perhaps the Judicature of Peers will offer some Law to regulate these proceedings, that we may know how far our Liberty may be asserted, and how far not.</P>
<Q><L>And the Reason lies here,</L></Q>
<P>The Proceedings of the Church are bound by the Laws. <HI>First,</HI> of God, and <HI>Then</HI> of the Nation; The Di∣scipline and Government of the Church are founded, <HI>First,</HI> on the Laws of God, and are <HI>Then</HI> Establisht by the Laws of our Country, which Laws are secured, and reconfirm'd to us, by the Union, and the Act of Securi∣ty, made also a part of that Union.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12"/>
Now the Lords having not at all meddled with our Church Sentence, as having no Jurisdiction over the Ec∣clesiastick Judicatories of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which are reserv'd from them by the Treaty; <HI>It must be then,</HI> that if the Lords dislike the manner of the Civil Magistrates put∣ting in Execution the said Sentence of the Church, which by Law they are obliged to do, they must <HI>and no doubt in time they will</HI> consider of a Law, to direct the Magistrates, how and in what manner they shall do their Duty in this case; And till they do so, the Ma∣gistrates seems to me, obliged to go on in their Duty, as if no such Reverss of the late Sentence against <HI>Greenshiels</HI> had been past.</P>
<P>Having thus lav'd down the Premises, I draw this Conclusion from them,</P>
<P N="1">1. We have nothing to do then, but to wait, till such a Law shall be offered at in the House, then we shall have Room to declare our Rights, shew our Claim and have a fair hearing for what we shall demand, and the Union will be the Test, by which the Authority the Lords have in this case shall be tryed.</P>
<P N="2">2. All the Pretences those Gentle-Men have, for Enflaming and Exasperating our People to fall upon <HI>Greenshiels,</HI> and his Party; If he re∣news his Attempt, are taken away; For by this Rule <HI>which I am sure is right,</HI> if he makes the like Attempt, he must go the same way, to the same place, and be delivered by the same Method, as he was before; and so to the end of the chapter, till the Parliament shall think fit to repeal the Law, which obliges the Magistrates to put in execution the Sentences and Censures of the Church, for a Law remains always in force, till it is repealed by the same Authority which made it, and that will be hard to be found in this case.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="14" REF="13"/>
3. All ground for our Fears and Disorders cease in this very Principle, for while your Laws are the same, and are not at all enervated, or weakned by this Decree of the House of Lords, then we have no more occasion to run into Excesses, Violence, or popular Heat, than we had before.</P>
<P>Doubtless it is our business to wait, and <HI>look on,</HI> to see what the Enemies of our Peace will do, see what use they will venture to make of this supposed Victory: If they think by this that they are Tollerated to Insult the Church▪ and Ruffle the Magistrates, contemn the Authority of the Laws, and Defy the Executive Power of the Magistrates; you may still in a legal way let them see they are mistaken, and if they are tyred of being an∣nually sent up to the House of Lords for Redress, they must get a Law made, to authorize themselves to go on their own Way, if they can, against which Law, no question but we shall be heard.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>Reverend Sir,</HI> I think all our Fears, and the sur∣prize of this matter may fall to the ground, and we have no reason to think of any violent Measures.</P>
<P>I know we are represented in the World as a Furi∣ous, and Ungovernable People, and it is remarkable that these People who are forwardest to cast that reproach upon us are the forwardest also to try all possible ways to provoke us, pushing daily at our constitution, and urging us to these Violences they would lay to our Charge, as the native Crime of our Peoples Temper, and we are not without Testimony, how much rather they would have <HI>Greenshiels</HI> disturb'd by the Mob, than by the Magistrates, by the Flame and Fury of the Street, than by the soft Fire <HI>of the Law;</HI> and how much they appeared disappointed that they could not raise Fermentation enough in the People, to bring it to pass;
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
which they would have made their uses of, and their Advantage over us would have appeared many ways; But the Wisdom of Providence directed otherwise, and we thank God with much Reason, that they have been disappointed.</P>
<P>It is true, that had our Exasperated People took Fire, upon the just Provocations, given them in that Case of <HI>Greenshiels,</HI> the Crime had received much Al∣leviation in this South Part of the Island, from the Ex∣ample of a Party here has set to their Brethren, where without any Provocation on the side of the Dissenters, the Rabbles that were raised by the Friends of <HI>Dr. Sa∣cheverel</HI> fell upon the Meeting-Houses, and ransack'd and demolished them, and committed the accustomed Violences, that makes such Things really odious to all the Lovers of a Legal Constitution.</P>
<P>And I name this the rather, for that it may not only let those People see what their Friends practise has been in like Cases; but to let us all see how Destructive Mobs and Street Violences have always been, and ever will be to the Party that put them in practice, since those very Tumults, tho' they alarm'd and surpriz'd the Diffenters very much for the time, yet they had the Satisfaction of seeing them condemn'd and dis∣own'd both by her Majesty, the Parliament, and the Publick Justice of the Nation; and not only so, but those very Mobs, and that Tumultuous Method of that Party, has tended to their own Disadvantage; the length that Dr. <HI>Sacheverel</HI> and his Abbettors went in that part, having procur'd him a general Neglect and Contempt among the very People who were otherwise for him, with whom he now grows a forgotten aban∣don'd Thing, not fit to be encouraged.</P>
<P>Nor could the Laws do less then Condemn the Ex∣cesses of the People in this Case, and therefore those unhappy few that fall into the Hands of justice, were
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
of course sentenced, some to Fines, some to the Service, and others to Death, tho' her Majesty in Compassion to the poor misled Wretches, was pleased to remit that Severity.</P>
<P>From hence 'tis evident, that none but the Enemies, even of <HI>Sacheverel</HI> himself, and of his Party, could be the Prompters of those Tumults; since, on the other hand, it was Effectual to the Breach of the Na∣tions Peace; so it was the readiest way to ruin both him and his Interest, and for this Reason, as was plain to the Government, the Reproach of those Tumults was justly thrown upon the Jacobites, Papists, Non∣jurors, and Enemies to her Majesty's Person and Go∣vernment.</P>
<P>The same Interest, and the same Party in <HI>Scotland,</HI> would rejoice to see this honest People provoked to fall into Excesses of the like Nature, as what they know would be infinitely to the Disadvantage of the Presby∣terian Interest, and might in time be improved to their Destruction; and for this end was the Project of set∣ting of this despicable Tool of Innovation, set on foot, as is apparent from the Manner of Beginning, Carry¦ing on, and Concluding it.</P>
<P>It was evident from the Connivance, and Gentle∣ness of the Presbyterians in <HI>Scotland</HI> to the Episcopal Party, how many of the Episcopal Assemblies are at this day suffered, in many of which and in all that they think proper, the <HI>English</HI> Service-Book has been set up; yet they have received little or no Disturbance, and they knew that had <HI>Greenshiels</HI> thought fit to go on, as they did, he might have been wink'd at as they were; the Church having for Peace Sake, and to take off the Clamours, and pretended Complaints of their rigid Temper, which had made such Noise in <HI>England,</HI> chose rather to receive than resent an Injury.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16"/>
But this would not answer the end, which was to embroil, and enrage us, and therefore they made this Attempt, <HI>viz</HI> to Demand that of Right, which be∣fore they were content to receive as <HI>a Favour.</HI></P>
<P>This they expected would have been received as the Nature of the Insult required and as the manner they wen on indeed deserv'd, <HI>viz.</HI> with Resentment, and there wanted not Emissaries to go privately about, to endeavour to bring the People to do themselves Justice in an Extrajudicial Way.</P>
<P>But Providence intervened, and we wanted not Men of cooler Thoughts among us, who seeing the Design, disappointed it, by procuring the Address or Petition of the Inhabitants to the Presbytery, and afterwards to the Magistrates, to suppress this Insult by the Calm, and leisurely Proceedings of the Law.</P>
<P>And why else, if Tumult and Riot had not been the Design, did they industriously spread abroad Reports, that the Queen would support them, that they had her Majesty's Authority, that it was at the Request of the English Officers in the Customs, Exchequer, and the like, which was the only way to make our People be∣lieve that no Civil Power would intervene, that we could not expect any Redress from the Government, and to intimidate us from applying to the legal Cour∣ses usual in like Cases, and with all to render the En∣glish Gentlemen in general odious to the People, as the Causes of an Invasion upon their Church; all which it is plain were Delusions, and forged Pretences, her Majesty having in the first place immediately disown'd
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
the whole Design, approved the Proceedings of the Presbytery and Magistrates, and given redoubled As∣surances to both of her Gracious Resolution to main∣tain the just Rights and Liberties of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to encourage no Innovations or Invasions upon the Church: On the other hand the English Gentlemen, Officers, &amp;c. who bad at first (not knowing the Design) come into a Proposal made by <HI>Greenshiels,</HI> for setting up a Meeting House, &amp;c. as soon as ever they saw into the Design, abandoned the Party, and Cancelled the Subscription they had begun; those Gentlemen tho' they were of the Church of <HI>England</HI> in their Judgments, yet knowing better their Duty to God, and the Queen, than to be made Tools to disturb the Peace, or to cover an Attack upon the Laws, the Stipulated Constitution of the National Church, of which their Sovereign had declared her self the Protector, and Royal Preserver.</P>
<P>This tho' it may seem a Digression, is useful to let our People see of what mighty Consequence, how useful and indeed how necessary it is, and has been to the Enemies of the present Establishment of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> to bring our People if possible into Tumults, and Heats, that they may take hold of it, to ruin our Church, overturn our Constitution, and at last destroy both.</P>
<P>The Argument form'd upon this Discovery, is in short this.</P>
<P>As it was the great View of that Party to put us out of the Government of our selves in the begin∣ning
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
of this Attempt, so it appears that they aim at the same thing in every part of their Proceed∣ing since.</P>
<P>As a publick Disturbance, Breach of the Peace, and Disorder of the People, then, would have been many ways subservient to the other Designs form∣ed by our Enemies against the Peace, and against the Establishment of the Church, as well as the State in <HI>Scotland; So it would have the same or much worse Effect now.</HI></P>
<P>As all Disorders, Heats, Animosities, and Excesses, would then have been destructive to the publick establish't Peace, both of the Church and State; and would ha' been improved to the Disadvantage of the Presbyterian Interest in <HI>Scotland: So it will now.</HI></P>
<P>As the Moderation, Temper, and Justice, with which the Presbytry of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> the Magi∣strates of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and the Lds▪ of the Session, in their respective Judicatories proceeded in the Af∣fair of <HI>Mr. Greenshiels,</HI> both in Citing and Senter∣cing, as also in Executing and Confirming that Sentence, has been an HONOUR to the Natio∣nal Justice of <HI>Scotland,</HI> SATISEACTORY to their Soveraign, a VINDICATION of them against the Slander raised against them, of being Furious in Zeal, and Tumultuous in their Re∣sentment and a Compleat Disappointment of the Designs of their Enemies, who aimed at Embroil∣ing the poor abased People with the Govern∣ment; So it wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> be now.</P>

I need not Enlarge here upon the Natural Inferences from hence <HI>(viz.)</HI> That it is our Interest▪ with Calm∣ness and Prudence, to wait and give our Enemies no ad∣vantage over us by our unseasonable Resentment of Injuries, by our being more apprehensive than we need to be of their Power to do us farther harm, and by our being too much Allarm'd at the Consequences of what has happened, much less by breaking out into Violen∣ces, Breaches of the Peace, and Tumultuous doing our selves justice, in case of farther Invasion of our Rights, as if by this Action of the Lords, we were shut out from the due Reparation of the Law, and being not to expect justice from the Executive Power, were brought to the Necessity of doing our selves right, in a Summary way by Riot and Rabble.</P>
<P>This would be to fly in the Face of the Law, which is our Protection, and of the Queen, who is our gracious and Soveraign Protector, we have her Majesty's Sacred Promise to protect the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in all her Rights and Priviledges, <HI>According to the Ʋnion:</HI> Nor are we affraid of any ambiguous Construction of that word, <HI>Accor∣ding to the Ʋnion,</HI> we know our Rights and Privi∣ledges are <HI>According to,</HI> and <HI>Establish'd by the ƲNION,</HI> and the Union is so Explicite in that Establishment, that we are not to be frighted with Explications: <HI>But that is by the way.</HI></P>
<P>Her Majesty I say is the gracious Protector of our Priviledges, as well Sacred as Civil; and is so to our Church, by her Royal Promise, as well as by the Title of being our Soveraign; But her
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
Majesty is the great Protector of the Laws, the great Conservator of the publick Peace, and speak∣ing with due regard to her Royal Dignity, is bound to declare against all publick Breaches of the Peace, and the Breakers of it: Could then our Enemies have prevailed with our People, to have fallen upon <HI>Greenshiels</HI> in a Tumultuous mannner, according to what they promised them∣selves, and to obtain which, they would gladly have Sacrificed him as a Tool to their farther Designs, and for which he is much their Debtor, if he had Eyes to see it; could they I say have brought it to this, they had then Embroil'd us with our Soveraign; Engag'd us against our only protection, and driven the Interest of the Church, and the Interest of the Government, to Dash themselves to pieces against one another: Then they had had their Desire, and had nothing left for them to do, but to stand still, Clap their #hands, Cry, Hallo, and laugh at both.</P>
<P>But hitherto they have been disappointed, and un∣less a judgement from Heaven Visit us for our Chastise∣ment, they will still be disappointed; For we can not but see, if we have our Eyes open to our National Interest, that if their Hopes are built upon our disor∣der, our Hopes by Consequence which are founded u∣pon the Laws, are depending upon our peaceable Con∣duct, and our adhearing strictly to those Laws, from whence our just Cause Draws at once both Protection and Assistance.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21"/>
It is evident our Rights are Establish'd by our Laws, and therefore by the Laws we are to expect our Defence and Protection; nay, here <HI>by the Laws</HI> we expect the Support and Continuation <HI>of those Laws,</HI> for Legal Power is fruitful of its own Species, and pro∣pogates Legal Power; the Endeavours of our Enemies are not pointed so much at our immediate Relief by those Laws, <HI>tho' that is in their view also,</HI> but at the Laws themselves, could they prevail upon us in any degree, to break in upon <HI>those Laws,</HI> which are our Se∣curity; they arm themselves thereby with a just Pre∣tence to obtain, IF POSSIBLE, such Alterations, such Additions, or such Repealings of Clauses, as may Iet them in upon our Establishment: I say, IF POS∣SIBLE, because I think, as we stand it is <HI>not possible,</HI> and nothing but our destroying those Laws, or at least the Intent and Meaning of them, by our ill Conduct, can make those Alterations feazible. Hitherto the Laws are our Defence, and they have, <HI>blessed be God,</HI> defend∣ed us, and for this Reason it was that I insisted so long in the first part of this Tract, that all this Victory, which the other Party boast of, gives them no legal, and consequently no real Advantage over us; for that our Laws remain still the same, and the same Method remains open to the Magistrates, tho' their Sentence should be every time revers'd, till some <HI>New Law</HI> shall be made to ascertain the Measures of Justice, and the Methods of Execution in that Case; and how such new Law shall be obtain'd, They may inform themselves if they can.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22"/>
Hitherto I have pointed this Discourse altogether at the Affair of <HI>publick</HI> Tumult, and Disorder, such as a Breaking the Peace, Mobb, Rabble, and the like; as if I seem'd either to apprehend such a thing was the only hazard in this Case, or that it was the only view of our Enemies.</P>
<P>But there are some Excesses and Extreams, which may in their kind be as fatal to our Interest, and which perhaps are not so easie to prevent, as the Rabbles of the Street, and which would be not only as destructive to our selves, but every way as grateful to our Enemies; and <HI>These are</HI> such as may creep into our Church Judi∣catories themselves, that may undermine our Harmo∣ny in our own Proceedings, divide us against our selves, and push us on to wrong Measures in managing our own Affairs.</P>
<P>These are worst Tumults than those of the Street, require more Prudence to prevent, more Conduct to manage, and more vigour to suppress, than any Rab∣ble or Tumult whatsoever. This is the only or most fatal Thing that can befal us, and therefore is the great Concern of every Man that has at heart the Good of this Church and Nation; and this is the Occasion of my directing these Sheets to you who are A Member of the <HI>General Assembly.</HI> There is the Scene of Action; the Churches Theater, upon which all her great In∣terests are represented in Miniature, and her future Condition plac'd in perspective, on the Breath of that Reverend Body Depends <HI>under God</HI> all her present Safety; and 'tis from hence all her Members take Life and Vigour, by her Motions they move, and by her
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
Words they speak, what Temper this Assembly is in, the whole Church may be said to be in, and what Temper the Church may be in, the whole Peo∣ple may be said to be in.</P>
<P>The Members of this Assembly, if they consider the Influence, they, and all the Ministers of <HI>Scotland</HI> have, <HI>and that very deservedly too</HI> upon the Common People, will not take it ill to be Cautioned at such a time as this, to have a Care how by any wrong Step, any mis∣plac'd Word, any Loose given their own Passions, the <HI>poor People</HI> at the same time mistaking perhaps their In∣tent, <HI>may be misted.</HI></P>
<P>The Story of the Minister at <HI>Glasgow,—Ʋp and be Valiant,</HI> is too well known among us; in vain the ho∣nest peaceable Man protests he had no Thought of Ex∣citing a furious Rabble to take Arms; <HI>we all believe him,</HI> but he that has Fire in his Hands should be very careful how he goes near a Magazine of Powder, least he blow up the Garrison, while he thinks no Evil.</P>
<P>The General Assembly of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> are the Watch men plac'd upon the high Places of the Na∣tion; if they give the Alarm, no doubt we shall all be rou'd, and it cannot be an unwelcome Caution, <HI>especi∣ally while Friendly given,</HI> to take heed that no false Alarm be raised; nor is a false Alarm the only Danger, a <HI>too hasty</HI> Alarm has its Mischiefs in it also, tho' not Equal to the other, yet in the Kind as fatal; the Centinel that fires before his time discovers for the Enemy rather than for his Friends.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="24"/>
As it cannot be the Interest of the Church of <HI>Scot∣land</HI> to have her Friends asleep and thoughtless of her Danger, so to appear terrified at the Attacks of an Ene∣my, in which he has not been able to prevail, is to weaken our Hands in resisting, and Encourage them to renew those Attacks, till they do prevail. The Par∣ty that has made this Attack (as they have often done) have amused themselves, not us; they please themselves, and flatter their Friends with the Noise of a mighty Point gain'd, whereas let them examine the Fruits of their Victory, and when they have cast it up <HI>ridiculus Mus!</HI> what will it amount to? Have they gain'd an Inch of Ground? Have they taken away any one Sup∣port from the Church? Are they the better able in any one Article, unless you give up your own Strength to disturb you? Have you any less Guard or Fence from the Laws than you had before? If They think them∣selves strengthened at all by this Victory,—let us see what Improvement they can make of it; let us see what is the next Encroachment they will attempt upon you. In short, they are wise enough themselves to know they can make no Advantage of this Point gain'd, unless they can irritate, and push you on to some Inde∣cency, some Irregularity, some Extravagancies, where∣by you should expose your selves to the World, render your selves obnoxious to the Law, or lessen the Favour and Protection of your Sovereign towards you.</P>
<P>If in this they are disappointed, the Boasts of their Victory are vanisht into smoake, and they can make no Impression upon the Priviledges or Libertys of the Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> All the advantage I can forese they can make of this, is, That the Man is delivere <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the Sentence, or from any Parol, or Security
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
(had any such been given) for his appearing to an∣swer again: They boast indeed, that he will come down again to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and make another Attempt, to carry on the same design: If he does I hope you will not be at a loss, what Course to take with him, but I am not of Opinion they have gotten so much by this Attempt, as to carry the jest on any further.</P>
<P>Mean time our Business is to stand still, and see the Measures they will take, we are upon the Defensive, we have the Liberties and Priviledges of our Establish∣ment Settled by the UNION, and when they are Attackt, we are oblig'd to a legal Defence; No Man that has any Regard to the Safety, and Prosperity of the Church, can wish us not to Defend them: But let us not be Aggressors, let us not Gratify the Enemy so far, and Expose our selves to Merit that Reproach, which we say they have hitherto unjustly thrown upon us of being <HI>Hot, Rash, Furious,</HI> and <HI>Ʋngovernable.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps it may be said, these things are too Gene∣ral, let us hear what ye would say, pray Explain your self, and tell us in what we may be likely to be thus <HI>Hot,</HI> &amp;c. otherwise the Caution may be answered by saying it was needless, and to no Purpose.</P>
<P><HI>I Answer,</HI> Though I do not say that as a Body you are likely to fall into the Snare lay'd, yet as I am well Satisfied <HI>it is a Snare,</HI> and that all Men have not the same Foresight, Prudence, or Command of themselves the Caution is nevertheless Seasonable, and as all the Prudence, and all the well Government of our selves, is Necessary to Fortify us against a Waking Enemy; We cannot be too Vigilant, or too Wary to give them no Advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="26"/>
As to the particular things in which we may give the Enemy Advantage against us, and in which our pre∣sent Danger may be said to lie, I conceive they are such as these,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Breaches among our selves,</HI> Divisions and Heats as to the proper Measures to be taken, and this more especially at the great Meeting of the Ministers, and the greatest of its kind at this Time in the Protestant part of the World <HI>(viz.)</HI> the GENERAL ASSEMBLY. If Heats and Clashing, Opinions of things, should break in upon you here, they not only will put the meeting it self into unwelcome and unjustifyable Distracti∣ons; But the Confusion will Unavoidably spread over the whole Church: You are at present Famous for the most undivided Church in the World, have the fewest Opinions, He∣resies and Errours Broach't among you, the Uniformity of your <HI>Doctrine, Discipline, Worship,</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI> is the ENVY and WONDER of the Age; But if the Uni∣formity of your Councils and Conduct, with respect to the Civil Government of things is not adequate to the rest, the Dangers to the whole are inconceivable. This may Embroil you on every hand, it may Embroil you with the Laws, with the Government, with your United Neighbours, with your Episcopal E∣nemies, with the Parliament, and <HI>which would be worse</HI> with your Friends, and <HI>worst of all</HI> with your Selves: Unanimity then is your present highest Interest, in the greatest Con∣junction
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
with your selves, you have need e∣nough, of all your United strength, to resist your Aggressing and well Combin'd Enemies; But divided, every little Scoundrel will Insult you, Intrude upon your Churches, Rabble your Ministers▪ Invade your Discipline, and then Appeal to the Parliament.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Rash Measures of all kinds,</HI> I am very loath to enter into particulars here, because some of the things our Enemies promise them selves from your Resentments are such as ought not to be once named among you, and I hope shall not; all the particulars I shall name, shall be contain'd in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eads, which above all things I would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your Bretheren in this Assembly to Avoid.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Any thing Ʋndutiful</HI> or <HI>Dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ctful to Her Ma∣jesty,</HI> who, as it is evident, h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s neither been con∣cern'd in, or appears in the least satisfy'd with the Attempts made, or the Success of those At∣tempts; and <HI>from whom</HI> your Enemies, though with all their Pretences of being of the same Profes∣sion, and Principles with her Majesty, could ne∣ver obtain the least Encouragement to attack you, or intrude either upon your Properties or Privi∣ledges.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Any thing</HI> that may look like Encouraging the People to Fears and Jealousies, either of their Go∣vernment, or their Sovereign, as if Concurring in Designs against the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> in Gene∣ral, much less to any thing Tumultuous and Dis∣orderly against those that they may think are the Cont<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs of it.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="29" REF="28"/>
3. <HI>Any thing</HI> that may savour of Desperation, and abandoning the Care and Concern for the Safety of the Church, to which a legal Defence of your just Rights is your Duty, and by which those Rights may be maintain'd, as if you were denied Justice, and consequently must have Recourse to exotick Measures for your Preservation, a thing fatal to all that suffer themselves to be so imposed upon.</P>
<P>Great will be the Confusion and Disappointment of your Enemies, if none of these Things should happen; from the Hopes of these Things they promise them∣selves great Advantages, even in this Assembly; their Eyes are upon you, they watch for your halting, and they stand ready to take you at the first Slip you make; all their Agents and Emissaries are at work among you to raise Fends, to fill the Peoples Heads with Fears, to foment Jealousies, to make you believe you are given up to Destruction, and that the Government is resol∣ved to break in upon you.</P>
<P>Suspend your Belief of these Things, and wisely di∣stinguish between a Party busie to invade you, and the Governments Concurring to their Endeavours; that you have Enemies at work to undermine and over∣throw you; that they hate and malign you, are envious and enraged at your Establishment, and yet more at the late Incorporating that Establishment into the Uni∣on; this no Body doubts; nor am I going to perswade you otherwise, much less to advise you to be secure, and careless, as if it was for ever out of the Power of these Enemies to hurt you.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29"/>
But while the Queen and the Government not only are Concerned in our safety, but while both give us repeated Assurances, that they will Protect us in the Enjoyments of our just Rights, and Encourage no In∣novations or Invasions upon us, <HI>While this is our Case,</HI> it would be the Wildest thing in the World, not to do all that lay in our Power, to Engage and Oblige her Majesty and the Government, to continue that Fa∣vour and Protection, on which under God we so much depend.</P>
<P>This no way interferes with the strictest Adherence to every <HI>Punctilio</HI> of our legall Rights, it no way Di∣vests us of our Liberty to defend our selves by Law against all the Enchroachments of our Enemies, nor will it at all weaken that Defence.</P>
<P>Lastly, this will not only disappoint our Enemies, and strengthen our hands, by Engaging the Govern∣ment in our Defence; But it will be the Glory of our Church, and the Honour of our Ministers, as Men of Christianity, as Men of Wisdom, Men of Prudence, and Men of Temper, for ever removing the Re∣proach, which has unjustly been cast upon us, and Convince the World That it has been an Unjust Reproach.</P>
<P>I may add this will Discourage the Expectations of our Forreign Enemies, in their hopes of Introducing the Pretender, Hopes raised upon a Suggestion, that the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> were so Disgusted at those Proceedings, as the Consequences of, and which we are subjected to, by the UNION, That they would readily joyn
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
with any Body, that they might Expect would Dis∣solve it.</P>
<P>But if under all the ill Usage of the Church, by her private Enemies, we appear Zealous for, and sincere in her Majesty's Interest; Calm and Composed in our publick Assemblys, Moderate in our Measures and Re∣solutions, Wise and Prudent in our Councils, and Una∣nimous in Defence of our Queen and Country against a popish <HI>Pretender,</HI> we shall confirm her Majesty in the Belief, that she has not bestowed her Favour and Protection upon an Useless and an Unthankfull people, and our Episcopal Disturbers, like the <HI>Duke of Anjou</HI> at the late Battle in <HI>Spain,</HI> will have gained the Victory, but ha' lost the Day.</P>
