<P>§ I. A Congress had been opened at Niemerow in
Poland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1737.</NOTE> to compromise the differences between
the Czarina and the Grand-Signor: but this proving in∣effectual,
the Emperor declared war against the Turks,
and demanded assistance from the diet of the empire. He
concerted the operations of the campaign with the Empress
of Muscovy. It was agreed, that the Imperialists, under
Count Seckendorf, should attack Widin in Servia, while
the Russians, commanded by Count de Munich, should
penetrate to the Ukraine, and besiege Oezakow, on the
Boristhenes. They accordingly advanced against this
place, which was garrisoned by twenty thousand men;
and on the side of the Boristhenes defended by eighteen
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
gallies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VI. 1737.</NOTE> The Muscovites carried on their approaches
with such impetuosity and perseverance, that the Turks
were terrified at their valour, and in a few days capitulated.
Among those who signalised themselves by uncommon
marks of prowess in these attacks, was General Keith,
now field-marshal in the Prussian service, who was dan∣gerously
wounded on this occasion. Mean while Count
Seckendorf, finding it impossible to reduce Widin without
a squadron of ships on the Danube, turned his arms against
Nissa, which was surrendered to him on the eight-and-twentieth
day of July: but this was the farthest verge of
his good fortune. The Turks attacked the posts which
the Imperialists occupied along the Danube. They took
the fort of Padudil, burned the town of Ilas in Walachia,
and plundered the neighbouring villages. The Prince of
Saxe-Hildburghausen, who had invested Bagnalack in
Bosnia, was defeated, and obliged to repass the Saave.
Count Seckendorf was recalled to Vienna; and the com∣mand
of the army devolved upon Count Philippi. Count
Kevenhuller was obliged to retreat from Servia; and
Nissa was retaken by the Mussulmen. The conferences
at Niemerow were broken off; and the Turkish pleni∣potentiaries
returned to Constantinople.</P>
<P>§ II. The kingdom of Poland now enjoyed the most
perfect repose under the dominion of Augustus. Ferdi∣nand,
the old Duke of Courland, dying without issue,
the succession was disputed by the Teutonick order and
the kingdom of Poland, while the states of Courland
claimed a right of election, and sent deputies to Peter∣sburgh,
imploring the protection of the Czarina. A body
of Russian troops immediately entered that country: and
the states elected the Count de Biron, high chamberlain to
the Empress of Muscovy. The elector of Cologn, as
grand-master of the Teutonick-order, protested against
this election; but the King of Poland agreed to it, on
certain conditions settled at Dantzick with the com∣missaries
of the new Duke and those of the Czarina. In
the month of July, John Gaston de Medicis, Great Duke
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
of Tuscany, died at Florence; and the Prince de Craon
took possession of his territories, in the name of the Duke
of Lorraine, to whom the Emperor had already granted
the eventual investiture of that duchy.</P>
<P>§ III. In England the attention of the publick was at∣tracted
by an open breach in the royal family. The Prin∣cess
of Wales had advanced to the very last month of her
pregnancy before the King and Queen were informed of
her being with child. She was twice conveyed from
Hampton-court to the palace of St. James's, when her
labour pains were supposed to be approaching; and at
length was delivered of a princess in about two hours after
her arrival. The King being apprised of this event, sent
a message by the Earl of Essex to the Prince, expressing
his displeasure at the conduct of his royal highness, as an
indignity offered to himself and the Queen. The Prince
deprecated his Majesty's anger in several submissive letters,
and implored the Queen's mediation. The Princess
joined her entreaties to those of his royal highness: but all
their humility and supplication proved ineffectual. The
King, in another message sent by the Duke of Grafton,
observed, that the Prince had removed the Princess twice
in the week immediately preceding the day of her delivery
from the place of his Majesty's residence, in expectation
of her labour; and both times, on his return, industriously
concealed from the knowledge of the King and Queen
every circumstance relating to this important affair: that
at last, without giving any notice to their Majesties, he
had precipitately hurried the Princess from Hampton-court
in a condition not to be named: that the whole te∣nour
of his conduct, for a considerable time, had been so
entirely void of all real duty to the King, that his Majesty
had reason to be highly offended with him. He gave him
to understand, that until he should withdraw his regard
and confidence from those by whose instigation and advice
he was directed and encouraged in his unwarrantable be∣haviour
to his Majesty and the Queen, and return to his
duty, he should not reside in the palace; he, therefore,
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
signified his pleasure that he should leave St. James's,
with all his family, when it could be done without pre∣judice
or inconvenience to the Princess. In obedience to
this order, the Prince retired to Kew, and made other
efforts to be readmitted into his Majesty's favour, which,
however, he could not retrieve. Whatever might have
been his design in concealing so long from the King and
Queen the pregnancy of the Princess, and afterwards hur∣rying
her from place to place in such a condition, to the
manifest hazard of her life, his Majesty had certainly
cause to be offended at this part of his conduct: though
the punishment seems to have been severe, if not rigorous;
for he was not even admitted into the presence of the
Queen his mother, to express his duty to her, in her last
moments, to implore her forgiveness, and receive her last
blessing. She died of a mortification in her bowels, on
the twentieth day of November, in the fifty-fifth year of
her age, regretted as a princess of uncommon sagacity,
and as a pattern of conjugal virtue.</P>
<P>§ IV. The King opened the session of parliament on
the twenty-fourth day of January, with a short speech,
recommending the dispatch of the publick business with
prudence and unanimity. Each House presented a warm
address of condolance on the Queen's death, with which
he seemed to be extremely affected. Though the House
of Commons unanimously sympathised with the King in
his affliction, the minister still met with contradiction in
some of his favourite measures. One would imagine that
all the arguments for and against a standing army in time
of peace had been already exhausted; but, when it was
moved that the same number of land-forces which they had
voted in the preceding year should be continued in pay
for the ensuing year, the dispute was renewed with sur∣prising
vivacity, and produced some reasons which had not
been suggested before. The adherents of the minister
fairly owned that if the army should be disbanded, or even
considerably reduced, they believed the Tory interest would
prevail; that the present number of forces was absolutely
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
necessary to maintain the peace of the kingdom, which
was filled with clamour and discontent, as well as to sup∣port
the Whig interest; and that they would vote for
keeping up four times the number, should it be found ex∣pedient
for that purpose. The members in the opposition
replied, that this declaration was a severe satire on the
ministry, whose conduct had given birth to such a spirit of
discontent. They said it was in effect a tacit acknow∣ledgement,
that what they called the Whig interest was no
more than an inconsiderable party, which had engrossed the
administration by indirect methods; which acted contrary
to the sense of the nation; and depended for support upon a
military power, by which the people in general were over∣awed,
and consequently enslaved. They affirmed, that
the discontent of which the ministry complained was in
a great measure owing to that very standing army, which
perpetuated their taxes, and hung over their heads, as the
instruments of arbitrary power and oppression. Lord
Polworth explained the nature of Whig principles, and
demonstrated that the party which distinguished itself
by this appellation no longer retained the maxims by
which the Whigs were originally characterised. Sir John
Hynde Cotton, who spoke with the courage and freedom
of an old English baron, declared he never knew a member
of that House who acted on true Whig principles vote for a
standing army in time of peace. “I have heard of Whigs
(said he) who opposed all unlimited votes of credit: I
have heard of Whigs who looked upon corruption as the
greatest curse that could befall any nation: I have
heard of Whigs who esteemed the liberty of the press
to be the most valuable privilege of a free people,
and triennial parliaments as the greatest bulwark of
their liberties; and I have heard of a Whig administra∣tion
which has resented injuries done to the trade of the
nation, and revenged insults offered to the British
flag.”—The ministry triumphed as usual, and the
same number of forces was continued.</P>
<P>§ V. Ever since the treaty of Seville, the Spaniards in
America had almost incessantly insulted and distressed the
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
commerce of Great-Britain. They disputed the right of
English traders to cut logwood in the bay of Campeachy,
and gather salt on the island of Tortugas; though that
right was acknowledged by implication in all the treaties
which had been lately concluded between the two nations.
The captains of their armed vessels, known by the name
of guarda-costas, had made a practice of boarding and plun∣dering
British ships, on pretence of searching for contra∣band
commodities, on which occasions they had be∣haved
with the utmost insolence, cruelty, and rapine.
Some of their ships of war had actually attacked a fleet of
English merchant-ship at the island of Tortugas, as if
they had been at open enmity with England. They had
seised and detained a great number of British vessels, impri∣soned
their crews and confiscated their cargoes in violation
of treaties, in defiance of common justice and humanity.
Repeated memorials were presented to the court of Spain,
by the British ambassador at Madrid. He was amused
with evasive answers, vague promises of enquiry, and ce∣dulas
of instructions sent to the Spanish governors in
America, to which they paid no sort of regard. Not but
that the Spaniards had reason to complain, in their turn,
of the illicit commerce which the English traders from
Jamaica and other islands carried on with their subjects
on the continent of South-America; though this could
not justify the depredations and cruelties which the com∣manders
of the guarda-costas had committed, without
provocation or pretence.</P>
<P>§ VI. The merchants of England loudly complained
of these outrages: the nation was fired with resentment,
and cried for vengeance; but the minister appeared cold,
phlegmatick, and timorous. He knew that a war would
involve him in such difficulties as must of necessity en∣danger
his administration. The treasure which he now
employed for domestick purposes must in that case be
expended in military armaments: the wheels of that ma∣chine
on which he had raised his influence would no
longer move: the opposition would of consequence gain
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
ground, and the imposition of fresh taxes, necessary for
the maintenance of the war, would fill up the measure
of popular resentment against his person and ministry.
Moved by these considerations, he industriously endeavour∣ed
to avoid a rupture, and to obtain some sort of satisfaction
by dint of memorials and negociations, in which he be∣trayed
his own fears to such a degree as animated the Spa∣niards
to persist in their depredations, and encouraged the
court of Madrid to disregard the remonstrances of the Bri∣tish
ambassador. But his apprehensions of war did not pro∣ceed
from Spain only: the two branches of the housee of
Bourbon were now united by politicks, as well as by consan∣guinity;
and he did not doubt, that, in case of a rupture
with Spain, they would join their forces against Great-Bri∣tain.
Petitions were delivered to the House by merchants
from different parts of the kingdom, explaining the re∣peated
violences to which they had been exposed, and im∣ploring
relief of the parliament. These were referred to
a committee of the whole House; and an order was made to
admit the petitioners, if they should think fit to be heard
by themselves or by counsel. Sir John Barnard moved for
an address to the King, that all the memorials and papers
relating to the Spanish depredations should be laid before
the House; and this, with some alteration proposed by
Sir Robert Walpole, was actually presented. In compli∣ance
with the request, an enormous multitude of letters
and memorials was produced.</P>
<P>§ VII. The House, in a grand committee, proceeded
to hear counsel for the merchants, and examine evidence;
by which it appeared that amazing acts of wanton cruelty
and injustice had been perpetrated by Spaniards on the
subjects of Great-Britain. Mr. Pulteney expatiated upon
these circumstances of barbarity. He demonstrated, from
treaties, the right of the British traders to the logwood
of Campeachy, and to the salt of Tortugas: he exposed
the pusillanimity of the minister, and the futility of his
negociations: he moved for such resolutions as would
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>
evince the resentment of an injured nation, and the
vigour of a British parliament. These were warmly
combated by Sir Robert Walpole, who affirmed they
would cramp the ministers in their endeavours to com∣promise
these differences: that they would frustrate their
negociations, entrench upon the King's prerogative, and
precipitate the nation into an unnecessary and expensive
war. Answers produced replies, and a general debate
ensued. A resolution was reported; but the question be∣ing
put for recommitting it, was carried in the negative.
The House, however, agreed to an address, beseeching
his Majesty to use his endeavours to obtain effectual re∣lief
for his injured subjects, to convince the court of
Spain that his Majesty could no longer suffer such con∣stant
and repeated insults and injuries to be carried on, to
the dishonour of his crown, and to the ruin of his trading
subjects; and assuring him, that in case his royal and
friendly instances with the Catholick King, should mis∣carry,
the Hous would effectually support his Majesty in
taking such measures as honour and justice should make it
necessary for him to pursue. To this address the King
made a favourable answer.</P>
<P>§ VIII. The next important subject on which both sides
exercised their talents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1738.</NOTE> was a bill prepared and brought in
by Mr. Pulteney, for the more effectual securing the
trade of his Majesty's subjects in America. This was no
other than the revival of part of two acts passed in the
reign of Queen Anne, by which the property of all prizes
taken from the enemy was vested in the captors: while the
sovereign was empowered to grant commissions or charters
to any persons or societies, for taking any ships, goods,
harbours, lands, or fortifications of the nation's enemies
in America, and for holding and enjoying the same as
their own property and estate for ever. The ministry
endeavoured to evade the discussion of this bill, by amu∣sing
the House with other business, until an end should be
put to the session. A mean artifice was practised with
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
this view;<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1738.</NOTE> and some severe altercation passed between Sir
Robert Walpole and Mr. Pulteney. At length the bill
was read, and gave rise to a very long and warm contest,
in which the greatest orators of both sides found oppor∣tunities
to display their eloquence and satire. Mr.
Pulteney defended the bill with all the ardour of paternal
affection; but, notwithstanding his warmest endeavours,
it was rejected upon a division.</P>
<P>§ IX. When the mutiny-bill was sent up to the House
of Lords, a long debate arose upon the number of troops
voted for the ensuing year. Lord Carteret explained the
situation of affairs in almost every nation of Europe, with
great conciseness and precision. He demonstrated the im∣probability
of a rupture between Great Britain and any
power against which a land-army could be of any service.
He examined the domestick circumstances of the nation;
and proved, that whatever discontents there might be in
the kingdom, there was little or no disaffection, and no
seeming design to overturn or disturb the government. In
answer to an argument, that such a number of regular
forces was necessary for preventing or quelling tumults,
and for enabling the civil magistrate to execute the laws
of his country, he expressed his hope that he should never
see the nation reduced to such unfortunate circumstances:
he said a law which the civil power was unable to execute
must either be in itself oppressive, or such a one as afforded
a handle for oppression. In arguing for a reduction of the
forces, he took notice of the great increase of the national
expense. He observed, that before the Revolution, the
people of England did not raise above two millions for the
whole of the publick charge; but now what was called
the current expense, for which the parliament annually
provided, exceeded that sum, besides the civil list, the in∣terest
due to the publick creditors, and the sinking-fund,
which added together, composed a burthen of six millions
yearly. The Earl of Chesterfield, on the same subject,
affirmed that slavery and arbitrary power were the certain
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>
consequences of keeping up a standing army for any num∣ber
of years.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VI. 1738.</NOTE> It is the machine by which the chains of
slavery are rivetted upon a free people. They may be
secretly prepared by corruption; but, unless a standing
army protected those that forged them, the people would
break them asunder, and chop off the polluted hands by
which they were prepared. By degrees a free people must
be accustomed to be governed by an army: by degrees
that army must be made strong enough to hold them in
subjection. England had for many years been accustom∣ed
to a standing army, under pretence of its being ne∣cessary
to assist the civil power; and by degrees the num∣ber
and strength of it have been increasing. At the ac∣cession
of the late King it did not exceed six thousand: it
soon amounted to double that number, which has been
since augmented under various pretences. He, therefore,
concluded, that slavery, under the disguise of an army for
protecting the liberties of the people, was creeping in
upon them by degrees: if no reduction should be made,
he declared he should expect in a few years to hear some
minister, or favourite of a minister, terrifying the House
with imaginary plots and invasions, and making the tour
of Europe in search of possible dangers, to show the ne∣cessity
of keeping up a mercenary standing army three
times as numerous as the present. In spite of these sug∣gestions,
the standing army maintained its ground. The
same noblemen, assisted by Lord Bathurst, distinguished
themselves in a debate upon the Spanish depredations,
which comprehended the same arguments that were used
in the House of Commons. They met with the same
success in both. Resolutions equivalent to those of the
Lower House were taken: an address was presented;
and his Majesty assured them he would repeat, in the
most pressing manner, his instances at the court of Spain,
in order to obtain satisfaction and security for his subjects
trading to America. This assurance was renewed in his
speech at the close of the session, on the twentieth of May,
when the parliament was prorogued.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="16"/>
§ X. At this period the Princess of Wales was delivered
of a son, who was baptised by the name of George, now
King of Great-Britain. His birth was celebrated with
uncommon rejoicings: addresses of congratulation were
presented to the King by the two universities, and by
almost all the cities and communities of the kingdom.
But the Prince of Wales still laboured under the displea∣sure
of his Majesty, who had ordered the Lord-Chamber∣lain
to signify in the Gazette, that no person who visited
the Prince should be admitted to the court of St. James's.
His royal highness was divested of all the external marks
of royalty, and lived like a private gentleman, cultivating
the virtues of a social life, and enjoying the best fruits of
conjugal felicity. In the latter end of this month, Rear-Admiral
Haddock set sail with a strong squadron for the
Mediterranean, which it was hoped would give weight to
the negociation of the British minister at the court of Ma∣drid.
The act to discourage the retail of spirituous liquors
had incensed the populace to such a degree as occasioned
numberless tumults in the cities of London and Westmin∣ster.
They were so addicted to the use of that pernicious
compound known by the appellation of gin or geneva,
that they ran all risques rather than forego it entirely;
and so little regard was paid to the law by which it was
prohibited, that in less than two years twelve thousand
persons within the bills of mortality were convicted of
having sold it illegally. Nearly one half of that number
were cast in the penalty of one hundred pounds: and three
thousand persons paid ten pounds each, for an exemp∣tion
from the disgrace of being committed to the house of
correction.</P>
<P>§ XI. The war maintained by the Emperor and the
Czarina against the Ottoman Porte had not yet produced
any decisive event. Count Seckendorf was disgraced and
confined, on account of the ill success of the last campaign.
General Doxat was tried by a council of war at Belgrade,
and condemned to death, for having surrendered to the
enemy the town of Nissa, in which he commanded
<PB N="13" REF="17"/>
The diet of the empire granted a subsidy of fifty Roman
months to the Emperor, who began to make vigorous
preparations for the ensuing campaign: but, in the mean
time, Ragotski, vaivode of Transylvania, revolted against
the house of Austria, and brought a considerable army
into the field, under the protection of the Grand-Signor.
He was immediately proclaimed a rebel, and a price set
upon his head by the court of Vienna. The Turks taking
the field early, reduced the fort of Usitza, and Meadia,
and undertook the siege of Orsova, which, however,
they abandoned at the approach of the Imperial army,
commanded by the Grand Duke of Tuscany, assisted by
Count Konigsegg. The Turks being re-enforced,
marched back, and attacked the Imperialists, by whom
they were repulsed after an obstinate engagement. The
Germans, notwithstanding this advantage, repassed the
Danube; and then the infidels made themselves masters of
Orsova, where they found a fine train of artillery, designed
for the siege of Widin. By the conquest of this place,
the Turks laid the Danube open to their gallies and
vessels; and the Germans retired under the cannon of Bel∣grade.
In the Ukraine, the Russians under General
Count Munich obtained the advantage over the Turks in
two engagements; and General Lacy routed the Tartars
of the Crimea: but they returned in greater numbers, and
harrassed the Muscovites in such a manner, by intercepting
their provisions, and destroying the country, that they
were obliged to abandon the lines of Precops.</P>
<P>§ XII. In the month of October, an affair of very
small importance produced a rupture between the King
of Denmark and the Elector of Hanover. A detachment
of Hanoverians took by assault the castle of Steinhorst, be∣longing
to the Privy-counsellor Wederkop, and defended
by thirty Danish dragoons, who had received orders to
repel force by force. Several men were killed on both
sides, before the Hanoverians could enter the place, when
the garrison was disarmed, and conducted to the frontiers.
This petty dispute, about a small territory which did not
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>
yield the value of one thousand pounds a year, had well
nigh involved Hanover in a war, which, in all probability,
Great-Britain must have maintained: but this dispute
was compromised by a convention between the Kings of
England and Denmark.</P>
<P>§ XIII. The session of parliament was opened on the
first day of February, when the King, in his speech to
both Houses, gave them to understand, that a convention
was concluded and ratified between him and the King of
Spain, who had obliged himself to make reparation to the
British subjects for their losses, by certain stipulated pay∣ments:
the plenipotentiaries were named and appointed
for regulating, within a limited time, all those grievances
and abuses which had hitherto interrupted the commerce
of Great-Britain in the American seas; and for settling
all matters in dispute, in such a manner as might for the
future prevent and remove all new causes and pretenses of
complaint. The motion for an address of approbation
was disputed as usual. Though the convention was not
yet laid before the House, the nature of it was well known
to the leaders of the opposition. Sir William Wyndham
observed, that if the ministry had made the resolutions
taken by the parliament in the last session the foundation
of their demands; if they had discovered a resolution to
break off all treating, rather than depart from the sense
of parliament, either a defensive treaty might have been
obtained, or by this time the worst would have been
known: but, by what appeared from his Majesty's speech,
the convention was no other than a preliminary; and,
in all probability, a very bad preliminary. He sup∣posed
the minister had ventured to clothe some of his
creatures with full powers to give up the rights of the
nation; for they might do it if they durst. Sir Robert
Walpole, in answer to these suggestions, affirmed, that
the ministry had on this occasion obtained more than ever
on like occasions was known to be obtained; that they
had reconciled the peace of their country with her true
interest: that this peace was attended with all the advan∣tages
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>
that the most successful arms could have procured:
that future ages would consider this as the most glorious
period of our history, and do justice to the councils that
produced the happy event, which every gentleman divested
of passion and prejudice was ready to do; and which, he
believed, the present age, when rightly informed, would
not refuse. In a word, he extolled his own convention
with the most extravagant encomiums.</P>
<P>§ XIV. The House resolved to address the King, that
copies of all the memorials, representations, letters, and
papers, presented to his Majesty, or his secretary of state,
relating to depredations, should be submitted to the pe∣rusal
of the House: but some members in the opposition
were not contented with this resolution. Then Mr.
Sandys, who may be termed “the motion-maker,”
moved for an address, desiring that the House might in∣spect
all letters written, and instructions given by the se∣cretaries
of state, or commissioners of the Admiralty, to
any of the British governors in America, or any comman∣der
in chief, or captains of his Majesty's ships of war, or
his Majesty's minister at the court of Spain, or any of his
Majesty's consuls in Europe, since the treaty of Seville,
relating to losses which the British subjects had sustained
by means of depredations committed by the subjects of
Spain in Europe and America. This was an unreasonable
proposal, suggested by the spirit of animosity and faction.
Mr. H. Walpole justly observed, that a compliance with
such an address might lay open the most private trans∣actions
of the cabinet, and discover secrets that ought,
for the good of the kingdom, to be concealed. It would
discover to the court of Spain the <HI>ultimatum</HI> of the King's
demands and concessions, and the nation would thereby
be deprived of many advantages which it might reap,
were no such discovery made. He said, that as soon as
the differences betwixt the two courts should arrive at such
a crisis, and not before, the consuls were instructed to
give notice to the merchants, that they might retire in
time with their effects; but, should such instruction come
<PB N="16" REF="20"/>
to the knowledge of the Spaniards, it would be a kind of
watch-word to put them on their guard, and unavoidably
occasion the ruin of many thousands of British subjects.
Certain it is, no government could act either in external
or domestick affairs with proper influence, dignity, and
dispatch, if every letter and instruction relating to an
unfinished negociation should be exposed to the view of
such a numerous assembly, composed of individuals actu∣ated
by motives in themselves diametrically opposite. The
motion being rejected by the majority, the same gentle∣man
moved again for an address, that his Majesty would
give directions for laying before the House copies of such
memorials or representations as had been made, either to
the King of Spain or to his ministers, since the treaty of
Seville, relating to the depredations committed in Europe
or America. A debate ensued; and, upon a division, the
question passed in the negative.</P>
<P>§ XV. The House, in a committee of supply, voted
twelve thousand seamen for the service of the ensuing year,
and the standing army was continued without reduction,
though powerfully attacked by the whole strength of the
opposition. The Commons likewise ordered an address
to his Majesty, for the copies of several memorials since
the treaty of Seville, touching the rights of Great-Britain,
or any infraction of treaties which had not been laid before
them. These were accordingly submitted to the inspection
of the House. By this time the convention itself was not
only presented to the Commons, but also published for
the information of the people. Divers merchants, plant∣ers,
and others trading to America, the cities of London
and Bristol, the merchants of Liverpool, and the owners
of sundry ships which had been seised by the Spaniards,
offered petitions against the convention, by which the
subjects of Spain were so far from giving up their ground∣less
and unjustifiable practice of visiting and searching
British ships sailing to and from the British plantations,
that they appeared to have claimed the power of doing i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
as a right: for they insisted that the differences which
<PB N="17" REF="21"/>
had arisen concerning it should be referred to plenipo∣tentiaries,
to be discussed by them, without even agreeing
to abstain from such visitation and search during the time
that the discussion of this affair might last. They, there∣fore,
prayed that they might have an opportunity of being
heard, and allowed to represent the great importance of
the British trade to and from the plantations in America;
the clear indisputable right which they had to enjoy it,
without being stopped, visited, or searched, by the Spa∣niards,
on any pretence whatsoever; and the certain in∣evitable
destruction of all the riches and strength derived
to Great-Britain from that trade, if a search of British
ships sailing to and from their own plantations should be
tolerated upon any pretext, or under any restictions, or
even if the freedom of this navigation should continue
much longer in a state of uncertainty. These petitions
were referred to the committee appointed to consider of
the convention. Another remonstrance was likewise pre∣sented
by the trustees for establishing the colony of Georgia,
setting forth, that the King of Spain claimed that colony
as part of his territories; and that by the conventions the
regulation of the limits of Carolina and Florida was re∣ferred
to the determination of plenipotentiaries; so that
the colony of Georgia, which undoubtedly belonged to
the crown of Great-Britain, was left in dispute, while the
settlers remained in the most precarious and dangerous
situation. It was moved that the merchants should be
heard by their counsel: but the proposal was strenuously
opposed by the ministry, and rejected upon a division.</P>
<P>§ XVI. This famous convention, concluded at the
Pardo on the fourteenth day of January, imported, That
within six weeks, to be reckoned from the day on which
the ratifications were exchanged, two ministers pleni∣potentiaries
should meet at Madrid, to con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er and finally
regulate the respective pretensions of the two crowns, with
relation to the trade and navigation in America and Eu∣rope,
and to the limits of Florida and Carolina, as well as
concerning other points which remained likewise to be
<PB N="18" REF="22"/>
adjusted, according to the former treaties subsisting be∣tween
the two nations: That the plenipotentiaries should
finish their conferences within the space of eight months:
That in the mean time no progress should be made in the
fortifications of Florida and Carolina: That his Catho∣lick
Majesty should pay to the King of Great-Britain the
sum of ninety-five thousand pounds, for a balance due to
the crown and subjects of Great-Britain, after deduction
made of the demands of the crown and subjects of Spain:
That this sum should be employed for the satisfaction, dis∣charge
and payment of the demands of the British subjects
upon the crown of Spain: That this reciprocal discharge,
however, should not extend or relate to the accounts and
differences which subsisted and were to be settled between
the crown of Spain and the assiento company, nor to any
particular or private contracts that might subsist between
either of the two crowns, or their ministers, with the sub∣jects
of the other; or between the subjects and subjects of
each nation respectively: That his Catholick Majesty
should cause the sum of ninety-five thousand pounds to be
paid at London within four months, to be reckoned from
the day on which the ratifications were exchanged. Such
was the substance of that convention, which alarmed and
provoked the merchants and traders of Great Britain,
excited the indignation of all those who retained any
regard for the honour of their country, and raised a ge∣neral
cry against the minister who stood at the helm of
administration.</P>
<P>§ XVII. The eyes of the whole kingdom were now
turned upon the House of Commons. The two contend∣ing
parties summoned their whole force for the approach∣ing
dispute: on the day appointed for considering the
convention, four hundred members had taken their seats
by eight in the morning. In a committee of the whole
House, certain West-India merchants and planters were
heard against the convention: so that this and the follow∣ing
day were employed in reading papers and obtaining in∣formation.
On the eighth day of March Mr. H. Walpole
<PB N="19" REF="23"/>
having launched out in the praise of that agreement, moved
for an address of approbation to his Majesty. He was second∣ed
by Mr. Campbell, of Pembrokeshire; and the debate
began with extraordinary ardour. He who first distin∣guished
himself in the lists was Sir Thomas Sanderson,
at that time treasurer to the Prince of Wales, afterwards
Earl of Scarborough. All the officers and adherents of
his royal highness had joined the opposition; and he him∣self
on this occasion sat in the gallery, to hear the debate
on such an important transaction. Sir Thomas Sander∣son
observed, that the Spaniards by the convention, instead
of giving us reparation, had obliged us to give them a ge∣neral
release. They had not allowed the word Satisfaction
to be so much as once mentioned in the treaty. Even
the Spanish pirate who had cut off the ear of Captain Jen∣kins
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Captain Jenkins was master of a Scottish merchant ship. He was board∣ed by the captain of a Spanish guarda-costa, who treated him in the most barbarous manner. The Spaniards, after having rummaged his vessel for what they called contraband commodities, without finding any thing to justify their search, insulted Jenkins with the most opprobrious invectives. They tore off one of his ears, bidding him carry it to his King, and tell him they would serve him in the same manner should an opportunity offer: they tortured him with the most shocking cruelty, and threatened him with immediate death. This man was examined at the bar of the House of Com∣mons, and being asked by a member, what he thought when he sound him∣self in the hands of such barbarians? “I recommended my soul to God (said he) and my cause to my country.” The behaviour of this brave seaman, the sight of his ear, which was produced, with his account of the indignities which had been offered to the nation and sovereign of Great-Britain, filled the whole House with indignation. Jenkins was afterwards employed in the service of the East-India company: he approved himself worthy of his good fortune, in a long engagement with the pirate Angria, during which he be∣haved with extraordinary courage and conduct; and saved his ownship, with three others that were under his convoy.</NOTE>, and used the most insulting expression towards the
person of the King—an expreion which no British sub∣ject
could decently repeat—an expression an expression which no man
that had a regard for his sovereign could ever forgive—even
this fellow lived to enjoy the fruits of his rapine, and re∣mained
a living testimony of the cowardly tameness and
mean submission of Great-Britain; of the triumphant
<PB N="20" REF="24"/>
haughtiness, and stubborn pride of Spain. Lord Gage,
one of the most keen, spirited, and sarcastick orators in
the House, stated in this manner the account of the satis∣faction
obtained from the court of Spain by the conven∣tion:
the losses sustained by the Spanish depredations
amounted to three hundred and forty thousand pounds.
The commissary, by a stroke of his pen, reduced this de∣mand
to two hundred thousand pounds; then forty-five
thousand were struck off for prompt payment. He next
allotted sixty thousand pounds as the remaining part of a
debt pretended to be due to Spain, for the destruction of
her fleet by Sir George Byng, though it appeared by the
instructions on the table, that Spain had been already
amply satisfied on that head. These deductions reduced
the balance to ninety-five thousand pounds, but the King
of Spain insisted upon the South-Sea company's paying
immediately the sum of sixty-eight thousand pounds, as a
debt due to him on one head of accounts, though, in other
articles, his Catholick Majesty was indebted to the com∣pany
a million over and above this demand. The re∣mainder
to be paid by Spain did not exceed seven-and-twenty
thousand pounds, from which she insisted upon
deducting whatever she might have already given in satis∣faction
for any of the British ships that had been taken;
and on being allowed the value of the St. Theresa, a
Spanish ship which had been seised in the port of Dublin.
Mr. W. Pitt, with an energy of argument and diction
peculiar to himself, declaimed against the convention, as
insecure, unsatisfactory, and dishonourable to Great-Britain.
He said the great national objection, the search∣ing
of British ships, was not omitted, indeed, in the pre∣amble;
but stood there as the reproach of the whole, as
the strongest evidence of the fatal submission that followed:
on the part of Spain, an usurpation, an inhuman tyranny
claimed and exercised over the American seas: on the part
of England, an undoubted right by treaties, and from
God and nature declared and asserted in the resolutions of
parliament, were now referred to the discussion of ple∣nipotentiaries,
<PB N="21" REF="25"/>
upon one and the same equal foot. This
undoubted right was to be discussed and regulated; and if
to regulate be to prescribe rules, as in all constructions it is,
that right was, by the express words of the convention,
to be given up and sacrificed: for it must cease to be any
thing from the moment it is submitted to limitation. Mr.
Lyttelton, with equal force and fluency, answered the
speech of Mr. H. Walpole. “After he had used many
arguments to persuade us to peace (said he) to any
peace, good or bad, by pointing out the dangers of a
war, dangers I by no means allow to be such as he re∣presents
them, he crowned all those terrors with the
name of the Pretender. It would be the cause of the
Pretender. The Pretender would come. Is the ho∣nourable
gentleman sensible what this language im∣ports?
The people of England complain of the greatest
wrongs and indignities: they complain of the inter∣ruption,
the destruction of their trade: they think the
peace has left them in a worse condition than before;
and in answer to all these complaints, what are they told?
Why, that their continuing to suffer all this, is the
price they must pay to keep the King and his family on
the throne of these realms. If this were true, it ought
not to be owned; but it is far from truth; the very
reverse is true. Nothing can weaken the family; no∣thing
shake the establishment, but such measures as
these, and such language as this.” He affirmed, that
if the ministers had proceeded conformably to the inten∣tions
of parliament, they would either have acted with
vigour, or have obtained a real security in an express ac∣knowledgment
of our right not to be searched, as a pre∣liminary,
<HI>sine qua non,</HI> to our treating at all. Instead of
this, they had referred it to plenipotentiaries. “Would
you, Sir (said he) submit to a reference, whether you
may travel unmolested from your house in town to your
house in the country? Your right is clear and un∣deniable,
why would you have it discussed; but much
less would you refer it, if two of your judges belonged
<PB N="22" REF="26"/>
to a gang which has often stopped and robbed you i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
your way thither before.”—The ministers, in vindi∣cation
of the convention, asserted, that the satisfaction
granted by Spain was adequate to the injury received: that
it was only the preliminary of a treaty which would remove
all causes of complaint: that war was always expensive
and detrimental to a trading nation, as well as uncertain
in its events: that France and Spain would certainly join
their forces in case of a rupture with Great-Britain: that
there was not one power in Europe upon which the En∣glish
could depend for effectual assistance; and that war
would favour the cause and designs of a popish pretender.
The House, upon a division, agreed to the address; but
when a motion was made for its being recommitted, the
two parties renewed the engagement with redoubled
eagerness and impetuosity. Sir William Wyndham and
Mr. Pulteney poured all the thunder of their eloquence
against the insolence of Spain, and the concessions of the
British ministry. Sir Robert Walpole exerted all his for∣titude
and dexterity in defence of himself and his measures,
and the question being put, the resolutions for the address
were carried by a small majority.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. Then Sir William Wyndham standing up∣made
a pathetick remonstrance upon this determination.
“This address (said he) is intended to convince man∣kind,
that the treaty under our consideration is a rea∣sonable
and an honourable treaty. But if a majority of
twenty-eight in such a full House should fail of that
success; if the people should not implicitly resign their
reason to a vote of this House, what will be the conse∣quence?
Will not the parliament lose its authority?
Will it not be thought, that even in the parliament we
are governed by a faction? and what the consequence
of this may be, I leave to those gentlemen to consider,
who are now to give their vote for this address: for my
own part, I will trouble you no more; but, with these
my last words, I sincerely pray to Almighty God, who
has so often wonderfully protected these kingdoms, that
he will graciously continue his protection over them, by
<PB N="23" REF="27"/>
preserving us from that impending danger which threat∣ens
the nation from without, and likewise from that
impending danger which threatens our constitution
from within.” The minister was on this occasion
deserted by his usual temper, and even provoked into
personal abuse. He declared, that the gentleman who
was now the mouth of his opponents had been look∣ed
upon as the head of those traitors, who twenty-five
years before conspired the destruction of their country
and of the royal family, in order to set a popish pretender
upon the throne: that he was seised by the vigilance
of the then government, and pardoned by its clemency;
but all the use he had ungratefully made of that clemency,
was to qualify himself according to law, that he and his
party might some time or other have an opportunity to
overthrow all law. He branded them all as traitors, and
expressed his hope, that their behaviour would unite all
the true friends of the present happy establishment. To
such a degree of mutual animosity were both sides inflamed,
that the most eminent members of the minority actually
retired from parliament; and were by the nation in gene∣ral
revered as martyrs to the liberty of the people.</P>
<P>§ XIX. The dispute occasioned by the convention in the
House of Lords was maintained with equal warmth, and
perhaps with more abilities. After this famous treaty had
been considered, Lord Carteret suggested, that possibly one
of the contracting powers had presented a protest or de∣claration,
importing that she acceded to such or such a
measure, only upon condition that the terms of that pro∣test
or declaration should be made good. He said, that
until his mind should be free from the most distant sus∣picion
that such a paper might exist in the present case,
he could not form a just opinion of the transaction himself,
nor communicate to their lordships any light which might
be necessary for that purpose. The adherents to the ministry
endeavoured to evade his curiosity in this particular, by
general assertions: but he insisted on his suspicion with
such perseverance, that at length the ministry produced
the copy of a declaration made by the King of Spain before
<PB N="24" REF="28"/>
he ratified the convention, signifying that his Catholick
Majesty reserved to himself, in its full force, the right of
being able to suspend the assiento of negroes, in case the
company should not pay within a short time the sum of
sixty-eight thousand pounds sterling, owing to Spain on
the duty of negroes, or on the profit of the ship Caroline:
That under the validity and force of this protest, the
signing of the said convention might be proceeded on,
and in no other manner. In the debate that ensued, Lord
Carteret displayed a surprising extent of political know∣ledge,
recommended by all the graces of elocution, chaste,
pure, dignified, and delicate. Lord Bathurst argued against
the articles of convention with his usual spirit, integrity,
and good sense, particularly animated by an honest indig∣nation,
which the wrongs of his country had inspired.
The Earl of Chesterfield attacked this inglorious measure
with all the weight of argument, and all the poignancy of
satire. The Duke of Argyle, no longer a partisan of the
ministry, inveighed against it as infamous, treacherous,
and destructive, with all the fire, impetuosity, and en∣thusiasm
of declamation. It was defended with unequal
arms by the Duke of Newcastle, the Earl of Cholmond∣ley,
Lord Hervey, the Lord Chancellor, the Bishop of
Salisbury, and in particular by the Earl of Ilay, a noble∣man
of extensive capacity and uncommon erudition; re∣markable
for his knowledge of the civil law; and seem∣ingly
formed by nature for a politician; cool, discerning,
plausible, artful, and enterprising; staunch to the mini∣ster,
and invariably true to his own interest. The dispute
was learned, long, and obstinate: but ended as usual in
the discomfiture of those who had stigmatised the treaty.
The House agreed to an address, in which they
thanked his Majesty for his gracious condescension in lay∣ing
before them the convention. They acknowledged his
great prudence in bringing the demands of his subjects
for their past losses, which had been so long depending,
to a final adjustment; in procuring an express stipulation
for a speedy payment; and in laying a foundation for ac∣complishing
<PB N="25" REF="29"/>
the great and desirable ends of obtaining
future security, and preserving the peace between the two
nations. They declared their confidence in his royal
wisdom, that in the treaty to be concluded in pursuance of
the convention, proper provisions would be made for the
redress of the grievances of which the nation had so justly
complained: They assured his Majesty, that in case his
just expectations should not be answered, the House would
heartily and zealously concur in all such measures as should
be necessary to vindicate his Majesty's honour, and to pre∣serve
to his subjects the full enjoyment of all those rights
to which they were entitled by treaty and the law of na∣tions.
This was a hard-won victory. At the head of
those who voted against the address we find the Prince of
Wales. His example was followed by six dukes, two-and
twenty earls, four viscounts, eighteen barons, four bishops,
and their party was re-enforced by sixteen proxies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1739.</NOTE> A spi∣rited
protest was entered and subscribed by nine-and-thirty
peers, comprehending all the noblemen of the kingdom
who were most eminent for their talents, integrity, and
virtue.</P>
<P>§ XX. A message having been delivered to the House
from his Majesty, importing, That he had settled nine-and-thirty
thousand pounds per annum on the younger
children of the royal family; and desiring thier lordships
would bring in a bill to enable his Majesty to make that pro∣vision
good, out of the hereditary revenues of the crown,
some lords in the opposition observed that the next heir to
the crown might look upon this settlement as a mortgage
of his revenue, which a parliament had no power to
make: that formerly no daughter of the royal family was
ever provided for by parliament, except the eldest, and
that never was by way of annuity, but an express provi∣sion
of a determinate sum of money paid by way of
dowry. These objections were over-ruled; and the House
complied with his Majesty's request. Then the Duke of
Newcastle produced a subsidy-treaty, by which his Majesty
obliged himself to pay to the King of Denmark seventy
<PB N="26" REF="30"/>
thousand pounds per annum,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1739.</NOTE> on condition of the Danes
furnishing to his Britannick Majesty a body of six thousand
men, when demanded. At the same time, his grace deli∣vered
a message from the King, desiring the House would
enable him to fulfil this engagement; and also to raise
what money and troops the exigency of affairs, during
the approaching recess, might require. Another vehe∣ment
dispute arose from this proposal. With respect
to the treaty, Lord Carteret observed, that no use could
be made of the Danish troops in any expedition under∣taken
against Spain, because it was stipulated in the treaty,
that they should not be used either in Italy, or on board
of the fleet, or be transported in whole or in part beyond
sea, after they should have marched out of the territories
of Denmark, except for the defence of the kingdoms of
Great-Britain and Ireland: nay, should France join
against the English, the Danes could not act against that
power or Spain, except as part of an army formed in
Germany or Flanders. This body of Danes may be said,
therefore, to have been retained for the defence and pro∣tection
of Hanover: or, if the interest of Britain was at
all consulted in the treaty, it must have been in prevent∣ing
the Danes from joining their fleets to those of France
and Spain. Then he argued against the second part of
the message with great vivacity. He said nothing could
be more dangerous to the constitution than a general and
unlimited vote of credit. Such a demand our ancestors
would have heard with amazement, and rejected with
scorn. He affirmed that the practice was but of modern
da<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in England: that it was never heard of before the
Revolution; and never became frequent until the nation
was blessed with the present wise administration. He
said, if ever a general vote of credit and confidence
should become a customary compliment from the parlia∣ment
to the crown at the end of every session, or as often
as the minister might think fit to desire it, parliaments
would grow despicable in the eyes of the people: then a
proclamation might be easily substituted in its stead, and
<PB N="27" REF="31"/>
happy would it be for the nation if that should be suffi∣cient;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VI. 1739.</NOTE>
for when a parliament ceases to be a check upon
ministers, it becomes an useless and unnecessary burthen
on the people. The representatives must always be paid
some way or other: if their wages are not paid openly
and surely by their respective constituents, as they were
formerly, a majority of them may in future times be al∣ways
ready to accept of wages from the administration,
and these must come out of the pockets of the people.
The Duke of Argyle and the Earl of Chesterfield enlarg∣ed
upon the same topicks. Nevertheless, the House com∣plied
with the message; and presented an address, in which
they not only approved of the treaty with Denmark, but
likewise assured his Majesty they would concur with his
measures, and support him in fulfilling his engagements, as
well as in making such further augmentation of his forces
by sea and land, as he should think necessary for the ho∣nour,
interest, and safety of these kingdoms.</P>
<P>§ XXI. The same message being communicated to the
Commons, they voted seventy thousand five hundred and
eighty three pounds, for the subsidy to Denmark, and
five hundred thousand pounds for augmenting the forces
on any emergency. As Great-Britain stood engaged by
the convention to pay the crown of Spain the sum of
sixty thousand pounds in consideration of the ships taken
and destroyed by Sir George Byng, which sum was to be
applied to the relief of the British merchants who had
suffered by the Spanish depredations, the Commons insert∣ed
in a bill a clause, providing for this sum to be paid
by the parliament. When the bill was read in the
House of Lords a motion was made by Lord Bathurst
for an address, to know, whether Spain had paid the
money stipulated by the convention, as the time limited
for the payment of it was now expired? The Duke of New∣castle,
by his Majesty's permission, acquainted the House,
that it was not paid; and that Spain had as yet given
no reason for the non-payment. Then a day was appoint∣ed
to consider the state of the nation, when Lord Carteret
<PB N="28" REF="32"/>
moved for a resolution, that the failure of Spain in this
particular was a breach of the convention, a high indig∣nity
to his Majesty, and an injustice to the nation: but
after a warm debate, this motion was over-ruled by the
majority. The minister, in order to atone in some mea∣sure
for the unpopular step he had taken in the conven∣tion▪
allowed a salutary law to pass for the encouragement
of the woollen manufacture; and two bills in behalf of
the sugar colonies, one permitting them, for a limited time,
to export their produce directly to foreign parts, under
proper restrictions; and the other making more effectual
provisions for securing the duties laid upon the importa∣tion
of foreign sugars, rum, and melasses into Great-Britain,
and his Majesty's plantations in America. The supplies
being voted, the funds established, and the crown grati∣fied
in every particular, the King closed the session with
a speech on the fourteenth day of June, when the Chan∣cellor
in his Majesty's name prorogued the parliament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Among the laws enacted in the course of this session was an act against gaming, which had become universal through all ranks of people, and likely to prove destructive of all morals, industry, and sentiment. Ano∣ther bill passed, for granting a reward to Joanna Stevens, on her disco∣vering, for the benefit of the publick, a nostrum for the cure of persons afflicted with the stone; a medicine which has by no means answered the expectations of the legislature.</P>
<P>In the House of Lords complaint was made by Lord Delawar, of a sa∣tire, intituled Manners, written by Mr. Whitehead; in which some cha∣racters of distinction were severely lashed, in the true spirit of poetry. It was voted a libel; a motion was made to take the author into custody: but he having withdrawn himself, the resentment of the House fell upon R. Dodsley, the publisher of the work, who was committed to the usher of the black-rod, though Lord Carteret, the Earl of Abingdon, and Lord Talbot, spoke in his behalf.</P>.</NOTE></P>
<P>§ XXII. Letters of marque and reprisal were granted
against the Spaniards: a promotion was made of general
officers: the troops were augmented: a great fleet was
assembled at Spithead; a re-enforcement set out to
Admiral Haddock; and an embargo laid on all merchant
ships outward bound. Notwithstanding these prepara∣tions
of war, Mr. Keen, the British minister at Madrid,
declared to the court of Spain, that his master, although
he had permitted his subjects to make reprisals, would
<PB N="29" REF="33"/>
not be understood to have broken the peace; and that
this permission would be recalled as soon as his Catholick
Majesty should be disposed to make the satisfaction which
had been so justly demanded. He was given to under∣stand,
that the King of Spain looked upon those reprisals
as acts of hostility; and that he hoped, with the assistance
of heaven and his allies, he should be able to support a
good cause against his adversaries. He published a ma∣nifesto
in justification of his own conduct, complaining
that Admiral Haddock had received orders to cruise with
his squadron between the capes St. Vincent and St. Mary,
in order to surprise the assogue ships; that letters of re∣prisal
had been published at London, in an indecent style,
and even carried into execution in different parts of the
world. He excused his non-payment of the ninety-five
thousand pounds stipulated in the convention, by affirm∣ing
that the British court had first contravened the arti∣cles
of that treaty, by the orders sent to Haddock; by
continuing to fortify Georgia; by re-enforcing the squa∣dron
at Jamaica; and by eluding the payment of the
sixty-eight thousand pounds due to Spain from the South-Sea
company, on the assiento for negroes. The French
ambassador at the Hague, declared that the King his
master was obliged by treaties to assist his Catholick
Majesty by sea and land, in case he should be attacked;
he dissuaded the States-General from espousing the quar∣rel
of Great-Britain; and they assured him they would
observe a strict neutrality, though they could not avoid
furnishing his Britannick-Majesty with such succours
as he could demand, by virtue of the treaties subsisting
between the two powers. The people of England were
inspired with uncommon alacrity at the near prospect of
war, for which they had so long clamoured; and the
ministry seeing it unavoidable, began to be earnest and
effectual in their preparations.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. The events of war were still unfavourable
to the Emperor. He had bestowed the command of his
army upon Velt mareschal Count Wallis, who assembled
<PB N="30" REF="34"/>
his forces in the neighbourhood of Belgrade, and advanc∣ed
towards Crotska, where he was attacked by the Turks
with such impetuosity and perseverance, that he was
obliged to give ground, after a long and obstinate engage∣ment,
in which he lost above six thousand men. The Earl
of Crawford, who served as a volunteer in the Imperial
army, signalized his courage in an extraordinary manner
on this occasion, and received a dangerous wound, of
which he never perfectly recovered. The Turks were
afterwards worsted at Jabouka: nevertheless, their grand
army invested Belgrade on the side of Servia, and carried
on the operations of the siege with extraordinary vigour.
The Emperor, dreading the loss of this place, seeing his
finances exhausted, and his army considerably diminished,
consented to a negociation for peace, which was trans∣acted
under the mediation of the French ambassador at the
Ottoman Porte. The Count de Neuperg, as Imperial
plenipotentiary, signed the preliminaries on the first day of
September. They were ratified by the Emperor, though
he pretended to be dissatisfied with the articles; and de∣clared
that his minister had exceeded his powers. By
this treaty the house of Austria ceded to the Grand
Signor Belgrade, Sabatz, Servia, Austrian Walachia, the
isle and fortress of Orsova, with the fort of St. Elizabeth;
and the contracting powers agreed that the Danube and
the Saave should serve as boundaries to the two empires.
The Emperor published a circular letter, addressed to his
ministers at all the courts in Europe, blaming Count
Wallis for the bad success of the last campaign, and dis∣owning
the negociations of Count Neuperg: nay, these
two officers were actually disgraced, and confined in
different castles. This, however, was no other than a
sacrifice to the resentment of the Czarina, who loudly
complained, that the Emperor had concluded a separate
peace, contrary to his engagements with the Russian
empire. Her general, Count Munich, had obtained a
victory over the Turks at Choczim in Moldavia, and
made himself master of that place, in which he found two
<PB N="31" REF="35"/>
hundred pieces of artillery: but the country was so
ruined by the incursions of the Tartars, that the Mus∣covites
could not subsist in it during the winter. The
Czarina finding herself abandoned by the Emperor, and
unable to cope with the whole power of the Ottoman
empire, took the first opportunity of putting an end to
the war upon honourable terms. After a short negocia∣tion,
the conferences ended in a treaty, by which she
was left in possession of Asoph, on condition that its for∣tifications
should be demolished; and the ancient limits
were re-established between the two empires.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. A rupture between Great-Britain and Spain
was now become inevitable. The English squadron in
the Mediterranean had already made prize of two rich
Caracca ships. The King had issued orders for augment∣ing
his land-forces, and raising a body of marines: and a
great number of ships of war were put in commission.
Admiral Vernon had been sent to the West-Indies, to
assume the command of the squadron in those seas; and
to annoy the trade and settlements of the Spaniards.
This gentleman had rendered himself considerable in the
House of Commons, by loudly condemning all the mea∣sures
of the ministry, and bluntly speaking his sentiments,
whatever they were, without respect of persons, and some∣times
without any regard to decorum. He was counted
a good officer, and this boisterous manner seemed to en∣hance
his character. As he had once commanded a squa∣dron
in Jamaica, he was perfectly well acquainted with
those seas; and in a debate upon the Spanish depredations.
he chanced to assirm, that Porto-Bello on the Spanish main
might be easily taken: nay, he even undertook to reduce
it with six ships only. This offer was echoed from the
mouths of all the members in the opposition. Vernon
was extolled as another Drake or Raleigh: he became the
idol of a party, and his praise resounded from all corners
of the kingdom. The minister, in order to appease the
clamours of the people on this subject, sent him as com∣mander
in chief to the West-Indies. He was pleased with
<PB N="32" REF="36"/>
an opportunity to remove such a troublesome censor from
the House of Commons; and perhaps, he was not without
hope, that Vernon would disgrace himself and his party,
by failling in the exploit he had undertaken. His Catho∣lick
Majesty having ordered all the British ships in his
harbours to be seised and detained, the King of England
would keep measure with him no longer, but denounced
war against him on the twenty-third day of October.
Many English merchants began to equip privateers, and
arm their trading vessels, to protect their own commerce,
as well as to distress that of the enemy. The session of
parliament was opened in November, when the King, in
his speech to both Houses, declared that he had augment∣ed
his forces by sea and land, pursuant to the power vested
in him by parliament for the security of his dominions,
the protection of trade, and the annoyance of the enemy;
and he expressed his apprehension, that the heats and
animosities which had been industriously fomented through∣out
the kingdom encouraged Spain to act in such a man∣ner
as rendered it necessary for him to have recourse to
arms. In answer to this speech, affectionate addresses
were presented by both Houses, without any considerable
opposition.</P>
<P>§ XXV. The seceding members had again resumed
their seats in the House of Commons; and Mr. Pulteney
thought proper to vindicate the extraordinary step which
they had taken. He said, they thought that step was ne∣cessary,
as affairs then stood, for clearing their characters to
posterity from the imputation of sitting in an assembly where
a determined majority gave a sanction to measures evidently
to the disgrace of his Majesty and the nation. He observ∣ed,
that their conduct was so fully justified by the decla∣ration
of war against Spain, that any further vindication
would be superfluous; for every assertion contained in it
had been almost in the same words insisted upon by those
who opposed the convention: “Every sentence in it (added
he) is an echo of what was said in our reasoning;
against that treaty: every positive truth which the
<PB N="33" REF="37"/>
declaration lays down was denied with the utmost con∣fidence
by those who spoke for the convention; and,
since that time, there has not one event happened which
was not then foreseen and foretold.” He proposed,
that in maintaining the war, the Spanish settlements in
the West-Indies should be attacked; and that the ministry
should not have the power to give up the conquests that
might be made. He said he heartily wished, for his
Majesty's honour and service, that no mention had been
made of heats and animosities in the King's speech; and
gave it as his opinion, that they should take no notice
of that clause in their address. He was answered by Sir
Robert Walpole, who took occasion to say, he was in
no great concern lest the service of his Majesty or the
nation should suffer by the absence of those members who
had quitted the House: he affirmed the nation was gene∣rally
sensible, that the many useful and popular acts which
passed towards the end of the last session were greatly for∣warded
and facilitated by the secession of those gentlemen;
and, if they were returned only to oppose and perplex, he
should not be at all sorry to see them secede again.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. Mr. Pulteney revived the bill which he had
formerly prepared for the encouragement of seamen.
After a long dispute and eager opposition by the mini∣stry,
it passed both Houses, and obtained the royal assent.
Mr. Sandys having observed, that there could be no
immediate use for a great number of forces in the king∣dom;
and explained how little service could be expected
from raw and undisciplined men; proposed an address to
the King, desiring that the body of marines should be
composed of drafts from the old regiments: that as few
officers should be appointed as the nature of the case
would permit; and he expressed his hope, that the House
would recommend this method to his Majesty, in tender
compassion to his people, already burthened with many
heavy and grievous taxes. This scheme was repugnant
to the intention of the ministry, whose aim was to in∣crease
the number of their dependents, and extend their
<PB N="34" REF="38"/>
parliamentary interest, by granting a great number of
commissions. The proposal was, therefore, after a long
debate, rejected by the majority. Motions were made for
an enquiry into the conduct of those who concluded the
convention; but they were over-ruled. The pension-bill
was revived, and so powerfully supported by the elo∣quence
of Sir William Wyndham, Mr. Pulteney, and
Mr. Lyttelton, that it made its way through the Commons
to the Upper House, where it was again lost, upon a divi∣sion,
after a very long debate. As the seamen of the
kingdom expressed uncommon aversion to the service of the
government, and the fleet could not be manned without
great difficulty, the ministry prepared a bill, which was
brought in by Sir Charles Wager, for registering all sea∣men,
watermen, fishermen, and lightermen throughout
his Majesty's dominions. Had this bill passed into a law,
a British sailor would have been reduced to the most abject
degree of slavery: had he removed from a certain district
allotted for the place of his residence, he would have been
deemed a deserter, and punished accordingly: he must
have appeared, when summoned, at all hazards, whatever
might have been the circumstances of his family, or the
state of his private affairs: had he been incumbered with
debt, he must either have incurred the penalties of this
law, or lain at the mercy of his creditors: had he acquired
by industry, or received by inheritance, an ample fortune,
he would have been liable to be torn from his possessions,
and subjected to hardships which no man would endure
but from the sense of fear or indigence. The bill was so
vigorously opposed by Sir John Barnard and others, as a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>agrant encroachment on the liberties of the people, that
the House rejected it on the second reading.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. The King having by message communi∣cated
to the House his intention of disposing the Princess
Mary in marriage to Prince Frederick of Hesse; and ex∣pressing
his hope, that the Commons would enable him
to give a suitable portion to his daughter; they unanimous¦ly
resolved to grant forty thousand pounds for that purpose;
<PB N="35" REF="39"/>
and presented an address of thanks to his Majesty, for
having communicated to the House this intended marri∣age.
On the thirteenth day of March a ship arrived from
the West-Indies, dispatched by Admiral Vernon, with an
account of his having taken Porto-Bello, on the isthmus of
Darien, with six ships only, and demolished all the forti∣fications
of the place. The Spaniards acted with such
pusillanimity on this occasion, that their forts were taken
almost without bloodshed. The two Houses of parliament
joined in an address of congratulation upon this success of
his Majesty's arms; and the nation in general was won∣derfully
elated by an exploit which was magnified much
above its merit. The Commons granted every thing the
crown thought proper to demand. They provided for
eight-and-twenty thousand land-forces, besides six thou∣sand
marines. They enabled his Majesty to equip a very
powerful navy: they voted the subsidy to the King of
Denmark; and they empowered their sovereign to defray
certain extraordinary expenses not specified in the esti∣mates.
To answer these uncommon grants, they im∣posed
a land-tax of four shillings in the pound; and enabled
his Majesty to deduct twelve hundred thousand pounds
from the sinking fund: in a word, the expense of the war,
during the course of the ensuing year, amounted to about
four millions. The session was closed on the twenty-ninth
day of April, when the King thanked the Com∣mons
for the supplies they had so liberally granted, and
recommended union and moderation to both Houses.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. During the greatest part of this winter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1740.</NOTE>
the poor had been grievously afflicted in consequence of a
severe frost, which began at Christmas and continued till
the latter end of February. The river Thames was co∣vered
with such a crust of ice, that a multitude of people
dwelled upon it in tents, and a great number of booths
were erected for the entertainment of the populace. The
navigation was entirely stopped: the watermen and fisher∣men
were disabled from earning a livelihood: the fruits of
the earth were destroyed by the cold, which was so extreme,
<PB N="36" REF="40"/>
that many persons were chilled to death;<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK. II. 1740.</NOTE> and this cala∣mity
was the more deeply felt, as the poor could not afford
to supply themselves with coals and fuel, which were ad∣vanced
in price, in proportion to the severity and continu∣ance
of the frost. The lower class of labourers, who
worked in the open air, were now deprived of all means
of subsistence: many kinds of manufacture were laid aside,
because it was found impracticable to carry them on. The
price of all sorts of provision rose almost to a dearth: even
water was sold in the streets of London. In this
season of distress, many wretched families must have pe∣rished
by cold and hunger, had not those of opulent for∣tunes
been inspired with a remarkable spirit of compassion
and humanity. Nothing can more redound to the honour
of the English nation, than did those instances of bene∣volence
and well conducted charity which were then ex∣hibited.
The liberal hand was not only opened to the pro∣fessed
beggar, and the poor that owned their distress: but
uncommon pains were taken to find out and relieve those
more unhappy objects, who from motives of false pride, or
ingenuous shame, endeavoured to conceal their misery.
These were assisted almost in their own despite. The
solitary habitations of the widow, the fatherless, and the
unfortunate were visited by the beneficent, who felt for
the woes of their fellow-creatures; and to such as refuse to
receive a portion of the publick charity, the necessaries of
life were privately conveyed, in such a manner as could
least shock the delicacy of their dispositions.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. In the beginning of May, the King of Great
Britain set out for Hanover, after having appointed a re∣gency,
and concerted vigorous measures for distressing the
enemy. In a few days after his departure, the spousals of
the Princess Mary were celebrated by proxy, the Duke
of Cumberland representing the Prince of Hesse, and in
June the Princess embarked for the continent. About
the same time, a sloop arrived in England with dispatches
from Admiral Vernon, who, since his adventure at Porto-Bello,
had bombarded Carthagena, and taken the sort of
<PB N="37" REF="41"/>
San Lorenzo, on the river of Chagre, in the neighbour∣hood
of his former conquest. This month was likewise
marked by the death of his Prussian Majesty, a prince by
no means remarkable for great or amiable qualities. He
was succeeded on the throne by Frederick his eldest son,
the reigning king of that realm, who has so eminently
distinguished himself as a warrior and legislator. In Au∣gust
the King of Great-Britain concluded a treaty with
the Landgrave of Hesse, who engaged to furnish him with
a body of six thousand men for four years, in conside∣ration
of an annual subsidy of two hundred and fifty thou∣sand
crowns.</P>
<P>§ XXX. Mean while, preparations of war were vigo∣rously
carried on by the ministry in England. They had
wisely resolved to annoy the Spaniards in their American
possessions. Three ships of war cruising in the bay of
Biscay, fell in with a large Spanish ship of the line strong∣ly
manned, and took her after a very obstinate engage∣ment:
but the assogue ships arrived, with the treasure,
in Spain, notwithstanding the vigilance of the English
commanders, who were stationed in a certain latitude to
intercept that flota. One camp was formed on Hounslow
heath; and six thousand marines lately levied were en∣camped
on the isle of Wight, in order to be embarked for
the West-Indies. Intelligence being received that a
strong squadron of Spanish ships of war waited at Ferrol
for orders to sail to their American settlements, Sir John
Norris sailed with a powerful fleet from Spithead, to dis∣pute
their voyage; and the Duke of Cumberland served in
person as a Volunteer in this expedition: but, after divers
fruitless efforts, he was by contrary winds obliged to lie
inactive for the greatest part of the summer in Torbay;
and, upon advice that the French and Spanish squadrons
had sailed to the West-Indies in conjunction, the design
against Ferrol was wholly laid aside. In September, a
small squadron of ships, commanded by Commodore
Anson, set sail for the South-sea, in order to act against
the enemy on the coast of Chili and Peru, and co-operate
<PB N="38" REF="42"/>
occasionally with Admiral Vernon across the isthmus of
Darien. The scheme was well laid, but ruined by un∣necessary
delays, and unforeseen accidents. But the hopes
of the nation centered chiefly in a formidable armament
designed for the northern coast of New Spain, and his
Catholick Majesty's other settlements on that side of the
Atlantick. Commissions had been issued for raising a re∣giment
of four battalions in the English colonies of
North-America, that they might be transported to Ja∣maica,
and join the forces from England. These, con∣sisting
of the marines, and detachments from some old
regiments, were embarked in October at the isle of Wight,
under the command of Lord Cathcart, a nobleman of ap∣proved
honour, and great experience in the art of war;
and they sailed under convoy of Sir Chaloner Ogle, with a
fleet of seven and-twenty ships of the line, besides frigates,
fire-ships, bomb-ketches, and tenders. They were likewise
furnished with hospital-ships, and store-ships, laden with
provision, ammunition, all sorts of warlike implements, and
every kind of convenience. Never was an armament more
completely equipped; and never had the nation more reason
to hope for extraordinary success.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. On the twentieth day of October, Charles VI.
Emperor of Germany, the last prince of the house of
Austria, died at Vienna, and was succeeded in his here∣ditary
dominions by his eldest daughter, the Archduchess
Maria Theresa, married to the Grand Duke of Tuscany.
Though this princess succeeded as Queen o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hungary, by
virtue of the pragmatic sanction guaranteed by all the
powers in Europe, her succession produced such contests
as kindled a cruel war in the empire. The young King
of Prussia was no sooner informed of the Emperor's death,
than he entered Silesia at the head of twenty thousand
men; seised certain fiefs to which his family laid claim:
and published a manifesto, declaring that he had no intention
to contravene the pragmatic sanction. The Elector of
Bavaria refused to acknowledge the Archduchess as Queen
of Hungary and Bohemia, alledging that he himself had
pretensions to those countries, as the descendant of the
<PB N="39" REF="43"/>
Emperor Ferdinand I. who was head of the German
branch of the house of Austria. Charles VI. was sur∣vived
but a few days by his ally, the Czarina Anne I wan∣owna,
who died in the forty-fifth year of her age, after
having bequeathed her crown to Iwan, or John, the in∣fant
son of her niece, the Princess Anne of Mecklenbourg,
who had been married to Anthony Ulrick, Duke of
Brunswick Lunenburg-Bevern. She appointed the Duke
of Courland regent of the empire, and even guardian of
the young Czar, though his own parents were alive: but
this disposition was not long maintained.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. The King of Great-Britain having returned
to England from his German dominions, the session of
parliament was opened in November. His Majesty assured
them, on this occasion, that he was determined to prose∣cute
the war vigorously, even though France should
espouse the cause of Spain, as her late conduct seemed to
favour this supposition. He took notice of the Empe∣ror's
death, as an event which in all likelihood would
open a new scene of affairs in Europe: he, therefore,
recommended to their consideration the necessary sup∣plies
for putting the nation in such a posture that it should
have nothing to fear from any emergency. Finally, he
desired them to consider of some proper regulations for
preventing the exportation of corn, and for more effec∣tual
methods to man the fleet at this conjuncture. The
Commons, after having voted an address of thanks,
brought in a bill for prohibiting the exportation of corn
and provisions, for a limited time, out of Great-Britain,
Ireland, and the American plantations. This was a
measure calculated to distress the enemy, who were sup∣posed
to be in want of these necessaries. The French
had contracted for a very large quantity of beef and pork
in Ireland, for the use of their own and of the Spanish
navy; and an embargo had been laid upon the ships of
that kingdom. This bill met with a vigorous opposition:
yet the House unanimously resolved, that his Majesty
should be addressed to lay an immediate embargo upon all
<PB N="40" REF="44"/>
ships laden with corn, grain, starch, rice, beef, pork,
and other provisions, to be exported to foreign parts.
They likewise resolved that the thanks of the House should
be given to Vice-Admiral Vernon, for the services he had
done to his king and country in the West-Indies. One
William Cooley was examined at the bar of the House,
and committed to prison, after having owned himself au∣thor
of a paper intituled, “Considerations upon the
embargo on provision of victual.” The performance
contained many shrewd and severe animadversions upon
the government, for having taken a step which, without
answering the purpose of distressing the enemy, would
prove a grievous discouragement to trade, and ruin all the
graziers of Ireland. Notwithstanding the arguments used
in this remonstrance, and several petitions that were pre∣sented
against the corn-bill, it passed by mere dint of mi∣nisterial
influence. The other party endeavoured, by va∣rious
motions, to set on foot an enquiry into the orders,
letters, and instructions which had been sent to Admi∣ral
Vernon and Admiral Haddock: but all such investiga∣tions
were carefully avoided.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. A very hot contest arose from a bill which
the ministry brought in under the specious title of, A bill
for the encouragement and increase of seamen, and for
the better and speedier manning his Majesty's fleet.
This was a revival of the oppressive scheme which had
been rejected in the former session; a sheme by which
the justices of the peace were empowered to issue war∣rants
to constables and headboroughs, to search by day
or night for such sea-faring men as should conceal them∣selves
within their respective jurisdictions. Those search∣ers
were vested with authority to force open doors, in
case of resistance; and encouraged to this violence by a
reward for every seaman they should discover; while the
unhappy wretches so discovered were dragged into the
service, and their names entered in a register to be kept at
the Navy or the Admiralty-office. Such a plan of ty∣ranny
did not pass uncensured. Every exceptionable
<PB N="41" REF="45"/>
clause produced a warm debate, in which Sir John Bar∣nard,
Mr. Pulteney, Mr. Sandys, Lord Gage, Mr. Pitt,
and Mr. Lyttelton, signalized themselves nobly in de∣fending
the liberties of their fellow subjects. Mr. Pitt
having expressed a laudable indignation at such a large
stride towards despotick power, in justification of which
nothing could be urged but the plea of necessity, Mr. H.
Walpole thought proper to attack him with some personal
sarcasms. He reflected upon his youth; and observed
that the discovery of truth was very little promoted by
pompous diction and theatrical emotion. These insinua∣tions
exposed him to a severe reply. Mr. Pitt standing
up again, said, “He would not undertake to determine
whether youth could be justly imputed to any man as
a reproach: but he affirmed, that the wretch, who
after having seen the consequence of repeated errors,
continues still to blunder, and whose age has only
added obstinacy to stupidity, is surely the object of
either abhorrence or contempt, and deserves not that
his grey head should secure him from insults: much
more is he to be abhorred, who, as he has advanced
in age, has receded from virtue, and becomes more
wicked with less temptation; who prostitutes himself
for money which he cannot enjoy; and spends the
remains of his life in the ruin of his country.”—Peti∣tions
were presented from the city of London, and coun∣ty
of Gloucester, against the bill, as detrimental to the
trade and navigation of the kingdom, by discouraging
rather than encouraging sailors, and destructive to the
liberties of the subject: but they were both rejected, as
insults upon the House of Commons. After very long
debates, maintained on both sides with extraordinary
ardour and emotion, the severe clauses were dropped, and
the bill passed with amendments.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. But the most remarkable incident of this
session was an open and personal attack upon the mini∣ster,
who was become extremely unpopular all over the
kingdom. The people were now more than ever sensible
<PB N="42" REF="46"/>
of the grievous taxes under which they groaned; and saw
their burthens daily increasing. No effectual attempt
had as yet been made to annoy the enemy. Expensive
squadrons had been equipped; had made excursions,
and returned without striking a blow. The Spanish fleet
had sailed first from Cadiz, and then from Ferrol, with∣out
any interuption from Admiral Haddock, who com∣manded
the British squadron in the Mediterranean, and
who was supposed to be restricted by the instructions he
had received from the ministry, though in fact his want
of success was owing to accident. Admiral Vernon had
written from the West-Indies to his private friends, that
he was neglected, and in danger of being sacrificed.
Notwithstanding the numerous navy which the nation
maintained, the Spanish privateers made prize of the Bri∣tish
merchant ships with impunity. In violation of trea∣ties,
and in contempt of that intimate connexion which
had been so long cultivated between the French and
English ministry, the King of France had ordered the
harbour and fortifications of Dunkirk to be repaired: his
fleet had sailed to the West-Indies, in conjunction with that
of Spain; and the merchants of England began to tremble
for Jamaica: finally, commerce was in a manner suspend∣ed,
by the practice of pressing sailors into the service, and
by the embargo which had been laid upon ships in all the
ports of Great Britain and Ireland. These causes of po∣pular
discontent, added to other complaints which had
been so long repeated against the minister, exaggerated
and inculcated by his enemies with unwearied industry,
at length rendered him so universally odious, that his
name was seldom or never mentioned with decency, ex∣cept
by his own dependents.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. The country-party in parliament seised this
opportunity of vengeance. Mr. Sandys went up to Sir
Robert Walpole in the House, and told him, that on Fri∣day
next he should bring a charge against him in publick.
The minister seemed to be surprised at this unexpected
intimation; but, after a short pause, thanked him politely
<PB N="43" REF="47"/>
for this previous notice, and said he desired no favour,
but fair play<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Upon this occasion he misquoted Horace. “As I am not conscions of any crime (said he) I do not doubt of being able to make a proper defence. <HI>Nil conscire sibi nulli pallescere culpae.</HI>” He was corrected by Mr. Pulteney; “ but insisted upon his being in the right, and actually laid a wager on the justness of his quotation.”</NOTE>. Mr. Sandys, at the time which he had
appointed for this accusation, stood up, and in a studied
speech entered into a long deduction of the minister's
misconduct. He insisted upon the discontents of the na∣tion,
in consequence of the measures which had been for
many years pursued at home and abroad. He professed
his belief that there was not a gentleman in the House
who did not know that one single person in the admini∣stration
was the chief, if not the sole adviser and promo∣ter
of all those measures. “This (added he) is known
without doors, as well as within; therefore, the discon∣tents,
the reproaches, and even the curses of the people
are all directed against that single person. They com∣plain
of present measures: they have suffered by past
measures: they expect no redress; they expect no
alteration or amendment, whilst he has a share in di∣recting
or advising our future administration. These,
Sir, are the sentiments of the people in regard to that
minister: these sentiments we are in honour and duty
bound to represent to his Majesty; and the proper me∣thod
for doing this, as established by our constitution,
is to address his Majesty to remove him from his
councils.” He then proceeded to explain the particulars
of the minister's misconduct in the whole series of his ne∣gociations
abroad. He charged him with having endea∣voured
to support his own interest, and to erect a kind of
despotick government, by the practice of corruption; with
having betrayed the interest and honour of Great-Britain
in the late convention; with having neglected to prosecute
the war against Spain; and he concluded with a motion
for an address to the King, that he would be pleased to re∣move
Sir Robert Walpole from his presence and councils
for ever. He was answered by Mr. Pelham, who under∣took
<PB N="44" REF="48"/>
to defend or excuse all the measures which the oth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
had condemned; and aquitted himself as a warm frier<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and unshaken adherent. Against this champion Sir Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

out and exposed all the material errors and mal-practic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of the administration. Sir Robert Walpole spoke wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

this charge; but when it was so generally laid, he did n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

by the court members till three o'clock in t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

<P>§ XXXVI. A bill was brought in for prohibiting <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

and Mr. Willimot, who demonstrated that this kind<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
traffick was advantageous to the kingdom; and the sche<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
was dropped. Another warm contest arose upon a clau<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

The Commons voted forty thousand seamen for the service
of the ensuing year, and about thirty thousand men for
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he establishment of land-forces. They provided for the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bsidies granted to the King of Denmark and the Land∣grave
of Hesse-Cassel; and took every step which was sug∣gested
for the ease and convenience of the government.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. The parties in the House of Lords were
influenced by the same motives which actuated the Com∣mons.
The Duke of Argyle, who had by this time resign∣ed
all his places, declared open war against the ministry.
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the beginning of the session, the King's speech was no
sooner reported by the Chancellor, than this nobleman
stood up, and moved that a general address of thanks
should be presented to his Majesty, instead of a recapitula∣tion
of every paragraph of the King's speech, re-echoed
from the parliament to the throne, with expressions of blind
approbation, implying a general concurrence with all the
measures of the minister. He spoke on this subject with
an astonishing impetuosity of eloquence, that rolled like a
river which had overflowed its banks and deluged the whole
adjacent country. The motion was supported by Lord
Bathurst, Lord Carteret, the Earl of Chesterfield, and
Lord Gower, who, though they displayed all the talents
of oratory, were out-voted by the opposite party, headed
by the Duke of Newcastle, the Earl of Cholmondeley,
Lord Hervey, and the Lord Chancellor. The motion
was rejected, and the address composed in the usual strain.
The same motions for an enquiry into orders and instruc∣tions,
which had miscarried in the Lower House, were
here repeated with the same bad success: in the debates
which ensued, the young Earls of Hallifax and Sandwich
acquired a considerable share of reputation, for the strength
of argument and elocution with which they contended
against the adherents of the ministry. When the House
took into consideration the state of the army, the Duke of
Argyle having harangued with equal skill and energy on
<PB N="46" REF="50"/>
military affairs, proposed that the forces should be augment∣ed
by adding new levies to the old companies, without in∣creasing
the number of officers; as such an augmentation
served only to debase the dignity of the service, by raising
the lowest of mankind to the rank of gentlemen; and to
extend the influence of the minister, by multiplying his de∣pendents.
He, therefore, moved for a resolution, that the
augmenting the army by raising regiments, as it is the most
unnecessary and most expensive method of augmentation,
was also the most dangerous to the liberties of the nation.
This proposal was likewise over-ruled, after a short though
warm contention. This was the fate of all the other moti∣ons
made by the lords in the opposition, though the victory
of the courtiers was always clogged with a nervous and spirit∣ed
protest. Two days were expended in the debate produ∣ced
by Lord Carteret's motion for an address, beseeching his
Majesty to remove Sir Robert Walpole from his presence
and councils for ever. The speech that ushered in this
memorable motion would not have disgraced a Cicero. It
contained a retrospect of all the publick measures which
had been pursued since the Revolution. It explained the
nature of every treaty, whether right or wrong, which had
been concluded under the present administration. It de∣scribed
the political connections subsisting between the dif∣ferent
powers in Europe. It exposed the weakness, the
misconduct, and the iniquity of the minister, both in his
foreign and domestick transactions. It was embellished
with all the ornaments of rhetorick, and warmed with a
noble spirit of patriot indignation. The Duke of Argyle,
Lord Bathurst, and his other colleagues, seemed to be ani∣mated
with uncommon servour, and even inspired, by the
subject.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1741.</NOTE> A man of imagination, in reading their speeches,
will think himself transported into the Roman senate, be∣fore
the ruin of that republick. Nevertheless, the minister
still triumphed by dint of numbers; though his victory
was dearly purchased. Thirty peers entered a vigorous
protest; and Walpole's character sustained such a rude
shock from this opposition, that his authority seemed to be
<PB N="47" REF="51"/>
drawing near a period. Immediately after this contest was
decided, the Duke of Marlborough moved for a resolution,
that any attempt to inflict any kind of punishment on any
person, without allowing him an opportunity to make his
defence, or without any proof of any crime or misdemea∣nour
committed by him, is contrary to natural justice, the
fundamental laws of the realm, and the ancient established
usage of parliament; and is a high infringement of the li∣berties
of the subject. It was seconded by the Duke of
Devonshire and Lord Lovel; and opposed by Lord Gower,
as an intended censure on the proceedings of the day.
This sentiment was so warmly espoused by Lord Talbot,
who had distinguished himself in the former debate, that he
seemed to be transported beyond the bounds of moderation.
He was interrupted by the Earl of Cholomondeley, who
charged him with having violated the order and decorum
which ought to be preserved in such an assembly. His
passion was inflamed by this rebuke: he declared himself
an independent lord; a character which he would not for∣feit
for the smiles of a court, the profit of an employ∣ment,
or the reward of a pension: he said when he was
engaged on the side of truth, he would trample on the
insolence that should command him to suppress his sen∣timents.
—On a division, however, the motion was car∣ried.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. In the beginning of April, the King
repairing to the House of Peers, passed some acts that
were ready for the royal assent. Then, in his speech to
both Houses, he gave them to understand, that the Queen
of Hungary had made requisition of the twelve thousand
men stipulated by treaty; and that he had ordered the
subsidy-troops of Denmark and Hesse-Cassel to be in rea∣diness
to march to her assistance. He observed, that in
this complicated and uncertain state of affairs, many in∣cidents
might arise, and render it necessary for him to
incur extraordinary expenses for maintaining the pragma∣tick-sanction,
at a time when he could not possibly have
<PB N="48" REF="52"/>
recourse to the advice and assistance of his parliament.
He, therefore, demanded of the Commons such a supply
as might be requisite for these ends; and promised to ma∣nage
it with all possible frugality. The Lower House
in their address, approved of all his measures; declared
they would effectually support him against all insults and
attacks that might be made upon any of his territories
though not belonging to the crown of Great-Britain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and that they would enable him to contribute, in the
most effectual manner, to the support of the Queen o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Hungary. Sir Robert Walpole moved, that an aid o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
two hundred thousand pounds should be granted to that
princess. Mr. Shippen protested against any interposi∣tion
in the affairs of Germany. He expressed his dislike
of the promise which had been made to defend his Ma∣jesty's
foreign dominions; a promise, in his opinion, in∣consistent
with that important and inviolable law, the
act of settlement; a promise which, could it have been
foreknown, would perhaps have for ever precluded from
the succession that illustrious family to which the nation
owed such numberless blessings, such continued felicity
The motion however passed, though not without further
opposition; and the House resolved, that three hundred
thousand pounds should be granted to his Majesty, to
enable him effectually to support the Queen of Hungary.
Towards the expense of this year, a million was deducted
from the sinking fund; and the land tas continued at
four shillings in the pound. The preparations for this
war had already cost five millions. The session was closed
on the twenty-fifth day of April, when the King took
his leave of this parliament, with warm expressions of
tenderness and satisfaction. Henry Bromley, Stephen
Fox, and John Howe, three members of the Lower
House, who had signalized themselves in defence of the
minister, were now ennobled, and created barons of
Montford, Ilchester, and Chedworth. A camp was
formed near Colchester; and the King having appoint∣ed
<PB N="49" REF="53"/>
a regency, set out in May for his German domi∣nions<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sir William Wyndham died in the preceding year, deeply regretted as an orator, a patriot, and a man, the constant assertor of British liberty, and one of the chief ornaments of the English nation. In the course of
the same year, General Oglethorpe, governor of Georgia, had, with some
succours obtained from the colony of Carolina, and a small squadron of the King's ships, made an attempt upon fort Augustine, the capital of Spanish Florida; and actually reduced some small sorts in the neighbour∣hood of the place: but the Carolinians withdrawing in disgust, dissenti∣ons prevailing among the sea officers, the hurricane months approaching, and the enemy, having received a supply and re-enforcement, he abandon∣ed the enterprise, and returned to Georgia.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>§ I. THE British armament had by this time pro∣ceeded
to action in the West-Indies. Sir
Chaloner Ogle, who sailed from Spithead, had been over∣taken
by a tempest in the bay of Biscay, by which the
fleet, consisting of about one hundred and seventy sail,
were scatterd and dispersed. Nevertheless, he prosecuted
his voyage, and anchored with a view to provide wood
and water, in the neutral island of Dominica, where the
intended expedition sustained a terrible shock in the death
of the gallant Lord Cathcart, who was carried off by a
dysentery. The loss of this nobleman was the more se∣verely
felt, as the command of the land-forces devolved
upon General Wentworth, an officer without experience,
authority, and resolution. As the fleet sailed along the
island of Hispaniola, in its way to Jamaica, four large
ships of war were discovered; and Sir Chaloner detached
an equal number of his squadron to give them chase,
while he himself proceeded on his voyage. As those
strange ships refused to bring to, Lord Augustus Fitzroy,
the commodore of the four British ships, saluted one of
them with a broadside, and a smart engagement ensued.
After they had fought during the best part of the night, the
<PB N="52" REF="56"/>
enemy hoisted their colours in the morning, and appeared
to be part of the French squadron, which had sailed from
Europe under the command of the Marquis d'Antin, with
orders to assist the Spanish admiral, De Torres, in at∣tacking
and distressing the English ships and colonies.
War was not yet declared between France and England;
therefore hostilities ceased: the English and French com∣manders
complimented each other; excused themselves
mutually, for the mistake which had happened; and part∣ed
as friends, with a considerable loss of men on both
sides.</P>
<P>§ II. In the mean time Sir Chaloner Ogle arrived at
Jamaica, where he joined Vice-Admiral Vernon, who now
found himself at the head of the most formidable fleet and
army that ever visited those seas, with full power to act at
discretion. The conjoined squadrons consisted of nine-and-twenty
ships of the line, with almost an equal number
of frigates, fireships, and bomb-ketches, well manned, and
plentifully supplied with all kinds of provisions, stores, and
necessaries. The number of seamen amounted to fifteen
thousand: that of the land-forces, including the American
regiment of four battalions, and a body of negroes inlisted
at Jamaica, did not fall short of twelve thousand. Had
this armament been ready to act in the proper season of the
year, under the conduct of wise, experienced officers, united
in councils, and steadily attached to the interest and honour
of their country, the Havannah, and whole island of Cuba,
might have been easily reduced: the whole treasure of the
Spanish West-Indies would have been intercepted; and
Spain must have been humbled into the most abject sub∣mission.
But several unfavourable circumstances concurred
to frustrate the hopes of the publick. The ministry had
detained Sir Chaloner Ogle at Spithead, without any visible
cause, until the season for action was almost exhausted:
for, on the continent of New Spain, the periodical rains
begin about the end of April; and this change in the at∣mosphere
is always attended with epidemical distempers,
which render the climate extremely unhealthy: besides,
<PB N="53" REF="57"/>
the rain is so excessive, that for the space of two months
no army can keep the field.</P>
<P>§ III. Sir Chaloner Ogle arrived at Jamaica on the
ninth day of January; and Admiral Vernon did not sail
on his intended expedition till towards the end of the
month. Instead of directing his course to the Havannah,
which lay to leeward, and might have been reached in
less than three days, he resolved to beat up against the
wind to Hispaniola, in order to observe the motion of the
French squadron, commanded by the Marquis d'Antin.
The fifteenth day of February had elapsed before he re∣ceived
certain information that the French admiral had
sailed for Europe in great distress, for want of men and
provisions, which he could not procure in the West-Indies.
Admiral Vernon, thus disappointed, called a council of
war, in which it was determined to proceed for Cartha∣gena.
The fleet being supplied with wood and water
at Hispaniola, set sail for the continent of New-Spain, and
on the fourth of March anchored in Playa Grande, to the
windward of Carthagena. Admiral de Torres had already
sailed to the Havannah: but Carthagena was strongly for∣tified,
and the garrison re-enforced by the crews of a
small squadron of large ships, commanded by Don Blas
de Leso, an officer of experience and reputation. Here
the English Admiral lay inactive till the ninth, when the
troops were landed on the island of Tierra Bomba, near
the mouth of the harbour, known by the name of Boca∣chica,
or Little-mouth, which was surprisingly fortified
with castles, batteries, booms, chains, cables, and ships
of war. The British forces erected a battery on shore,
with which they made a breach in the principal fort, while
the Admiral sent in a number of ships to divide the fire of
the enemy, and co-operative with the endeavours of the
army. Lord Aubrey Beauclerc, a gallant officer, who
commanded one of these ships, was slain on this occasion,
The breach being deemed practicable, the forces advance∣ed
to the attack: but the forts and batteries were abandon∣ed:
the Spanish ships that lay athwart the harbour's mouth
<PB N="54" REF="58"/>
were destroyed or taken: the passage was opened, and the
fleet entered without further opposition. Then the forces
were re-embarked with the artillery, and landed within a
mile of Carthagena, where they were opposed by about
seven hundred Spaniards, whom they obliged to retire.
The admiral and general had contracted a hearty contempt
for each other, and took all opportunities of expressing
their mutual dislike: far from acting vigorously in concert,
for the advantage of the community, they maintained a
mutual reserve, and separate cabals; and each proved more
eager for the disgrace of his rival, than zealous for the
honour of the nation.</P>
<P>§ IV. The general complained that the fleet lay
idle, while his troops lay harrassed and dimiuished
by hard duty and distemper. The admiral affirmed
that his ships could not lie near enough to batter
the town of Carthagena: he upbraided the general with
inactivity and want of resolution to attack the fort of St.
Lazar, which commanded the town, and might be taken
by scalade. Wentworth, stimulated by these reproaches,
resolved to try the experiment. His forces marched up
to the attack: but the guides being slain, they mistook
their route, and advanced to the strongest part of the for∣tification,
where they were moreover exposed to the fire
of the town. Colonel Grant, who commanded the gre∣nadiers,
was mortally wounded: the scaling-ladders were
sound too short: the officers were perplexed for want of
orders and directions: yet the soldiers sustained a severe
fire for several hours with surprising intrepidity, and at
length retreated, leaving about six hundred killed or
wounded on the spot. Their number was now so much
reduced, that they could no longer maintain their footing
on shore: besides, the rainy season had begun with such
violence, as rendered it impossible for them to live in
camp. They were, therefore, re-embarked: and all hope
of further success immediately vanished. The admiral,
however, in order to demonstrate the impracticability of
taking the place by sea, sent in the Gallicia, one of the
<PB N="55" REF="59"/>
Spanish ships which had been taken at Boca-chica, to can∣nonade
the town, with sixteen guns mounted on one side,
like a floating battery. This vessel, manned by detach∣ments
of volunteers from different ships, and commanded
by Captain Hore, was warped into the inner harbour, and
moored before day, at a considerable distance from the
walls, in very shallow water. In this position she stood
the fire of several batteries for some hours, without doing
or sustaining much damage: then the admiral ordered the
men to be brought off in boats, and the cables to be cut;
so that she drove with the sea-breeze upon a shoal, where
she was soon filled with water. The exploit was absurd,
and the inference which the admiral drew from it altoge∣ther
fallacious. He said it plainly proved, that there was
not depth of water in the inner harbour, sufficient to admit
large ships near enough to batter the town, with any pro∣spect
of success. This, indeed, was the case in that part of
the harbour to which the Gallicia was conducted: but a lit∣tle
farther to the left, he might have stationed four or five
of his largest ships a-breast, within pistol-shot of the walls;
and if this step had been taken, when the land forces
marched to the attack of St. Lazar, in all probability the
town would have been surrendered.</P>
<P>§ V. After the re-embarkation of the troops, the distem∣pers
peculiar to the climate and season began to rage with
redoubled fury; and great numbers of those who escaped
the vengeance of the enemy perished by a more painful
and inglorious fate. Nothing was heard but complaints
and execrations: the groans of the dying, and the service
for the dead: nothing was seen but objects of woe, and
images of dejection. The conductors of this unfortunate
expedition agreed in nothing but the expediency of a speedy
retreat from this scene of misery and disgrace. The for∣tifications
of the harbour were demolished, and the flect
returned to Jamaica. The miscarriage of this expedition,
which had cost the nation an immense sum of money, was
no sooner known in England, than the kingdom was filled
with murmurs and discontent, and the people were
<PB N="56" REF="60"/>
depressed, in proportion to that sanguine hope by which
they had been elevated. Adm. Vernon, instead of under∣taking
any enterprise which might have retrieved the ho∣nour
of the British arms, set sail from Jamaica with the
forces in July, and anchored at the south-east part of Cuba,
in a bay, on which he bestowed the appellation of Cum∣berland
harbour. The troops were landed, and encamped
at the distance of twenty miles farther up the river,
where they remained totally inactive, and subsisted chiefly
on salt and damaged provisions, till the month of Novem∣ber,
when, being considerably diminished by sickness,
they were put on board again, and re-conveyed to Jamai∣ca.
He was afterwards re-enforced from England by four
ships of war, and about three thousand soldiers: but he
performed nothing worthy of the reputation he had ac∣quired;
and the people began to perceive that they had
mistaken his character.</P>
<P>§ VI. The affairs on the continent of Europe were
now more than ever embroiled. The King of Prussia
had demanded of the court of Vienna part of Silesia,
by virtue of old treaties of co-fraternity, which were
either obsolete or annulled; and promised to assist the
Queen with all his forces, in case she should comply with
his demand; but this being rejected with disdain, he en∣tered
Silesia at the head of an army, and prosecuted his
conquests with great rapidity. In the mean time, the
Queen o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hungary was crowned at Presburg, after hav∣ing
signed a capitulation, by which the liberties of that
kingdom were confirmed; and the Grand Duke her con∣sort
was, at her request, associated with her for ten years
in the government. At the same time the states of Hun∣gary
refused to receive a memorial from the Elector of
Bavaria. During these transactions, his Prussian Majesty
made his publick entrance into Breslau, and confirmed
all the privileges of the inhabitants. One of his generals
surprised the town and fortress of Jablunka, on the con∣fines
of Hungary: Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Dessau,
who commanded another army, which formed the block∣ade

of Great Glogau on the Oder, took the place by
scalade, made the Generals Wallis and Reyski prisoners,
with a thousand men that were in garrison: here, like∣wise,
the victor found the military chest, fifty pieces of
brass cannon, and a great quantity of ammunition.</P>
<P>§ VII. The Queen of Hungary had sollicited the ma∣ritime
powers for assistance, but found them fearful and
backward. Being obliged, therefore, to exert herself with
the more vigour, she ordered Count Neuperg to assemble
a body of forces, and endeavour to stop the progress of the
Prussians in Silesia. The two armies encountered each
other in the neighbourhood of Neiss, at a village called
Molwitz; and, after an obstinate dispute, the Austrians,
were obliged to retire, with the loss of four thousand men
killed, wounded, or taken. The advantage was dearly
purchased by the King of Prussia. His kinsman, Frederick
Margrave of Brandenburgh, and Lieutenant-General
Schuylemberg were killed in the engagement, together
with a great number of general officers, and about two
thousand soldiers. After this action, Brieg was surrender∣ed
to the Prussians, and he forced the important pass of
Fryewalde, which was defended by four thousand Austrian
hussars. The English and Dutch ministers, who accom∣panied
him in his progress, spared no pains to effect an ac∣commodation:
but the two sovereigns were too much irri∣tated
against each other, to acquiesce in any terms that
could be proposed. The Queen of Hungary was incensed
to find herself attacked, in the day of her distress, by a
prince to whom she had given no sort of provocation; and
his Prussian Majesty charged the court of Vienna with a
design either to assassinate, or carry him off by treachery:
a design which was disowned with expressions of indigna∣tion
and disdain. Count Neuperg being obliged to abandon
Silesia, in order to oppose the Bavarian arms in Bohemia,
the King of Prussia sent thither a detachment to join the
Elector, under the command of Count Deslau, who, in his
route, reduced Glatz and Neiss, almost without opposition:
then his master received the homage of the Silesian states
<PB N="58" REF="62"/>
at Breslaw, and returned to Berlin. I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> December, the
Prussian army was distributed in winter-quarters in Mora∣via,
after having taken Olmutz, the capital of that pro∣vince;
and in March his Prussian Majesty formed a camp
of observation in the neighbourhood of Magdeburg.</P>
<P>§ VIII. The Elector of Hanover was alarmed at the
success of the King of Prussia, in apprehension that he
would become too formidable a neighbour. A scheme was
said to have been proposed to the court of Vienna, for at∣tacking
that prince's electoral dominions, and dividing the
conquest: but it never was put in execution. Neverthe∣less,
the troops of Hanover were augmented: the auxiliary
Danes and Hessians in the pay of Great-Britain were or∣dered
to be in readiness to march; and a good number of
British forces encamped and prepared for embarkation.
The subsidy of three hundred thousand pounds, granted
by parliament, was remitted to the Queen of Hungary;
and every thing seemed to presage the vigorous interposi∣tion
of his Britannick Majesty. But in a little time after
his arrival at Hanover, that spirit of action seemed to flag,
even while her Hungarian Majesty tottered on the verge of
ruin. France resolved to seise this opportunity of crushing
the House of Austria. In order to intimidate the Elector
of Hanover, Mareschal Mallebois was sent with a nume∣rous
army into Westphalia; and this expedient proved
effectual. A treaty of neutrality was concluded; and the
King of Great-Britain engaged to vote for the Elector of
Bavaria at the ensuing election of an emperor. The design
of the French court was to raise this prince to the Impe∣rial
dignity, and furnish him with such succours as should
enable him to deprive the Queen of Hungary of her here∣ditary
dominions.</P>
<P>§ IX. While the French minister at Vienna endea∣voured
to amuse the Queen with the strongest assurances
of his master's friendship, a body of five-and-thirty thou∣sand
men began their march for Germany, in order to join
the Elector of Bavaria: another French army was assem∣bled
upon the Rhine; and the Count de Belleisle being
<PB N="59" REF="63"/>
provided with large sums of money, was sent to negociate
with different electors. Having thus secured a majority
of voices, he proceeded to Munich, where he presented the
Elector of Bavaria with a commission, appointing him gene∣ralissimo
of the French troops marching to his assistance;
and now the treaty of Nymphenburg was concluded. The
French King engaged to assist the Elector with his whole
power, towards raising him to the Imperial throne: the
Elector promised, that after his elevation he would never
attempt to recover any of the towns or provinces of the
empire which France had conquered: that he would, in his
Imperial capacity, renounce the barrier-treaty; and agree
that France should irrevocably retain whatever places she
should subdue in the Austrian Netherlands. The next
step of Belleisle was to negociate another treaty between
France and Prussia, importing, That the Elector of Bavaria
should possess Bohemia, Upper Austria, and the Tyrolese:
That the King of Poland should be gratified with Moravia
and UpperSilesia; and that his Prussian Majesty should retain
Lower Silesia, with the town of Neiss and the county of
Glatz. These precautions being taken, the Count de
Belleisle repaired to Franckfort, in quality of ambassador
and plenipotentiary from France, at the Imperial diet of
election. It was in this city that the French King pub∣lished
a declaration, signifying, that as the King of Great-Britain
had assembled an army to influence the approaching
election of an emperor, his Most Christian Majesty, as
guarantee of the treaty of Westphalia, had ordered some
troops to advance towards the Rhine, with a view to main∣tain
the tranquillity of the Germanick body, and secure the
freedom of the Imperial election.</P>
<P>§ X. In July, the Elector of Bavaria, being joined by
the French forces under Mareschal Broglio, surprised the
imperial city of Passau, upon the Danube: and entering
Upper Austria, at the head of seventy thousand men, took
possession of Lintz, where he received the homage of the
states of that country. Understanding that the garrison of
Vienna was very numerous, and that Count Palsi had
<PB N="60" REF="64"/>
assembled thirty thousand Hungarians in the neighbour∣hood
of this capital, he made no farther progress in Austria,
but marched into Bohemia, where he was re-enforced by a
considerable body of Saxons, under the command of Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Rutowski, natural son to the late King of Poland. By
this time his Polish Majesty had acceded to the treaty o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Nymphenburg, and declared war against the Queen of
Hungary, on the most frivolous pretences. The Electo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of Bavaria advanced to Prague, which was taken in the
night by scalade: an atchievement in which Maurice Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of Saxe, another natural son of the King of Poland, dis∣tinguished
himself at the head of the French forces. In
December the Elector of Bavaria made his public entry
into this capital, where he was proclaimed King o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Bohemia, and inaugurated with the usual solemnities: the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
he set out for Franckfort, to be present at the diet o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
election.</P>
<P>§ XI. At this period the Queen of Hungary saw herse<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
abandoned by all her allies, and seemingly devoted to de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
struction. She was not, however, forsaken by her courage
nor destitute of good officers, and an able ministry. She
retired to Presburgh, and in a pathetick Latin speech to the
states, expressed her confidence in the loyalty and valour o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
her Hungarian subjects. The nobility of that kingdom
touched with her presence and distress, assured her unani∣mously,
that they would sacrifice their lives and fortune<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in her defence. The ban being raised, that brave people
crowded to her standard; and the diet expressed their re∣sentment
against her enemy by a public edict, excluding
for ever the electoral house of Bavaria from the succession
to the crown of Hungary: yet, without the subsidy she
received from Great-Britain, their courage and attachment
would have proved ineffectual. By this supply she was
enabled to pay her army, erect magazines, complete her
warlike preparations, and put her strong places in a posture
of defence. In December her generals, Berenclau and
Mentzel, defeated Count Thoring, who commanded eight
thousand men, at the pass of Scardingen, and opening
<PB N="61" REF="65"/>
their way into Bavaria, laid the whole country under con∣tribution;
while Count Khevenhuller retook the city of
Lintz, and drove the French troops out of Austria. The
Grand Signor assured the Queen of Hungary, that far from
taking advantage of her troubles, he should seise all oppor∣tunities
to convince her of his friendship: the Pope per∣mitted
her to levy a tenth on the revenues of the clergy
within her dominions; and even to use all the church-plate
for the support of the war.</P>
<P>§ XII. As the Czarina expressed an inclination to assist
this unfortunate princess, the French court resolved to find
her employment in another quarter. They had already
gained over to their interest Count Gyllenburg, prime∣minister
and president of the chancery in Sweden. A dis∣pute
happening between him and Mr. Burnaby, the
British resident at Stockholm, some warm altercation pas∣sed
Mr. Burnaby was forbid the court, and published a
memorial in his own vindication: on the other hand, the
King of Sweden justified his conduct in a rescript sent to
all the foreign ministers. The King of Great-Britain had
proposed a subsidy-treaty to Sweden, which, from the in∣fluence
of French councils, was rejected. The Swedes
having assembled a numerous army in Finland, and equip∣ped
a large squadron of ships, declared war against Russia,
upon the most trifling pretences; and the fleet putting to
sea, commenced hostilities by blocking up the Russian
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ports in Livonia. A body of eleven thousand Swedes,
commanded by General Wrangel, having advanced to
Willmenstrand, were in August attacked and defeated by
General Lasci, at the head of thirty thousand Russians.
Count Lewenhaupt, who commanded the main army of
the Swedes, resolved to take vengeance for this disgrace,
after the Russian troops had retired into winter-quarters.
In December he marched towards Wybourg: but, receiv∣ing
letters from the Prince of Hesse-Homburgh, and the
Marquis de la Chetardie, the French ambassador at Peters∣burgh,
informing him of the surprising revolution which
had just happened in Russia, and proposing a suspension of
<PB N="62" REF="66"/>
hostilities, he retreated with his army, in order to wait for
further instructions; and the two courts agreed to a cessa∣tion
of arms for three months.</P>
<P>§ XIII. The Russians had been for some time discon∣tented
with their government. The late Czarina was in∣fluenced
chiefly by German councils, and employed a great
number of foreigners in her service. These causes of dis∣content
produced factions and conspiracies; and when they
were discovered, the Empress treated the authors of them
with such severity as increased the general disaffection.
Besides, they were displeased at the manner in which she
had settled the succession. The Prince of Brunswick-Lunenburgh-Bevern, father to the young Czar, was not
at all agreeable to the Russian nobility, and his consort, the
Princess Anne of Mecklenburgh, having assumed the reins
of government during her son's minority, seemed to follow
the maxims of her aunt, the late Czarina. The Russian
grandees and generals, therefore, turned their eyes upon
the Princess Elisabeth, who was daughter to Peter the
Great, and the darling of the empire. The French am∣bassador
gladly concurred in a project for deposing a prin∣cess
who was well affected to the house of Austria. General
Lasci approved of the design, which was chiefly conducted
by the Prince of Hesse-Homburgh, who, in the reigns of
the Empress Catharine and Peter II. had been generalissi∣mo
of the Russian army. The good will and concurrence
of the troops being secured, two regiments of guards took
possession of all the avenues of the imperial palace at Pe∣tersburgh.
The Princess Elisabeth, putting herself at the
head of one thousand men, on the fifth day of December
entered the winter-palace, where the Princess of Mecklen∣burgh
and the infant Czar resided. She advanced into the
chamber where the Princess and her consort lay and desired
them to rise, and quit the palace, adding, that their persons
were safe; and that they could not justly blame her for
asserting her right. At the same time, the Counts Oster∣man,
Golofkin, Mingden, and Munich were arrested:
their papers and effects were seised, and their persons
<PB N="63" REF="67"/>
conveyed to Schlisselbourg, a fortress on the Neva. Early
in the morning the senate assembling, declared all that
had passed since the reign of Peter II. to be usurpation;
and that the imperial dignity belonged of right to the
Princess Elisabeth: she was immediately proclaimed Em∣press
of all the Russias, and recognized by the army in
Finland. She forthwith published a general act of indem∣nity:
she created the Prince of Hesse-Homburgh general∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>issimo
of her armies: she restored the Dolgorucky family
to their honours and estates: she recalled and rewarded
all those who had been banished for favouring her preten∣sions:
she mitigated the exile of the Duke of Courland,
by indulging him with a maintenance more suitable to his
rank: she released General Wrangel, Count Wasaburg,
and the other Swedish officers, who had been taken at the
battle of Willmenstrand: and the Princess Anne of Meck∣lenburgh,
with her consort and children, were sent under
a strong guard, to Riga, the capital of Livonia.</P>
<P>§ XIV. Amidst these tempests of war and revolution,
the States-General wisely determined to preserve their own
tranquillity. It was, doubtless, their interest to avoid the
dangers and expense of a war, and to profit by that stag∣mation
of commerce which would necessarily happen
among their neighbours that were at open enmity with
each other: besides, they were over-awed by the declarati∣ons
of the French monarch on one side; by the power,
activity, and pretensions of his Prussian Majesty on the
other; and they dreaded the prospect of a Stadtholder at
the head of their army. These at least were the sentiments
of many Dutch patriots, re-enforced by others that acted
under French influence. But the Prince of Orange num∣bered
among his partisans and adherents many persons of
dignity and credit in the commonwealth: he was adored
by the populace, who loudly exclaimed against their go∣vernors,
and clamoured for a war, without ceasing. This
national spirit, joined to the remonstrances and requisitions
made by the courts of Vienna and London, obliged the
States to issue orders for an augmentation of their forces:
<PB N="64" REF="68"/>
but these were executed so slowly, that neither France nor
Prussia had much cause to take umbrage at their prepara∣tions.
In Italy the King of Sardinia declared for the house
of Austria: the republick of Genoa was deeply engaged in
the French interest: the Pope, the Venetians, and the
dukedom of Tuscany were neutral: the King of Naples
resolved to support the claim of his family to the Austrian
dominions in Italy, and began to make preparations accor∣dingly.
His mother, the Queen of Spain, had formed a
plan for erecting these dominions into a monarchy for her
second son Don Philip; and a body of fifteen thousand
men being embarked at Barcelona, were transported to
Orbitello, under the convoy of the united squadrons of
France and Spain. While Admiral Haddock, with twelve
ships of the line, lay at anchor in the bay of Gibraltar, the
Spanish fleet passed the straits in the night, and was joined
by the French squadron from Toulon. The British ad∣miral
sailing from Gibraltar, fell in with them in a few
days, and found both squadrons drawn up in line of battle.
As he bore down upon the Spanish fleet, the French admi∣ral
sent a flag of truce, to inform him, that as the French
and Spaniards were engaged in a joint-expedition, he
should be obliged to act in concert with his master's allies.
This interposition prevented an engagement. The com∣bined
fleets amounting to double the number of the
English squadron, Admiral Haddock was obliged to desist;
and proceeded to Port-Mahon, leaving the enemy to pro∣secute
their voyage without molestation. The people of
England were incensed at this transaction, and did not
scruple to affirm, that the hands of the British admiral
were tied up by the neutrality of Hanover.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the month of July two ships of Haddock's squadron falling it with three French ships of war, Captain Barnet, the English commodore, supposing them to be Spanish register ships, fired a shot, in order to bring them to; and they refusing to comply with this signal, a sharp en∣gagement ensued: after they had fought several hours, the French com∣mander ceased firing, and thought proper to come to an explanation when he and Barnet parted with mutual apologies.</P>
<P>In the course of this year a dangerous conspiracy was discovered at New-York in North America. One Hewson, a low publican, had engaged se∣veral negroes in a design to destroy the town, and massacre the people. Fire was set to several parts of the city; nine or ten negroes were appre∣hended, convicted, and burned alive. Hewson, with his wise, and a servant-maid, privy to the plot, were found guilty, and hanged, though they died protesting their innocence.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="69"/>
§ XV. The court of Madrid seemed to have shaken off
that indolence and phlegm which had formerly disgraced
the councils of Spain. They no sooner learned the desti∣nation
of Commodore Anson, who had sailed from Spit∣head
in the course of the preceding year, than they sent
Don Pizzaro, with a more powerful squadron, upon the
same voyage, to defeat his design. He accordingly steered
the same course, and actually fell in with one or two ships
of the British armament, near the Straits of Magellan:
but he could not weather a long and furious tempest
through which Mr. Anson proceeded into the South-Sea.
One of the Spanish ships perished at sea: another was
wrecked on the coast of Brazil; and Pizzaro bore away
for the Rio de la Plata, where he arrived with the three
remaining ships, in a shattered condition, after having lost
twelve hundred men by sickness and famine. The Spa∣niards
exerted the same vigilance and activity in Europe.
Their privateers were so industrious and successful, that
in the beginning of this year they had taken, since the
commencement of the war, four hundred and seven ships
belonging to the subjects of Great-Britain, valued at near
four millions of piastres. The traders had, therefore, too
much cause to complain, considering the formidable fleets
which were maintained for the protection of commerce.
In the course of the summer, Sir John Norris had twice
sailed towards the coast of Spain, at the head of a power∣ful
squadron, without taking any effectual step for annoy∣ing
the enemy, as if the sole intention of the ministry had
been to expose the nation to the ridicule and contempt of
its enemies. The inactivity of the British arms appears
the more inexcusable, when we consider the great arma∣ments
which had been prepared. The land-forces of
<PB N="66" REF="70"/>
Great-Britain, exclusive of the Danish and Hessian auxi∣liaries,
amounted to sixty thousand men; and the fleet
consisted of above one hundred ships of war, manned by
fifty-four thousand sailors.</P>
<P>§ XVI. The general discontent of the people had a ma∣nifest
influence upon the election of members for the new
parliament, which produced one of the most violent con∣tests
between the two parties, which had happened since
the Revolution. All the adherents of the Prince of Wale
concurred with the country party, in opposition to the
minister; and the Duke of Argyle exerted himself so suc∣cessfully
among the shires and boroughs of Scotland, that
the partisans of the ministry could not secure six member
out of the whole number returned from North-Britain▪
They were, however, much more fortunate in the election
of the sixteen peers, who were chosen literally according to
the list transmitted from court. Instructions were deliver¦ed
by the constituents to a great number of members re¦turned
for cities and counties, exhorting and requiring
them to oppose a standing army in time of peace; to vote
for the mitigation of excise laws; for the repeal of septenni¦al
parliaments; and for the limitation of placemen in the
House of Commons. They, likewise, insisted upon thei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
examining into the particulars of the publick expense
and endeavouring to redress the grievances of the nation
Obstinate struggles were maintained in all parts of the uni¦ted
kingdom with uncommon ardour and perseverance; and
such a national spirit of opposition prevailed, that, notwith¦standing
the whole weight of ministerial influence, the con¦trary
interest seemed to preponderate in the new parliament.</P>
<P>§ XVII. The King returned to England in the mont<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of October; and on the first day of December the sessio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was opened. Mr. Onslow being re-chosen speaker was
approved of by his Majesty, who spoke in the usual stile
to both Houses. He observed that the former parliament
had formed the strongest resolutions in favour of the
Queen of Hungary, for the maintenance of the prag∣matick
sanction; for the preservation of the balance <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="67" REF="71"/>
power, and the peace and liberties of Europe; and that
if the other powers which were under the like engage∣ments
with him had answered the just expectations
so solemnly given, the support of the common cause
would have been attended with less difficulty. He said,
he had endeavoured, by the most proper and early appli∣cations,
to induce other powers that were united with him
by the ties of common interest to concert such measures
as so important and critical a conjuncture required: that
where an accommodation seemed necessary, he had la∣boured
to reconcile princes whose union would have been
the most effectual means to prevent the mischiefs which
had happened, and the best security for the interest and
safety of the whole. He owned his endeavours had not
hitherto produced the desired effect; though he was not
without hope, that a just sense of approaching danger
would give a more favourable turn to the councils of
other nations. He represented the necessity of putting the
kingdom in such a posture of defence as would enable
him to improve all opportunities of maintaining the liber∣ties
of Europe, and defeat any attempts that should be
made against him and his dominions; and he recommend∣ed
unanimity, vigour, and dispatch. The House of Com∣mons
having appointed their several committees, the
Speaker reported the King's speech; and Mr. Herbert
moved for an address of thanks, including an approbation
of the means by which the war had been prosecuted.
The motion being seconded by Mr. Trevor, Lord Noel
Somerset stood up, and moved that the House would
in their address desire his Majesty not to engage these
kingdoms in a war for the preservation of his foreign
dominions. He was supported by that incorruptible pa∣triot,
Mr. Shippen, who declared he was neither ashamed
nor afraid to affirm, that thirty years had made no change
in any of his political opinions. He said he was grown
old in the House of Commons; that time had verified the
predictions he had formerly uttered; and that he had seen
his conjectures ripened into knowledge. “If my country
<PB N="68" REF="72"/>
(added he) has been so unfortunate as once more to com∣mit
her interest to men who propose to themselves no
advantage from their trust but that of selling it, I may,
perhaps, fall once more under censure for declaring
my opinion, and be once more treated as a criminal,
for asserting what they who punish me cannot deny;
for maintaining that Hanoverian maxims are inconsist∣ent
with the happiness of this nation; and for preserv∣ing
the caution so strongly inculcated by those patriots
who framed the act of settlement, and conferred upon
the present royal family their title to the throne.” He
particularised the instances in which the ministry had
acted in diametrical opposition to that necessary consti∣tution;
and he insisted on the necessity of taking some
step to remove the apprehensions of the people, who be∣gan
to think themselves in danger of being sacrificed to
the security of foreign dominions. Mr. Gibbon, who
spoke on the same side of the question, expatiated
upon the absurdity of returning thanks for the prosecu∣tion
of a war which had been egregiously mismanaged.
“What! (said he) are our thanks to be solemnly re∣turned
for defeats, disgrace, and losses, the ruin of
our merchants, the imprisonment of our sailors, idle
shows of armaments, and useless expenses?” Sir Ro∣bert
Walpole having made a short speech in defence of the
first motion for an address, was answered by Mr. Pul∣teney,
who seemed to be animated with a double propor∣tion
of patriot indignation. He asserted, that from a
review of that minister's conduct since the beginning of
the dispute with Spain, it would appear that he had been
guilty not only of single errors, but of deliberate trea∣chery:
that he had always co-operated with the enemies
of his country, and sacrificed to his private interest the
happiness and honour of the British nation. He then
entered into a detail of that conduct against which he
had so often declaimed; and being transported by an
over-heated imagination, accused him of personal attach∣ment
and affection to the enemies of the kingdom. A
<PB N="69" REF="73"/>
charge that was doubtless the result of exaggerated ani∣mosity,
and served only to invalidate the other articles
of imputation that were much better founded. His ob∣jections
were over-ruled; and the address, as at first pro∣posed,
was presented to his Majesty.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. This small advantage, however, the minister
did not consider as a proof of his having ascertained an
undoubted majority in the House of Commons. There
was a great number of disputed elections; and the dis∣cussion
of these was the point on which the people had
turned their eyes, as the criterion of the minister's power
and credit. In the first which was heard at the bar of
the House, he carried his point by a majority of six only;
and this he looked upon as a defeat rather than a victory.
His enemies exulted in their strength: as they knew they
should be joined, in matters of importance, by several
members who voted against them on this occasion. The
inconsiderable majority that appeared on the side of the
administration plainly proved that the influence of the
minister was greatly diminished, and seemed to prognosti∣cate
his further decline. This consideration induced
some individuals to declare against him as a setting sun,
from whose beams they could expect no further warmth.
His adherents began to tremble; and he himself had oc∣casion
for all his art and equanimity. The court interest
was not sufficient to support the election of their own
members for Westminster. The high-bailiff had been
guilty of some illegal practices at the poll; and three
justices of the peace had, on pretence of preventing riots,
sent for a military force to over-awe the election. A peti∣tion
presented by the electors of Westminster was taken
into consideration by the House; and the election was de∣clared
void by a majority of four voices. The high-bailiff
was taken into custody: the officer who ordered the sol∣diers
to march, and the three justices who signed the let∣ter,
in consequence of which he acted, were reprimanded
on their knees at the bar of the House.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="74"/>
§ XIX. The country-party maintained the advan∣tage
they had gained in deciding upon several other
controverted elections; and Sir Robert Walpole tot∣tered
on the brink of ruin. He knew that the majo∣rity
of a single vote would at any time commit him
prisoner to the Tower, should ever the motion be made;
and he saw that his safety could be effected by no other
expedient but that of dividing the opposition. Towards
the accomplishment of this purpose he employed all his
credit and dexterity. His emissaries did not fail to tam∣per
with those members of the opposite party who were
the most likely to be converted by their arguments.
A message was sent by the Bishop of Oxford to the
Prince of Wales, importing, That if his royal high∣ness
would write a letter of condescension to the
King, he and all his counsellors should be taken into fa∣vour;
that fifty thousand pounds should be added to his
revenue; four times that sum be disbursed immediately
for the payment of his debts; and suitable provision be
made in due time for all his followers. The Prince de∣clined
this proposal. He declared that he would accept
no such conditions while Sir Robert Walpole continued
to direct the public affairs: that he looked upon him as
a bar between his Majesty and the affections of his
people; as the author of the national grievances both
at home and abroad; and as the sole cause of that
contempt which Great-Britain had incurred in all the
courts of Europe. His royal highness was now chief
of this formidable party, revered by the whole na∣tion
—a party which had gained the ascendancy in
the House of Commons; which professed to act upon
the principles of publick virtue; which demanded the
fall of an odious minister, as a sacrifice due to an injured
people; and declared that no temptation could shake
their virtue; that no art could dissolve the cement by
which they were united. Sir Robert Walpole, though
repulsed in his attempt upon the Prince of Wales, was
more successful in his other endeavours. He resolved to
<PB N="71" REF="75"/>
try his strength once more in the House of Commons,
in another disputed election; and had the mortification
to see the majority augmented to sixteen voices. He de∣clared
he would never more sit in that House; and
next day, which was the third of February, the King
adjourned both Houses of parliament to the eighteenth
day of the same month. In this interim Sir Robert Wal∣pole
was created Earl of Orford, and resigned all his em∣ployments.</P>
<P>§ XX. At no time of his life did he acquit himself with
such prudential policy as he now displayed. He found
means to separate the parts that composed the opposition,
and to transfer the popular odium from himself to those
who had professed themselves his keenest adversaries. The
country-party consisted of the Tories, re-enforced by
discontented Whigs, who had either been disappointed in
their own ambitious views, or felt for the distresses of
their country, occasioned by a weak and worthless admi∣nistration.
The old patriots, and the Whigs whom they
had joined, acted upon very different, and, indeed, upon
opposite principles of government; and, therefore, they
were united only by the ties of convenience. A coalition
was projected between the discontented Whigs and those
of the same denomination who acted in the ministry.
Some were gratified with titles and offices; and all were
assured, that in the management of affairs a new system
would be adopted, according to the plan they themselves
should propose. The court required nothing of them,
but that the Earl of Orford should escape with impunity.
His place of Chancellor of the Exchequer was bestowed
upon Mr. Sandys, who was likewise appointed a lord of
the Treasury; and the Earl of Wilmington succeeded him
as first commissioner of that board. Lord Harrington
being dignified with the title of Earl, was declared presi∣dent
of the council; and in his room Lord Carteret be∣came
secretary of state. The Duke of Argyle was made
master-general of the Ordnance, colonel of his Majesty's
royal regiment of horse-guards, field-marshal and comman∣der
<PB N="72" REF="76"/>
in chief of all the forces in South-Britain; but, find∣ing
himself disappointed in his expectations of the coalition,
h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in less than a month, renounced all these employments.
The Marquis of Tweedale was appointed secretary of state
for Scotland, a post which had been long suppressed: Mr.
Pulteney was sworn of the privy council, and afterwards
created Earl of Bath. The Earl of Winchelsea and Not∣tingham
was preferred to the head of the Admiralty, in the
room of Sir Charles Wager; and, after the resignation of
the Duke of Argyle, the Earl of Stair was appointed field
marshal of all his Majesty's forces, as well as ambassador-extraordinary
to the States-General. On the seventeenth
day of February the Prince of Wales, attended by a numer∣ous
retinue of his adherents, waited on his Majesty, who
received him graciously, and ordered his guards to be
restored. Lord Carteret and Mr. Sandys were the first
who embraced the offers of the Court, without the consent
or privity of any other leaders in the opposition, except that
of Mr. Pulteney; but they declared to their friends, they
would still proceed upon patriot principles: that they would
concur in promoting an enquiry into past measures; and
in enacting necessary laws to secure the constitution from
the practices of corruption. These professions were believ∣ed,
not only by their old coadjutors in the House of Com∣mons,
but also by the nation in general. The reconcilia∣tion
between the King and the Prince of Wales, together
with the change in the ministry, were celebrated with pub∣lick
rejoicings all over the kingdom; and immediately
after the adjournment nothing but concord appeared in
the House of Commons.</P>
<P>§ XXI. But this harmony was of short duration. It
soon appeared, that those who had declaimed the loudest
for the liberties of their country had been actuated solely
by the most sordid, and even the most ridiculous motives
of self interest. Jealousy and mutual distrust ensued
between them and their former confederates. The nation
complained, that, instead of a total change of men and
measures, they saw the old ministry strengthened by this
<PB N="73" REF="77"/>
coalition; and the same interest in parliament predominat∣ing
with redoubled influence. They branded the new
converts as apostates and betrayers of their country; and
in the transports of their indignation, they entirely over∣looked
the old object of their resentment. That a noble∣man
of pliant principles, narrow fortune, and un∣bounded
ambition, should forsake his party for the blan∣dishment
of affluence, power, and authority, will not
appear strange to any person acquainted with the human
heart; but the sensible part of mankind will always reflect
with amazement upon the conduct of a man, who seeing
himself idolized by his fellow-citizens, as the first and
firmest patriot of the kingdom, as one of the most shining
ornaments of his country, could give up all his popularity,
and incur the contempt or detestation of mankind, for the
wretched consideration of an empty title, without office,
influence, or the least substantial appendage. One cannot,
without an emotion of grief, contemplate such an instance
of infatuation—One cannot but lament, that such glory
should have been so weakly forfeited: that such talents
should have been lost to the cause of liberty and virtue.
Doubtless, he flattered himself with the hope of one day
directing the councils of his sovereign; but this was never
accomplished, and he remained a solitary monument of
blasted ambition. Before the change in the ministry, Mr.
Pulteney moved that the several papers relating to the con∣duct
of the war which had been laid before the House
should be referred to a select committee, who should exa∣mine
strictly into the particulars, and make a report to the
House of their remarks and objections. The motion in∣troduced
a debate; but, upon a division, was rejected by
a majority of three voices. Petitions having been present∣ed
by the merchants of London, Bristol, Liverpool, Glas∣gow,
and almost all the trading towns in the kingdom, com∣plaining
of the losses they had sustained by the bad conduct
of the war, the House resolved itself into a committee, to
deliberate on these remonstrances. The articles of the
London petition were explained by Mr. Glover, an eminent
<PB N="74" REF="78"/>
merchant of that city. Six days were spent in perusing
papers and examining witnesses: then the same gentleman
summed up the evidence, and in a pathetick speech endea∣voured
to demonstrate, that the commerce of Great-Britain
had been exposed to the insults and rapine of the Spa∣niards,
not by inattention or accident, but by one uniform
and continued design. This inquiry being resumed after
the adjournment, copies of instructions to admirals and
captains of cruising ships were laid before the House: the
Commons passed several resolutions, upon which a bill wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
prepared for the better protecting and securing the trad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and navigation of the kingdom. It made its way through
the Lower House; but was thrown out by the Lords▪
The pension-bill was revived and sent up to the Peers
where it was again rejected, Lord Carteret voting against
that very measure which he had so lately endeavoured to
promote. On the ninth day of March Lord Limeric<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
made a motion for appointing a committee to enquire in
to the conduct of affairs for the last twenty years: he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
seconded by Sir John St. Aubyn, and supported by Mr▪
Velters Cornwall, Mr. Phillips, Mr. W. Pitt, and Lord
Percival, the new member for Westminster, who had al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
ready signalized himself by his eloquence and capacity▪
The motion was opposed by Sir Charles Wager, Mr▪
Pelham, and Mr. Henry Fox, surveyor-general to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Majesty's works, and brother to Lord Ilchester. Though
the opposition was faint and frivolous, the proposal wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
rejected by a majority of two voices. Lord Limerick, no
yet discouraged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1742.</NOTE> made a motion, on the twenty-third day
of March, for an enquiry into the conduct of Robert Ear<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of Orford, for the last ten years of his administration
and, after a sharp debate, it was carried in the affirmative▪
The House resolved to choose a secret committee by ballot
and in the mean time presented an address to the King
assuring him of their fidelity, zeal, and affection.</P>
<P>§ XXII. Sir Robert Godschall having moved for lea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
to bring in a bill to repeal the act for septennial parlia∣ments,
he was seconded by Sir John Barnard; but warmly
<PB N="75" REF="79"/>
opposed by Mr. Pulteney and Mr. Sandys; and the question
passed in the negative. The committee of secresy being
chosen, began to examine evidence, and Mr. Paxton, sol∣licitor
to the Treasury, refusing to answer such questions
as were put to him, Lord Limerick, chairman of the com∣mittee,
complained to the House of his obstinacy. He
was first taken into custody; and still persisting in his re∣fusal,
committed to Newgate. Then his lordship moved,
that leave should be given to bring in a bill for indemnify∣ing
evidence against the Earl of Orford; and it was
actually prepared by a decision of the majority. In the
House of Lords it was vigorously opposed by Lord Carteret,
and as strenuously supported by the Duke of Argyle; but
fell upon a division, by the weight of superior numbers.
Those members in the House of Commons who heartily
wished that the enquiry might be prosecuted were ex∣tremely
incensed at the fate of this bill. A committee
was appointed to search the journals of the Lords for pre∣cedents:
their report being read, Lord Strange, son of the
Earl of Derby, moved for a resolution, “That the Lords
refusing to concur with the Commons of Great-Britain,
in an indemnification necessary to the effectual carrying
on the enquiry now depending in parliament, is an ob∣struction
to justice, and may prove fatal to the liberties of
this nation.”—This motion, which was seconded by Lord
Quarendon, son of the Earl of Lichfield, gave rise to a
warm debate; and Mr. Sandys declaimed against it, as a
step that would bring on an immediate dissolution of the
present form of government. It is really amazing to see
with what effrontery some men can shift their maxims,
and openly contradict the whole tenor of their former
conduct. Mr. Sandys did not pass uncensured: he su∣stained
some severe sarcasms on his apostacy, from Sir John
Hynde Cotton, who refuted all his objections: neverthe∣less,
the motion passed in the negative. Notwithstanding
this great obstruction, purposely thrown in the way of the
enquiry, the secret committee discovered many flagrant
instances of fraud and corruption in which the Earl of
<PB N="76" REF="80"/>
Orford had been concerned. It appeared that he had
granted fraudulent contracts for paying the troops in the
West-Indies: that he had employed iniquitous arts to in∣fluence
elections: that for secret-service, during the last
ten years, he had touched one million four hundred fifty-three
thousand four hundred pounds of the publick money:
that above fifty thousand pounds of this sum had been paid
to authors and printers of news-papers and political
tracts written in defence of the ministry: that on the very
day which preceded his resignation he had signed orders on
the civil-list revenues for above thirty thousand pounds:
but as the cash remaining in the Exchequer did not much
exceed fourteen thousand pounds, he had raised the remain∣ing
part of the thirty thousand, by pawning the orders to a
banker. The committee proceeded to make further progress
in their scrutiny, and had almost prepared a third report,
when they were interrupted by the prorogation of parlia∣ment.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. The ministry, finding it was necessary to take
some step for conciliating the affection of the people, gave
way to a bill for excluding certain officers from seats in
the House of Commons. They passed another for en∣couraging
the linen manufacture; a third for regulating
the trade of the plantations; and a fourth to prevent the
marriage of lunaticks. They voted forty thousand sea-men,
and sixty-two thousand five hundred landmen for the
service of the current year. They provided for the sub∣sidies
to Denmark and Hesse-Cassel, and voted five hun∣dred
thousand pounds to the Queen of Hungary. The
expense of the year amounted to near six millions, raised by
the land tax at four shillings in the pound, by a malt-tax,
by one million from the sinking fund, by annuities granted
upon it for eight hundred thousand pounds, and a loan of
one million six hundred thousand pounds, from the Bank.
In the month of July, John Lord Gower was appointed
keeper of his Majesty's privy-seal: Allen Lord Bathurst was
made captain of the band of pensioners; and on the fifteenth
day of the month, Mr. Pulteney took his seat in the House
of Peers, as Earl of Bath. The King closed the session in
<PB N="77" REF="81"/>
the usual way, after having given them to understand, that
a treaty of peace was concluded between the Queen of
Hungary and the King of Prussia, under his mediation;
and that the late successes of the Austrian arms were in a
great measure owing to the generous assistance afforded by
the British nation.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. By this time great changes had happened in
the affairs of the continent. The elector of Bavaria was
chosen Emperor of Germany at Franckfort on the Maine,
and crowned by the name of Charles VII. on the twelfth
day of February. Thither the imperial diet was removed
from Ratisbon: they confirmed his election, and indulged
him with a subsidy of fifty Roman months, amounting to
about two hundred thousand pounds sterling. In the
mean time, the Austrian general, Khevenhuller, ravaged
his electorate, and made himself master of Munich, the
capital of Bavaria: he likewise laid part of the Palatinate
under contribution, in resentment for that Elector's having
sent a body of his troops to re-enforce the Imperial army.
In March, Count Saxe, with a detachment of French
and Bavarians, reduced Egra; and the Austrians were
obliged to evacuate Bavaria, though they afterwards re∣turned.
Khevenhuller took post in the neighbourhood of
Passau, and detached General Bernclau to Dinglefing on
the Iser, to observe the motions of the enemy, who were
now become extremely formidable. In May, a detach∣ment
of French and Bavarians advanced to the castle of
Hilkersbergh on the Danube, with a view to take possession
of a bridge over the river: the Austrian garrison immedi∣diately
marched out to give them battle, and a severe
action ensued, in which the Imperialists were defeated.</P>
<P>§ XXV. In the beginning of the year, the Queen of
Hungary had assembled two considerable armies in Mora∣via
and Bohemia. Prince Charles of Lorraine, at the head
of fifty thousand men, advanced against the Saxons and
Prussians, who thought proper to retire with precipiation
from Moravia, which they had invaded. Then the Prince
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook the route to Bohemia; and Marshal Broglio, who com∣manded
<PB N="78" REF="82"/>
the French forces in that country, must have
fallen a sacrifice, had not the King of Prussia received a
strong re-enforcement, and entered that kingdom before
his allies could be attacked. The two armies advanced
towards each other; and, on the seventeenth of May,
joined battle at Czaslaw, where the Austrians at first gain∣ed
a manifest advantage, and penetrated as far as the Prus∣sian
baggage: then the irregulars began to plunder so eagerly,
that they neglected every other consideration. The Prus∣sian
infantry took this opportunity to rally: the battle was
renewed, and, after a very obstinate contest, the victory
was snatched out of the hands of the Austrians, who were
obliged to retire, with the loss of five thousand men killed,
and twelve hundred taken by the enemy. The Prussians
paid dear for the honour of remaining on the field of battle;
and from the circumstances of this action the King is
said to have conceived a disgust to the war. When the
Austrians made such progress in the beginning of the en∣gagement,
he rode off with great expedition, untilhe was
recalled by a message from his general, the Count de Schwe∣rin,
assuring his Majesty that there was no danger of a
defeat. Immediately after this battle, he discovered an in∣clination
to accommodate all differences with the Queen
of Hungary. The Earl of Hyndford, ambassador from
the court of Great-Britain, who accompanied him in this
campaign, and was vested with full powers by her Hunga∣rian
Majesty, did not fail to cultivate this favourable dis∣position;
and on the first day of June, a treaty of peace be∣tween
the two powers was concluded at Breslaw. The
Queen ceded to his Prussian Majesty the Upper and Lower
Silesia, with the county of Glatz in Bohemia; and he
charged himself with the payment of the sum lent by the
merchants of London to the late Emperor, on the Silesian
revenues. He likewise engaged to observe a strict neutra∣lity
during the war, and to withdraw his forces from Bo∣hemia
in fifteen days after the ratification of the treaty, in
which were comprehended the King of Great-Britain
Elector of Hanover, the Czarina, the King of Denmark,
<PB N="79" REF="83"/>
the States-General, the house of Wolfenbuttle, and the
King of Poland Elector of Saxony, on certain conditions,
which were accepted.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. The King of Prussia recalled his troops; while
Mareschal Broglio, who commanded the French auxilia∣ries
in that kingdom, and the Count de Belleisle, abandon∣ed
their magazines and baggage, and retired with precipi∣tation
under the cannon of Prague. There they entrenched
themselves in an advantageous situation; and Prince Charles
being joined by the other body of Austrians, under Prince
Lobkowitz, encamped in sight of them, on the hills of
Girisnitz. The Grand Duke of Tuscany arrived in the
Austrian army, of which he took the command; and the
French generals offered to surrender Prague, Egra, and all
the other places they possessed in Bohemia, provided they
might be allowed to march off with their arms, artillery,
and baggage. The proposal was rejected, and Prague in∣vested
on all sides about the end of July. Though the
operations of the siege were carried on in an aukward and
slovenly manner, the place was so effectually blocked up,
that famine must have compelled the French to surrender
at discretion, had not very extraordinary efforts been made
for their relief. The Emperor had made advances to the
Queen of Hungary. He promised that the French forces
should quit Bohemia, and evacuate the empire; and he
offered to renounce all pretensions to the kingdom of Bohe∣mia,
on condition that the Austians would restore Bavaria:
but these conditions were declined by the court of Vienna.
The King of France was no sooner apprised of the condi∣tion
to which the Generals Broglio and Belleisle were
reduced, than he sent orders to Marshal Maillebois, who
commanded his army on the Rhine, to march to their re∣lief.
His troops were immediately put in motion; and
when they reached Amberg in the Upper Palatinate were
joined to the French and Imperialists from Bavaria. Prince
Charles of Lorraine having received intelligence of their
junction and design, left eighteen thousand men to main∣tain
the blockade of Prague, under the command of Gene∣ral
<PB N="80" REF="84"/>
Festitiz, while he himself, with the rest of his army,
advanced to Haydon on the frontiers of Bohemia. There
he was joined by Count Khevenhuller, who from Bavaria
had followed the enemy, now commanded by Count Sec∣kendorff,
and the Count de Saxe. Seckendorff, however,
was sent back to Bavaria, while Marshal Maillebois enter∣ed
Bohemia on the twenty-fifth day of September. But
he marched with such precaution, that Prince Charles
could not bring him to an engagement. Mean while
Festititz, for want of sufficient force, was obliged to aban∣don
the blockade of Prague, and the French generals being
now at liberty, took post at Leutmaritz. Maillebois ad∣vanced
as far as Kadan: but seeing the Austrians possessed
of all the passes of the mountains, he marched back to the
Palatinate, and was miserably harrassed in his retreat by
Prince Charles, who had left a strong body with Prince
Lobkowitz, to watch the motions of Belleisle and Broglio▪</P>
<P>§ XXVII. These generals seeing themselves surrounded
on all hands, returned to Prague, from whence Broglio
made his escape in the habit of a courier, and was sent to
command the army of Maillebois, who was by this time
disgraced. Prince Lobkowitz, who now directed the
blockade of Prague, had so effectually cut off all commu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nication
between the place and the adjacent country, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in a little time the French troops were reduced to great
extremity, both from the severity of the season, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
want of provision. They were already reduced to the nece<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sity
of eating horse-flesh, and unclean animals; and the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
had no other prospect but that of perishing by famine <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
war, when their commander formed the scheme of a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
treat, which was actually put in execution. Having take
some artful precautions to deceive the enemy, he, in the
middle of December, departed from Prague at midnigh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
with about fourteen thousand men, thirty pieces of arti∣lery,
and some of the principal citizens as hostages for the
safety of nine hundred soldiers whom he had left in garrison
Notwithstanding the difficulties he must have encounter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
at that season of the year, in a broken and unfrequented roa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="81" REF="85"/>
which he purposely chose, he marched with such expedi∣tion,
that he had gained the passes of the mountains, be∣fore
he was overtaken by the horse and hussars of Prince
Lobkowitz. The fatigue and hardships which the misera∣ble
soldiers underwent are inexpressible. A great number
perished in the snow, and many hundreds, fainting with
weariness, cold, and hunger, were left to the mercy of the
Austrian irregulars, consisting of the most barbarous people
on the face of the earth. The Count de Belleisle, though
tortured with the hip-gout, behaved with surprising reso∣lution
and activity. He caused himself to be carried in a
litter to every place where he thought his presence was
necessary, and made such dispositions, that the pursuers
never could make an impression upon the body of his troops:
but all his artillery, baggage, and even his own equipage,
fell into the hands of the enemy. On the twenty-ninth
day of December, he arrived at Egra, from whence he
proceeded to Alsace without further molestation: but,
when he returned to Versailles, he met with a very cold re∣ception,
notwithstanding the gallant exploit which he had
performed. After his escape, Prince Lobkowitz returned
to Prague, and the small garrison which Belleisle had left
in that place surrendered upon honourable terms; so that
this capital reverted to the house of Austria.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. The King of Great-Britain resolving to make
a powerful diversion in the Netherlands, had, in the month
of April, ordered sixteen thousand effective men to be em∣barked
for that country; but, as this step was taken with∣out
any previous concert with the States-General, the
Earl of Stair, destined to the command of the forces in
Flanders, was in the mean time appointed ambassador
extraordinary and plenipotentiary to their High-Mighti∣nesses,
in order to persuade them to co-operate vigorously
in the plan which his Britannick Majesty had formed—A
plan by which Great-Britain was engaged as a principal
in a foreign dispute, and entailed upon herself the whole
burthen of an expensive war, big with ruin and disgrace.
England, from being the umpire, was now become a party
<PB N="82" REF="86"/>
in all continental quarrels; and, instead of trimming the
balance of Europe, lavished away her blood and treasure
in supporting the interest and allies of a puny electorate in
the north of Germany. The King of Prussia had been
at variance with the Elector of Hanover. The duchy of
Mecklenburgh was the avowed subject of dispute: but his
Prussian Majesty is said to have had other more provoking
causes of complaint, which, however, he did not think
proper to divulge. The King of Great-Britain found it
convenient to accommodate these differences. In the course
of this summer, the two powers concluded a convention,
in consequence of which the troops of Hanover evacuated
Mecklenburgh, and three regiments of Brandenburgh took
possession of those bailiwicks that were mortgaged to the
King of Prussia. The electorate of Hanover being now
secured from danger, sixteen thousand troops of that coun∣try,
together with the six thousand auxiliary Hessians,
began their march for the Netherlands; and about the
middle of October arrived in the neighbourhood of Brussels,
where they encamped. The Earl of Stair repaired to
Ghent, where the British forces were quartered: a body
of Austrians was assembled; and though the season was
far advanced, he seemed determined upon some expedition:
but all of a sudden the troops were sent into winter-quarters.
The Austrians retired to Luxembourg: the
English and Hessians remained in Flanders; and the Ha∣noverians
marched into the country of Liege, without pay∣ing
any regard to the Bishop's protestation.</P>
<P>§ XXXIX. The States-General had made a considerable
augmentation of their forces by sea and land; but, not∣withstanding
the repeated instances of the Earl of Stair,
they resolved to adhere to their neutrality: they dreaded
the neighbourhood of the French; and they were far from
being pleased to see the English get footing in the Nether∣lands.
The friends of the House of Orange began to exert
themselves: the states of Groningen and West-Friesland
protested, in favour of the Prince, against the promotion
of foreign generals which had lately been made: but his
<PB N="83" REF="87"/>
interest was powerfully opposed by the provinces of Zea∣land
and Holland, which had the greatest weight in the
republick. The revolution in Russia did not put an end
to the war with Sweden. These two powers had agreed
to an armistice of three months, during which the Czarina
augmented her forces in Finland. She likewise ordered
the Counts Osterman and Munich, with their adherents,
to be tried: they were condemned to death, but pardoned
on the scaffold, and sent in exile to Siberia. The Swedes,
still encouraged by the intrigues of France, refused to listen
to any terms of accommodation, unless Carelia, and the
other conquests of the Czar Peter, should be restored. The
French court had expected to bring over the new empress
to their measures: but they found her as well disposed as
her predecessor to assist the house of Austria. She remitted
a considerable sum of money to the Queen of Hungary;
and at the same time congratulated the Elector of Bavaria
on his elevation to the imperial throne. The ceremony
of her coronation was performed in May, with great
solemnity, at Moscow; and in November, she declared
her nephew, the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, her successor,
by the title of Grand Prince of all the Russias. The cessa∣tion
of arms being expired, General Las<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y reduced Fre∣dericksheim,
and obliged the Swedish army, commanded
by Count Lewenhaupt, to retire before him, from one place
to another, until at length they were quite surrounded
near Helsingfors. In this emergency, the Swedish general
submitted to a capitulation, by which his infantry were
transported by sea to Sweden; his cavalry marched by land
to Abo; and his artillery and magazines remained in the
hands of the Russians. The King of Sweden being of an
advanced age, the diet assembled in order to settle the
succession; and the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, as grandson
to the eldest sister to Charles XII. was declared next heir
to the crown. A courier was immediately dispatched to
Moscow, to notify to the Duke this determination of the
diet; and this message was followed by a deputation: but
when they understood that he had embraced the religion
<PB N="84" REF="88"/>
of the Greek church, and been acknowledged successor to
the throne of Russia, they annulled his election for Sweden,
and resolved that the succession should not be re-established,
until a peace should be concluded with the Czarina. Con∣ferences
were opened at Abo for this purpose. In the
mean time, the events of war had been so long unfortunate
for Sweden, that it was absolutely necessary to appease the
indignation of the people with some sacrifice. The Gene∣rals
Lewenhaupt and Bodenbrock were tried by a court∣martial
for misconduct: being found guilty and condemned
to death, they appealed to the diet, by which the sentence
was confirmed. The term of the subsidy-treaty between
Great Britain and Denmark expiring, his Danish Majesty
refused to renew it; nor would he accede to the peace of
Breslae. On the other hand, he became subsidiary to
France, with which also he concluded a new treaty of
commerce.</P>
<P>§ XXX. The Court of Versailles were now heartily
tired of maintaining the war in Germany, and actu∣ally
made equitable proposals of peace to the Queen of Hun∣gary,
by whom they were rejected. Thus repulsed, they
redoubled their preparations, and endeavoured, by advan∣tageous
offers, to detach the King of Sardinia from the in∣terest
of the House of Austria. This prince had espoused
a sister of the Grand Duke, who pressed him to declare
for her brother, and the Queen of Hungary promised to
gratify him with some territories in the Milanese;
besides, he thought the Spaniards had already gained too
much ground in Italy: but, at the same time, he was
afraid of being crushed between France and Spain, before
he could be properly supported. He, therefore, temporised,
and protracted the negociation, until he was alarmed at
the progress of the Spanish arms in Italy, and fixed in his
determination by the subsidies of Great-Britain. The
Spanish army assembled at Rimini, under the Duke de
Montemar; and being joined by the Neapolitan forces,
amounted to sixty thousand men, furnished with a large
train of artillery. About the beginning of May, they
<PB N="85" REF="89"/>
entered the Bolognese: then the King of Sardinia declar∣ing
against them, joined the Austrian army commanded
by Count Traun; marched into the duchy of Parma;
and understanding that the Duke of Modena had engaged
in a treaty with the Spaniards, dispossessed that Prince of
his dominions. The Duke de Montemar, seeing his army
diminished by sickness and desertion, retreated to the king∣dom
of Naples, and was followed by the King of Sardinia,
as far as Rimini.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. Here he received intelligence, that Don Philip,
third son of his Catholick Majesty, had made an irruption
into Savoy with another army of Spaniards, and already
taken possession of Chamberri, the capital. He forthwith
began his march for Piedmont. Don Philip abandoned
Savoy at his approach, and retreating into Dauphine,
took post under the cannon of fort Barreaux. The King
pursued him thither, and both armies remained in sight
of each other till the month of December, when the Mar∣quis
de Minas, an active and enterprising general, arrived
from Madrid, and took upon him the command of the
forces under Don Philip. This general's first exploit
was against the castle of Aspremont, in the neighbourhood
of the Sardinian camp. He attacked it so vigorously that
the garrison was obliged to capitulate in four and forty
hours. The loss of this important post compelled the
King to retire into Piedmont, and the Spaniards marched
back into Savoy, where they established their winter-quarters.
In the mean time, the Duke de Montemar,
who directed the other Spanish army, though the Duke of
Modena was nominal generalissimo, resigned his command
to Count Gages, who attempted to penetrate into Tusca∣ny;
but was prevented by the vigilance of Count Traun,
the Austrian general. In December he quartered his troops
in the Bolognese and Romagna; while the Austrians and
Piedmontese were distributed in the Modernese and Par∣mesan.
The Pope was passive during the whole cam∣paign:
the Venetians maintained their neutrality and
the King of the two Sicilies was over-awed by the British
fleet in the Mediterranean.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="90"/>
§ XXXII. The new ministry in England had sent out
Admiral Matthews to assume the command of this squadron,
which had been for some time conducted by Lestock, an
inferior officer, as Haddock had been obliged to resign his
commission, on account of his ill state of health. Mat∣thews
was likewise invested with the character of minister-plenipotentiary
to the King of Sardinia and the states of
Italy. Immediately after he had taken possession of his
command, he ordered Captain Norris to destroy five Spa∣nish
gallies which had put into the bay of St. Tropez;
and this service was effectually performed. In May he
detached Commodore Rowley, with eight sail, to cruise
off the harbour of Toulon; and a great number of mer∣chant
ships belonging to the enemy fell into his hands.
In August he sent Commodore Martin with another squa∣dron
into the bay of Naples, to bombard that city, unless
his Sicilian Majesty would immediately recall his troops,
which had joined the Spanish army, and promise to remain
neuter during the continuance of the war. Naples was
immediately filled with consternation: the King subscribed
to these conditions; and the English squadron rejoined the
admiral in the road of Hieres, which he had chosen for his
winter station. Before this period he had landed some
men at St. Remo, in the territories of Genoa, and destroy∣ed
the magazines that were erected for the use of the Spa∣nish
army. He had likewise ordered two of his cruisers to
attack a Spanish ship of the line which lay at anchor in
the port of Ajaccio, in the island of Corsica: but the Spa∣nish
captain set his men on shore, and blew up his ship,
rather than he should fall into the hands of the English.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. In the course of this year Admiral Vernon
and General Wentworth made another effort in the West-Indies.
They had in January received a re-enforcement
from England, and planned a new expedition, in concert
with the governor of Jamaica, who accompanied them in
the voyage. Their design was to disembark the troops at
Porto-Bello; and march across the isthmus of Darien, to
attack the rich town of Panama: They sailed from
<PB N="87" REF="91"/>
Jamaica on the ninth day of March, and on the twenty-eighth
arrived at Porto-Bello. There they held a council
of war, in which it was resolved, that as the troops were
sickly, the rainy season begun, and several transports not
yet arrived, the intended expedition was become impracti∣cable.
In pursuance of this determination the armament
immediately returned to Jamaica, exhibiting a ridiculous
spectacle of folly and irresolution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In May two English frigates, commanded by Captain Smith and Captain Stuart, fell in with three Spanish ships of war, near the island of St. Chri∣stopher's. They forthwith engaged, and the action continued till night, by the favour of which the enemy retired to Porto-Rico in a shattered condition.</P>
<P>In the month of September the Tilbury ship of war, of sixty-guns, was accidentally set on fire, and destroyed, off the island of Hispaniola: on which occasion one hundred and twenty seven men perished; the rest were saved by Capt. Hoare of the Desiance, who happened to be on the same cruise.</P></NOTE>. In August a ship of
war was sent from thence, with about three hundred
soldiers, to the small island Rattan, in the bay of Honduras,
of which they took possession. In September Vernon and
Wentworth received orders to return to England with such
troops as remained alive: these did not amount to a tenth
part of the number which had been sent abroad in that in∣glorious
service. The inferior officers fell ignobly by
sickness and despair, without an opportunity of signalizing
their courage, and the commanders lived to feel the scorn
and reproach of their country. In the month of June the
new colony of Georgia was invaded by an armament from
St. Augustine, commanded by Don Marinel de Montea∣no,
governor of that fortress. It consisted of six-and-thir∣ty
ships, from which four thousand men were landed at St.
Simon's; and began their march for Frederica. General
Oglethorpe, with a handful of men, took such wise pre∣cautions
for opposing their progress, and harrassed them in
their march with such activity and resolution, that after
two of their detachments had been defeated, they retired
to their ships, and totally abandoned the enterprise.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. In England the merchants still com∣plained
that their commerce was not properly protected,
and the people clamoured against the conduct of the war.
<PB N="88" REF="92"/>
They said their burthens were increased to maintain quarrels
with which they had no concern; to defray the enormous
expense of inactive fleets and pacific armies. Lord C. had
by this time insinuated himself into the confidence of
his sovereign, and engrossed the whole direction of pub∣lick
affairs. The war with Spain was now become a se∣condary
consideration, and neglected accordingly; while
the chief attention of the new minister was turned
upon the affairs of the continent. The dispute with Spain
concerned Britain only. The interests of Hanover were
connected with the troubles of the empire. By pursuing
this object he soothed the wishes of his master, and
opened a more ample field for his own ambition. He had
studied the policy of the continent with peculiar eagerness.
This was the favourite subject of his reflexion, upon which
he thought and spoke with a degree of enthusiasm. The
intolerable taxes, the poverty, the ruined commerce
of his country, the iniquity of standing armies, votes of
credit, and foreign connections, upon which he had so
often expatiated, were now forgotten, or overlooked.
He saw nothing but glory, conquest, and acquired do∣minion.
He set the power of France at desiance; and,
as if Great-Britain had felt no distress, but teemed with
treasure which she could not otherwise employ, he poured
forth her millions with a rash and desperate hand, in
purchasing beggarly allies, and maintaining mercenary ar∣mies.
The Earl of Stair had arrived in England towards
the end of August, and conferred with his Majesty. A
privy-council was summoned; and in a few days that
nobleman returned to Holland. Lord Carteret was sent
with a commission to the Hague in September; and when
he returned, the baggage of the King and the Duke of
Cumberland, which had been shipped for Flanders, was
ordered to be brought on shore. The parliament met
on the sixteenth day of November, when his Majesty told
them, that he had augmented the British forces in the
Low-Countries with sixteen thousand Hanoverians and
the Hessian auxiliaries, in order to form such a force, in
<PB N="89" REF="93"/>
conjunction with the Austrian troops, as might be of
service to the common cause at all events. He extolled
the magnanimity and fortitude of the Queen of Hungary,
as well as the resolute conduct of the King of Sardinia,
and that prince's strict adherence to his engagements,
though attacked in his own dominions. He mentioned
the requisition made by Sweden, of his good offices for
procuring a peace between that nation and Russia; the
defensive alliances which he had concluded with the Cza∣rina,
and with the King of Prussia, as events which could
not have been expected, if Great-Britain had not mani∣fested
a seasonable spirit and vigour, in defence and assist∣ance
of her ancient allies, and in maintaining the liber∣ties
of Europe. He said, the honour and interest of his
crown and kingdoms, the success of the war with Spain,
the re-establishment of the balance and tranquillity of
Europe would greatly depend on the prudence and vigour
of their resolutions. The Marquis of Tweedale moved
for an address of thanks, which was opposed by the Earl
of Chesterfield, for the reasons so often urged on the same
occasion; but supported by Lord C. on his new-adopted
maxims, with those specious arguments which he could
at all times produce, delivered with amazing serenity and
assurance. The motion was agreed to, and the address
presented to his Majesty. About this period a treaty of
mutual defence and guarantee between his Majesty and
the King of Prussia was signed at Westminster. In the
House of Commons Mr. Lyttelton made a motion for re∣viving
the place-bill; but it was opposed by a great num∣ber
of members who had formerly been strenuous ad∣vocates
for this measure, and rejected upon a division.
This was also the fate of a motion made to renew the en∣quiry
into the conduct of Robert Earl of Orford. As
many strong presumptions of guilt had appeared against
him in the reports of the secret committee, the na∣tion
had reason to expect that this proposal would have
been embraced by a great majority: but several members,
who in the preceding session had been loud in their de∣mands
<PB N="90" REF="94"/>
of justice, now shamefully contributed their ta∣lents
and interest in stifling the enquiry.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. When the House of Lords took into consi∣deration
the several estimates of the expense occasioned
by the forces in the pay of Great-Britain, Earl Stanhope,
at the close of an elegant speech, moved for an address, to
beseech and advise his Majesty, that, in compassion to his
people, loaded already with such numerous and heavy
taxes, such large and growing debts, and greater annual
expenses than the nation at any time before had ever
sustained, he would exonerate his subjects of the charge
and burden of those mercenaries who were taken into the
service last year, without the advice or consent of par∣liament.
The motion was supported by the Earl of
Sandwich, who took occasion to speak with great con∣tempt
of Hanover, and in mentioning the royal family,
seemed to forget that decorum which the subject required.
He had, indeed, reason to talk with asperity on the con∣tract
by which the Hanoverians had been taken into the
pay of Great-Britain. Levy-money was charged to the
account, though they were engaged for one year only;
and though not a single regiment had been raised on this
occasion: they had been levied for the security of the
electorate; and would have been maintained if England
had never engaged in the affairs of the continent. The
Duke of Bedford enlarged upon the same subject. He
said it had been suspected, nor was the suspicion without
foundation, that the measures of the English ministry had
long been regulated by the interest of his Majesty's elec∣toral
territories: that these had been long considered as a
gulf into which the treasures of Great-Britain had been
thrown: that the state of Hanover had been changed
without any visible cause, since the accession of its
princes to the throne of England: affluence had begun to
wanton in their towns, and gold to glitter in their cot∣tages,
without the discovery of mines, or the increase of
their commerce; and new dominions had been purchased,
of which the value was never paid from the revenues of
<PB N="91" REF="95"/>
Hanover▪ The motion was hunted down by the new
minister, the patriot Lord Bathurst, and the Earl of
Bath, which last nobleman declared, that he considered
it as an act of cowardice and meanness, to fall passive∣ly
down the stream of popularity, to suffer his reason and
integrity to be overborn by the noise of vulgar clamours,
which had been raised against the measures of government
by the low arts of exaggeration, fallacious reasonings,
and partial representations. This is the very language
which Sir Robert Walpole had often used against Mr.
Pulteney and his confederates in the House of Commons.
The associates of the new secretary pleaded the cause of
Hanover, and insisted upon the necessity of a land war
against France, with all the vehemence of declamation.
Their suggestions were answered; their conduct was se∣verely
stigmatized by the Earl of Chesterfield, who ob∣served,
that the assembling an army in Flanders, without
the concurrence of the States-General, or any other
power engaged by treaty, or bound by interest, to sup∣port
the Queen of Hungary, was a rash and ridiculous
measure: the taking sixteen thousand Hanoverians into
British pay, without consulting the parliament, seemed
highly derogatory to the rights and dignity of the great
council of the nation, and a very dangerous precedent to
future times: that these troops could not be employed
against the Emperor, whom they had already recognized:
that the arms and wealth of Britain alone were altogether
insufficient to raise the house of Austria to its former
strength, dominion, and influence: that the assembling
an army in Flanders would engage the nation as princi∣pals
in an expensive and ruinous war, with a power
which it ought not to provoke, and could not pretend
to withstand in that manner: that while Great-Britain
exhausted herself almost to ruin, in pursuance of schemes
founded on engagements to the Queen of Hungary, the
electorate of Hanover, though under the same engage∣ments,
and governed by the same prince, did not appear
to contribute any thing as an ally to her assistance, but
was paid by Great-Britain for all the forces it had sent into
<PB N="92" REF="96"/>
the field, at a very exorbitant price: that nothing could
be more absurd and iniquitous than to hire these merce∣naries,
while a numerous army lay inactive at home;
and the nation groaned under such intolerable burthens
“It may be proper (added he) to repeat what may be
forgotten in the multitude of other objects, that this
nation, after having exalted the Elector of Hanover
from a state of obscurity to the crown, is condemned
to hire the troops of that electorate to fight their own
cause; to hire them at a rate which was never demanded
before; and to pay levy-money for them, though it
is known to all Europe that they were not raised for
this occasion.” All the partisans of the old mi∣nistry
joined in the opposition to Earl Stanhope's mo∣tion,
which was rejected by the majority. Then the
Earl of Scarborough moved for an address, to approve of
the measures which had been taken on the continent; and
this was likewise carried by dint of number. It was not,
however, a very eligible victory: what they gained in
parliament they lost with the people. The new mini∣sters
became more odious than their predecessors; and
people began to think that publick virtue was an empty
name.</P>
<P>§ XXXVI. But the most severe opposition they under∣went
was in their endeavours to support a bill which they
had concerted, and which had passed through the House
of Commons with great precipitation: it repealed certain
duties on spirituous liquors; and licenses for retail∣ing
these liquors; and imposed others at an easier
rate. When those severe duties, amounting almost to a
prohibition, were imposed, the populace of London were
sunk into the most brutal degeneracy, by drinking to
excess the pernicious spirit called Gin, which was sold so
cheap, that the lowest class of the people could afford to in∣dulge
themselves in one continued state of intoxication,
to the destruction of all morals, industry, and order.
Such a shameful degree of profligacy prevailed, that the
retailers of this poisonous compound set up painted boards
in publick, inviting people to be drunk for the small ex∣pense
<PB N="93" REF="97"/>
of one penny; assuring them they might be dead
drunk for two-pence, and have straw for nothing. They
accordingly provided cellars and places strewed with straw,
to which they conveyed those wretches who were over∣whelmed
with intoxication. In these dismal caverns they
lay until they recovered some use of their faculties, and
then they had recourse to the same mischievous po∣tion;
thus consuming their health, and ruining their
families in hideous receptacles of the most filthy vice,
resounding with riot, execration, and blasphemy. Such
beastly practices too plainly denoted a total want of all
police and civil regulation, and would have reflected dis∣grace
upon the most barbarous community. In order to
restrain this evil, which was become intolerable, the legi∣slature
enacted that law which we have already mentioned.
But the populace soon broke through all restraint. Though
no licence was obtained, and no duty paid, the liquor
continued to be sold in all corners of the streets: inform∣ers
were intimidated by the threats of the people; and
the justices of the peace, either from indolence or cor∣ruption,
neglected to put the law in execution. The
new ministers foresaw that a great revenue would
accrue to the crown from a repeal of this act; and this
measure they thought they might the more decently take,
as the law had proved ineffectual: for it appeared that
the consumption of gin had considerably increased every
year since those heavy duties were imposed. They, there∣fore,
pretended, that should the price of the liquor be
moderately raised, and licences granted at twenty shil∣lings
each to the retailers, the lowest class of people
would be debarred the use of it to excess: their morals
would of consequence be mended; and a considerable
sum of money might be raised for the support of the war,
by mortaging the revenue arising from the duty and the
licences. Upon these maxims the new bill was founded,
and passed through the Lower House without opposition:
but among the Peers it produced the most obstinate dis∣pute
which had happened since the beginning of this par∣liament.
<PB N="94" REF="98"/>
The first assault it sustained was from Lord
Hervey, who had been divested of his post of privy-seal,
which was bestowed on Lord Gower; and these two no∣blemen
exchanged principles from that instant. The first
was hardened into a sturdy patriot; the other suppled into
an obsequious courtier. Lord Hervey, on this occasion,
made a florid harangue upon the pernicious effects of
that destructive spirit they were about to let loose upon
their fellow-creatures. Several prelates expatiated on the
same topicks: but the Earl of Chesterfield attacked the
bill with the united powers of reason, wit, and ridicule.
Lord Carteret, Lord Bathurst, and the Earl of Bath
were numbered among its advocates; and shrewd argu∣ments
were advanced on both sides of the question. After
very long, warm, and repeated debates, the bill passed
without amendments, though the whole bench of bishops
voted against it; and we cannot help owning, that it has
not been attended with those dismal consequences which
the lords in the opposition foretold. When the question
was put for committing this bill, and the Earl of Chester∣field
saw the bishops join in his division, “I am in doubt
(said he) whether I have not got on the other side of
the question; for I have not had the honour to divide
with so many lawn sleeves for several years.”</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. By the report of the secret committee it
appeared that the then minister had commenced prosecu∣tions
against the mayors of boroughs who opposed his
influence in the elections of members of parliament.
These prosecutions were founded on ambiguities in char∣ters,
or trival informalities in the choice of magistrates.
An appeal on such a process was brought into the House
of Lords; and this evil falling under consideration, a
bill was prepared for securing the independency of cor∣porations:
but as it tended to diminish the influence of
the ministry, they argued against it with their usual eager∣ness
and success: and it was rejected on a division. The
mutiny-bill and several others passed through both Houses.
The Commons granted supplies to the amount of six
<PB N="95" REF="99"/>
millions, raised by the land tax, the malt tax, duties on
spirituous liquors, and licences, and a loan from the sink∣ing-fund.
In two years the national debt had suffered an
increase of two millions four hundred thousand pounds.
On the twenty-first day of April the session was closed in
the usual manner.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1743</NOTE> The King, in his speech to both Houses,
told them, that, at the requisition of the Queen of Hun∣gary,
he had ordered his army, in conjunction with the
Austrians, to pass the Rhine for her support and assistance:
that he continued one squadron of ships in the Mediterra∣nean,
and another in the West-Indies. He thanked the
Commons for the ample supplies they had granted; and
declared it was the fixed purpose of his heart to promote
the true interest and happiness of his kingdoms. Imme∣diately
after the prorogation of parliament he embarked for
Germany, accompanied by the Duke of Cumberland, Lord
Carteret, and other persons of distinction.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. At this period the Queen of Hungary
seemed to triumph over all her enemies. The French
were driven out of Bohemia and part of the Upper-Pala∣tinate;
and their forces under Mareschal Broglio were
posted on the Danube. Prince Charles of Lorraine, at the
head of the Austrian army entered Bavaria; and in April
obtained a victory over a body of Bavarians at Braunau:
at the same time, three bodies of Croatians penetrating
through the passes of the Tyroleze, ravaged the open coun∣try
to the very gates of Munich. The Emperor pressed
the French general to hazard a battle; but he refused to
run this risque, though he had received a strong re-enforce∣ment
from France. His Imperial Majesty, thinking him∣self
unsafe in Munich, retired to Augusburgh: Mareschal
Seckendorf retreated with the Bavarian troops to Ingold∣stadt,
where he was afterwards joined by Mareschal Broglio,
whose troops had in this retreat been pursued and terribly
harrassed by the Austrian cavalry and hussars. Prince
Charles had opened a free communication with Munich,
which now for the third time fell into the hands of the
Queen of Hungary. Her arms likewise reduced Friedberg
<PB N="96" REF="100"/>
and Landsperg; while Prince Charles continued to pursu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
the French to Donawert, where they were joined by twelve
thousand men from the Rhine. Broglio still avoided an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
engagement, and retreated before the enemy to Hailbron
The Emperor being thus abandoned by his allies, and
stripped of all his dominions, repaired to Franckfort, where
he lived in indigence and obscurity. He now made ad∣vances
towards an accommodation with the Queen of
Hungary. His general, Seckendorf, had an interview
with Count Khevenhuller at the convent of Lowerscon∣field,
where a convention was signed. This treaty im∣ported,
That the Emperor should remain neuter during the
continuance of the present war; and That his troop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
should be quartered in Franconia: That the Queen of
Hungary should keep possession of Bavaria till the peace▪
That Braunau and Scharding should be delivered up to
the Austrians: That the French garrison of Ingoldstad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
should be permitted to withdraw, and be replaced by
Bavarians; but that the Austrian generals should be put
in possession of all the artillery, magazines, and warlike
stores belonging to the French, which should be found it
the place. The government of Egra and Ingoldstadt re∣fusing
to acquiesce in the capitulation, the Austrians had
recourse to the operations of war; and both places were
reduced. In Ingoldstadt they found all the Emperor
domestick treasure, jewels, plate, pictures, cabinets, and
curiosities, with the archives of the house of Bavaria, the
most valuable effects belonging to the nobility of that
electorate, a prodigious train of artillery, and a vast quan∣tity
of provisions, arms, and ammunition.</P>
<P>§ XXXIX. The French King, baffled in all the esso<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
he had hitherto made for the support of the Emperor,
ordered his minister at Franckfort to deliver a declaration
to the diet, professing himself extremely well pleased to
hear they intended to interpose their mediation for termi∣nating
the war. He said, he was no less satisfied with the
treaty of neutrality which the Emperor had concluded
with the Queen of Hungary; an event of which he was
<PB N="97" REF="101"/>
no sooner informed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VII. 1743.</NOTE> than he had ordered his troops to return
to the frontiers of his dominions, that the Germanick body
might be convinced of his equity and moderation. To
this declaration the Queen of Hungary answered in a re∣script,
that the design of France was to embarrass her affairs,
and deprive her of the assistance of her allies: that the
Elector of Bavaria could not be considered as a neutral
party in his own cause: that the mediation of the empire
could only produce a peace either with or without the con∣currence
of France: that in the former case no solid peace
could be expected; in the latter, it was easy to foresee, that
France would pay no regard to a peace in which she
should have no concern. She affirmed, that the aim of the
French King was solely to gain time to repair his losses,
that he might afterwards revive the troubles of the empire.
The Elector of Mentz, who had favoured the Emperor,
was now dead, and his successor inclined to the Austrian
interest. He allowed this rescript to be entered in the
journal of the diet, together with the protests which had
been made when the vote of Bohemia was suppressed in
the late election. The Emperor complained in a circular
letter of this transaction, as a stroke levelled at his Imperial
dignity; and it gave rise to a warm dispute among the
members of the Germanick body. Several princes resented
the haughty conduct, and began to be alarmed at the suc∣cess
of the house of Austria; while others pitied the de∣plorable
situation of the Emperor. The King of Great-Britain
and Prussia, as Electors of Hanover and Branden∣burgh,
espoused opposite sides in this contest. His Prussian
Majesty protested against the investiture of the duchy of
Saxe-Lawenburgh, claimed by the King of Great Britain:
he had an interview with General Seckendorf at Anspach;
and was said to have privately visited the Emperor at
Franckfort.</P>
<P>§ XL. The troops which the King of Great-Britain
had assembled in the Netherlands began their march for
the Rhine in the latter end of February; and in May they
encamped near Hoech on the river Mayne, under the com∣mand
<PB N="98" REF="102"/>
of the Earl of Stair.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK. II. 1743.</NOTE> This nobleman sent Major-General
Bland to Franckfort, with a compliment to the
Emperor, assuring him, in the name of his Britannic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k
Majesty, that the respect owing to his dignity should not
be violated, nor the place of his residence disturbed. Not∣withstanding
this assurance, the Emperor retired to Munich,
though he was afterwards compelled to return, by the suc∣cess
of the Austrians in Bavaria. The French King, in
order to prevent the junction of the British forces with
Prince Charles of Lorraine, ordered the Mareschal de
Noailles to assemble sixty thousand men upon the Mayne;
while Coigny was sent into Alsace with a numerous army,
to defend that province, and oppose Prince Charles, should
he attempt to pass the Rhine. The Mareschal de Noailles,
having secured the towns of Spire, Worms, and Oppen∣heim,
passed the Rhine in the beginning of June, and
posted himself on the east side of that river, above Franck∣fort.
The Earl of Stair advanced towards him, and en∣camped
at Killenbach, between the river Mayne and the
forest of D' Armstate: from this situation he made a mo∣tion
to Aschaffenburgh, with a view to secure the naviga∣tion
of the Upper Mayne: but he was anticipated by the
enemy, who lay on the other side of the river, and had
taken possession of the posts above, so as to intercept al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
supplies. They were posted on the other side of the river
opposite to the allies, whose camp they overlooked; an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
they found means, by their parties and other precautions
to cut off the communication by water between Franck∣fort
and the confederates. The Duke of Cumberland ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
already come to make his first campaign, and his Majesty
arrived in the camp on the ninth day of June. He foun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his army, amounting to about forty thousand men, in dange<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of starving: he received intelligence, that a re-enforcemens
of twelve thousand Hanoverians and Hessians had reache<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Hanau; and he resolved to march thither, both with a view
to effect the junction, and to procure provision for hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
forces. With this view he decamped on the twenty-sixt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
day of June. He had no sooner quitted Aschaffenburgh
<PB N="99" REF="103"/>
than it was seised by the French general: he had not
marched above three leagues, when he perceived the ene∣my,
to the number of thirty thousand, had passed the river
farther down, at Selingenstadt, and were drawn up in order
of battle at the village of Dettingen, to dispute his passage.
Thus he found himself cooped up in a very dangerous
situation. The enemy had possessed themselves of Aschaf∣fenburgh
behind, so as to prevent his retreat, his troops
were confined in a narrow plain, bounded by hills and
woods on the right, flanked on the left by the river Mayne,
on the opposite side of which the French had erected bat∣teries
that annoyed the allies on their march: in the front
a considerable part of the French army was drawn up,
with a narrow pass before them, the village of Dettingen
on their right, a wood on their left, and a morass in the
centre. Thus environed, the confederates must either
have fought at a very great disadvantage, or surrendered
themselves prisoners of war, had not the Duke de Gramont,
who commanded the enemy, been instigated by the spirit of
madness to forego these advantages. He passed the defile,
and advancing towards the allies, a battle ensued. The
French horse charged with great impetuosity, and some
regiments of British cavalry were put in disorder: but the
infantry of the allies behaved with such intrepidity and de∣liberation,
under the eye of their sovereign, as soon deter∣mined
the fate of the day: the French were obliged to give
way, and repass the Mayne with great precipitation, hav∣ing
lost about five thousand men killed, wounded, or taken.
Had they been properly pursued before they recollected
themselves from their first confusion, in all probability they
would have sustained a total overthrow. The Earl of
Stair proposed that a body of cavalry should be detached
on this service; but his advice was over-ruled. The loss
of the allies in this action amounted to two thousand men.
The Generals Clayton and Monroy were killed: the Duke
of Cumberland, who exhibited uncommon proofs of cou∣rage,
was shot through the calf of the leg: the Earl of
Albemarle, General Huske, and several other officers of

distinction, were wounded. The King exposed his perso<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to a severe fire of cannon as well as musquetry: he rod<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
between the first and second lines with his sword drawn
and encouraged the troops to fight for the honour o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
England. Immediately after the action he continued hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
march to Hanau, where he was joined by the re-enforce∣ment.
The Earl of Stair sent a trumpet to Mareschal <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Noailles, recommending to his protection the sick an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

the French general treated with great care and tenderness
Such generosity softens the rigours of war, and does honou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to humanity.</P>
<P>§ XLI. The two armies continued on different sides o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the river till the twelfth day of July, when the French
general receiving intelligence that Prince Charles of Lor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raine
had approached the Neckar, he suddenly retired, and
repassed the Rhine between Worms and Oppenheim<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
The King of Great-Britain was visited by Prince Charles
and Count Khevenhuller at Hanau, where the future ope∣rations
of the campaign were regulated. On the twenty-seventh
day of August, the allied army passed the Rhine a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Mentz, and the King fixed his head-quarters in the episco∣pal
palace at Worms. Here the forces lay encamped til<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the latter end of September, when they advanced to Spire,
where they were joined by twenty thousand Dutch auxil∣iaries
from the Netherlands. Mereschal Noailles having
retreated into Upper Alsace, the allies took possession of
Germersheim, and demolished the entrenchments which
the enemy had raised on the Queich: then they returned
to Mentz, and in October were distributed into winter-quarters,
after an inactive campaign that redounded very
little to the honour of those by whom the motions of the
army were conducted. In September a treaty had been
concluded at Worms between his Britannick Majesty,
the King of Sardinia, and the Queen of Hungary. She
engaged to maintain thirty thousand men in Italy: the
King of Sardinia obliged himself to employ forty thousand
infantry and five thousand horse, in consideration of his
<PB N="101" REF="107"/>
commanding the combined army, and receiving an annual
subsidy of two hundred thousand pounds from Great-Britain.
As a further gratification, the Queen yielded to
him the city of Placentia, with several districts in the
duchy of Pavia, and in the Novarese; and all her right
and pretensions to Final, at present possessed by the
republick of Genoa, which, they hoped, would give it
up, on being repaid the purchase-money, amounting to
three hundred thousand pounds. This sum the King of
England promised to disburse; and moreover to maintain
a strong squadron in the Mediterranean, the commander
of which should act in concert with his Sardinian Majesty.
Finally, the contracting powers agreed, That Final should
be constituted a free-port, like that of Leghorn. Nothing
could be more unjust than this treaty, by which the
Genoese were negociated out of their property. They
had purchased the marquisate of Final of the late Emperor
for a valuable consideration, and the purchase had been
guaranteed by Great-Britain. It could not, therefore, be
expected that they would part with this acquisition to a
Prince whose power they thought already too formidable;
specially, on condition of its being made a free-port, to
the prejudice of their own commerce. They presented
remonstrances against this article, by their ministers at the
courts of London, Vienna, and Turin; and as very little
regard was paid to their representations, they threw them∣selves
into the arms of France and Spain for protection.</P>
<P>§ XLII. After the battle of Dettingen, Colonel Mentzel,
a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the head of a large body of irregulars belonging to the
Queen of Hungary, made an irruption into Lorraine,
part of which they ravaged without mercy. In September
Prince Charles, with the Austrian army, entered the Bris∣gaw,
and attempted to pass the Rhine; but Mareschal
Coigny had taken such precautions for guarding it on the
other side, that he was obliged to abandon his design, and
marching back into the Upper Palatinate, quartered his
troops in that country, and in Bavaria. By this time the
Earl of Stair had sollicited and obtained leave to resign his
<PB N="102" REF="108"/>
command. He had for some time thought himself ne∣glected;
and was unwilling that his reputation should suffer
on account of measures in which he had no concern. In
October the King of Great-Britain returned to Hanover,
and the army separated. The troops in British pay
marched back to the Netherlands, and the rest took the
route to their respective countries. The States-General
still wavered between their own immediate interest and
their desire to support the house of Austria. At length,
however, they supplied her with a subsidy, and ordered
twenty thousand men to march to her assistance, notwith∣standing
the intrigues of the Marquis de Fenelon, the
French ambassador at the Hague, and the declaration of
the King of Prussia, who disapproved of this measure, and
refused them a passage through his territories, to the Rhine.</P>
<P>§ XLIII. Sweden was filled with discontents, and divid∣ed
into factions. The Generals Bodenbrock and Lewen∣haupt
were beheaded, having been sacrificed as scape-goats
for the ministry. Some unsuccessful efforts by sea and
land were made against the Russians. At last the peace
of Abo was concluded; and the Duke of Holstein-Ut in,
uncle to the successor of the Russian throne, was chosen as
next heir to the crown of Sweden. A party had been
formed in favour of the Prince of Denmark; and the order
of the peasants actually elected him as successor. The de∣bates
in the college of nobles rose to a very dangerous degree
of animosity, and were appeased by an harangue in Swe∣dish
verse, which one of the senators pronounced. The
peasants yielded the point, and the succession was settled on
the Duke of Holstein. Denmark, instigated by French
coucils, began to make preparations of war against Swe∣den:
but, a body of Russian auxiliaries arriving in that
kingdom, under the command of General Keith, and the
Czarina declaring she would assist the Swedes with her
whole force, the King of Denmark thought proper to
disarm. It had been an old maxim of French policy to
embroil the courts of the North, that they might be to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
much employed at home to intermeddle in the affairs o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="103" REF="109"/>
Germany, while France was at war with the house of
Austria. The good understanding between the Czarina
and the Queen of Hungary was at this period destroyed,
in consequence of a conspiracy which had been formed by
some persons of distinction at the court of Petersburgh, for
removing the Empress Elisabeth, and recalling the
Princess Anne to the administration. This design being
discovered, the principal conspirators were corporally pu∣nished,
and sent in exile to Siberia. The Marquis de
Botta, the Austrian minister, who had resided at the court
of the Czarina, was suspected of having been concerned
in the plot; though the grounds of this suspicion did not
appear until after he was recalled and sent as ambassador to
the court of Berlin. The Empress demanded satisfaction
of the Queen of Hungary, who appointed commissioners
to enquire into his conduct, and he was acquitted: but
the Czarina was not at all satisfied of his innocence. In
February a defensive treaty of alliance was concluded be∣tween
this princess and the King of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>§ XLIV. By this time France was deprived of her
ablest minister, in the death of the Cardinal de Fleury,
who had for many years managed the affairs of that king∣dom.
He is said to have possessed a lively genius, and an
insinuating address; to have been regular in his deport∣ment,
and moderate in his disposition; but at the same
time he has been branded as deceitful, dissembling,
and vindictive. His scheme of politicks was altogether
pacifick: he endeavoured to accomplish his purposes by
raising and fomenting intrigues at foreign courts: he did
not seem to pay much regard to the military glory of
France; and he too much neglected the naval power of
that kingdom. Since Broglio was driven out of Germany,
the French court affected uncommon moderation. They
pretended that their troops had only acted as auxiliaries
while they remained in the empire: being, however, appre∣hensive
of an irruption into their own dominions, they
declared, that those troops were no longer to be considered
in that light, but as subjects acting in the service of France.
<PB N="104" REF="110"/>
The campaign in Italy proved unfavourable to the Spa∣niards.
In the beginning of February Count Gages, who
commanded the Spanish army in the Bolognese, amount∣ing
to four-and-twenty thousand men, passed the
Panaro, and advanced to Campo-Santo, where he
encountered the Imperial and Piedmontese forces, com∣manded
by the Counts Traun and Aspremont. The
strength of the two armies was nearly equal. The action
was obstinate and bloody, though indecisive. The Spa∣niards
lost about four thousand men, killed, wounded, or
taken. The damage sustained by the confederates was
not quite so great. Some cannon and colours were taken
on both sides; and each claimed the victory. Count Gages
repassed the Panaro; retreated suddenly from Bologna;
and marched to Rimini in the ecclesiastical state, where
he fortified his camp in an advantageous situation, after
having suffered severely by desertion. Count Traun re∣mained
inactive in the Modenese till September, when he
resigned his command to Prince Lobkowitz. This gene∣ral
entered the Bolognese in October, and then advanced
towards Count Gages, who, with his forces, now reduced
to seven thousand, retreated to Fano; but afterwards took
possession of Pesaro, and fortified all the passes of the river
Foglia. The season was far advanced before the Spanish
troops, commanded by Don Philip, in Savoy, entered upon
action. In all probability, the courts of Versailles and
Madrid carried on some private negociation with the King
of Sardinia. This expedient failing, Don Philip decamped
from Chamberri in the latter end of August, and defiling
through Dauphine towards Briancon, was joined by the
Prince of Conti, at the head of twenty thousand French
auxiliaries. Thus re-enforced, he attacked the Piedmon∣tese
lines at Chateau-Dauphine; but was repulsed in several
attempts, and obliged to retreat with considerable loss.
The French established their winter-quarters in Dauphine
and Provence; and the Spaniards maintained their foot∣ing
in Savoy.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="111"/>
§ XLV. The British fleet commanded by Admiral
Matthews over-awed all the states that bordered on the
Mediterranean. This officer, about the end of June,
understanding that fourteen xebecks, laden with artillery
and ammunition for the Spanish army, had arrived at
Genoa, sailed thither from the road of Hieres, and de∣manded
of the republick that they would either oblige
these vessels with the stores to quit their harbour, or se∣quester
their lading until a general peace should be esta∣blished.
After some dispute, it was agreed that the cannon
and stores should be deposited in the castle of Bonifacio,
situated on a rock at the south end of Corsica; and that
the xebecks should have leave to retire without molestation.
The Corsicans had some years before revolted, and shaken
off the dominion of the Genoese, under which their island
had remained for many centuries. They found themselves
oppressed, and resolved to assert their freedom. They con∣ferred
the sovereign authority on a German adventurer,
who was solemnly proclaimed, by the name of King
Theodore. He had supplied them with some arms and
ammunition, which he had brought from Tunis; and
amused them with promises of being assisted by foreign
powers in retrieving their independency: but as these pro∣mises
were not performed, they treated him so roughly,
that he had thought proper to quit the island, and they
submitted again to their old masters. The troubles of
Corsica were now revived. Theodore revisited his king∣dom,
and was recognized by the principal chiefs of the
island. He published a manifesto: he granted a general
pardon to all his subjects who should return to their obedi∣ence:
he pretended to be countenanced and supported
by the King of Great-Britain and the Queen of Hungary.
He was certainly thought a proper instrument to perplex
and harrass the Genoese, and supplied at this juncture with
a sum of money to purchase arms for the Corsicans: but
a change soon happened in the British ministry, and then
he was suffered to relapse into his original obscurity. Ad∣miral
Matthews, though he did not undertake any expe∣dition
<PB N="106" REF="112"/>
of importance against the maritime towns of Spain,
continued to assert the British empire at sea through the
whole extent of the Mediterranean. The Spanish army
under Don Philip was no sooner in motion, than the
English admiral ordered some troops and cannon to be
disembarked for the security of Villa-Franca. Some stores
having been landed at Civita-Vecchia, for the use of the
Spanish forces under Count Gages, Matthews interpreted
this transaction into a violation of the neutrality which the
Pope had professed; and sent thither a squadron to bom∣bard
the place. The city of Rome was filled with con∣sternation;
and the Pope had recourse to the good
offices of his Sardinian Majesty, in consequence of which
the English squadron was ordered to withdraw. The
captains of single cruising ships, by their activity and vigi∣lance,
wholly interrupted the commerce of Spain; canno∣naded
and burned some towns on the sea-side; and kept
the whole coast in continual alarm<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In May a dreadful plague broke out at Messina in Sicily.

<P>§ XLVI. In the West-Indies some unsuccessful efforts
were made by an English squadron, commanded by Com∣modore
Knowles. He attacked La Gueira on the coast o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Carraccas, in the month of February; but met with su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
a warm reception, that he was obliged to desist, and make
the best of his way for the Dutch island Curaçoa, where
he repaired the damage he had sustained. His ships being
refitted, he made another attempt upon Porto-Cavallo it
<PB N="107" REF="113"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pril, which like the former miscarried. Twelve hundred
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arines being landed in the neighbourhood of the place,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere seised with such a panick, that it was found necessary to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>embark them without delay. Then the commodore aban∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ned
the enterprise, and sailed back to his station at the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eward-Islands, without having added much to his re∣putation,
either as to conduct or resolution. On the con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nent
of America the operations of the war were very in∣considerable.
General Oglethorpe having received intelli∣gence,
that the Spaniards prepared for another invasion
from St. Augustine, assembled a body of Indians, as a re∣enforcement
to part of his own regiment, with the High∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anders
and rangers, and in the spring began his march,
in order to anticipate the enemy. He encamped for some
time in the neighbourhood of St. Augustine, by way of
defiance: but they did not think proper to hazard an en∣gagement;
and as he was in no condition to undertake a
siege, he returned to Georgia. In October the Princess
Louisa, youngest daughter of his Britannick-Majesty, was
married by proxy, at Hanover, to the Prince-Royal of
Denmark, who met her at Altena, and conducted her to
Copenhagen.</P>

<P>§ I. THE discontents of England were artfully in∣flamed
by antiministerial writers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VIII. 1743.</NOTE> who not only
exaggerated the burthens of the people, and drew frightful
pictures of the distress and misery which, they said, impend∣ed
over the nation, but also employed the arts of calumny
and misrepresentation, to excite a jealousy and national
quarrel between the English and Hanoverians. They af∣firmed,
that in the last campaign the British general had
been neglected and despised; while the councils of foreign
officers, greatly inferior to him in capacity, quality, and
reputation, had been followed, to the prejudice of the com∣mon
cause: that the British troops sustained daily in∣sults
from their own mercenaries, who were indulged
with particular marks of royal favour: that the so∣vereign
himself appeared at Dettingen in a Hanoverian
scarf; and that his electoral troops were of very little service
in that engagement. Though the most material of these
assertions were certainly false, they made a strong impres∣sion
on the minds of the people, already irritated by the
enormous expense of a continental war maintained for the
interest of Germany. When the parliament met in the
beginning of December, a motion was made in the House
of Peers, by the Earl of Sandwich, for an address, beseech∣ing
his Majesty to discontinue the Hanoverian troops in
British pay, in order to remove the popular discontent, and
stop the murmurs of the English troops abroad. He was
supported by the Duke of Bedford, the Earl of Chester∣field,
and all the leaders in the opposition, who did not
fail to enumerate, and insist upon all the circumstances we
have mentioned. They moreover observed, that better
troops might be hired at a smaller expense: that it would
be a vain and endless task to exhaust the national treasure,
in enriching a hungry and barren electorate: that the po∣pular
dissatisfaction against these mercenaries was so general,
<PB N="110" REF="116"/>
and raised to such violence, as nothing but their dismissio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
could appease: that if such hirelings should be thus con∣tinued
from year to year, they might at last become a bur∣then
entailed upon the nation, and be made subservient
under some ambitious prince, to purposes destructive <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
British liberty. These were the suggestions of spleen an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
animosity: for, granting the necessity of a land-war, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Hanoverians were the most natural allies and auxiliarie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
which Great-Britain could engage and employ. How in∣solent
soever some few individual generals of that electorat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
might have been in their private deportment, certain it is
their troops behaved with great sobriety, discipline, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
decorum; and in the day of battle did their duty with a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
much courage and alacrity as any body of men ever display∣ed
on the like occasion. The motion was rejected by th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
majority; but, when the term for keeping them in the
British pay was nearly expired, and the estimates for their
being continued the ensuing year were laid before the
House, the Earl of Sandwich renewed his motion. The
Lord-Chancellor, as speaker of the House, interposing, de∣clared,
that by their rules a question once rejected could
not be revived during the same session. A debate ensued,
and the second motion was over-ruled. The Hanoverian
troops were voted in the House of Commons: nevertheless,
the same nobleman moved in the Upper House, that the
continuing sixteen thousand Honoverians in British pay
was prejudicial to his Majesty's true interest, useless to the
common cause, and dangerous to the welfare and tranquil∣lity
of the nation. He was seconded by the Duke of
Marlborough, who had resigned his commission in disgust;
and the proposal gave birth to another warm dispute; but
victory declared, as usual, for the ministry.</P>
<P>§ II. In the House of Commons they sustained divers
attacks. A motion was made for laying a duty of eight
shillings in the pound on all places and pensions. Mr.
Grenville moved for an address, to beseech his Majesty,
that he would not engage the British nation any further
in the war on the continent, without the concurrence of
<PB N="111" REF="117"/>
the States-General on certain stipulated proportions of
force and expense, as in the late war. These proposals
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egat vigorous debates, in which the country-party were
always foiled by dint of superior number. Such was the
credit and influence of the ministry in parliament, that
although the national debt was increased by above six mil∣lions
since the commencement of the war, the Commons
indulged them with an enormous sum for the expense of
the ensuing year. The grants specified in the votes
amounted to six millions and an half; to this sum were
added three millions and an half paid to the sinking-fund
in perpetual taxes; so that this year's expense rose to ten
millions. The funds established for the annual charge
were the land and malt-taxes, one million paid by the
East-India company for the renewal of their charter,
twelve hundred thousand pounds by annuities, one million
from the sinking fund, six-and-thirty thousand pounds
from the coinage, and six hundred thousand pounds by a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ottery: an expedient which for some time had been an∣nually
repeated: and which, in a great measure, contri∣buted
to debauch the morals of the publick, by introdu∣cing
a spirit of gaming, destructive of all industry and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irtue.</P>
<P>§ III. The dissentions of the British parliament were
suddenly suspended by an event that seemed to unite both
parties in the prosecution of the same measures. This
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as the intelligence of an intended invasion. By the par∣liamentary
disputes, the loud clamours, and the general
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>issatisfaction of the people in Great-Britain, the French
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inistry were persuaded that the nation was ripe for a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>volt. This belief was corroborated by the assertions of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eir emissaries in different parts of Great-Britain and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eland. These were papists and Jacobites of strong pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dices
and warm imaginations, who saw things through
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e medium of passion and party, and spoke rather from
extravagant zeal than from sober conviction. They gave
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e court of Versailles to understand, that if the Cheva∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r
de St. George, or his eldest son, Charles-Edward,
<PB N="112" REF="118"/>
should appear at the head of a French army in Great-Britain,
a revolution would instantly follow in his favo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪.
This intimation was agreeable to Cardinal de Tenci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
who, since the death of Fleury, had bor'n a share in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
administration of France. He was of a violent enterpri∣sing
temper. He had been recommended to the purp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
by the Chevalier de St. George, and was seemingly at∣tached
to the Stuart family. His ambition was flattere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
with a prospect of giving a king to Great-Britain; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
performing such eminent services to his benefactor; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
restoring to the throne of their ancestors a family connect∣ed
by the ties of blood with all the greatest princes <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Europe. The ministry of France foresaw, that if even th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
aim should miscarry, a descent upon Great-Britain wou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
make a considerable diversion from the continent in favo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
of France, and embroil and embarrass his Britannick Ma∣jesty,
who was the chief support of the House of Austria, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
all its allies. Actuated by these motives, he concerted mea∣sures
with the Chevalier de St. George at Rome, who be∣ing
too much advanced in years to engage persona<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
in such an expedition, agreed to delegate his preten∣sions
and authority to his son Charles, a youth of prom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sing
talents, sage, secret, brave, and enterprising, amiable
in his person, grave, and even reserved in his deportment.
He approved himself in the sequel composed and mode∣rate
in success, wonderfully firm in adversity; and thoug<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
tenderly nursed in all the delights of an effeminate coun∣try,
and gentle climate, patient almost beyond belief <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
cold, hunger, and fatigue. Such was the adventur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
now destined to fill the hope which the French minist<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
had conceived from the projected invasion of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>§ IV. Count Saxe was appointed by the French Ki<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
commander of the troops designed for this expedition<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
which amounted to fifteen thousand men. They bega<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
their march to Picardy, and a great number of vesse<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was assembled for their embarkation at Dunkirk, Cala<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
and Boulogn. It was determined that they should be
<PB N="113" REF="119"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anded in Kent, under convoy of a strong squadron
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quipped at Brest, and commanded by Monsieur de Roque∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>euille,
an officer of experience and capacity. The Che∣valier
de St. George is said to have required the personal
service of the Duke of Ormond, who excused him∣self
on account of his advanced age: be that as it will,
Prince Charles departed from Rome about the end of
December, in the disguise of a Spanish courier, attended
by one servant only, and furnished with passports by
Cardinal Aquaviva. He travelled through Tuscany to
Genoa, from whence he proceded to Savona, where he
embarked for Antibes, and prosecuting his journey to
Paris, was indulged with a private audience of the French
King; then he set out incognito for the coast of Picardy.
The British ministry being apprised of his arrival in
France, at once comprehended the destination of the ar∣maments
prepared at Brest and Boulogn. Mr. Thomp∣son,
the English resident at Paris, received orders to make
a remonstrance to the French ministry, on the violation
of those treaties by which the pretender to the crown of
Great-Britain was excluded from the territories of France.
But he was given to understand, that his most Christian
Majesty would not explain himself on that subject, until
the King of England should have given satisfaction on
the repeated complaints which had been made to him,
touching the infractions of those very treaties which had
been so often violated by his orders. In the month of
January, M. de Roquefeuille sailed from Brest, directing
his course up the English channel, with twenty ships of
war. They were immediately discovered by an English
cruiser, which ran into Plymouth; and the intelligence
was conveyed by land to the board of Admiralty. Sir
John Norris was forthwith ordered to take the command
of the squadron at Spithead, with which he sailed round
to the Downs, where he was joined by some ships of the
line from Chatham, and then he sound himself at the
head of a squadron considerably stronger than that of the
enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="120"/>
§ V. Several regiments marched to the southern coast
of England: all governors and commanders were ordered
to repair immediately to their respective posts: the forts
at the mouths of the Thames and the Medway were put
in a posture of defence; and directions were issued to
assemble the Kentish militia, to defend the coast in case of
an invasion. On the fifteenth day of February, the King
sent a message to both Houses of parliament, intimating
the arrival of the Pretender's son in France, the prepara∣tions
at Dunkirk, and the appearance of a French fleet in
the English channel. They joined in an address, de∣claring
their indignation and abhorrence of the design
formed in favour of a popish pretender; and assuring his
Majesty, that they would, with the warmest zeal and
unanimity, take such measures as would enable him to
frustrate and defeat so desperate and insolent an attempt.
Addresses of the same kind were presented by the city of
London, both universities, the principal towns of Great-Britain,
the clergy, the dissenting ministers, the qua∣kers,
and almost all the corporations and communities of
the kingdom. A requisition was made of the six thousand
auxiliaries which the States-General were by treaty
obliged to furnish on such occasions; and these were
granted with great alacrity and expedition. The Earl of
Stair, forgetting his wrongs, took this opportunity of of∣fering
his services to government, and was re-invested
with the chief command of the forces in Great-Britain.
His example was followed by several noblemen of the first
rank. The Duke of Montague was permitted to raise a
regiment of horse; and orders were sent to bring over six
thousand of the British troops from Flanders, in case the
invasion should actually take place. His Majesty was, in
another address from parliament, exhorted to augment
his forces by sea and land: the Habeas Corpus act was
suspended for six months, and several persons of distinction
were apprehended on suspicion of treasonable practises:
a proclamation was issued for putting the laws in exe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u∣tion
against papists and nonjorors, who were commanded
<PB N="115" REF="121"/>
to retire ten miles from London; and every precaution
was taken which seemed necessary for the preservation of
the publick tranquillity.</P>
<P>§ VI. Mean while the French court proceeded with
their preparations at Boulogn and Dunkirk, under the
eye of the young Pretender; and seven thousand men were
actually embarked. M. de Roquefeuille sailed up the
channel as far as Dungeness, a promontory on the coast of
Kent, after having detached M. de Barreil, with five ships,
to hasten the embarkation at Dunkirk. While the French
admiral anchored off Dungeness, he perceived, on the
twenty-fourth day of February, the British fleet, under Sir
John Norris, doubling the South-Foreland from the
Downs; and though the wind was against him, taking
the opportunity of the tide to come up and engage the
French squadron. Roquefeuille, who little expected such
a visit, could not be altogether composed, considering the
great superiority of his enemies: but the tide failing, the
English admiral was obliged to anchor two leagues short
of the enemy. In this interval, M. Roquefeuille called a
council of war, in which it was determined to avoid an
engagement, weigh anchor at sunset, and make the best of
their way to the place from whence they had set sail. This
resolution was favoured by a very hard gale of wind, which
began to blow from the north-east, and carried them down
the channel with incredible expedition. But the same
storm which, in all probability, saved their fleet from de∣struction,
utterly disconcerted the design of invading
England. A great number of their transports was driven
ashore and destroyed, and the rest were so damaged that
they could not be speedily repaired. The English were
now masters at sea, and their coast was so well guarded,
that the enterprise could not be prosecuted with any pro∣bability
of success. The French generals nominated to
serve in this expedition returned to Paris, and the young
Pretender resolved to wait a more favourable opportunity.
In the mean time he remained in Paris, or that neigh∣bourhood,
incognito, and almost totally neglected by the
<PB N="116" REF="122"/>
court of France. Finding himself in this disagreeable
situation, and being visited by John Murray of Brough∣ton,
who magnified the power of his friends in Great-Britain,
he resolved to make some bold effort, even without
the assistance of Louis, in whose sincerity he had no faith,
and forthwith took proper measures to obtain exact infor∣mation
touching the number, inclinations, and influence
of his father's adherents in England and Scotland.
The French King no longer preserved any measures with
the court of London: the British resident at Paris was
given to understand, that a declaration of war must ensue;
and this was actually published on the twentieth day of
March. The King of Great-Britain was taxed with hav∣ing
dissuaded the court of Vienna from entertaining any
thoughts of an accommodation: with having infringed
the convention of Hanover; with having exercised piracy
upon the subjects of France, and with having blocked up
the harbour of Toulon. On the thirty-first day of
March, a like denunciation of war against France
was published at London, amidst the acclamation<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of the people.</P>
<P>§ VII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1744.</NOTE> The Commons of England, in order to evince
their loyalty, brought in a bill, denouncing the penalties
of high treason against those who should maintain corre∣spondence
with the sons of the Pretender. In the Upper
House, Lord Hardwicke, the Chancellor, moved, that a
clause should be inserted, extending the crime of treason
to the posterity of the offenders, during the lives of the
Pretender's sons. The motion, which was supported by
the whole strength of the ministry, produced a warm debate
in which the Duke of Bedford, the Earl of Chesterfield,
the Lords Talbot and Hervey, argued against it in the most
pathetick manner, as an illiberal expedient, contrary to
the dictates of humanity, the law of nature, the rules of
common justice, and the precepts of religion; and expedient
that would involve the innocent with the guilty, and tend
to the augmentation of ministerial power, for which pur∣pose
it was undoubtedly calculated. Notwithstanding
<PB N="117" REF="123"/>
these suggestions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VIII. 1744.</NOTE> the clause was carried in the affirmative,
and the bill sent back to the Commons, where the amend∣ment
was vigorously opposed by Lord Strange, Lord
Guernsey, Mr. W. Pitt, and other members, by whom
the original bill had been countenanced<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The opposition had sustained a heavy blow in the death of the Duke of Argyle, a nobleman of shining qualifications for the senate and the field, whose character would have been still more illustrious had not some parts of his conduct subjected him to the suspicion of selfishness and inconstancy. He was succeeded in that title by his brother, Archibald Earl of Ilay.</NOTE>: the majority,
however, declared for the amendment, and the bill ob∣tained
the royal assent. The session of parliament was
closed in May, when the King told them that the French
had made vast preparations on the side of the Nether∣lands;
and that the States-General had agreed to furnish
the succours stipulated by treaties.</P>
<P>§ VIII. By this time an action had happened in the
Mediterranean between the British fleet commanded by
Admiral Matthews, and the combined squadrons of France
and Spain, which had been for some time blocked up in
the harbour of Toulon. On the ninth day of February
they were perceived standing out of the road, to the
number of four-and-thirty sail: the English admiral im∣mediately
weighed from Hieres-bay; and on the eleventh,
part of the fleets engaged. Matthews attacked the Spanish
admiral, Don Navarro, whose ship, the Real, was a first
rate, mounted with above an hundred guns. Rear-Ad∣miral
Rowley singled out M. de Court, who commanded
the French squadron; and a very few captains followed
the example of their commanders: but Vice-Admiral Les∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ock,
with his whole division, remained at a great distance
astern; and several captains who were immediately under
the eye of Matthews behaved in such a manner as reflected
disgrace upon their country. The whole transaction was
conducted without order or deliberation. The French
and Spaniards would have willingly avoided an engage∣ment,
as the British squadron was superior to them in
strength and number. M. de Court, therefore, made
the best of his way towards the Straits mouth, probably
<PB N="118" REF="124"/>
with intention to join the Brest squadron:<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1744.</NOTE> but he had
orders to protect the Spanish fleet; and as they sailed
heavily, he was obliged to wait for them, at the hazard
of maintaining a battle with the English. Thus circum∣stanced
he made sail and lay to by turns; so that the
British admiral could not engage them in proper order;
and as they outsailed his ships, he began to fear they would
escape him altogether, should he wait for Vice-Admiral
Lestock, who was so far astern. Under this apprehension
he made the signal for engaging, while that for the line of
battle was still displayed; and this inconsistency naturally
introduced confusion. The fight was maintained with
great vivacity by the few who engaged. The Real being
quite disabled, and lying like a wreck upon the water, Mr.
Matthews sent a fireship to destroy her; but the expedient
did not take effect. The ship ordered to cover this ma∣chine
did not obey the signal; so that the captain of the
fireship was exposed to the whole fire of the enemy. Never∣theless,
he continued to advance until he found the vessel
sinking; and being within a few yards of the Real, he set
fire to the fusees. The ship was immediately in slames, in
the midst of which he and his lieutenant, with twelve men,
perished,. This was likewise the fate of a Spanish
launch, which had been mann<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with fifty sailors, to pre∣vent
the fireship from running on board the Real. One
ship of the line belonging to the Spanish squadron struck
to Captain Hawke, who sent a lieutenant to take posses∣sion
of her: she was afterwards retaken by the French
squadron; but was found so disabled, that they left her de∣serted,
and she was next day burned by order of Admiral
Matthews. At night the action ceased; and the Admiral
found his own ship so much damaged, that he moved <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
flag into another. Captain Cornwall fell in the engage∣ment,
after having exhibited a remarkable proof of courage
and intrepidity: but the loss of men was very inconsider∣able.
Next day the enemy appeared to leeward, and the
admiral gave chace till night, when he brought to, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
<PB N="119" REF="125"/>
might be joined by the ships a-stern. They were perceiv∣ed
again on the thirteenth at a considerable distance, and
pursued till the evening. In the morning of the fourteenth,
twenty sail of them were seen distinctly, and Lestock with
his division had gained ground of them considerably by
noon; but Admiral Matthews, displayed the signal for
leaving off chase, and bore away for Port-Mahon, to re∣pair
the damage he had sustained. Mean while the com∣bined
squadrons continued their course towards the coast
of Spain. M. de Court, with his division, anchored in
the road of Alicant; and Don Navarro sailed into the har∣bour
of Carthagena. Admiral Matthews on his arrival
at Minorca, accused Lestock of having misbehaved on the
day of action; suspended him from his office, and sent him
prisoner to England, where, in his turn, he accused his
accuser. Long before the engagement, these two officers
had expressed the most virulent resentment against each
other. Matthews was brave, open, and undisguised; but
proud, imperious, and precipitate. Lestock had signaliz∣ed
his courage on many occasions, and perfectly under∣stood
the whole discipline of the navy; but he was cool,
cunning, and vindictive. He had been treated superci∣liously
by Matthews, and in revenge took advantage of his
errors and precipitation. To gratify this passion, he be∣trayed
the interest and glory of his country; for it is not
to be doubted, but that he might have come up in time to
engage; and, in that case, the fleets of France and Spain
would in all likelihood have been destroyed: but he en∣treched
himself within the punctilios of discipline, and
saw with pleasure his antagonist expose himself to the
hazard of death, ruin, and disgrace. Matthews himself,
in the sequel, sacrificed his duty to his resentment, in re∣straining
Lestock from pursuing and attacking the com∣bined
squadrons on the third day after the engagement,
when they appeared disabled, and in manifest disorder, and
would have fallen an easy prey, had they been vigorously
attacked. One can hardly, without indignation, reflect
<PB N="120" REF="126"/>
upon those instances, in which a community has so severely
suffered from the personal animosity of individuals. The
miscarriage off Toulon became the subject of a parliamen∣tary
enquiry in England. The Commons, in an address
to the throne, desired that a court-martial might be appoint∣ed
to try the delinquents. By this time Lestock had ac∣cused
Matthews, and all the captains of his division who
misbehaved on the day of battle. The court-martial was
constituted, and proceeded to tryal. Several commanders
of ships were cashiered: Vice-Admiral Lestock was hon∣ourably
acquitted; and Admiral Matthews rendered inca∣pable
of serving for the future in his Majesty's navy. All
the world knew that Lestock kept aloof, and that Mat∣thews
rushed into the hottest part of the engagement. Yet
the former triumphed on his tryal, and the latter narrowly
escaped the sentence of death for cowardice and miscon∣duct.
Such decisions are not to be accounted for, except
from prejudice and faction.</P>
<P>§ IX. The war in Germany, which had been almost
extinguished in the last campaign, began to revive, and
raged with redoubled violence. The Emperor had solicit∣ed
the mediation of his Britannick Majesty for compro∣mising
the differences between him and the court of
Vienna. Prince William of Hesse Cassel had conferred
with the King of England on this subject; and a negocia∣tion
was begun at Hanau. The Emperor offered to dis∣miss
the French auxiliaries, provided the Austrians would
evacuate his hereditary dominions. Nay, Prince William
and Lord Carteret, as plenipotentiaries, actually agreed to
preliminaries, by which his Imperial Majesty engaged to
renounce the alliance of France, and throw himself into the
arms of the maritime powers; to resign all pretensions to
the succession of the House of Austria; and to revive the
vote of Bohemia in the electoral college, on condition of
his being re-established in the possession of his dominions;
recognized as Emperor by the Queen of Hungry, and
accommodated with a monthly subsidy for his mainte∣nance,
<PB N="121" REF="127"/>
as his own territories were exhausted and impove∣rished
by the war. By a separate article, the King of
Great-Britain promised to furnish him with three hundred
thousand crowns, and to interpose his good offices with the
Queen of Hungary, that his electoral dominions should be
favourably treated. These preliminaries, though settled,
were not signed. The court of Vienna was unwilling to
part with their conquests in Bavaria and the Upper-Pala∣tinate.
The queen trusted too much to the valour of her
troops, and the wealth of her allies, to listen to such terms
of accommodation; and whatever arguments were used
with the King of Great-Britain, certain it is the negocia∣tion
was dropped, on pretence that the articles were dis∣approved
by the ministry of England. The Emperor, en∣vironed
with distress, renewed his application to the King
of Great-Britain; and even declared that he would refer his
cause to the determination of the maritime powers: but
all his advances were discountenanced; and the treaty of
Worms dispelled all hope of accommodation. In this
manner did the British ministry reject the fairest oppor∣tunity
that could possibly occur of terminating the war in
Germany with honour and advantage, and of freeing
their country from that insufferable burthen of expense
under which she groaned.</P>
<P>§ X. The inflexibility of the house of Austria, and its
chief ally, proved serviceable to the Emperor. The for∣lorn
situation of this unfortunate prince excited the com∣passion
of divers princes: they resented the insolence with
which the head of the empire had been treated by the court
of Vienna; and they were alarmed at the increasing power
of a family noted for pride, tyranny, and ambition. These
considerations gave rise to the treaty of Franckfort, con∣cluded
in May between the Emperor, the King of Prussia,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he King of Sweden as Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, and the
Elector-Palatine. They engaged to preserve the constitu∣tions
of the empire, according to the treaty of Westphalia,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd to support the Emperor in his rank and dignity.
They agreed to employ their good offices with the Queen
<PB N="122" REF="128"/>
of Hungary, that she might be induced to acknowledg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Emperor, to restore his hereditary dominions, an
give up the archives of the empire that were in her posse<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sion.
They guaranteed to each other their respective te<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ritories:
the disputes about the succession of the late Em<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>peror
they referred to the decision of the states of the em¦pire:
they promised to assist one another in case of be in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
attacked; and they invited the King of Poland, the Elec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tor
of Cologn, and the Bishop of Liege, to accede<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
this treaty. Such was the confederacy that broke all th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
measures which had been concerted between the King
of Great-Britain and her Hungarian Majesty for the ope<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rations
of the campaign. In the mean time, the French
King declared war against this princess, on preten<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
that she was obstinately deaf to all terms of accommoda<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion,
and determined to carry the war into the territorie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of France. In her counter-declaration she taxed Loui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
with having infringed the most solemn engagement with
respect to the pragmatick sanction; with having spirited
up different pretenders to lay claim to the succession of the
late Emperor; with having endevoured to instigate the
common enemy of Christendom against her; and with
having acted the incendiary in the north of Europe, that
the Czarina might be prevented from assisting the house
of Austria, while his numerous armies overspread the
empire, and desolated her hereditary countries. These
recriminations were literally true. The houses of Bour∣bon
and Austria have, for many centuries, been the com∣mon
disturbers and plagues of Europe.</P>
<P>§ XI. The King of France, though in himself pacifick
and unenterprising, was stimulated by his ministry to
taste the glory and conquest in the Netherlands, where he
had assembled an army of one hundred and twenty thou∣sand
men, provided with a very formidable train of ar∣tillery.
The chief command was vested in the Mareschal
Count de Saxe, who possessed great military talents, and
proved to be one of the most fortunate generals of the age in
which be lived. The allied forces, consisting of English,
<PB N="123" REF="129"/>
Hanoverians, Dutch, and Austrians, to the number of
seventy thousand effective men, were in the month of
May assembled in the neighbourhood of Brussels, from
whence they marched towards Oudenarde, and posted
themselves behind the Schelde, being unable to retard the
progress of the enemy. The French Monarch, attended
by his favourite ladies, with all the pomp of eastern lux∣ury,
arrived at Lisle on the twelfth day of the same
month; and in the adjacent plain reviewed his army.
The States-General, alarmed at his preparations, had, in
a conference with his ambassador at the Hague, expressed
their apprehensions, and entreated his Most Christian
Majesty would desist from his design of attacking their
barrier. Their remonstrances having proved ineffectual,
they now sent a minister to wait upon that monarch, to
enforce their former representations, and repeat their entrea∣ties:
but no regard was paid to his request. The French
King told him, he was determined to prosecute the war
with vigour, as his moderation hitherto had served to no
other purpose but that of rendering his enemies more in∣tractable.
Accordingly, his troops invested Menin, which
was in seven days surrendered upon capitulation. Ypres,
Fort Knocke, and Furnes underwent the same fate;
and on the twenty-ninth day of June the King of
France entered Dunkirk in triumph.</P>
<P>§ XII. He had taken such precautions for the defence
of Alsace, which was guarded by considerable armies
under the command of Coigni and Seckendorf, that he
thought he had nothing to fear from the Austrians in that
quarter: besides, he had received secret assurances that the
King of Prussia would declare for the Emperor; so
that he resolved to pursue his conquests in the Nether∣lands.
But all his measures were defeated by the activity
of Prince Charles of Lorraine, and his officers, who found
means to pass the Rhine, and oblige the French and Ba∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arian
generals to retire to Lampertheim, that they
might cover Strasburgh. The Austrians made themselves
masters of Haguenau and Saverne: they secured the
<PB N="124" REF="130"/>
passes of Lorraine; and laid all the country of Lowe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Alsace under contribution. The King of France was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
sooner apprised of the prince's having passed the Rhine<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and penetrated into this province, than he sent off a de∣tachment
of thirty thousand men from his army in Flan∣ders
to re-enforce that under the Mareschal de Coigny▪
and he himself began his journey from the Rhine, that he
might in person check the progress of the enemy: but
this design was anticipated by a severe distemper that
overtook him at Metz in Lorraine. The physicians de∣spaired
of his life. The Queen, with her children, and
all the princes of the blood, hastened from Versailles to
pay their last duties to their dying sovereign, who, as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
true penitent, dismissed his concubines, and began to pre∣pare
himself for death: yet the strength of his constitu∣tion
triumphed over the fever, and his recovery was cele∣brated
all over his dominions with uncommon marks o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
joy and affection.</P>
<P>§ XIII. In the mean time the schemes of the Au∣strian
general were frustrated by the King of Prussia,
who, in the month of August, entered the electorate of
Saxony, at the head of a numerous army. There he de∣clared,
in a publick manifesto, that his aims were only to
re-establish the peace of the empire, and to support the
dignity of its head. He affured the inhabitants that they
might depend upon his protection, in case they should
remain quiet; but threatened them with fire and sword
should they presume to oppose his arms. In a rescript
addressed to his ministers at foreign courts, he accused
the Queen of Hungary of obstinacy, in refusing to ac∣knowledge
the Emperor, and restore his hereditary domi∣nions:
he said he had engaged in the league of Franck∣fort,
to hinder the head of the empire from being op∣pressed:
that he had no intention to violate the peace of
Breslau, or enter as a principal into this war: he assirmed,
that his design was to act as auxiliary to the Emperor,
and establish the quiet of Germany. He penetrated into Bo∣hemia
and undertook the siege of Prague, the governor of
<PB N="125" REF="131"/>
which surrendered himself and his garrison prisoners of
war on the sixteenth day of September. He afterwards
reduced Tabor, Bodweis, and Teyn, and in a word sub∣dued
the greatest part of the kingdom; the Austrian
forces in that country being in no condition to stop
his progress. Nevertheless, he was soon obliged to re∣linquish
his conquests. Prince Charles of Lorraine was
recalled from Alsace, and repassed the Rhine in the face
of the French army, commanded by the Mareschals de
Coigni, Noailles, and Belleisle. Then he marched to
the Danube, laid the Upper Palatinate under contribu∣tion,
and entering Bohemia, joined the troops under
Bathiani at Merotitz. The King of Poland Elector of
Saxony, at this juncture, declared in favour of her Hun∣garian
Majesty. A convention for the mutual guarantee
of their dominions had been signed between these two
powers in December; and now Prince Charles of Lor∣taine
was re-enforced by twenty thousand Saxon troops,
under the conduct of the Duke of Saxe-Wessenfels. The
combined army was superior to that of his Prussian Ma∣jesty,
whom they resolved to engage. But he retired
before them, and having evacuated all the places he had
garrisoned in Bohemia, retreated with precipitation into
Silesia. There his troops were put into winter-quarters;
and he himself returned to Berlin, extremely mortified at
the issue of the campaign.</P>
<P>§ XIV. During these transactions, Count Seckendorf
marched into Bavaria, at the head of a strong army,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rove the Austrians out of that electorate, and the Em∣peror
regained possession of Munich, his capital, on the
twenty-second day of October. In August the French
army passed the Rhine at Fort-Louis, and invested the
strong and important city of Fribourg, de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended by Ge∣neral
Demnitz, at the head of nine thousand veterans.
The King of France arrived in the camp on the eleventh
day of October; and the siege was carried on with un∣common
vigour. The Austrian governour made incredible
efforts in the defence of the p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace, which he maintained
<PB N="126" REF="132"/>
until it was reduced to a heap of ruins, and one half of
the garrison destroyed. At length, however, they were
obliged to surrender themselves prisoners of war, after the
trenches had been opened five-and-forty days, during
which they had killed above fifteen thousand of the be∣siegers.
With this conquest, the French King closed the
campaign, and his army was cantoned along the Rhine,
under the inspection of the Count de Maillebois. By the
detachments drawn from the French army in Flanders,
Count Saxe had found himself considerably weaker than
the confederates: he threw up strong entrenchments behind
the Lys, where he remained on the defensive, until he was
re-enforced by the Count de Clermont, who commanded
a separate body on the side of Newport. The allies, to the
number of seventy thousand, passed the Schelde, and ad∣vanced
towards Helchin: but the enemy being so advan∣tageously
posted, that they could not attack him with any
prospect of advantage, they filed on in sight of Tournay;
and on the eighth day of August encamped in the plains of
Lisle, in hope of drawing Count Saxe from the situation
in which he was so strongly fortified. Here they foraged for
several days, and laid the open country under contribu∣tion:
however, they made no attempt upon the place it∣self,
which in all probability would have fallen into their
hands had they invested it at their first approach; for then
there was no other garrison but two or three battalions
of militia; but Count Saxe soon threw in a considerable
re-enforcement. The allies were unprovided with a train
of battering cannon; and their commanders would not
deviate from the usual forms of war. Besides, they were
divided in their opinions, and despised one another. Ge∣neral
Wade, who commanded the English and Hanove∣rians,
was a vain, weak man, without confidence,
weight, or authority; and the Austrian general, the
Duke d'Aremberg, was a proud, rapacious glutton,
devoid of talents and sentiment. After having re∣mained
for some time in sight of Lisle, and made a
general forage without molestation, they retired to their
<PB N="127" REF="133"/>
former camp on the Schelde, from whence they soon
marched into winter-quarters. Count Saxe at length
quitted his lines; and, by way of retaliation, sent out
detachments to ravage the Low-Countries, to the very
gates of Ghent and Bruges. The conduct of the allied
generals was severely censured in England, and ridiculed
in France, not only in private conversation but also on
their publick theatres, where it became the subject of
farces and pantomimes.</P>
<P>§ XV. The campaign in Italy produced divers vicissi∣tudes
of fortune. The King of Naples having assembled
an army, joined Count Gages, and published a manifesto
in vindication of his conduct, which was a direct viola∣tion
of the neutrality he had promised to observe. He
maintained, that his moderation had been undervalued by
the courts of London and Vienna; that his frontiers were
threatened with the calamities of war; and that the
Queen of Hungary made no secret of her intention to
invade his dominions. This charge was not without
foundation. The emissaries of the house of Austria en∣deavoured
to excite a rebellion in Naples, which Prince
Lobkowitz had orders to favour by an invasion. This
general was encamped at Monte Rotundo, in the neigh∣bourhood
of Rome, when, in the month of June, the
confederates advanced to Velletri. While the two ar∣mies
remained in sight of each other, Prince Lobkowitz
detached a strong body of forces, under Count Soro and
General Gorani, who made an irruption into the pro∣vince
of Abruzzo, and took the city of Aquila, where
they distributed a manifesto, in which the Queen of Hun∣gary
exhorted the Neapolitans to shake off the Spanish
yoke, and submit again to the House of Austria. This
step, however, produced little or no effect; and the Au∣strian
detachment retired at the approach of the Duke of
Vieuville, with a superior number of forces. In August.
Count Brown, at the head of an Austrian detachment.
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rprised Velletri in the night; and the King of the Two
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icilies, with the Duke of Modena, were in the utmost
<PB N="128" REF="134"/>
danger of being taken. They escaped by a postern <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
great difficulty, and repaired to the quarters of Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Gages, who performed the part of a great general <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
this occasion. He rallied the fugitives, dispelled the pa∣nick
and confusion which had begun to prevail in his
camp, and made a disposition for cutting off the retreat <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the Austrians. Count Brown, finding himself in danger<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of being surrounded, thought proper to secure his retreat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
which he affected with great art and gallantry, carrying of
a prodigious booty. Three thousand Spaniards are said to
have fallen in this action; and eight hundred men were
taken, with some standards and colours. Count Mariani▪
a Neapolitan general, was among the prisoners. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Austrians lost above six hundred men; and General Ne∣vati
fell into the hands of the enemy; but the explo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
produced no consequence of importance. The heats <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
autumn proved so fatal to the Austrians, who were n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
accustomed to the climate, that Prince Lobkowitz sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his army mouldering away, without any possibility <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
its being recruited: besides the country was so draine<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
that he could no longer procure subsistence. Impelled b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
these considerations, he meditated a retreat. On the
eleventh day of November, he decamped from Faiol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
marched under the walls of Rome, passed the Tybur a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Ponte Molle, formerly known by the name of Pons Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vius,
which he had just time to break down behind hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
when the vanguard of the Spaniards and Neapolitans ap∣peared.
Part of his rear-guard, however, was taken
with Count Soro who commanded it, at Nocera; an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his army suffered greatly by desertion. Nevertheless, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
continued his retreat with equal skill and expedition<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
passed the mountains of Gubio, and by the way of Vi∣terbo
reached the Bolognese. The Pope was altogethe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
passive. In the beginning of the campaign he had ca∣ressed
Lobkowitz; and now he received the King <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the Two Sicilies with marks of the warmest affection<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
That prince having visited the chief curiosities of Rome<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="129" REF="135"/>
returned to Naples, leaving part of his troops under the
command of Count Gages.</P>
<P>§ XVI. Fortune likewise favoured his brother Don
Philip in Savoy and Piedmont. He was early in the sea∣son
joined at Antibes by the French army, under the con∣duct
of the Prince of Conti. In the latter end of March,
the combined forces passed the Var, reduced the Castle of
Aspremont, and entered the city of Nice, without oppo∣sition.
In April, they attacked the King of Sardinia,
who, with twenty thousand men, was strongly entrenched
among the mountains at Villa-Franca. The action was
obstinate and bloody; but their numbers and perseverance
prevailed. He was obliged to abandon his posts, and em∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ark
on board of the British squadron, which transported
him and his troops to Vado. The intention of Don
Philip was to penetrate through the territories of Genoa
into the Milanese; but Admiral Matthews, who hovered
with a strong squadron on that coast, sent a message to the
republic, declaring, that should the combined army be
suffered to pass through her dominions, the King of Great-Britain
would consider such a step as a breach of their
neutrality. The senate, intimidated by this intimation,
entreated the princes to defist from their design; and they
resolved to choose another route. They desiled towards
Piedmont, and assaulted the strong post of Chateau-Dau∣phiné,
defended by the King of Sardinia in person. After
a desperate attack, in which they lost four thousand men,
the place was taken: the garrison of Demont surrendered
at discretion, and the whole country of Piedmont was laid
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nder contribution. His Sardinian Majesty was not in a
condition to hazard a battle; and, therefore, posted himself
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Saluzzes, in order to cover his capital. The combined
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmy advanced to the strong and important town of Coni,
which was invested in the beginning of September. Baron
Ce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trum the governor made an obstinate defence, and the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tuation of the place was such as rendered the siege diffi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ult,
tedious, and bloody. The King of Sardinia being
re-enforced by ten thousand Austrians, under General Pal∣lavicini,
<PB N="130" REF="136"/>
advanced to its relief, and a battle ensued. The
action was maintained with great vigour on both sides,
till night, when his Majesty finding it impracticable to
force the enemy's entrenchments, retired in good order to
his camp at Murasso. He afterwards found means to
throw a re-enforcement and supply of provisions into Coni;
and the heavy rains that fell at this period, not only re∣tarded,
but even dispirited the besiegers. Nevertheless, the
princes persisted in their design, notwithstanding a dearth
of provisions, and the approach of winter, till the latter
end of November, when the Chevalier de Soto entered
the place with six hundred fresh men. This incident was
no sooner known, than the princes abandoned their en∣terprise;
and leaving their sick and wounded to the mercy
of the Piedmontese, marched back to Demont. Having
dismantled the fortifications of this place, they retreated
with great precipitation to Dauphiné, and were dread∣fully
harrassed by the Vaudois and light troops in the ser∣vice
of his Sardinian Majesty, who now again saw him∣self
in possession of Piedmont. The French troops were
quartered in Dauphiné: but Don Philip still maintained
his footing in Savoy, the inhabitants of which he fleeced
without mercy.</P>
<P>§ XVII. After the action at Toulon, nothing of conse∣quence
was atchieved by the British squadron in the Medi∣terranean;
and indeed the naval power of Great-Britain
was, during the summer, quite inactive. In the month
of June, Commodore Anson returned from his voyage of
three years and nine months, in which he had surrounded
the terraqueous globe. We have formerly observed, that
he sailed with a small squadron to the South-Sea, in order
to annoy the Spanish settlements of Chili and Peru. Two
of his large ships having been separated from him in a storm
before he weathered Cape-Horn, had put in at Rio de
Janiero, on the coast of Brasil, from whence they re∣turned
to Europe. A frigate, commanded by Captain
Cheap, was shipwrecked on a desolate island in the South-Sea.
Mr. Anson having undergone a dreadful tempest,
<PB N="131" REF="137"/>
which dispersed his fleet, arrived at the island of Juan
Fernandez, where he was joined by the Gloucester, a ship
of the line, a sloop, and a pink loaded with provisions.
These were the remains of his squadron. He made prize
of several vessels; took and burned the little town of
Payta; set sail from the coast of Mexico, for the Philip∣pine
isles; and in this passage the Gloucester was aban∣doned
and sunk: the other vessels had been destroyed for
want of men to navigate them, so that nothing now re∣mained
but the commodore's own ship, the Centurion, and
that but very indifferently manned; for the crews had
been horribly thinned by sickness. Incredible were the
hardships and misery they sustained from the shattered con∣dition
of the ships, and the scorbutick disorder, when they
reached the plentiful island of Tinian, where they were
supplied with the necessary refreshments. Thence they
prosecuted their voyage to the river of Canton in China,
where the commodore ordered the ship to be sheathed, and
found means to procure a re-enforcement of sailors. The
chief object of his attention was the rich annual ship that
sails between Acapulco in Mexico, and Manilla, one of
the Phillippine islands. In hopes of intercepting her, he
set sail from Canton, and steered his course back to the
straits of Manilla, where she actually fell into his hands,
after a short but vigorous engagement. The prize was
called Neustra Signora de Cabodonga, mounted with forty
guns, manned with six hundred sailors, and loaded with
treasure and effects to the value of three hundred and thir∣teen
thousand pounds sterling: with this windfall, he re∣turned
to Canton; from whence he proceeded to the
Cape of Good-Hope, and prosecuted his voyage to Eng∣land,
where he arrived in safety. Though this fortunate
commander enriched himself by an occurrence that may be
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ermed almost accidental, the British nation was not in∣demnified
for the expense of the expedition; and the ori∣ginal
design was entirely defeated. Had the Manilla
ship escaped the vigilance of the English commodore, he
might have been, at his return to England, laid aside as a
<PB N="132" REF="138"/>
superannuated captain, and died in obscurity: but his
great wealth invested him with considerable influence, and
added lustre to his talents. He soon became the oracle
which was consulted in all naval deliberations; and the
King raised him to the dignity of a peerage. In July, Sir
John Balchen, an admiral of approved valour and great ex∣perience,
sailed from Spithead with a strong squadron, in
quest of an opportunity to attack the French fleet at Brest,
under the command of M. de Rochambault. In the bay
of Biscay he was overtaken by a violent storm, that dispersed
the ships, and drove them up the English channel. Ad∣miral
Stewart, with the greater part of them, arrived at
Plymouth; but Sir John Balchen's own ship, the Victory,
which was counted the most beautiful first rate in the
world, foundered at sea; and this brave commander pe∣rished,
with all his officers, volunteers, and crew, amount∣ing
to eleven hundred choice seamen. On the fourth day
of October, after the siege of Friburg, the Marshal Duke
de Belleisle, and his brother, happened, in their way to
Berlin, to halt at a village in the forest of Hartz, depend∣ent
on the electorate of Hanover. There they were ap∣prehended
by the bailiff of the place, and conducted as
prisoners to Osterode; from whence they were removed to
Stade on the Elbe, where they embarked for England.
They resided at Windsor till the following year, when they
were allowed the benefit of the cartel which had been esta∣blished
between Great-Britain and France at Franckfort,
and released accordingly, after they had been treated by
the British nobility with that respect and hospitality which
was due to their rank and merit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pope, the celebrated poet, died in the month of June. In Octo∣ber, the old Duchess of Marlborough resigned her breath, in the eighty-fifth year of her age; immensely rich, and very little regretted, either by her own family, or the world in general.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. The dissentions in the British cabinet were
now ripened into another revolution in the ministry.
Lord Carteret, who was by this time Earl Granville in
consequence of his mother's death, had engrossed the royal
favour so much, that the Duke of N—and his brother
<PB N="133" REF="139"/>
are said to have taken umbrage at his influence and great∣ness.
He had incurred the resentment of those who were
distinguished by the appellation of Patriots, and entirely
forfeited his popularity. The two brothers were very
powerful by their parliamentary interest: they knew their
own strength, and engaged in a political alliance with the
leading men in the opposition, against the prime minister
and his measures. This coalition was dignified with the
epithet of “The Broad Bottom,” as if it had been establish∣ed
on a true constitutional foundation, comprehending in∣dividuals
of every class, without distinction of party. The
appellation, however, which they assumed was afterwards
converted into a term of derision. The Earl of G—
perceiving the gathering storm, and foreseeing the im∣possibility
of withstanding such an opposition in parlia∣ment,
wisely avoided the impending danger and disgrace,
by a voluntary resignation of his employments. The
Earl of Harrington succeeded him as secretary of state.
The Duke of Bedford was appointed first lord of the Ad∣miralty,
and the Earl of Chesterfield declared lord-lieu∣tenant
of Ireland. The Lords Gower and Cobham were
re-established in the offices they had resigned: Mr. Lyttel∣ton
was admitted as a commissioner of the Treasury; even
Sir John Hynde Cotton accepted of a place at court; and
Sir John Phillips sat at the board of trade and plantations,
though he soon renounced this employment. This was
rather a change of men than of measures, and turned out
to the ease and advantage of the sovereign; for his views
were no longer thwarted by an obstinate opposition in
parliament. The session was opened on the twenty-eighth
day of November, in the usual manner. The Commons
unanimously granted about six millions and an half for
the service of the ensuing year, to be raised by the land,
the malt, and the salt-taxes, the sinking-fund, and an
additional duty on wines. In January, the Earl of Chester∣field
set out for the Hague, with the character of am∣bassador
extraordinary, to persuade, if possible, the States-General
to engage heartily in the war. About the same
<PB N="134" REF="140"/>
time, a treaty of quadruple alliance was signed at War∣saw,
by the Queen of Hungary, the King of Poland,
and the maritime powers. This was a mutual guarantee
of the dominions belonging to the contracting parties:
but his Polish majesty was paid for his concurrence, with
an annual subsidy of one hundred and fifty thousand
pounds, two thirds of which were defrayed by England,
and the remainder was disbursed by the United Pro∣vinces<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robert Earl of Orford, late prime minister, died in March, after having for a very short time enjoyed a pension of four thousand pounds granted by the crown, in consideration of his past services. Though he had for such a length of time directed the application of the publick <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea∣sure, his circumstances were not affluent: he was liberal in his disposi∣tion, and had such a number of rapacious dependents to gratify, that lit∣tle was left for his own private occasions.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>§ XIX. The business of the British parliament being
discussed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1745.</NOTE> the session was closed in the beginning of
May; and immediately after the prorogation the King
set out for Hanover. The death of the Emperor
Charles VII. which happened in the month of January,
had entirely changed the face of affairs in the em∣pire,
and all the princes of Germany were in commotion.
The Grand Duke of Tuscany, consort to her Hungarian
Majesty, was immediately declared a candidate for the
Imperial crown; while his pretensions were warmly op∣posed
by the French King and his allies. The court of
Vienna, taking advantage of the late Emperor's death,
sent an army of invade Bavaria in the month of March,
under the conduct of General Bathiani, who routed
the French and Palatine troops at Psiffenhoven; took
possession of Rain; surrounded and disarmed six thousand
Hessians in the neighbourhood of Ingoldstadt; and drove
the Bavarian forces out of the electorate. The young
elector was obliged to abandon his capital, and retire to
Augsburgh, where he found himself in danger of losing
all his dominions. In this emergency, he yielded to
the earnest sollicitations of the Empress his mother, en∣forced
by the advice of his uncle, the Elector of Cologn,
and of his general, Count Seckendorff, who exhorted him
<PB N="135" REF="141"/>
to be reconciled to the court of Vienna. A negotiation
was immediately begun at Fuessen, where in April the
treaty was concluded. The Queen consented to recog∣nize
the imperial dignity, as having been vested in the
person of his father; to acknowledge his mother as Em∣press
Dowager; to restore his dominions, with all the
fortresses, artillery, stores, and ammunition, which she
had taken: on the other hand, he renounced all claim to
the succession of her father, and became guarantee of the
pragmatick sanction; he acknowledged the validity of
the electoral vote of Bohemia in the person of the Queen;
and engaged to give his voice for the Grand Duke, at
the ensuing election of a king of the Romans. Until
that should be determined, both parties agreed that Ingold∣stadt
should be garrisoned by neutral troops; and that
Braunau and Schardingen, with all the country lying
between the Inn and the Saltza, should remain in the
Queen's possession, though without prejudice to the civil
government, or the Elector's revenue. In the mean
time he dismissed the auxiliaries that were in his pay, and
they were permitted to retire without molestation.</P>
<P>§ XX. The court of Vienna had now secured the votes
of all the electors, except those of Brandenburgh and the
Palatinate. Nevertheless, France assembled a powerful
army in the neighbourhood of Franckfort, in order to in∣fluence
the election: But the Austrian army, commanded
by the Grand Duke in person, marched thither from the
Danube; and the Prince of Conti was obliged to repass
the Rhine at Nordlingen. Then the Great Duke repaired
to Franckfort, where, on the second day of September,
he was by a majority of voices declared king of the
Romans, and emperor of Germany. Mean while the
King of Prussia had made great progress in the conquest
of Silesia. The campaign began in January, when the
Hungarian insurgents were obliged to retire into Moravia:
In the following month the Prussian General Lehwald
defeated a body of twelve thousand Austrians, commanded
by General Hel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rich: the town of Ratibor was taken by
<PB N="136" REF="142"/>
assault; and the King entered Silesia in May, at the head
of seventy thousand men. Prince Charles of Lorraine,
being joined by the Duke of Saxe-Wessenfels and twenty-thousand
Saxons, penetrated into Silesia by the defiles of
Landshut; and were attacked by his Prussian Majesty in
the plains of Striegan, near Friedberg. The battle was
maintained from morning till noon, when the Saxons
giving way, Prince Charles was obliged to retire with the
loss of twelve thousand men, and a great number of
colours, standards, and artillery. This victory, obtained on
the fourth day of June, complete as it was, did not prove
decisive; for, though the victor transferred the seat of the
war into Bohemia, and maintained his army by raising
contributions in that country, the Austrians resolved to
hazard another engagement. Their aim was to surprise
him in his camp at Sohr, which they attacked on the thir∣tieth
of September, at day-break: but they met with such
a warm reception, that notwithstanding their repeated ef∣forts
during the space of four hours, they were repulsed
with considerable damage, and retreated to Jaromire, leaving
five thousand killed upon the spot, besides two thousand
that were taken, with many standards, and twenty pieces of
cannon. The loss of this battle was in a great measure
owing to the avarice of the irregulars, who having pene∣trated
into the Prussian camp, began to pillage with great
eagerness, giving the King an opportunity to rally his
disordered troops, and restore the battle: nevertheless,
they retired with the plunder of his baggage, including
his military chest, the officers of his chancery, his own
secretary, and all the papers of his cabinet.</P>
<P>§ XXI. After this action his Prussian Majesty returned
to Berlin, and breathed nothing but peace and modera∣tion.
In August he had signed a convention with the
King of Great-Britain, who became guarantee of his
possessions in Silesia, as yielded by the treaty of Breslau;
and he promised to vote for the Grand Duke of Tuscany
at the election of an emperor. This was intended as
the basis of a more general accommodation. But he
<PB N="137" REF="143"/>
now pretended to have received undoubted intelligence,
that the King of Poland and the Queen of Hungary had
agreed to invade Brandenburgh with three different ar∣mies;
and that for this purpose his Polish Majesty had
demanded of the Czarina the succours stipulated by
treaty between the two crowns. Alarmed, or seemingly
alarmed, at this information, he sollicited the maritime
powers to fulfil their engagements, and interpose their
good offices with the court of Petersburgh. Yet, far from
waiting for the result of these remonstrances, he made a
sudden irruption into Lusatia, took possession of Gorlitz,
and obliged Prince Charles of Lorraine to retire before
him into Bohemia. Then he entered Leipsick, and laid
Saxony under contribution. The King of Poland, un∣able
to resist the torrent, quitted his capital, and took re∣fuge
in Prague. His troops, re-enforced by a body of
Austrians, were defeated at Pirna on the fifteenth day of
December; and his Prussian Majesty became master of
Dresden without further opposition. The King of Po∣land,
thus deprived of his hereditary dominions, was
fain to acquiesce in such terms as the conqueror thought
proper to impose; and the treaty of Dresden was con∣cluded,
under the mediation of his Britannick Majesty.
By this convention the King of Prussia retained all the
contributions he had levied in Saxony; and was entitled
to a million of German crowns, to be paid by his Po∣lish
Majesty at the next fair of Leipsick. He and the
Elector Palatine consented to acknowledge the Grand
Duke as Emperor of Germany; and this last confirmed
to his Prussian Majesty certain privileges <HI>de non evocando,</HI>
which had been granted by the late Emperor, with regard
to some territories possessed by the King of Prussia,
though not belonging to the electorate of Brandenburgh.
Immediately after the ratification of this treaty, the Prus∣sian
troops evacuated Saxony; and the peace of Germa∣ny
was restored.</P>
<P>§ XXII. Though the French King could not prevent
the elevation of the Grand Duke to the Imperial throne,
<PB N="138" REF="144"/>
he resolved to humble the house of Austria, by making a
conquest of the Netherlands. A prodigious army was there
assembled, under the auspices of Mareschal Count de Saxe;
and his Most Christian Majesty, with the Dauphin, ar∣riving
in the camp, they invested the strong town of
Tournay on the thirtieth day of April. The Dutch garri∣son
consisted of eight thousand men, commanded by the old
Baron Dorth, who made a vigorous defence. The Duke
of Cumberland assumed the chief command of the allied
army assembled at Soignies: he was assisted with the ad∣vice
of the Count Konigseg, an Austrian general, and
the Prince of Waldeck, commander of the Dutch forces.
Their army was greatly inferior in number to that of the
enemy; nevertheless, they resolved to march to the relie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of Tournay. They accordingly advanced to Leuse; and
on the twenty-eighth day of April took post at Maulbre,
in fight of the French army, which was encamped on an
eminence, from the village of Antoine to a large wood
beyond Vezon, having Fontenoy in their front. Next
day was employed by the allies in driving the enemy from
some outposts, and clearing the defiles through which
they were obliged to advance to the attack; while the
French completed their batteries, and made the most for∣midable
preparations for their reception. On the thirtieth
day of April the Duke of Cumberland having made the
proper dispositions, began his march to the enemy at two
o'clock in the morning: a brisk cannonade ensued; and
about nine both armies were engaged. The British in∣fantry
drove the French beyond their lines: but the left
wing failing in the attack on the village of Fontenoy, and
the cavalry forbearing to advance on the flanks, they
measured back their ground with some disorder, from the
prodigious fire of the French batteries. They rallied,
however, and returning to the charge with redoubled ar∣dour,
repulsed the enemy to their camp with great slaugh∣ter:
but, being wholly unsupported by the other wing,
and exposed both in front and flank to a dreadful fire,
which did great execution, the Duke was obliged to make
<PB N="139" REF="145"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e necessary dispositions for a retreat about three o'clock
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the afternoon; and this was effected in tolerable or∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er.
The battle was fought with great obstinacy, and the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arnage on both sides was very considerable. The allies
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> about twelve thousand men, including a good number
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f officers; among these were Lieutenant-General Camp∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell,
and Major-General Ponsonby. The victory cost the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rench almost an equal number of lives; and no honour
was lost by the vanquished. Had the allies given battle
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the preceding day, before the enemy had taken their
measures, and received all their re-enforcements, they
might have succeeded in their endeavours to relieve Tour∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay.
Although the attack was generally judged rash and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>recipitate, the British and Hanoverian troops fought
with such intrepidity and perseverance, that if they had
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een properly sustained by the Dutch forces, and their
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anks covered by the cavalry, the French, in all likeli∣hood,
would have been obliged to abandon their enter∣prise.
The Duke of Cumberland left his sick and wound∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
to the humanity of the victors; and retiring to Aeth,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncamped in an advantageous situation at Lessines. The
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arrison of Tournay, though now deprived of all hope
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f succour, maintained the place to the twenty-first day
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f June, when the governor obtained an honourable capi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulation.
After the conquest of this frontier, which was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ismantled, the Duke of Cumberland, apprehending the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nemy had a design upon Ghent, sent a detachment of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our thousand men to re-enforce the garrison of that city:
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut they fell into an ambuscade at Pas-du-mêle; and
were killed or taken, except a few dragoons that escap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
to Ostend: on that very night, which was the twelfth
of June, Ghent was surprised by a detachment of the
French army. Then they invested Ostend, which,
though defended by an English garrison, and open to the
sea, was after a short siege surrendered by capitulation on
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he fourteenth day of August. Dendermonde, Oude∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arde,
Newport, and Aeth underwent the same fate;
while the allied army lay entrenched beyond the canal of
<PB N="140" REF="146"/>
Antwerp. The French King having subdued the greatest
part of the Austrian Netherlands, returned to Paris, which
he entered in triumph.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. The campaign in Italy was unpropitious to
the Queen of Hungary and the King of Sardinia. Count
Gages passed the Appennines; and entered the state of Luc∣ca:
from thence he proceeded by the eastern coast of
Genoa to Lestride-Levante. The junction of the two
armies was thus accomplished, and re-enforced with ten
thousand Genoese: mean while Prince Lobkowitz de∣camped
from Modena, and took post at Parma: but he
was soon succeeded by Count Schuylemberg, and sent to
command the Austrians in Bohemia. The Spaniards en∣tered
the Milanese without further opposition. Count
Gages, with thirty thousand men, took possession of Ser∣ravalle;
and advancing towards Placentia, obliged the
Austrians to retire under the cannon of Tortona: but
when Don Philip, at the head of forty thousand troops,
made himself master of Acqui, the King of Sardinia and
the Austrian general, unable to stem the torrent, re∣treated
behind the Tanaro. The strong citadel of Torto∣na
was taken by the Spaniards, who likewise reduced
Parma and Placentia: and forcing the passage of the Ta∣naro,
compelled his Sardinian Majesty to take shelter on
the other side of the Po. Then Pavia was won by sca∣lade;
and the city of Milan submitted to the Infant,
though the Austrian garrison still maintained the citadel:
all Piedmont, on both sides of the Po, as far as Turin,
was reduced, and even that capital threatened with a
siege: so that by the month of October the territories be∣longing
to the house of Austria, in Italy, were wholly
subdued; and the King of Sardinia stripped of all his do∣minions:
yet he continued firm and true to his engage∣ments,
and deaf to all proposals of a separate accommo∣dation.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. The naval transactions of Great-Britain were
in the course of this year remarkably spirited. In the
Mediterranean, Admiral Rowley had succeeded Matthews
<PB N="141" REF="147"/>
in the command: Savona, Genoa, Final, St. Remo, with
Bastia, the capital of Corsica, were bombarded: several
Spanish ships were taken: but he could not prevent the
safe arrival of their rich Havannah squadron at Corunna.
Commodore Barnet, in the East-Indies, made prize of
several French ships richly laden; and Commodore Town∣shend,
in the latitude of Martinico, took about thirty mer∣chant
ships belonging to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nemy, under convoy of four
ships of war, two of which were destroyed. The English
privateers likewise met with uncommon success. But the
most important atchievement was the conquest of Louis∣bourg
on the isle of Cape-Breton, in North-America; a
place of great consequence, which the French had for∣tified
at a prodigious expense. The scheme of reducing
this fortress was planned in Boston, recommended by their
general assembly, and approved by his Majesty, who sent
instructions to Commodore Warren, stationed off the Lee∣ward-Islands,
to sail for the northern parts of America,
and co-operate with the forces of New-England in this
expedition. A body of six thousand men was formed un∣der
the conduct of Mr. Pepperel, a trader of Piscataquay,
whose influence was extensive in that country; though
he was a man of little or no education, and utterly unac∣quainted
with military operations. In April Mr. Warren
arrived at Canso with ten ships of war; and the troops of
New-England being embarked in transports, sailed im∣mediately
for the Isle of Cape-Breton, where they landed
without opposition. The enemy abandoned their grand
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>attery, which was detached from the town: and the im∣mediate
seisure of it contributed in a good measure to the
success of the enterprise. While the American troops,
re-enforced by eight hundred marines, carried on their
approaches by land, the squadron blocked up the places by
sea in such a manner, that no succours could be introduced.
A French ship of the line, with some smaller vessels de∣stined
for the relief of the garrison, were intercepted and
taken by the British cruisers; and, indeed, the reduction
of Louisbourg was chiefly owing to the vigilance and activity
<PB N="142" REF="148"/>
of Mr. Warren, one of the bravest and best officers in the
service of England. The operations of the siege were
wholly conducted by the engineers and officers who com∣manded
the British marines; and the Americans being
ignorant of war, were contented to act under their direc∣tions.
The town being considerably damaged by the
bombs and bullets of the besiegers, and the garrison de∣spairing
of relief, the governor capitulated on the seven∣teenth
day of June, when the city of Louisbourg, and the
isle of Cape-Breton, were surrendered to his Britannick
Majesty. The garrison and inhabitants engaged that
they would not bear arms for twelve months against Great-Britain
or her allies; and being embarked in fourteen
cartel ships, were transported to Rochefort. In a few days
after the surrender of Louisbourg, two French East-India-ships,
and another from Peru, laden with treasure, sailed
into the harbour, on the supposition that it still belonged
to France, and were taken by the English squadron.</P>
<P>§ XXV. The news of this conquest being transmitted to
England, Mr. Pepperel was preferred to the dignity of a
baronet of Great-Britain, and congratulatory addresses were
presented to the King on the success of his Majesty's arms.
The possession of Cape-Breton was, doubtless, a valuable
acquisition to Great Britain. It not only distressed the
French in their fishery and navigation, but removed all
fears of encroachment and rivalship from the English fish∣ers
on the banks of Newfoundland. It freed New-England
from the terrors of a dangerous neighbour: over-awed the
Indians of that country; and secured the possession of
Acadia to the crown of Great-Britain. The plan of
this conquest was originally laid by Mr. Auchmuty,
judge-advocate of the court of Admiralty in New-En∣gland.
He demonstrated that the reduction of Cape-Breton
would put the English in sole possession of the
fishery of North-America, which would annually return
to Great-Britain two millions sterling for the manu∣factures
yearly shipped to the plantations; employ many
<PB N="143" REF="149"/>
thousand families that were otherwise unserviceable to the
publick; increase the shipping and mariners; extend
navigation; cut off all communication between France
and Canada by the river St. Laurence; so that Quebeck
would fall of course into the hands of the English, who
might expel the French entirely from America, open a
correspondence with the remote Indians, and render them∣selves
masters of the profitable fur-trade, which was now
engrossed by the enemy. The natives of New-England
acquired great glory from the success of this enterprise
Britain, which had in some instances behaved like a
stepmother to her own colonies, was now convinced of
their importance; and treated those as brethren whom she
had too long considered as aliens and rivals. Circum∣stanced
as the nation is, the legislature cannot too
tenderly cherish the interests of the British plantations
in America. They are inhabited by a brave, hardy, in∣dustrious
people, animated with an active spirit of com∣merce;
inspired with a noble zeal for liberty and inde∣pendence.
The trade of Great-Britain, clogged with
heavy taxes and impositions, has for some time languished
in many valuable branches. The French have undersold
our cloths, and spoiled our markets in the Levant. Spain
is no longer supplied as usual with the commodities of
England: the exports to Germany must be considerably
diminished by the misunderstanding between Great-Bri∣tain
and the house of Austria; consequently her greatest
resource must be in her communication with her own co∣lonies,
which consume her manufactures, and make im∣mense
returns in sugar, rum, tobacco, fish, timber, naval
stores, iron, furs, drugs, rice, and indigo. The southern
plantations likewise produce silk; and with due encourage∣ment
might furnish every thing that could be expected
from the most fertile soil and the happiest climate. The
continent of North-America, if properly cultivated, will
prove an inexhaustible fund of wealth and strength to
Great-Britain; and perhaps it may become the last asylum
of British liberty, when the nation is enslaved by do∣mestick
<PB N="144" REF="150"/>
despotism or foreign dominion; when her sub∣stance
is wasted, her spirit broke, and the laws and con∣stitution
of England are no more: then those colonies
sent off by our fathers, may receive and entertain thei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
sons as hapless exiles, and ruined refugees.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. While the continent of Europe and the
isles of America were thus exposed to the ravages of wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and subjected to such vicissitudes of fortune, Great-Bri∣tain
underwent a dangerous convulsion in her own
bowels. The son of the Chevalier de St. George, fire
with ambition, and animated with the hope of ascendin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the throne of his ancestors, resolved to make an effort <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
that purpose, which, though it might not be crowne
with success, should at least astonish all Christendo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
The Jacobites in England and Scotland had promise<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
that if he would land in Britain at the head of a regul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
army, they would supply him with provisions, carriage
and horses, and a great number of them declared the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
would take up arms, and join his standard: but they di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣approved
of his coming over without forces, as a dange∣rous
enterprise, that would in all probability end in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
ruin of himself and all his adherents. This advice, in∣cluding
an exact detail of his father's interest, with th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
dispositions of his particular friends in every town an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
county, was transmitted to London in January, in ord<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to be forwarded to Prince Charles; but the person wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
whom it was entrusted could find no safe method of con∣veyance;
so that he sent it back to Scotland, from whence
it was dispatched to France; but before it reached Pari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Charles had left that kingdom. Had the paper come t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his hands in due time, perhaps he would not have em∣barked
in the undertaking, though he was stimulated <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the attempt by many concurring motives. Certain it i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
he was cajoled by the sanguine misrepresentations of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
few adventurers, who hoped to profit by the expedition.
They assured him that the whole nation was disaffected to
the reigning family: that the people could no longer bea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the immense load of taxes, which was daily increasing; and
<PB N="145" REF="151"/>
that the most considerable persons of the kingdom would
gladly seise the first opportunity of crowding to his stan∣dard.
On the other hand, he knew the British govern∣ment
had taken some effectual steps to alienate the friends
of his house from the principles they had hitherto pro∣fessed.
Some of them had accepted posts and pensions:
others were preferred in the army; and the parliament
were so attached to the reigning family, that he had no∣thing
to hope from their deliberations. He expected no
material succour from the court of France: he foresaw
that delay would diminish the number of his adhe∣rents
in Great-Britain; and therefore, resolved to seise
the present occasion, which in many respect was propi∣tious
to his design. Without doubt, had he been properly
supported, he could not have found a more favourable
opportunity of exicting an intestine commotion in Great-Britain:
for Scotland was quite unfurnished with troops;
King George was in Germany; the Duke of Cumber∣land,
at the head of the British army, was employed in
Flanders, and great part of the Highlanders were keen for
insurrection. Their natural principles were on this occa∣sion
stimulated by the suggestions of revenge. At the
beginning of the war, a regiment of those people had
been formed, and transported with the rest of the British
troops to Flanders. Before they were embarked, a num∣ber
of them deserted with their arms, on pretence that
they had been decoyed into the service, by promises and
assurances that they should never be sent abroad; and
this was really the case. They were overtaken by a
body of horse, persuaded to submit, brought back to Lon∣don
pinioned like malefactors, and tried for desertion.
Three were shot to death <HI>in terrorem;</HI> and the rest were
sent in exile to the plantations. Those who suffered were
persons of some consequence in their own country; and
their fate was deeply resented by the clans to which
they belonged. It was considered as a national outrage;
and the Highlanders, who are naturally vindictive, waited
impatiently for an opportunity of vengeance.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="152"/>
§ XXVII. The young Pretender being furnished
with a sum of money, and a supply of arms, on his
private credit, without the knowledge of the French
court, wrote letters to his friends in Scotland, explaining
his design and situation, intimating the place where he
inteded to land, communicating a private signal, and
assuring them he should be with them by the middle of
June. These precautions being taken, he embarked on
board of a small frigate at Port St. Nazaire, accompanied
by the Marquis of Tullibardine, Sir Thomas Sheridan,
Sir John Macdonal, with a few other Irish and Scottish
adventurers; and setting sail on the fourteenth of July,
was joined off Belleisle by the Elisabeth, a French ship
of war, mounted with sixty-six guns, as his convoy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Elisabeth, a king's ship, was procured as a convoy, by the interest of Mr. Walsh, an Irish merchant at Nantes; and on board of her fifty <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> young gentlemen embarked as volunteers.</NOTE>.
Their design was to sail round Ireland, and land in the
western part of Scotland: but falling in with the Lion,
an English ship of the line, a very obstinate and
bloody action ensued. The Elisabeth was so disabled
that she could not prosecute the voyage, and with diffi∣culty
reached the harbour of Brest: but the Lion was
shattered to such a degree, that she floated like a wreck
upon the water. The desaster of the Elisabeth was a
great misfortune to the Adventurer, as by her being dis∣abled
he lost a great quantity of arms, and about one
hundred able officers, who were embarked on board of
her for the benefit of his expedition. Had this ship ar∣rived
in Scotland, she could easily have reduced Fort-William,
situated in the midst of the clans attached to
the Stuart family. Such a conquest, by giving lustre to
the Prince's arms, would have assured many to his stan∣dard,
who were indifferent in point of principle; and en∣couraged
a great number of Highlanders to join him,
who were restricted by the apprehension, that their wives
and families would be subject to insults from the English
garrison of this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortess. Prince Charles in the friga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="147" REF="153"/>
continued his course to the western isles of Scotland.
After a voyage of eighteen days he landed on a little island
between Barra and South Inst, two of the Hebrides:
then he re-marked, and in a few days arrived at Bora∣dale
in Arnsacy, on the confines of Lochnannach, where
he was in a little time joined by a considerable number
of hardy moutainers, under their respective chiefs or
leaders. On the nineteenth day of August, the Marquis
of Tullibardine erected the Pretender's standard at Glen∣sinnan.
Some of those, however, on whom Charles
principally depended, now stood aloof, either fluctuating
in their principles, astonished at the boldness of the un∣dertaking,
or startled at the remonstrances of their friends,
who did not fail to represent, in aggravated colours, all
the danger of embarking in such a desperate enterprise.
Had the government acted with proper vigour when they
received intelligence of his arrival, the Adventurer must
have been crushed in embrio, before any considerable num∣ber
of his adherents could have been brought together:
but the lords of the regency seemed to slight the infor∣mation,
and even to suspect the integrity of those by
whom it was conveyed. They were soon convinced of
their mistake. Prince Charles, having assembled about
twelve hundred men, encamped in the neighbourhood of
Fort-William; and immediately hostilities were com∣menced.
A handful of Keppoch's clan, commanded by
Major Donald Mac Donald, even before they joined the
Pretender, attacked two companies of new-raised soldiers,
who, with their officer, were disarmed after an obstinate
dispute: another captain of the King's forces, falling in∣to
their hands, was courteously dismissed with one of the
Pretender's manifestos, and a passport for his personal safe∣ty.
The administration was now effectually alarmed.
The lords of the regency issued a proclamation, offering
a reward of thirty thousand pounds to any person who
should apprehend the Prince-Adventurer. The same
price was set upon the head of the elector of Hanover,
in a proclamation published by the Pretender. A courier
<PB N="148" REF="154"/>
was dispatched to Holland, to hasten the return of his Ma∣jesty,
who arrived in England about the latter end of
August. A requisition was made of the six thousand
Dutch auxiliaries; and several British regiments were re∣called
from the Netherlands. A loyal address was pre∣sented
to the King by the city of London; and the mer∣chants
of this metropolis resolved to raise two regiments
at their own expense. Orders were issued to keep the
trained-bands in readiness; to array the militia of West∣minister;
and instructions to the same effect were sent
to all the lord-lieutenants of the counties through∣out
the kingdom. The principal noblemen of the nation
made a tender of their services to their sovereign; and
some of them received commissions to levy regiments to∣wards
the suppression of the rebellion. Bodies of volun∣teers
were incorporated in London, and many other
places; associations were formed, large contributions
raised in different towns, counties, and communities;
and a great number of eminent merchants in London
agreed to support the publick credit, by receiving, as usual,
Bank notes in payment, for the purposes of traffick. The
protestant clergy of all denominations exerted themselves
with extraordinary ardour, in preaching against the reli∣gion
of Rome and the Pretender; and the friends of the
government were encouraged, animated, and confirmed
in their principles, by several spiritual productions pub∣lished
for the occasion.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. In a word, the bulk of the nation seemed
unanimously bent upon opposing the enterprise of the
Pretender, who, nevertheless, had already made surprising
progress. His arrival in Scotland was no sooner con∣firmed,
than Sir John Cope, who commanded the troops
in that kingdom, assembled what force he could bring
together, and advanced against the rebels. Understanding,
however, that they had taken possession of a strong pass,
he changed his route, and proceeded northwards as far as
Inverness, leaving the capital and the southern parts of
North-Britain wholly exposed to the incursions of the
<PB N="149" REF="155"/>
enemy. The Highlanders forthwith marched to Perth,
where the Chavalier de St. George was proclaimed king
of Great-Britain, and the publick money seised for his
use: the same steps were taken at Dundee, and other
places. Prince Charles was joined by the nobleman
who assumed the title of Duke of Perth, the Vis∣count
Strathallan, Lord Nairn, Lord George Murray,
and many persons of distinction, with their followers.
The Marquis of Tullibardine, who had accompanied him
from France, took possession of Athol, as heir of blood
to the titles and estate which his younger brother enjoyed
in consequence of his attainder; and met with some suc∣cess
in arming the tenants for the support of that cause
which he avowed. The rebel army being considerably
augmented, though very ill provided with arms, crossed
the Forth in the neighbourhood of Stirling, and advanced
towards Edinburgh, where they were joined by Lord El∣cho,
son of the Earl of Wemys, and other persons of
some distinction. On the sixteenth day of September,
Charles summoned the town to surrender. The inhabi∣tants
were divided by faction, and distracted by fear: the
place was not in a posture of defence, and the magistrates
would not expose the people to the uncertain issue of an
assult. Several deputations were sent from the town to
the Pretender, in order to negociate terms of capitulation.
In the mean time, one of the gates being opened for
the admission of a coach, Cameron of Lochiel, one of
the most powerful of the highland chiefs, rushed into the
place with a party of his men, and secured it without
opposition. Next morning the whole rebel army entered,
and their prince took possession of the royal palace of
Holyrood-house, in the suburbs. Then he caused his
father to be proclaimed at the market-cross: there also
the manifesto was read, in which the Chevalier de St.
George declared his son Charles regent of his dominions,
promised to dissolve the Union, and redress the grievances
of Scotland. His being in possession of the capital encou∣raged
his followers, and added reputation to his arms:
<PB N="150" REF="156"/>
but the treasure belonging to the two banks of that king∣dom
had been previously conveyed into the castle, a
strong fortress, with a good garrison, under the command
of General Guest, an old officer of experience and capa∣city.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. During these transactions, Sir John Cope
marched back from Inverness to Aberdeen, where he em∣barked
with his troops, and on the seventeenth day of
September landed at Dunbar, about twenty miles to the
eastward of Edinburgh. Here he was joined by two regi∣ments
of dragoons, which had retired with precipitation
from the capital at the approach of the Highland army.
With this re-enforcement, his troops amounted to
near three thousand men; and he began his march to
Edinburgh, in order to give battle to the enemy. On
the twentieth day of the month, he encamped in the
neighbourhood of Preston-pans, having the village of
Tranent in his front, and the sea in his rear. Early next
morning he was attacked by the young Pretender, at the
head of about two thousand four hundred Highlanders
half-armed, who charged him sword in hand with such
impetuosity, that in less than ten minutes after the battle
began the King's troops were broken and totally routed.
The dragoons sled in the utmost confusion at the first
onset: the general officers having made some unsuccessful
efforts to rally them, thought proper to consult their own
safety by an expeditious retreat towards Coldstream on the
Tweed. All the infantry were either killed or taken;
and the colours, artillery, tents, baggage, and military
chest, fell into the hands of the victor, who returned
in triumph to Edinburgh. Never was victory more com∣plete,
or obtained at a smaller expense; for not above
fifty of the rebels lost their lives in the engagement.
Five hundred of the King's troops were killed on the
field of battle; and among these Colonel Gardiner, a
gallant officer, who disdained to save his life at the ex∣pense
of his honour. When abandoned by his own re∣giment
of dragoons, he alighted from his horse, joined
<PB N="151" REF="157"/>
the infantry, and fought on foot, until he fell covered
with wounds, in sight of his own threshold. Prince
Charles bore his good fortune with moderation. He pro∣hibited
all rejoicings for the victory he had obtained:
the wounded soldiers were treated with humanity; and
the officers were sent into Fife and Angus, where they
were left at liberty on their parole, which the greater
part of them shamefully broke in the sequel. From this
victory the Pretender reaped manifold and important ad∣vantages.
His followers were armed, his party encou∣raged,
and his enemies intimidated. He was supplied
with a train of field-artillery, and a consierable sum of
money, and saw himself possessed of all Scotland, except
the fortresses, the reduction of which he could not pre∣tend
to undertake without proper implements and engi∣neers.
After the battle he was joined by a small detach∣ment
from the Highlands; and some chiefs, who had hi∣therto
been on the reserve, began to exert their influence
in his favour. But he was not yet in a condition to take
advantage of that consternation which his late success
had diffused through the kingdom of England.</P>
<P>§ XXX. Charles continued to reside in the palace of
Holyrood-house<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">While he resided at Edinburgh, some of the presbyterian clergy conti∣nued to preach in the churches of that city, and publickly prayed for King George, without suffering the least punishment or molestation. One minister in particular, of the name of Mac Vicar, being sollicited by some Highlanders to pray for their prince, promised to comply with their re∣quest, and performed his promise in words to this effect: “And as for the young prince, who is come hither in quest of an earthly crown, grant, O Lord, that he may speedily receive a crown of glory.”.</NOTE>: and took measures for cutting off
the communication between the castle and the city. Ge∣neral
Guest declared that he would demolish the city,
unless the blockade should be raised, so as that provision
might be carried into the castle. After having waited
the return of an express which he had found means to
dispatch to court, he began to put his threats in execu∣tion,
by firing upon the town. Some houses were beaten
down, and several persons killed even at the market-cross.
<PB N="152" REF="158"/>
The citizens, alarmed at this disaster, sent a deputation
to the prince, entreating him to raise the blockade; and
he complied with their request. He levied a regiment in
Edinburgh and the neighbourhood. He imposed taxes;
seised the merchandise that was deposited in the King's
warehouses at Leith, and other palces; and complled
the city of Glasgow to accommodate him with a large
sum, to be repaid when the peace of the kingdom should
be re-established. The number of his followers daily
increased: and he received considerable supplies of money,
artillery, and ammunition, by single ships that arrived
from France, where his interest seemed to rise in propor∣tion
to the success of his arms. The greater and richer
part of Scotland was averse to his family and preten∣sions:
but the people were unarmed and undisciplined,
consequently passive under his dominion. By this time,
however, the Prince-Pretender was joined by the Earl of
Kilmarnock, the Lords Elcho, Balmerino, Ogilvy, Pit∣sligo;
and the eldest son of Lord Lovat had begun to
assemble his father's clan, in order to re-enforce the vic∣tor,
whose army lay encamped at Duddingston, in the
neighbourhood of Edinburgh. Kilmarnock and Balme∣rino
were men of broken and desperate fortune: Elcho
and Ogilvy were sons to the Earls of Wemys and Arily;
so that their influence was far from being extensive.
Pitsligo was a nobleman of a very amiable character, as
well as of great personal interest; and great dependence
was placed upon the power and attachment of Lord Lo∣vat,
who had entered into private engagements with the
Chevalier de St. George, though he still wore the mark
of loyalty to the government, and disavowed the conduct
of his son when he declared for the Pretender. This old
nobleman is the same Simon Fraser whom we have had
occasion to mention as a partisan and emissary of the
court of St. Germain's in the year one thousand seven
hundred and three. He had renounced his connexions
with that family; and, in the rebellion immediately after
the accession of King George I. approved himself a warm
<PB N="153" REF="159"/>
friend to the protestant succession. Since that period he
had been induced, by disgust and ambition, to change his
principles again, and was in secret an enthusiast in ja∣cobitism.
He had greatly augmented his estate, and ob∣tained
a considerable interest in the Highlands, where,
however, he was rather dreaded than beloved. He was
bold, enterprising, vain, arbitary, rapacious, cruel, and
deceitful: but his character was chiefly marked by a
species of low cunning and dissimulation, which, how∣ever,
overshot his purpose, and contributed to his own
ruin. While Charles resided at Edinburgh, the Mar∣quis
de Guilles arrived at Montrose, as envoy from the
French King, with several officers, some cannon, and
a considerable quantity of small arms for the use of that
adventurer<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He sollicited, and is said to have obtained of the Chevalier de St. George, the patent of a duke, and a commission for being lord-lieutenant <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f all Highlands.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. While the young Pretender endeavoured
to improve the advantages he had gained, the ministry
of Great-Britain took every possible measure to retard his
progress. Several powerful chiefs in the Highlands were
attached to the government, and exerted themselves in its
defence. The Duke of Argyle began to arm his vassals;
but, not before he had obtained the sanction of the le∣gislature.
Twelve hundred men were raised by the
Earl of Sutherland: the Lord Rae brought a consider∣able
number to the field: the Grants and Monores
appeared under their respective leaders for the service
of his Majesty: Sir Alexander Macdonald declared
or King George, and the Laird of Macleod sent two
thousand hardy islanders from Skie, to strengthen the
same interest. These gentlemen, though supposed to
be otherwise affected, were governed and directed by
the advice of Duncan Forbes, president of the College of
Justice at Edinburgh; a man of extensive knowledge,
agreeable manners, and unblemished integrity. He
procured commissions for raising twenty independent
<PB N="154" REF="160"/>
companies, and some of these he bestowed upon indivi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>duals
who were either attached by principle, or engage<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
by promise, to the Pretender. He acted with indefatiga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble
zeal for the interest of the reigning family; and great<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly
injured an opulent fortune in their service. He con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>firmed
several chiefs who began to waver in their princi¦ples:
some he actually converted by the energy of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
arguments, and brought over to the assistance of the go<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vernment,
which they had determined to oppose: other<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
he persuaded to remain quiet, without taking any sha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
in the present troubles. Certain it is, this gentleman,
by his industry and address, prevented the insurrection o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ten
thousand Highlanders, who would otherwise have
joined the Pretender; and, therefore, he may be said to
have been one great cause of that Adventurer's miscarriage▪
The Earl of London repaired to Inverness, where he
completed his regiment of Highlanders; directed the
conduct of the clans who had taken arms in behalf o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his Majesty; and, by his vigilance, overawed the disaf∣fected
chieftains of that country, who had not yet open∣ly
engaged in the rebellion. Immediately after the defea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of Cope, six thousand Dutch troops<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">They were composed of the forces who had been in garrison at Tournay and Dendermonde when those places were taken, and engaged by capitulation, that they should not perform any military function before the first day of January in the year 1747; so they could not have acted in England without the infringement of a solemn treaty.</NOTE> arrived in England,
and three battalions of guards, with seven regiments of
infantry, were recalled from Flanders, for the defence of
the kingdom. They forthwith began their march to the
North, under the command of General Wade, who re∣ceived
orders to assemble an army, which proceeded to
Newcastle. The parliament meeting on the sixteenth day
of October, his Majesty gave them to understand, that
an unnatural rebellion had broke out in Scotland, towards
the suppression of which he craved their advice and as∣sistance.
He found both Houses cordial in their addresses,
and zealous in their attachment to his person and govern∣ment.
The Commons forthwith suspended the Habeas
<PB N="155" REF="161"/>
Corpus act; and several persons were apprehended on
suspicion of treasonable practices. Immediately after the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ession was opened the Duke of Cumberland arrived from
the Netherlands, and was followed by another detach∣ment
of dragoons and infantry. The trained-bands of
London were reviewed by his Majesty: the county regi∣ments
were completed: the volunteers, in different parts
of the kingdom, employed themselves industriously in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xercise of arms; and the whole English nation seemed to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se up as one man against this formidable invader. The
government being apprehensive of a descent from France,
appointed Admiral Vernon to command a squadron in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Downs, to observe the motions of the enemy by sea,
specially in the harbours of Dunkirk and Boulogn; and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is cruisers took several ships laden with soldiers, officers,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd ammunition, destined for the service of the Pretender
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Scotland.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. This enterprising youth, having collected
about five thousand men, resolved to make an irruption
into England, which he accordingly entered by the west
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>order on the sixth day of November. Carlisle was in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ested,
and in less than three days surrendered: the keys
were delivered to him at Brampton, by the mayor and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ldermen on their knees. Here he found a considerable
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uantity of arms: his father was proclaimed king of
Great-Britain, and himself regent; by the magistrates
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n their formalities. General Wade being apprised of
his progress, decamped from Newcastle, and advanced
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cross the country as far as Hexham, though the fields
were covered with snow, and the roads almost impassable.
There he received intelligence that Carlisle was reduced,
and forthwith returned to his former station. In the
mean time, orders were issued for assembling another ar∣my
in Staffordshire, under the command of Sir John Li∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gonier.
Prince Charles, notwithstanding this formidable
opposition, determined to proceed. He had received assu∣rances
from France, that a considerable body of troops
would be landed on the southern coast of Britain, to make
<PB N="156" REF="162"/>
a diversion in his favour; and he never doubted but that
he should be joined by all the English malcontents, as
soon as he could penetrate into the heart of the kingdom▪
Leaving a small garrison in the castle of Carlisle, he ad∣vanced
to Penrith, marching on foot in the Highland
garb, at the head of his forces; and continued his route
through Lancaster and Preston to Manchester, where, on
the twenty-ninth day of the month, he established his
head-quarters. There he was joined by about two hun∣dred
Englishmen, who were formed into a regiment, un∣der
the command of Colonel Townley. The inhabitants
seemed to receive him with marks of affection; and his
arrival was celebrated by illuminations, and other publick
rejoicings. His supposed intention was to prosecute his
march by the way of Chester into Wales, where he hoped
to find a great number of adherents: but all the bridges
over the river Mersey being broken down, he chose the
route to Stockport, and forded the river at the head of
his division, though the water rose to his middle. He
passed through Macclesfield and Congleton; and on the
fourth day of December entered the town of Derby, in
which his army was quartered, and his father proclaimed
with great formality. He had now advanced within one
hundred miles of the capital, which was filled with ter∣rour
and confusion. Wade lingered in Yorkshire: the
Duke of Cumberland had assumed the command of the
other army assembled in the neighbourhood of Lichfield.
He had marched from Stafford to Stone; so that the re∣bels,
in turning off by Ashborne to Derby, had gained a
march between him and London. Had Charles proceeded
in his career with that expedition which he had hitherto
used, he might have made himself master of the metro∣polis,
where he would have been certainly joined by a
considerable number of his well-wishers, who waited im∣patiently
for his approach: yet this exploit could not
have been atchieved without hazarding an engagement,
and running the risque of being enclosed within three ar∣mies,
each greatly superior to his own in number and
<PB N="157" REF="163"/>
artillery. Orders were given for forming a camp on
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nchley-common, where the King resolved to take the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eld in person, accompanied by the Earl of Stair, field-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>areschal
and commander in chief of the forces in South-Britain.
Some Romish priests were apprehended: the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilitia of London and Middlesex were kept in readiness
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> march: double watches were posted at the city-gates,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd signals of alarm appointed. The volunteers of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity were incorporated into a regiment: the practitioners
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the law, headed by the judges, the weavers of Spital-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>elds,
and other communities, engaged in associations;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd even the managers of the theatres offered to raise a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ody of their dependents for the service of the govern∣ment.
Notwithstanding these precautions and appear∣ances
of unanimity, the trading part of the city, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose concerned in the money-corporations, were over∣whelmed
with fear and dejection. They reposed very
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ttle confidence in the courage or discipline of their mi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tia
and volunteers: they had received intelligence that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he French were employed in making preparations at
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unkirk and Calais for a descent upon England: they
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>readed an insurrection of the Roman Catholics, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther friends of the house of Stuart; and they reflected
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat the Highlanders, of whom by this time they had
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onceived a most terrible idea, were within four days
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arch of the capital. Alarmed by these considerations,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey prognosticated their own ruin in the approaching
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evolution; and their countenances exhibited the plainest
marks of horrour and despair. On the other hand, the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acobites were elevated to an insolence of hope, which
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey were at no pains to conceal; while many people,
who had no private property to lose, and thought no
change would be for the worse, waited the issue of this
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>risis with the most calm indifference.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. This state of suspense was of short dura∣tion.
The young Pretender found himself miserably dis∣appointed
in his expectations. He had now advanced in∣to
the middle of the kingdom, and except a few that
<PB N="158" REF="164"/>
joined him at Manchester, not a soul appeared in his be∣half:
one would have imagined that all the Jacobites of
England had been annihilated. The Welch took no step
to excite an insurrection in his favour: the French made
no attempt towards an invasion; his court was divided
into factions: the Highland chiefs began to murmur, and
their clans to be unruly: he saw himself with a handful
of men hemmed in between two considerable armies, in
the middle of winter, and in a country disaffected to his
cause. He knew he could not proceed to the metropo∣lis
without hazarding a battle, and that a defeat would
be attended with the inevitable destruction of himself and
all his adherents; and he had received information that
his friends and officers had assembled a body of forces in
the North, superior in number to those by whom he was
attended. He called a council at Derby: and proposed
to advance towards London: the proposal was supported
by Lord Nairn with great vehemence: but, after violent
disputes, the majority determined that they should re∣treat
to Scotland with all possible expedition. Accord∣ingly,
they abandoned Derby on the sixth day of Decem∣ber,
early in the morning, and measured back the route
by which they had advanced. On the ninth their van∣guard
arrived at Manchester: on the twelfth they entered
Preston, and continued their march northwards. The
Duke of Cumberland, who was encamped at Meriden,
when first apprised of their retreat, detached the horse
and dragoons in pursuit of them; while General Wade
began his march from Ferrybridge into Lancashire, with
a view of intercepting them in their route: but at Wake∣field
he understood that they had already reached Wigan:
he, therefore, repaired to his old post at Newcastle, after
having detached General Oglethorpe, with his horse and
dragoons, to join those who had been sent off from the
Duke's army. They pursued with such alacrity, that
they overtook the rear of the rebels, with which they
skirmished, in Lancashire. The militia of Cumberland
and Westmorland were raised and armed by the Duke's
<PB N="159" REF="165"/>
order, to harrass them in their march. The bridges were
broken down, the roads damaged, and the beacons lighted
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> alarm the country. Nevertheless, they retreated re∣gularly
with their small train of artillery. They were
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vertaken at the village of Clifton, in the neighbourhood
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Penrith, by two regiments of dragoons. These alighted,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd lined the hedges, in order to harrass part of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nemy's rear-guard, commanded by Lord John Murray;
who, at the head of the Macphersons, attacked the
dragoons sword in hand, and repulsed them with some loss.
On the nineteenth day of the month, the Highland army
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eached Carlisle, where the majority of the English in
the service of the Pretender were left, at their own de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire.
Charles, having re-enforced the garrison of the
place, crossed the rivers Eden and Solway into Scotland,
having thus accomplished one of the most surprising retreats
that ever was performed. But the most remarkable cir∣cumstance
of this expedition, was the moderation and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egularity with which those ferocious people conducted
themselves in a country abounding with plunder. No
violence was offered; no outrage committed; and they
were effectually restrained from the exercise of rapine.
Notwithstanding the excessive cold, the hunger, and fatigue
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o which they must have been exposed, they left behind
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o sick, and lost a very few stragglers; but retired with
deliberation, and carried off their cannon in the face of
their enemy. The Duke of Cumberland invested Car∣lisle
with his whole army on the twenty-first day of De∣cember,
and on the thirtieth the garrison surrendered on
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sort of capitulation made with the Duke of Richmond.
The prisoners, amounting to about four hundred, were
imprisoned in different gaols in England, and the Duke
returned to London.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. The Pretender proceeded by the way of
Dumfries to Glasgow, from which last city he exacted
severe contributions, on account of its attachment to the
government, for whose service it had raised a regiment
of nine hundred men, under the command of the Earl of
<PB N="160" REF="166"/>
Home. Having continued several days at Glasgow, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
advanced towards Stirling, and was joined by some
forces which had been assembled in his absence by Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Lewis Gordon and John Drummond, brothers to the
Dukes of Gordon and Perth. This last nobleman had
arrived from France in November, with a small re-en∣forcement
of French and Irish, and a commission as ge∣neral
of these auxiliaries. He fixed his head-quarters a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Perth, where he was re-enforced by the Earl of Cro∣martie,
and other clans, to the number of two thousand
and he was accommodated with a small train of artillery.
They had found means to surprise a sloop of war at Mon∣trose,
with the guns of which they fortified that harbour▪
They had received a considerable sum of money from Spain.
They took possession of Dundee, Dumblaine, Down∣castle,
and laid Fife under contribution. The Earl of
London remained at Inverness, with about two thousand<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Highlanders in the service of his Majesty. He convoyed
provisions to Fort-Augustus and Fort-William: he se∣cured
the person of Lord Lovat, who still temporised
and at length this cunning veteran accomplished his escape<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪
The Laird of Macleod, and Mr. Monro of Culcaira<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
being detached from Inverness towards Aberdeenshire
were surprised and routed by Lord Lewis Gordon at Inve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣rary;
and that interest seemed to preponderate in the
north of Scotland. Prince Charles being joined by Lord
John Drummond, invested the castle of Stirling, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
which General Blakeney commanded: but, his people
were so little used to enterprises of this kind, that they
made very little progress in their operations.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. By this time, a considerable body of force
was assembled at Edinburgh, under the conduct of Ge∣neral
Hawley, who determined to relieve Stirling-castle
and advanced to Linlithgow on the thirteenth day of Ja∣nuary:
next day his whole army rendezvoused at Falkir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
while the rebels were cantoned about Bannockburn. O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the seventeenth day of the month, they began the
march in two columns to attack the King's forces, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="161" REF="167"/>
had forded the water of Carven, within three miles of
Hawley's camp, before he discovered their intention.
Such was his obstinacy, self conceit, or contempt of
the enemy, that he slighted the repeated intelligence he
had received of their motions and design, firmly believing
they durst not hazard an engagement. At length, per∣ceiving
they had occupied the rising ground to the south∣ward
of Falkirk, he ordered his cavalry to advance, and
drive them from the eminence; while his infantry form∣ed,
and were drawn up in order of battle. The High∣landers
kept up their fire, and took aim so well, that the
assailants were broke by the first volley: they retreated
with precipitation, and fell in amongst the infantry,
which were likewise discomposed by the wind and rain
beating with great violence in their faces, wetting their
powder, and disturbing their eye-sight. Some of the
dragoons rallied, and advanced again to the charge, with
part of the infantry which had not been engaged:
then the Pretender marched up at the head of his corps
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reserve, consisting of the regiment of Lord John Drum∣mond,
and the Irish piqu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts. These, re-enforcing the
Camerons and the Stuarts in the front line, immediately
obliged the dragoons to give way a second time; and
they again disordered the foot in their retreat. They set
fire to their camp, and abandoned Falkirk with their

<P>§ XXXVI. General Hawley, who had boasted that,
with two regiments of dragoons, he would drive the rebel
army from one end of the kingdom to the other, incurred
abundance of censure for the disposition he made, as well as
for his conduct before and after the action: but he found
means to vindicate himself to the satisfaction of his sove∣reign.
Nevertheless, it was judged necessary that the
army in Scotland should be commanded by a general in
whom the soldiers might have some confidence; and the
Duke of Cumberland was chosen for this purpose. Over
and above his being beloved by the army, it was suggested,
that the appearance of a prince of the blood in Scot∣land
might have a favourable effect upon the minds of
people in that kingdom: he, therefore, began to prepare
for his northern expedition. Mean while, the French
minister at the Hague having represented to the States-General,
that the auxiliaries which they had sent into
Great-Britain were part of the garrisons of Tournay
and Dendermonde, and restricted by the capitulation from
bearing arms against France for a certain term, the
States thought proper to recall them, rather than come to
an open rupture with his Most Christian Majesty. In
the room of those troops six thousand Hessians were trans∣ported
from Flanders to Leith, where they arrived in the
beginning of February, under the command of their
prince, Frederick of Hesse, son-in-law to his Britan∣nick
majesty. By this time the Duke of Cumberland had
put himself at the head of the troops in Edinburgh, con∣sisting
of fourteen battalions of infantry, two regiments
of dragoons, and twelve hundred Highlanders from Ar∣gyleshire,
<PB N="163" REF="169"/>
under the command of Colonel Campbell.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VIII. 1746.</NOTE> On
the last day of January, his royal higness began his
march to Linlithgow; and the enemy, who had renewed
the siege of Stirling-castle, not only abandoned that en∣terprise,
but crossed the river Forth with precipitation.
Their prince found great difficulty in maintaining his
forces, that part of the country being quite exhausted.
He hoped to be re-enforced in the Highlands, and to re∣ceive
supplies of all kinds from France and Spain: he,
therefore, retired by Badenoch towards Inverness, which
the Earl of Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>don abandoned at his approach. The fort
was surrendered to him almost without opposition, and
here he fixed his head quarters. His next exploit was the
siege of Fort-Augustus, which he in a little time reduced.
The Duke of Cumberland having secured the important
posts of Stirling and Perth, with the Hessian battalions,
advanced with the army to Aberdeen, where he was
joined by the Duke of Gordon, the Earls of Aberdeen
and Findlater, the Laird of Grant, and other persons of
distinction.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. While he remained in this place, re∣freshing
his troops, and preparing magazines, a party of
the rebels surprised a detachment of Kingston's horse,
and about seventy Argyleshire Highlanders, at Keith, who
were either killed or taken. Several advanced parties of
that militia met with the same fate in different places.
Lord George Murray invested the castle of Blair, which
was defended by Sir Andrew Agnew, until a body of
Hessians marched to its relief, and obliged the rebels to
retire. The Prince-Pretender ordered all his forces to
assemble, in order to begin their march for Aberdeen, to
attack the Duke of Cumberland: but, in consequence of
a remonstrance from the clans, who declined leaving
their families at the mercy of the King's garrison in Fort-William,
he resolved previously to reduce that fortress,
the siege of which was undertaken by Brigadier Stapleton,
an engineer in the French service: but the place was
so vigorously maintained by Captain Scot, that in the
<PB N="164" REF="170"/>
beginning of April they thought proper to relinquish the
enterprise.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1746.</NOTE> The Earl of London had retired into Suther∣land,
and taken post at Dornoch, where his quarters
were beat up by a strong detachment of the rebels, com∣manded
by the Duke of Perth: a major and sixty men
were taken prisoners; and the Earl was obliged to take
shelter in the Isle of Skye. These little checks were
counter-balanced by some advantages which his Majesty's
arms obtained. The sloop of war which the rebels had
surprised at Montrose was re-taken in Sutherland, with
a considerable sum of money, and a great quantity of
arms on board, which she had brought from France for
the use of the Pretender. In the same county, the Earl of
Cromartie fell into an ambuscade, and was taken by the
militia of Sutherland, who likewise defeated a body of
the rebels at Goldspie. This action happened on the
very day which has been rendered famous by the victory
obtained at Culloden.</P>

<P>§ I. IN the beginning of April the Duke of Cumber∣land
began his march from Aberdeen; and on the
twelfth passed the deep and rapid river Spey, without op∣position
from the rebels, though a detachment of them ap∣peared
on the opposite side. Why they did not dispute the
passage is not easy to be conceived: but, indeed, from
this instance of neglect, and their subsequent conduct, we
may conclude they were under a total infatuation. His
royal highness proceeded to Nairn, where he received in∣telligence,
that the enemy had advanced from Inverness to
Culloden, about the distance of nine miles from the royal
army, with intention to give him battle. The design of
Charles, was to march in the night from Culloden, and
surprise the Duke's army at day-break: for this purpose
the English camp had been reconnoitred; and on the
night of the fifteenth the Highland army began to march
in two columns. Their design was to surround the ene∣my,
and attack them at once on all quarters: but the
length of the columns embarrassed the march, so that the
army was obliged to make many halts: the men had been
under arms during the whole preceding night, were faint
with hunger and fatigue, and many of them overpowered
with sleep. Some were unable to proceed: others dropped
off unperceived in the dark; and the march was retarded
in such a manner, that it would have been impossible to
reach the Duke's camp before sun-rise. The design being
thus frustrated, the Prince-Pretender was with great re∣luctance
prevailed upon by his general officers to measure
back his way to Culloden; at which place he had no sooner
arrived, than great numbers of his followers dispersed in
quest of provision; and many, overcome with weariness and
<PB N="167" REF="173"/>
sleep, threw themselves down on the heath, and along the
park walls. Their repose, however, was soon interrupted
in a very disagreeable manner. Their prince receiving
intelligence that his enemies were in full march to attack
him, resolved to hazard an engagement, and ordered his
troops to be formed for that purpose. On the sixteenth
day of April, the Duke of Cumberland having made the
proper dispositions, decamped from Nairn early in the
morning, and after a march of nine miles perceived the
Highlanders drawn up in order of battle, to the number of
four thousand men, in thirteen divisions, supplied with
some pieces of artillery. The royal army, which was
much more numerous, the Duke immediately formed into
three lines, disposed in excellent order; and about one
o'clock in the afternoon the cannonading began. The ar∣tillery
of the rebels was ill served, and did very little ex∣ecution:
but that of the King's troops made dreadful ha∣vock
among the enemy. Impatient of this fire, their front∣line
advanced to the attack, and about five hundred of the
clans charged the Duke's left wing with their usual impe∣tuosity.
One regiment was disordered by the weight of this
column: but two battalions advancing from the second
line, sustained the first, and soon put a stop to their career,
by a severe fire, that killed a great number. At the same
time, the dragoons under Hawley, and the Argyleshire
militia, pulled down a park-wall that covered their right
slank, and the cavalry falling in among the rebels, sword
in hand, completed their confusion. The French piquets
on their left covered the retreat of the Highlanders by a
close and regular fire; and then retired to Inverness, where
they surrendered themselves prisoners of war. An entire
body of the rebels marched off the field in order, with their
pipes playing, and the Pretender's standard displayed: the
rest were routed with great slaughter; and their prince
was with reluctance prevailed upon to retire. In less than
thirty minutes, they were totally defeated, and the field co∣vered
with the slain. The road, as far as Inverness, was
strewed with dead bodies; and a good number of people,
<PB N="168" REF="174"/>
who, from motives of curiosity, had come to see the battle,
were sacrificed to the undistinguishing vengeance of the
victors. Twelve hundred rebels were slain or wounded on
the field, and in the pursuit. The Earl of Kilmarnock
was taken; and in a few days Lord Balmerino surrender∣ed
to a country gentleman, at whose house he presented
himself for this purpose. The glory of the victory was sul∣lied
by the barbarity of the soldiers. They had been pro∣voked
by their former disgraces to the most savage thirst
of revenge. Not contented with the blood which was so pro∣fusely
shed in the heat of action, they traversed the field
after the battle, and massacred those miserable wretches
who lay maimed and expiring; nay, some officers acted a
part in this cruel scene of assassination: the triumph of
low illiberal minds, uninspired by sentiment, untinctured
by humanity. The vanquished adventurer rode off the
field, accompanied by the Duke of Perth, Lord Elcho,
and a few horsemen: he crossed the water of Nairn, and
retired to the house of a gentleman in Strutharrick, where
he conferred with old Lord Lovat: then he dismissed his
followers, and wandered about a wretched and solitary fu∣gitive
among the isles and mountains, for the space of five
months, during which he underwent such a series of dan∣gers,
hardships, and misery, as no other person ever out∣lived.
Thus, in one short hour, all his hope vanished, and
the rebellion was entirely extinguished. One would al∣most
imagine the conductors of this desperate enterprise
had conspired their own destruction, as they certainly ne∣glected
every step that might have contributed to their safe∣ty
or success. They might have opposed the Duke of
Cumberland at the passage of the Spey; they might, by
proper conduct, have afterwards attacked his camp in the
night, with a good prospect of success. As they were
greatly inferior to him in number, and weakened with
hunger and fatigue, they might have retired to the hills
and fastnesses where they would have found plenty of live
cattle for provision, recruited their regiments, and been
joined by a strong re-enforcement, which was actually in
<PB N="169" REF="175"/>
all march to their assistance. But they were distracted by
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssentions and jealousies: they obeyed the dictates of de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>air,
and wilfully devoted themselves to ruin and death.
When the news of the battle arrived in England, the na∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on
was transported with joy, and extolled the Duke of
Cumberland as a hero and deliverer. Both Houses of par∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ament
congratulated his Majesty on the auspicious event.
They decreed, in the most solemn manner, their publick
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hanks to his royal highness, which were transmitted to
him by the Speakers; and the Commons, by bill, added
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive-and twenty thousand pounds per annum to his former
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evenue.</P>
<P>§ II. Immediately after the decisive action at Culloden,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Duke took possession of Inverness, where six-and-thirty
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eserters, convicted by a court-martial, were ordered to be
executed: then he detached several parties to ravage the
country. One of these apprehended the Lady Mackintosh,
who was sent prisoner to Inverness. They did not plun∣der
her house, but drove away her cattle, though her hus∣band
was actually in the service of government. The cas∣tle
of Lord Lovat was destroyed. The French prisoners
were sent to Carlisle and Penrith: Kilmarnock, Balmeri∣no,
Cromartie, and his son, the Lord Macleod, were con∣veyed
by sea to London; and those of an inferior rank were
confined in different prisons. The Marquis of Tullibar∣dine,
together with a brother of the Earl of Dunmore,
were seised, and transported to the Tower of London, to
which the Earl of Tranquair had been committed on suspi∣cion:
in a few months after the battle of Culloden, Murray,
the Pretender's secretary, was apprehended: and the eldest
son of Lord Lovat, having surrendered himself, was impri∣soned
in the castle of Edinburgh. In a word, all the jails
of Great-Britain, from the capital northwards, were filled
with those unfortunate captives; and great numbers of
them were crowded together in the holds of ships, where
they perished in the most deplorable manner, for want of
necessaries, air, and exercise. Some rebel chiefs escaped
in two French frigates which had arrived on the coast of
<PB N="170" REF="176"/>
Lochaber about the end of April, and engaged three
vessels belonging to his Britannick Majesty, which they
obliged to retire. Others embarked on board of a ship
on the coast of Buchan; and were conveyed to Norway,
from whence they travelled to Sweden. In the month
of May, the Duke of Cumberland advanced with the
army into the Highlands, as far as Fort-Augustus, where
he encamped; and sent off detachments on all hands, to
hunt down the fugitives, and lay waste the country with
fire and sword. The castles of Glengary and Lochiel
were plundered and burned: every house, hut, or habi∣tation,
met with the same fate, without distinction: all
the cattle and provision were carried off: the men were
either shot upon the mountains, like wild beasts, or pu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to death in cold blood, without form of trial: the wo∣men,
after having seen their husbands and fathers mur∣dered,
were subjected to brutal violation, and then turne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
out naked, with their children, to starve on the barre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
heaths. One whole family was enclosed in a barn, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
consumed to ashes. Those ministers of vengeance we<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
so alert in the execution of their office, that in a few
days there was neither house, cottage, man, nor beast
to be seen in the compass of fifty miles: all was ruin
silence, and desolation.</P>
<P>§ III. The humane reader cannot reflect upon such<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
scene without grief and horror: what then must have
been the sensation of the fugitive prince, when he beheld
these spectacles of woe, the dismal fruit of his ambition▪
He was now surrounded by armed troops, that chase<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
him from hill to dale, from rock to cavern, and from
shore to shore. Sometimes he lurked in caves and cottages
without attendants, or any other support but that which the
poorest peasant could supply. Sometimes he was rowed i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
fisher-boats from isle to isle, among the Hebrides, and often
in sight of his pursuers. For some days he appeared in
woman's attire, and even passed through the midst of his
enemies unknown. But, understanding his disguise was
discovered, he assumed the habit of a travelling moun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>neer,
<PB N="171" REF="177"/>
and wandered about among the woods and heaths,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a matted beard and squalid looks, exposed to hun∣ger,
thirst, and weariness, and in continual danger of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ng apprehended. He was obliged to trust his life to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fidelity of above fifty individuals, and many of these
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re in the lowest paths of fortune. They knew that a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce of thirty thousand pounds was set upon his head;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that, by betraying him, they should enjoy wealth and
influence: but they detested the thought of obtaining
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hes on such infamous terms, and ministered to his ne∣cessities,
with the utmost zeal and fidelity, even at the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>zard of their own destruction. In the course of these
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>regrinations, he was more than once hemmed in by his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rsuers, in such a manner as seemed to preclude all possi∣bility
of escaping: yet, he was never abandoned by his
hope and recollection: he still found some expedient that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ved him from captivity and death; and through the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hole course of his distresses maintained the most ama∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng
equanimity and good humour. At length a privateer
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> St. Malo, hired by the young Sheridan and some other
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ish adherents, arrived in Lochanannach; and on the
twentieth day of September this unfortunate prince em∣barked
in the habit which he wore for disguise. His
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was hollow, his visage wan, and his constitution
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ealty impaired by famine and fatigue. He was accom∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anied
by Cameron of Lochiel, and his brother, with a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> other exiles. They set sail for France, and after
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aving passed unseen, by means of a thick fog, through
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> British squadron commanded by Admiral Lestock, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>een chased by two English ships of war, arrived in safety
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Roseau, near Morlaix, in Bretagne. Perhaps he would
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave found it still more difficult to escape, had not the
vigilance and eagerness of the government been relaxed,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> consequence of a report, that he had already fallen
among some persons that were slain by a volley from one
of the Duke's detachments.</P>
<P>§ IV. Having thus explained the rise, progress, and
extinction of the rebellion, it will be necessary to take a
<PB N="172" REF="178"/>
retrospective view of the proceedings in parliament. The
necessary steps being taken for quieting the intestine com∣motions
of the kingdom, the two Houses began to con∣vert
their attention to the affairs of the continent. On
the fourteenth day of January, the King repaired to
the House of Peers, and in a speech from the throne
gave his parliament to understand, that the States-Gene∣ral
had made pressing instances for his assistance in the
present conjuncture, when they were in such danger of
being oppressed by the power of France in the Nether∣lands;
that he had promised to co-operate with them
towards opposing the further progress of their enemies;
and even concerted measures for that purpose. He de∣clared
it was with regret that he asked any further aids
of his people: he exhorted them to watch over the pub∣lick
credit; and expressed his entire dependence on their
zeal and unanimity. He was favoured with loyal ad∣dresses,
couched in the warmest terms of duty and af∣fection:
but the supplies were retarded by new convul∣sions
in the ministry. The Earl of G. had made an effort
to retrieve his influence in the cabinet, and his sovereign
favoured his pretensions. The two brothers, who knew
his aspiring genius, and dreaded his superior talents,
refused to admit such a colleague into the administration:
they even resolved to strengthen their party, by intro∣ducing
fresh auxiliaries into the offices of state. Some of
these were personally disagreeable to his Majesty, who
accordingly rejected the suit by which they were recom∣mended.
The Duke of Newcastle and his brother, with
all their adherents, immediately resigned their employ∣ments.
The Earl of Granville was appointed secretary
of state, and resumed the reins of administration: but,
finding himself unequal to the accumulated opposition
that preponderated against him; foreseeing that he should
not be able to secure the supplies in parliament; and
dreading the consequences of that confusion which his
restoration had already produced, he, in three days, vo∣luntarily
quitted the helm: and his Majesty acquiesced
<PB N="173" REF="179"/>
in the measures proposed by the opposite party. The
seals were re-delivered to the Duke of Newcastle and the
Earl of Harrington: Mr. Pelham, and all the rest who
had resigned, were reinstated in their respetive employ∣ments;
and offices were conferred on several individuals
who had never before been in the service of the govern∣ment.
William Pitt, Esq. was appointed vice-treasurer
of Ireland, and soon promoted to the place of paymaster-general
of the forces; at the same time the King de∣clared
him a privy-counsellor. This gentleman had been
originally designed for the army, in which he actually
bore a commission; but fate reserved him for a more im∣portant
station. In point of fortune he was barely quali∣fied
to be elected member of parliament, when he obtain∣ed
a seat in the House of Commons, where he soon out∣shone
all his compatriots. He displayed a surprising ex∣tent
and precision of political knowledge, an irresistible
energy of argument, and such powers of elocution, as
struck his hearers with astonishment and admiration. It
flashed like the lightning of heaven against the ministers
and sons of corruption, blasting where it smote, and wi∣thering
the nerves of opposition: but his more substantial
praise was founded upon his disinterested integrity, his
incorruptible heart, his unconquerable spirit of indepen∣dence,
and his invariable attachment to the interest and
liberty of his country.</P>
<P>§ V. The quiet of the ministry being re-established, the
House of Commons provided for forty thousand seamen,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>early the same number of land forces, besides fifteen regi∣ments
raised by the nobility, on account of the rebellion,
and about twelve thousand marines. They settled funds for
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he maintenance of the Dutch and Hessian troops that
were in England, as well as for the subsidy to the Land-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rave.
They granted three hundred thousand pounds to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> King of Sardinia; four hundred thousand pounds to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Queen of Hungary; three hundred and ten thousand
pounds to defray the expense of eighteen thousand Ha∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>overians;
about three-and-thirty thousand pounds in sub∣sidies
<PB N="174" REF="180"/>
to the Electors of Mentz and Cologn; and five
hundred thousand pounds in a vote of credit and confidence
to his Majesty. The whole charge of the current year
amounted to seven millions two hundred and fifty thousand
pounds, which was raised by the land and malt-taxes
annuities on the additional duties imposed on glass, and spi∣rituous
liquors, a lottery, a deduction from the sinking
fund, and exchequer bills, chargeable on the first aids that
should be granted in the next session of parliament.</P>
<P>§ VI. The rebellion being quelled, the legislature re∣solved
to make examples of those who had been concerne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in disturbing the peace of their country. In June an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
of attainder was passed against the principal persons who
had embarked in that desparate undertaking; and cour<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
were opened in different parts of England, for the trial
of the prisoners. Seventeen persons who had bor'n ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in the rebel army were executed at Kennington-Common
in the neighbourhood of London, and suffered with great
constancy under the dreadful tortures which their sen∣tence
prescribed: nine were put to death, in the same
manner, at Carlisle; six at Brumpton, seven at Penrit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and eleven at York: of these a considerable number we<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
gentlemen, and had acted as officers: about fifty had been
executed as deserters in different parts of Scotland: eigh∣ty-one
suffered the pains of the law as traitors. A se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
obtained pardons, aad a considerable number were trans∣ported
to the plantations. Bills of indictment for high<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
treason were found by the county of Surry against the
Earls of Kilmarnock and Cromartie, and Lord Balm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rino.
These noblemen were tried by their peers in Wes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>minster
hall, the Lord Chancellor presiding as Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
High-Steward for the occasion. The two Earls confesse<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
their crimes and in pathetick speeches recommend<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
themselves to his Majesty's mercy. Lord Balmeri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
pleaded not guilty: he denied his having been at Caro∣lisle
at the time specified in the indictment, but this e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ception
was over-ruled: then he moved a point of law <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
arrest of judgment, and was allowed to be heard by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="175" REF="181"/>
counsel. They might have expatiated on the hardship
of being tried by an <HI>ex post facto</HI> law, and claimed the
privilege of trial in the county where the act of treason
was said to have been committed. The same hardship
was imposed upon all the imprisoned rebels: they were
dragged in captivity to a strange country, far from their
friends and connexions, destitute of means to produce
evidence in their favour, even if they had been innocent
of the charge. Balmerino waved this plea, and submitted
to the court, which pronounced sentence of death upon
him and his two associates. Cromartie's life was spared,
but the other two were beheaded, in the month of Au∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ust,
on Tower-hill. Kilmarnock was a nobleman of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne personal accomplishments: he had been educated in
Revolution principles, and engaged in the rebellion, partly
from the desperate situation of his fortune, and partly from
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esentment to the government, on his being deprived of a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ension which he had for some time enjoyed. He was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onvinced of his having acted criminally, and died with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>arks of penitence and contrition. Balmerino had been
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red to arms, and acted upon principle: he was gallant,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rave, rough, and resolute: he eyed the implement of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eath with the most careless familiarity, and seemed to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riumph in his sufferings. In November, Mr. Ratcliff,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he titular Earl of Derwentwater, who had been taken
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a ship bound to Scotland, was arraigned on a former
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entence, passed against him in the year one thousand
even hundred and sixteen: he refused to acknowledge the
authority of the court, and pleaded that he was a subject of
France, honoured with a commission in the service of his
Most Christian Majesty. The identity of his person be∣ing
proved, a rule was made for his execution; and on
the eighth day of December he suffered decapitation, with
the most perfect composure and serenity. Lord Lovat,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow turned of fourscore, was impeached by the Com∣mons,
and tried in Westminster-hall before the Lord
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igh-Steward. John Murray, secretary to the Prince-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>retender,
and some of his own domesticks appearing
<PB N="176" REF="182"/>
against him, he was convicted of high-treason, and con∣demned.
Notwithstanding his age, infirmities, and the
recollection of his conscience, which was supposed to be
not altogether void of offence, he died like an old Roman,
exclaiming, “<HI>dulce et decorum pro patria mori.</HI>” He
surveyed the crowd with attention, examined the ax,
jested with the executioner, and laid his head upon the
block with the utmost indifference. From this last scene
of his life one would have concluded, that he had approved
himself a patriot from his youth, and never deviated from
the paths of virtue.</P>
<P>§ VII. The flame of war on the continent did not
expire at the election of an emperor, and the re-esta∣blishment
of peace among the princes of the empire.
On the contrary, it raged with double violence in conse∣quence
of these events; for the force that was before di∣vided
being now united in one body, exerted itself with
greater vigour and rapidity. The States-General were
overwhelmed with consternation. Notwithstanding the
pains they had taken to avoid a war, and the condescension
with which they had soothed and supplicated the French
Monarch in repeated embassies and memorials, they saw
themselves stripped of their barrier, and once more in dan∣ger
of being overwhelmed by that ambitious nation. The
city of Brussels had been reduced during the winter; so
that the enemy were in possession of all the Austrian Ne∣therlands,
except a few fortresses. Great part of the
forces belonging to the Republick were restricted from ac∣tion
by capitulations, to which they had subscribed. The
states were divided in their councils between the two fac∣tions
which had long subsisted. They trembled at the
prospect of seeing Zealand invaded in the spring. The
Orange party loudly called for an augmentation of their
forces by sea and land, that they might prosecute the war
with vigour. The common people, fond of novelty, daz∣zled
by the splendor of greatness, and fully persuaded that
nothing but a chief was wanting to their security, demand∣ed
the Prince of Orange as a Stadtholder; and even
<PB N="177" REF="183"/>
mingled menaces with their demands. The opposite fac∣tion
dreaded alike the power of a Stadtholder, the neigh∣bourhood
of a French army, and the seditious disposition of
the populace. An ambassador was sent to London with
representations of the imminent dangers which threatened
the republick; and he was ordered to sollicit in the most
pressing terms the assistance of his Britannic Majesty, that
the allies might have a superiority in the Netherlands by
the beginning of the campaign. The King was very well
disposed to comply with their request; but the rebellion in
his kingdom, and the dissentions in his cabinet, had retard∣ed
the supplies, and embarrassed him so much, that he
found it impossible to make those early preparations that
were necessary to check the career of the enemy.</P>
<P>§ VIII. The King of France, with his general, the
Count de Saxe, took the field in the latter end of April, at
the head of one hundred and twenty thousand men, and
advanced towards the allies, who, to the number of four-and-forty
thousand, were entrenched behind the Demer,
under the conduct of the Austrian general Bathiani, who
retired before them, and took post in the neighbourhood of
Breda, the capital of Dutch Brabant. Mareschal Saxe im∣mediately
invested Antwerp, which in a few days was sur∣rendered.
Then he appeared before the strong town of
Mons in Hainault, with an irresistible train of artillery, an
immense quantity of bombs and warlike implements. He
carried on his approaches with such unabating impetuousity,
that, notwithstanding a very vigorous defence, the garrison
was obliged to capitulate on the twenty-seventh day of
June, in about eight-and-twenty days after the place had
been invested. Sieges were not now carried on by the te∣dious
method of sapping. The French King found it
much more expeditious and effectual to bring into the field
a prodigious train of battering cannon, and enormous mor∣tars,
that kept up such a fire as no garrison could sustain,
and discharge such an incessant hail of bombs and bullets,
as in a very little time reduced to ruins the place, with all
its fortifications. St. Guislain and Charleroy met with
<PB N="178" REF="184"/>
the fate of Mons and Antwerp; so that by the middle of
July the French King was absolute master of Flanders,
Brabant, and Hainault.</P>
<P>§ IX. Prince Charles of Lorraine had by this time as∣sumed
the command of the confederate army at Terheyde,
which being re-enforced by the Hessian troops from Scot∣land,
and a fresh body of the Austrians under Count Pal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i,
amounted to eighty-seven thousand men, including the
Dutch forces commanded by the Prince of Waldeck. The
generals, supposing the next storm would fall upon Na∣mur,
marched towards that place, and took post in an ad∣vantageous
situation on the eighteenth day of July, in sight
of the French army, which was encamped at Gemblours.
Here they remained till the eighth day of August, when a
detachment of the enemy, commanded by Count Lowen∣dahl,
took possession of Huy, where he found a large maga∣zine
belonging to the confederates; and their communica∣tion
with Maestricht was cut off. Mareschal Saxe, on the
other side, took his measures so well, that they were utterly
deprived of all subsistence. Then Prince Charles, retiring
across the Maese, abandoned Namur to the efforts of the
enemy, by whom it was immediately invested. The
trenches were opened on the second day of September; and
the garrison, consisting of seven thousand Austrians, de∣fended
themselves with equal skill and resolution: but the
cannonading and bombardment were so terrible, that in
a few days the place was converted into a heap of rubbish;
and on the twenty-third day of the month the French mo∣narch
took possession of this strong fortress, which had for∣merly
sustained such dreadful attacks. Mean while the al∣lied
army encamped at Maestricht were joined by Sir John
Ligonier, with some British and Bavarian battalions; and
Prince Charles resolved to give the enemy battle. With
this view he passed the Maese on the thirteenth day of Sep∣tember,
and advanced towards Mareschal Saxe, whom he
found so advantageously posted at Tongres, that he thought
proper to march back to Maestricht. On the twenty-sixth
day of September he crossed the Jaar in his retreat;
<PB N="179" REF="185"/>
and his rear was attacked by the enemy, who were re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lsed.
But Count Saxe being re-enforced by a body of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oops, under the Count de Clermont, determined to bring
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> confederates to an engagement. On the thirteenth
day of the month he passed the Jaar, while they took pos∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ession
of the villages of Liers, Warem, and Roucoux,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rew up their forces in order of battle, and made prepara∣tions
for giving him a warm reception. On the first day of
October the enemy advanced in three columns; and a ter∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ble
cannonading began about noon. At two o'clock Prince
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aldeck on the left was charged with great fury; and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ter an obstinate defence overpowered by numbers.
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he villages were attacked in columns, and as one bri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade
was repulsed another succeeded; so that the allies
were obliged to abandon these posts, and retreat towards
Maestricht, with the loss of five thousand men, and thirty
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ieces of artillery. The victory, however, cost the French
general a much greater number of lives; and was attended
with no solid advantage. Sir John Ligonier, the Earls of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rawford<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This nobleman, so remarkable for his courage and thirst of glory, ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ited a very extraordinary instance of presence of mind on the morning it preceded this battle. He and some volunteers, accompanied by his ai∣du-camp, and attended by two orderly dragoons, had rode out before <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to reconnoitre the situation of the enemy; and fell in upon one of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> advanced guards. The serjeant who commanded it immediately turn∣out his men, and their pieces were presented when the earl first per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved them. Without betraying the least mark of disorder, he rode up to serjeant, and assuming the character of a French general, told him in it language, that there was no occasion for such ceremony. Then he ask-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>if they had perceived any of the enemy's parties? and being answered the negative, “Very well (said he) be upon your guard; and if you <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould be attacked, I will take care that you shall be sustained.” So say-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he and his company retired before the serjeant could recollect himself in the surprize occasioned by this unexpected address. In all probability was soon sensible of his mistake; for the incident was that very day <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>blickly mentioned in the French army. The Prince of Tingray, an offi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> in the Austrian service, having been taken prisoner in the battle that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ued, dined with Mareschal Count Saxe, who dismissed him on his pa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e. and desired he would charge himself with a facetious compliment to old friend, the Earl of Crawford. He wished his lordship joy of being French general, and said he could not help being displeased with the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>jeant, as he had not procured him the honour of his lordship's company dinner.</NOTE> and Rothes, Brigadier Douglas, and other of∣ficers
<PB N="180" REF="186"/>
of the British troops, distinguished themselves by
their gallantry and conduct on this occasion. This action
terminated the campaign. The allies passing the Maese,
took up their winter quarters in the duchies of Limburgh
and Luxembourgh; while the French cantoned their
troops in the places which they had newly conquered.</P>
<P>§ X. The campaign in Italy was altogether unfavour∣able
to the French and Spaniards. The house of Austria<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
being no longer pressed on the side of Germany, was ena∣bled
to make the stronger efforts in this country; and the
British subsidy encouraged the King of Sardinia to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
with redoubled vivacity. Mareschal Maillebois occupie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the greater part of Piedomont with about thirty thousand
men. Don Philip and the Count de Gages were at the
head of a greater number in the neighbourhood of Milan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
and the Duke of Modena, with eight thousand, secure<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his own dominions. The King of Sardinia augmented his
forces to six-and-thirty thousand; and the Austrian army
under the Prince of Lichtenstein, amounted to a much
greater number; so that the enemy were reduced to the
necessity of acting on the defensive, and retired towards the
Mantuan. In February Baron Leutrum, the Piedmo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
tese general, invested and took the strong fortress of Ass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.
He afterwards relieved the citadel of Alexandria, which
the Spaniards had blocked up in the winter, reduced Casa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
recovered Valencia, and obliged Maillebois to retire <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
neighbourhood of Genoa. On the other side, Don Phil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
and Count Gages abandoned Milan, Pavia, and Parm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
retreating before the Austrians with the utmost precipita∣tion
to Placentia, where they were joined on the third
June by the French forces under Maillebois.</P>
<P>§ XI. Before this junction was effected, the Spanish gene∣ral,
Pignatelli, had passed the river Po in the night with
strong detachment, and beaten up the quarters of seve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
thousand Austrians posted at Codogno. Don Philip, find∣ing
himself at the head of two-and-fifty thousand men
his junction with the French general, resolved to attack<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Austrians in their camp at San Lazaro, before they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="181" REF="187"/>
re-enforced by his Sardinian Majesty. Accordingly, on
the fourth day of June in the evening, he marched with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>qual silence and expedition, and entered the Austrian
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>renches about eleven, when a desperate battle ensued.
The Austrians were prepared for the attack, which they
sustained with great vigour till morning. Then they
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uitted their entrenchments, and charged the enemy in
their turn with such fury, that after an obstinate resistance
the combined army was broke, and retired with precipita∣tion
to Placentia, leaving on the field fifteen thousand men
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tilled, wounded, and taken, together with sixty colours,
and ten pieces of artillery. In a few weeks the Austrians
were joined by the Piedmontese: the King of Sardinia as∣sumed
the chief command; and Prince Lichtenstein being
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ndisposed, his place was supplied by the Marquis de Botta.
Don Philip retired to the other side of the Po, and extend∣ded
his conquests in the open country of the Milanese.
The King of Sardinia called a council of war, in which
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was determined that he should pass the river with a
strong body of troops, in order to straighten the enemy on
one side; while the Marquis de Botta should march up
the Tydone, to cut off their communication with Placen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia.
They forthwith quitted all the posts they had occu∣pied
between the Lambro and Adda, resolving to repass the
Po, and retreat to Tortona. With this view they threw
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ridges of boats over that river, and began to pass on the
ninth day of August in the evening. They were attacked
at Rotto Freddo by a detachment of Austrians, under Ge∣neral
Serbelloni, who maintained the engagement till ten
in the morning, when Botta arrived: the battle was re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ewed
with redoubled rage, and lasted till four in the after∣noon,
when the enemy retired in great disorder to Tortona,
with the loss of eight thousand men, a good number of co∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ours
and standards, and eighteen pieces of cannon. This
victory cost the Austrians four thousand men killed upon
the spot, including the gallant General Bernclau. The
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ctors immediately summoned Placentia to surrender; and
the garrison, consisting of nine thousand men, were made
<PB N="182" REF="188"/>
prisoners of war: Don Philip continued his retreat, and
of all his forces brought six-and-twenty thousand only into
the territories of Genoa.</P>
<P>§ XII. The Piedmontese and Austrians rejoining in
the neighbourhood of Pavia, advanced to Tortona, of
which they took possession without resistance, while the
enemy sheltered themselves under the cannon of Genoa.
They did not long continue in this situation: for on the
twenty-second day of August they were again in motion,
and retired into Provence. The court of Madrid im∣puting
the bad success of this campaign to the miscon∣duct
of Count Gages, recalled that general, and sent the
Marquis de las Minas to resume the command of the forces.
In the mean time, the victorious confederates appeared be∣fore
Genoa on the fourth day of December: and the se∣nate
of that city thinking it incapable of defence, submit∣ted
to a very mortifying capitulation, by which the gates
were delivered up to the Austrians, together with all their
arms, artillery, and ammunition: and the city was sub∣jected
to the most cruel contributions. The Marquis
de Botta being left at Genoa with sixteen thou∣sand
men, the King of Sardinia resolved to pass the Va<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
and pursue the French and Spaniards into Provence: but,
that monarch being seised with the small-pox, the con∣duct
of this expedition was entrusted to Count Brown, an
Austrian general of Irish extract, who had given repeated
proofs of uncommon valour and capacity. He was on this
occasion assisted by Vice-Admiral Medley, who command∣ed
the British squadron in the Mediterranean. The French
forces had fortified the passes of the Var, under the con∣duct
of the Mareschal de Belleisle, who thought proper to
abandon his posts at the approach of Count Brown; and
this general, at the head of fifty thousand men, passed the
river without opposition, on the ninth day of November.
While he advanced as far as Draguignan, laying the open
country under contribution, Baron Roth, with four-and-twenty
battalions, invested Antibes, which was at the
same time bombarded on the side of the sea by the British
<PB N="183" REF="189"/>
squadron. The trenches were opened on the twentieth
day of September: but Belleisle having assembled a nume∣rous
army, superior to that of the confederates, and the Ge∣noese
having expelled their Austrian guests, Count Brown
abandoned the enterprise, and repassed the Var, not with∣out
some damage from the enemy.</P>
<P>§ XIII. The court of Vienna, which has always pa∣tronised
oppression, exacted such heavy contributions from
the Genoese, and its directions were so rigorously put in
execution, that the people were reduced to despair; and
resolved to make a last effort for the recovery of their li∣berty
and independence. Accordingly, they took arms in
secret, seised several important posts of the city; sur∣prised
some battalions of the Austrians; surrounded others,
and cut them in pieces; and, in a word, drove them out
with great slaughter. The Marquis de Botta acted with
caution and spirit: but being overpowered by numbers,
and apprehensive of the peasants in the country, who were
in arms, he retreated to the pass of the Bochetta on the side
of Lombardy, where he secured himself in an advantageous
situation, until he could receive re-enforcements. The loss
he had sustained at Genoa did not hinder him from re∣ducing
Savona, a sea port town belonging to that republick;
and he afterwards made himself master of Gavi. The
Genoese, on the contrary, exerted themselves with won∣derful
industry in fortifying their city, raising troops, and
in taking other measures for a vigorous defence, in case
they should again be insulted.</P>
<P>§ XIV. The naval transactions of this year reflected
very little honour on the British nation. Commodore
Peyton, who commanded six ships of war in the East-In∣dies,
shamefully declined a decisive engagement with a
French squadron of inferior force: and abandoned the im∣portant
settlement of Madras on the coast of Coromandel,
which was taken without opposition in the month of Sep∣tember
by the French commodore, De la Bourdonnais.
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort St. David, and the other British factories in India,
would probably have shared the same fate, had not the
<PB N="184" REF="190"/>
enemy's naval force in that country been shattered and
partly destroyed by a terrible tempest. No event of conse∣quence
happened in America, though it was a scene that
seemed to promise the greatest success to the arms of Eng∣land.
The reduction of Cape-Breton had encouraged the
ministry to project the conquest of Quebeck, the capital of
Canada, situated upon the river of St. Laurence. Com∣missions
were sent to the governors of the British colonies
in North-America, empowering them to raise companies
to join the armament from England; and eight thousand
troops were actually raised in consequence of these direc∣tions;
while a powerful squadron and transports, having
six regiments on board, were prepared at Portsmouth for
this expedition. But their departure was postponed by
unaccountable delays, until the season was judged too far
advanced to risque the great ships on the boisterous coast of
North-America. That the armament, however, might
not be wholly useless to the nation, it was employed in
making a descent upon the coast of Bretagne, on the sup∣position
that Port L'Orient, the repository of all the stores
and ships belonging to the French East-India company,
might be surprised; or, that this invasion would alarm
the enemy, and, by making a diversion, facilitate the
operations of the Austrian general in Provence.</P>
<P>§ XV. The naval force intended for this service con∣sisted
of sixteen great ships, and eight frigates, besides
bomb-ketches and store-ships, commanded by Richard
Lestock, appointed admiral of the blue division. Six bat∣talions
of land troops, with a detachment of matrosses and
bombardiers, were embarked in thirty transports, under the
conduct of Lieutenant General Sinclair; and the whole
fleet set sail from Plymouth on the fourteenth day of Sep∣tember.
On the twentieth the troops were landed in Quim∣perlay-bay,
at the distance of ten miles from Port
L'Orient. The militia, re-enforced by some detachments
from different regiments, were assembled to the number of
two thousand, and seemed resolved to oppose the disem∣barkation:
but, seeing the British troops determined to
<PB N="185" REF="191"/>
and at all events, they thought proper to retire. Next
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay General Sinclair advanced into the country, skirmish∣ing
with the enemy in his route; and arriving at the vil∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>age
of Plemure, within half a league from Port L'Orient,
summoned that place to surrender. He was visited by a
reputation from the town, which offered to admit the Bri∣tish
forces, on condition that they should be restrained
from pillaging the inhabitants, and touching the maga∣zines;
and that they should pay a just price for their pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sions.
These terms being rejected, the inhabitants pre∣pared
for a vigorous defence; and the English general re∣solved
to besiege the place in form, though he had neither
time, artillery, nor forces sufficient for such an enterprise.
This strange resolution was owing to the declaration of the
engineers, who promised to lay the place in ashes in the space
of four-and-twenty hours. All his cannon amounted to
no more than a few field-pieces; and he was obliged to
wait for two iron guns, which the sailors dragged up from
the shipping. Had he given the assault on the first night
after his arrival, when the town was filled with terror and
confusion, and destitute of regular troops, in all probability
it would have been easily taken by scalade: but the reduc∣tion
of it was rendered impracticable by his delay. The
ramparts were mounted with cannon from the ships in the
harbour: new works were raised with great industry: the
garrison was re-enforced by several bodies of regular troops:
and great numbers were assembling from all parts; so that
the British forces were in danger of being surrounded in
an enemy's country. Notwithstanding these discourage∣ments,
they opened a small battery against the town,
which was set on fire in several places by their bombs and
red-hot bullets: they likewise repulsed part of the garrison
which had made a sally to destroy their works: but their
cannon producing no effect upon the fortifications, the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re from the town daily increasing, the engineers owning
they could not perform their promise, and Admiral Lestock
declaring in repeated messages, that he could no longer ex∣pose
the ships on an open coast at such a season of the year,
<PB N="186" REF="192"/>
General Sinclair abandoned the siege. Having caused the
two iron pieces of cannon and the mortars to be spiked, he
retreated in good order to the sea-side, where his troops
were re-embarked, having sustained very inconsiderable
damage since their first landing. He expected re-enforce∣ments
from England, and was resolved to wait a little lon∣ger
for their arrival, in hopes of being able to annoy the
enemy more effectually. In the beginning of October the
fleet sailed to Quiberon-Bay, where they destroyed the Ar∣dent,
a French ship of war of sixty-four guns; and a de∣tachment
of the forces being landed, took possession of a
fort on the peninsula; while the little islands of Houat and
Heydic were reduced by the failors. In this situation the
admiral and general continued till the seventeenth day of
the month, when the forts being dismantled, and the troops
re-embarked, the fleet sailed from the French coast: the
admiral returned to England, and the transports with the
soldiers proceeded to Ireland, where they arrived in safety.</P>
<P>§ XVI. This expedition, weak and frivolous as it may
seem, was resented by the French nation as one of the
greatest insults they had ever sustained; and demonstrated
the possibility of hurting France in her tenderest parts, by
means of an armament of this nature, well-timed, and vi∣gorously
conducted. Indeed, nothing could be more ab∣surd
or precipitate than an attempt to distress the enemy
by landing a handful of troops, without draft-horses,
tents, or artillery, from a fleet of ships lying on an open
beach, exposed to the uncertainty of weather in the most
tempestuous season of the year, so as to render the retreat
and re-embarkation altogether precarious. The British
squadrons in the West-Indies performed no exploit of con∣sequence
in the course of this year. The commerce was
but indifferently protected. Commodore Lee, stationed off
Martinico, allowed a French fleet of merchant-ships, and
their convoy, to pass by his squadron unmolested; and
Commodore Mitchell behaved scandalously in a rencontre
with the French squadron, under the conduct of Monsieur
de Constans, who in his return to Europe took the Severn,
<PB N="187" REF="193"/>
an English ship of fifty guns. The cruisers on all sides,
English, French, and Spaniards, were extremely alert; and
though the English lost the greater number of ships, this
difference was more than overbalanced by the superior
value of the prizes taken from the enemy. In the course of
this year two-and-twenty Spanish privateers, and sixty-six
merchant vessels, including ten register ships, fell into the
hands of the British cruisers: from the French<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the month of July, Philip V. King of Spain dying, in the sixty-third year of his age, was succeeded by his eldest son Ferdinand, born o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ria Louisa Gabriela, sister to the present King of Sardinia.

seven ships of war, ninety privateers, and about three hun∣dred
ships of commerce. The new King of Spain being
supposed well affected to the British nation, an effort was
made to detach him from the interests of France, by means
of the Marquis de Tabernega, who had formerly been his
favourite, and resided many years as a refugee in England.
This nobleman proceeded to Lisbon, where a negociation
was set on foot with the court of Madrid. But his efforts
miscarried; and the influence of the queen mother conti∣nued
to predominate in the Spanish councils. The States-General
had for some years endeavoured to promote a paci∣fication
by remonstrances, and even entreaties, at the court
of Versailles: the French King at length discovered an in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ination
to peace, and in September a congress was
opened at Breda, the capital of Dutch Brabant, where the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enipotentiaries of the Emperor, Great-Britain, France,
and Holland were assembled: but the French were so
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>solent in their demands, that the conferences were soon
interrupted.</P>
<P>§ XVII. The parliament of Great-Britain meeting in
November, the King exhorted them to concert with all
possible expedition the proper measures for pursuing the war
with vigour, that the consederate army in the Netherlands
<PB N="188" REF="194"/>
might be seasonably augmented: he, likewise, gave them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
understand, that the funds appropriated for the support <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
his civil government had for some years past fallen short <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the revenue intended and granted by parliament; and said
he relied on their known affection to find out some method
to make good this deficiency. As all those who ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
conducted the opposition were now concerned in the
administration, little or no objection was made to any
demand or proposal of the government and its ministers.
The Commons having considered the estimates, voted forty
thousand seamen for the service of the ensuing year, and
about sixty thousand land-forces, including eleven thousand
five hundred marines. They granted four hundred and
thirty-three thousand pounds to the Empress Queen of Hun∣gary;
three hundred thousand pounds to the King of Sar∣dinia;
four hundred and ten thousand pounds for the main∣tenance
of eighteen thousand Hanoverian auxiliaries; one
hundred and sixty-one thousand six hundred and seven
pounds, for six thousand Hessians; subsidies to the Elector
of Cologn, Mentz, and Bavaria; and the sum of five hun∣dred
thousand pounds to enable his Majesty to prosecut
the war with advantage. In a word, the supplies amount∣ed
to nine millions four hundred twenty-five thousand
two hundred fifty-four pounds; a sum almost incredible
if we consider how the kingdom had been already drain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of its treasure. It was raised by the usual taxes, re-en∣forced
with new impositions on windows, carriages, and
spirituous liquors, a lottery, and a loan from the sinking
fund. The new taxes were mortgaged for four million
by transferable annuities, at an interest of four, and a pre∣mium
of ten per centum. By reflecting on these enor∣mous
grants, one would imagine the ministry had been
determined to impoverish the nation: but, from the eager∣ness
and expedition with which the people subscribed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the money, one would conclude that the riches of the
kingdom were inexhaustible. It may not be amiss to of
serve, that the supplies of this year exceeded, by two mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lions
and a half, the greatest annual sum that was raise
<PB N="189" REF="195"/>
during the reign of Queen Anne, though she maintained as
great a number of troops as was now in the pay of Great-Britain,
and her armies and fleets acquired every year fresh
harvests of glory and advantage: whereas this war had
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oved an almost uninterrupted series of events big with
disaster and dishonour. During the last two years, the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aval expense of England had exceeded that of France
above five millions sterling; though her fleets had not
obtained one signal advantage over the enemy at sea, nor
been able to protect her commerce from their depredations.
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he was at once a prey to her declared adversaries and pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essed
friends. Before the end of summer, she numbered
among her mercenaries two empresses, five German
Princes, and a powerful monarch, whom she hired to assist
her in trimming the balance of Europe, in which they
themselves were immediately interested, and she had no
more than a secondary concern. Had these fruitless sub∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dies
been saved: had the national revenue been applied
with oeconomy to national purposes: had it been em∣ployed
in liquidating gradually the publick incumbrances;
in augmenting the navy, improving manufactures, encou∣raging
and securing the colonies, and extending trade and
navigation, corruption would have become altogether un∣necessary,
and disaffection would have vanished: the
people would have been eased of their burthens, and ceased
to complain: commerce would have flourished, and pro∣duced
such affluence as must have raised Great-Britain to
the highest pinnacle of maritime power, above all rivalship
or competition. She would have been dreaded by her ene∣mies;
revered by her neighbours: oppressed nations
would have crept under her wings for protection; con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ending
potentates would have appealed to her decision;
and she would have shone the universal arbitress of Europe.
How different is her present situation! her debts are enor∣mous,
her taxes intolerable, her people discontented, and
the sinews of her government relaxed. Without con∣duct,
confidence, or concert, she engages in blundering
negociations: she involves herself rashly in foreign
<PB N="190" REF="196"/>
quarrels, and lavishes her substance with the most dan∣gerous
precipitation: she is even deserted by her wonted
vigour, steadiness and intrepidity: she grows vain, fan∣tastical,
and pusillanimous: her arms are despised by
her enemies: and her councils ridiculed through all
Christendom.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. The King, in order to exhibit a specimen
of his desire to diminish the publick expense, ordered the
third and fourth troops of his life-guards to be disbanded,
and reduced three regiments of horse to the quality of
dragoons. The House of Commons presented an address
of thanks for this instance of oeconomy, by which the
annual sum of seventy thousand pounds was saved to the
nation. Notwithstanding this seeming harmony between
the King and the great council of the nation, his Ma∣jesty
resolved, with the advice of his council, to dissolve
the present parliament, though the term of seven years
was not yet expired since its first meeting. The ministry
affected to insinuate, that the States-General were un∣willing
to concur with his Majesty in vigorous measures
against France, during the existence of a parliament which
had undergone such a vicissitude of complexion. The
allies of Great-Britain, far from being suspicious of this
assembly, which had supplied them so liberally, saw with
concern, that, according to law, it would soon be dis∣missed;
and they doubted whether another could be pro∣cured
equally agreeable to their purposes. In order to re∣move
this doubt, the ministry resolved to surprise the
kingdom with a new election, before the malcontents
should be prepared to oppose the friends of the government
Accordingly, when the business of the session was di∣spatched,
the King having given the royal assent to the
several acts they had prepared, dismissed them in the
month of June,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. 1747.</NOTE> with an affectionate speech, that breathed
nothing but tenderness and gratitude. The parliament
was immediately dissolved by proclamation, and new writ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
were issued for convoking another. Among the laws
passed in this session, was an act abolishing the heritable
<PB N="191" REF="197"/>
jurisdictions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IX. 1747.</NOTE> and taking away the tenour of wardhold∣ings
in Scotland, which were reckoned among the prin∣cipal
sources of those rebellions that had been excited
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Revolution. In the Highlands they certainly
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the common people in subjection to their chiefs,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hom they implicitly followed and obeyed in all their
undertakings. By this act these mountaineers were le∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lly
emancipated from slavery: but as the tenants enjoyed
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> leases, and were at all times liable to be ejected from
their farms, they still depended on the pleasure of their
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ds, notwithstanding this interposition of the legislature,
which granted a valuable consideration in money to every
nobleman and petty baron, who was thus deprived of one
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rt of his inheritance. The forfeited estates, indeed,
were divided into small farms, and let by the government
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> leases at an under value; so that those who had the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>od fortune to obtain such leases tasted the sweets of in∣dependence:
but the Highlanders in general were left in
their original indigence and incapacity, at the mercy of
their superiors. Had manufactures and fisheries been esta∣blished
in different parts of their country, they would
have seen and felt the happy consequences of industry,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in a little time been effectually detached from all their
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vish connexions.</P>
<P>§ XIX. The operations of the campaign had been con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rted
in the winter at the Hague, between the Duke of
Cumberland and the States-General of the United-Pro∣vinces,
who were by this time generally convinced of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ance's design to encroach upon their territories. They,
therefore, determined to take effectual measures against
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at restless and ambitious neighbour. The allied powers
agreed to assemble a vast army in the Netherlands; and it
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> resolved that the Austrians and Piedmontese should
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more penetrate into Provence. The Dutch patriots,
however, were not roused into this exertion, until all
their remonstrances had sailed at the court of Versailles;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>til they had been urged by repeated memorials of the
English ambassador, and stimulated by the immediate
<PB N="192" REF="198"/>
danger to which their country was exposed:<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1747.</NOTE> for France
was by this time possessed of all the Austrian Netherlands,
and seemed bent upon penetrating into the territories of the
United Provinces. In February, the Duke of Cumber∣land
began to assemble the allied forces; and in the latter
end of March they took the field in three separate bo∣dies.
His royal highness, with the English, Hanoveriam,
and Hessians, fixed his head-quarters at the village of Til∣berg:
the Prince of Waldeck was posted with the Dutch
troops at Breda; and Mareschal Bathiani collected the
Austrians and Bavarians in the neighbourhood of Venlo.
The whole army amounted to one hundred and twenty
thousand men, who lay inactive six weeks, exposed to the
inclemency of the weather, and almost destitute of sorage
and provision. Count Saxe, by this time created mares∣chal-general
of France, continued his troops within their
cantonments at Bruges, Antwerp, and Brussels, de∣claring,
that when the allied army should be weakened
by sickness and mortality, he would convince the Duke of
Cumberland, that the first duty of a general is to pro∣vide
for the health and preservation of his troops. In
April this fortunate commander took the field, at the
head of one hundred and forty thousand men; and the
Count de Clermont commanded a separate body of nine∣teen
battalions and thirty squadrons. Count Lowendah<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was detached on the sixteenth day of the month, with
seven-and-twenty thousand men, to invade Dutch Flan∣ders:
at the same time, the French minister at the Hagu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
presented a memorial to the States, intimating, that his
master was obliged to take this step by the necessity of
war: but that his troops should observe the stictest disci∣pline,
without interfering with the religion, government
or commerce of the republick: he likewise declared, that
the countries and places of which he might be obliged
to take possession should be detained no otherwise than a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
a pledge, to be restored as soon as the United Province
should give convincing proofs that they would no longe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
furnish the enemies of France with succours.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="199"/>
§ XX. While the States deliberated upon this decla∣ration,
Count Lowendahl entered Dutch Brabant, and
invested the town and fortress of Sluys, the garrison of
which surrendered themselves prisoners of war on the
nineteenth day of April. This was likewise the fate of
Sas-van-Ghent; while the Marquis de Contades, with
another detachment, reduced the forts Perle and Leifken∣shoek,
with the town of Philippine, even within hearing
of the confederate army. The fort of Sanberg was vigo∣rously
defended by two English battalions: but they were
overpowered, and obliged to retire to Welsthoorden; and
Count Lowendahl undertook the siege of Hulst, which
was shamefully surrendered by La Roque, the Dutch go∣vernour,
though he knew that a re-enforcement of nine
battalions was on the march to his relief. Then the French
general took possession of Axel and Terneuse, and began
to prepare flat-bottomed boats for a descent on the island of
Zealand. The Dutch people were now struck with con∣sternation.
They saw the enemy at their doors, and owed
their immediate preservation to the British squadron sta∣tioned
at the Swin, under the command of Commodore
Mitchel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Not the person who commanded in the West-Indies.</NOTE>, who, by means of his sloops, tenders, and
small craft, took such measures as defeated the intention
of Lowendahl. The common people in Zealand being
reduced to despair, began to clamour loudly against their
governours, as if they had not taken the proper mea∣sures
for their security. The friends of the Prince of
Orange did not neglect this opportunity of promoting his
interest. They encouraged their discontent; and exag∣gerated
the danger: they reminded them of the year one
thousand six hundred and seventy-two, when the French
King was at the gates of Amsterdam, and the republick
was saved by the choice of a stadtholder: they exhorted
them to turn their eyes on the descendant of those heroes
who had established the liberty and independence of the
United-Provinces: they extolled his virtue and ability;
his generosity, his justice, his unshaken love to his coun∣try.
The people in several towns, inflamed by such re∣presentations
to tumult and sedition, compelled their
<PB N="194" REF="200"/>
magistrates to declare the Prince of Orange stadtholder.
He himself, in a letter to the states of Zealand, offered
his services for the defence of the province. On the
twenty-eighth day of April, he was nominated captain-ge∣neral
and admiral of Zealand. Their example was
followed by Rotterdam and the whole province of
Holland; and on the second day of May, the Prince
of Orange was, in the assembly of the States-General, in∣vested
with the power and dignity of stadtholder, captain
general, and admiral of the United-Provinces. The vigo∣rous
consequences of this resolution immediately appeared.
All commerce and contracts with the French were prohi∣bited:
the peasants were armed and exercised: a resolu∣tion
passed for making a considerable augmentation of the
army: a council of war was established for enquiring
into the conduct of the governors who had given up
the frontier places; and orders were issued to commence
hostilities against the French, both by sea and land.</P>
<P>§ XXI. Mean while, the Duke of Cumberland took
post with his whole army between the two Nethes, to co∣ver
Bergen-op Zoom and Maestricht; and Mareschal
Saxe called in his detachments, with a view to hazard
a general engagement. In the latter end of May, the
French King arrived at Brussels; and his general resolved
to undertake the siege of Maestricht. For this purpose
he advanced towards Louvain; and the confederates per∣ceiving
his drift, began their march to make post between
the town and the enemy. On the twentieth day of June,
they took possession of their ground, and were drawn up
in order of battle, with their right at Bilsen, and their
left extending to Wirle, within a mile of Maestricht,
having in the front of their left wing the village of Laf∣feldt,
in which they posted several battalions of British
infantry. The French had taken possession of the heights
of Herdeeren, immediately above the allies; and both
armies cannonaded each other till the evening. In the
morning, the enemy's infantry marched down the hill,
in a prodigious column, and attacked the village of Laf∣feldt,
which was well fortified, and defended with amazing
<PB N="195" REF="201"/>
obstinacy. The assailants suffered terribly in their ap∣proach,
from the cannon of the confederates, which was
served with surprising dexterity and success; and they met
with such a warm reception from the British-musquetry
as they could not withstand: but, when they were bro∣ken
and dispersed, fresh brigades succeeded with astonish∣ing
perseverance. The confederates were driven out of
the village: yet being sustained by three regiments, they
measured back their ground, and repulsed the enemy with
great slaughter. Nevertheless, Count Saxe continued
pouring in other battalions; and the French regained
and maintained their footing in the village, after it had
been three times lost and carried. The action was chiefly
confined to this post, where the field exhibited a horrible
scene of carnage. At noon the Duke of Cumberland
ordered the whole left wing to advance against the enemy,
whose infantry gave way: Prince Waldeck led up the
centre: Mareschal Bathiani made a motion with the right
wing towards Herdeeren, and victory seemed ready to
declare for the confederates, when the fortune of the day
took a sudden turn to their prejudice. Several squadrons
of Dutch horse, posted in the centre, gave way, and
flying at full gallop, overthrew five battalions of infantry
that were advancing from the body of reserve. The French
cavalry charged them with great impetuosity, increasing
the confusion that was already produced, and penetrating
through the lines of the allied army, which was thus di∣vided
about the centre. The Duke of Cumberland, who
exerted himself with equal courage and activity in at∣tempting
to remedy this disorder, was in danger of being
taken; and the defeat would in all probability have been
total, had not Sir John Ligonier taken the resolution of
sacrificing himself and a part of the troops to the safety
of the army. At the head of three British regiments of
dragoons, and some squadrons of Imperial horse, he
charged the whole line of the French cavalry, with such
intrepidity and success, that he overthrew all that opposed
him, and made such a diversion as enabled the Duke of
Cumberland to effect an orderly retreat to Maestricht.
<PB N="196" REF="202"/>
He himself was taken by a French carabineer, after his
horse had been killed: but the regiments he commanded
retired with deliberation. The confederates retreated to
Maestricht, without having sustained much damage from
the pursuit, and even brought off all their artillery, except
sixteen pieces of cannon. Their loss did not exceed six
thousand men killed and taken; whereas the French gene∣ral
purchased the victory at a much greater expense. The
common cause of the confederate powers is said to have
suffered from the pride and ignorance of their generals.
On the eve of the battle, when the detachment of the
Count de Clermont appeared on the hill of Herdeeren,
Mareschal Bathiani asked permission of the commander in
chief to attack them before they should be re-enforced,
declaring he would answer for the success of the enterprise.
No regard was paid to this proposal: but the superior
asked in his turn where the Mareschal would be in case
he should be wanted? He replied, “I shall always be
found at the head of my troops,” and retired in disgust.
The subsequent disposition has likewise been blamed, in∣asmuch
as not above one half of the army could act,
while the enemy exerted their whole force.</P>
<P>§ XXII. The confederates passed the Maese, and en∣camped
in the duchy of Limburg, so as to cover
Maestricht: while the French King remained with his
army in the neighbourhood of Tongres. Mareschal
Saxe, having amused the allies with marches and counter∣marches,
at length detached Count Lowendahl with six-and-thirty
thousand men to besiege. Bergen-op-zoom, the
strongest fortification of Dutch Brabant, the favourite
work of the famous engineer Coehorn, never conquered,
and generally esteemed invincible. It was secured with
a garrison of three thousand men, and well provided with
artillery, ammunition, and magazines. The enemy ap∣peared
before it on the twelfth day of July, and summoned
the governor to surrender. The Prince of Saxe Hild∣burghausen
was sent to its relief, with twenty battalions
and fourteen squadrons of the troops, that could be most
conveniently assembled: he entered the lines of Bergen-op-zoom,
<PB N="197" REF="203"/>
where he remained in expectation of a strong
re-enforcement from the confederate army: and the old
Baron Cronstrom, whom the Stadtholder had appointed
governor of Brabant, assumed the command of the gar∣rison.
The besiegers carried on their operations with
great vivacity; and the troops in the town defended it
with equal vigour. The eyes of all Europe were turned
upon this important siege: Count Lowendahl received
divers re-enforcements; and a considerable body of troops
was detached from the allied army, under the command of
Baron Schwartzemberg, to co-operate with the Prince
of Saxe-Hildburghausen. The French general lost a
great number of men by the close and continual fire of
the besieged; while he, in his turn, opened such a num∣ber
of batteries, and plied them so warmly, that the de∣fences
began to give way. From the sixteenth day of
July to the fifteenth of September, the siege produced an
unintermitting scene of horror and destruction: despe∣rate
sallies were made, and mines sprung with the most
dreadful effects: the works began to be shattered: the
town was laid in ashes: the trenches were filled with
carnage: nothing was seen but fire and smoke; nothing
heard but one continued roar of bombs and cannon. But,
still the damage fell chiefly on the besiegers, who were
stain in heaps; while the garrison suffered very little, and
could be occasionally relieved or re-enforced from the
lines. In a word, it was generally believed that Count
Lowendahl would be baffled in his endeavours; and by
this belief the governor of Bergen-op-zoom seems to
have been lulled into a blind security. At length, some
inconsiderable breaches were made in one ravelin and two
bastions, and these the French general resolved to storm,
though Cronstrom believed they were impracticable; and
on that supposition presumed that the enemy would not
attempt an assault. For this very reason Count Lowen∣dahl
resolved to hazard the attack, before the preparations
should be made for his reception. He accordingly regu∣lated
his dispositions, and at four o'clock in the morning,
<PB N="198" REF="204"/>
on the sixteenth day of September, the signal was made
for the assault. A prodigious quantity of bombs being
thrown into the ravelin, his troops threw themselves into
the fossé, mounted the breaches, forced open a sally-port,
and entered the place, almost without resistance. In a
word, they had time to extend themselves along the cur∣tains,
and form in order of battle, before the garrison
could be assembled. Cronstrom was asleep, and the sol∣diers
upon duty had been surprised by the suddenness and
impetuosity of the attack. Though the French had taken
possession of the ramparts, they did not gain the town
without opposition. Two battalions of the Scottish
troops, in the pay of the States-General, were assembled
in the market-place, and attacked them with such fury,
that they were driven from street to street, until fresh re∣enforcements
arriving, compelled the Scots to retreat in
their turn: yet, they disputed every inch of ground, and
fought until two thirds of them were killed upon the spot.
Then they brought off the old governour, abandoning
the town to the enemy: the troops that were encamped
in the lines retreating with great precipitation, all the
forts in the neighbourhood immediately surrendered to the
victors, who now became masters of the whole naviga∣tion
of the Schelde. The French King was no sooner
informed of Lowendahl's success, than he promoted him
to the rank of Mareschal of France; appointed Count
Saxe governour of the conquered Netherlands; and re∣turned
in triumph to Versailles. In a little time after this
transaction, both armies were distributed into winter∣quarters,
and the Duke of Cumberland embarked for
England.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. In Italy the French arms did not triumph
with equal success, though the Mareschal de Belleisle saw
himself at the head of a powerful army in Provence. In
April he passed the Var without opposition, and took pos∣session
of Nice. He met with little or no resistance in
reducing Montalban, Villafranca, and Ventimiglia;
while General Brown, with eight-and-twenty thousand
<PB N="199" REF="205"/>
Austrians, retired towards Final and Savona. In the
mean time, another large body, under Count Schuylem∣berg,
who had succeeded the Marquis de Botta, co-ope∣rated
with fifteen thousand Piedmontese in an attempt to
recover the city of Genoa. The French King had sent
thither supplies, succours, and engineers, with the Duke
de Boufflers, as ambassador to the republick, who likewise
acted as commander in chief of the forces employed for its
defence. The Austrian general assembled his troops in the
Milanese: having forced the passage of the Bochetta on
the thirteenth of January, he advanced into the territories
of Genoa, and the Riviera was ravaged without mercy.
On the last day of March he appeared before the city, at
the head of forty thousand men, and summoned the re∣volters
to lay down their arms. The answer he received
was, that the republick had fifty-four thousand men in
arms, two hundred and sixty cannon, thirty-four mor∣tars,
with abundance of ammunition and provision: that
they would defend their liberty with their last blood, and
be buried in the ruins of their capital, rather than sub∣mit
to the clemency of the court of Vienna, except by an
honourable capitulation, guaranteed by the Kings of
Great-Britain and Sardinia, the republick of Venice, and
the United Provinces. In the beginning of May, Genoa
was invested on all sides: a furious sally was made by the
Duke de Boufflers, who drove the besiegers from their
posts; but the Austrians rallying, he was repulsed in his
turn, with the loss of seven hundred men. General Schuy∣lemberg
carried on his operations with such skill, vigour,
and intrepidity, that he made himself master of the sub∣urbs
of Bisagno; and in all probability would have re∣duced
the city, had not be been obliged to desist, in con∣sequence
of the repeated remonstrances made by the King
of Sardinia and Count Brown, who represented the neces∣sity
of his abandoning his enterprise, and drawing off
his army, to cover Piedmont and Lombardy from the
efforts of Mareschal de Belleisle. Accordingly, he raised
the siege on the tenth day of June, and returned into the
<PB N="200" REF="206"/>
Milanese, in order to join his Sardinian Majesty; while
the Genoese made an irruption into the Parmesan and
Placentin, where they committed terrible outrages, in
revenge for the mischiefs they had undergone.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. While the Mareschal de Belleisle remained at
Ventimiglia, his brother, at the head of four-and-thirty
thousand French and Spaniards, attempted to penetrate
into Piedmont: on the sixth day of July he arrived at
the pass of Exilles, a strong fortress on the frontiers of
Dauphiné, situated on the north side of the river Doria.
The defence of this important post the King of Sardinia
had committed to the care of the Count de Brigueras,
who formed an encampment behind the lines, with fourteen
battalions of Piedmontese and Austrians, while divers
detachments were posted along all the passes of the Alps.
On the eighth day of the month the Piedmontese en∣trenchments
were attacked by the Chevalier de Belleisle,
with incredible intrepidity: but the columns were re∣pulsed
with great loss in three successive attacks. Impa∣tient
of this obstinate opposition, and determined not to
survive a miscarriage, this impetuous general seised a pair
of colours, and advancing at the head of his troops,
through a prodigious fire, pitched them with his own hand
on the enemy's entrenchments. At that instant he fell
dead, having received two musquet balls and the thrust of
a bayonet in his body. The assailants were so much dis∣pirited
by the death of their commander, that they forth∣with
gave way, and retreated with precipitation towards
Sestrieres, having lost near five thousand men in the at∣tack.
The Mareschal was no sooner informed of his bro∣ther's
misfortune than he retreated towards the Var, to join
the troops from Exilles: while the King of Sardinia, hav∣ing
assembled an army of seventy thousand men, threatened
Dauphiné with an invasion: but the excessive rains pre∣vented
the execution of his design. General Leutrum was
detached with twenty battalions to drive the French from
Ventimiglia; but, Belleisle marching back, that scheme
was likewise frustrated: and thus ended the campaign.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="207"/>
§ XXV. In this manner was the French King baf∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed
in his projects upon Italy: nor was he more for∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unate
in his naval operations. He had, in the preceding
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear, equipped an expensive armament, under the command
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the Duke d'Anville, for the recovery of Cape-Breton:
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut it was rendered ineffectual by storms, distempers, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he death of the commander. Not yet discouraged by
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hese disasters, he resolved to renew his efforts against the
British colonies in North-America, and their settlements
in the East-Indies. For these purposes two squadrons
were prepared at Brest, one to be commanded by the Com∣modore
De la Jonquiere; and the other, destined for In∣dia,
by Monsieur de St. George. The ministry of Great-Britain,
being apprised of these measures, resolved to in∣tercept
both squadrons, which were to set sail together.
For this purpose Vice-Admiral Anson and Rear-Admiral
Warren took their departure from Plymouth with a for∣midable
fleet, and steered their course to Cape Finisterre
on the coast of Gallicia. On the third day of May they
fell in with the French squadrons commanded by La Jon∣quiere
and St. George, consisting of six large ships of war,
as many frigates, and four armed vessels equipped by their
East India company, having under their convoy about
thirty ships laden with merchandise. Those prepared for
war immediately shortened sail, and formed a line of battle;
while the rest, under the protection of the six frigates,
proceeded on their voyage with all the sail they could
carry. The British squadron was likewise drawn up in
line of battle: but Mr. Warren perceiving that the
enemy began to sheer off, now their convoy was at a con∣siderable
distance, advised Admiral Anson to haul in the
signal for the line, and hoist another for giving chase and
engaging, otherwise the French would in all probability
escape by favour of the night. The proposal was em∣braced;
and in a little time the engagement began with
great fury, about four o'clock in the afternoon. The
enemy sustained the battle with equal conduct and valour,
until they were overpowered by numbers, and then they
<PB N="202" REF="208"/>
struck their colours. The Admiral detached three ships
in pursuit of the convoy, nine sail of which were taken;
but the rest were saved by the intervening darkness. About
seven hundred of the French were killed and wounded in
this action. The English lost about five hundred; and
among these, Captain Grenville, commander of the ship
Defiance. He was nephew to the Lord Viscount Cob∣ham,
a youth of the most amiable character and pro∣mising
genius, animated with the noblest sentiments o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
honour and patriotism. Eager in the pursuit of glory, he
rushed into the midst of the battle, where both his leg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
were cut off by a cannon ball. He submitted to his fate
with the most heroick resignation, and died universally la∣mented
and beloved. The success of the British army
in this engagement was chiefly owing to the conduct,
activity, and courage of the rear-admiral. A considera∣ble
quantity of bullion was found in the prizes, which
were brought to Spithead in triumph; and the treasure
being landed, was conveyed in twenty waggons to the
bank of London. Admiral Anson was ennobled, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Mr. Warren honoured with the order of the Bath.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. About the middle of June, Commodore Fox
with six ships of war, cruising in the latitude of Cape Or<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tegal
in Gallicia, took above forty French ships, richly
laden from St. Domingo, after they had been abandoned
by their convoy. But the French King sustained another
more important loss at sea, in the month of October
Rear-Admiral Hawke sailed from Plymouth in the be∣ginning
of August, with fourteen ships of the line, to
intercept a fleet of French merchant ships bound for the
West-Indies. He cruised for some time on the coast o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Bretagne; and at length the French fleet sailed from th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
isle of Aix, under convoy of nine ships of the line, beside
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rigates, commanded by Monsieur de Letendeur. On the
fourteenth day of October the two squadrons were i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
sight of each other, in the latitude of Belleisle. The
French commodore immediately ordered one of his great
ships and the frigates to proceed with the trading ships
<PB N="203" REF="209"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hile he formed the line of battle, and waited the attack.
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t eleven in the forenoon Admiral Hawke displayed the sig∣nal
to chase, and in half an hour both fleets were engaged.
The battle lasted till night, when all the French squadron,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cept the Intrepide and Tonant, had struck to the English
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ag. These two capital ships escaped in the dark, and re∣turned
to Brest in a shattered condition. The French cap∣tains
sustained the unequal fight with uncommon bravery
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d resolution, and did not yield until their ships were dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led.
Their loss in men amounted to eight hundred:
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e number of English killed in this engagement did not
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceed two hundred, including Captain Saumarez, a gal∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt
officer, who had served under Lord Anson in his expe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion
to the Pacifick Ocean. Indeed, it must be owned,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r the honour of that nobleman, that all the officers form∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
under his example, and raised by his influence, approv∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l
themselves in all respects worthy of the commands to
which they were preferred. Immediately after the action,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dmiral Hawke dispatched a sloop to Commodore Legge,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose squadron was stationed at the Leeward Islands,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith intelligence of the French fleet on merchant-ships,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tward bound, that he might take the proper measures
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r intercepting them in their passage to Martinique, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e other French islands. In consequence of this advice,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e redoubled his vigilance, and a good number of them
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll into his hands. Admiral Hawke conducted his prizes
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Spithead; and in his letter to the board of Admiralty
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>clared that all his captains behaved like men of honour
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring the engagement, except Mr. Fox, whose conduct
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> desired might be subjected to an enquiry. That gentle∣man
was accordingly tried by a court-martial, and sus∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended
from his command, for having followed the ad∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce
of his officers, contrary to his own better judgment:
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut he was soon restored, and afterwards promoted to the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nk of admiral; while Mr. Matthews, whose courage
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver incurred suspicion, still laboured under a suspen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on
for that which had been successfully practised in both
<PB N="204" REF="210"/>
these late actions, namely, engaging the enemy without
any regard to the line of battle.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. In the Mediterranean Vice-Admiral Medle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
blocked up the Spanish squadron in Carthagena; assisted
the Austrian general on the coast of Villafranca; and in∣tercepted
some of the succours sent from France to the
assistance of the Genoese. At his death, which happened
in the beginning of August, the command of that squa∣dron
devolved upon Rear-Admiral Byng, who proceeded
on the same plan of operation. In the summer, two Bri∣tish
ships of war, having under their convoy a fleet of
merchant ships bound to North-America, fell in with the
Glorioso, a Spanish ship of eighty guns, in the latitude
of the Western Isles. She had sailed from the Havannah,
with an immense treasure on board, and must have fallen
a prize to the English ships, had each captain done his
duty. Captain Erskine, in the Warwick, of sixty guns,
attacked her with great intrepidity, and fought until his
ship was entirely disabled: but being unsustained by his
con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort, he was obliged to haul off, and the Glorioso ar∣rived
in safety at Ferrol: there the silver was landed, and
she proceeded on her voyage to Cadiz, which, however,
she did not reach. She was encountered by the Dart∣mouth,
a British frigate of forty guns, commanded by
Captain Hamilton, a gallant youth, who, notwithstand∣ing
the inequality of force, engaged her without hesita∣tion:
but in the heat of the action, his ship being set on
fire by accident, was blown up, and he perished with all
his crew, except a midshipman and ten or eleven sailors,
who were taken up alive by a privateer that happened to
be in sight. Favourable as this accident may seem to the
Glorioso, she did not escape. An English ship of eighty
guns, under the command of Captain Buckle, came up,
and obliged the Spaniards to surrender, after a short but
vigorous engagement. Commodore Grissin had been sent,
with a re-enforcement of ships, to assume the command
of the squadron in the East-Indies; and although his ar∣rival
secured Fort St. David's, and the other British settle∣ments
<PB N="205" REF="211"/>
in that country, from the insults of Monsieur de
Bourdonnais, his strength was not sufficient to enable
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to undertake any enterprise of importance against the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>emy: the ministry of England, therefore, resolved to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uip a fresh armament, that when joined by the ships in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dia should be in a condition to besiege Pondicherry,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> principal settlement belonging to the French on the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast of Coromandel. For this service, a good number
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> independent companies was raised, and set sail in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quel, with a strong squadron under the conduct of Rear-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dmiral
Boscawen, an officer of unquestioned valour and
capacity. In the course of this year, the British cruisers
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere so alert and successful, that they took six hundred
and forty-four prizes from the French and Spaniards,
whereas the loss of Great-Britain, in the same time, did
not exceed five hundred and fifty.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. All the belligerent powers were by this
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me heartily tired of a war which had consumed an im∣mensity
of treasure, had been productive of so much
mischief, and in the events of which all, in their turns,
had found themselves disappointed. Immediately after
the battle of Laffeldt, the King of France had, in
a personal conversation with Sir John Ligonier, ex∣pressed
his desire of a pacification; and afterwards his mi∣nister
at the Hague presented a declaration on the same
subject to the deputies of the States-General. The sig∣nal
success of the British arms at sea confirmed him in
these sentiments, which were likewise re-enforced by a
variety of other considerations. His finances were almost
exhausted, and his supplies from the Spanish West-Indies
rendered so precarious by the vigilance of the British cruis∣ers,
that he could no longer depend upon their arrival.
The trading part of his subjects had sustained such losses,
that his kingdom was filled with bankruptcies; and the
best part of his navy now contributed to strengthen the
fleets of his enemies. The election of a stadtholder had
united the whole power of the States-General against him,
in taking the most resolute measures for their own safety <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="206" REF="212"/>
his views in Germany were entirely frustrated by the ele∣vation
of the Grand Duke to the Imperial throne, and
the re-establishment of peace between the houses of Austria
and Brandenburgh; the success of his arms in Italy
had not at all answered his expectation; and Genoa war
become an expensive ally. He had the mortification to
see the commerce of Britain flourish in the midst of war,
while his own people were utterly impoverished. The
parliament of England granted, and the nation paid such
incredible sums as enabled their sovereign not only to
maintain invincible navies and formidable armies, but
likewise to give subsidies to all the powers of Eu∣rope.
He knew that a treaty of this kind was actu∣ally
upon the anvil between his Britannick Majesty
and the Czarina, and he began to be apprehensive of
seeing an army of Russians in the Netherlands. His
fears from this quarter were not without foundation. In
the month of November, the Earl of Hyndford, ambas∣sador
from the King of Great-Britain at the court of Rus∣sia,
concluded a treaty of subsidy, by which the Czarina
engaged to hold in readiness thirty thousand men, and
forty gallies, to be employed in the service of the confe∣derates,
on the first requisition. The States-General
acceded to this agreement, and even consented to pay
one-fourth of the subsidy. His most Christian Majesty,
moved by these considerations, made further advances to∣wards
an accommodation both at the Hague and in Lon∣don;
and the contending powers agreed to another con∣gress,
which was actually opened in March at Aix-la-Chapelle,
where the Earl of Sandwich and Sir Thomas
Robinson assisted as plenipotentiaries from the King of
Great-Britain.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. The elections for the new parliament in
England had been conducted so as fully to answer the pur∣poses
of the Duke of Newcastle, and his brother Mr.
Pelham, who had for some time wholly engrossed the ad∣ministration.
Both Houses were assembled on the tenth
day of November, when Mr. Onslow was unanimously
<PB N="207" REF="213"/>
re-elected Speaker of the Commons. The session was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pened, as usual, by a speech from the throne, congratu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ting
them on the signal successes of the British navy,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd the happy alteration in the government of the United
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rovinces. His Majesty gave them to understand, that a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ngress would speedily be opened at Aix-la-Chapelle, to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oncert the means for effecting a general pacification; and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eminded them that nothing would more conduce to the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ccess of his negociation than the vigour and unanimity
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their proceedings. He received such addresses as the
ministers were pleased to dictate. Opposition now lan∣guished
at their feet. The Duke of Bedford was become
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> courtier, and in a little time appointed secretary of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ate, in the room of the Earl of Chesterfield, who had
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tely executed that office which he now resigned; and
the Earl of Sandwich no longer harangued against the ad∣ministration.
This new House of Commons, in imita∣tion
of the liberality of their predecessors, readily grati∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed
all the requests of the government. They voted forty
thousand seamen, forty-nine thousand land-forces, besides
eleven thousand five hundred marines; the subsidies for
the Queen of Hungary, the Czarina, the King of Sardinia,
the Electors of Mentz and Bavaria, the Hessians, and the
Duke of Wolfenbuttel: the sum of two hundred thirty-five
thousand seven hundred and forty-nine pounds was
granted to the provinces of New England, to re-emburse
them for the expense of reducing Cape-Breton: five hun∣dred
thousand pounds were given to his Majesty for the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gorous prosecution of the war; and about one hundred
and firty-two thousand pounds to the Scottish claimants,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lieu of their jurisdiction. The supplies for the ensuing
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear fell very little short of nine millions, of which the
greater part was raised on a loan by subscription, chargea∣ble
on a new subsidy of poundage exacted from all mer∣chandise
imported into Great-Britain. Immediately after
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rebellion was suppressed, the legislature had established
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me regulations in Scotland, which were thought necessa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
to prevent such commotions for the future. The High∣landers
<PB N="208" REF="214"/>
were disarmed, and an act passed, for abolishing
their peculiarity of garb, which was supposed to keep <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
party-distinctions, to encourage their martial disposition
and preserve the memory of the exploits atchieved by the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
ancestors. In this session a bill was brought in to enforc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
the execution of that law, and passed with another act, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the more effectual punishment of high treason in the
Highlands of Scotland. The practice of insuring French
and Spanish ships at London being deemed the sole cir∣cumstance
that prevented a total stagnation of comme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
in those countries, it was prohibited by law under seve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
penalties; and this step of the British parliament accele∣rated
the conclusion of the treaty. Several other prude<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
measures were taken in the course of this session, for the
benefit of the publick; and among these we may recke<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
an act for encouraging the manufacture of indigo in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
British plantations of North America; an article <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
which Great-Britain used to pay two hundred thousand
pounds yearly to the subjects of France. The session was
closed on the thirteenth day of May,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> when the King
declared to both Houses, that the preliminaries of a gene∣ral
peace were actually signed at Aix-la-Chapelle by the
ministers of Great-Britain, France, and the United-Pro∣vinces;
and that the basis of this accommodation was
general restitution of the conquests which had been made
during the war. Immediately after the prorogation of par∣liament
his majesty set out for his German dominions, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
having appointed a regency to rule the realm in his absen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪</P>
<P>§ XXX. The articles might have been much less un∣favourable
to Great-Britain and her allies, had the mi∣nistry
made a proper use of the treaty with the Czarin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
and if the confederates had acted with more vigo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
and expedition in the beginning of the campaign. The
Russian auxiliaries might have been transported by sea <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Lubeck before the end of the preceding summer, in the
own gallies, which had been lying ready for use since the
month of July. Had this expedient been used, the Rus∣sian
troops would have joined the confederate army before
<PB N="209" REF="215"/>
the conclusion of the last campaign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IX. 1748.</NOTE> But this easy and
expeditious method of conveyance was rejected for a
march by land, of incredible length and difficulty, which
could not be begun before the month of January, nor
accomplished till Midsummer. The operations of the
campaign had been concerted at the Hague in January,
by the respective ministers of the allies, who resolved to
bring an army of one hundred and ninety thousand men
into the Netherlands, in order to compel the French to
abandon the barrier which they had conquered. The
towns of Holland became the scenes of tumult and insur∣rection.
The populace plundered the farmers of the re∣venue,
abolished the taxes, and insulted the magistrates;
so that the States-General, seeing their country on the
brink of anarchy and confusion, authorized the Prince of
Orange to make such alterations as he should see conve∣nient.
They presented him with a diploma, by which
he was constituted hereditary stadtholder and captain-general
of Dutch Brabant, Flanders, and the upper quar∣ter
of Guelderland; and the East-India company ap∣pointed
him director and governor-general of their com∣merce
and settlements in the Indies. Thus invested
with an authority unknown to his ancestors, he exerted
himself with equal industry and discretion in new-model∣ling,
augmenting, and assembling the troops of the re∣publick.
The confederates knew that the Count de
Saxe had a design upon Maestricht: the Austrian gene∣ral
Bathiani made repeated remonstrances to the British
ministry, entreating them to take speedy measures for the
preservation of that fortress. He in the month of Janu∣ary
proposed that the Duke of Cumberland should cross
the sea, and confer with the Prince of Orange on this
subject: he undertook, at the peril of his head, to cover
Maestricht with seventy thousand men, from all attacks of
the enemy: but his representations seemed to have made
very little impression on those to whom they were addressed.
The Duke of Cumberland did not depart from England
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ill towards the latter end of February: part of March
<PB N="210" REF="216"/>
was elapsed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1748.</NOTE> before the transports sailed from the Nore with
the additional troops and artillery; and the last drafts
from the foot-guards were not embarked till the middle
of August.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. The different bodies of the confederate forces
joined each other, and encamped in the neighbourhood of
Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emond, to the number of one hundred and ten thou∣sand
men; and the French army invested Maestricht,
without opposition, on the third day of April. The gar∣rison
consisted of Imperial and Dutch troops, under the
conduct of the governour, Baron d'Aylva, who defended
the place with extraordinary skill and resolution. He
annoyed the besiegers in repeated sallies; but they were
determined to surmount all opposition, and prosecuted
their approaches with incredible ardour. They assaulted
the covered-way, and there effected a lodgment, after an
obstinate dispute, in which they lost two thousand of their
best troops: but, next day they were entirely dislodged
by the gallantry of the garrison. These hostilities were
suddenly suspended, in consequence of the preliminaries
signed at Aix-la-Chapelle. The plenipotentiaries agreed,
that, for the glory of his Christian Majesty's arms, the
town of Maestricht should be surrendered to his general, on
condition that it should be restored, with all the magazines
and artillery. He accordingly took possession of it on the
third day of May, when the garrison marched out with
all the honours of war; and a cessation of arms imme∣diately
ensued. By this time the Russian auxiliaries, to
the number of thirty-seven thousand, commanded by
Prince Repnin, had arrived in Moravia, where they were
reviewed by their Imperial Majesties: then they proceeded
to the confines of Franconia, where they were ordered to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alt, after they had marched seven hundred miles since
the beginning of the year. The French King declared,
that should they advance farther, he would demolish the
fortifications of Maestricht and Bergen-op zoom. This
dispute was referred to the plenipotentiaries, who, in the
beginning of August, concluded a convention, importing
<PB N="211" REF="217"/>
that the Russian troops should return to their own country;
and that the French King should disband and equal number
of his forces. The season being far advanced, the Russians
were provided with winter-quarters in Bohemia and Mo∣ravia,
where they continued till the spring, when they
marched back to Livonia. In the mean time seven-and-thirty
thousand French troops were withdrawn from Flan∣ders
into Picardy, and the two armies remained quiet till
the conclusion of the definitive treaty. The suspension of
arms was proclaimed at London, and in all the capitals of
the contracting powers: orders were sent to the respective
admirals in different parts of the world, to refrain from
hostilities; and a communication of trade and intelligence
was again opened between the nations which had been at
variance. No material transaction distinguished the cam∣paign
in Italy. The French and Spanish troops, who had
joined the Genoese in the territories of the republick,
amounted to thirty thousand men, under the direction of
the Duke de Richelieu, who was sent from France to
assume that command, on the death of the Duke de
Boufflers, while Mareschal de Belleisle, at the head of fifty
thousand men, covered the western Riviera, which was
threatened with an invasion by forty thousand Austrians
and Piedmontese, under General Leutrum. At the same
time General Brown, with a more numerous army, pre∣pared
to re-enter the eastern Riviera, and re-commence the
siege of Genoa. But these intended operations were pre∣vented
by an armistice, which took place as soon as the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elligerent powers had acceded to the preliminaries.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. In the East-Indies, Rear-Admiral Boscawen
undertook the siege of Pondicherry, which, in the month
of August, he blocked up by sea with his squadron, and
invested by land with a small army of four thousand Eu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>peans,
and about two thousand natives of that country.
He prosecuted the enterprise with great spirit, and took
he sort of Area Coupan, at the distance of three miles
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om the town: then he made his approaches to the place,
against which he opened batteries, while it was bombarded
<PB N="212" REF="218"/>
and cannonaded by the shipping. But the fortifications were
so strong, the garrison so numerous, and the engineers of
the enemy so expert in their profession, that he made very
little progress, and sustained considerable damage. At
length, his army being diminished by sickness, and the
rainy season approaching, he ordered the artillery and
stores to be re-embarked; and raising the siege on the sixth
day of October, returned to fort St. David, after having
lost about a thousand men in this expedition. In the
sequel, several ships of his squadron, and above twelve
hundred sailors, perished in a hurricane. The naval force
of Great-Britain was more successful in the West-Indies.
Rear-Admiral Knowles, with a squadron of eight ships,
attacked Fort Louis, on the south side of Hispaniola, which
after a warm action of three hours was surrendered on capi∣tulation,
and dismantled. Then he made an abortive
attempt upon St. Jago de Cuba, and returned to Jamaica,
extremely chagrined at his disappointment, which he im∣puted
to the misconduct of Captain Dent, who was tried
in England by a court-martial, and honourably acquitted.
On the first day of October, the same admiral cruising in
the neighbourhood of the Havannah, with eight ships of
the linc, encountered a Spanish squadron of nearly the
same strength, under the command of the Admirals Reggio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and Spinola. The engagement began between two and
three o'clock in the afternoon, and continued with inter∣vals
till eight in the evening, when the enemy retired to
the Havannah, with the loss of two ships; one of which
struck to the British admiral, and the other was, two days
after, set on fire by her own commander, that she might
not fall into the hands of the English. Mr. Knowles
taxed some of his captains with misbehaviour, and they re∣criminated
on his conduct. On their return to England,
a court-martial was the consequence of their mutual accusa∣tions.
Those who adhered to the commander, and the
others whom he impeached, were inflamed against each
other with the most rancorous resentment. The admiral
himself did not escape uncensured: two of his captain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="213" REF="219"/>
were reprimanded: but Captain Holmes, who had dis∣played
uncommon courage, was honourably acquitted.
Their animosities did not end with the court-martial. A
bloodless encounter happened between the admiral and
Captain Powlet: but Captain Innes and Captain Clarke,
meeting by appointment in Hyde-park with pistols, the
former was mortally wounded, and died next morning;
the latter was tried, and condemned for murther, but in∣dulged
with his Majesty's pardon. No naval transaction
of any consequence happened in the European seas, during
the course of this summer. In January, indeed, the Mag∣nanime,
a French ship of the line, was taken in the
channel by two English cruisers, after an obstinate engage∣ment;
and the privateers took a considerable number of
merchant ships from the enemy.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. The plenipotentiaries still continued at
Aix-la-Chapelle, discussing all the articles of the definitive
treaty, which was at length concluded and signed on the
seventh day of October. It was founded on former treaties,
which were now expressly confirmed, from that of West∣phalia
to the last concluded at London and Vienna. The
contracting parties agreed, That all prisoners on each side
should be mutually released, without ransom, and all con∣quests
restored: That the duchies of Parma, Placentia,
and Guastalla should be ceded as a settlement to the Infant
Don Philip, and the heirs-male of his body; but in case
of his ascending the throne of Spain, or of the two Sicilies,
or his dying without male-issue, that they should revert
to the house of Austria: That the King of Great-Britain
should, immediately after the ratification of this
treaty, send two persons of rank and distinction, to reside
in France, as hostages, until restitution should be made of
Cape-Breton, and all the other conquests which his Bri∣tannick
Majesty should have atchieved in the East or West-Indies,
before or after the preliminaries were signed▪
That the assiento contract, with the article of the annual
ship, should be confirmed for four years, during which the
enjoyment of that privilege was suspended since the com∣mencement
<PB N="214" REF="220"/>
of the present war: That Dunkirk should re∣main
fortified on the land side, and towards the sea conti∣nue
on the footing of former treaties. All the contracting
powers became guarantees to the King of Prussia for the
duchy of Silesia and the county of Glatz, as he at present
possessed them; and they likewise engaged to secure the
Empress-Queen of Hungary and Bohemia in possession of
her hereditary dominions, according to the pragmatick
sanction. The other articles regulated the forms and times
fixed for this mutual restitution, as well as for the termina∣tion
of hostilities in different parts of the world. But the
right of English subjects to navigate in the American seas,
without being subject to search, was not once mentioned,
though this claim was the original source of the differences
between Great-Britain and Spain: nor were the limits of
Acadia ascertained. This and all other disputes were left
to the discussion of commissaries. We have already ob∣served,
that after the troubles of the empire began, the war
was no longer maintained on British principles. It became
a continental contest, and was prosecuted on the side of
the allies without conduct, spirit, or unanimity. In the
Netherlands they were outnumbered and outwitted by the
enemy. They never hazarded a battle without sustaining a
defeat. Their vast armies, paid by Great-Britain, lay in∣active,
and beheld one fortress reduced after another, until
the whole country was subdued; and as their generals
fought their plenipotentiaries negociated. At a time
when their affairs began to wear the most promising aspect;
when the arrival of the Russian auxiliaries would have
secured an undoubted superiority in the field; when the
British fleets had trampled on the naval power of France
and Spain, intercepted their supplies of treasure, and cut
off all their resources of commerce; the British ministers
seemed to treat, without the least regard to the honour and
advantage of their country. They left their most valuable
and necessary rights of trade unowned and undecided:
they subscribed to the insolent demand of sending the nobles
of the realm to grace the court, and adorn the triumphs
<PB N="215" REF="221"/>
of her enemy: and they tamely gave up her conquests in
North-America, of more consequence to her traffick than
all the other dominions for which the powers at war con∣tended;
they gave up the important isle of Cape-Breton,
in exchange for a petty factory in the East-Indies, belong∣ing
to a private company, whose existence had been deem∣ed
prejudicial to the commonwealth. What then were the
fruits which Britain reaped from this long and desperate
war? A dreadful expense of blood and and treasure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such an expensive war could not be maintained without a very extra∣ordinary exertion of a commercial spirit: accordingly, we find that Great-Britain, since the death of King William, has risen under her pressures with increased vigour and perseverance.

From this article, the reader will conceive the prodigious extent and importance of the British commerce.</NOTE>, dis∣grace

<P>§ I. THE peace of Aix-la-Chapelle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK. III. 1748.</NOTE> however unstable
or inglorious it might appear to those few who
understood the interests, and felt for the honour of their
country, was nevertheless not unwelcome to the nation
in general. The British ministry will always find it more
difficult to satisfy the people at the end of a successful
campaign, than at the conclusion of an unfortunate war.
The English are impatient of miscarriage and disappoint∣ment,
and too apt to be intoxicated with victory. At
this period they were tired of the burthens, and sick of
the disgraces, to which they had been exposed in the course
of seven tedious campaigns. They had suffered consi∣derable
<PB N="219" REF="225"/>
losses and interruption in the article of commerce,
which was the source of their national opulence and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ower: they knew it would necessarily be clogged with
additional duties, for the maintenance of a continental
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar, and the support of foreign subsidiaries; and they
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew very faint presages of future success either from the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nduct of their allies, or the capacity of their command∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s.
To a people influenced by these considerations, the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>storation of a free trade, the respite from that anxiety and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>spense which the prosecution of a war never fails to en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ender,
and the prospect of a speedy deliverance from dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uraging
restraint and oppressive impositions, were ad∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>antages
that sweetened the bitter draught of a dishonour∣able
treaty, and induced the majority of the nation to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quiesce in the peace, not barely without murmuring,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut even with some degree of satisfaction and applause.</P>
<P>§ II. Immediately after the exchange of ratifications at
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix-la-Chapelle the armies were broke up: the allies in
the Netherlands withdrew their several proportions of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oops; the French began to evacuate Flanders; and the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nglish forces were re-embarked for their own country.
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Britannick Majesty returned from his German dominions
in November, having landed near Margate, in Kent,
after a dangerous passage; and on the twenty-ninth of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame month he opened the session of parliament. By this
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me the misunderstanding between the two first personages
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the royal family had been increased by a fresh accession
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f matter. The Prince of Wales had held a court of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>annary, in quality of Duke of Cornwall; and revived
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome claims attached to that dignity, which, had they
been admitted, would have greatly augmented his influ∣ence
among the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ornish boroughs. These efforts roused
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he jealousy of the administration, which had always con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dered
them as an interest wholly dependent on the crown;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, therefore, the pretensions of his royal highness were
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pposed by the whole weight of the ministry. His adhe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ents,
resenting these hostilities as an injury to their royal
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aster, immediately joined the remnant of the former
<PB N="220" REF="226"/>
opposition in parliament, and resolved to counteract <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the ministerial measures that should fall under their cog∣nizance;
at least, they determined to seise every oppor∣tunity
of thwarting the servants of the crown, in every
scheme or proposal that had not an evident tendency to
the advantage of the nation. This band of auxiliaries
was headed by the Earl of E—t, Dr. Lee, and Mr. N—t▪
The first possessed a species of eloquence rather plausible
than powerful: he spoke with fluency and fire: his spirit
was bold and enterprising, his apprehension quick, and his
repartee severe. Dr. Lee was a man of extensive erudition
and irreproachable morals, particularly versed in the civil
law, which he professed, and perfectly well acquainted
with the constitution of his country. Mr. N—t was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
orator of middling abilities, who harangued upon all
subjects indiscriminately, and supplied with confidence
what he wanted in capacity: he had been at some pain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to study the business of the House, as well as to understand
the machine of government; and was tolerably well heard,
as he generally spoke with an appearance of good-humour,
and hazarded every whimsical idea, as it rose in his imagi∣nation.
But Lord Bolingbroke is said to have been the
chief spring, which, in secret, actuated the deliberations
of the Prince's court. That nobleman, seemingly se∣questered
from the tumults of a publick life, resided at
Battersea, where he was visited like a sainted shrine by all
the distinguished votaries of wit, eloquence, and political
ambition. There he was cultivated and admired for the
elegance of his manners, and the charms of his conver∣sation.
The Prince's curiosity was first captivated by his
character, and his esteem was afterwards secured by the
irresistible address of that extraordinary personage, who
continued in a regular progression to insinuate himself still
farther and farther into the good graces of his royal patron.
How far the conduct of his royal highness was influenced
by the private advice of this nobleman we shall not pre∣tend
to determine: but, certain it is, the friends of the
ministry propagated a report, that he was the dictator of
<PB N="221" REF="227"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ose measures which the Prince adopted; and that, under
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> specious pretext of attachment to the heir apparent of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> crown, he concealed his real aim, which was to per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tuate
the breach in the royal family. Whatever his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ntiments and motives might have been, this was no other
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an a revival of the old ministerial clamour, that a man
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nnot be well affected to the King, if he pretends to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsure any measure of the administration.</P>
<P>§ III. The weight which the opposition derived from
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ese new confederates in the House of Commons was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill greatly overbalanced by the power, influence, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bility that sustained every ministerial project. Mr. Pel∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am,
who chiefly managed the helm of affairs, was gene∣rally
esteemed as a man of honesty and candour, actuated
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y a sincere love for his country, though he had been edu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ated
in erroneous principles of government, and in some
measure obliged to prosecute a fatal system, which descend∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
to him by inheritance. At this time he numbered Mr.
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itt among his fellow-ministers, and was moreover sup∣ported
by many other individuals of distinguished abilities;
among whom the first place, in point of genius, was due
to Mr. M. who executed the office of solicitor-general.
This gentleman, the son of a noble family in North Bri∣tain,
had raised himself to great eminence at the bar, by
a most keen intuitive spirit of apprehension, that seemed
to seise every object at first glance, an innate sagacity, that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aved the trouble of intense application, and an irresistible
stream of eloquence, that slowed pure and classical, strong
and copious, reflecting, in the most conspicuous point of
view, the subjects over which it rolled, and sweeping before
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t all the slime of formal hesitation, and all the entangling<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
weeds of chicanery. Yet, the servants of the crown
were not so implicitly attached to the first minister as to
acquiesce in all his plans, and dedicate their time and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alents to the support of every court-measure indiscrimi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ately.
This was one material point in which Mr. Pel∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am
deviated from the maxims of his predecessor, who
admitted of no contradiction from any of his adherents or
<PB N="220" REF="228"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="221" REF="229"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="222" REF="230"/>
fellow-servants, but insisted on sacrificing their whole per∣ception
and faculties to his conduct and disposal. That
fordid deference to a minister no longer characterised the
subordinate instruments of the administration. It was not
unusual to see the great officers of the government divided
in a parliamentary debate, and to hear the secretary at
war opposing with great vehemence a clause suggested by
the chancellor of the Exchequer. After all, if we coolly
consider those arguments which have been bandied about,
and retorted with such eagerness and acrimony in the
House of Commons, and divest them of those passionate
tropes and declamatory metaphors which the spirit of
opposition alone had produced, we shall find very little
left for the subject of dispute, and sometimes be puzzled
to discover any material source of disagreement.</P>
<P>§ IV. In the month of November his Majesty opened
the session of parliament with a speech, acquainting them,
That the definitive treaty of peace was at length signed
by all the parties concerned: That he had made the most
effectual provision for securing the rights and interests of
his own subjects; and procured for his allies the best con∣ditions,
which, in the present situation of affairs, could
be obtained. He said he had found a general good dispo∣sition
in all parties to bring the negociation to a happy
conclusion; and observed, that we might promise our∣selves
a long enjoyment of the blessings of peace. Finally,
after having remarked that times of tranquillity were the
proper seasons for lessening the national debt, and strength∣ening
the kingdom against future events, he recommended
to the Commons the improvement of the public revenue,
the maintenance of a considerable naval force, the ad∣vancement
of commerce, and the cultivation of the arts of
peace. This speech, as usual, was echoed back by an ad∣dress
to the throne from both Houses, containing general
expressions of the warmest loyalty and gratitude to his
Majesty, and implying the most perfect satisfaction and
acquiescence in the articles of the treaty of Aix-la-Cha∣pelle.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="231"/>
§ V. The members in the opposition, according to
custom, cavilled at the nature of this address. They
observed, that the late pacification was the worst and most
inglorious of all the bad treaties to which the English
nation had ever subscribed: that it was equally disgrace∣ful,
indefinite, and absurd: They said the British navy
had gained such an ascendancy over the French at sea,
that the sources of their wealth were already choaked up;
that the siege of Maestricht would have employed their
arms in the Low-Countries till the arrival of the Russians;
and that the accession of these auxiliaries would have
thrown the superiority into the scale of the allies. They
did not fail to take notice, that the most important and
original object of the war was left wholly undecided; and
demonstrated the absurdity of their promising, in the address,
to make good such engagements as his Majesty had entered
into with his allies, before they knew what those engage∣ments
were. In answer to these objections, the ministers
replied, That the peace was in itself rather better than
could be expected; and that the smallest delay might have
proved fatal to the liberties of Europe. They affirmed,
That the Dutch were upon the point of concluding a
neutrality, in consequence of which their troops would
have been withdrawn from the allied army; and, in that
case, even the addition of the Russian auxiliaries would
not have rendered it a match for the enemy. They asserted,
That if the war had been prolonged another year, the
national credit of Great Britain must have been entirely
ruined, many of the publick funds having sunk below par
in the preceding season, so that the ministry had begun to
despair of seeing the money paid in on the new subscription.
With respect to the restoration of Cape Breton, the limits
of Nova Scotia, and the right of navigating without
search in the American seas, which right had been left
unestablished in the treaty, they declared, That the first
was an unnecessary expense, of no consequence to Great-Britain;
and that the other two were points in dispute,
to be amicably settled in private conferences by commis∣saries
<PB N="224" REF="232"/>
duly authorized; but by no means articles to be
established by a general treaty.</P>
<P>§ VI. What the opposition wanted in strength <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
endeavoured to make up with spirit and perseverance.
Every ministerial motion and measure was canvassed,
sifted, and decried with uncommon art and vivacity: but
all this little availed against the single article of superior
numbers; and accordingly this was the source of certain
triumph in all debates in which the servants of the
crown were united. The nation had reason to expect <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
immediate mitigation in the article of annual expense,
considering the number of troops and ships of war which
had been reduced at the ratification of the treaty: but
they were disagreeably undeceived in finding themselves
again loaded with very extraordinary impositions, for the
payment of a vast debt which government had contracted
in the course of the war, notwithstanding the incredible
aids granted by parliament. The committee of supply
established four points of consideration in their delibera∣tions
concerning the sums necessary to be raised, namely,
for fulfilling the engagements which the parliament had
entered into with his Majesty, and the services undertaken
for the success of the war; for discharging debts con∣tracted
by government; for making good deficiencies; and
for defraying the current expense of the year. It appeared
that the nation owed four-and-forty thousand pounds to
the Elector of Bavaria; above thirty thousand to the
Duke of Brunswick; the like sum to the Landgrave o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Hesse-Cassel; and near nine thousand pounds to the Elector
of Mentz. The Queen of Hungary claimed an arrear of
one hundred thousand pounds. The city of Glasgow,
in North-Britain, presented a petition, praying to be re∣imbursed
the sum of ten thousand pounds, extorted from
that corporation by the son of the Pretender, during the
rebellion. One hundred and twelve thousand pounds
were owing to the forces in North-America and the East-Indies;
besides near half a million due on extraordinary
expense incurred by the land-forces in America, Flanders,
<PB N="225" REF="233"/>
and North-Britain, by the office of Ordnance, and other
services of the last year, to which the parliamentary pro∣vision
did not extend. The remaining debt of the Ord∣nance
amounted to above two hundred and thirty thousand
pounds: but the navy-bills could not be discharged for
less than four millions. An addition of two millions
three hundred and seventy-four thousand three hundred
thirty-three pounds fifteen shillings and two pence was also
required for the current service of the year. In a word, the
whole annual supply exceeded eight millions sterling—a
sum at which the whole nation expressed equal astonish∣ment
and disgust. It was charged upon the duties on malt,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um, cyder, and perry, the land-tax at four shillings in
the pound, annuities on the sinking fund, an application
of one million from that deposit, and a loan of the like sum
to be charged on the first aids of next session. The num∣ber
of seamen was reduced to seventeen thousand, and
that of the land forces to eighteen thousand eight hundred
and fifty-seven, including guards and garrisons.</P>
<P>§ VII. Every article of expense, however, was warmly
disputed by the anti-courtiers; especially the demand of
the Queen of Hungary, which was deemed unreasonably
exorbitant and rapacious, considering the seas of blood
which we had shed, and the immensity of treasure we
had exhausted for her benefit: and surely the subjects of
this nation had some reason to complain of an indulgence
of this nature, granted to a power which they had literally
snatched from the brink of ruin—a power whose quarrel
they had espoused with a degree of enthusiasm that did
much more honour to their gallantry than to their discre∣tion—
a power that kept aloof, with a stateliness of pride
peculiar to herself and family, and beheld her British aux∣iliaries
fighting her battles at their own expense; while
she squandered away, in the idle pageantry of barbarous
magnificence, those ample subsidies which they advanced
in order to maintain her armies, and furnish out her pro∣portion
of the war. The leaders of the opposition ne∣glected
no opportunity of embittering the triumphs of
<PB N="226" REF="234"/>
their adversaries: they inveighed against the extravagance
of granting sixteen thousand pounds for the pay of gene∣ral
and staff officers during a peace that required no such
establishment, especially at a juncture when the national
incumbrances rendered it absolutely necessary to practise
every expedient of oeconomy. They even combated the
request of the city of Glasgow to be indemnified for the
extraordinary exaction it underwent from the rebels,
though it appeared, from unquestionable evidence, that
this extraordinary contribution was exacted on account of
that city's peculiar attachment to the reigning family:
that it had always invariably adhered to Revolution prin∣ciples;
and, with an unequalled spirit of loyalty and zeal
for the protestant succession, distinguished itself both in
the last and preceding rebellion.</P>
<P>§ VIII. But the most violent contest arose on certain
regulations which the ministry wanted to establish in two
bills, relating to the sea and land service. The first, un∣der
the title of a bill for amending, explaining, and re∣ducing
into one act of parliament the laws relating to
the navy, was calculated solely with a view of subjecting
half-pay officers to martial law—a design which not only
furnished the opposition with a plausible handle for accus∣ing
the ministers, as intending to encroach upon the con∣stitution,
in order to extend the influence of the crown;
but also alarmed the sea-officers to such a degree, that
they assembled to a considerable number, with a view to
deliberate upon the proper means for defending their privi∣leges
and liberties from invasion. The result of their con∣sultations
was a petition to the House of Commons, sub∣scribed
by three admirals and forty-seven captains, not mem∣bers
of parliament, representing, That the bill in agitation
contained several clauses tending to the injury and dishonour
of all naval officers, as well as to the detriment of his Ma∣jesty's
service; and that the laws already in force had been
always found effectual for securing the service of officers on
half-pay, upon the most pressing occasions: they, therefore,
hoped, that they should not be subjected to new hardships
<PB N="227" REF="235"/>
and discouragements; and begged to be heard by their coun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el,
before the committee of the whole House, touching
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch parts of the bill as they apprehended would be inju∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious
to themselves and the other officers of his Majesty's
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avy. This petition was presented to the House by Sir
John Norris, and the motion for its being read was se∣conded
by Sir Peter Warren, whose character was uni∣versally
esteemed and beloved in the nation. This measure
had like to have produced very serious consequences. Many
commanders and subalterns had repaired to the Admiralty,
and threatened, in plain terms, to throw up their commis∣sions
in case the bill should pass into a law; and a general
ferment was begun among all the subordinate members of
the navy. A motion was made, That the petitioners,
according to their request, should be heard by their coun∣sel;
and this proposal was strongly urged by the first ora∣tors
of the antiministerial association; but the minister,
confiding in his own strength, re-enforced by the abili∣ties
of Mr. Pitt, Mr. Lyttelton, and Mr. Fox, the se∣cretary
of war, strenuously opposed the motion, which,
upon a division, was thrown out by a great majority.
The several articles of the bill were afterwards separately
debated with great warmth; and though Mr. Pelham had,
with the most disinterested air of candour, repeatedly de∣clared
that he required no support, even from his own
adherents, but that which might arise from reason unre∣strained,
and full conviction, he, on this occasion, reaped
all the fruit from their zeal and attachment which could
be expected from the most implicit complaisance. Some
plausible amendments of the most exceptionable clauses
were offered, particularly of that which imposed an oath
upon the members of every court-martial, that they should
not, on any account, disclose the opinions or transactions of
any such tribunal. This was considered as a sanction under
which any court-martial might commit the most flagrant
acts of injustice and oppression, which even parliament
itself could not redress, because it would be impossible
to ascertain the truth, eternally sealed up by this absurd
<PB N="228" REF="236"/>
obligation. The amendment proposed was, that the
member of a court-martial might reveal the transactions
and opinions of it, in all cases wherein the courts of jus∣tice,
as the law now stands, have a right to interfere, if
required thereto by either House of parliament: a very
reasonable mitigation, which, however, was rejected by
the majority. Nevertheless, the suspicion of an intended
encroachment had raised such a clamour without doors,
and diffused the odium of this measure so generally, that
the minister thought proper to drop the projected article
of war, subjecting the reformed officers of the navy to the
jurisdictions of courts-martial; and the bill being also
softened in other particulars, during its passage through
the Upper House, at length received the royal assent.</P>
<P>§ IX. The flame which this act had kindled was
rather increased than abated on the appearance of a new
mutiny-bill, replete with divers innovations, tending to
augment the influence of the crown, as well as the autho∣rity
and power of a military jurisdiction. All the articles
of war established since the reign of Charles the Second
were submitted to the inspection of the Commons; and
in these appeared a gradual spirit of encroachment, almost
imperceptibly deviating from the civil institutes of the
English constitution towards the establishment of a mi∣litary
dominion. By this new bill a power was vested in
any commander in chief to revise and correct any legal
sentence of a court-martial, by which the members
of such a court, corresponding with the nature of a
civil jury, were rendered absolutely useless, and the com∣mander
in a great measure absolute; for he had not only
the power of summoning such officers as he might choose
to sit on any trial, a prerogative unknown to any civil
court of judicature: but he was also at liberty to re∣view
and alter the sentence; so that a man was sub∣ject
to two trials for the same offence, and the commander
in chief was judge both of the guilt and the punishment.
By the final clause of this bill, martial law was extended
to all officers on half-pay; and the same arguments which
<PB N="229" REF="237"/>
had been urged against this article in the navy-bill were
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow repeated and re-enforced with redoubled fervour.
Many reasons were offered to prove that the half-pay was
allotted as a recompense for past service; and the oppo∣nents
of the bill affirmed, that such an article, by aug∣menting
the dependents of the crown, might be very dan∣gerous
to the constitution. On the other hand, the partisans
of the ministry asserted that the half-pay was granted as a
retaining fee: and that originally all those who enjoyed
this indulgence were deemed to be in actual service, con∣sequently
subject to martial law. Mr. Pitt, who at
this time exercised the office of paymaster-general with a
rigour of integrity unknown to the most disinterested of
all his predecessors in that department, espoused the
caluse in dispute, as a necessary extension of military
discipline, which could never be attended with any bad
consequence to the liberty of the nation. The remarks
which he made on this occasion implied an opi∣nion
that our liberties wholly existed in dependence
upon the direction of the sovereign, and the virtue
of the army. “To that virtue (said he) we trust even
at this hour, small as our army is—to that virtue we
must have trusted, had this bill been modelled as its
warmest opposers could have wished; and without this
virtue, should the Lords, the Commons, and the people
of England entrench themselves behind parchment up
to the teeth, the sword will find a passage to the vitals
of the constitution.” All the disputed articles of the
bill being sustained on the shoulders of a great majority,
it was conveyed to the Upper House, where it excited
another violent contest. Upon the question whether
officers on half-pay had not been subject to martial law,
the judges were consulted and divided in their sentiments.
The Earl of Bath declared his opinion, that martial law
did not extend to reformed officers; and opened all the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luices of his ancient eloquence. He admitted a case
which was urged of seven officers on half-pay, who,
being taken in actual rebellion at Preston, in the year
<PB N="230" REF="238"/>
1715, had been executed on the spot by martial law, in
consequence of the King's express order. He candidly
owned, that he himself was secretary at war at that
period: that he had approved of this order, and even
transmitted it to General Carpenter, who commanded at
Preston; but now his opinion was entirely changed. He
observed, that when the forementioned rebellion first broke
out, the House presented an address to the King, desiring
his Majesty would be pleased to employ all half-pay
officers, and gratify them with whole pay; and, indeed,
all such officers were voted on whole pay, by the House of
Commons. They were afterwards apprised of this vote,
by an advertisement in the Gazette, and ordered to hold
themselves in readiness to repair to such places as should
be appointed; and finally commanded to repair by such a
day to those places, on pain of being struck off the half∣pay
list. These precautions would have been unnecessary,
had they been deemed subject to martial law; and the
penalty for non-obedience would not have been merely a
privation of their pensions, but they would have fallen
under the punishment of death, as deserters from the
service. His lordship distinguished, with great propriety
and precision, between a step which had been precipi∣tately
taken in a violent crisis, when the publick was
heated with apprehension and resentment, and a solemn
law concerted at leisure, during the most profound tran∣quillity.
Notwithstanding the spirited opposition of this
nobleman, and some attempts to insert additional clauses,
the bill, having undergone a few inconsiderable amend∣ments,
passed by a very considerable majority.</P>
<P>§ X. Immediately after the mutiny bill had passed the
Lower House, another fruitless effort was made by the
opposition. The danger of a standing army, on whose
virtue the constitution of Great-Britain seemed to depend,
did not fail to alarm the minds of many who were zealously
attached to the liberties of their country, and gave birth
to a scheme, which, if executed, would have enabled the
legislature to establish a militia that must have answered
<PB N="231" REF="239"/>
many national purposes, and acted as a constitutional bul∣wark
against the excesses and ambition of a military stand∣ing
force, under the immediate influence of government.
The scheme which patriotism conceived was, in all proba∣bility,
adopted by party. A bill was brought in, limiting
the time beyond which no soldier, or non-commissioned
officer, should be compelled to continue in the service.
Had this limitation taken place, such a rotation of soldiers
would have ensued among the common people, that in a
few years every peasant, labourer, and inferior tradesman
in the kingdom would have understood the exercise of
arms: and perhaps the people in general would have con∣cluded
that a standing army was altogether unnecessary.
A project of this nature could not, for obvious reasons, be
agreeable to the administration, and therefore the bill was
rendered abortive; for, after having been twice read, it was
postponed from time to time, till the parliament was pro∣rogued,
and never appeared in the sequel. Such were the
chief subjects of debate between the ministry and the op∣position,
composed, as we have already observed, of the
Prince's servants and the remains of the country party,
this last being headed by Lord Strange, son of the Earl of
Derby, and Sir Francis Dashwood; the former a noble∣man
of distinguished abilities, keen, penetrating, eloquent,
and sagacious; the other frank, spirited, and sensible.</P>
<P>§ XI. It must be owned, however, for the honour of
the ministry, that, if they carried a few unpopular mea∣sures
with a high hand, they seemed earnestly desirous of
making amends to the nation, by promoting divers regu∣lations
for the benefit and improvement of commerce,
which actually took place in the ensuing session of parlia∣ment.
One of the principal objects of this nature which
fell under their cognizance, was the trade to the coast of
Guinea; a very important branch of traffick, whether
considered as a market for British manufactures, or as the
source that supplied the English plantations with negroes.
This was originally monopolised by a joint-stock com∣pany,
which had from time to time derived considerable
sums from the legislature, for enabling them the better to
<PB N="232" REF="240"/>
support certain forts or castles on the coast of Africa, to
facilitate the commerce and protect the merchants. In the
sequel, however, the exclusive privilege having been
judged prejudicial to the national trade, the coast was laid
open to all British subjects indiscriminately, on condition
of their paying a certain duty towards defraying the ex∣pense
of the forts and factories. This expedient did not
answer the purposes for which it had been contrived.
The separate traders, instead of receiving any benefit
from the protection of the company, industriously avoided
their castles, as the receptacles of tyranny and oppression.
The company, whether from the misconduct or knavery
of their directors, contracted such a load of debts as their
stock was unable to discharge. They seemed to neglect
the traffick, and allowed the castles to decay. In a word,
their credit being exhausted, and their creditors growing
clamorous, they presented a petition to the House of Com∣mons,
disclosing their distresses, and imploring such assist∣ance
as should enable them not only to pay their debts, but
also to maintain the forts in a defensible condition. This
petition, recommended to the House in a message from his
Majesty, was corroborated by another in behalf of the
company's creditors. Divers merchants of London, in∣terested
in the trade to Africa and the British plantations
in America, petitioned the House, that as the African trade
was of the utmost importance to the nation, and could not
be supported without sorts and settlements, some effectual
means should be speedily taken for protecting and extend∣ing
this valuable branch of commerce. A fourth was
offered by the merchants of Liverpool, representing, that,
the security and protection of the trade to Africa must
always principally depend upon his Majesty's ships of war
being properly stationed on that coast, and seasonably
relieved; and that such forts and settlements as might be
judged necessary for marks of sovereignty and possession
would prove a nuisance, and a burthen to the trade, should
they remain in the hands of any joint-stock company, whose
private interest always had been, and ever would be, found
<PB N="233" REF="241"/>
incompatible with the interest of the separate and open
trader. They, therefore, prayed that the said forts might
either be taken into his Majesty's immediate possession,
and supported by the publick, or committed to the mer∣chants
trading on that coast, in such a manner as the
House should judge expedient, without vesting in them
any other advantage, or right to the commerce, but what
should be common to all his Majesty's subjects. This
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emonstrance was succeeded by another, to the same effect,
from the master, wardens, assistants, and commonalty of
the society of merchant adventures within the city of
Bristol. All these petitions were referred to a committee
appointed to deliberate on this subject; who agreed to
certain resolutions, implying, That the trade to Africa
should be free and open; That the British forts and set∣tlements
on that coast ought to be maintained, and put
under proper direction; and, That, in order to carry on
the African trade in the most beneficial manner to these
kingdoms, all the British subjects trading to Africa should
be united in one open company, without any joint-stock,
or power to trade as a corporation. A bill was imme∣diately
founded on these resolutions, which alarmed the
company to such a degree, that they had recourse to an∣other
petition, demonstrating their right to the coast of
Africa, and expressing their reliance on the justice of the
House, that they should not be deprived of their property
without an adequate consideration. In a few days a second
address was offered by their creditors, complaining of the
company's mismanagement, promising to surrender their
right, as the wisdom of parliament should prescribe;
praying that their debts might be enquired into; and that
the equivalent to be granted for the company's possessions
might be secured and applied, in the first place, for their
benefit. The Commons, in consequence of this petition,
ordered the company to produce a list of their debts, to∣gether
with a copy of their charter, and two remon∣strances
which their creditors had presented to them before
this application to parliament. A committee of the whole
<PB N="234" REF="242"/>
House, having deliberated on these papers and petitions<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and heard the company by their counsel, resolved to give
them a reasonable compensation for their charter, lands,
forts, settlements, slaves, and effects, to be, in the first
place, applied towards the payment of their creditors. A
bill being formed accordingly, passed the Commons, and
was conveyed to the Upper House, where a great many
objections were started; and for the present it was drop∣ped,
until a more unexceptionable plan should be con∣certed.
In the mean time their lordships addressed his
Majesty, That the lords commissioners for trade and
plantations might be directed to prepare a scheme on this
subject, to be laid before both Houses of parliament at
the beginning of next session; That instant orders should
be given for preserving and securing the forts and settle∣ments
on the coast of Guinea belonging to Great-Britain▪
and, That proper persons should be appointed to examine
into the condition of those forts, as well as of the military
stores, slaves, and vessels belonging to the African com∣pany,
so as to make a faithful report of these particulars,
with all possible expedition.</P>
<P>§ XII. The ministry having professed an inclination,
and indeed shown a disposition, to promote and extend the
commerce of the kingdom, the Commons resolved to take
some steps for encouraging the white fishery along the
northern coast of the island, which is an inexhaustible
source of wealth to our industrious neighbours the Dutch,
who employ annually a great number of hands and vessels
in this branch of commerce. The sensible part of the
British people, reflecting on this subject, plainly foresaw
that a fishery under due regulations, undertaken with the
protection and encouragement of the legislature, would
not only prove a fund of national riches, and a nursery
of seamen; but likewise, in a great measure, prevent
any future insurrections in the Highlands of Scotland, by
diffusing a spirit of industry among the natives of that
country, who, finding it in their power to become inde∣pendent,
on the fruits of their own labour, would soon
<PB N="235" REF="243"/>
infranchise themselves from that slavish attachment by
which they had been so long connected with their land∣lords
and chieftains. Accordingly, a committee was ap∣pointed
to deliberate on the state of the British fishery;
and upon their report a bill was founded for encouraging
the whale fishery on the coast of Spitsbergen, by a bounty
of forty shillings per ton for every ship equipped for that
undertaking. The bill having made its way through both
Houses, and obtained the royal assent, the merchants in
different parts of the kingdom, particularly in North-Britain,
began to build and fit out ships of great burthen,
and peculiar structure, for the purposes of that fishery,
which ever since hath been carried on with equal vigour
and success. Divers merchants and traders of London
having presented to the House of Commons a petition,
representing the benefits that would accrue to the com∣munity
from a herring and cod fishery, established on
proper principles, and carried on with skill and integrity,
this remonstrance was referred to a committee, upon
whose resolutions a bill was formed; but, before this could
be discussed in the House, the parliament was prorogued,
and of consequence this measure proved abortive.</P>
<P>§ XIII. The next regulation proposed in favour of
trade, was that of laying open the commerce of Hudson's
Bay, in the most northern parts of America, where a small
monopoly maintained a few forts and settlements, and
prosecuted a very advantageous fur-trade with the
Indians of that continent. It was suggested, that the
company had long ago enriched themselves by their exclu∣sive
privilege; that they employed no more than four
annual ships; that, contrary to an express injunction in
their charter, they discouraged all attempts to discover a
north-west passage to the East-Indies; that they dealt
cruelly and perfidiously with the poor Indians, who never
traded with them, except when compelled by necessity, so
that the best part of the fur-trade had devolved to the ene∣mies
of Great-Britain; and that their exclusive patent
restricted to very narrow limits a branch of commerce,
<PB N="236" REF="244"/>
which might be cultivated to a prodigious extent, as well
as to the infinite advantage of Great-Britain. Petitions,
that the trade of Hudson's-Bay might be laid open, were
presented to the House by the merchants of London, Great
Yarmouth, and Wolverhampton; and a committee was
appointed to deliberate upon this subject. On the other
hand, the company exerted themselves in petitions and
private applications for their own preservation. The com∣mittee
examined many papers and records; and the report
was taken into consideration by the whole House. Many
evidences were interrogated, and elaborate speeches made,
on both sides of the question. At length the majority
seemed satisfied that the traffick on the coast of Hudson's.
Bay could not be preserved without forts and settlements,
which must be maintained either by an exclusive company
or at the publick expense; and, as this was not judged a
proper juncture to encumber the nation with any charge
of that kind, the design of dissolving the company was laid
aside till a more favourable opportunity.</P>
<P>§ XIV. The government had, during the war, found
great difficulty in pressing men for the service of the navy—
a practice, which, however sanctioned by necessity, is
nevertheless a flagrant encroachment on the liberty of the
subject, and a violent outrage against the constitution of
Great-Britain. The ministry, therefore, had employed
some of their agents to form a scheme for retaining in
time of peace, by means of a certain allowance, a number
of seamen, who should be registered for the purpose, and
be ready to man a squadron upon any emergency. Such
a plan, properly regulated, would have been a great ad∣vantage
to commerce, which is always distressed by the
practice of pressing seamen; and at the same time, a
great security to the kingdom in dangerous conjunctures,
when it may be necessary to equip an armament at a mi∣nute's
warning. The House of Commons being moved
upon this subject, agreed to divers resolutions, as a founda∣tion
for the bill: but the members in the opposition assect∣ing
to represent this measure in an odious light, as an
<PB N="237" REF="245"/>
limitation of the French method of registring seamen
without their own consent, Mr. Pelham dropped it, as an
unpopular project.</P>
<P>§ XV. Information having been received, that the
French intended to settle the neutral islands of St. Lucia,
Dominica, St. Vincent, and Tobago, in the West-Indies,
the nation had taken the alarm in the beginning of the
year; and a motion was made in the House of Commons
to address his Majesty, that he would be graciously pleased
to give directions for laying before the House copies of the
instructions given to the governors of Barbadoes for ten
years last past, so far as they related to these neutral
islands: but whether the minister was conscious of a
neglect in this particular, or thought such enquiries
trenched upon the prerogative, he opposed the motion with
all his might; and, after some debate, the previous ques∣tion
passed in the negative. This was also the fate of
another motion made by the Earl of E—t for an address,
entreating his Majesty would submit to the inspection of
the House all the proposals of peace that had been made
by the French King since the year which preceded the
last rebellion, to that in which the definitive treaty was
concluded at Aix-la Chapelle. This they proposed as a
previous step to the parliament's forming any opinion con∣cerning
the utility or necessity of the peace which had been
established. Violent debates ensued, in which the oppo∣sition
was as much excelled in oratory as out-numbered in
votes. Such were the material transactions of this session,
which in the month of June was closed as usual with a
speech from the throne; in which his Majesty signified
his hope, that the parliament, at their next meeting,
would be able to perfect what they had now begun for
advancing the trade and navigation of the kingdom. He
likewise expressed his satisfaction at seeing publick credit
flourish at the end of an expensive war; and recommended
unanimity, as the surest bulwark of national security.</P>
<P>§ XVI. While the ministry, on some occasions, ex∣hibited
all the external signs of moderation and good
<PB N="238" REF="246"/>
humour; they, on others, manifested a spirit of jealousy
and resentment, which seems to have been childish and
illiberal. Two or three young riotous students at Oxford,
trained up in prejudice, and heated with intemperance,
uttered some expressions over their cups, implying their
attachment to the family of the Pretender. The report
of this indiscretion was industriously circulated by certain
worthless individuals, who, having no reliance on their
own intrinsick merit, hoped to distinguish themselves as the
tools of party, and to obtain favour with the ministry by
acting as volunteers in the infamous practice of informa∣tion.
Though neither the age, rank, nor connexions
of the delinquents were such as ought to have attracted
the notice of the publick, the vice-chancellor, heads of
houses, and proctors of the university, knowing the in∣vidious
scrutiny to which their conduct was subjected,
thought proper to publish a declaration, signifying their
abhorrence of all seditious practices, their determined re∣solution
to punish all offenders to the utmost severity and
rigour of the statutes; and containing peremptory orders
for the regulation of the university. Notwithstanding
these wise and salutary precautions, the three boys, who,
in the heat of their intoxication, had drunk the Pretend∣er's
health, were taken into custody by a messenger of
state; and two of them being tryed in the court of King's-Bench,
and found guilty, were sentenced to walk through
the courts of Westminister, with a specification of their
crime fixed to their foreheads; to pay a fine of five nobles
each; to be imprisoned for two years, and find security
for their good behaviour for the term of seven years after
their enlargement. Many people thought they saw the
proceedings of the star-chamber revived in the severity of
this punishment. The administration, not yet satisfied
with the vengeance which had been taken on these three
striplings, seemed determined to stigmatize the university
to which they belonged. The cry of Jacobitism was
loudly trumpeted against the whole community. The
address of the university, congratulating his Majesty on
<PB N="239" REF="247"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he establishment of the peace, was rejected with disdain,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd an attempt was made to subject their statues to the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nspection of the King's council: but this rule, being
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgued in the court of King's-Bench, was dismissed, in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onsequence of the opinions given by the judges. Finally,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he same tribunal granted an information against Dr.
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urnel, the vice-chancellor, for his behaviour in the case
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the rioters above-mentioned: but this was counter∣manded
in the sequel, his conduct appearing unexception∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble
upon a more cool and impartial enquiry.</P>
<P>§ XVII. In proportion as Oxford declined, her sister∣university
rose in the favour of the administration, which
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he at this period cultivated by an extraordinary mark of
compliance and attachment. The dignity of Chancellor
of the university being vacated by the death of the Duke
of Somerset, the nation in general seemed to think it
would naturally devolve upon the Prince of Wales, as a
compliment at all times due to that rank; but more espe∣cially
to the then heir apparent, who had eminently
distinguished himself by the virtues of a patriot and a
prince. He had even pleased himself with the hope of
receiving this mark of attachment from a seminary for
which he entertained a particular regard. But the ruling
members, seeing no immediate prospect of advantage in
glorifying even a prince, who was at variance with the mi∣nistry,
wisely turned their eyes upon the illustrious charac∣ter
of the Duke of Newcastle, whom they elected without
opposition, and installed with great magnificence; learning,
poetry, and eloquence, joining their efforts in celebrating
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he shining virtues and extraordinary talents of their new
patron.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. Although opposition lay gasping at the feet
of power in the House of Commons, the people of
England did not yet implicity approve all the measures of
the administration; and the dregs of faction, still agi∣tated
by an internal ferment, threw up some ineffectual
bubbles in different parts of the kingdom. Some of those
who made no secret of their disaffection to the reigning
family determined to manifest their resentment and con∣tempt
<PB N="240" REF="248"/>
of certain noblemen, and others, who were said to
have abandoned their ancient principles, and to have sacri∣ficed
their consciences to their interest. Many individuals,
animated by the fumes of inebriation, now loudly extolled
that cause which they durst not avow when it required
their open approbation and assistance; and, though they
industriously avoided exposing their lives and fortunes to
the chance of war in promoting their favourite interest
when there was a possibility of success, they betrayed no
apprehension in celebrating the memory of its last effort,
amidst the tumult of a riot, and the clamours of intem∣perance.
In the neighbourhood of Lichfield the sports∣men
of the party appeared in the Highland taste of va∣riegated
drapery; and their zeal descending to a very ex∣traordinary
exhibition of practical ridicule, they hunted,
with hounds clothed in plaid, a fox dressed in red uni∣form.
Even the females at their assembly, and the gen∣tlemen
at the races, affected to wear the checquered stuff
by which the Prince Pretender and his followers had been
distinguished. Divers noblemen on the course were in∣sulted
as apostates; and one personage, of high rank, is
said to have undergone a very disagreeable flagellation.</P>
<P>§ XIX. As the publick generally suffers at the end of a
war, by the sudden dismission of a great number of soldiers
and seamen, who, having contracted a habit of idleness,
and finding themselves without employment and the means
of subsistence, engage in desperate courses, and prey upon
the community, it was judged expedient to provide an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
opening, through which these unquiet spirits might ex∣hale
without damage to the commonwealth. The most
natural was that of encouraging them to become members
of a new colony in North America, which, being pro∣perly
regulated, supported, and improved might be the
source of great advantage to its mother country. Many
disputes had arisen between the subjects of England and
France, concerning the limits of Nova-Scotia, which n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
treaty had as yet properly ascertained. A sort had been
raised, and a small garrison maintained, by the King of
<PB N="241" REF="249"/>
Great-Britain, at a part of this very country, called
Annapolis-Royal, to overawe the French neutrals settled
in the neighbourhood: but this did not answer the pur∣pose
for which it was intended. Upon every rupture of
dispute between the two crowns, these planters, forgetting
their neutrality, intrigued with the Indians, communi∣cated
intelligence to their own countrymen settled at St.
John's and Cape-Breton, and did all the ill-offices their
hatred could suggest against the colonies and subjects of
Great-Britain. A scheme was now formed for making a
new establishment on the same peninsula, which should
further confirm and extend the property and dominion of
the crown of Great-Britain in that large tract of country,
clear the uncultivated grounds, constitute communities,
diffuse the benefits of population and agriculture, and im∣prove
the fishery of that coast, which might be rendered a
new source of wealth and commerce to Old England. The
particulars of the plan being duly considered, it was laid
before his Majesty, who approved of the design, and re∣ferred
the execution of it to the board of trade and plan∣tations,
over which the Earl of Hallifax presided. This
nobleman, endued by nature with an excellent capacity,
which had been diligently and judiciously cultivated, ani∣mated
with liberal sentiments, and fired with an eager
spirit of patriotism, adopted the plan with the most gene∣rous
ardour, and cherished the infant colony with paternal
affection. The commissioners for trade and plantations
immediately advertised, under the sanction of his Majesty's
authority, That proper encouragement would be given to
such of the officers and private men, lately dismissed from
the land and sea-service, as were willing to settle, with
or without families, in the province of Nova-Scotia:
That the see-simple, or perpetual property, of fifty acres
of land should be granted to every private soldier or sea∣man,
free from the payment of any quit-rents or taxes, for
the term of ten years; at the expiration of which no per∣son
should pay more than one shilling per annum for every
fifty acres so granted: That, over and above these fifty.
<PB N="242" REF="250"/>
each person should receive a grant of ten acres for every
individual, including women and children, of which his
family should consist: that further grants should be made
to them as the number should increase, and in proportion as
they should manifest their abilities in agriculture: That
every officer, under the rank of ensign in the land service,
or lieutenant in the navy, should be gratified with four∣score
acres on the same conditions: That two hundred
acres should be bestowed upon ensigns, three hundred
upon lieutenants, four hundred upon captains, and six
hundred on every officer above that degree, with propor∣tionable
considerations for the number and increase of
every family: That the lands should be parcelled out as
soon as possible after the arrival of the colonists, and a
civil government established; by virtue of which they
should enjoy all the liberties and privileges of British sub∣jects,
with proper security and protection: That the
settlers, with their families, should be conveyed to Nova-Scotia,
and maintained for twelve months after their
arrival at the expense of the government; which should
also supply them with arms and ammunition, as far as
should be judged necessary for their defence, with proper
materials and utensils for clearing and cultivating their
lands, erecting habitations, exercising the fishery, and
such other purposes should be judged necessary for their
support.</P>
<P>§ XX. The scheme was so feasible, and the encourage∣ment
so inviting, that in a little time about four thousand
adventurers, with their families, were entered, according
to the directions of the board of trade, who in the begin∣ning
of May set sail from England, under the command
of Colonel Cornwallis, whom the King had appointed
their governor, and towards the latter end of June arrived
at the place of their destination, which was the harbour of
Chebuctou, on the sea-coast of the peninsula, about mid∣way
between Cape Cançeau and Cape Sable. It is one
of the most secure and commodious havens in the whole
world, and well situated for the fishery: yet the climate is
<PB N="243" REF="251"/>
cold, the soil barren, and the whole country covered with
woods of birch, fir, pine, and some oak, unfit for the
purposes of timber; but at the same time extremely diffi∣cult
to remove and extirpate. Governor Cornwallis no
sooner arrived in this harbour than he was joined by two
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egiments of infantry from Cape-Breton, and a company
of rangers from Annapolis. Then he pitched upon a spot
for the settlement, and employed his people in clearing
the ground for laying the foundations of a town; but
some inconveniencies being discovered in this situation,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e chose another to the northward, hard by the harbour,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n an easy ascent, commanding a prospect of the whole
peninsula, and well supplied with rivulets of fresh and
wholesome water. Here he began to build a town, on a
regular plan, to which he gave the name of Hallifax, in
honour of the nobleman who had the greatest share in
founding the colony; and before the approach of win∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er
above three hundred comfortable wooden houses
were built, the whole surrounded by a strong palisade.
This colony, however, has by no means answered the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anguine expectations of the projectors; for, notwith∣standing
the ardour with which the interests of it were
promoted by its noble patron, and the repeated indul∣gence
it has reaped from the bounty of the legislature, the
inhabitants have made little or no progress in agricul∣ture:
the fishery is altogether neglected, and the settle∣ment
entirely subsists on the sums expended by the indi∣viduals
of the army and navy, whose duty obliges them
to reside in this part of North-America.</P>
<P>§ XXI. The establishment of such a powerful colony
in Nova-Scotia could not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail giving umbrage to the
French in that neighbourhood, who, though they did
not think proper to promulgate their jealousy and disgust,
nevertheless employed their emissaries clandestinely in sti∣mulating
and exciting the Indians to harrass the colonists
with hostilities, in such a manner as should effectually
under them from extending their plantations, and per∣haps
induce them to abandon the settlement. Nor was
<PB N="244" REF="252"/>
this the only part of America in which the French court
countenanced such perfidious practices. More than ever
convinced of the importance of a considerable navy, and
an extensive plantation trade, they not only exerted un∣common
industry in re-establishing their marine, which
had suffered so severely during the war; but they resolved,
if possible, to extend their plantations in the West-In∣dies,
by settling the neutral islands, which we have
already mentioned. In the beginning of the year the
governour of Barbadoes, having received intelligence that
the French had begun to settle the island of Tobago,
sent Captain Tyrrel thither in a frigate, to learn the
particulars. That officer found above three hundred men
already landed, secured by two batteries and two ships of
war, and in daily expectation of a further re-enforcement
from the Marquis de Caylus, governour of Martinique;
who had published an ordonnance, authorising the sub∣jects
of the French King to settle the island of Tobago,
and promising to defend them from the attempts of all
their enemies. This assurance was in answer to a procla∣mation
issued by Mr. Grenville, governour of Barbadoes,
and stuck up in different parts of the island, command∣ing
all the inhabitants to remove in thirty days, on pain
of undergoing military execution. Captain Tyrrel, with
a spirit that became a commander in the British navy,
gave the French officers to understand, that his Mos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Christian Majesty had no right to settle the island, which
was declared neutral by treaties; and that, if they would
not desist, he should be obliged to employ force in driving
them from their new settlement. Night coming on,
and Mr. Tyrrel's ship falling to leeward, the French
captains seised that opportunity of sailing to Martinique;
and next day the English commander returned to Barba∣does,
having no power to commit hostilities. These
tidings, with a copy of the French governour's ordon∣nance,
were no sooner transmitted to the ministry than
they dispatched a courier to the English convoy at Paris,
with directions to make representations to the court of
<PB N="245" REF="253"/>
Versailles on this subject. The ministry of France,
knowing they were in no condition to support the con∣sequences
of an immediate rupture, and understanding
how much the merchants and people of Great-Britain
were alarmed and incensed at their attempts to possess
these islands, thought proper to disown the proceedings
of the Marquis de Caylus, and to grant the satisfaction
that was demanded, by sending him orders to discontinue
the settlement, and evacuate the island of Tobago. At
the same time, however, that the court of Versailles
made this sacrifice for the satisfaction of England, the
Marquis de Puysieux, the French minister, observed to
the English resident, that France was undoubtedly in
possession of that island towards the middle of the last
century. He ought in candour to have added, that al∣though
Louis XIV. made a conquest of this island from
the Hollanders, during his war with that republick, it was
restored to them by the treaty of Nimeguen; and since
that time France could not have the least shadow of a
claim to number it among her settlements. It was be∣fore
this answer could be obtained from the court of
Versailles that the motion, of which we have already
taken notice, was made in the House of Commons, re∣lating
to the subject of the neutral islands; a motion dis∣couraged
by the court, and defeated by the majority.</P>
<P>§ XXII. The peace of Aix-la-Chapelle was celebrated
by fire-works, illuminations, and rejoicings, in which
the English, French, and Dutch seemed to display a
spirit of emulation, in point of taste and magnificence;
and, in all probability, these three powers were sincerely
pleased at the cessation of the war. England enjoyed a
respite from intolerable supplies, exorbitant insurance,
and interrupted commerce: Holland was delivered from
the brink of a French invasion; and France had obtained
a breathing time for re-establishing her naval power, for
exerting that spirit of intrigue, by dint of which she hath
often embroiled her neighbours, and for executing plans
of insensible encroachment, which might prove more ad∣vantageous
<PB N="246" REF="254"/>
than the progress of open hostilities. In the
affair of Tobago the French King had manifested his
inclination to avoid immediate disputes with England;
and had exhibited another proof of the same disposition
in his behaviour to the Prince-Pretender, who had excited
such a dangerous rebellion in the island of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. Among those princes and powers who ex∣cepted
against different articles of the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle,
the Chevalier de St. George, foreseeing that
none of the plenipotentiaries would receive his protest,
employed his agents to fix it up in the publick places of
Aix-la Chapelle; a precaution of very little service to
his cause, which all the states of Christendom seemed
now to have abandoned. So little was the interest of
his family considered in this negociation, that the con∣tracting
powers agreed, without reserve, to a literal in∣sertion
of the fifth article of the quadruple alliance; by
which it was stipulated, that neither the Pretender nor
any of his descendants should be allowed to reside within
the territories belonging to any of the subscribing parties.
At the same time the plenipot entiaries of France promised
to those of Great-Britain, that Prince Charles-Edward
should be immediately obliged to quit the dominions of
his Most Christian Majesty. Notice of this agreement
was accordingly given by the court of Versailles to the
young adventurer; and as he had declared he would ne∣ver
return to Italy, Mons. de Courteille, the French
envoy to the cantons of Switzerland, was directed by his
sovereign to demand an asylum for Prince Edward in the
city of Fribourg. The regency having complied in this
particular with the earnest request of his Most Christian
Majesty, Mr. Burnaby, the British minister to the Hel∣vetick
Body, took the alarm, and presented the magistracy
of Fribourg with a remonstrance, couched in such terms
as gave offence to that regency, and drew upon him a
severe answer. In vain had the French King exerted his
influence in procuring this retreat for the young Preten∣der,
who, being pressed with repeated messages to with∣draw,
<PB N="247" REF="255"/>
persisted in refusing to quit the place, to which he
had been so cordially invited by his cousin the King of
France; and where he said that monarch had solemnly
promised, on the word of a king, that he would never
forsake him in his distress, nor abandon the interests of
his family. Louis was not a little perplexed at this ob∣stinacy
of Prince Edward, which was the more vexatious,
as that youth appeared to be the darling of the Parisians;
who not only admired him for his own accomplishments,
and pitied him for his sufferings, but also revered him, as a
young hero lineally descended from their renowned Henry
the Fourth. At length, the two English noblemen ar∣riving
at Paris, as hostages for the performance of the
treaty, and seeing him appear at all publick places of
diversion, complained of this circumstance, as an insult
to their sovereign, and an infringement of the treaty
so lately concluded. The French King, after some
hesitation between punctilio and convenience, resolved to
employ violence upon the person of this troublesome
stranger, since milder remonstrances had not been able
to influence his conduct: but this resolution was not
taken till the return of a courier whom he dispatched to
the Chevalier de St. George; who, being thus informed
of his son's deportment, wrote a letter to him, laying
strong injunctions upon him, to yield to the necessity
of the times, and acquiesce with a good grace in the
stipulations which his cousin of France had found it
necessary to subscribe, for the interest of his realm. Ed∣ward,
far from complying with this advice and injunction,
signified his resolution to remain in Paris; and even de∣clared,
that he would pistol any man who should presume
to lay violent hands on his person. In consequence
of this bold declaration, an extraordinary council was
held at Versailles, when it was determined to arrest him
without further delay, and the whole plan of this enterprise
was finally adjusted. That same evening, the Prince en∣tering
the narrow lane that leads to the Opera, the bar∣rier
was immediately shut, and the serjeant of the guard
<PB N="248" REF="256"/>
called “To arms,” on which Monsieur de Vaudreuil,
exempt of the French guards, advancing to Edward,
“Prince (said he) I arrest you in the King's name, by
virtue of this order.” At that instant the youth was
surrounded by four grenadiers, in order to prevent any
mischief he might have done with a case of pocket pistols
which he always carried about him; and a guard was
placed at all the avenues and doors of the Opera-house,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est any tumult should have ensued among the populace.
These precautions being taken, Vaudreuil, with an
escorte, conducted the prisoner through the garden of the
Palais-Royal to a house where the Duke de Biron waited
with a coach and six to convey him to the castle of Vin∣cennes,
whither he was immediately accompanied by a
detachment from the regiment of French Guards, under
the command of that nobleman. He had not remained
above three days in this confinement when he gave the
French ministry to understand, that he would conform
himself to the King's intentions; and was immediately en∣larged,
upon giving his word and honour that he would,
without delay, retire from the dominions of France. Ac∣cordingly,
he set out in four days from Fontainebleau, at∣tended
by three officers, who conducted him as far as Pont-Beauvosin
on the frontiers, where they took their leave of
him, and returned to Versailles. He proceeded for some
time in the road to Chamberri; but soon returned into the
French dominions, and, passing through Dauphiné, re∣paired
to Avignon, where he was received with extraordi∣nary
honours by the Pope's legate. In the mean time his
arrest excited great murmurings at Paris; the inhabitants
blaming, without scruple, their King's conduct in this
instance, as a scandalous breach of hospitality, as well as
a mean proof of condescension to the King of England;
and many severe pasquinades, relating to this transaction,
were fixed up in the most publick places of that metro∣polis.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. Although peace was now re-established
among the principal powers of the continent, yet another
<PB N="249" REF="257"/>
storm seemed ready to burst upon the northern parts of
Europe, in a fresh rupture between Russia and Sweden.
Whether the Czarina had actually obtained information
that the French faction meditated some revolution of
government at Stockholm, or she wanted a pretence for
annexing Finland to her empire; certain it is, she affected
to apprehend that the prince-successor of Sweden waited
only for the decease of the reigning king, who was very
old and infirm, to change the form of government, and
resume that absolute authority which some of the monarchs
his predecessors had enjoyed. She seemed to think that a
prince thus vested with arbitrary power, and guided by the
councils of France and Prussia, with which Sweden had
lately engaged in close alliance, might become a very
troublesome and dangerous neighbour to her in the
Baltick: she, therefore, recruited her armies, repaired
her fortifications, filled her magazines, ordered a strong
body of troops to advance towards the frontiers of Fin∣land,
and declared in plain terms to the court of Stock∣holm,
That if any step should be taken to alter the
government, which she had bound herself by treaty to
maintain, her troops should enter the territory of Sweden,
and she would act up to the spirit of her engagements.
The Swedish ministry, alarmed at these peremptory pro∣ceedings,
had recourse to their allies; and, in the mean
time, made repeated declarations to the court of Peters∣burgh,
That there was no design to make the least inno∣vation
in the nature of their established government: but
little or no regard being paid to these representations, they
began to put the kingdom in a posture of defence; and the
old King gave the Czarina to understand, That if, not∣withstanding
the satisfaction he had offered, her forces
should pass the frontiers of Finland, he would consider
their march as an hostile invasion, and employ the means
which God had put in his power for the defence of his
dominions.</P>
<P>§ XXV. This declaration, in all probability, did not
produce such effect as the interposition of his Prussian Ma∣jesty,
<PB N="250" REF="258"/>
the most enterprising prince of his time, at the head
of one hundred and forty thousand of the best troops that
Germany ever trained. Perhaps he was not sorry that the
Empress of Muscovy furnished him with a plausible pre∣tence
for maintaining such a formidable army, after the
peace of Europe had been ascertained by a formal treaty,
and all the surrounding states had diminished the number
of their forces. He now wrote a letter to his uncle the King
of Great-Britain, complaining of the insults and menaces
which had been offered by the Czarina to Sweden; declar∣ing,
that he was bound by a defensive alliance, to which
France had acceded, to defend the government at present
established in Sweden; and that he would not sit still, and
tamely see that kingdom attacked by any power whatsoever,
without acting up to his engagements: he therefore en∣treated
his Britannick Majesty to interpose his good offices,
in conjunction with France and him, to compromise the
disputes which threatened to embroil the northern parts of
Europe. By this time the Russian army had approached
the frontiers of Finland: the Swedes had assembled their
troops, replenished their magazines, and repaired their
marine; and the King of Denmark, jealous of the Czari∣na's
designs with regard to the duchy of Sleswick, which
was contested with him by the prince-successor of Russia,
kept his army and navy on the most respectable footing.
At this critical juncture the courts of London, Versailles,
and Berlin co-operated so effectually by remonstrances and
declarations at Petersburgh and Stockholm, that the Em∣press
of Russia thought proper to own herself satisfied,
and all those clouds of trouble were immediately dispers∣ed.
Yet, in all probability, her real aim was dis∣appointed;
and, however she might dissemble her sen∣timents,
she never heartily forgave the King of Prussia
for the share he had in this transaction. That mo∣narch,
without relaxing in his attention to the support of a
very formidable military power, exerted very extraordinary
endeavours in cultivating the civil interests of his country.
He reformed the laws of Brandenburgh, and rescued the
administration of justice from the frauds of chicanery. He
<PB N="251" REF="259"/>
encouraged the arts of agriculture and manufacture; and
even laid the foundation of naval commerce, by establishing
an East-India company in the port of Embden.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. Nor did the French ministry neglect any mea∣sure
that might contribute to repair the damage which the
kingdom had sustained in the course of the war. One half
of the army was disbanded: the severe imposition of the
tenth penny was suspended by the King's edict: a scheme
of oeconomy was proposed, with respect to the finances;
and the utmost diligence used in procuring materials, as
well as workmen, for ship-building, that the navy of France
might speedily retrieve its former importance. In the midst
of these truely patriotick schemes, the court of Versailles be∣trayed
a littleness of genius, and a spirit of tyranny, joined
to fanaticism, in quarrelling with their parliament about su∣perstitious
forms of religion. The sacraments had been
denied to a certain person on his death-bed, because he
refused to subscribe to the bull Unigenitus. The nephew
of the defunct preferred a complaint to the parliament,
whose province it was to take cognizance of the affair: a
deputation of that body attended the King with the report
of their resolutions; and his Majesty commanded them to
suspend all proceedings relating to a matter of such conse∣quence,
concerning which he would take an opportunity
of signifying his royal pleasure. This interposition was
the source of disputes between the crown and parliament,
which had like to have filled the whole kingdom with in∣testine
troubles.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. At Vienna the Empress-Queen was not more
sollicitous in promoting the trade and internal manu∣factures
of her dominions, by sumptuary regulations, ne∣cessary
restrictions on foreign superfluities, by opening her
ports in the Adriatick, and giving proper encouragement to
commerce, than she was careful and provident in reforming
the oeconomy of her finances, maintaining a respectable
body of forces, and guarding, by defensive alliances, against
the enterprises of his Prussian Majesty, on whose military
power she looked with jealousy and distrust. In Holland
<PB N="252" REF="260"/>
all the authority and influence of the Stadtholder were
scarcely sufficient to allay the ferments excited among the
people, by the provisional taxation which had succeeded
the abolition of the pachters, and was indeed very grievous
to the subject. As this was no more than a temporary ex∣pedient,
the Prince of Orange proposed a more equitable
plan, which was approved by the States, and established
with great difficulty. In Italy the system of politics seemed
to change its complexion. The King of Sardinia effected
a match between one of the Infantas of Spain and the
Prince of Piedmont; and whether irritated by the conduct
of the Austrians in the last war, or apprehensive of such a
powerful neighbour in the Milanese, he engaged with the
Kings of France and Spain in a defensive alliance, compre∣hending
the King of the Two Sicilies, the republick of
Genoa, and the Dukes of Modena and Parma. His most
Catholick Majesty, sincerely disposed to cultivate the arts of
peace, and encourage every measure that could contribute
to the advantage of his country, was no sooner released
from the embarrassments of war, then he began to execute
plans of internal oeconomy; to reduce unnecessary pensions,
discharge the debts contracted in the war, replenish his
arsenals, augment his navy, promote manufactures, and
encourage an active commerce by sea, the benefits of which
the kingdom of Spain had not known since the first disco∣very
and conquest of the West-Indies.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. The preparations for refitting and increasing
the navy of Spain were carried on with such extraordinary
vigour, that other nations believed an expedition was in∣tended
against the Corsairs of Algiers, who had for some
time grievously infested the trade and coast of the Mediter∣ranean.
The existence of this and other predatory repub∣licks,
which entirely subsist upon piracy and rapine, petty
states of barbarous ruffians, maintained, as it were, in the
midst of powerful nations, which they insult with impunity,
and of which they even exact an annual contribution, is a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lagrant reproach upon Christendom; a reproach the great∣er,
as it is founded upon a low, selfish, illiberal maxim of
<PB N="253" REF="261"/>
policy. All the powers that border on the Mediterranean,
except France and Tuscany, are at perpetual war with the
Moors of Barbary, and, for that reason, obliged to employ
foreign ships for the transportation of their merchandise.
This employment naturally devolves to those nations whose
vessels are in no danger from the depredations of the bar∣barians;
namely, the subjects of the Maritime Powers,
who, for this puny advantage, not only tolerate the pirati∣cal
states of Barbary, but even supply them with arms and
ammunition, sollicit their passes, and purchase their forbear∣ance
with annual presents, which are, in effect, equivalent
to a tribute: whereas, by one vigorous exertion of their
power, they might destroy all their ships, lay their towns in
ashes, and totally extirpate those pernicious broods of de∣sperate
banditti. Even all the condescension of those who
disgrace themselves with the title of allies to these miscre∣ants
is not always sufficient to restrain them from acts of
cruelty and rapine. At this very period four cruisers from
Algiers made a capture of an English packet-boat, in her
voyage from Lisbon, and conveyed her to their city, where
she was plundered of money and effects to the amount of
one hundred thousand pounds, and afterwards dismissed.
In consequence of this outrage, Commodore Keppel was
sent with seven ships of war to demand satisfaction, as
well as to compromise certain differences which had arisen
on account of arrears claimed of the English by the Dey of
Algiers. The Mussulman frankly owned, that the money
having been divided among the captors could not possibly
be refunded. The Commodore returned to Gibraltar;
and, in the sequel, an Algerine ambassador arrived in Lon∣don,
with some presents of wild beasts for his Britannick
Majesty. This transaction was succeeded by another in∣jurious
affront, offered by the governor or Alcayde of Te∣tuan
to Mr. Latton, an English ambassador, sent thither
to redeem the British subjects, who had been many years
enslaved in the dominions of the King of Morocco. A
revolution having lately happened in this empire, Muley
Abdallah, the reigning russian, insisted upon the ambassa∣dor's
<PB N="254" REF="262"/>
paying a pretended balance for the ransom of the
captives, as well as depositing a considerable sum, which
had already been paid to a deceased bashaw; alledging,
that as he (the Emperor) received no part of it, the pay∣ment
was illegal. Mr. Latton refusing to comply with
this arbitrary demand, his house was surrounded by a de∣tachment
of soldiers, who violently dragged his secretary
from his presence, and threw him into a dismal subterranean
dungeon, where he continued twenty days. The English
slaves, to the number of twenty-seven, were condemned to
the same fate: the ambassador himself was degraded from
his character, deprived of his allowance, and sequestered
from all communication. All the letters directed to him were
intercepted, and interpreted to the Alcayde: two negro
porters were entrusted with the keys of all his apartments,
and a couple of soldiers posted at his chamber-door: nay,
this Moorish governor threatened to load him with irons,
and violently seised part of the presents designed by his
Britannick Majesty for the Emperor. At length, finding
that neither Mr. Latton nor the governor of Gibraltar, to
whom he had written, would deposit the money, without
fresh instructions from the Court of London, the barbarian
thought proper to relax in his severity: the prisoners were
enlarged, the restrictions removed from the person of the
ambassador, and, after all these indignities offered to the
honour of the British nation, the balance was paid, and
the affair quietly adjusted.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. Britain, in the mean while, was altogether
barren of events which might deserve a place in a general
history. Commerce and manufacture flourished again, to
such a degree of increase as had never been known in the
island: but this advantage was attended with an irresistible
tide of luxury and excess, which flowed through all degrees
of the people, breaking down all the mounds of civil po∣lity,
and opening a way for license and immorality. The
highways were insested with rap<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e and assassination; the
cities teemed with the brutal votaries of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ewdness, intemper∣ance,
and prosligacy. The whole land was overspread
<PB N="255" REF="263"/>
with a succession of tumult, riot, and insurrection, excited
in different parts of the kingdom by the erection of new
turnpikes, which the legislature judged necessary for the
convenience of inland carriage. In order to quell these
disturbance, recourse was had to the military power: se∣veral
individuals were slain, and some were executed as
examples.</P>
<P>§ XXX. In the month of November the session of par∣liament
was opened with a speech from the throne, in
which his Majesty expressed a particular pleasure in meeting
them at a time when the perfect re-establishment of a
general peace had restored to his people the blessings of quiet
and tranquility. He said, the good effects of these already
appeared in the flourishing condition of national commerce,
and in the rise of publick credit, which were the foundations
of strength and prosperity to these kingdoms. He declared,
That, during the summer, he had used every opportunity of
cementing and securing the peace: That it was his firm
resolution to do every thing in his power for the preservation
of it, and religiously adhere to the engagements into which
he had entered. Finally, he took notice of the good dispo∣sition
he had found in the other contracting parties to the
treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle to cherish the public tranquillity
of Europe: and he earnestly recommended to the two
Houses the maintenance of a strong naval power, as the
bulwark of national security.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. When the motion was made for an address of
thanks in the House of Commons, the first paragraph of his
Majesty's speech furnished the opposition with a handle to
declaim against the late treaty. Sir John Hynde Cotton
observed, That the peace could not be properly stiled com∣plete,
as nothing had been stipulated with respect to the
article of “no search;” alluding to the interruption our
commerce had sustained from the Spaniards in the West-Indies:
a stipulation, without which both Houses of
parliament had formerly voted that there should be no peace
with that kingdom.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1749.</NOTE> In the present conjuncture of affairs,
such an objection favoured rather of party than of pa∣triotism;
<PB N="256" REF="264"/>
and indeed Sir John declared,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1749.</NOTE> that the remarks
he made upon the occasion were rather in discharge of the
duty he owed to his country, than in hope of seeing his
sentiments espoused by the majority. Some sharp alterca∣tion
was used in the debate which arose on this subject;
and many severe invectives were levelled at those who ne∣gociated,
as well as at those who approved and confirmed
the treaty. But Mr. Pelham, who sustained the whole
weight of the debate on the side of administration, answered
every objection with equal candour and ability; and if he
failed in proving that the terms of peace were as favourable
as could be expected, considering the unfortunate events of
the war, and the situation of the contending powers; he at
least demonstrated, that it would be the interest of the king∣dom
to acquiesce for the present in the treaty which had
been concluded, and endeavour to remedy its imperfections
by subsequent conventions, amicably opened among those
powers between whom any cause of dispute remained.
With respect to the vote of both houses, mentioned by
Sir John Hynde Cotton, he declared that he had never
approved of that step, when it was first taken; or if he
had, times and circumstances, which could not be foreseen,
would have justified his deviating from it in the re-estab∣lishment
of peace. He reminded them, that a parliament
of Great-Britain had once voted “no peace while any
part of the West-Indies should remain in possession of the
Spanish King;” yet a train of incidents, which they could
not possibly foresee, afterwards rendered it expedient to
adopt a peace, without insisting upon the accomplishment
of that condition. In a word, he must own, that, in the
majority of debates excited in the course of this session, the
ministry derived their triumphs from the force of reason,
as well as from the weight of influence. We shall always,
however, except the efforts that were made for reducing
the number of land forces to fifteen thousand, and main∣taining
a greater number of seamen than the ministry pro∣posed.
On these constitutional points the Earl of Egmont,
and the other chiefs of the opposition, expatiated with all
<PB N="257" REF="265"/>
the energy of eloquence;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. I. 1749.</NOTE> which, however, was frustrated
by the power of superior number. Ten thousand seamen
were voted for the service of the ensuing year, notwith∣standing
his Majesty's injunction to maintain a considerable
navy; and the number of land-forces was continued at
eighteen thousand eight hundred and fifty-seven. The
sums granted for making good his Majesty's engagements
with the Electors of Bavaria and Mentz, and the Duke of
Brunswick Wolfenbuttel, amounted to fifty three thousand
two hundred and twenty-five pounds sterling. The ser∣vices
done by the colonies in North-America, during the
war, were gratified with the sum of one hundred twenty-two
thousand two hundred forty-six pounds. The expense
incurred by the new colony of Nova-Scotia exceeded
seventy-six thousand pounds. A small sum was voted for
the improvement of Georgia; and ten thousand pounds
were granted towards the support of the British forts and
settlements on the coast of Africa. The sum total granted
in this session arose to four millions one hundred forty one
thousand six hundred sixty-one pounds, nine shillings, and
eleven pence half-penny, to be raised by the land tax, at
three shillings in the pound; the malt, and other duties, the
surplus of divers impositions remaining in the Bank and
Exchequer: one million by annuities, at three per cent.
charged on the sinking fund, until redeemed by parliament;
and nine hundred thousand pounds out of the excess or
overplus of monies denominated the sinking fund.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. But the capital measure which distinguished
this session of parliament was the reduction of the interest
on the publick funds; a scheme which was planned and
executed by the minister, without any national disturbance
or disquiet, to the astonishment of all Europe; the different
nations of which could not comprehend how it would be
possible for the government, at the close of a long expensive
war, which had so considerably drained the country, and
augmented the enormous burthen of national debt, to find
money for paying off such of the publick creditors as might
choose to receive their principal, rather than submit to a
<PB N="258" REF="266"/>
reduction of the interest. It was not very much for the
honour of the opposition, that some of its leading members
endeavoured to impede this great machine of civil oeco∣nomy,
by taking opportunities of affirming in parliament,
in opposition to his Majesty's speech, that the nation, far
from being in a flourishing condition, was almost entirely
exhausted; that commerce drooped and declined; that
publick credit stood tottering on the brink of ruin; and that
all the treaties lately concluded among the different powers
of Europe were, in effect, disadvantageous and prejudicial
to the interests of Great-Britain. In answer to these asser∣tions,
Mr. Pelham undertook to prove, from the register
of exports and imports, that the commerce of the kingdom
was more extensive at this than at any former period; and
that the publick credit was strong enough to admit of an
experiment, which he would not presume to hazard, ex∣cept
upon a moral certainty of its being firmly rooted, be∣yond
the power of accident and faction to shake or over∣turn.
He declared, that his design of reducing the interest
upon the funds was the result of the love he bore his coun∣try,
and an opinion that it was the duty of the servants of
the crown to ease the burthens of the people. He said, he
had conferred on this subject with persons of the most ap∣proved
knowledge, and undoubted experience; and chose
to promulgate the method proposed for alleviating the load
of the national debt, that the public, in knowing the parti∣culars
of the scheme, might have time to consider them at
leisure, and start such objections as should occur to their
reflexion, before it might be too late to adopt amendments.
He observed, that nothing could more clearly demonstrate
the vigour of public credit, and the augmentation of national
commerce, than the price of stock, which had within three
years risen to a very considerable increase; and the duties
on imports, which in nine months had added one million to
the sinking fund, notwithstanding a very extraordinary
sum which had been paid as bounties for exported corn.
He expressed great tenderness and regard for the interests of
those who had advanced their money for the service of the
<PB N="259" REF="267"/>
government; declaring, that his aim was to contrive a fair,
honest, and equitable method for lessening the national
incumbrances, by lowering the interest, conformable to
parliamentary faith, and agreeable to the rules of eternal
justice. His plan was accordingly communicated, can∣vassed,
and approved in the House of Commons, and an
act passed for reducing the interest of the funds which con∣stitute
the national debt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The resolutions of the Commons on this head were printed by authority in the London-Gazette, signifying, That those who were, or should be, pro∣prietors of any part of the publick debt, redeemable by law, incurred before Michaelmas, in the year one thousand seven hundred and forty nine, carrying an interest of four per centum per annum, who should, on or before the twen∣ty-eighth day of February in that year, subscribe their names, signifying their consent to accept of an interest of three pounds per centum, to com∣mence from the twenty-fifth day of December, in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-seven, subject to the same provisions, notices, and clauses of redemption to which their respective sums at four per centum were then liable should, in lieu of their present interest, be entitled to four per centum till the twenty-fifth day of December in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty; and after that day, to three pounds ten shillings per centum per annum, till the twenty-fifth Day of December one thousand seven hundred and fifty-seven; and no part of that debt, except what was due to the East-India company, should be redeemable to this period: That if any part of the na∣tional debt, incurred before last Michaelmas, redeemable by law, and carry∣ing an interest of four per centum, should remain unsubscribed on or before the thirtieth day of May, the government should pay off the principal. For this purpose his Majesty was enabled to borrow of any person or persons, bodies politic or corporate, any sum or sums of money not exceeding that part of the national debt which might remain unsubscribed, to be charged on the sinking fund, upon any terms not exceeding the rate of interest in the foregoing proposal.</P>
<P>All the duties appropriated to the payment of the interest were still con∣tinued, and the surplus of these incorporated with the sinking fund for the discharge of the principal. Books were opened for the subscription at the Exchequer, the Bank of England, and the South-Sea house; and copies of these resolutions transmitted to the directors of all the monied corporations.</P></NOTE>. In pursuance of this act, for
the reduction of the interest, the greater part of the credi∣tors
complied with the terms proposed, and subscribed their
respective annuities before the end of February; but the
three great companies at first kept aloof, and refused to
subscribe any part of their capital.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> About the middle of March the Commons
ordered the proper officers to lay before them an account of
<PB N="260" REF="268"/>
the sums which had been subscribed, and these were taken
into consideration by a committee of the whole House.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1750.</NOTE> It
was then that Mr. Pelham, as chancellor of the Exche∣quer,
observed, That, besides the debts due to the three
great companies in their corporate capacity, all the rest,
carrying four per centum interest, had been subscribed, ex∣cept
about eight or nine millions, the proprietors of which
had forfeited the favour designed them by parliament: but
as many of these had been mis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by evil counsellors, who
perhaps were more intent on distressing the government,
than sollicitous to serve their friends; and as many were
foreigners, residing beyond sea, who had not time to take
proper advice, and give the necessary instructions; and as
these could not possibly be distinguished from such as re∣fused
to subscribe from mere obstinacy or disaffection, it
might be thought cruel to take the most rigorous advantage
of the forfeiture they had incurred. With respect to the
proprietors of the stock or capital belonging to the three
great companies, he asserted, that many of them would
willingly have subscribed their properties within the time
limited, but were necessarily excluded by the majority on
the ballot; and as it was equally impossible to know those
who were against the question on the ballot, he thought
that some tenderness was due even to the proprietors of
those three companies: his opinion, therefore, was, that
they and the uncomplying annuitants should be indulged
with further time to complete their subscription; but, in
order to preserve the authority of parliament, and the re∣spect
due to that august assembly, they ought not to be
gratified with such advantageous terms as were allowed to
the annuitants who at first chearfully complied with the
proposals offered by the legislature. For these reasons he
proposed, That although the term of subscribing should
be protracted till the thirtieth day of May, the encourage∣ment
of three pounds ten shillings per centum per annum
should not be continued to the second subscribers longer
than till the fifth day of December, in the year one thou∣sand
seven hundred and fifty-five. The proposal being
<PB N="261" REF="269"/>
approved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. I. 1750.</NOTE> a bill was framed for this purpose, as well as for
redeeming such annuities as should not be subscribed,
which passed through both Houses, and was enacted into a
law, after having received an additional clause, empowering
the East-India Company, in case they should subscribe all
their stock bearing an interest of four per centum, to bor∣row,
with the consent of the Treasury, any sums not ex∣ceeding
four millions two hundred thousand pounds, after
the several rates of interest before proposed to be paid by the
publick, and one million more at three per centum per
annum. They were also vested with a power to raise mo∣ney
by bonds, as formerly; yet so as the whole, including
the annuities, should not exceed what they were by former
acts empowered to borrow. The objections to the execu∣tion
of this project, which by many were deemed infur∣mountable,
entirely vanished before the fortitude, perse∣verance,
and caution of the minister; who had secured,
among the moneyed men of the nation, the promise of
such sums as would have been sufficient to pay off the
capital belonging to those creditors who might refuse to
accept the interest thus reduced. The second subscription
had the desired effect. The three great companies acquiesc∣ed,
and their example was followed by the other scrupulous
annuitants: the national burthen was comfortably light∣ened,
and the sinking fund considerably increased, without
producing the least perplexity or disturbance in the com∣monwealth;
a circumstance that could not fail to excite
the admiration and envy of all Christendom.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. The mutiny-bill for the ensuing year was
mitigated with an essential alteration, relating to the oath
of secresy imposed upon the members of every court∣martial,
who were now released from this reserve if re∣quired
to give evidence, by due course of law, in any court
of judicature; and whereas, by the former mutiny-bill, a
general was empowered to order the revisal of any sentence
by a court-martial as often as he pleased, and, on that
pretence, to keep in confinement a man who had been
acquitted upon a fair trial, it was now enacted, That no
<PB N="262" REF="270"/>
sentence pronounced by any court-martial, and signed by
the president, should be more than once liable to revisal.
Colonel George Townshend, son of Lord Viscount
Townshend, who had equally distinguished himself by his
civil and military accomplishments, proposed another
clause, for preventing any non-commissioned officer's being
broke, or reduced into the ranks; or any soldier's being
punished, but by the sentence of a court-martial. He gave
the House to understand, that certain persons attended at
the door, who from the station of non-commissioned officers
had been broke, and reduced into the ranks, without trial,
or any cause assigned; and he expatiated not only upon
the iniquity of such proceedings, but also upon the danger
of leaving such arbitrary power in the hands of any indi∣vidual
officer. A warm debate was the consequence of
this motion, which, however, was over-ruled by the
majority.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. Among other regulations made in the course
of this session for the encouragement of the British manu∣factures,
a large duty was laid upon Irish sail-cloth, which,
being sold at an under price, was found to interfere with
the same species of commodity fabricated in the island of
Great-Britain; and, for the further benefit of this last, the
bounty upon the exportation of it, which had been de∣ducted
from a defective fund, was now made payable out
of the Customs. This measure, however, was not of such
importance to the nation as the act which they passed for
encouraging the importation of pig and bar iron from the
British colonies in North-America. Every well-wisher to
his country reflected with concern on the nature of the
British trade with Sweden, from which kingdom the sub∣jects
of his Britannick Majesty imported more iron and
steel than all the other countries in Europe. For this ar∣ticle
they paid a very great balance in ready money, which
the Swedes again expended in purchasing from the French,
and other mercantile powers, those necessaries and super∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luities
with which they might have been as cheaply fur∣nished
by Great Britain. In the mean time, the English
<PB N="263" REF="271"/>
colonies in America were restricted by severe duties from
making advantage of their own produce, in exchanging
their iron for such commodities as they were under the
necessity of procuring from their mother-country. Such
restriction was not only a cruel grievance upon our own
settlements, but also attended with manifest prejudice to
the interest of Great-Britain, annually drained of great
sums, in favour of an ungrateful nation, from which no
part of them returned; whereas the iron imported from
America must of necessity come in exchange for our own
manufactures. The Commons having appointed a day
for taking this affair into consideration, carefully examined
into the state of the British commerce carried on with
Sweden, as well as into the accounts of iron imported from
the plantations in America; and a committee of the whole
House having resolved, that the duties on American pig
and bar iron should be removed, a bill<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The most remarkable circumstance attending the progress of this bill which made its way through both Houses, and obtained the royal assent, was the number of contradictory petitions in favour and in prejudice of it, while it remained under consideration. The tanners of leather in and about the town of Sheffield, in Yorkshire, represented, That if the bill should pass, the English iron would be undersold; consequently a great number of furnaces and forge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would be discontinued: in that cas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the woods used for fuel would stand uncut, and the tanners be deprived of oak-bark sufficient for the continuance and support of their occupation. They nevertheless owned, that should the duty be removed from pig iron only, no such consequence could be apprehended; because, should the number of furnaces be lessened, that of forges would be increased. This was likewise the plea urged in divers remonstrances by masters of iron∣works, gentlemen, and free holders, who had tracts of wood-land in their possession. The owners, proprietors, and farmers of furnaces and iron-for∣ges, belonging to Sheffield and its neighbourhood, enlarged upon the great expense they had incurred in erecting and supporting iron-works, by means of which great numbers of his Majesty's subjects were comfortably sup∣ported. They expressed their apprehension, that should the bill pass into a law, it could not in any degree lessen the consumption of Swedish iron, which was used for purposes which neither the American nor British iron would answer: but that the proposed encouragement, considering the plenty and cheapness of wood in America, would enable the colonies to undersell the British iron, a branch of traffick which would be totally de∣stroyed, to the ruin of many thousand labourers, who would be compelled to seek their livelihood in foreign countries. They likewise suggested, that if all the iron manufacturers of Great Britain should be obliged to depend upon a supply of iron from the plantations, which must ever be rendered precarious by the hazard of the seas and the enemy, the manufactures would probably decay for want of materials, and many thousand families be reduced to want and misery. On the other hand, the ironmongers and smiths belonging to the flourishing town of Birmingham, in Warwick∣shire, presented a petition, declaring, That the bill would be of great be∣nefit to the trade of the nation, as it would enable the colonists to make larger returns of their own produce, and encourage them to take a greater quantity of the British manufactures. They affirmed, that all the iron works in the island of Great-Britain did not supply half that quantity of that metal sufficient to carry on the manufacture; that if this deficiency could be supplied from the colonies in America, the importation would cease, and considerable sums of money be saved to the nation. They ob∣served, that the importation of iron from America could no more affect the iron-works and freeholders of the kingdom than the like quantity im∣ported from any other country; but they prayed that the people of Ame∣rica might be restrained from erecting slitting or rolling mills, or forges for plating iron, as they would interfere with the manufactures of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>Many remonstrances to the same effect were presented from different parts of the kingdom; and it appeared, upon the most exact enquiry, that the encouragement of American iron would prove extremely beneficial to the kingdom, as it had been found, upon trial, applicable to all the uses of Swedish iron, and as good in every respect as the produce of that country.</P></NOTE> was brought in
<PB N="264" REF="272"/>
for that purpose, containing a clause, however, to prevent
his Majesty's subjects from making steel, and establishing
mills for slitting and rolling iron within the British colo∣nies
of America; this precaution being taken, that the co∣lonists
might not interfere with the manufactures of their
mother-country.</P>
<P>§ XXXVI. The next commercial improvement, of
which we shall take notice, was the bill for the encourage∣ment
of the British white-herring and cod fisheries. This
was likewise the result of mature deliberation, importing,
That a bounty of thirty shillings per ton should be granted,
and paid out of the customs, to all new vessels from
twenty to fourscore tons burthen, which should be built
for that purpose, and actually employed in the fishery:
That a society should be incorporated, under the name of
the Free British Fishery, by a charter, not exclusive, with
power to raise a capital not exceeding five hundred thou∣sand
pounds; and that three pounds ten shillings per
centum per annum should be granted and paid out of the
<PB N="265" REF="273"/>
Customs to the proprietors for fourteen years, for so much
of the capital as should be actually employed in the said
fisheries. Corresponding chambers were proposed to be
erected in remote parts of North-Britain, for taking in sub∣scriptions,
and prosecuting the trade, under the directions
of the company at London; and the nation in general
seemed eager to dispute this branch of commerce with the
subjects of Holland, whom they considered as ungrateful
interlopers. In the House of Peers, however, the bill<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
met with a formidable opposition from the Earl of Win∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chelsea
and Lord Sandys, who justly observed, That it
was a crude, indigested scheme, which, in the execution,
would never answer the expectations of the people: That
in contending with the Dutch, who are the patterns of
unwearied industry, and the most rigid oeconomy, nothing
could be more absurd than a joint-stock company, which
is always clogged with extraordinary expense; and the
resolution of fitting out vessels at the port of London,
where all sorts of materials, labour, and seamen are so much
dearer than in any other part of the united kingdom, ex∣clusive
of the great distance and dangerous voyage between
the metropolis and the Sound of Brassa, in She4land, the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>endezvous at which all the herring-busses were to assemble
in the beginning of the fishing season. They likewise
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook notice of the heavy duty on salt, used in curing the
fish for sale, and the beef for provision to the mariners; a
circumstance of itself sufficient to discourage adventurers
from embarking in a commerce which, at best, yields but
very slender profits to the trader in particular, how in∣portant
soever it might prove to the community in general.
These objections were answered by the Duke of Argyle
and the Earl of Granville, who seemed to think that this
branch of trade could not be fairly set on foot, without such
a considerable sum of money as no single individual would
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are to advance; that a joint-stock company would be able
to prosecute the fishery at a smaller expense than that which
particular traders must necessarily incur; that the present
spirit of the nation, which was eagerly bent upon trying
<PB N="266" REF="274"/>
the experiment, ought not to be baulked by delay, lest it
should evaporate; and that though the plan was not un∣exceptionable,
the defects of it might in the sequel be re∣medied
by the legislature. In a word, the bill was adopted
by the majority, with a small amendment in the title,
which produced some disquiets in the Lower-House: but
this dispute was compromised, and it was enacted into a
law towards the close of the session. Nothing could be
more agreeable to the publick than the sanction of the
legislature to this favourite plan, which was ardently pro∣moted,
and patronised by men of the greatest eminence for
wealth and popularity. The company chose for their
governour the Prince of Wales, who received this proof
of their attachment and respect with particular marks of
satisfaction: the president and vice-president were both
aldermen of London; and the council was composed of
thirty gentlemen, the majority of whom were members of
parliament. Great pains were taken, and some artifice
was used, to learn the Dutch method of curing the fish
People crowded with their subscriptions; a number of
hands were employed in building and equipping the busse
of vessels used in the fishery; and the most favourable con∣sequences
were expected from the general vigour and
alacrity which animated these preparations. But th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
success did not gratify the sanguine hopes of the projector
and adventurers. The objections made in the House o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Lords soon appeared to have been well founded: thes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
co-operating with mismanagement in the directors, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
spirit of the company began to flag, the natural conse∣quences
of commercial disappointment, and now the
British fishery seems to languish under the neglect of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
legislature.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. Touching the trade to the coast of Afric<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
petitions were renewed by the company and its creditor
the merchants of Bristol, Liverpool, and Lancaster; an
a remonstrance was presented by the planters and merchant
interested in the British sugar settlements in America: be
the Commons adhered to their former resolutions of layin
<PB N="267" REF="275"/>
open the trade, maintaining the forts at the publick ex∣pense,
and regulating the commerce by a committee of
merchants, representing the chief trading towns in the
kingdom, to be superintended by the board of trade and
plantations. The bill was accordingly framed and pre∣sented,
and having proceeded through both Houses with∣out
opposition, obtained the royal assent. Over and above
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hese wise, salutary, and patriotick measures for the im∣provement
of commerce, they encouraged the importation
of raw silk by an act, reducing the duties formerly pay∣able
on that which was the growth of China to the same
that is raised on the raw silk from Italy, and allowing the
same drawback upon the exportation of the one which had
been usually granted on the other. A second bill was
brought in for the encouragement of the growth and culture
of silk in Carolina and Georgia, where it had been lately
produced with extraordinary success, by freeing from all
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uties that which should be imported from his Majesty's
dominions in America: and a third was framed, permit∣ing
raw silk of the growth or produce of Persia, purchased
a Russia, to be imported into Great-Britain, from any
port or place belonging to the empire of Russia. Divers
efforts were made, by different members in the opposition,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rectify certain abuses in the army and administration:
some bills were brought in, and several petitions were
left on the table; but all of them proved abortive, from
the power and influence of the minister, who seemed re∣solved
that no benefit should flow upon the nation through
any channel but his own. Nevertheless, it must be
acknowledged, for the honour of his memory, that there
is no session on record so productive as this was of mea∣sures
advantageous to the community.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. The people, however, were not entirely
satisfied with the conduct of the administration, if we
may judge from the ferment and commotions raised during
the progress of an election for a citizen to represent the
city of Westminster in parliament. The seat which had
been filled by Lord Trentham, eldest son of Earl Gower,
<PB N="268" REF="276"/>
having become vacant, in consequence of that nobleman's
accepting a place at the board of Admiralty, he again de∣clared
himself a candidate, and met with a violent oppo∣sition.
Those who stiled themselves the independent
electors of Westminster, being now incensed to an un∣common
degree of turbulence by the interposition of mini∣sterial
influence, determined to use their utmost endeavour;
to baffle the designs of the court, and at the same time
take vengeance on the family of Earl Gower, who had
entirely abandoned the opposition, of which he was
formerly one of the most respectable leaders. With this
view they held consuitations, agreed to resolutions, and
set up a private gentleman, named Sir George Vandeput,
as the competitor of Lord Trentham, declaring that they
would support his pretensions at their own expense, being
the more encouraged to this enterprise by the countenance
and assistance of the Prince of Wales and his adherents.
They accordingly opened houses of entertainment for their
partisans, sollicited votes, circulated remonstrances, and
propagated abuse: in a word, they canvassed, with sur∣prising
spirit and perseverance, against the whole interest
of St. James's. Mobs were hired and processions made
on both sides, and the city of Westminster was filled with
tumult and uproar. The mutual animosity of the parties
seemed every day to increase during the election, and a
great number of unqualified votes were presented on both
sides: all the powers of insinuation, obloquy, and ridi∣cule
were employed to vilify and depreciate both candi∣dates.
At length the poll being closed, a majority of
votes appeared in behalf of Lord Trentham: but a scrutiny
being demanded by the other side, the returning office
complied with their request. The Speaker of the Lower
House had issued his warrant for a new writ of election
about the middle of November; and towards the end of
February Mr. Fox, secretary at war, standing up, and
observing that no return had yet been made, though
proper to move, That the clerk of the crown, the mes∣senger
extraordinary attending the great seal, the under
<PB N="269" REF="277"/>
sheriff of Middlesex, and the high-bailiff of Westminster,
should attend next morning, and give an account of their
issuing, delivering, and executing the writ of election.
These being examined, and the high-bailiff declaring that
he would proceed with all possible dispatch in the scrutiny,
which had been demanded and was begun, Mr. Speaker
explained to him some particulars of his duty; in the
discharge of which, he was given to understand he might
depend upon the protection of the House, should he meet
with any obstruction which he could not otherwise sur∣mount.
By the violence and caprice with which a great
number of votes were contested on both sides, the scrutiny
was protracted a long time, and the return attended with
some extraordinary consequences, which shall be particular∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed
among the transactions of the next year. In the mean
time, the present session of parliament was closed on the
twelfth day of April, with a speech from the throne, com∣mending
the Commons for having seised the very first
opportunity of reducing the interest of the national debt,
without the least infringement upon the faith of parliament;
and congratulating them on the flourishing state of the
publick credit, which could not fail to add strength and
reputation to the government, both at home and abroad.
Immediately after the rising of the parliament his Majesty
appointed a regency to govern the kingdom in his absence,
and embarked for the continent, in order to visit his
German dominions.</P>
<P>§ XXXIX. The month of January and the beginning
of February were distinguished, the first by a very remark∣able
Aurora Borealis, appearing at night to the north-east,
of a deep and dusky red colour, like the reflexion of
some great fire, for which it was by many people mistaken;
and the corruscations, unlike those that are generally
observed, did not meet in the zenith, but in a point some
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egrees to the southward. February was ushered in by
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>errible peals of thunder, flashes of lightning, and such a
tempest of wind, hail, and rain, as overwhelmed with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear and consternation the inhabitants of Bristol, where
<PB N="270" REF="278"/>
it chiefly raged. On the eighth day of the same month,
between twelve and one in the afternoon, the people of
London were still more dreadfully alarmed by the shock
of an earthquake, which shook all the houses with such
violence, that the furniture rocked on the floors, the
pewter and porcelaine rattled on the shelves, the chamber
bells rang, and the whole of this commotion was attended
with a clap or noise resembling that produced by the fall
of some heavy piece of furniture. The shock extended
through the cities of London and Westminster, and was
felt on both sides of the river Thames, from Greenwich
to the Westward of London; but not perceptible at any
considerable distance. On the very same day of the next
month, between five and six o'clock in the morning, the
inhabitants of the metropolis were again affrighted by a
second shock, more violent than the first, and abundantly
more alarming, as it waked the greater part of the people
from their repose. It was preceded by a succession of
thick low flashes of lightning, and a rumbling noise, like
that of a heavy carriage rolling over a hollow pavement.
The shock itself consisted of repeated vibrations, which
lasted some seconds, and violently shook every house from
top to bottom. Again the chairs rocked, the shelves
clattered, the small bells rang, and in some places public
clocks were heard to strike. Many persons, roused by this
terrible visitation, started naked from their beds, and ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
to their doors and windows in distraction: yet no life was
lost, and no house overthrown by this concussion, though
it was so dreadful as to threaten an immediate dissolution
of the globe. The circumstance, however, did not fai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to make a deep impression upon ignorant, weak, and
superstitious minds, which were the more affected by the
consideration that the two shocks were periodical; tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the second, which happened exactly one month after th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
first, had been the more violent; and that the next, in∣creasing
in proportion, might be attended with the mos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
dismal consequences. This general notion was confirmed
and indeed propagated, among all ranks of people by th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="271" REF="279"/>
admonitions of a fanatick soldier, who publickly preached
up repentance, and boldly prophesied that the next shock
would happen on the same of April, and totally destroy
the cities of London and Westminster. Considering the
infectious nature of fear and superstition, and the emphatic
manner in which the imagination had been prepared and
prepossed, it is no wonder that the prediction of this
illiterate enthusiast should have contributed in a great
measure to augment the general terror. The churches
were crowded with penitent sinners: the sons of riot and
profligacy were overawed into sobriety and decorum.
The streets no longer resounded with execrations, or the
noise of brutal licentiousness; and the hand of charity
was liberally opened. Those whom fortune had enabled
to retire from the devoted city fled to the country with
hurry and precipitation, insomuch that the highways were
encumbered with horses and carriages. Many who had,
in the beginning, combated these groundless fears with
the weapons of reason and ridicule, began insensibly to
imbibe the contagion, and felt their hearts fail, in pro∣portion
as the hour of probation approached: even science
and philosophy were not proof against the unaccountable
effects of this communication. In after-ages it will
hardly be believed, that on the evening of the eighth day
of April the open fields that skirt the metropolis were
filled with an incredible number of people, assembled in
chairs, in chaises, and coaches, as well as on foot, who
waited in the most fearful suspense until morning and
the return of day disproved the truth of the dreaded pro∣phesy.
Then their fears vanished: they returned to
their respective habitations in a transport of joy; and
were soon reconciled to their abandoned vices, which they
seemed to resume with redoubled affection, and once
more bade defiance to the vengeance of heaven.</P>
<P>§ XL. By this time all the jails in England were filled
with the refuse of the army and navy, which having been
dismissed at the peace, and either averse to labour, or
excluded from employment, had naturally preyed upon
<PB N="272" REF="280"/>
the commonwealth. Great numbers of those wretches
who, by proper regulations, might have been rendered
serviceable to the community, were executed as examples;
and the rest perished miserably, amidst the stench and
horrors of noisome dungeons. Even the prison of New∣gate
was rendered so infectious by the uncommon crowds
of confined felons, stewed together in close apartments,
that the very air they breathed acquired a pestilential degree
of putrefaction. It was this putrified air, which, adher∣ing
to the clothes of the malefactors brought to trial at
the bar of the Old-Bailey in May, produced among the
audience a pestilential fever, which infected and proved
fatal to the lord-mayor of London, to one alderman, two
of the judges, divers lawyers who attended the session, the
greatest part of the jury, and a considerable number of the
spectators. In order to prevent such disasters for the
future, the jails were cleansed, and accommodated with
ventilators, which exhaust the foul and supply a circu∣lation
of fresh air; and other humane precautions were
taken for the benefit of the prisoners.</P>
<P>§ XLI. The affairs of the continent underwent no re∣markable
alteration. An ambassador extraordinary being
sent to Petersburgh from the court of London, declared
to the Czarina's minister, that in case of a rupture between
Russia and Sweden, occasioned by the hostilities com∣mitted
by the former power, his Britannick Majesty would
consider Russia as the aggressor, and the Czarina could
not expect that he would supply her with the succour<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
which he was engaged by treaty to furnish for her defence
in case she should be attacked. A declaration of the same
nature was made by the ambassador of her Imperial Ma∣jesty
the Queen of Hungary, while the ministers of France
and Prussia, who were in strict alliance with Sweden,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve her to understand, that they would punctually fulfill
their engagements with the court of Stockholm, should
she actually invade the Swedish territories of Finland. The
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pirit with which the King of Prussia exerted himself on
this occasion gave infinite umbrage to the Czarina, who,
<PB N="273" REF="281"/>
indeed, expressed her resentment, by treating the mini∣ster
of Brandenburgh with contemptuous neglect, and
even refused to favour him with an audience, till he should
be vested with the character of ambassador. Thus were
sown the feeds of misunderstanding between those two
powers, which, in the sequel, grew up to the most bitter
animosity, and served to inflame those dissentions which
have desolated the fairest provinces of Germany. The
remonstrance of his Prussian Majesty with respect to the
troubles of the North was couched in such terms as gave
dissatisfaction to the court of Petersburgh. The Russian
minister retired from Berlin without the ceremony of
taking leave, and the Prussian ambassador Warendorf was
recalled from the court of the Czarina.</P>
<P>§ XLII. The attention of his Britannick Majesty was
not wholly engrossed by the disputes between Russia and
Sweden. He had another object in view, which more
nearly concerned the interest of his German dominions;
and had set on foot two negociations of the utmost impor∣tance
to the commerce and advantage of Great-Britain.
His first and principal aim was, in conjunction with the
court of Vienna, to take such measures as would secure
the succession of the Imperial dignity to the Archduke
Joseph, eldest son and heir of the reigning Emperor. As
the previous step to that elevation, it was proposed to elect
this young prince King of the Romans; and for this
purpose it was necessary to procure a majority not only of
the electors, but also in the diet of the empire, through
which the proposal must have passed. No stone was left
unturned to reconcile this expedient to the German prin∣ces.
Subsidies were offered by the maritime powers of
England and the States-General to the Electors of Mentz
and Cologn; and a treaty of the same nature was con∣cluded
with the Elector of Bavaria, who, in consideration
of an annual subsidy, amounting to forty thousand pounds
sterling, two thirds to be paid by Britain, and the rest by
the States-General, engaged to keep in readiness a body
of six thousand infantry, as auxiliaries to the Maritime
<PB N="274" REF="282"/>
Powers, though not to act against the Emperor or empire;
and to join the interest of his Britannick Majesty in the
diet, as well as in the electoral college. In order to render
the King of Poland, Elector of Saxony, propitious to
this design, he was accommodated with the loan of
a very considerable sum, upon the mortgage of certain
bailiwicks and lordships belonging to the Saxon dominions.
Thus, a majority of the electors was secured, and such
foundations were laid for the success of this project, that
it was generally believed it would be accomplished in his
Britannick Majesty's next visit to his German dominions.
Hopes, it was said, were given to the King of Sweden,
that his concurrence would be gratified by erecting the
house of Hesse-Cassel, of which he was head, into a tenth
electorate. Arguments of an interesting nature were used
with the King of Prussia, and the Elector Palatine, that,
if possible, the diet might unanimously approve of this
measure, so necessary for establishing the peace of the
empire, and preventing such troubles as arose from a dis∣puted
succession at the death of Charles the Sixth. These
endeavours, however, did not succeed in their full ex∣tent.</P>
<P>§ XLIII. The King of Prussia, as Elector of Branden∣burgh,
opposed the election as unnecessary and improper,
on account of the health and vigour of the reigning em∣peror,
and the tender years of the Archduke. This
monarch had set himself up as a balance to the power of
the House of Austria, which had long aspired to absolute
dominion over its co-estates, and endeavoured to establish
an hereditary right of succession to the empire: he, there∣fore,
employed all his influence to frustrate the measure
proposed, either actuated by a spirit of pure patriotism, or
inspired with designs which he had not yet thought proper
to declare. The opposition was joined by the Elector
Palatine, and countenanced by the French King; who
protested, that, for the sake of peace, he would not oppose
this election, though contrary to the Golden Bull, pro∣vided
it should be confirmed by the unanimous consent of
<PB N="275" REF="283"/>
the electoral college: but, should any one member signify
his dissent, and he or any state of the empire claim the
protection and assistance of his Most Christian Majesty,
he could not dispense with granting both, in consequence
of his being guarantee of the treaty of Westphalia; an
engagement by which he was obliged to succour those
princes and states of the empire who might have recourse
to him, in case of any grievance they suffered, contrary to
what was stipulated in that constitution. This declaration
co-operating with the known character of his Prussian
Majesty, whose great army overawed Hanover and Bo∣hemia,
in all probability damped that vigour with which
the courts of Vienna and Herenhausen had hitherto pro∣secuted
this important negociation.</P>
<P>§ XLIV. The second object that employed the atten∣tion
of the British ministry was the establishment of the
precise limits of Acadia, or Nova-Scotia, where the new
colony had suffered great mischief and interruption from
the incursions of the Indians, excited to these outrages by
the subjects and emissaries of France. Commissaries had
been appointed, by both crowns, to meet at Paris, and
compromise these disputes: but the conferences were ren∣dered
abortive by every art of cavilling, chicanery, and
procrastination, which the French commissioners opposed
to the justice and perspicuity of the English claims. They
not only misinterpreted treaties, though expressed with
the utmost precision, and perplexed the conferences with
difficulties and matter foreign to the subject, but they
carried the finesse of perfidy so far as to produce false
charts and maps of the country, in which the rivers and
boundaries were misplaced and misrepresented. At this
time also the insincerity of the French court appeared in
affected delays and artful objections, with respect to the
evacuation of the neutral islands in the West-Indies; and
the governours of the British plantations, in different
parts of North-America, transmitted intelligence, that
the French had begun to make encroachments on the back
of the English colonies.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="284"/>
§ XLV. Perhaps the precarious footing on which the
peace stood between Great-Britain and France at this
juncture, and the critical situation of affairs in Ger∣many,
determined the ministry of England to compromise
all differences with Spain, upon such terms as at any
other time they would hardly have embraced. In order
to discuss those points between the two nations, which
had not been settled by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle,
conferences were also begun at Madrid, and carried on
by Mr. Keene, plenipotentiary of his Britannick Majesty,
and Don Joseph de Carvajal and Lancastro, the Spanish
King's minister. At length a treaty was concluded on
these conditions: The King of Spain engaged to pay, in
three months, to the South-Sea company of England
one hundred thousand pounds sterling, as an indemnification
for all claims upon his crown, by virtue of the
Assiento. In other respects, the trade and navigation of
the English to the ports of Spain were regulated by for∣mer
treaties. It was stipulated, That they should pay no
other duties than those that were exacted of them in the
reign of Charles II. of Spain: That they should be treated
on the footing of the most favoured nations; and con∣tinue
to enjoy the privilege of taking salt at the island of
Tortuga. But there was no article restricting the Spa∣nish
guarda costas from searching the British vessels on
the high seas; although, as we have already observed,
this insolent prerogative, assumed without right, and ex∣ercised
without humanity, was, in effect, the original
and sole cause of the late rupture, which had been at∣tended
with such enormous expense to the nation. It
must be owned, however, that his Catholick Majesty
was at this period extremely well disposed to live upon
good terms with Great-Britain. He was resolved to in∣dulge
his people with the blessings of peace, to propagate
a spirit of industry throughout his dominions, and in par∣ticular
to encourage commerce, which he foresaw would
prove a much more certain and inexhaustible source of
wealth, power, and influence, than all the treasures he could
<PB N="277" REF="285"/>
drain from the mines of Mexico and Peru. His resolu∣tions
on this interesting subject were chiefly directed by
Don Ricardo Wall, who now acted as his minister at
London; a gentleman of Irish extract, who had distin∣guished
himself in the field as well as in the cabinet, and
possessed the joint qualifications of a general and a states∣man.
He had, by virtue of a passport, come over pri∣vately
to England before the peace, in order to pave the
way for the treaty, by a secret negociation with the Eng∣lish
ministers; but, immediately after the peace was pro∣claimed,
he appeared in the character of ambassador.
He was possessed of the most insinuating address, shrewd,
penetrating, and inquisitive. While he resided in Lon∣don,
he spared no pains in learning the nature of
those manufactures, and that commerce, by which Great-Britain
had been so remarkably aggrandized; and on his
return to Spain, where in a little time he was placed at
the helm of affairs, he turned the knowledge he had thus
acquired to the advantage of his country. He not only
promoted the useful arts within the kingdom of Spain,
but demonstrated the infinite advantages that would accrue
from an active trade, which the Spaniards had for many
ages neglected; and in a few years their ships were seen
to swarm in all the commercial ports of Europe. Of
other foreign events which distinguished this summer,
the most remarkable was the death of John King of
Portugal, who perfectly understood, and steadily pursued,
the true interests of his country, and in whom many
princely qualities were debased by a cruel spirit of bigot∣ry
and superstition. He was succeeded by his eldest
son Joseph, who, if he has fallen short of his father in
some respects, cannot be justly charged with having in∣herited
this paternal weakness.</P>
<P>§ XLVI. The King of Great-Britain having returned
to England, opened the session of parliament in January
with a speech, importing, That he had concluded a
treaty with the King of Spain, and amicably adjusted
such differences as could not be so properly compromised
<PB N="278" REF="286"/>
in a general treaty: That the commerce of this nation
with that country was re-established upon the most ad∣vantageous
and sure foundations; and that there was the
greatest reason to hope the ancient friendship between
Great-Britain and Spain would, from mutual inclination
as well as interest, be now effectually restored. He told
them, That, in conjunction with the Empreses-Queen
and the States-General, he had concluded a treaty with
the Elector of Bavaria; and was employed in taking such
further measures as might best tend to strengthen and
secure the tranquillity of the Empire, support its system,
and timely anticipate such events as had been found by
experience to endanger the common cause, involve Eu∣rope
in the calamities of war, and occasion the loss of
much blood and treasure to these kingdoms. He promised,
that both these treaties should be subjected to their perusal:
he gave them to understand, That he had received from
all the other contracting powers in the definitive treaty
of Aix-la-Chapelle the most full and clear declarations
of their resolution to preserve the general peace; and
that he had taken care to consolidate the ties of union
and friendship between him and his allies, the better to
secure their mutual interests, maintain the peace already
subsisting, and prevent the occasion of any future rupture.
Finally, he recommended unanimity, the improvement
of commerce, and the effectual suppression of such out∣rages
and violences as are inconsistent with good order
and government, and endanger the lives and properties of
the subject, whose happiness and flourishing condition he
had entirely at heart.</P>
<P>§ XLVII. When the motion was made for an address
of thanks, couched in terms that favoured of the most
implicit complaisance, approbation, and acquiescence in
the measures which the crown had taken, the Earl of
Eg—t, and some other anti-courtiers, affirmed, that such
an address would be equally servile and absurd. They
observed, That nothing could be more preposterous than
a blind approbation of measures which they did not know:
<PB N="279" REF="287"/>
That nothing could be more ridiculous than their con∣gratulations
on the present happy tranquillity, when al∣most
every day's news-papers informed them of some
British ship's being seised by the Spaniards, or some new
attack made by the French on our infant colony in Nova-Scotia.
With respect to the continent of Europe, they
affirmed, That the tranquillity of Germany would have
been upon a much more solid foundation, had England
never interposed in the affairs of the Empire: in that
case the princes would of themselves have supported the
constitution of their own country: That the election of
an infant for king of the Romans was much more likely
to disturb than establish the tranquillity of Europe; be∣cause
it would help to overturn the constitution of the
Empire, by rendering the imperial dignity hereditary in
one house, instead of being the result of a free election.
They took notice, that the constitution had provided
vicars to govern the Empire during the vacancy of the
Imperial throne; but had made no provision of regents,
protectors, or guardians for a minor emperor, because it
was never supposed that a minor would be chosen. They
inveighed against the late treaty with Spain; in which,
they said, the ministry, for the paultry sum of one hundred
thousand pounds, had given up the claims of the South-Sea
company, and other British merchants, who had
suffered from depredations to the amount of one million
three hundred thousand pounds; and bartered away the
freedom of our trade and navigation, by leaving untouched
that prerogative which the Spaniards have assumed of
searching the British ships in the open seas, and confis∣cating
them, should they find on board the least particle
of what they called contraband merchandise. They pro∣duced
an instance of an English ship, lately driven by
stress of weather into one of the ports of the Spanish
West-Indies, where she was searched, seised, and con∣demned,
under this pretence. They re-capitulated the
conduct of the French, who, in the midst of their de∣clarations
of peace and moderation, were still employed
<PB N="280" REF="288"/>
in fortifying their settlements on the neutral islands, as
well as in harrassing and encroaching upon our plantations
in North-America. They exclaimed against the treaty
of subsidy with the Elector of Bavaria, or any other prince
in time of peace; observing, that for some years the
nation had paid such pensions to the Danes and the
Hessians; but, in the course of the late war the former
abandoned our interests, and the latter actually took arms
against Great-Britain. They affirmed, that the subsidy
was greater than the nation could spare; for, unless the
land-tax should be continued at four shillings in the pound,
they could not afford a shilling to any prince in Germany,
without encroaching upon the sinking fund. “At such
a juncture (said a certain member) will any gentleman
presume to propose the continuation of such an im∣position
on the land-holder, for the sake of bribing
the princes of Germany to do what?—to preserve
the freedom and independency of their native country.
I say, princes of Germany, because this subsi∣dy
to Bavaria will signify nothing, unless we take
half a score more of them into our pay; and when we
have thus indulged them for seven years of peace, they
may give us the slip, as others have done, whenever
another war shall be declared.” Against these objections
the motion was supported by Mr. William Pitt, at this time
an advocate for the ministry. He observed, That the address
was no more than the usual compliment to the throne, which
did not imply an obligation on the parliament to approve
of measures which they might find cause to censure upon
further enquiry. He said, the trivial disputes still subsist∣ing
between this nation and the Spaniards, or French,
would soon be terminated amicably, and could never
affect the general tranquillity of Europe, which was to
be established upon a firm alliance between his Majesty
and such a confederacy upon the continent as would be
an over-match for the house of Bourbon. He expatiated
upon his Majesty's wisdom in taking off from the French
interest such a powerful prince as the Elector of Bavaria,
<PB N="281" REF="289"/>
and concerting other salutary measures for preserving the
balance of power on the continent. he defended the arti∣cles
of the late treaty with Spain; observing, that what
remained of the Assiento contract was a matter of very
little consequence to the South-Sea company; that the
demands of this company, and other British merchants,
were all cancelled by the rupture with Spain, and more
than recompensed to the nation by a great balance of cap∣tures
during the war, as well as by the great traffick carried
on with the Spanish settlements in the West-Indies,
after it had been laid open by the demolition of thier
fortresses. He asserted, that by this treaty the court of
Spain had made many important concessions: they had
condescended to pay a great sum to the South-Sea company▪
they had consented to the re-establishment of the British
trade in Spain, upon a very advantageous and solid footing,
by agreeing that the subjects of Great Britain should
pay no other duties on merchandise than those exacted
of his Catholick Majesty's own subjects, and to abolish
all innovations that had been introduced into the commerce.
He affirmed, that the article of No Search was a stipulation
which it would have been ridiculous to insist upon; and
thought proper to obviate a reproach which he foresaw
the opposition would throw upon him, from the circum∣stance
of his having, upon a former occasion, heartily
concurred in a motion for an address, That no treaty of
peace with Spain should be admitted, unless such a stipu∣lation
should be first obtained as a preliminary. He owned
he had strenuously contended for such a motion, because
at that time, being very young and sanguine, he thought
it right and reasonable: but he was now ten years older,
had considered matters more coolly, and was convinced
that the privilege of No Search, with respect to British
vessels sailing near the American shore, would never be
obtained, unless Spain should be brought so low as to
acquiesce in any terms we as victors might propose. He
likewise signified his conviction, that all addresses from
the House of Commons, during the course of a war, for
<PB N="282" REF="290"/>
prescribing terms of peace, were in themselves ridiculous;
and that every such address was an encroachment on the
King's prerogative, which had always been attended with
unlucky consequences. How far these arguments are
satisfactory, conclusive, and consistent, we shall leave
to the reader's determination. Certain it is, they were
adopted by the majority, and the address was presented
without further opposition.</P>
<P>§ XLVIII. The two grand committees appointed to
discuss the supplies for the ensuing year, and the funds
upon which they were to be raised, proceeded, as usual,
under the direction of the ministry; yet not without
some vehement opposition, in which certain servants of
the crown expressed the most hearty concurrence. When
a motion was made for reducing the number of seamen to
eight thousand, Mr. W. Pitt, Mr. Lyttelton, and Mr.
G. Grenville, opposed it with all their might of argument
and elocution; but they were over-ruled. Annual de∣bates
were also revived, with the same success, upon
the number of troops constituting the standing army;
but the other resolutions of the grand committees met
with little or no opposition. The number of seamen for
the ensuing year was limited to eight thousand; and that
of the standing forces continued at eighteen thousand
eight hundred and fifty-seven effective men, including
one thousand eight hundred and fifteen invalids. The
Commons granted a considerable sum of money for pay∣ing
off the principal of such redeemable stocks as had not
been subscribed, in pursuance of two acts passed in the
last session for reducing the interest of annuities. Thirty
thousand pounds were given for fulfilling the King's en∣gagement
with the Elector of Bavaria: large grants were
made for supplying deficiencies, and replacing sums bor∣rowed
from the sinking-fund. The expense incurred by
the new colony in Nova-Scotia, not provided for by
parliament, exceeded fifty-seven thousand pounds; and
the maintenance of it for the ensuing year was fixed at
fifty-three thousand nine-hundred and twenty-seven
<PB N="283" REF="291"/>
pounds, fourteen shillings, and four-pence. An enor∣mous
charge! if we consider to how little purpose all
his bounty was bestowed. A fund was established un∣der
the sanction of parliament, for the relief and main∣tenance
of the widows of sea-officers, by allowing, upon
the books of every ship of war in sea-pay, the wages and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ctuals of one man for every hundred of which the com∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lement
shall consist, for such time only as the number
of men employed in the service of the royal navy shall
not exceed twenty thousand. This was an additional in∣dulgence,
over and above the allowance of one man
granted by a former act of parliament. On the whole,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he provisions of this year amounted to five millions
one hundred twenty-five thousand twenty-three pounds,
eleven shillings and seven-pence, to be raised by the usual
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uties: the sum of one million twenty-six thousand four
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>undred seventy-six pounds, four shillings, and six pence,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dvanced by the Bank of England, to pay off their own un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubcribed
annuities, for which they accepted Exchequer-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ills
at three per cent. interest; by the land-tax at three
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hillings in the pound; a lottery and annuities, at the rate
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f three per cent. per ann. to be charged on the sink∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng
fund, redeemable by parliament. The annual measure
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alled the mutiny-bill was not passed without dispute and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ltercation: some alterations were proposed, but not
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dopted; and the sentences of court-martials still subjected
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o one revision.</P>
<P>§ XLIX. In the midst of these deliberations the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingdom was alarmed with an event which overwhelmed
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he people with grief and consternation. His royal high∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess
the Prince of Wales, in consequence of a cold caught
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n his garden at Kew, was seised with a pleuretick disor∣der;
and, after a short illness, expired on the twentieth
day of March, to the unspeakable affliction of his royal
consort, and the unfeigned sorrow of all who wished
well to their country. This excellent prince, who now
died in the forty-fifth year of his age, was possessed of
every amiable quality which could engage the affection
of the people: a tender and obliging husband, a fond pa∣rent,
<PB N="284" REF="292"/>
a kind master, liberal, generous, candid, and hu∣mane;
a munificent patron of the arts, an unwearied
friend to merit; well disposed to assert the rights of man∣kind
in general, and warmly attached to the interest of
Great-Britain. The nation could not but be afflicted at
seeing a prince of such expectations ravished from their
hopes; and their grief was the better founded, as the
King had already attained to an advanced age, and the
heir apparent, George, now Prince of Wales, was a
minor.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE></P>
<P>§ L. His Majesty, foreseeing all the inconveniencies
which might arise from a minority, deliberated with his
council on this subject, and resolved to obtain a parlia∣mentary
sanction for the measures judged necessary to
secure the succession. With this view he sent a message to
both Houses on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wenty-sixth day of April, importing.
That nothing could conduce so much to the preservation
of the protestant succession in his royal family, as proper
provisions for the tuition of the person of his successor, and
for the regular administration of the government, in case
the successor should be of tender years: his Majesty, there∣fore,
earnestly recommended this weighty affair to the
deliberation of parliament; and proposed, that when the
imperial crown of these realms should descend to any of
the late prince's sons, being under the age of eighteen
years, his mother, the Princess Dowager of Wales, should
be guardian of his person, and regent of these kingdoms,
until he should attain the age of majority, with such pow∣ers
and limitations as should appear necessary and expedi∣ent
for these purposes. This message produced a very affec∣tionate
address, promising to take the affair into their serious
consideration: and in the beginning of May the Duke of
Newcastle presented to the House of Peers a bill to pro∣vide
for the administration of government, in case the
crown should descend to a minor. The bill was read a
second time, and committed, when a second message ar∣rived
from his Majesty, recommending to their consider∣ation
the settlement of such a council of regency as the
bill proposed, consisting of his royal highness the Duke
<PB N="285" REF="293"/>
of Cumberland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. I. 1751.</NOTE> who at that time commanded the army,
the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Chancellor, the
Lord-High Treasurer, or first lord commissioner of the
Treasury, the President of the Council, the Lord Privy-Seal,
the Lord High Admiral of Great-Britain, or first
commissioner of the Admiralty, the two principal Secre∣taries
of State, and the Lord Chief Justice of the King's-Bench,
all these great officers, except his royal highness
the Duke, for the time being. This bill did not pass
through the Lower House without violent debate and bitter
sarcasms. The council of regency, though espoused by
all the ministry, including the paymaster-general, met
with fierce opposition, as an unnecessary and fatal re∣striction,
that would impede the machine of government,
and, as the council was constituted, might be productive
of the most pernicious consequences. Some of the mem∣bers
ventured even to insinuate the danger of leaving at the
head of a large standing army a prince of the blood, vested
with a share of the regency, possessed of great personal
influence, the darling of the soldiery, brave, popular, and
enterprising; supposed not wholly devoid of ambition,
and not at all remarkable for any symptoms of extraordinary
affection towards the person of the heir apparent. The
history of England was ransacked for invidious instances
of royal uncles and regents, who had injured the sove∣reigns,
and distressed the government, by their pride,
cruelty, and ambition. The characters of John Lackland,
and John of Ghent, Humphrey and Richard Dukes of
Gloucester, were called in review, canvassed, compared,
and quoted, with some odious applications: but the ma∣jority,
being convinced of the loyalty, virtue, integrity,
and great abilities of his royal highness, to whom the
nation owed obligations of the most important nature, pas∣sed
the bill with a few amendments, in which the Lords
acquiesced; and in a little time it received the royal sanction.</P>
<P>§ LI. The death of the Prince of Wales was fatal to a
bill which had been brought into the House of Commons,
for naturalizing all foreign protestants who should settle
within the dominions of Great-Britain. Political arithme∣ticians
<PB N="286" REF="294"/>
have generally taken it for granted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1751.</NOTE> that to every
commercial nation an increase of people is an increase of
opulence; and this maxim is certainly true, on the suppo∣sition
that every individual is industrious, and that there is
a sufficient field for employment; but all these genera
maxims ought to be received under certain qualifications
When all branches of manufacture are overstocked, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
addition of workmen will doubtless be an additional incum∣brance
on the community. In the debates which this
bill produced, the members of the ministry were divided
among themselves. The measure was enforced by the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. W. Pitt, and Mr. Lyt∣telton;
and in opposing it the Earl of Egmont was joined
by Mr. Fox, secretary at war. Petitions and counter-petitions
were presented by the merchants of London,
Bristol, and other trading towns of the kingdom. All
merchants and traders of foreign extraction exerted them∣selves
vigorously in its behalf, and it was without doubt
countenanced by the administration; but the project was
odious to the people in general. The Lord-Mayor, alder∣men,
and commons of London, in common council
assembled, composed a remonstrance to the Lower House,
setting forth the danger and inutility of a general naturali∣zation
of foreign protestants. A petition of the merchants
and principal inhabitants of Bristol represented that such a
law would be prejudicial to the trade and commerce of
this kingdom, by preventing many industrious artificers
from procuring a sufficient support for themselves and their
families, and of consequence increasing the rates of the
poor: that the introduction of such a number of foreigners
instead of being a support to the present happy establish∣ment,
might endanger the very basis of our constitution:
that it would greatly tend to the diminution of our manu∣factures,
as many strangers would doubtless come and reside
in England for a time, in order to learn the methods and ma∣nagement
of our manufacturers and artificers; and, after
having obtained this instruction, return to their native
countries, where they would establish and carry on works
of the same nature. The twentieth day of March being
<PB N="287" REF="295"/>
appointed for the third reading of the bill, it was postpon∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,
in consequence of the unfortunate death of the Prince
of Wales; and other petitions from different cities of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingdom being mustered against it in the sequel, the mi∣nistry
did not think proper to persist in an unpopular mea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure
at such a delicate conjuncture; so the bill was no more
brought upon the carpet. Divers other regulations, relat∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng
to civil policy as well as to the commerce of Great-Britain,
were propounded in the House of Commons;
but these proposals proved abortive, either because they ap∣peared
crude and indigested in themselves, or the House
could not obtain proper information touching the allegati∣ons
they contained.</P>
<P>§ LII. There were no other transactions in this session
except the concurrence of both Houses in stigmatising a
printed paper, intituled “Constitutional Queries, earnest∣ly
recommended to the serious consideration of every
true Briton;” and the steps taken by the Commons, in
consequence of the commotions occasioned by the West∣minster
election. The abovementioned paper, which had
been conveyed by letter to the majority of both Houses,
was communicated to the Lords in the month of January
by the Duke of Marlborough, who moved for resolutions
against it as a seditious libel, and that the concurrence of
the Commons might be desired. A conference accordingly
ensued, and both houses concurred in voting the paper a
false, malicious, scandalous, infamous, and seditious libel,
containing the most false, audacious, and abominable
calumnies and indignities upon his majesty, and the most
presumptuous and wicked insinuations that our laws, liber∣ties,
and properties, and the excellent constitution of this
kingdom, were in danger under his Majesty's legal, mild,
and gracious government, with intent to instill groundless
suspicions and jealousies into the minds of his Majesty's
good subjects, and to alienate their affections from his
Majesty and his royal family. It was, therefore, resolved
by the Lords spiritual and temporal and Commons in par∣liament
assembled, That, in abhorrence and detestation of
such abominable and seditious practices, the paper should
<PB N="288" REF="296"/>
be burnt by the hands of the common hangman in the new
Palace-yard of Westminster; and this sentence was execut∣ed
accordingly. Then they presented an address to his Ma∣jesty,
desiring that the most effectual means might be taken
for discovering the author, printer, or publisher, that he
or they might be brought to condign punishment. Direc∣tions
were given for this purpose; but without effect.
Those concerned in writing, printing, and circulating
the paper had acted with such caution, that not one of
them was ever discovered.</P>
<P>§ LIII. The proceedings of the Commons with respect
to the election of a burgess for Westminster were attended
with some extraordinary circumstances, which we shall
now record, for the edification of those who pique them∣selves
on the privileges of a British subject. We have
already observed, that a majority appearing on the poll for
Lord Trentham, the adherents of the other canditate, Sir
George Vandeput, demanded a scrutiny, which was granted
by the high-bailiff of Westminster, the returning officer.
During this tedious investigation, which rolled chiefly on the
qualification of voters, he acted with such address and
seeming candour as gave entire satisfaction to both parties,
till at length he determined in favour of Lord Trentham,
whom he returned as duly elected. Those who stiled them∣selves
the independent electors did not acquiesce in this
determination without clamour, reproach, menaces, and
riot. They taxed Mr. Leigh, the high-bailiff, with par∣tiality
and injustice: they loudly affirmed, that ministerial
influence had been used in the most scandalous manner;
and, finally, joined Sir George Vandeput in a petition to
the Lower House, complaining of an undue election and
return of a member for the city of Westminster. The
Commons, instead of enquiring into the merits of these pe∣titions,
ordered them to lie upon the table; and, without
any complaint from any person whatever, a motion was
made, that Leigh, the high-bailiff, should attend the House
immediately, in order to make them acquainted with what
he had done in pursuance of the directions he had formerly
<PB N="289" REF="297"/>
received from that House,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. I. 1754.</NOTE> touching the execution of the
writ for electing a new member to represent the city of
Westminster. As this motion had been preconcerted, Leigh
was attending in the lobby, and immediately called into
the House to be examined on this subject. Having, in the
course of his examination, alledged that the election had
been protracted by affected delays, he was asked by whom,
and by what means; but, before he could answer, the
Earl of Egmont, interposing, objected to the question as
improper, and moved for the order of the day. A debate
immediately ensued, in which the impropriety of the que∣stion
was demonstrated by Mr. Henley, now lord-keeper,
Dr. Lee, and some others, the most sensible and moderate
members of the House: but they were opposed with great
violence by Lord Viscount Corke, Henry Fox, Esq. Sir
William Yonge, Colonel Lyttelton, and the weight of
the ministry; so that the motion for the order of the day
was carried in the negative, and the high bailiff required to
answer the question. Thus interrogated, he declared
that he had been impeded in the scrutiny, and mal-treated,
by Mr. Crowle, who had acted as counsel for Sir George
Vandeput, by the honourable Alexander Murray, brother
to Lord Elibank, and one Gibson, an upholsterer, who had
been very active, zealous, and turbulent in his endeavours
to promote the interest of Sir George Vandeput, or rather
to thwart the pretensions of the other candidate, who was
supposed to be countenanced by the ministry. These
three persons, thus accused, were brought to the bar of
the House, notwithstanding the strenuous remonstrances of
several members, who opposed this method of proceeding,
as a species of oppression equally arbitrary and absurd.
They observed, that, as no complaint had been preferred,
they had no right to take cognizance of the affair: that
if any undue influence had been used, it would na∣turally
appear when the merits of the election should
fall under their enquiry: that a complaint having been
lodged already against the returning officer, it was their
duty to investigate his conduct, and punish him, if he
<PB N="290" REF="298"/>
should be found delinquent; but that nothing could be
more flagrantly unjust, and apparently partial, than their
neglecting the petitions of the other candidate and electors,
and encouraging the high-bailiff, who stood charged with
iniquity, to recriminate upon his accusers, that they might
be disabled from giving evidence on the enquiry into the
merits of the election. What difference is it to the sub∣ject,
whether he is oppressed by an arbitrary prince, or by
the despotick insolence of a ministerial majority? Mr.
Crowle alledged, in his own vindication, that he had been
employed as a counsel by the electors of Westminster, and
attended the scrutiny in that character; that after the high-bailiff
had, in the course of the last session, received the
order of the House to expedite the election, he hurried on
the scrutiny with such precipitation as, he apprehended,
was unjust, and prejudicial to his clients; that, in this
apprehension, he, (Mr. Crowle) insisted upon the high-bailiff's
proceeding with more deliberation, and in so doing
he thought he did his duty to his employers. Some evi∣dence
being examined against him, declared he had not
only protracted the scrutiny, but also spoken disrespectful
words of the House of Commons: he was, therefore, repri∣manded
on his knees by the Speaker, and discharged.</P>
<P>§ LIV. Mr. Murray being charged with having utter∣ed
some threatening and affrontive expressions, the House
adjourned the consideration of this affair for some days, at
the expiration of which Mr. Murray was to be heard by
his counsel: but, in the mean time, they ordered him to be
taken into custody by the serjeant at arms attending the
House. This step, however, was not taken without a
warm opposition by some of the most sedate and intelligent
members of the House, who considered it as a cruel act of
oppression. They observed, that in cases of breach of
privilege no person complained of was ever taken into
custody, until after he had been fully heard in his defence:
that this was literally prejudging the cause before it had
been examined; and the oppression was the greater, as the
alledged offence consisted entirely of words, of which no
<PB N="291" REF="299"/>
complaint or information had been made for above eight
months after the supposed offence had been committed;
and, even then, not till an accusation had been lodged
against the informant, upon the trial of which accusation
the persons informed against might very probably be the
most material witnesses. They observed, that in one of
the highest offences which can be committed by words,
namely, that of denying the King's right to the crown,
or renouncing the Trinity, the information must be brought
in three or four days after the words are spoken; the words
must be proved to have been spoken maliciously, direct∣ly,
and advisedly, and the prosecution must commence in
three months after the information. These suggestions
made no more impression than if they had been uttered in
a desert. Those who were secure in their number asserted
that the House of Commons was not restricted by the forms
of proceedings at common law; and that it was necessary
to vindicate their own honour and dignity, by making ex∣amples
of those who seemed to hold them in contempt.
Mr. Murray was committed to the custody of the serjeant
at arms, and found bail; and Gibson was sent prisoner to
Newgate, from whence he was in a few days released, upon
presenting an humble petition, professing his sorrow for
having incurred the displeasure of the House, to the bar
of which he was brought, and received a reprimand on his
knees from the Speaker. In the mean time, divers wit∣nesses
being examined before the House, declared. That
Mr. Murray had been seen, about the time of the return of
a member for Westminster, heading and exciting a tumult
to acts of violence against the high-bailiff. The majority,
therefore, after a long and warm debate, agreed, That for
his dangerous and seditous practices, in violation and con∣tempt
of the privileges of the House, and of the freedom of
elections, he should be committed close prisoner to New∣gate.
Then, in the close of another violent debate, they
resolved, That he should be brought to the bar of the
House, to receive that sentence on his knees. He accord∣ingly
appeared, and being directed by the Speaker to kneel,
<PB N="292" REF="300"/>
refused to comply. He knew that he could not be dis∣charged
from Newgate during the session, without petition∣ing,
acknowledging his offence, and making such con∣cessions
as he thought would imply a consciousness of
guilt: he considered this whole transaction as an oppressive
exertion of arbitrary power, and, being apprised of the
extent of their authority, determined to bear the brunt of
their indignation, rather than make submissions which he
deemed beneath the dignity of his character. When he
refused to humble himself the whole house was in commo∣tion;
he was no sooner removed from the war than they
resolved, That his having in a most insolent and audacious
manner refused to be on his knees at the bar of that House, in
consequence of their former resolution, was a high and
most dangerous contempt of the authority and privilege of
the Commons: it was, therefore, ordered, that he should be
committed close prisoner to Newgate, debarred the use of
pen, ink, and paper; and that no person should have access
to him, without the leave of the House. Finally, a committee
wes appointed to consider what methods might be proper to
be taken by them, in relation to this instance of contempt.
Mean while, the petitioners against the return made by the
high-bailiff, perceiving the temper of the House, and the
complexion of the majority, withdrew their petition; and
the order which had passed for hearing the merits of the
election was discharged. Mr. Murray being taken dan∣gerously
ill in Newgate, application was made to the Com∣mons,
by some of his relations, that he might be removed
to a more convenient situation; and his physician being
examined, gave it as his opinion that he was infected
with the gaol distemper. Upon this representation the
House agreed that the Speaker should issue a Warrant for
removing him from Newgate to the custody of the serjeant
at arms; but this favour he refused to accept, and ex∣pressed
the warmest resentment against those relations who
had applied to the Commons in his behalf. Thus he re∣mained
sequestered even from his own brother and sister,
under the displeasure of the Commons of England, who
<PB N="293" REF="301"/>
condescended so far as to make resolutions touching the
physician,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. I. 1751.</NOTE> apothecary, and nurse who attended this pri∣soner.
But the prorogation of parliament having put an
end to their authority for that session, Mr. Murray was
discharged of course, and conducted by the sheriffs from
Newgate to his own house, in procession, with flags and
streamers, exhibiting the emblems of liberty.</P>
<P>§ LV. In the month of June the session was closed with
a speech from the throne, in which his Majesty thanked
both Houses for the zeal and affection they had manifested
towards him and his government; and congratulated the
Commons in particular, upon their firmness and prudence
in reducing the interest of the national debt, a measure as
agreeable to him as essential to the strength and welfare of
the kingdom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of the most remarkable acts which passed in the course of this ses∣sion, was that for regulating the commencement of the year, and correcting the calendar, according to the Gregorian computation, which had been adopted by all the other nations in Europe.

By this establishment of the new stile, the equinoxes and solstices will hap∣pen nearly on the same nominal days on which they fell in the year 325, at the council of Nice; and the correspondence between the English mer∣chants and those of foreign countries will be greatly facilitated, with res∣pect to the dates of letters and accounts.</NOTE>.—The interior oeconomy of Great-Britain

<P><PB N="296" REF="304"/>
THE royal family of England had sustained
three severe shocks in the compass of a few
months. Besides the loss of the Prince of Wales, which
the nation lamented as irreparable, his majesty was deeply
afflicted by the untimely death of his youngest daughter,
the Queen of Denmark, who died at Copenhagen, on the
nineteenth day of December, in the prime of youth. She
was one of the most amiable princesses of the age in which
she lived, whether we consider the virtues of her heart, or
the accomplishments of her person; generous, mild, and
tender-hearted; beloved even almost to adoration by her
royal consort, to whom she had borne a prince and two
princesses; and universally admired and revered by the
subjects of his Danish Majesty. Her death had been pre∣ceeded
about two months by that of her brother-in-law, the
Prince of Orange, no less regretted by the natives of the
United Provinces, for his candour, integrity, and heredita∣ry
love to his country. Though he had not distinguished
himself by the lustre of a superior genius, he had been at
great pains to cultivate his understanding, and study the
true interest of that community of which he was a mem∣ber.
He had always approved himself a good and zealous
citizen, and, since his elevation to the stadtholdership,
taken many salutary steps for the advantage of his country.
Among other excellent schemes which he suggested, he
left a noble plan with the States-General for restoring their
commerce to its former lustre, and lived long enough to
receive their warmest acknowledgements for this last proof
of his prudence and patriotism. His son and daughter
being both infants, the administration of the government
devolved upon the princess, as gouvernante during her son's
minority; and as such she succ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eded to all the power
which her husband had enjoyed.</P>
<P>§ II. With respect to the affairs of the continent, the
peace of the North seemed still as precarious as ever: for
though the difference between Russia and Sweden had been
compromised, the mutual disgust between the Czarina and
the King of Prussia had gained such accession from recipro∣cal
<PB N="297" REF="305"/>
insults, ill offices, and inflammatory declarations, that
these two powers seemed to be on the eve of a rupture, and
each was employed in making extraordinary preparations
for war. The courts of Vienna and Great-Britain, fore∣seeing
that such a rupture would embroil the empire, and
raise insurmountable obstructions to their favourite scheme
of electing the Archduke Joseph king of the Romans,
resolved to employ all their influence, in order to effect a
reconciliation between the courts of Petersburgh and
Berlin. His Prussian Majesty had signified to the King of
Great-Britain, and the States-General, the situation in
which he stood with the Czarina, and sollicited their inter∣position,
that the difference might be amicably accommo∣dated.
At the same time, he sent an envoy extraordinary
to Versailles, to negociate with the French King a very
considerable body of auxiliaries, in case he should be at∣tacked.
These circumstances induced the Maritime
Powers, and the court of Vienna, to use their utmost en∣deavours
for the prevention of a rupture; and accordingly
they made remonstrances on this subject by their ministers
at Petersburgh, proposing that the quarrel should be ter∣minated
without bloodshed, and all cause of animosity be
buried in oblivion.</P>
<P>§ III. In the mean time, they eagerly prosecuted the
design of the election; and the Imperial minister at Berlin
not only communicated to his Prussian Majesty the senti∣ments
of the King of England on this expedient, but even
sollicited his vote for the Archduke Joseph, when the
election of a king of the Romans should be proposed
in the electoral college. To this proposal he replied,
That he was extremely well disposed to manifest his re∣gard
for their Imperial Majesties, and to give them most
genuine proofs of it, even in the proposed election of a
king of the Romans, considering the great merit of the
present candidate, the Archduke Joseph: but he left it to
the consideration of their Imperial Majesties, whether the
election would not be a little premature, if transacted at a
time when his Imperial Majesty was in the flower of his
<PB N="298" REF="306"/>
age, enjoying perfect health; and when all Europe, parti∣cularly
the Empire, was hushed in the bosom of tran∣quility,
so that no circumstance seemed to prognosticate
the necessity of such an election; or of putting in executi∣on
the motives mentioned in the capitulation of the reign∣ing
Emperor's election; especially, as the examination of
these motives belonged to the whole Empire, and ought to
precede the election, by virtue of the eighth article of the
treaty of Westphalia. He observed, that, in case of the
Emperor's death, Germany would find herself in a very
disagreeable situation, under the government of a minor.
For these reasons, he said, he could not help advising their
Imperial Majesties to wait until the Archduke should be
of age, when his election might be carried on more con∣formably
to the laws and constitution of the Empire, and
more suitable to the majesty of the whole Germanick body.
This reply he circulated among the electors, and in par∣ticular
transmitted it to the King of Great-Britain, de∣siring
they would deliberate maturely on this subject, and
confer together in a body, as well as in private, that they
might proceed according to the ancient custom of the
electoral college, and take such measures as should be judg∣ed
expedient for the honour and advantage of the commu∣nity.
This circular letter was answered both by the King
of England and the Elector of Bavaria, who demonstrated,
that it was the privilege of the electoral college only, with∣out
any participation of the other princes of the Empire, to
elect a king of the Romans during the life of the Emperor,
in order to maintain the peace and preserve the liberties of
Germany; and that the neglect of this wise precaution hath
produced bloody wars, and many fatal consequences to the
Empire. They observed, that nothing could more contri∣bute
to the establishment of the publick tranquillity than this
measure, so ardently desired by the majority of the German<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
princes; and that, although the Archduke Joseph wanted
a few years of being of age, and it might possibly happen
that the reigning Emperor should die during that prince's
minority, yet it would be much less prejudicial to the Em∣pire
<PB N="299" REF="307"/>
to have a minor chief, than to see the succession alto∣gether
unsettled. His Prussian Majesty received a declara∣tion
to the same purpose from the elector of Mentz; and
understanding that this prince, as arch-chancellor of the
Empire, intended to convoke an electoral diet, in order to
propose the election of the king of the Romans, he wrote
an elaborate letter to his Electoral Highness, explaining at
more length his reasons for postponing the election. He
quoted that sentence of the treaty of Westphalia which ex∣presly
declares, that the election of the king of the Ro∣mans
shall be discussed and ordained by the common con∣sent
of the states of the empire; and, therefore, he could
not conceive what right the electoral college had to arro∣gate
this privilege to themselves, excluding the other states
of the Empire. He observed, that the Imperial capitulati∣ons,
which were the only laws of the Empire that treated of
this subject, mentioned only three cases in which it was
lawful to proceed to such an election; namely, the Empe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or's
leaving and long absence from Germany; his advanc∣ed
age, or an indisposition, rendering him incapable of
managing the reins of government; and any case of emer∣gency
in which the preservation of the Empire's prosperity
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s interested. He affirmed, that none of these motives at
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>resent existed: that, in case the Imperial crown should
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evolve to a minor, many mischiefs and disorders must
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsue, as the constitutions of the Empire have established
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o regulations nor regency in that event: that an electi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n
of this nature, carried on under the power, influence,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd authority of the head of the Empire, would strike at
he fundamental privileges of the princes and states; con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>equently,
in time overturn the constitution of the Em∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire,
which, from being an elective dignity, conferred by
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he free and independent suffrages of the electoral college
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd states of Germany, under certain capitulations,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bliging the prince thus chosen to govern according to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aw, would become an hereditary succession, perpetu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed
in one family, which, of course, must be aggran∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ised
to the prejudice of its co-estates, and the ruin of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Germanick liberties. In a word, all Germany in ge∣neral,
<PB N="300" REF="308"/>
and Ratisbon in particular, was filled with wri∣tings
published on both sides, by the Emperor and
his adherents, to demonstrate that the election of a
king of the Romans, during the life of the Emperor, had
often happened, and at this present time was necessary,
and would be advantageous to the Empire: while the King
of Prussia and his friends laboured to prove that such an
election, at the present juncture, would be ill-timed, irre∣gular,
and of dangerous consequence. Perhaps, if the
truth was known, this enterprising prince had projected
some great scheme, with the execution of which this pro∣posed
establishment would have interfered. Certain it is,
he exerted himself with that spirit and perseverance which
are peculiar to his character to frustrate the intention of
the courts of Vienna and London in this particular, and
was assisted with all the intrigue of the French ministry.
Their joint endeavours were so effectual, that the Elector
of Cologn renounced his subsidiary treaty with the Mari∣time
Powers, and once more threw himself into the arms of
France. The Elector Palatine being sollicited by the Em∣press-Queen
and his Britannick Majesty to co-operate
with their views, insisted, as a preliminary article, upon
being indemnified by the court of Vienna for the ravages
committed in his territories by the Austrian troops, dur∣ing
the course of the last war: the King of Poland,
Elector of Saxony, made the same demand of the like
indemnification, which was granted by the mediation
of King George; and then he subscribed to a subsi∣dy-treaty,
obliging himself to furnish a body of six
thousand auxiliaries, in case they should be required by
the Maritime Powers; and to act as elector, in con∣cert
with the house of Austria, in every thing relating to
the welfare of his country that should square with the
fundamental laws of the Empire. The courts of London
and Vienna had this election so much at heart, that they
sounded almost all the powers of Europe, to know how
they stood affected towards the measure proposed. The
King of Spain declined intermeddling in a domestick affai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of the Empire. The French King returned an ambiguou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
answer; from whence it was concluded, that nothing bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="301" REF="309"/>
opposition could be expected from that quarter. The
Swedish monarch was rendered propitious to the project,
by assurances that the House of Hesse-Cassel, of which he
was the head, should be elevated into an electorate. They
even endeavoured to soften his Prussian Majesty, by con∣senting,
at last that the treaty of Dresden, confirming to
him the possession of Silesia, should be guaranteed by the
diet of th Empire; a sanction which he now actually ob∣tained,
together with the ratification of his Imperial Ma∣jesty.
Notwithstanding this indulgence, he still persisted
in raising fresh objections to the favourite project, on pre∣tence
of concerting measures for preventing the inconve∣niences
that might result from a minority; for regulating
the capitulations to be agreed on with the King of the Ro∣mans;
securing the freedom of future elections, and pre∣serving
the prerogatives and privileges of the Germanick
body in all its members. In consequence of these obstacles,
joined to the apostacy of the Elector of Cologn, the obsti∣nacy
of the Elector Palatine, and the approaching diet of
Hungary, at which their Imperial Majesties were obliged
personally to preside, the measures for the election were
suspended till next summer, when his Britannick Majesty
was expected at Hanover, to put the finishing stroke to
this great event in favour of the house of Austria.</P>
<P>§ IV. Another disappointment with respect to this
election the promoters of it sustained in the death of his
Swedish Majesty, who expired in a good old age, and
was succeeded by Adolphus Frederick, Duke of Holstein
Eutin, Bishop of Lubeck, upon whom the succession had
been settled for some years, by the unanimous concurrence
of the states of the kingdom. This prince ascended the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrone of Sweden without the least disturbance; and, of
his own accord, took an oath in full senate, that he would
never attempt to introduce a despotick authority; but
maintain their liberties with his blood, and govern his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubjects in all respects according to the laws, and the
form of government established in Sweden. This publick
act, which was communicated to all the foreign ministers,
<PB N="302" REF="310"/>
and particularly to the envoy from Petersburgh, met with
such a favourable reception from the Czarina, that she ex∣pressed
her satisfaction in a publick declaration; and the
good understanding between the two courts was perfectly
restored.</P>
<P>§ V. When the parliament of England was opened,
in the month of November, the King, in his speech from
the throne, gave them to understand, That, for the same
purposes which suggested the treaty with the Elector of
Bavaria, he had now, in conjunction with the States-Gene∣ral,
concluded another with the King of Poland, Elector
of Saxony. He told them, that the unfortunate death of
the Prince of Orange had made no alteration in the state
of affairs in Holland; and that he had received the strong∣est
assurances from the States, of their firm resolution to
maintain the intimate union and friendship happily sub∣sisting
between his Majesty and those ancient and natural
allies of his crown. He exhorted both Houses to consider
seriously of some effectual provisions, to suppress those au∣dacious
crimes of robbery and violence, grown so frequent
about the capital, proceeding in a great measure from that
profligate spirit of irreligion, idleness, gaming, and extra∣vagance,
which had of late extended itself in an uncom∣mon
degree, to the dishonour of the nation, and the great
offence and prejudice of the sober and industrious part of
the people. The paragraphs of this speech were, as usual,
ecchoed back to the throne in addresses, replete with ex∣pressions
of loyalty, affection, and approbation. Opposi∣tion
was by this time almost extinguished; and the pro∣ceedings
of both Houses took place with such unanimity
as was hardly ever known before this period in a British
parliament. The Commons, however, seem to have
assembled with such sentiments as did no great honour to
their temper and magnanimity. In a few days after the
session opened, Lord Viscount C—e, a young nobleman,
whose character entitled him to very little regard or
influence among men of sense and probity, made a motion,
that Mr. Murray, who had been so severely persecuted in
<PB N="303" REF="311"/>
the last session for refusing to humble himself on his knees
before them, should be again committed close prisoner to
Newgate for the same offence. This proposal, which
supposed a power that the Commons had never before ex∣ercised,
was sharply disputed by the Earl of Eg—t,
and others, who had not resigned all sense of modera∣tion;
but the majority adopted the measure with great
eagerness, and the Speaker was ordered to issue his war∣rant
accordingly. Then the House resolved, That the
said Alexander Murray should receive the sentence, for
his now being committed close prisoner to his Majesty's
gaol of Newgate, at the bar of the House, upon his knees;
and the serjeant at arms was commanded to take him into
custody for this purpose. Their indignation, however, was
eluded by the caution of the delinquent, who, having fore∣seen
the effects of their resentment, had prudently retired to
another country. They determined, nevertheless, to pro∣ceed
against him as a person of some consequence in the
commonwealth; for, being informed of his retreat, they
condescended so far as to present an address to his Ma∣jesty,
desiring that his royal proclamation might be issued
for apprehending the said Mr. Murray, promising a re∣ward
to him who should have the good fortune to appre∣hend
this fugitive—a request with which his Majesty most
graciously complied.</P>
<P>§ VI. Nor was this the only address presented to the
King upon such an important subject. A pamphlet, in∣tituled,
“The Case of the Hon. Alexander Murray,
Esquire, in an Appeal to the people of Great-Britain,”
was first stigmatized in a complaint to the House, and af∣terwards
produced, and read at the table. The piece was
written with great acrimony, and abounded with severe
animadversions, not only upon the conduct of the return∣ing
officer, but also on the proceedings of the Commons.
The violent members immediately took fire, and the
flame extended itself to the majority. Nay, the House
unanimously resolved, That the pamphlet was an impu∣dent,
malicious, scandalous, and seditious libel, falsely and
<PB N="304" REF="312"/>
most injuriously reflecting upon, and aspersing the proceed∣ings
of the House, tending to create misapprehensions in
the minds of the people, to the great dishonour of the
said House, and in violation of the privileges thereof.
They furthermore presented an address to the King, de∣siring
his Majesty would be graciously pleased to give
directions to his attorney-general to prosecute the authors
or author, the printers or printer, and the publishers or
publisher of the said scandalous libel, that they might be
brought to condign punishment. Directions were accord∣ingly
given for this purpose, and a prosecution commenced
against the publisher, who had some reason to be dismayed,
considering the great weight of influence he was doomed
to encounter—influence arising from a prosecution of the
crown, instituted at the request, and founded on a vote
of the House of Commons. Nevertheless, when the cause
was heard before the Lord Chief Justice of England, a
jury of free-born Englishmen, citizens of London, assert∣ed
their privilege of judging the law as well as the fact,
and acquitted the defendant with a truly admirable spirit
of independency. They considered the pamphlet as an
appeal against oppression; and, convinced that the con∣tents
were true, they could not in conscience adjudge it a
false libel, even though it had been so declared by one of
the branches of the legislature.</P>
<P>§ VII. The Commons, in regulating the supplies of
the ensuing year, voted the continuation of eighteen thou∣sand
eight hundred and fifty-seven men for the land-ser∣vice,
though not without some opposition from certain
patriots, who, rather from a sense of duty than from any
hope of influencing the majority, affirmed, that sixteen
thousand men, in time of peace, would answer all the ends
proposed by a standing army. The number of seamen
was fixed at ten thousand; large sums were granted to
make up deficiencies, and fulfill the engagements of the
crown with the Electors of Bavaria and Saxony, as well
as for the maintenance of Nova-Scotia and Georgia, and
the castles on the coast of Guinea; and one hundred and
<PB N="305" REF="313"/>
twelve thousand one hundred and fifty-two pounds, three
shillings, and three-pence were voted, as a full compensation
to the old royal African company for their exclusive charter
and property, to be applied for the relief of their creditors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These expenses were desrayed by a continuation of the duties on ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, &amp;c. a-land tax at three shillings in the pound; a duty on licenses to be yearly paid by pawnbrokers and dealers in second-hand goods, within the bills of mortality; the sum of one million four hundred thousand pounds, advanced by the Bank, according to a proposal made for that purpose; five hundred thousand pounds to be issued from the sinking fund; a duty laid on gum senaga; and the continuation of divers other occasional impositions. The grants for the year amounted to something less than four millions, and the provisions made for this expense exceeded it in the sum of two hundred seventy-one thousand twenty-four pounds, ten shillings, and six-pence half-penny.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>§ VIII. The laws enacted for the encouragement of
traffick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1752.</NOTE> and the regulations of civil polity, consisted in an
act for licensing pawnbrokers, and for the more effectual
preventing the receiving of stolen goods: another for pre∣venting
thefts and robberies, by which places of enter∣tainment,
dancing, and musick in London, Westminster,
and within twenty miles of the capital, were suppressed
and prohibited, unless the proprietors of them could ob∣tain
licenses from the justices of the peace, empowered
for that purpose: a third for annexing the forfeited estates
in Scotland unalienably in the crown, after having made
satisfaction to the lawful creditors; establishing a method
of leasing these estates, and applying the rents and profits
of them to the better civilising and improving the High∣lands,
and preventing future disorders in that part of the
united kingdom. Nothing could be more salutary than
the purposes of these regulations. The suburbs of the
metropolis abounded with an incredible number of publick
houses, which continually resounded with the noise of
riot and intemperance: they were the haunts of idleness,
fraud, and rapine; and the seminaries of drunkenness,
debauchery, extravagance, and every vice incident to
human nature: yet the suppression of these receptacles
of infamy was attended with an inconvenience, which, in
some cases, arose even to a degree of oppression. The
<PB N="306" REF="314"/>
justices being vested,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1752.</NOTE> by the legislature, with the power of
granting or refusing licenses, were constituted, in effect,
the arbiters on whose decision the fortunes and livelihood
of many individuals absolutely depended. Many of those
who exercised this species of magistracy within the bills
of mortality were, to the reproach of government, men of
profligate lives, needy, mean, ignorant, and rapacious,
and often acted from the most scandalous principles of
selfish avarice</P>
<P>§ IX. The law relating to the Highlands of Scotland
was well calculated for promoting, among the inhabitants
of that country, such a spirit of industry as might detach
them from their dangerous connexions, and gradually
supersede that military genius which has been so productive
of danger and alarm to the southern parts of Great-Bri∣tain.
The King, by this act, was empowered to appoint
commissioners for managing the forfeited estates; who were
énabled to grant leases of small farms, not above twenty
pounds a-year, to individuals, who should take an oath to
government to reside upon and cultivate the lands thus
let. It was also provided, that no lease should be granted
for a longer term than twenty-one years; and that the
lesses should not pay above three-fourths of the annual
value. Although these forfeited estates were generally
encumbered with claims beyond their real value, and the
act directed that they should be disposed of by publick sale;
yet, as they lay in the most disaffected parts of the High∣lands,
it was thought necessary that they should remain in
the possession of the crown, because, in case of their
being publickly sold, they might be purchased in trust for
the families of the persons by whom they were forfeited,
and thus the spirit of disaffection would still survive. A
valuation, therefore, was made by the court of session in
Scotland, at the joint suit of the crown and the creditors;
and the value being ascertained, the just claimants were
paid out of the next aids granted by parliament. The
bill met with considerable opposition in the House of
Peers from the Duke of Bedsord and the Earl of Bath,
<PB N="307" REF="315"/>
who probably foresaw that the good effects of this scheme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. II. 1752.</NOTE>
so laudable in itself, would be frustrated in the execution;
and that the act, instead of answering the purposes for
which it was intended, would serve only as a job to gra∣tify
the rapacious retainers to the government, and their
emissaries, in that country. After a warm debate, how∣ever,
it was adopted by a great majority, and obtained
the royal assent.</P>
<P>§ X. A third law related to certain articles of the
national debt, which were now converted into several
joint stocks of annuities, transferable at the Bank of
England, to be charged on the sinking-fund. A great
number of different funds for annuities, established at dif∣ferent
times, and by different acts, subsisted at this pe∣riod;
so that it was necessary to keep many different ac∣counts,
which could not be regulated without consider∣able
trouble and expense, for the removal of which the
bill was calculated.</P>
<P>§ XI. In consequence of petitions from the woollen
manufacturers of Westmorland and Yorkshire, two bills
were brought in, and passed through both Houses, by
which the ports of Lancaster and Great Yarmouth were
opened for the importation of wool and woollen yarn from
Ireland; but why this privilege was not extended to all
the frequented ports of the kingdom it is not easy to con∣ceive,
without supposing a little national jealousy on one
hand, and a great deal of grievous restraint on the other.
Over and above these new laws, some unsuccessful endea∣vours
were used in behalf of commerce and police. A
bill was offered for laying further restrictions on pawn∣brokers
and brokers, that they might no longer suck the
blood of the poor, and act as the accessaries of theft and
robbery, which was canvassed, debated, and made its
way through the Lower House; but the Lords rejected
it as a crude scheme, which they could not amend, be∣cause
it was a money-bill, not cognizable by their House,
without engaging in a dispute with the Commons. Ano∣ther
bill was prepared, for giving power to change the pu∣nishment
<PB N="308" REF="316"/>
of felony, in certain cases, to confinement and
hard labour in dock-yards or garrisons. It was the opi∣nion
of many who wished well to their country, and were
properly qualified to prosecute such enquiries, that the
practice of consigning such a number of wretches to the
hands of the executioner served only, by its frequency,
to defeat the purpose of the law, in robbing death of all
its terrour, and the publick of many subjects, who might,
notwithstanding their delinquency, be in some measure
rendered useful to society. Such was the motive that
influenced the promoters of this bill; by which it was
proposed, in imitation of that oeconomy practised in other
countries, to confine felons convicted under certain cir∣cumstances
to hard labour upon the publick works of
the kingdom. The scheme was adopted by the Lower
House, but rejected by the Lords, who seemed apprehen∣sive
of its bringing such discredit upon his Majesty's dock-yards
as would discourage persons who valued their repu∣tation
from engaging in such employment. Of still
greater importance to the nation was the next measure
proposed, in a bill for making the militia of England
more useful, presented by Mr. Thornton, a gentleman
of Yorkshire, who had distinguished himself by his loyalty
and patriotism. It was canvassed in a committee of the
whole House, and underwent divers amendments; but
miscarried, through the aversion of the ministry to any
project tending to remove or lessen the necessity of main∣taining
a standing army. A considerable number of peti∣tions
for different regulations, in respect to commerce and
convenience of traffick, were presented, considered, and
left upon the table. A remonstrance from the prisoners
confined in the jail of the King's-Bench, complaining
of their miserable situation, arising from want of room,
and other conveniences, being taken into consideration
by a committee, among other evidences, they examined
that remarkable personage who had signalized himself in
different parts of Christendom, under the name of Theo∣dore
King of Corsica. Though formerly countenanced,
<PB N="309" REF="317"/>
and even treated as a sovereign prince by the British
ministry, he was now reduced to the forlorn condition of
a confined debtor; and, to the reproach of this king∣dom,
died in prison, surrounded with all the misery of
indigence, and overwhelmed with the infirmities of old
age. But the most remarkable circumstance of the par∣liamentary
transactions that distinguished this session, was
a motion made in both Houses for an address to the King,
beseeching his Majesty, That in time of publick tran∣quillity
he would be graciously pleased to avoid entering
into subsidiary treaties with foreign princes, which are so
burthensome to this nation. This extraordinary propo∣sal
was made and strenuously urged by the Duke of B—,
and a vehement debate ensued, in which the Earls of G—,
S—, and H—, opposed it with an exertion of superior
abilities; and the question being put, was carried in the
negative, without a division. The same fate attended it
in the House of Commons, where it was introduced by
Lord H—y, and supported by some distinguished ora∣tors.
The session ended in the latter end of March, when
his Majesty, having given his assent to ninety-five publick
and private bills, harangued both Houses and prorogued
the parliament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among the proceedings of this session it may not be improper to men∣tion a new act for the prevention of murders, which had been shockingly frequent of late, importing, That every criminal convicted of this horrid crime should be executed in one day after his sentence, and his body deli∣vered to the surgeons for dissection—an expedient which hath been found productive of very salutary consequences.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>§ XII. Immediately after the prorogation the King
appointed a regency, and set out for Hanover, in order
to complete the great scheme he had projected for elect∣ing
a king of the Romans. Great-Britain, in the mean
time, produced no event of importance, or any transaction
that deserves historical mention, except the ratification of
two treaties of peace and commerce with the states of
Tripoli and Tunis on the coast of Barbary, concluded
by the British consuls in those cities, under the influence
and auspices of an English squadron, commanded by
<PB N="310" REF="318"/>
Commodore Keppel, son to the Earl of Albemarle. The
tide of luxury still flowed with an impetuous current,
bearing down all the mounds of temperance and deco∣rum;
while fraud and profligacy struck out new chan∣nels,
through which they eluded the restrictions of the
law, and all the vigilance of civil policy. New arts of
deception were invented, in order to ensnare and ruin the
unwary; and some infamous practices, in the way of
commerce, were countenanced by persons of rank and
importance in the commonwealth. A certain member of
parliament was obliged to withdraw himself from his
country, in consequence of a discovery, by which it ap∣peared
that he had contrived and executed schemes for de∣stroying
his own ships at sea, with a view to defraud the
insurers.</P>
<P>§ XIII. In the course of this year the affairs of the
continent did not undergo any material alteration. In
France the religious dispute concerning the doctrine of
Jansenius still subsisted between the clergy and the parlia∣ment;
and seemed to acquire additional fuel from the
violence of the Archbishop of Paris, a haughty turbulent
prelate, whose pride and bigotry were sufficient to embro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l
one half of Christendom. The northern powers enjoyed
a perfect tranquillity: the States-General of the United
Provinces were engrossed by plans of national oeconomy.
Spain was intent upon extending her commerce, bringing
her manufactures to perfection, and repressing the insolence
of the Barbary Corsairs. His Portuguese<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Majesty endea∣voured,
by certain peremptory precautions, to check the
exportation of gold coin from his dominions; and insisted
upon inspecting the books of the British merchants settled
at Lisbon; but they refused to comply with this demand,
which was contrary to a treaty subsisting between the two
crowns; and he thought proper to acquies<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in their re∣fusal.
He was much better employed in obtaining from
the Pope an abolition of the annual procession called the
<HI>Auto da fe,</HI> one of the most horrid triumphs of spiritual
tyranny. The peace of Italy was secured by a defensive
<PB N="311" REF="319"/>
treaty concluded at Madrid between the Emperor, his
Catholick Majesty, the King of the Two Sicilies, and the
Duke of Parma; to which treaty the King of Sardinia
afterwards acceded.</P>
<P>§ XIV. With respect to the great scheme of electing
the Archduke Joseph king of the Romans, fresh objec∣tions
seemed to rise from different quarters. The good
understanding between the courts of Berlin and Hanover
received an additional shock, from a dispute concerning
the property of East Frieseland, which his Prussian Ma∣jesty,
had secured, as heir to the last possessor. His Bri∣tannick
Majesty, as Elector of Hanover, having pretensions
to the same inheritance, his minister delivered a memorial
to the diet of the Empire, assembled at Ratisbon, demand∣ing
that the King of Prussia, as Elector of Brandenburgh,
should be referred to the decision of the Aulick council, in
regard to his claim to the estates of East Frieseland: but the
King being already in possession, refused to submit his
right to the determination of that or any other tribunal;
and when the diet presumed to deliberate on this affair,
his envoy entered a strong protest against their proceed∣ings.
At the same time, he presented the other ministers
with a memorial, tending to refute the Elector of Ha∣nover's
pretensions to the principality in question.</P>
<P>§ XV. At this juncture his Prussian Majesty made no
scruple of expressing his resentment against the court of
London, which he seemed to consider as an officious cabal,
that had no right to intermeddle in the affairs of Germany.
His resident at London complained to the British ministry,
that divers ships, sailing under the Prussian flag, had been
stopped at sea, and even seised, by English cruisers; and
that his subjects had been ill-treated and oppressed: he,
therefore, demanded reparation in a peremptory tone;
and, in the mean time, discontinued the payment of the
Silesia loan, which he had charged himself with, by an
article in the treaty of Breslau. This was a sum of money
amounting to two hundred and fifty thousand pounds,
which the Emperor Charles VI. father of the reigning
<PB N="312" REF="320"/>
Empress, had borrowed of the subjects of Great-Britain,
on condition of paying an interest of six per cent. and
mortgaging the silver mines of Silesia for the repayment
of the principal. These devolved to the King of Prussia
with this incumbrance, and he continued to pay the in∣terest
punctually till this juncture, when the payment was
stopped; and he published a paper, intituled, “An Exposi∣tion
of the Motives which influenced his Conduct on this
Occasion.” In his memorial to the ministry of Great-Britain
he alledged, That eighteen Prussian ships, and
thirty-three neutral vessels, in which the subjects of Prus∣sia
were concerned, had been unjustly seised by English
privateers: his account of damages amounted to a very
considerable sum; and he demanded, in the most dogmatick
terms, that the affair should be finally discussed in the
term of three months from the date of his remonstrance.
The exposition and memorial were subjected to the exa∣mination
of the ablest civilians in England, who refuted
every article of the charge with equal precision and per∣spicuity.
They proved, that captures by sea fell properly
under the cognizance of those powers under whose juris∣diction
the seisures were made; and, therefore, his Prus∣sian
Majesty could not, consistent with the law of nations,
determine these disputes in his own tribunals. They de∣monstrated,
by undoubted evidence, the falsity of many
facts alledged in the memorial, as well as the fairness of
the proceedings by which some few of the Prussian ves∣sels
had been condemned; and made it apear, that no
insult or injury had been offered to the subjects of Prussia.
Finally, they observed, that the Silesia loan was a private
transaction of such a nature, that, even if a war had hap∣pened
between the Emperor Charles VI. and his Britan∣nick
Majesty, this must have been held sacred and invio∣lable:
that when the Empress-Queen ceded Silesia to the
King of Prussia, this monarch charged himself with the
repayment of the loan, which, being a private debt, and
transferable, was now diffused into different countries,
and become the property of many others besides the sub∣jects
<PB N="313" REF="321"/>
of Great-Britain. They wound up their chain of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>easoning by observing, that, according to agreement
with the Emperor, the whole of this loan should have
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een repayed in the year one thousand seven hundred and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orty-five; whereas the complaints specified in the Prussian
memorial were founded on facts posterior to that period.
Whether his Prussian Majesty was convinced by these
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>asons, and desisted from principle, or thought proper to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive up his claim upon other political considerations;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ertain it is, he no longer insisted upon satisfaction, but
ordered the payments of the Silesia loan to be continued
without further interruption: a report, indeed, was cir∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulated,
that advantage had been taken of the demur by a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ertain prince, who employed his agents to buy up great
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>art of the loan at a considerable discount.</P>
<P>§ XVI. How much soever the King of Prussia may be
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> subject of censure on this occasion, it must be allowed
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at, with regard to his own subjects, he acted as a wise
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gislator, and the father of his country. He peopled the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eserts of Pomerania, by encouraging, with royal boun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es,
a great number of industrious emigrants to settle in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at province; the face of which, in a very few years,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nderwent the most agreeable alteration. Above sixty
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew villages arose amidst a barren waste, and every part
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the country exhibited marks of successful cultivation.
Those solitary and desolate plains, where no human foot∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eps
had for many ages been seen, were now converted into
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elds of corn. The farms were regularly farmed out: the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouses multiplied, and teemed with population: the happy
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>easants, sheltered in a peculiar manner under their king's
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rotection, sowed their grounds in peace, and reaped
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir harvests in security. The same care and indulgence
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere extended to the unpeopled parts of other provinces
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ithin the Prussian dominions, and extraordinary en∣couragement
was granted to all French protestants who
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould come and settle under the government of this politi∣cal
sage.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="322"/>
§ XVII. The courts of Vienna and Hanover still em∣ployed
their chief attention upon the scheme of electing a
king of the Romans; and the Elector of Mentz, in∣fluenced
by the majority of the college, had convoked an
electoral diet for that purpose: but strong protests against
this convocation were entered by the Electors of Cologn
and Palatine, insomuch that it was thought expedient to
conciliate this last, by taking some steps in his favour, with
respect to the satisfaction he demanded from the Empress-Queen
and his Britannick Majesty. His claim upon the
court of Vienna amounted to three millions of florins, by
way of indemnification for the losses he had sustained during
the war. He demanded of the King of England twenty
thousand pounds sterling, for provision and forage furnished
to the British troops while they acted on the Maine; and
the like sum for the like purposes from the States-General
of the United Provinces. The Empress-Queen could not
help remonstrating against this demand as exorbitant in
itself, and the more unreasonable, as the Elector Palatine,
at the death of her father, had openly declared against the
pragmatick sanction, which he had guaranteed in the most
solemn manner: she, therefore, observed that the damage
he had sustained, in consequence of that declaration, ought
to be considered as the common fate of war. These rea∣sons,
though conclusive and irrefragable in the usual way
of arguing, made no impression upon the Palatine, who
perfectly well understood his own importance, and was de∣termined
to seise this opportunity of turning it to the best
advantage. The court of Vienna, and the Maritime
Powers, finding him thus obstinately attached to his own
interest, resolved to bring him over to their views at any
rate, and commenced a negociation with him, which pro∣duced
a formal treaty. By this convention his demands
in money were fixed at twelve hundred thousand Dutch
storms, to be paid at three instalments, five hundred thou∣sand
by the Empress-Queen, and the remaining seven
hundred thousand by the King of Great-Britain and the
States-General, according to the proportion established in
<PB N="315" REF="323"/>
former treaties. The privilege of <HI>Non appellendo,</HI> for the
duchy of Deux-ponts, was confirmed to his electoral
highness, together with some other rights and pretensions,
in consideration of his concurring with the other electors
in the choice of a king of the Romans, to be elected ac∣cording
to the customs prescribed by the laws and consti∣tutions
of the Empire. He likewise engaged to join them
in settling the articles of the capitulation with the King of
the Romans, emperor <HI>in futuro.</HI> Yet, even after the
concurrence of this prince was secured, the purposed
election proved abortive, from the strong objections that
were started, and the strenuous opposition which was made
by his Prussian Majesty, who perhaps aspired in secret at
the Imperial dignity, which the Empress-Queen took all
this pains to perpetuate in her own family.</P>
<P>§ XVIII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> The King of Great-Britain, returning from
the continent, opened the session of parliament on the
eleventh day of January with a speech, implying, That
all his views and negociations had been calculated and di∣rected
to preserve and secure the duration of the general
peace, so agreeable and necessary to the welfare of all
Europe: That he had the satisfaction to be assured of a
good disposition in all the powers that were his allies, to
adhere to the same salutary object. He exhorted them to
continue their attention to the reduction of the national
debt, the augmentation of the sinking fund, and the im∣provement
of the publick revenue. He recommended
to their serious consideration what further laws and regu∣lations
might be necessary for suppressing those crimes and
disorders, of which the publick had so justly complained:
and concluded with an assurance, that his hearty con∣currence
and endeavours should never be wanting in any
measure that might promote their welfare and prosperity.
The addresses in answer to this speech were couched in
the usual form of implicit approbation: but that of the
Commons did not pass without question. The Earl of
E—took exceptions to one paragraph, in which they
acknowledged his Majesty's wisdom, as well as goodness,
<PB N="316" REF="324"/>
in pursuing such measures as must contribute to maintain and
render permanent the general tranquillity of Europe;<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1753.</NOTE> and
declared their satisfaction at the assurances his Majesty had
received from his allies, that they were all attached to the
same salutary object. His lordship expatiated on the ab∣surdity
of these compliments at such a juncture, when the
peace of Europe was so precarious, and the English nation
had so much cause of complaint and dissatisfaction. He
was seconded by some other individuals, who declaimed
with great vivacity against continental connexions; and
endeavoured to expose the weakness and folly of the whole
system of foreign measures which our ministry had lately
pursued. It must be owned, indeed, that they might
have chosen a better opportunity to compliment their
sovereign on the permanency of the peace than at this
juncture, when they must have seen themselves on the very
brink of a new rupture with the most formidable power in
Europe. But the truth is, these addresses to the throne
had been long considered as compliments of course, im∣plying
no more than a respectful attachment to their
sovereign: accordingly, both Houses agreed to their re∣spective
addresses without division. The two grand com∣mittees
of supply and of ways and means being established,
the business of the House was transacted without much
altercation; and the people had great reason to be satisfi∣ed
with their moderate proceedings. Ten thousand sea∣men,
and the usual number of land-forces, were retained
for the service of the ensuing year. They provided for
the maintenance of the new colony in Nova-Scotia, the
civil establishment of Georgia, the support of the castles
on the coast of Guinea, and the erection of a new fort
at Anamaboa, where the French had attempted to make
a settlement; and they enabled his Majesty to fulfil his
engagements with the King of Poland and the Elector
of Bavaria.</P>
<P>§ XIX. The supplies, including grants for former de∣ficiencies
and services, for which no provision had been
made in the course of the last year, did not exceed two
<PB N="317" REF="325"/>
millions one hundred thirty-two thousand seven hundred
and seven pounds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. II. 1753.</NOTE> seventeen shillings, and two-pence
half-penny; in order to defray which expense they assign∣ed
the duty on malt, &amp;c. the land-tax at two shillings in
the pound, the surplus of certain funds in the Exchequer,
and the sum of four hundred and twenty thousand pounds
out of the sinking fund; so that the exceedings amounted
to near three hundred thousand pounds<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Several duties on salt, as well as on red and white herrings delivered out for home consumption, were rendered perpetual, though subject to be redeemed by parliament; and it was provided, that the debt contracted upon these duties being discharged, all the after produce of them should become part of the sinking fund.</NOTE>. As for the
national debt, it now stood at the enormous sum of seven∣ty-four
millions three hundred sixty-eight thousand four
hundred and fifty-one pounds, fifteen shillings, and one
penny; and the sinking fund produced one million seven
hundred thirty-five thousand five hundred and twenty-nine
pounds, six shillings, and ten-pence farthing.</P>
<P>§ XX. One of the first measures brought upon the
carpet, in the course of this session, was an act containing
regulations for the better preservation of the game, of
which so great havock had been made by poachers, and
other persons unqualified to enjoy that diversion, that the
total extirpation of it was apprehended.</P>
<P>§ XXI. The next step taken by the Commons was an
affair of much greater consequence to the community,
being a bill for obliging ships the more effectually to per∣form
quarantine, in order to prevent the plague from
being imported from foreign countries into Great-Britain.
For this purpose, it was ordained, that if this dreadful
visitation should appear in any ship to the northward of
Cape Finisterre, the master or commander should imme∣diately
proceed to the harbour of New Grimsby, in one of
the islands o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Scilly, and there communicate the discovery
to some officer of the Customs; who should, with the
first opportunity, transmit this intelligence to another
Custom-house officer in the nearest port of England, to
<PB N="318" REF="326"/>
be by him forwarded to one of his Majesty's principal
secretaries of state. In the mean time the ship should re∣main
at the said island, and not an individual presume to
go ashore, until his Majesty's pleasure should be known
It was also provided, that in case the master of a ship
thus infected should not be able to make the islands of
Scilly, or be forced up either channel by violent winds
he should not enter any frequented harbour; but remain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in some open road, until he could receive orders from his<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Majesty, or the privy-council: that, during this interval▪
he should avoid all intercourse with the shore, or any
person or vessel whatsoever, on pain of being deemed guil∣ty
of felony, and suffering death without benefit of clergy.</P>
<P>§ XXII. In order the more effectually to repress the
barbarous practice of plundering ships which have the
misfortune to suffer shipwreck; a practice which prevaile<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
upon many different parts of the British coast, to the dis∣grace
of the nation, and the scandal of human nature; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
bill was prepared, containing clauses to enforce the law<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
against such savage delinquents, who prowl along
the shore, like hungry wolves, in hopes of preying upon
their fellow-creatures; and certain provisions for the re∣lief
of the unhappy sufferers<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">By this new law, the clerk of the peace in the county where the crim shall be committed is obliged, upon receiving proper information, to pro∣secute the offenders at the expense of the country. It was likewise proposed that in case no prosecution of this nature should be commenced within▪ certain limited time after the information should have been legally given, in that case the county might be sued by the person who had sustained the damage, and obliged to indemnify him for his loss: but this clause was rejected by the majority; and the bill, having made its way through both Houses, received the royal assent.</NOTE>. When the mutiny-bil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
fell under deliberation, the Earl of Egmont propose<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

was disapproved by the majority, and this annual bill wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

§ XXIII. The next bill was framed in consequence of
divers petitions presented by the exporters of corn, who
complained that the bounties were not paid, and prayed
that the House would make proper provision for that pur∣pose.
A bill was accordingly brought in, importing,
That interest after the rate of three per cent. should be
allowed upon every debenture for the bounty on the ex∣portation
of corn, payable by the receiver-general or ca∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ier
of the Customs, until the principal could be discharged
out of such Customs or duties as are appropriated for the
payment of this bounty. This premium on the exportation
of corn ought not to be granted, except when the lowness
of the market-price in Great-Britain proves that there is a
superabundance in the kingdom; otherwise the exporter
will find his account in depriving our own labourers of
their bread, in order to supply our rivals at an easier rate:
for example, suppose wheat in England should sell for
twenty shillings a quarter, the merchant might export it to
France, and afford it to the people of that kingdom for
eighteen shillings, because the bounty on exportation
would, even at that rate, afford him a considerable ad∣vantage.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. A great number of merchants having present∣ed
petitions from different parts of the kingdom, represent∣ing
that the trade to Turkey was greatly decreased, ascrib∣ing
this diminution to the exclusive charter enjoyed by a
monopoly, and praying that the trade might be laid open
to all his Majesty's subjects, one of the members for Liver∣pool
moved for leave to bring in a bill for this purpose.
Such a measure had been twice before proposed without
success; but now it was adopted without opposition. A
bill was immediately introduced; and, notwithstanding all
the interest and efforts of the Turkey company, who pe∣titioned
the House against it, and were heard by their coun∣sel,
it passed through both Houses, and received the royal
sanction. By this regulation any British subject may ob∣tain
the freedom of the Turkey company, by paying or
tendering a fine of twenty pounds; and all the members
<PB N="320" REF="328"/>
are secured from the tyranny of oppressive by-laws, con∣trived
by any monopolizing cabal<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Several other bills were passed—one for regulating the number of public-houses, and the more easy conviction of persons selling ale and strong li∣quors without license; an act which empowered the justices of peace to tyrannise over their fellow subjects—a second, enabling the magistrates of Edinburgh to improve, enlarge, and adorn the avenues and streets of that city, according to a concerted plan, to be executed by voluntary subscrip∣tion—a third, allowing the exportation of wool and woollen yarn from Ireland into any port in Great Britain—and a fourth, prescribing the breadth of the wheels belonging to heavy carriages, that the high roads of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> kingdom might be the bette<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eserved.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>§ XXV. But this session was chiefly distinguished by
an act for naturalizing Jews, and a bill for the better pre∣venting
clandestine marriages. The first of these, which
passed without much opposition in the House of Lords,
from whence it descended to the Commons, was intituled,
“An Act to permit Persons professing the Jewish Religion
to be naturalized by Parliament, and for other Purposes
therein mentioned.” It was supported by some petitions
of merchants and manufacturers, who, upon examination,
appeared to be Jews, or their dependants; and counte∣nanced
by the ministry, who thought they foresaw, in the
consequences of such a naturalization, a great accession to
the moneyed interest, and a considerable increase of their
own influence among the individuals of that community.
They boldly affirmed, that such a law would greatly con∣duce
to the advantage of the nation; that it would
encourage persons of wealth to remove with their ef∣fects
from foreign parts into Great-Britain, increase the
commerce and the credit of the kingdom, and set a lauda∣ble
example of industry, temperance, and frugality. Such,
however, were not the sentiments of the Lord-Mayor,
aldermen, and commons of the city of London in common-council
assembled, who, in a petition to parliament, ex∣pressed
their apprehension that the bill, if passed into a law,
would tend greatly to the dishonour of the christian religion,
endanger the excellent constitution, and be highly preju∣dicial
to the interest and trade of the kingdom in general,
and of the city of London in particular. Another petition
<PB N="321" REF="329"/>
to the same purpose was next day presented to the House,
subscribed by merchants and traders of the city of London;
who, among other allegations, observed, that the conse∣quences
of such a naturalization would greatly affect their
trade and commerce with foreign nations, particularly
with Spain and Portugal. Counsel was heard, evidence
examined, and the bill produced violent debates, in which
there seemed to be more passion than patriotism, more de∣clamation
than argument. The adversaries of the bill af∣firmed,
that such a naturalization would deluge the king∣dom
with brokers, usurers, and beggars; that the rich Jews,
under the shadow of this indulgence, would purchase lands,
and even advowsons; so as not only to acquire an interest
in the legislature, but also to influence the constitution of
the church of Christ, to which they were the inveterate and
professed enemies: that the lower class of that nation,
when thus admitted to the right of denizens, would inter∣fere
with the industrious natives who earn their livelihood
by their labour; and by dint of the most parsimonious fru∣gality,
to which the English are strangers, work at an
under-price; so as not only to share, but even in a man∣ner
to exclude them from all employment: that such an
adoption of vagrant Jews into the community, from all
parts of the world, would rob the real subjects of their
birthright, disgrace the character of the nation, expose
themselves to the most dishonourable participation and in∣trusion,
endanger the constitution both in church and state,
and be an indelible reproach upon the established religion
of the country. Some of these orators seemed transported
even to a degree of enthusiasm. They prognosticated that
the Jews would multiply so much in number, engross
such wealth, and acquire so great power and influence in
Great-Britain, that their persons would be revered, their
customs imitated, and Judaism become the fashionable re∣ligion
of the English. Finally, they affirmed that such an act
was directly flying in the face of the prophesy, which de∣clares,
that the Jews shall be a scattered people, without coun∣try
or fixed habitation, until they shall be converted from their
<PB N="322" REF="330"/>
infidelity, and gathered together in the land of their fore∣fathers.
These arguments and apprehensions, which were
in reality frivolous and chimerical, being industriously cir∣culated
among the vulgar, naturally prejudiced against the
Jewish people, excited such a ferment throughout the na∣tion,
as ought to have deterred the minister from the prose∣cution
of such an unpopular measure; which, however,
they had courage enough to maintain against all opposition.
The bill passed the ordeal of both Houses, and his Majesty
vouchsafed the royal sanction to this law in favour of the
Hebrew nation. The truth is, it might have increased the
wealth, and extended the commerce of Great-Britain, had
it been agreeable to the people; and as the naturalized
Jews would still have been excluded from all civil and
military offices, as well as from other privileges enjoyed
by their Christian brethren, in all probability they would
have gradually forsaken their own unprofitable and obsti∣nate
infidelity, opened their eyes to the shining truths of
the gospel, and joined their fellow-subjects in embracing
the doctrines of Christianity. But no ministry ought to
risk an experiment, how plausible soever it may be, if they
find it, as this was, an object of the people's unconquerable
aversion. What rendered this unpopular measure the
more impolitick, was the unseasonable juncture at which
it was carried into execution; that is, at the eve of a ge∣neral
election for a new parliament, when a minister ought
carefully to avoid every step which may give umbrage to
the body of the people. The Earl of Eg—t, who ar∣gued
against the bill with equal power and vivacity, in de∣scribing
the effect it might have upon that occasion, “I
am amazed (said he) that this consideration makes no
impression.—When that day, which is not far off, shall
arrive, I shall not fear to set my foot upon any ground
of election in the kingdom, in opposition to any one man
among you, or any new Christian, who has voted or ap∣peared
in savour of this naturalization.”</P>
<P>§ XXVI. Another bill, transmitted from the Upper
House, met with a reception equally unfavourable among
<PB N="323" REF="331"/>
the Commons, though it was sustained on the shoulders of
the majority, and thus forced its way to the throne, where
it obtained the royal approbation. The practice of solemn∣ising
clandestine marriages, so prejudicial to the peace of
families, and so often productive of misery to the parties
themselves thus united, was an evil that prevailed to such
a degree as claimed the attention of the legislature. The
sons and daughters of great and opulent families, before
they had acquired knowledge and experience, or attained
to the years of discretion, were every day seduced in their
affections, and inveigled into matches big with infamy
and ruin; and these were greatly facilitated by the oppor∣tunities
that occurred of being united instantaneously by
the ceremony of marriage, in the first transport of passion,
before the destined victim had time to cool or deliberate on
the subject. For this pernicious purpose, there was a band of
profligate miscreants, the refuse of the clergy, dead to every
sentiment of virtue, abandoned to all sense of decency and
decorum, for the most part prisoners for debt or delinquen∣cy,
and indeed the very outcasts of human society, who
hovered about the verge of the Fleet-prison to intercept cus∣tomers,
plying like porters for employment, and performed
the ceremony of marriage without license or question, in
cellars, garrets, or alehouses, to the scandal of religion, and
the disgrace of that order which they professed. The ease
with which this ecclesiastical sanction was obtained, and
the vicious disposition of those wretches, open to the
practices of fraud and corruption, were productive of po∣lygamy,
indigence, conjugal infidelity, prostitution, and
every curse that could embitter the married state. A re∣markable
case of this nature having fallen under the cogni∣zance
of the Peers, in an appeal from an inferior tribunal,
that House ordered the judges to prepare a new bill for pre∣venting
such abuses; and one was accordingly framed,
under the auspices of Lord Hardwicke, at that time lord high
chancellor of England. In order to anticipate the bad
effects of clandestine marriages, this new statute enacted,
That the banns should be regularly published, three suc∣cessive
<PB N="324" REF="332"/>
Sundays, in the church of the parish where the par∣ties
dwell: That no license should be granted to marry in
any place, where one of the parties has not dwelt at least a
month, except a special license by the Archbishop: That
if any marriage should be solemnised in any other place
than a church or a chapel, without a special license, or
in a publick chapel, without having published the banns, or
obtained a license of some person properly qualified, the
marriage should be void, and the person who solemnised it
transported for seven years: That marriages, by license, by
parties under age, without consent of parent or guardian,
should be null and void, unless the party under age be a
widow, and the parent refusing consent a widow married
again: That when the consent of a mother or guardian is
refused from caprice, or such parent or guardian be <HI>non
compos mentis,</HI> or beyond <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea, the minor should have recourse
for relief to the court of Chancery: That no suit should
be commenced to compel a celebration of marriages, upon
pretence of any contract: That all marriages should be
solemnised before two witnesses, and an entry be made in
a book kept for that purpose, whether it was by banns or
license, whether either of the parties was under age, or the
marriage celebrated with the consent of parent or guardian;
and this entry to be signed by the minister, the parties,
and the witnesses: That a false license or certificate, or de∣stroying
register books, should be deemed felony, either in
principal or accessary, and punished with death. The bill
when first considered in the Lower House, gave rise to a
variety of debates; in which the members appeared to be
divided rather according to their real sentiments, than by
the rules of any political di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tinction: for some principal
servants of the government freely differed in opinion from
the minister, who countenanced the bill; while, on the
other hand, he was, on this occasion, supported by certain
chiefs of the opposition, and the disputes were maintained
with extraordinary eagerness and warmth. The princi∣pal
objections imported, that such restrictions on marriage
would damp the spirit of love and propagation; promote
<PB N="325" REF="333"/>
mercenary matches, to the ruin of domestick happiness, as
well as to the prejudice of posterity and population; im∣pede
the circulation of property, by preserving the wealth
of the kingdom among a kind of aristocracy of opulent
families, who would always intermarry within their own
pale; subject the poor to many inconveniencies, and extra∣ordinary
expense, from the nature of the forms to be ob∣served;
and throw an additional power into the hands of
the chancellor. They affirmed, that no human power
had a right to dissolve a vow solemnly made in the sight of
heaven: and that, in proportion as the bill prevented
clandestine marriages, it would encourage fornication and
debau<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hery, inasmuch as the parties, restrained from in∣dulging
their mutual passions in an honourable manner,
would be tempted to gratify them by stealth, at the ha∣zard
of their reputation. In a word they foresaw a great
number of evils in the train of this bill, which have not
yet been realised. On the other side, its advocates en∣deavoured
to refute these arguments, and some of them
spoke with great strength and precision. The bill under∣went
a great number of alterations and amendments, which
were not effected without violent contest and altercation.
At length, however, it was floated through both Houses
on the tide of a great majority, and steered into the safe
harbour of royal approbation. Certain it is, the abuse of
clandestine marriage might have been removed upon much
easier terms than those imposed upon the subject by this
bill, which, after all, hath been found ineffectual, as it may
be easily eluded by a short voyage to the continent, or a
moderate journey to North-Britain, where the indissoluble
knot may be tied without scruple or interruption.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. Over and above these new statutes there were
some other subjects which occasionally employed the at∣tention
of the Commons; such as the state of the British
sugar colonies, which was considered, in consequence of
petitions presented by the sugar-refiners and grocers of
London, Westminster, and Bristol, complaining of the
exorbitant price demanded and given for sugars imported
<PB N="326" REF="334"/>
from Jamaica; desiring that the proprietors of land in
Jamaica might be obliged to cultivate greater quantities of
ground for raising sugar canes, or that they (the petitioners)
might have leave to import muscovado sugars from other
countries, when the price of those imported from Jamaica
should exceed a certain rate. This remonstrance was
taken into consideration by a committee of the whole
House; and a great number of evidences and papers being
examined, they resolved, That the peopling of Jamaica
with white inhabitants, and cultivating the lands thereof,
would be the most proper measure for securing that island,
and increasing the trade and navigation between it and
Great-Britain, and other parts of his Majesty's dominions:
That the endeavours hitherto used by the legislature of Ja∣maica
to increase the number of white inhabitants, and en∣force
the cultivation of lands, in the manner that might
best conduce to the security and defence of that island, had
not been effectual for these purposes. The House ordered
a bill to be founded on these resolutions; but this was
postponed, until the ministry should receive more full in∣formation
touching the true state of that island. The
planters of Jamaica laboured under many grievances and
hardships, from divers heavy impositions and restrictions;
and a detail of these was transmitted in a representation to
his Majesty, which was referred to the consideration of the
commissioners of trade and plantations. The cause of the
planters was defended vigorously, and managed in the
House of Commons by Alderman Beckford, a gentleman
of vast possessions in the island of Jamaica, who perfectly
well understood, and strenuously supported, the interest o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
that his native country.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. Abortive also proved the attempt to establish
a law, for keeping an annual register of marriages, births,
deaths, the individuals who received alms, and the total
number of people in Great-Britain. A bill for this pur∣pose
was presented by Mr. Potter, a gentleman of pregnant
parts and spirited elocution, who, enumerating the advan∣tages
of such a law, observed, that it would ascertain the
<PB N="327" REF="335"/>
number of the people, and the collective strength of the
nation; consequently point out those places where there is
a defect or excess of population, and certainly determine
whether a general naturalization would be advantageous
or prejudicial to the community; that it would decide what
number of men might, on any sudden emergency, be le∣vied
for the defence of the kingdom; and whether the na∣tion
is gainer or loser by sending its natives to settle, and
our troops to defend distant colonies; that it would be the
means of establishing a local administration of civil govern∣ment,
or a police upon certain fixed principles, the want
of which hath been long a reproach to the nation, a securi∣ty
to vice, and an encouragement to idleness; that in ma∣ny
cases, where all other evidence is wanting, it would
enable suitors to recover their right in courts of justice, fa∣cilitate
an equal and equitable assessment in raising the
present taxes, and laying future impositions; specify the
lineal descents, relations, and alliances of families; lighten
the intolerable burthens incurred by the publick, from in∣numerable
and absurd regulations relating to the poor;
provide for them by a more equal exertion of humanity,
and effectually screen them from all risque of perishing by
hunger, cold, cruelty, and oppression. Whether such a
law would have answered the sanguine expectations of its
patron, we shall not pretend to determine; though, in our
opinion, it must have been attended with very salutary con∣sequences,
particularly in restraining the hand of robbery
and violence, in detecting fraud, bridling the ferocity of a
licentious people, and establishing a happy system of order
and subordination. At first the bill met with little oppo∣sition,
except from Mr. Thornton, member for the city of
York, who inveighed against it with great fervour, as a
measure that favoured of French policy, to which the Eng∣lish
nation ever had the utmost aversion. He affirmed,
that the method in which it was proposed this register
should be kept would furnish the enemies of Great-Britain
with continual opportunities of knowing the strength or
weakness of the nation; that it would empower an ill-de∣signing
<PB N="328" REF="336"/>
minister to execute any scheme subversive of pub∣lick
liberty, invest parish and petty officers of the peace with
exorbitant powers, and cost the nation above fifty thousand
pounds a-year to carry the scheme into execution. These
arguments, which, we apprehend, are extremely frivolous
and inconclusive, had great weight with a considerable
number, who joined in the opposition, while the ministry
stood neutral. Nevertheless, after having undergone some
amendments, it was conveyed to the Lords, by whom it
was, at the second reading, thrown out, as a scheme of a
very dangerous tendency. The legislature of Great-Britain
have, on some occasions, been more startled at the distant
shadow of a bare possibility, than at the real approach of
the most dangerous innovation.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. From the usual deliberations on civil and
commercial concerns, the attention of the parliament,
which had seldom or never turned upon literary avocations,
was called off by an extraordinary subject of this nature.
Sir Hans Sloane, the celebrated physician and naturalist,
well known through all the civilised countries of Europe
for his ample collection of rarities, culled from the animal,
vegetable, and mineral kingdoms, as well as of antiquities
and curiosities of art, had directed, in his last will, that
this valuable museum, together with his numerous library,
should be offered to the parliament, for the use of the pub∣lick,
in consideration of their paying a certain sum, in com∣pensation,
to his heirs. His terms were embraced by the
Commons, who agreed to pay twenty thousand pounds for
the whole, supposed to be worth four times that sum; and
a bill was prepared for purchasing this museum, together
with the Harleian collection of manuscripts, so denominated
from its founder, Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, lord
high treasurer of England, and now offered to the pub∣lick
by his daughter, the Duchess of Portland. It was
proposed, that these purchases should be joined to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣mous
Cottonian library, and a suitable repository provided
for them and the king's library, which had long lain ne∣glected,
and exposed to the injuries of the weather in the
<PB N="329" REF="337"/>
old dormitory at Westminster. Accordingly, trustees and
governors, consisting of the most eminent persons of the
kingdom, were appointed, and regulations established for
the management of this noble museum, which was de∣posited
in Montagu-House, one of the most magnifi∣cent
edifices in England, where it is subjected without
reserve to the view of the publick, under certain neces∣sary
restrictions, and exhibits a glorious monument of
national taste and liberality.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The library of Sir Hans Sloane consisted of above fifty thousand volumes, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>-luding about three hundred and fifty books of drawings, and three thousand five hundred and sixteen manuscripts, besides a multitude of prints. The museum comprehended an infinite number of medals, coins, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rns, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, seals, cam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>os, intaglios, precious stones vessels of agate and jasper, chrysts, spars, fossile, metals, minerals, ores, earths, sands, salts, bitumens, sulphur amber, ambergrise, tal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, mirae, testacea, cor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls, sponges, echini, echenite<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teriae, trochi, crustatia, st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llae marinae, fishes, birds, eggs, and nests, vips, serpents, quadrupeds, insects, human calculi, anatomical pre∣parations, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds, gums, roots, dried plants, pictures, drawings, and mathe∣matical inst<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ments.

the session of parliament was closed by his Majesty, who
mentioned nothing particular in his speech, but that the
state of foreign affairs had suffered no alteration since their
meeting.</P>
<P>§ XXX. The genius of the English people is perhaps
incompatible with a state of perfect tranquillity: if it is
not ruffled by foreign provocations, or agitated by unpo∣pular
measures of domestick administration, it will
undergo temporary fermentations from the turbulent in∣gredients
inherent in its own constitution. Tumults are
excited, and factions kindled into rage and inveteracy,
by incidents of the most frivolous nature. At this junc∣ture
the metropolis of England was divided and discom∣posed
in a surprising manner, by a dispute in itself of so
little consequence to the community, that it could not
deserve a place in a general history, if it did not serve to
convey a characteristick idea of the English nation. In
the beginning of the year an obscure damsel, of low
degree, whose name was Elisabeth Canning, promulgated
a report, which in a little time attracted the attention
<PB N="330" REF="338"/>
of the publick. She affirmed, that on the first day of
the new year, at night, she was seised under Bedlam∣wall
by two ruffians, who having stripped her of her up∣per
apparel, secured her mouth with a gag, and threatened
to murther her should she make the least noise; that they
conveyed her on foot about ten miles, to a place called
Endfield-wash, and brought her to the house of one Mrs.
Wells, where she was pillaged of her stays; and, because
she refused to turn prostitute, confined in a cold, damp,
separate, and unfurnished apartment; where she remain∣ed
a whole month, without any other sustenance than
a few stale crusts of bread, and about a gallon of water;
till at length she forced her way through a window, and
ran home to her mother's house, almost naked, in the
night of the twenty-ninth of January. This story, im∣probable
and unsupported, operated so strongly on the
passions of the people in the neighbourhood of Alderman∣bury,
where Canning's mother lived, and particularly
among fanaticks of all denominations, that they raise<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
voluntary contributions, with surprising eagerness, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
order to bring the supposed delinquents to justice. War∣rants
were granted for apprehending Wells, who kep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the house at Endfield-wash, and her accomplices, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
servant-maid, whose name was Virtue Hall, and on<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Squires, an old gipsey-woman, which last was charge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
by Canning with having robbed her of her stays. Wells
though acquitted of the felony, was punished as a baw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

Squires, the gipsey, was convicted of the rob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bery,
though she produced undoubted evidence to prove
that she was at Abbotsbury in Dorsetshire that very nig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

the common people in her favour had risen to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
pitch of enthusiasm, that the most palpable truth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which

of exasperating them to the most dangerous <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egree of
rage and revenge. Some of the witnesses <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Squires,
<PB N="331" REF="339"/>
though persons of unblemished character, were so inti∣midated
that they durst not enter the court; and those
who had resolution enough to give evidence in her behalf,
ran the risque of assassination from the vulgar that sur∣rounded
the place. On this occasion, Sir Crisp Gas∣coyne,
lord-mayor of London, behaved with that laud∣able
courage and humanity which ought ever to distin∣guish
the chief magistrate of such a metropolis. Consi∣dering
the improbability of the charge, the heat, par∣tiality,
and blind enthusiasm with which it was prosecuted,
and being convinced of the old woman's innocence by a
great number of affidavits, voluntarily sent up from the
country by persons of unquestionable credit, he, in con∣junction
with some other worthy citizens, resolved to
oppose the torrent of vulgar prejudice. Application was
made to the throne for mercy: the case was referred to
the Attorney and Sollicitor-General, who, having exa∣mined
the evidences on both sides, made their report in
favour of Squires to the King and council; and this poor
old creature was indulged with his Majesty's pardon.
This affair was now swelled up into such a faction as
divided the greater part of the kingdom, including the
rich as well as the poor, the high as well as the humble.
Pamphlets and pasquinades were published on both sides
of the dispute, which became the general topick of con∣versation
in all assemblies, and people of all ranks espoused
one or other party with as much warmth and animosity
as had ever inflamed the Whigs and Tories, even at the
most rancorous period of their opposition. Subscriptions
were opened, and large sums levied, on one side, to pro∣secute
for perjury the persons on whose evidence the par∣don
had been granted. On the other hand, those who
had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terested themselves for the gipsey resolved to sup∣port
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> witnesses, and, if possible, detect the imposture
of Can<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng. Bills of perjury were preferred on both
sides. T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e evidences for Squires were tried and acquitted:
at first Canning absconded; but afterwards surrendered
to take her trial, and being after a long hearing found
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uilty, was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ransported to the British colonies. The
<PB N="332" REF="340"/>
zeal of her friends, however, seemed to be inflamed
by her conviction; and those who carried on the pro∣secution
against her were insulted, even to the dan∣ger
of their lives. They supplied her with necessaries
of all sorts, paid for her transportation in a private ship,
where she enjoyed all the comforts and conveniencies that
could be afforded in that situation, and furnished her with
such recommendations as secured to her a very agreeable
reception in New-England.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. Next to this very remarkable transaction,
the incident that principally distinguished this year in
England, was the execution of Dr. Archibald Cameron,
a native of North-Britain, and brother to Cameron of
Lochiel, chief of that numerous and warlike tribe, who
had taken the field with the Prince-Pretender. After the
battle of Culloden, where he was dangerously wounded,
he found means to escape to the continent. His brother,
the Doctor, had accompanied him in all his expeditions,
though not in a military capacity, and was included with
him in the act of attainder passed against those who had
been concerned in the rebellion. Notwithstanding the
imminent danger attending such an attempt, the Doctor
returned privately to Scotland, in order (as it was reported)
to recover a sum of money belonging to the Pretender,
which had been embezzled by his adherents in that coun∣try.
Whatever may have been his inducement to revisit
his native country under such a predicament, certain it is,
he was discovered, apprehended, conducted to London,
confined in the Tower, examined by the privy-council,
and produced in the court of King's-Bench, where h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
identity being proved by several witnesses, he received s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣tence
of death, and was executed at Tyburn. The ter∣ror
and resentment of the people, occasioned <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the
rebellion, having by this time subsided, their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umane
passions did not fail to operate in favour of this u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ortunate
gentleman: their pity was mingled with estem, arising
from his personal character, which was alto<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ther unble∣mished,
and his deportment on this occasi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, which they
could not help admiring, as the standard of manly forti∣tude
<PB N="333" REF="341"/>
and decorum. The populace, though not very
subject to tender emotions, were moved to compassion and
even to tears, by his behaviour at the place of execution;
and many sincere well-wishers to the present establishment
thought that the sacrifice of this victim, at such a junc∣ture,
could not redound either to its honour or security.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. The turbulent spirit, which is never
totally extinguished in this island, manifested itself in
sundry tumults that broke out in different parts of South-Britain.
The price of provision, and bread in particular,
being raised to an exorbitant rate, in consequence of an
absurd exportation of corn, for the sake of the bounty, a
formidable body of colliers and other labouring people
raised an insurrection at Bristol, began to plunder the
corn-vessels in the harbour, and commit such outrages in
the city, that the magistrates were obliged to have recourse
to the military power. A troop of dragoons were sent to
their assistance, and the insurgents were quelled, though
not without some bloodshed. Commotions of the same
kind were excited in Yorkshire, Manchester, and several
other places in the northern counties. At Leeds, a de∣tachment
of the King's troops were obliged in their own
defence to fire upon the rioters, eight or nine of whom
were killed on the spot; and, indeed, so little care had
been taken to restrain the licentious insolence of the vul∣gar
by proper laws and regulations, duly executed under
the eye of civil magistracy, that a military power was
found absolutely necessary to maintain the peace of the
kingdom.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. The tranquillity of the continent was not
endangered by any new contest or disturbance: yet the
breach between the clergy and the parliament of Paris
was every day more and more widened, and the people
were pretty equally divided between superstition and a re∣gard
for civil liberty. The parliament having caused
divers ecclesiasticks to be apprehended, for having refused
to administer the sacraments to persons in extremity, who
refused to subscribe to the bull Unigenitus, all of them
<PB N="334" REF="342"/>
declared they acted according to the direction of the Arch∣bishop
of Paris. Application being made to this haughty
prelate, he treated the deputies of the parliament with the
most supercilious contempt, and even seemed to brave the
power and authority of that body. They, on the other
hand, proceeded to take cognizance of the recusant clergy,
until their sovereign ordered them to desist. Then they
presented remonstrances to his Majesty, reminding him
of their privileges, and the duty of their station, which
obliged them to do justice on all delinquents. In the
mean time, they continued to perform their functions,
and even commenced a prosecution against the Bishop of
Orleans, whom they summoned to attend their tribunal.
Next day they received from Versailles a <HI>lettre de cachet,</HI>
accompanied by letters-patent, commanding them to sus∣pend
all prosecutions relating to the refusal of the sacra∣ments;
and ordering the letters-patent to be registered.
Instead of obeying these commands, they presented new
remonstrances, for answers to which they were referred to
the King's former declarations. In consequence of this
intimation, they had spirit enough to resolve, “That,
whereas certain evil-minded persons had prevented truth
from reaching the throne, the chambers remained
assembled, and all other business should be suspended.”
The affair was now become very serious. His Majesty,
by fresh letters-patent, renewed his orders, and command∣ed
them to proceed with their ordinary business, on pain
of incurring his displeasure. They forthwith came to
another resolution, importing, that they could not obey
this injunction without a breach of their duty and their
oath. Next day <HI>lettres de cachet</HI> were issued, banishing to
different parts of the kingdom all the members, except
those of the great chamber, which the court did not find
more tractable than their brethren. They forthwith re∣solved
to abide by the two resolutions mentioned above;
and, as an instance of their unshaken fortitude, ordered an
ecclesiastick to be taken into custody for refusing the sacra∣ments.
This spirited measure involved them in the fate
<PB N="335" REF="343"/>
of the rest; for they were also exiled from Paris, the citi∣zens
of which did not fail to extol their conduct with the
loudest encomiums, and at the same time to express their
resentment against the clergy, who could not stir abroad
without being exposed to violence or insult. The ex∣ample
of the parliament of Paris was followed by that of
Rouen, which had courage enough to issue orders for ap∣prehending
the Bishop of Evreux, because he had refused
to appear when summoned to their tribunal. Their de∣crees
on this occasion being annulled by the King's council
of state, they presented a bold remonstrance, which, how∣ever,
had no other effect than that of exasperating the
ministry. A grand deputation being ordered to attend
the King, they were commanded to desist from intermed∣dling
in disputes relating to the refusal of the sacraments,
and to register this injunction. At their return they had
recourse to a new remonstrance; and one of their princi∣pal
counsellors, who had spoken freely in the debate on
this subject, was arrested by a party of dragoons, who
carried him prisoner to the castle of Dourlens. In a word,
the body of the people declared for the parliament, in
opposition to ecclesiastical tyranny; and, had they not been
overawed by a formidable standing army, would certainly
have taken up arms in defence of their liberties; while the
monarch weakly suffered himself to be governed by priestly
delusions; and, secure in his military appointments, seem∣ed
to set the rest of his subjects at defiance. Apprehensive,
however, that these disputes would put an entire stop to
the administration of justice, he, by letters-patent, esta∣blished
a royal chamber for the prosecution of suits civil
and criminal, which was opened with a solemn mass per∣formed
in the Queen's chapel at the Louvre, where all
the members assisted. On this occasion another difficulty
occurred. The letters-patent constituting this new court
ought to have been registered by the parliament, which
was now no more. To remedy this defect, application
was made to the inferior courts of the Chatelet; which
refusing to register them, one of its members was commit∣ted
<PB N="336" REF="344"/>
to the Bastile, and another absconded. Intimidated
by this exertion of despotick power, they allowed the
King's officers to enter the letters in their register; but
afterwards adopted more vigorous resolutions. The lieu∣tenant
civil appearing in their court, all the counsellors
rose up and retired, leaving him alone, and on the table
an arret, importing, That whereas the confinement of
one of their members, the persecution of another, who
durst not appear, and the present calamities of the nation,
gave them just apprehension for their own persons, they
had, after mature deliberation, thought proper to retire.
Thus a dangerous ferment was excited by the King's es∣pousing
the cause of spiritual insolence and oppression
against the general voice of his people, and the plainest
dictates of reason and common sense.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. The property of East Frieseland continued
still to be the source of contention between the Electors of
Brandenburgh and Hanover. The interests of his Britan∣nick
Majesty being powerfully supported by the house of
Austria, the minister of that power at the diet proposed
that the affair should be taken into immediate consideration.
He was seconded by the minister of Brunswick; but the
envoy from Brandenburgh having protested in form against
this procedure, withdrew from the assembly, and the
Brunswick minister made a counter protestation, after
which he also retired. Then a motion being made, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
this dispute should be referred to the decision of the Aulic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
council at Vienna, it was carried in the affirmative by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
majority of fourteen voices. His Prussian Majesty's fina<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
declaration with regard to this affair was afterwards pre∣sented
to the diet, and answered in the sequel by a memo∣rial
from his Britannick Majesty as Elector of Hanover.
Some other petty disputes likewise happened between the
regency of Hanover, and the city of Munster; and the
former claiming some bailiwicks in the territories of Bre∣men,
sequestered certain revenues belonging to this city
in Stade and Ferden, till these claims should be satisfied.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="345"/>
§ XXXV. The court of Vienna having dropped for the
present the scheme of electing a king of the Romans, con∣cluded
a very extraordinary treaty with the Duke of Mo∣dena,
stipulating, that his serene highness should be ap∣pointed
perpetual governor of the duchy of Milan, with
a salary of ninety thousand florins, on condition that he
should maintain a body of four thousand men, to be at the
disposal of the Empress-Queen; that her Imperial Majesty
should have a right to place garrisons in the citadels of
Mirandola and Reggio, as well as in the castle of Massa-Carrara:
that the Archduke Peter Leopold, third son of
their Imperial Majesties, should espouse the daughter of
the Hereditary Prince of Modena by the heiress of Massa-Carrara;
and, in case of her dying without heirs male,
the estates of that house and the duchy of Mirandola should
devolve to the Archduke; but in case of her having male
issue, that she should enjoy the principality of Fermia, and
other possessions in Hungary, claimed by the Duke of
Modena, for her fortune: finally, that on the extinction
of the male branch of the house of Este, all the dominions
of the Duke of Modena should devolve to the house of
Austria.</P>
<P>§ XXXVI. While the powers on the continent of Eu∣rope
were thus employed in strengthening their respective
interests, and concerting measures for preventing any in∣terruption
of the general tranquillity, matters were fast
ripening to a fresh rupture between the subjects of Great-Britain
and France, in different parts of North-America.
We have already observed that commissaries had been ap∣pointed,
and conferences opened at Paris, to determine
the disputes between the two crowns, relating to the
boundaries of Nova-Scotia; and we took notice in general
of the little arts of evasion practised by the French com∣missaries,
to darken and perplex the dispute, and elude
the pretensions of his Britannick Majesty. They per∣sisted
in employing these arts of chicanery and cavil with
such perseverance, that the negociation proved abortive,
the conferences broke up, and every thing seemed to por∣tend
<PB N="338" REF="346"/>
approaching hostilities. But, before we proceed to
a detail of the incidents which were the immediate fore-runners
of the war, we will endeavour to convey a just
idea of the dispute concerning Nova-Scotia; which, we
apprehend, is but imperfectly understood, though of the
utmost importance to the interest of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. Nova-Scotia, called by the French Acadia,
lies between the forty-fourth and fiftieth degrees of north
latitude, having New-England and the Atlantick ocean
to the south and south-west, and the river and gulf of St.
Laurence to the north and north-east. The winter,
which continues near seven months in this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ountry, is in∣tensely
cold; and, without the intervention of any thing
that can be called spring, it is immediately succeeded by a
summer, the heat of which is almost insupportable, but
of no long continuance. The soil in general is thin and
barren, though some parts of it are said to be equal to the
best land in England. The whole country is covered with
a perpetual fog, even after the summer has commenced.
It was first possessed by the French, before they made any
establishment in Canada; who, by dint of industry and in∣defatigable
perseverance, in struggling with the many
difficulties they necessarily laboured under in the infancy
of this settlement, subsisted tolerably well, and increased
considerably, with very little assistance from Europe;
whilst we even now should lose the immense expense we
have already been at to settle a colony there, and should
see all our endeavours to that end defeated, if the support
of the royal hand was withdrawn but for a moment. This
country, by the possession of which an enemy would be
enabled greatly to annoy all our other colonies, and, if in
the hands of the French, would be of singular service
both to their fishery and their sugar islands, has frequently
changed hands from the French to the English, and from
the English back again to the French, till our right to it
was finally settled by the twelfth article of the treaty of
Utrecht, by which all the country included within the
ancient limits of what was called Nova-Scotia, or Acadia,
<PB N="339" REF="347"/>
was ceded to the English. This article was confirmed
by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle; but for want of as∣certaining
distinctly what were the bounds intended to be
fixed by the two nations with respect to this province,
disputes arose, and commissaries, as we have observed,
were appointed by both sides, to adjust the litigation.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. The commissaries of the King of Great-Britain
conformed themselves to the rule laid down by the
treaty itself, and assigned those as the ancient limits of this
country which had always passed as such, from the very
earliest time of any certainty, down to the conclusion of
the treaty; which the two crowns had frequently declared
to be such, and which the French had often admitted
and allowed. These limits are, the southern bank of the
river St. Laurence to the north, and Pentagoet to the
west: the country situated between these boundaries is
that which the French received by the treaty of St. Ger∣main's,
in the year one thousand six hundred and thirty-two,
under the general name of Acadia. Of this coun∣try,
thus limited, they continued in possession from that
period to the year one thousand six hundred and sixty-four,
when a descent was made upon it, under the command of
Colonel Sedgwick. That these were then the undisputed
limits of Acadia his Britannick Majesty's commissaries
plainly proved, by a letter of Louis XIII. to the Sieurs
Charnisay and La Tour, regulating their jurisdictions in
Acadia; by the subsequent commissions of the French
King to the same persons, as governours of Acadia, in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he sequel; and by that which was afterwards granted to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Sieur Denys, in the year one thousand six hundred
and fifty-four; all of which extend the bounds of this
country from the river St. Laurence to Pentagoet and
New-England. That these were the notions of the French
with respect to the ancient limits of this province was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urther confirmed by the demand made by their ambassa∣dor,
in the course of that same year, for the restitution of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he sorts Pentagoet, St. John's, and Port-Royal, as forts
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tuated in Acadia. In the year one thousand six hundred
<PB N="340" REF="348"/>
and sixty-two, upon the revival of the claim of France to
the country of Acadia, which had been left undecided by
the treaty of Westminster, the French ambassador, then
at the court of London, assigned Pentagoet as the western,
and the river St. Laurence as the northern boundary of
that country; and alledged the restitution of Acadia in the
year one thousand six hunded and thirty-two, and the
possession taken by France in consequence thereof, as well
as the continuation of that possession, with the same limits,
to the year one thousand six hundred and fifty-four, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
proofs of the equity and validity of the claim he then made <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
in which claim, and in the manner of supporting it, he
was particularly approved of by the court of France.
The same court afterwards thought it so clear, upon forme
determinations, and her own former possessions, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
true ancient boundaries of Acadia were Pentagoet to th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
west, and the river St. Laurence to the north, that sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
desired no specification of limits in the treaty of Breda, b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
was contented with the restitution of Acadia, generall
named: and, upon a dispute which arose in the executio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of this treaty, France re-asserted, and Great-Britain
after some discussion, agreed to the above-mentione<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
limits of Acadia; and France obtained possession of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
country, so bounded, under the treaty of Breda. T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
sense of France upon this subject, in the years one thou∣sand six
hundred and eighty-five, and one thousand <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hundred and eighty-seven, was also clearly manifested, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the memorials delivered at that time by the French am∣bassador
at the court of London, complaining of son
encroachments made by the English upon the coast <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Acadia: he described the country as extending from i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee, which lies at the entrance of the river S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Laurence, to St. George's island: and again, in a su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>quent
complaint, made by Mons. Barillon and Mons. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onrepaus to the court of Great-Britain, against <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
judge of Pemaquid, for having seised the effects of
French merchant at Pentagoet, which, said they, w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
situated in Acadia, as restored to France by the treaty <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="341" REF="349"/>
Breda. To explain the sense of France, touching the
bounds of Acadia in the year one thousand seven hundred,
the British commissaries produced a proposal of the French
ambassador, then residing in Great-Britain, to restrain
the limits of that country to the river St. George. They
also instanced the surrender of Port-Royal in the year one
thousand seven hundred and ten, in which Acadia is de∣scribed
with the same limits with which France had re∣ceived
it in the years one thousand six hundred and thirty-two,
and one thousand six hundred and sixty-seven.
And further to ascertain the sense of both crowns, even
at the treaty of Utrecht itself, they produced the Queen of
Great-Britain's instructions to her ambassadors in the year
one thousand seven hundred and eleven, in which they
were directed to insist, “That his Most Christian Ma∣jesty
should quit all claim or title, by virtue of any
former treaty, or otherwise, to the country called
Nova-Scotia, and expressly to Port-Royal, otherwise
Annapolis-Royal.” To these they added a manifest de∣monstration,
founded on indisputable facts, proving,
that the recital of the several sorts of the right which France
had ever pretended to this country, and the specification
of both terms, Acadia, or Nova-Scotia, were intended by
Great-Britain to obviate all doubts which had ever been
made concerning the limits of Acadia and to comprehend
with more certainty all that country which France had
ever received as such: finally, to specify what France
considered as Acadia, during the treaty they referred to
the offers of that crown in the year one thousand seven
hundred and twelve, in which she proposed to restrain the
boundary of Acadia to the river St. George, as a depar∣ture
from its real boundary, in case Great-Britain would
restore to her the possession of that country. From all
these facts it plainly appears, that Great-Britain demanded
nothing but what the fair construction of the words of the
treaty of Utrecht necessarily implies; and that it is impos∣sible
for any thing to have more evident marks of candour
and fairness in it, than the demand of the English on this
<PB N="342" REF="350"/>
occasion. From the variety of evidence brought in sup∣port
of this claim, it evidently results, that the English
commissaries assigned no limits as the ancient limits of
Acadia, but those which France herself determined to be
such in the year one thousand six hundred and thirty-two;
and which he possessd, in consequence of that determi∣nation,
till the year one thousand six hundred and fifty-four;
that in one thousand six hundred and sixty-two
France claimed, and received in one thousand six hundred
and sixty-nine, the country which Great-Britain now
claims as Acadia, restored to France by the treaty of
Breda, under that general denomination: that France
never considered Acadia as having any other limits than
those which were assigned to it from the year one thousand
six hundred and thirty-two, to the year one thousand seven
hundred and ten; and that, by the treaty of Utrecht, she
engaged to transfer that very same country, as Acadia,
which France has always asserted and possessed, and Great-Britain
now claims, as such. Should the crown of
France, therefore, be ever willing to decide what are the
ancient limits of Acadia, by her own declarations so fre∣quently
made in like discussions upon the same point, by
her possessions of this country for almost a century, and
by her description of Acadia, during the negociation of
that very treaty upon which this doubt is raised, she can∣not
but admit the claim of Great-Britain to be conform∣able
to the treaty of Utrecht, and to the description of
the country transferred to Great-Britain by the twelfth
article of that treaty. There is a consistency in the claim
of the English, and a completeness in the evidence brought
in support of it, which is seldom seen in discussions of
this sort; for it rarely happens, in disputes of such a
nature between two crowns, that either of them can safely
offer to have its pretensions decided by the known and re∣peated
declarations, or the possessions of the other. To
answer the force of this detail of conclusive historical facts,
and to give a new turn to the real question in dispute, the
French commissaries, in their memorial, laid it down as a
<PB N="343" REF="351"/>
distinction made by the treaty of Utrecht, that the ancient
limits of Acadia, referred to by that treaty, are different
from any with which that country may have passed under
the treaties of St. Germain's and Breda; and then endea∣voured
to show, upon the testimonies of maps and histo∣rians,
that Acadia and its limits were anciently confined to
the south-eastern part of the peninsula. In support of this
system, the French commissaries had recourse to ancient
maps and historians, who, as they asserted, had ever con∣fined
Acadia to the limits they assigned. They alledged,
that those commissions of the French government over
Acadia, which the English cited as evidences of the limits
they claimed, were given as commissions over Acadia and
the country around it, and not over Acadia only: that
the whole of the country claimed by the English as Acadia
could not possibly be supposed ever to be considered as such,
because many parts of that territory always did, and still
do, preserve particular and distinct names. They affirmed
New France to be a province in itself; and argued, that
many parts of what we claim as Acadia can never have
been in Acadia, because historians and the French com∣missions
of government expressly place them in New
France. They asserted, that no evidence can be drawn
of the opinion of any crown, with respect to the limits of
any country, from its declaration during the negociation
of a treaty; and, in the end, relying upon maps and histo∣rians
for the ancient limits of Acadia, they pretended that
the express restitution of St. Germain's, and the possession
taken by France in consequence of the treaty of Breda,
after a long discussion of the limits, and the declaration of
France during the negociation of the treaty of Utrecht,
were foreign to the point in question. In refutation of
these maxims, the English commissaries proved, from an
examination of the maps and historians cited by the French
in support of their system, that if this question was to be
decided upon the authorities which they themselves allow∣ed
to belong, and to be applicable, to this discussion, the
limits which they assigned were utterly inconsistent with
<PB N="344" REF="352"/>
the best maps of all countries, which are authorities in
point for almost every part of the claim of Great-Britain.
They showed, that the French historians, Champlain and
Denys, and particularly this last, with his commission
in the year one thousand six hundred and fifty-five, assign∣ed
the same northern and western limits to Acadia which
they did; and that Escarbot, another of their historians,
as far as any evidence can be drawn from his writings,
agrees entirely with the former two. They observed,
that all these evidences fall in with and confirm the better
authorities of treaties, and the several transactions be∣tween
the two crowns for near a century past; and that
the French commissaries, by deviating from treaties, and
the late proceedings of the two crowns, to ancient histo∣rians
and maps, only made a transition from an authen∣tick
to an insufficient sort of evidence; and led the English
commissaries into an enquiry, which proved, that both
the proper and the improper, the regular and the foreign
evidence, upon which this matter had been rested,
equally confuted the limits alledged by the French com∣missaries
as the ancient limits of Acadia.</P>

<P>§ I. WHILE the British ministry depended upon the
success of the conferences between the com∣missaries
of the two crowns at Paris, the French were
actually employed in executing their plans of encroach∣ment
upon the British colonies in North-America. Their
scheme was to engross the whole fur-trade of that conti∣nent;
and they had already made great progress in extend∣ing
a chain of forts, connecting their settlements on the
river Mississippi with their possessions in Canada, along the
great lakes of Erie and Ontario, which last issues into the
river St. Laurence. By these means they hoped to ex∣clude
the English from all communication and traffick
with the Indian nations, even those that lay contiguous to
the British settlements, and confine them within a line of
their drawing, beyond which they should neither extend
their trade nor plantations. Their commercial spirit did
not keep pace with the gigantick strides of their ambition:
they could not supply all those Indians with the necessa∣ries
they wanted, so that many of the natives had recourse
to the English settlements; and this commerce produced a
connexion, in consequence of which the British adven∣tures
ventured to travel with merchandise as far as the
banks of the river Ohio, that runs into the Mississippi, a
great way on the other side of the Apalachian mountains,
beyond which none of our colonists had ever attempted to
penetrate. The tract of country lying along the Ohio is
so fertile, pleasant, and inviting, and the Indians, called
Twightees, who inhabit those delightful plains, were so
well disposed towards a close alliance with the English,
that, as far back as the year one thousand seven hundred
and sixteen, Mr. Spotswood, governor of Virginia, pro∣posed
<PB N="347" REF="355"/>
a plan for erecting a company to settle such lands
upon this river as should be ceded to them by treaty with
the natives; but the design was at that time frustrated,
partly by the indolence and timidity of the British ministry,
who were afraid of giving umbrage to the French, and
partly by the jealousies and divisions subsisting between
the different colonies of Great-Britain. The very same
circumstances encouraged the French to proceed in their
project of invasion. At length they penetrated from the
banks of the river St. Laurence, across lake Champlain,
and upon the territory of New York built with impunity,
and, indeed, without opposition, the fort of Crown Point,
the most insolent and dangerous encroachment that they
had hitherto carried into execution.</P>
<P>§ II. Governor Spotswood's scheme for an Ohio compa∣ny
was revived immediately after the peace of Aix-la-Cha∣pelle,
when certain merchants of London, who traded to
Maryland and Virginia, petitioned the government on
this subject, and were indulged not only with a grant of a
great tract of ground to the southward of Pennsylvania,
which they promised to settle; but also with an exclusive
privilege of trading with the Indians on the banks of the
river Ohio. This design no sooner transpired, than the
French governor of Canada took the alarm, and wrote let∣ters
to the governors of New-York and Pennsylvania,
giving them to understand, that as the English inland
traders had encroached on the French territories and pri∣vileges,
by trading with the Indians under the protection
of his sovereign, he would seize them wherever they could
be found, if they did not immediately desist from that
illicit practice. No regard being paid to this intimation,
he next year caused three British traders to be arrested.
Their effects were confiscated, and they themselves con∣veyed
to Quebeck, from whence they were sent prisoners to
Rochelle in France, and there detained in confinement.
In this situation they presented a remonstrance to the Earl
of Albermorle, at that time English ambassador in Paris,
and he claiming them as British subjects, they were set at
<PB N="348" REF="356"/>
liberty. Although, in answer to his lordship's memorial,
the court of Versailles promised to transmit orders to the
French governors in America to use all their endeavours
for preventing any disputes that might have a tendency to
alter the good correspondence established between the two
nations; in all probability the directions given were seem∣ingly
the very reverse of these professions, for the French
commanders, partisans, and agents in America took every
step their busy genius could suggest, to strengthen their
own power, and weaken the influence of the English, by
embroiling them with the Indian nations. This task they
found the more easy, as the natives had taken offence
against the English, when they understood that their lands
were given away without their knowledge, and that there
was a design to build forts in their country, without their
consent and concurrence. Indeed, the person whom the
new company employed to survey the banks of the Ohio
concealed his design so carefully, and behaved in other re∣spects
in such a dark mysterious manner, as could not fail to
arouse the jealousy of a people naturally inquisitive, and
very much addicted to suspicion. How the company
proposed to settle this acquisition in despite of the native
possessors it is not easy to conceive, and it is still more
unaccountable that they should have neglected the natives,
whose consent and assistance they might have procured at a
very small expense. Instead of acting such a fair, open,
and honourable part, they sent a Mr. Gist to make a clan∣destine
survey of the country, as far as the falls of the river
Ohio; and, as we have observed above, his conduct alarm∣ed
both the French and Indians. The erection of this
company was equally disagreeable to the separate traders of
Virginia and Pennsylvania, who saw themselves on the
eve of being deprived of a valuable branch of traffick, by
the exclusive charter of a monopoly; and therefore they
employed their emissaries to foment the jealousy of the
Indians.</P>
<P>§ III. The French having in a manner commenced
hostilities against the English, and actually built forts on
<PB N="349" REF="357"/>
the territories of the British allies at Niagara, and on the
lake Erie, Mr. Hamilton, governor of Pennsylvania, com∣municated
this intelligence to the assembly of the province,
and represented the necessity of erecting truck-houses, or
places of strength and security, on the river Ohio, to which
the traders might retire, in case of insult or molestation.
The proposal was approved, and money granted for the
purpose; but the assembly could not agree about the man∣ner
in which they should be erected; and in the mean time
the French fortified themselves at leisure, and continued to
harrass the traders belonging to the British settlements.
Repeated complaints of these encroachments and depreda∣tions
being represented to Mr. Dinwiddie, governor of Vir∣ginia,
he, towards the latter end of this very year, sent
Major Washington with a letter to the commanding officer
of a fort which the French had built on the Riviere-au-Beuf,
which falls into the Ohio, not far from the lake Erie.
In this letter Mr. Dinwiddie expressed his surprise that the
French should build forts and make settlements on the
river Ohio, in the western part of the colony of Virginia,
belonging to the crown of Great-Britain. He complained
of these encroachments, as well as of the injuries done to
the subjects of Great-Britain, in open violation of the law
of nations, and of the treaties actually subsisting between
the two crowns. He desired to know by whose authority
and instructions his Britannick Majesty's territories had
been invaded; and required him to depart in peace with∣out
further prosecuting a plan which must interrupt the
harmony and good understanding which his Majesty was
desirous to continue and cultivate with the Most Christian
King. To this spirited intimation the officer replied,
That it was not his province to specify the evidence, and
demonstrate the right of the King his master to the lands
situated on the river Ohio; but he would transmit the letter
to the Marquis du Quesne, and act according to the answer
he should receive from that nobleman. In the mean time, he
said he did not think himself obliged to obey the summons of
the English governor; that he commanded the fort by vir∣tue
<PB N="350" REF="358"/>
of an order from his general, to which he was deter∣mined
to conform with all the precision and resolution of a
good officer. Mr. Dinwiddie expected no other reply, and
therefore had projected a fort to be erected near the forks
of the river. The province undertook to defray the ex∣pense,
and the stores for that purpose were already provid∣ed;
but, by some fatal oversight, the concurrence of the
Indians was neither obtained nor sollicited, and, therefore,
they looked upon this measure with an evil eye, as a ma∣nifest
invasion of their property.</P>
<P>§ IV. While the French thus industriously extended
their encroachments to the southward, they were not idle
in the gulf of St. Laurence, but seised every opportunity
of distressing the English settlement of Nova-Scotia. We
have already observed, that the town of Halifax was no
sooner built, than they spirited up the Indians of that
neighbourhood to commit hostilities against the inhabi∣tants,
some of whom they murthered, and others they car∣ried
prisoners to Louisbourg, where they sold them for arms
and ammunition, the French pretending that they main∣tained
this traffick from motives of pure compassion, in
order to prevent the massacre of the English captives,
whom, however, they did not set at liberty, without exact∣ing
an exorbitant ransom. As these sculking parties of
Indians were generally directed and headed by French
commanders, repeated complaints were made to the gover∣nor
of Louisbourg, who still answered, that his jurisdiction
did not extend over the Indians, and that their French con∣ductors
were chosen from the inhabitants of Annapolis,
who thought proper to remain in that country after it was
ceded to the English, and were in fact the subjects of Great-Britain.
Even while the conferences were carried on for as∣certaining
the limits of Nova-Scotia the governor of Canada
detached M. La Corne, with some regular troops, and a
body of militia, to fortify a post on the bay of Chignecto,
on pretence that this and a great part of the peninsula be∣longed
to his government. The possession of this post not
only secured to the Indians of the continent a free entrance
<PB N="351" REF="359"/>
into the peninsula, and a safe retreat in case of pursuit;
but also encouraged the French inhabitants of Annapolis to
rise in open rebellion against the English government.</P>
<P>§ V. In the spring of the year one thousand seven hun∣dred
and fifty, General Cornwallis, governor of Halifax,
detached Major Laurence with a few men to reduce them
to obedience. At his approach they burned their town to
ashes, forsook their possessions, and threw themselves under
the protection of M. La Corne, who, thus re-enforced,
found himself at the head of fifteen hundred men, well
provided with arms and ammunition. Major Laurence
being unable to cope with him in the field, demanded an
interview, at which he desired to know for what cause the
French inhabitants of Nova-Scotia had shaken off their
allegiance to the Crown of Great-Britain, and violated the
neutrality which they had hitherto affected to profess.
The French officer, without pretending to account for
their behaviour, gave him to understand in general terms,
that he had orders to defend his post, and these orders he
was determined to obey. The English Major finding
himself too weak to attack their united force, and having
no orders to commit hostilities against any but the Indians
and their open abettors, returned to Halifax, without having
been able to fulfil the purpose of his expedition. Imme∣diately
after his retreat, the French neutrals (so they were
called) returned to the habitations which they had aban∣doned;
and, in conjunction with the Indians, renewed
their depredations upon the inhabitants of Halifax and its
dependent settlements. The English governor, justly in∣censed
at these outrages, and seeing they would neither sub∣mit
to the English government themselves, nor allow
others to enjoy it with tranquillity, resolved to expel them
effectually from the country they so ill deserved to possess.
Major Laurence was again detached with a thousand men,
transported by sea, to Chignecto, where he found the
French and Indians entrenched, in order to dispute his
landing. Notwithstanding this opposition, he made a de∣scent
with a few companies, received and returned a smart
<PB N="352" REF="360"/>
fire, and rushing into their entrenchments, obliged them to
fly with the utmost precipitation, leaving a considerable
number killed and wounded on the spot. The fugitives
saved themselves by crossing a river, on the farther bank
of which La Corne stood at the head of his troops, drawn
up in order to receive them as friends and dependents. He
had by this time erected a fort, which he denominated Beau
Sejour; and now the English built another on the oppo∣site
side of the river, which was called after its founder St.
Laurence. This being provided with a good garrison,
served as a check upon the French, and in some measure
restrained the incursions of their barbarians. Not that it
effectually answered this purpose; for the Indians and neu∣trals
still seised every opportunity of attacking the English
in the interior parts of the peninsula. In the course of
the succeeding year they surprised the little town of Dart∣mouth,
on the other side of Halifax-bay, where they killed
and scalped a great number of people, and carried off some
prisoners. For these expeditions the French always sup∣plied
them with boats, canoes, arms, and ammunition;
and indeed they were conducted with such care and secre∣sy,
that it was almost impossible to prevent their success.
One sure remedy against the sudden and stolen incursions
of those savages might have been found in the use of staunch
hounds, which would have run upon the foot, detected the
sculking parties of the Indians, and frustrated all their am∣buscades:
but this expedient, so easy and practicable, was
never tried, though frequently recommended in publick to
the attention of the government, and the consideration of
the colonists. The Indians continued to plunder and
massacre the British subjects with impunity, and were
countenanced by the French government in that country,
who now strengthened their lodgement on the neck of the
peninsula with an additional fort, distinguished by the
name of Baye-verte: and built a third at the mouth of St.
John's river, on the north side of the bay of Fundy.</P>
<P>§ VI. All these previous steps to a rupture with Eng∣land
were taken with great deliberation, while the com∣missaries
<PB N="353" REF="361"/>
of both nations were disputing about the limits
of the very country which they thus arrogantly usurped;
and they proceeded to perfect their chain of forts to the
southward, without paying the least regard to the ex∣postulations
of the English governors, or to a memorial
presented at Versailles by the Earl of Albermarle, the British
minister. He demanded that express orders should be sent
to M. De la Jonquiere, the commander for the French in
America, to desist from violence against the British sub∣jects
in that country: that the fort of Niagara should be
immediately rased: that the subjects of Great-Britain, who
had been made prisoners, should be set at liberty, and in∣demnified
for the losses they had sustained: and that the
persons who had committed those excesses should be pu∣nished
in an exemplary manner. True it is, six English∣men,
whom they had unjustly taken, were immediately
dismissed; and the ambassador amused with general pro∣mises
of sending such instructions to the French governor
in America, as should anticipate any cause of complaint for
the future: but, far from having any intention to perform
these promises, the court of Versailles, without all doubt,
exhorted La Jonquiere to proceed in bringing its ambitious
schemes to perfection.</P>
<P>§ VII. Every incident in America seemed to prognosti∣cate
war, when the session of parliament was opened on the
fifteenth day of November: yet his Majesty, on this occa∣sion,
told them, That the events of the year had not made
it necessary for him to offer any thing in particular to their
consideration, relating to foreign affairs. He even de∣clared,
That the continuance of the publick tranquillity,
and the general state of Europe, remained upon the same
footing as when they last parted: and assured them of his
steadiness in pursuing the most effectual measures to pre∣serve
to his people the blessings of peace. He expressed
uncommon concern that the horrid crimes of robbery and
murther were of late rather increased than diminished, and
earnestly recommended this important object to their se∣rious
attention. Affectionate addresses were presented by
<PB N="354" REF="362"/>
both Houses in answer to this harangue: and, what was
very remarkable, they were proposed and passed without
question or debate.</P>
<P>§ VIII. The Commons continued the same number of
seamen and land forces for the ensuing year which had
been granted in the last session, and made suitable provision
for all the exigencies of the state. The whole supply
amounted to two millions seven hundred ninety-seven thou∣sand
nine hundred and sixteen pounds, ten shillings, and
two-pence, to be raised by a land tax of two shillings in
the pound, a malt-tax, a continuation of certain duties on
wine, vinegar, cyder, and beer imported, a sum taken from
the sinking fund, and the overplus of certain grants, funds,
and duties. The provisions made considerably exceeded
the grants; but this excess was chargeable with the interest
of what should be borrowed upon the credit of the land or
malt-tax, there being a clause of credit in both, as also with
the deficiency (if any should happen) in the sums they were
computed to produce. The House agreed to all these re∣solutions
almost unanimously: indeed, no opposition was
made to any of them, but that for continuing the same num∣ber
of land forces, which was carried by a great majority.</P>
<P>§ IX. The act permitting Jews to be naturalized,
which had, during the last session, triumphed over such an
obstinate opposition, was by this time become the object of
national horror and execration. Every part of the king∣dom
resounded with the reproach of the ministry who had
enforced such an odious measure; and the two brothers,
who engrossed the greater part of the administration, trem∣bled
at the prospect of what this clamour might produce at
the general election, this being the last session of the pre∣sent
parliament. So eager were the ministers to annul
this unpopolar measure, that immediately after the Peers
had agreed to the nature and form of an address to his Ma∣jesty,
the D—of N—, with that precipitation so
peculiar to his character, poured <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orth an abrupt harangue,
in that House, importing, that the disaffected had made an
handle of the act passed last session in favour of the Jews,
<PB N="355" REF="363"/>
to raise discontents among many of his Majesty's good
subjects; and as the act was in itself of little importance,
he was of opinion it ought to be repealed; for this purpose
he presented a bill ready framed, which was read and com∣mitted,
though not without some debate. The naturaliza∣tion-bill,
now devoted as a sacrifice to the resentment of
the people, contained a clause disabling all naturalized Jews
from purchasing, inheriting, or receiving any advowson or
presentation, or right to any ecclesiastical benefice or pro∣motion,
school, hospital, or donative; and by the first
draft of the bill, which his grace now presented, it was
intended that this clause should not be repealed. It was
the opinion, however, of the majority, that such a clause
standing unrepealed might imply, that the Jews, by being
thus expressly excluded from the possession of any ecclesi∣astical
right of presentation, would be considered as having
the power and privilege of purchasing and inheriting any
lay-property in the kingdom. On this consideration an
amendment was made in the bill, the clause in question
was left out, and the whole act of naturalization repealed
without exception<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reverend bench of bishops had, with a laudable spirit of christian meekness and philanthropy, generally approved of the indulgence granted to their Hebrew brethren; and now they acquiesced in the proposed repeal with the same passive discretion though one of the number contended for the saving clause which the Duke of N—had recommended.</NOTE>. Though the Lords, in general, con∣curred
in the expediency of the repeal, it was opposed by
some few, as too great a sacrifice to the idle and unfounded
clamours of the multitude; and upon this side of the debate
a great power of elocution was displayed by Earl Temple,
who had lately succeeded to this title on the death of his
mother, a nobleman of distinguished abilities, and the most
amiable disposition, frank, liberal, humane, and zealously
attached to the interest and honour of his country. In the
Lower House the members of both parties seemed to vie
with each other in demonstration of aversion to this un∣popular
act. On the very first day of the session, imme∣diately
after the motion for an address to his Majesty, Sir
James Dashwood, an eminent leader in the opposition,
<PB N="356" REF="364"/>
gave the Commons to understand, that he had a motion of
very great importance to make, which would require the
attention of every member, as soon as the motion for the
address should be discussed: he, therefore, desired they
would not quit the House until he should have an oppor∣tunity
to explain his proposal. Accordingly, they had no
sooner agreed to the motion for an address of thanks to his
Majesty, than he stood up again; and having expatiated
upon the just and general indignation which the act of the
preceding session, in favour of the Jews, had raised among
the people, he moved to order that the House should be
called over on Tuesday the fourth day of December, for
taking that act into consideration: but being given to un∣derstand
that it was not usual to appoint a call of the
House for any particular purpose, he agreed that the mo∣tion
should be general. It was seconded by Lord Parker,
his opposite in political interests; the House agreed to it
without opposition, and the call was ordered accordingly.
They were anticipated, however, by the Lords, who
framed and transmitted to them a bill on the same subject,
to the purport of which the Commons made no objection;
for every member, having the fear of the general election
before his eyes, carefully avoided every expression which
could give umbrage to his constituents: but violent op∣position
was made to the preamble, which ran in the fol∣lowing
strain:—“Whereas an act of parliament was
made and passed in the twenty-fifth year of his Majesty's
reign, intituled, An act to permit persons professing the
Jewish religion to be naturalized by parliament, and for
other purposes therein mentioned; and whereas occa∣sion
has been taken, from the said act, to raise discon∣tents
and disquiets in the minds of his Majesty's subjects,
be it enacted, &amp;c.” This introduction was considered
as an unjust reflexion upon the body of the people in ge∣neral,
and in particular upon those who had opposed the
bill in the course of the preceding session. Sir Roger New∣digate
therefore moved that the expression should be varied
to this effect: “Whereas great discontents and disquie∣tudes
<PB N="357" REF="365"/>
had from the said act arisen.” The consequence
of this motion was an obstinate debate, in which it was
supported by the Earl of Eg—t, and divers other able
orators: but Mr. Pelham and Mr. P—were numbered
among its opponents. The question being put for the
proposed alteration, it was of course carried in the nega∣tive:
the bill, after the third reading, passed <HI>nemine con∣tradicente,</HI>
and in due time obtained the royal assent.</P>
<P>§ X Even this concession of the ministry did not allay
the resentment of the people, and their apprehensions of
encroachment from the Jews. Another act still subsisted,
by virtue of which any person professing the Jewish reli∣gion
might become a free denizen of Great-Britain, after
having resided seven years in any of his Majesty's colo∣nies
in America; and this was now considered as a law
having the same dangerous tendency, of which the other
was now in a fair way of being convicted. It was
moved, therefore, in the Lower House, that part of this
former act might be read: then the same member made
a motion for an address to his Majesty, desiring that the
House might have the perusal of the lists transmitted from
the American colonies to the commissioners for trade and
plantations, containing the names of all such persons
professing the Jewish religion as had entitled themselves
to the benefit of the said act, since the year one thousand
seven hundred and forty. These lists were accordingly
presented, and left upon the table for the perusal of the
members: but as this act contained no limitation of time
within which the benefit of it should be claimed, and as
this claim was attended with a good deal of trouble and
some expense, very few persons had availed themselves of
it in that period. Nevertheless, as a great number of
Jews were already entitled to claim this indulgence, and
as it remained an open channel through which Great-Britain
might be deluged with those people, all of whom
the law would hold as natural-born subjects, and their
progeny as freed from all the restrictions contained in the
act with respect to naturalized foreigners, Lord Harley
<PB N="358" REF="366"/>
moved for leave to bring in a bill to repeal so much of the
said act as related to persons professing the Jewish reli∣gion,
who should come to settle in any British colony
after a certain time. The motion was seconded by Sir
James Dashwood, and supported by the Earl of Egmont;
but being found unequal to the interest and elocution
of Mr. Pelham and Mr. P—, was rejected by the majo∣rity.</P>
<P>§ XI. The next object that claimed the attention
of the Commons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> was a bill for improving the regu∣lations
already made to prevent the spreading of a conta∣gious
distemper, which raged among the horned cattle
in different parts of the kingdom. The last bill of this
session that had the good fortune to succeed, was brought
in for punishing mutiny and desertion of officers and sol∣diers
in the service of the East-India company, and for
the punishment of offences committed in the East-Indies
and the island of St. Helena. This being a measure of a
very extraordinary nature, all the members were ordered
to attend the House on the day fixed for the second read∣ing:
at the same time all charters, commissions, and au∣thorities,
by which any powers relative to a military ju∣risdiction,
or the exercise of martial law, had been
granted or derived from the crown to the said company,
were submitted to the perusal of the members. The
bill was by many considered as a dangerous extension of
military power, to the prejudice of the civil rights en∣joyed
by British subjects, and as such violently contested
by the Earl of Egmont, Lord Strange, and Mr. Alder∣man<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Beckford.
Their objections were answered by the
Sollicitor-General and Mr. Yorke. The bill, after some
warm debates, being espoused by the ministry, was enact∣ed
into a law, and dispatched to the East-Indies by the
first opportunity.</P>
<P>§ XII. Some other motions were made, and petitions
presented on different subjects, which, as they miscarried,
it will be unnecessary to particularise. It may not be
amiss, however, to record an exemplary act of justice
<PB N="359" REF="367"/>
done by the Commons on a person belonging to a pub∣lick
office,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. III. 1754.</NOTE> whom they detected in the practice of fraud
and imposition. Notwithstanding the particular care
taken in the last session, to prevent the monopolizing of
tickets in the state lottery, all those precautions had been
eluded in a scandalous manner by certain individuals, en∣trusted
with the charge of delivering the tickets to the
contributors, according to the intent of the act, which ex∣pressly
declared that not more than twenty should be
sold to any one person. Instead of conforming to these
directions of the legislature, they and their friends en∣grossed
great numbers, sheltering themselves under a false
list of feigned names for the purpose; by which means
they not only defeated the equitable intention of the Com∣mons,
but in some measure injured the publick credit;
inasmuch as their avarice had prompted them to subscribe
for a greater number than they had cash to purchase; so
that there was a deficiency in the first payment, which
might have had a bad effect on the public affairs. These
practices were so flagrant and notorious as to attract the
notice of the Lower House, where an enquiry was begun,
and prosecuted with a spirit of real patriotism, in opposi∣tion
to a scandalous cabal, who endeavoured with equal
eagerness and perseverance to screen the delinquents. All
their efforts, however, proved abortive; and a commit∣tee
appointed to examine particulars, agreed to several
severe resolutions against one Le—, who had amassed a
large fortune by this and other kinds of peculation. They
voted him guilty of breach of trust, and a direct violation
of the Lottery act; and an address was presented to his
Majesty, desiring he might be prosecuted by the Attor∣ney-General
for these offences. He was accordingly sued
in the court of King's-Bench, and paid a fine of one
thousand pounds, for having committed frauds by which
he had gained forty times that sum; but he was treated
with such gentleness as remarkably denoted the clemency
of that tribunal.</P>

§ XIII. The session ended in the beginning of April,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1754.</NOTE>
when the King gave the parliament to understand that he
should say nothing at present on foreign affairs; but as∣sured
them of his fixed resolution to exert his whole power
in maintaining the general tranquillity, and adhering to
such measures for that purpose as he had hitherto pur∣sued
in conjunction with his allies. He in very affection∣ate
terms thanked both Houses for the repeated proofs
they had given of their zealous attachment and loyalty to
his person and government. He enumerated the salutary
measures they had taken for lessening the national debt,
and augmenting the public credit, extending navigation
and commerce, reforming the morals of the people, and
improving the regulations of civil oeconomy. He con∣cluded
with declaring, that he securely relied upon the
loyalty and good affection of his people, and had no other
aim than their permanent happiness. In a little time
after the close of this session they were dissolved by pro∣clamation,
and new writs issued by the Lord Chancellor
for convoking a new parliament. The same ceremonies
were practised with respect to the convocations of Can∣terbury
and York, though they no longer retained their
former importance; nor, indeed, were they suffered to
sit and deliberate upon the subjects which formerly fell
under their cognizance and discussion.</P>
<P>§ XIV. In the beginning of March, the ministry of
Great-Britain had been left without a head by the death
of Mr. Pelham, which was not only sincerely lamented
by his sovereign, but also regretted by the nation in gene∣ral,
to whose affection he had powerfully recommended
himself by the candour and humanity of his conduct and
character, even while he pursued measures which they
did not entirely approve. The loss of such a minister
was the more deeply felt by the government at this junc∣ture,
being the eve of a general election for a new par∣liament,
when every administration is supposed to exert
itself with redoubled vigilance and circumspection. He
had already concerted the measures for securing a majority,
<PB N="361" REF="369"/>
and his plan was faithfully executed by his friends and
adherents, who still engrossed the administration. His bro∣ther
the Duke of Newcastle, was appointed first lord
commissioner of the Treasury, and succeeded as secretary
of state by Sir Thomas Robinson, who had long resided as
ambassador at the court of Vienna. The other department
of this office was still retained by the Earl of Holdernesse,
and the function of chancellor of the Exchequer was per∣formed
as usual by the Lord Chief Justice of the King's-Bench,
until a proper person could be found to fill that
important office: but in the course of the summer it was
bestowed upon Mr. Legge, who acquitted himself with
equal honour and capacity. Divers other alterations
were made, of less importance to the public. Sir George
Lyttelton was appointed cofferer, and the Earl of Hillsbo∣rough
comptroller of the household. Mr. George Gren∣ville,
brother to Earl Temple, became treasurer of the
Navy; and Mr. Charles Townshend, of whom we shall
have occasion to speak in the sequel, took place as a com∣missioner
at the board of Admiralty, in the room of Lord
Barrington, made master of the wardrobe. Lord Hard∣wicke,
the chancellor, was promoted to the dignity of
an earl. The place of lord chief justice of the King's-Bench
becoming vacant by the death of Sir William Lee,
was filled with Sir Dudley Ryder, and he was succeeded
by Mr. Murray in the office of Attorney-General.</P>
<P>§ XV. The election for the new parliament generally
succeeded according to the wish of the ministry; for op∣position
was now dwindled down to the lowest state of
imbecility. It had received a mortal wound by the death
of the late Prince of Wales, whose adherents were too wise
to pursue an <HI>ignis fatuus,</HI> without any prospect of success
or advantage. Some of them had prudently sung their
palinodia to the ministry, and been gratified with profit∣able
employments; while others, setting too great a price
upon their own importance, kept aloof till the market was
over, and were left to pine in secret over their disappoint∣ed
ambition. The maxims of Toryism had been relin∣quished
<PB N="362" REF="370"/>
by many, as the barren principles of a losing game:
the body of the people were conciliated to the established
government; and the harmony that now, for the first
time, subsisted among all the branches of the royal family
had a wonderful effect in acquiring a degree of popularity
which they had never before enjoyed. The writs being
returned, the new parliament was opened on the last day
of May by the Duke of Cumberland, and some other
peers, who acted by virtue of a commission from his Ma∣jesty.
The Commons having chosen for their speaker the
Right Hon. Arthur Onflow, who had honourably filled
that high office in four preceding parliaments, he was
presented and approved by the commissioners. Then the
Lord High Chacellor harangued both Houses, giving
them to understand, that his Majesty had indulged them
with this early opportunity of coming together, in order
to complete without loss of time certain parliamentary
proceedings, which he judged would be for the satisfaction
of his good subjects; but he did not think proper to lay
before them any points of general business, reserving
every thing of that nature to the usual time of their assem∣bling
in the winter. On the fifth day of June this short
session was closed, and the parliament prorogued by the
lords commissioners.</P>
<P>§ XVI. In the beginning of this year violent dis∣putes
arose between the government and the House of
Commons in Ireland, on the almost forgotten subjects
of privilege and prerogative. The Commons conceived
they had an undoubted right to apply the surplus of their
revenue towards national purposes, without the consent of
their sovereign; and accordingly, in the year one thou∣sand
seven hundred and forty-nine, prepared a bill with
this preamble: “Whereas on the twenty-fifth day of
March last a considerable balance remained in the hands
of the vice treasurers or receivers-general of the king∣dom,
or their deputy or deputies, unapplied; and it
will be for your Majesty's service, and for the ease of
your faithful subjects in this kingdom, that so much
thereof as can be conveniently spared should be paid,
<PB N="363" REF="371"/>
agreeably to your Majesty's most gracious intentions,
in discharge of part of the national debt.” This ap∣propriation
gave great offence to the advocates for prero∣gative
in England, who affirmed that the Commons had
no right to apply any part of the unappropriated revenue,
nor even to take any such affair into consideration, with∣out
the previous consent of the crown, expressed in the
most explicit terms. It was in consequence of this doc∣trine
that the Duke of Dorset, lord-lieutenant of Ireland,
told them in the next session of parliament, held in the
year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-one, he was
commanded by the king to acquaint them, that his Ma∣jesty,
ever attentive to the ease and happiness of his sub∣jects,
would graciously consent, and recommended it
to them, that such a part of the money then remaining
in his treasury as should be thought consistent with the
publick service be applied towards the further reduction
of the national debt. This declaration alarmed the Com∣mons,
zealous as they were for the preservation of their
privileges; and in their address of thanks, which, like
that of the parliament of Great-Britain, used always to
eccho back the words of the speech, they made no menti∣on
of his Majesty's consent; but only acknowledged his
gracious attention to their ease and happiness, in recom∣mending
to them the application of the surplus. They,
accordingly, resolved to apply one hundred and twenty
thousand pounds of that overplus towards a discharge of
the national debts; and, in the preamble of the bill,
framed for this purpose, made no mention of his Majesty's
consent, though before they had acknowledged his goodness
in recommending this application. The ministry in Eng∣land
were highly offended at this purposed omission, which
they construed into a wilful encroachment on the prero∣gative;
and the bill was sent back with an alteration in
the preamble, signifying his Majesty's consent as well as
recommendation. The Irish House of Commons being
at that time deeply engaged in a minute enquiry into the
conduct of a gentleman, a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervant of the crown, and a
<PB N="364" REF="372"/>
member of their own House, accused of having misapplied
a large sum of money, with which he had been entrusted,
for rebuilding or repairing the barracks, were now un∣willing
to embroil themselves farther with the government,
until this affair should be discussed. They, therefore,
passed the bill with the alteration, and proceeded with
their enquiry. The person was convicted of having mis∣applied
the publick money, and ordered to make the bar∣racks
fit for the reception and accommodation of the troops
at his own expense. They did not, however, neglect to
assert what they thought their rights and privileges, when
the next opportunity occurred. The Duke of Dorset,
when he opened the session of this year, repeated the ex∣pression
of his Majesty's gracious consent, in mentioning
the surplus of the publick money. They again omitted
that word in their address; and resolved, in their bill of
application, not only to sink this odious term, but likewise
to abate in their complaisance to the crown, by leaving
out that expression of grateful acknowledgement, which
had met with such a cold reception above. By this time
the contest had kindled up two violent factions, and diffused
a general spirit of resentment through the whole Irish
nation. The committee who prepared the bill, instead of
inserting the usual compliments in the preamble, men∣tioned
nothing but a recital of facts, and sent it over in a
very plain dress, quite destitute of all embroidery. The
ministry, intent upon vindicating the prerogative from
such an unmannerly attack, filled up the omissions of the
committee, and sent it back with this alteration: “And
your Majesty, ever attentive to the ease and happiness
of your faithful subjects, has been graciously pleased to
signify that you would consent, and to recommend it
to us, that so much of the money remaining in your
Majesty's treasury as should be necessary be applied to
the discharge of the national debt, or such part thereof
as should be thought expedient by parliament.” This,
then, being the crisis which was to determine a constitutional
point of such importance, namely, whether the people
<PB N="365" REF="373"/>
in parliament assembled have a right to deliberate upon,
and vote the application of any part of the unappropri∣ated
revenue, without the previous consent of the crown;
those who were the most zealously attached to the liberties
of their country resolved to exert themselves in opposing
what they conceived to be a violation of those liberties;
and the bill, with its alterations, was rejected by a majo∣rity
of five voices. The success of their endeavours was
celebrated with the most extravagant rejoicings, as a tri∣umph
of patriotism over the arts of ministerial corruption;
and, on the other hand, all the servants of the crown
who had joined the popular cry on this occasion were in
a little time dismissed from their employments. The re∣jection
of the bill was a great disappointment to the credi∣tors
of the publick, and the circulation of cash was almost
stagnated. These calamities were imputed to arbitrary
designs in the government; and the people began to be
inflamed with an enthusiastick spirit of independency,
which might have produced mischievous effects, had not
artful steps been taken to bring over the demagogues, and
thus divert the stream of popular clamour from the mini∣stry
to those very individuals who had been the idols of
popular veneration. The Speaker of the House of Com∣mons
was promoted to the dignity of an earl; and some
other patriots were gratified with lucrative employments.
His Majesty's letter arrived for paying off seventy-five thou∣sand
five hundred pounds of the national debt. The cir∣culation
was thus animated, and the resentment of the
populace subsiding, the kingdom retrieved its former tran∣quillity.</P>
<P>§ XVII. The ambition and intrigues of the French
court, by which the British interest was invaded and di∣sturbed
on the continent of America, had also extended
itself to the East-Indies, where they endeavoured to em∣broil
the English company with divers nabobs, or princes,
who governed different parts of the peninsula intra Gangem.
That the reader may have a clear and distinct idea of these
transactions, we shall exhibit a short sketch of the English
<PB N="366" REF="374"/>
forts and settlements in that remote country. The first
of these we shall mention is Surat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Several European nations had settlements at Surat, which was one of the most frequented cities of the East, from the great concourse of Maho∣metan pilgrims, who make it their road from India, in their visits to the tomb of their prophet at Mecca. In order to keep the seas clear of pirates between Surat and the gulf of Arabia and Persia, the Mogul had been at the annual expese of a large ship fitted out on purpose to carry the pilgrims to Judda, which is within a small distance of Mecca. For the security of this ship, as well as to protect the trade of Surat, he granted to his admiral, <HI>the siddee,</HI> chief of a colony of caffrecs, or blacks, a revenue called the Tanka, to the value of three lacks of rupees, amounting to above thirty-seven thousand pounds, arising partly from the adjacent lands, and partly from the revenues of Surat, which were paid him yearly by the governor of the castle, who is appointed by the Mogul to keep the city under proper subjection, without, however, interfering with the govern∣ment of it.</NOTE>, in the province so
called, situated between the twenty-first and twenty-second
degrees of north latitude: from hence the peninsula stretches
into the Indian ocean, as far as the latitude of eight
north, ending in a point at Cape Comorin, which is the
southern extremity. To the northward this peninsula
joins to Indostan, and at its greatest breadth extends seven
hundred miles. Upon the west, east, and south, it is
washed by the sea. It comprehends the kingdoms of Mala∣bar,
Decan, Golconda, and Bisnagar, with the princi∣palities
of Gingi, Tanjaour, and Madura. The western
side is distinguished by the name of the Malabar coast:
the eastern takes the denomination of Coromandel; and
in different parts of this long sweep, from Surat round
Cape Comorin to the bottom of the bay of Bengal, the
English and other European powers have, with the con∣sent
of the Mogul, established forts and trading settlements.
All these kingdoms, properly speaking, belong to the
Mogul: but his power was so weakened by the last inva∣sion
of Kouli Khan, that he has not been able to assert his
empire over this remote country; the tributary princes of
which, and even the nabobs, who were originally gover∣nors
appointed under their authority, have rendered them∣selves
independent, and exert an absolute dominion over
their respective territories, without acknowledging his
superiority either by tribute or homage. These princes,
<PB N="367" REF="375"/>
when they quarrel among themselves, naturally have re∣course
to the assistance of such European powers as are
settled in or near their dominions; and in the same manner
the East-Indian companies of the European powers which
happen to be at war with each other never fail to interest
the nabobs in the dispute.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. The next English settlement to Surat, on
the coast of the peninsula, is Bombay, in the kingdom of
Decan, a small island, with a very convenient harbour,
about five-and-forty leagues to the south of Surat. The
town is very populous: but the soil is barren, and the
climate unhealthy; and the commerce was rendered very
precarious by the neighbourhood of the famous Corsair
Angria, until his port of Geriah was taken, and his forti∣fications
demolished. The English company likewise
carry on some traffick at Dabul, about forty leagues
farther to the south, in the province of Cuncan. In the
same southerly progression, towards the point of the penin∣sula,
we arrive at Carwar, in the latitude of fifteen de∣grees,
where there is a small fort and factory belonging
to the company, standing on the south side of a bay, with
a river capable of receiving ships of pretty large burthen.
The climate here is remarkably salubrious; the country
abounds with provisions of all sorts, and the best pepper
of India grows in this neighbourhood. The next English
settlement we find at Tillicherry, where the company has
erected a fort, to defend their commerce of pepper and
cardamoms from the insults of the Rajah, who governs this
part of Malabar. Hither the English trade was removed
from Calicut, a large town, that stands fifteen leagues to
the southward of Tillicherry, and was as well frequented
as any port on the coast of the Indian peninsula. The most
southerly settlement which the English possess on the Ma∣labar
coast is that of Anjengo, between the eighth and ninth
degrees of latitude. It is defended by a regular fort,
situated on a broad river, which falls into the sea, and would
be very commodious for trade, were not the water on the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar too shallow to admit ships of considerable burthen.
<PB N="368" REF="376"/>
Then turning the cape, and passing through the strai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
of Chilao, formed by the island of Ceylon, we arrive o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the coast of Coromandel, which forms the eastern side o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the isthmus. Prosecuting our course in a northern direction
the first English factory we reach is that of Fort St▪
David's, formerly called Tegapatan, situated in the lati∣tude
of eleven degrees forty minutes north, within th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
kingdom of Gingi. It was, about six-and twenty-year
ago sold by a Mahratta prince to the East-India company
and, next to Bombay, is the most considerable settlemen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
we have yet mentioned. Its territory extends about eight
miles along the coast, and half that space up the country
which is delightfully watered by a variety of rivers: th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
soil is fertile, and the climate healthy. The fort is regu∣lar,
well provided with cannon, ammunition, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
numerous garrison, which is the more necessary, on accoun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of the neighbourhood of the French settlement at Pondi∣cherry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The trade consists of long cloths of different colours, sallampo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> mor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, dimities, ginghams, and succatoons.</NOTE>. But the chief settlement belonging to the com∣pany
on this coast is that of Madras, or Fort St. George
standing farther to the northward, between the thirteenth
and fourteenth degrees of latitude, and not a great way
from the diamond mines of Golconda. It is seated on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
flat, barren, scorching sand, so near the sea, that, in bad
weather, the walls are endangered by the mighty surge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
rolled in from the ocean. As the soil is barren, the cli∣mate
is so intensely hot, that it would be altogether un<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inhabitable,
were not the heat mitigated by the sea-breeses▪
On the land side it is defended by a salt-water river, which
while it contributes to the security of the place, robs th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
inhabitants of one great comfort, by obstructing th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
springs of fresh water. The fort is a regular square, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
town surrounded with walls well mounted with artillery
and the place, including the Black Town, is very popu∣lous.
Madras, with several villages in the neighbourhood
was purchased of the King of Golconda, before the Mo∣gul
became sovereign of this country. The governor o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
this place is not only president of Fort St. George, but
<PB N="369" REF="377"/>
also of all the other settlements on the coasts of Malabar
and Coromandel, as far as the island of Sumatra. He lives
in great pomp, having inferior judges, who pass sentence of
death occasionally on malefactors of any nation, except
the subjects of Great-Britain. All the company's affairs
are directed by him and his council, who are invested with
the power of inflicting corporal punishment, short of life
and member, upon such Europeans as are in the service,
and dispose of all places of trust and profit. By virtue of
an act passed in the course of this very session, the mili∣tary
officers belonging to the company were permitted to
hold courts-martial, and punish their soldiers according
to the degree of their delinquency. In a word, Madras
is of the utmost importance to the company for its strength,
wealth, and the great returns it makes in callicoes and
muslins. Towards the latter end of the last century the
English company had a flourishing factory at Masulipatam,
standing on the north side of the river Nagundi, which
separates the provinces of Golconda and Bisnagar, in the
latitude of sixteen degrees and thirty minutes; but now
there is no European settlement here, except a Dutch
factory, maintained for carrying on the chintz commerce.
At Visigapatam, situated still farther to the northward, the
English possess a factory, regularly fortified, on the side
of a river which, however, a dangerous bar has rendered
unfit for navigation. The adjacent country affords cotton
cloths, and the best striped muslins of India. It is chiefly
for the use of this settlement that the company maintains
a factory at Ganjam, the most eastern town in the province
or kingdom of Golconda, situated in a country abounding
with rice and sugar canes. Still farther to the north coast,
in the latitude of twenty-two degrees, the company main∣tains
a factory at Balasore, which was formerly very con∣siderable;
but hath been of very little consequence since
the navigation of the river Huguely was improved. At
this place every European ship bound for Bengal and the
Ganges takes in a pilot. The climate is not counted very
salubrious; but the adjacent country is fruitful to admi∣ration,
and here are considerable manufactures of cotton
<PB N="370" REF="378"/>
and silk. Without skilful pilots, the English would find
it very difficult to navigate the different channels through
which the river Ganges discharges itself into the sea at the
bottom of the bay of Bengal. On the southern branch is
a town called Pipely, where there was formerly an English
factory: but this was removed to Hunguel, one hundred
and sixty miles farther up the river; a place which, to∣gether
with the company's settlement at Calcutta, were
the emporiums of their commerce for the whole kingdom
of Bengal. Indeed Hunguely is now abandoned by the
English, and their whole trade centres at Calcutta or Fort
William, which is regular fortification, containing lodg∣ings
for the factors and writers, store-houses for the com∣pany's
merchandise, and magazines for their ammunition.
As for the governor's house, which likewise stands within
the fort, it is one of the most regular structures in all India.
Besides these settlements along the sea-coast of the penin∣sula,
and on the banks of the Ganges, the English East-India
company possess certain inland factories and posts for
the convenience and defence of their commerce, either
purchased of the nabobs and rajahs, or conquered in the
course of the war. As the operations we propose to record
were confined to the coasts of Malabar and Coromandel,
or the interior countries which form the peninsula intra
Gangem, it will be unnecessary to describe the factory at
Bencoolen, on the island of Sumatra, or any settlement
which the English possess in other parts of the East-Indies.</P>
<P>§ XIX. In order to understand the military transactions
of the English company in India, the reader will take
notice, that immediately after the peace of Aix-la-Cha∣pelle,
Monsieur Dupleix, who commanded for the French
in that country, began by his intrigues to sow the seeds
of dissention among the nabobs, that he might be the
better able to fish in troubled waters. Nizam Almuluck,
the Mogul's viceroy of Decan, having the right of nomi∣nating
a governor of the Carnatick, now more generally
known by the name of the Nabob of Arcot, appointed
<PB N="371" REF="379"/>
Anaverdy Khan to that office, in the year one thousand
seven hundred and forty-five. The viceroy dying was suc∣ceeded
in his viceroyalty, or subaship, by his second son
Nazirzing, whom the Mogul confirmed. He was opposed
in his pretensions by his own cousin Muzapherzing, who
had recourse to the assistance of M. Dupleix, and obtained
from him a re-enforcement of Europeans and artillery, in
consideration of many presents, and promises, which he
fulfilled in the sequel. Thus re-enforced, and joined by
one Chunda Saib, an active Indian chief, he took the field
against his kinsman Nazirzing, who was supported by a
body of English troops under Colonel Laurence. The
French, dreading an engagement, retired in the night;
and Muzapherzing, seeing himself abandoned by all his
own troops, appealed to the clemency of his cousin, who
spared his life, but detained him as a state prisoner. In
this situation, he formed a conspiracy against his kinsman's
life, with Nazirzing's prime minister, and the Nabobs of
Cadupab and Condaneor, then in his camp; and the con∣spirators
were encouraged in their scheme by Dupleix and
Chunda Saib, who had retired to Pondicherry. Thus
stimulated, they murthered Nazirzing in his camp, and
proclaimed Muzapherzing viceroy of Decan. In the tents
of the murthered viceroy they found an immense treasure,
of which a great share fell to M. Dupleix, whom Mu∣zapherzing
the usurper at this time associated in the govern∣ment.
By virtue of this association the Frenchman
assumed the state and formalities of an eastern prince; and
he and his colleague Muzapherzing appointed Chunda
Saib Nabob of Arcot. Anaverdy Khan, the late nabob,
had been, in the year one thousand seven hundred and
forty-nine, defeated and slain by Muzapherzing and
Chunda Saib, with the assistance of their French auxilia∣ries;
and his son Mahomed Ali Khan had put himself
under the protection of the English at Madras, and was
confirmed by Nazirzing, as his father's successor in the
nabobship or government of Arcot. This government,
therefore, was disputed between Mahommed Ali Khan,
<PB N="372" REF="380"/>
appointed by the legal viceroy Nazirzing, supported by
the English company, and Chunda Saib, nominated by
the usurper Muzapherzing, and protected by Dupleix,
who commanded at Pondicherry. Muzapherzing did not
long survive his usurpation. In the year one thousand seven
hundred and fifty-one, the same nabobs who had promoted
him to his kinsman's place, thinking themselves ill rewarded
for their service, fell upon him suddenly, routed his troops,
and put him to death; and next day the chiefs of the
army proclaimed Sallabatzing, brother to Nazirzing,
viceroy of Decan: on the other hand, the Mogul ap∣pointed
Gauzedy Khan, who was the elder brother of
Sallabatzing; and this prince confirmed Mahommed Ali
Khan in the government of Arcot; but the affairs of
the Mogul's court were then in such confusion, that he
could not spare an army to support the nomination he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
made. Chunda Saib, Nabob of Arcot, having been de∣posed
by the Great Mogul, who placed Anaverdy Khan in
his room, he resolved to recover his government by force,
and had recourse to the French general at Pondicherry,
who re-enforced him with two thousand sepoys, or soldiers
of the country, sixty caffrees, and four hundred and twenty
French troops, on condition that, if he proved successful<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in his enterprize, he should cede to the French the town
of Velur, in the neighbourhood of Pondicherry, with its
dependencies, consisting of forty-five-villages. Thus re-enforced,
he defeated his rival Anaverdy Khan, who los<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his life in the engagement, re-assumed the government of
Arcot, and punctually performed the conditions which
had been stipulated by his French allies.</P>
<P>§ XX. Mahommed Ali Khan, at the death of his fa∣ther,
had fled to Tiruchirapalli<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tiruchirapalli, commonly called Trichinopoly, situated near the river Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>veri, above two hundred miles to the southward of Madras, is the ca∣pital of a small kingdom belonging to the government of Arcot, and b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>und∣ed on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast by the kingdom of Tanjore.</NOTE>, and sollicited the as∣sistance
of the English, who favoured him with a re-enforce∣ment
of money, men, and ammunition, under the conduct
<PB N="373" REF="381"/>
of Major Laurence, a brave and experienced officer. By
dint of this supply, he gained some advantages over the
enemy, who were obliged to retreat; but no decisive blow
was given. Mahommed afterwards repaired in person to
Fort St. David's, to demand more powerful succours,
alledging that his fate was connected with the interest of
the English company, which in time would be obliged to
abandon the whole coast, should they allow the enemy to
proceed in their conquests. In consequence of these re∣presentations,
he received another strong re-enforcement,
under the command of Captain Cope; but nothing of im∣portance
was attempted, and the English auxiliaries retired.
Then Mahommed was attacked by the enemy, who ob∣tained
a complete victory over him. Finding it impossible
to maintain his footing by his own strength, he entered
into a close alliance with the English, and ceded to them
some commercial points, which had been long in dispute.
Then they detached Captain Cope to put Tiruchirapalli
in a posture of defence; while Captain de Gingins, a Swiss
officer, marched at the head of four hundred Europeans to
the nabob's assistance. The two armies being pretty equal
in strength, lay encamped in sight of each other a whole
month; during which nothing happened but a few skir∣mishes,
which generally terminated to the advantage of the
English auxiliaries. In order to make a diversion, and di∣vide
the French forces, the company resolved to send a de∣tachment
into the province of Arcot; and this was one of
the first occasions upon which the extraordinary talents of
Mr. Clive were displayed. He had entered into the ser∣vice
of the East-India company as a writer, and was consi∣dered
as a person very indifferently qualified for succeeding
in any civil station of life. He now offered his service in a
military capacity, and actually began his march to Arcot,
at the head of two hundred and ten Europeans, with five
hundred sepoys<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The sepoys are mercenaries of the country, who are hired as soldiers occasionally by all parties.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="382"/>
§ XXI. Such was the resolution, secresy, and dispatch
with which he conducted this enterprise, that the enemy
knew nothing of his motions until he was in possession of
the capital, which he took without opposition. The inha∣bitants,
expecting to be plundered, offered him a large sum
to spare their city; but they derived their security from
the generosity and discretion of the conqueror. He re∣fused
the proffered ransom, and issued a proclamation,
intimating, That those who were willing to remain in
their houses should be protected from insult and injury,
and the rest have leave to retire with all their effects, ex∣cept
provisions, for which he promised to pay the full va∣lue.
By this sage conduct he conciliated the affections of
the people so entirely, that even those who quitted the place
supplied him with exact intelligence of the enemy's de∣signs,
when he was besieged in the sequel. The town was
in a little time invested by Raja Saib, son of Chunda Saib,
at the head of a numerous army, and the operations of the
siege were conducted by European engineers. Though
their approaches were retarded by the repeated and resolute
sallies of Mr. Clive, they at length effected two breaches,
supposed to be practicable; and on the 14th day of Octo∣ber,
in the year 1751, gave a general assault. Mr. Clive,
having received intimation of their design, had made such
preparations for their reception, that they were repulsed
in every quarter with great loss, and obliged to raise the
siege with the utmost precipitation.</P>
<P>§ XXII. This gallant Englishman, not contented with
the reputation he had acquired from his noble defence, was
no sooner re-enforced by a detachment under Captain Kirk∣patrick
from Trichinopoly, than he marched in pursuit of
the enemy, whom he overtook in the plains of Arani.
There, on the third day of December, he attacked them
with irresistible impetuosity; and, after an obstinate dis∣pute,
obtained a complete victory at a very small expense.
The forts of Timery, Caujeveram, and Aranie, surrendered
to the terror of his name, rather than to the force of his
arms; and he returned to Fort St. David's in triumph. He
<PB N="375" REF="383"/>
had enjoyed a very few weeks of repose, when he was sum∣moned
to the field by fresh incursions of the enemy. In
the beginning of the year one thousand seven hundred and
fifty-two, he marched with a small detachment to Madras,
where he was joined by a re-enforcement from Bengal, the
whole number not exceeding three hundred Europeans,
and assembled a body of the natives, that he might have at
least the appearance of an army. With these he proceed∣ed
to Koveripauk, about fifteen miles from Arcot, where
he found the French and Indians, consisting of fifteen hun∣dred
sepoys, seventeen hundred horse, a body of natives,
and one hundred and fifty Europeans, with eight pieces of
cannon. Though they were advantageously posted and
entrenched, and the day was already far advanced, Mr.
Clive advanced against them with his usual intrepidity;
but the victory remained for some time in suspense. It was
now dark, and the battle doubtful, when Mr. Clive sent
round a detachment to fall on the rear of the French bat∣tery.
This attack was executed with great resolution,
while the English in front entered the entrenchments
with their bayonets fixed; and, though very little tinctured
with discipline, displayed the spirit and activity of hardy
veterans. This double attack disconcerted the enemy in
such a manner, that they soon desisted from all opposition.
A considerable carnage ensued; yet the greater part of the
enemy, both horse and foot, saved themselves by flight,
under cover of the darkness. The French, to a man,
threw down their arms, and surrendered themselves pri∣soners
of war; and all the cannon and baggage fell into
the hands of the victor.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. The province of Arcot being thus cleared of
the enemy, Mr. Clive with his forces returned to Fort St.
David's, where he sound Major Laurence just arrived from
England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Major Laurence had failed for England in the year 1750.</NOTE>, to take upon him the command of the troops in
the company's service. On the eighteenth day of March
this officer, accompanied by Mr. Clive, took the field,
and was joined by Captain de Gingins at Tiruchirapalli.
<PB N="376" REF="384"/>
From hence he detached Mr. Clive, with four hundred
European soldiers, a few Mahratta horse, and a body of
sepoys, to cut off the enemy's retreat to Pondicherry. In
the course of this expedition he dislodged a strong body of
the foe posted at Samiaveram, and obliged Chunda Saib to
throw a body of troops into a strong fortified temple, or
pagoda, upon the river Koleroon, which was immediately
invested. The commanding officer, in attempting to
escape, was slain with some others, and the rest surrendered
at discretion. They were still in possession of another for∣tified
temple, which he also besieged in form, and reduced
by capitulation. Having subdued these forts, he marched
directly to Volconda, whither he understood the French
commander D'Anteuil had retired. He found that officer
entrenched in a village, from whence he drove him with
precipitation, and made himself master of the French can∣non.
The enemy attempted to save themselves in a neigh∣bouring
fort; but the gates being shut against them by the
governor, who was apprehensive that they would be follow∣ed
pell-mell by the English, Mr. Clive attacked them
with great fury, and made a considerable slaughter: but his
humanity being shocked at this carnage, he sent a flag of
truce to the vanquished, with terms of capitulation, which
they readily embraced. These articles imported, That
D'Anteuil, and three other officers, should remain priso∣ners
on parole for one year; that the garrison should be
exchanged, and the money and stores be delivered to the
nabob whom the English supported.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. During these transactions Chunda Saib lay
encamped with an army of thirty thousand men at Syrin∣ham,
an island in the neighbourhood of Tiruchirapalli,
which he longed eagerly to posses. Hither Major Lau∣rence
marched with his Indian allies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His army consisted of twelve hundred Europeans and Topasses in bat∣talions, two thousand sepoys; with the forces of the nabob, the Kings of Tanjore, Muissack, and the Mahrattas; amounting to fifteen hundred horse and ten thousand infantry. Topasses are descendants from the Portu∣guese. The Mahrattas are native Indians of a very numerous and power∣ful nation, which hath more than once given law to the Mogul.</NOTE>, and took his mea∣sures
<PB N="377" REF="385"/>
so well, that the enemy's provisions were entirely in∣tercepted.
Chunda Saib, in attempting to fly, was taken
prisoner by the Nabob of Tanjore, an ally of the English
company, who ordered his head to be struck off, in order
to prevent the disputes which otherwise would have arisen
among the captors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chunda Saib demanded leave of the Tanjore general to pass through his camp to Tanjore, and thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> request was granted; but, instead of being al∣lowed to pass, he was detained prisoner, and as the allies could not agree about the manner in which he should be disposed of, some of the Tanjore officers, of their own accord, ended the dispute, by cutting off his head.</NOTE>. The main body of the army being
attacked by Major Laurence, and totally defeated, the
island of Syrinham was surrendered, and about a thousand
European French soldiers, under the command of Mr.
Law, nephew to the famous Law who schemed the Mis∣sissippi
company, fell into the hands of the conquerors,
including thirty officers, with forty pieces of cannon, and
ten mortars. M. Dupleix, though exceedingly mortified
by this disaster, resolved to maintain the cause which he
had espoused. He proclaimed Raja Saib, the son of Chun∣da
Saib, nabob of Arcot; and afterwards pretended that
he himself had received from the Mogul sanids or com∣missions,
appointing him governor of all the Carnatick,
from the river Kristnah to the sea: but these sanids appear∣ed
in the sequel to be forged. In order to complete the
comedy, a supposed messenger from Delhi was received at
Pondicherry as ambassador from the Mogul. Dupleix,
mounted on an elephant, preceded by musick and dancing
women, in the oriental manner, received in publick his
commission from the hands of the pretended ambassador.
He assected the eastern state, kept his darbar or court, where
he appeared sitting cross-legged on a sopha, and received
presents as prince of the country from his own council, as
well as from the natives. In the mean time, hostilities
continued between the forces of the two companies, as
auxiliaries to the contending nabobs. The English, under
Major Kinnier, made an unsuccessful attempt upon Gin∣gee,
a strong town situated to the west of Pondicherry.
Major Laurence defeated a strong body of French and na∣tives,
<PB N="378" REF="386"/>
commanded by Dupleix's nephew, M. de Kerjean
in the neighbourhood of Pondicherry, and took him pri∣soner,
together with fifteen officers: after this success, Mr.
Clive reduced the forts of Covelong and Chengalput, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
last very strong, situated about forty miles to the south<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
ward of Madras. On the other hand, M. Dupleix inter∣cepted
at sea Captain Schaub, with his whole Swiss compa∣ny,
whom he detained prisoners at Pondicherry, althoug<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the two nations were not at war with each other. Durin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
these transactions Sallabatzing, with a body of French un∣der
M. de Bussy, advanced towards Aurengabad, which
was the seat of government; but he was opposed by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
chief of the Mahrattas, at the head of a numerous army. I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the mean time, Gawzedy Khan, the elder brother of Sal∣labatzing,
whom the Mogul had appointed viceroy of De<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>can, took possession of his government at Aurengabad
where, in fourteen days after his arrival, he was poisone<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
by his own sister. The Mogul immediately appointed hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
son Schah Abadin Khan to succeed his father; and thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
prince actually raised an army to come and take possession<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
but the Mogul's affairs requiring his presence at Delhi, h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was obliged to postpone his design, so that Sallabatzing wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
left without a competitor, and made a present to the Frenc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of all the English settlements to the northward. Thu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
concluded the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty
two. Next campaign was chiefly confined to the neigh∣bourhood
of Trichinopoly, where Major Laurence mad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
several vigorous attacks upon the enemy's army, and ob∣tained
many advantages, which, however, did not prov<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
decisive, because he was so much out-numbered that h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
could never follow his blow.</P>
<P>§ XXV. In the course of this year, the Mogul was de∣posed
by his general Schah Abadin Khan, the viceroy o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Decan, who raised to the throne Allum Geer, another
prince of the blood. In the succeeding year, a negocia∣tion
was set on foot by Mr. Saunders, governor of Ma∣dras,
and M. Dupleix, and conferences were opened a
Sadrass, a Dutch settlement between Pondicherry and For
<PB N="379" REF="387"/>
St. George: but this proved abortive; and many other
gallant efforts were made by Major Laurence in the terri∣tory
of Trichinopoly, which still continued to be the scene
of action. In the course of this year Admiral Watson ar∣rived
on the coast of Coromandel with a squadron of ships
of war, having on board a regiment commanded by Colonel
Aldercroon: at the same time the ships from France
brought over to Pondicherry the Sieur Godeheu, com∣missary
general and governor-general of all their settle∣ments,
at whose arrival Dupleix departed for Europe. The
new governor immediately wrote a letter to Mr. Saunders,
professing the most pacifick inclinations, and proposing a
suspension of arms between the two companies, until their
disputes could be amicably adjusted. This proposal was
very agreeable to the governor and council at Madras, and
a cessation of arms actually took place in the month of
October, in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-four.
Deputies being sent to Pondicherry, a provisional
treaty and truce were concluded, on condition that neither
of the two companies should for the future interfere in
any difference that might rise between the princes of the
country. The other articles related to the places and set∣tlements
that should be retained or possessed by the re∣spective
companies, until fresh orders relating to this
agreement should arrive from the courts of London and
Versailles, transmitted by the two East-India companies
of France and England. Until such orders should arrive,
it was stipulated that neither nation should be allowed to
procure any new grant or cession, or to build <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orts for the
defence of new establishments; and that they should not
proceed to any cession, retrocession, or evacuation of
what they then possessed; but every thing should remain
on the footing of <HI>uti possidetis.</HI> How pacifick soever the
sentiments of the French subjects might have been at this
period in the East-Indies, certain it is, the designs of the
French governors in America were altogether hostile, and
their conduct hastening towards a rupture, which kindled
up a bloody war in every division of the globe.</P>
<P><PB N="380" REF="388"/>
§ XXVI. As this war may be termed a native of Ame∣rica,
and the principal scenes of it were acted on that con∣tinent,
we shall, for the information of the reader, sketch
out the situation of the then British colonies as they border∣ed
on each other, and extended along the sea-coast, from
the gulf of St. Laurence as far south as the country
of Florida. We shall enumerate the Indian nations that
lie scattered about their confines, and delineate the man∣ner
in which the French hemmed them in by a surprising
line of fortifications. Should we comprehend Hudson's-Bay,
with the adjacent countries, and the banks of New-foundland,
in this geographical detail, we might affirm
that Great-Britain at that time possessed a territory along
the sea-coast, extending seventeen hundred miles in a direct
line, from the sixtieth to the thirty-first degree of northern
latitude: but as these two countries were not concerned
in this dispute, we shall advance from the northward to the
southern side of the gulf of St. Laurence; and beginning
with Acadia or Nova-Scotia, describe our settlements, as
they lie in a southerly direction, as far as the gulf of Flo∣rida.
This great tract of country, stretching fifteen degrees
of latitude, is washed on the east by the Atlantick ocean:
the southern boundary is Spanish Florida; but to the west∣ward
the limits are uncertain, some affirming that the ju∣risdiction
of the colonies penetrates through the whole con∣tinent,
as far as the South-Sea; while others, with more
moderation, think they are naturally bounded by the river
Illionois that runs into the Mississippi, and in a manner con∣nects
that river with the chain of lakes known by the
names of Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario, the three
first communicating with each other, and the last dis∣charging
itself into the river St. Laurence, which running
by Montreal and Quebeck issues into the bay of the same
denomination, forming the northern boundary of Nova-Scotia.
The French, who had no legal claim to any
lands on the south side of this river, nevertheless, with an
insolence of ambition peculiar to themselves, not only ex∣tended
their forts from the source of the St. Laurence,
<PB N="381" REF="389"/>
through an immense tract of country, as far as the Mis∣sissippi,
which disembogues itself into the gulf of Florida;
but also, by a series of unparalleled encroachments, endea∣voured
to contract the English colonies within such nar∣row
limits as would have cut off almost one half of their
possessions. As we have already given a geographical de∣scription
of Nova-Scotia, and mentioned the particulars of
the new settlement of Halifax, we shall now only observe,
that it is surrounded on three sides by the sea, the gulf, and
river of St. Laurance; that its original boundary to the
west was the river Pentagoet; but it is now contracted
within the river St. Croix, because the crown of Great-Britain
did, in the year one thousand six hundred and sixty-three,
grant to the Duke of York the territory of Sagada∣hack,
stretching from St. Croix to the river of this name;
which was in the sequel, by an express charter from the
crown, annexed to the province of Massachusett's-Bay,
one of the four governments of New-England. This
country, situated next to Nova-Scotia, lies between the
forty-first and forty-fifth degrees of north latitude, extend∣ing
near three hundred miles in length, and about two hun∣dred
in breadth, if we bound it by those tracts which the
French possessed: no part of the settlements of this country,
however, stretches above sixty miles from the sea. The
summer is here intensely hot, and the winter proportion∣ably
severe: nevertheless, the climate is healthy, and the
sky generally serene. The soil is not favourable to any of
the European kinds of grain; but produces great plenty of
maiz, which the people bake into bread, and brew into
beer, though their favourite drink is made of melasses hop∣ped,
and impregnated with the tops of the spruce-fir, which
is a native of this country. The ground raises good flax
and tolerable hemp. Here are great herds of black cattle,
some of them very large in size, a vast number of excellent
hogs, a breeds of small horses, graceful, swift, and hardy;
and large flocks of sheep, whose wool, though not so fine
as that of England, is manufactured with great success.</P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="390"/>
§ XXVII. New-England is composed of the four pro∣vinces
known by the names of New-Hampshire, Massach<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
sett's-Bay, Rhode-Island, and Connecticut. It is bound∣ed
on the south by New-York, extending northerly, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
both sides of the river Hudson, about two hundred mile
into the country possessed by the Indians of the Five Na∣tions,
whom the French distinguish by the name of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Irroquois; but in breadth this province does not exceed
fifty miles, though it comprehends Long-Island, lying to
the southward of Connecticut. The capital, which derive
from the province the name of New-York, is situated o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
an excellent harbour in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sland of Manahatton, extend∣ing
fourteen miles in length, and five in breadth, at the
mouth of the noble river Hudson, which is navigable for
above two hundred miles. At the distance of one hundred
and fifty miles from New-York stands the town of Albany,
upon the same river. In this place all the treaties and
other transactions are negociated between the English and
the Irroquois, a confederacy of five Indian nations, who,
by their union, courage, and military skill, had reduced a
great number of other Indian tribes, and subdued a terri∣tory
more extensive than the whole kingdom of France.
They were about fourscore years ago able to bring ten
thousand warriors into the field; but now their number is so
greatly diminished by wars, epidemical diseases, and the use
of spirituous liquors, that they cannot raise above fifteen
hundred men, even though they have admitted into their
confederacy the nation of the Tuscaroras, whom the Eng∣lish
drove from the confines of Carolina. The Mohok
Indians inhabit the country advanced from Albany. The
northern extremities of New-Hampshire and New-York are
divided by the lakes Champlain and Sacrament, between
which the French had raised the fort of Crown-Point.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. Contiguous to New-York, and lying along
the coast, in a southerly direction, is the small province of
New-Jersey, bounded on the west by the river Delaware,
which divides it from Pennsylvania, extending about
one hundred and fifty miles in length, but in breadth not
<PB N="383" REF="391"/>
more than one third part of that extent. The climate, soil
and produce of these two provinces, as well as of Penn∣sylvania,
are similar. They yield great quantities of grain,
sheep, horses, hogs, and horned cattle; all kinds of poul∣try
and game in great abundance; vegetables of every
sort in perfection, and excellent fruit, particularly peaches
and melons. Their vast forests abound with oak, ash,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eech, chesnut, cedar, walnut-tree, cypress, hickery, sass∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ras,
and pine; but the timber is not counted so fit for
shipping as that of New-England and Nova-Scotia. These
provinces produce great quantities of flax and hemp.
Ne-York affords mines of iron, and very rich copper
ore is found in New-Jersey.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. Pennsylvania, lying to the southward of New-York
and New-Jersey, is bounded on the other side by
Maryland, stretching two hundred and fifty miles in length,
two hundred in breadth, and having no communication
with the sea, except by the mouth of the river Delaware.
This province was originally settled by quakers, under the
auspices of the celebrated William Penn, whose descen∣dants
are still proprietaries of the country. Philadel∣phia,
the capital, stands on a tongue of land, at the con∣fluence
of two navigable rivers, the Delaware and the
Schulkel, disposed in the form of a regular oblong, and
designed by the original plan to extend from the one to
the other. The streets, which are broad, spacious, and
uniform, cross each other at right angles, leaving proper
spaces for churches, markets, and other publick edifices.
The houses are neatly built of brick, the quays spacious
and magnificent, the warehouses large and numerous, and
the docks commodious and well contrived for ship-building.
Pennsylvania is understood to extend as far northerly as
the banks of the lake Erie, where the French erected a fort.
They also raised another at some distance to the south∣ward
of the Riviere-au-Beuf, and made other encroach∣ments
on this colony.</P>
<P>§ XXX. Adjoining to part of Pennsylvania, on the sea
coast, lies the province of Maryland, a tract of land situated
<PB N="384" REF="392"/>
along the bay of Chesapeak, in length about one hundred
and forty miles, and nearly of the same breadth, bounded
on the north by Pennsylvania, on the east by the Atlantick
ocean, and by the river Potowmack on the south. This
country was first planted with Roman catholicks by Lord
Baltimore, to whom Charles II. granted it by patent. In
the sequel, however, people of all religions were admitted
into this settlement, and indulged with liberty of conscience,
and at present the reigning religion is that of the English
church. The climate is very sultry in summer, and not
very salubrious. The soil is fruitful, and produces a great
quantity of tobacco, which the people cultivate as their
staple commodity. The seat of government is established
at Annapolis, a small town beautifully situated on the river
Patuxent.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. Tracing the sea-coast still southerly, the next
settlement is Virginia, watered on the north by the river
Potowmack, which is the boundary between this and the
colony last described, having the bay of Chesapeak to the
east, bounded on the south by Carolina, and extending
westward without any prescribed limits, though the planta∣tions
have reached no farther than the great Allegany
mountains; so that the province, as now possessed, stretches
in length about two hundred and forty miles, and in breadth
not above two hundred, lying between the fifty-fifth and
fortieth degrees of latitude. In sailing to Virginia, naviga∣tors
steer through a straight formed by two points, called
the Capes, into the bay of Chesapeak, a large inlet that
runs three hundred miles into the country from south to
north, covered from the Atlantick ocean by the eastern
side of Maryland, and a small portion of Virginia on the
same peninsula. This noble bay is about eighteen miles
broad for a considerable space, and seven at its narrowest
part, yielding generally nine fathoms depth of water; on
both sides it receives many navigable rivers, those on the
Virginia side being known by the names of James-river,
York-river, the Rappahannock, and Potowmack. This
country, especially towards the sea, lies very low and swampy,
<PB N="385" REF="393"/>
and the soil is extremely fertile. The air and weather
are variable, the heats of summer excessive, the frosts of
winter sudden, and intensely cold; so that, upon the whole,
the climate is neither very agreeable nor healthy, the peo∣ple
being particularly subject to agues and pleuretick dis∣orders.
The province abounds with vast forests of timber:
the plains are covered with a surprising luxuriancy of ve∣getables,
flowers, and flowering shrubs, diffusing the most
delicious fragrance. The ground yields plenty of corn,
and every sort of fruit in great abundance and perfection.
Horned cattle and hogs have here multiplied to admiration
since they were first imported from Europe. The animals,
natives of this and the neighbouring countries, are deer,
panthers or tigers, bears, wolves, foxes, squirrels, racoons,
and creatures called opossums, with an infinite variety of
beautiful birds, and a diversity of serpents, among which
the rattlesnake is the most remarkable.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. Virginia is bounded to the south by the two
Carolinas, situated between the forty-sixth and thirty-first
degrees of latitude; the length amounting to upwards
of four hundred miles, and the breadth extending near
three hundred, as far as the Indian nations called the Ca∣tawbas,
the Creeks, and Cherokees. The country of
Carolina is divided into two governments, of which the
most northern is the most inconsiderable. The climate in
both is the same, as well as the soil: the first is warm,
though not unhealthy; the last extremely fertile, yielding
every thing in plenty which is produced in Virginia, be∣sides
abundance of excellent oranges, and some commodi∣ties
which are not found to the northward. North Caro∣lina,
though not so opulent, is more populous than the
southern part. The colonists of North-Carolina carry on
a considerable traffick in tar, pitch, turpentine, staves,
shingles, lumber, corn, peas, pork, and beef, tobacco,
deer-skins, indigo, wheat, rice, bees-wax, tallow, bacon,
and hog's lard, cotton, and squared timber, live cattle,
with the skins of beaver, racoon, fox, minx, wild cat, and
otter. South-Carolina is much better cultivated; the
<PB N="386" REF="394"/>
people are more civilized, and the commerce more impor∣tant.
The capital of this province, called Charles-Town,
is finely situated at the confluence of two navigable rivers,
having the advantage of a commodious harbour. Their
trade, exclusive of the articles we have already mentioned
as common to this government and that of North-Caro∣lina,
consists of two chief staple commodities, rice and in∣digo,
which they cultivate with great success; and they
have likewise made some progress in the culture of silk.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. The most southern of all our settlements
on this coast is Georgia, extending about sixty miles from
north to south, along the sea-shore; but widening in the
inland parts to above one hundred and fifty, and stretching
almost three hundred from the sea to the Apalachian moun∣tains.
This country differs very little from that of South-Carolina,
with which it borders; yet the summer is here
more hot, and the soil not so fertile. Savannah, the capi∣tal,
stands commodiously for trade, about ten miles from
the sea, on a river of the same name, navigable with large
boats two hundred miles farther up to the second town,
called Augusta, a place that flourishes by the Indian trade
of skins, which the inhabitants carry on with their neigh∣bours
the Creeks, the Chickesaws, and the Cherokees,
who are the most numerous and powerful tribes in America.
Georgia is bounded on the south by the river A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>amaha,
at no great distance from the Spanish fort of St. Augustin.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. Having thus exhibited a succinct view of the
British colonies in North-America, for the information of
the reader, we shall now resume the thread of our history,
and particularise the transactions by which the present year
was distinguished on this extensive continent. The go∣vernment
of England having received nothing but evasive
answers from the court of France, touching the complaints
that were made of the encroachments in America, dispatched
orders to all the governors of that country to repel force by
force, and drive the French from their settlements on the
river Ohio. Accordingly, the provinces of Virginia and
Pennsylvania took this important affair into their consider∣ation;
<PB N="387" REF="395"/>
but, while they deliberated, the French vigorously
prosecuted their designs on the other side of the mountains.
They surprised Logs-town, which the Virginians had
built upon the Ohio; made themselves masters of the
Block-house and Truck-house, where they found skins
and other commodities to the amount of twenty thousand
pounds, and destroyed all the British traders, except two
who found means to escape. At the same time, M. de
Contrecoeur, with a thousand men, and eighteen pieces of
cannon, arrived in three hundred canoes from Venango, a
fort they had raised on the banks of the Ohio, and reduced
by surprise a British fort which the Virginians had built
on the forks of the Monangahela, that runs into the same
river.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. These hostilities were followed by divers
skirmishes between the people of the two nations, which
were fought with various success. At length the govern∣nors
of the English settlements received orders from En∣gland
to form a political confederacy, for their mutual
defence: and the governor of New-York was directed to
confer with the chiefs of the Six Nations, with a view to
detach them from the French interest by dint of promises
and presents of value, sent over for that purpose. A con∣gress
was accordingly appointed at Albany, to which
place the governor of New-York repaired, accompanied
by commissioners from all the other British settlements:
but a very small number of Indians arrived, and even these
seemed to be indifferent to the advances and exhortations
that were made by the English orator. The truth is, the
French had artfully weaned them from their attachment to
the subjects of Great-Britain. Nevertheless, they accept∣ed
the presents, renewed their treaties with the King of
England, and even demanded his assistance in driving the
French from the posts and possessions they had usurped
within the Indian territories. It was in consequence of
the measures here taken, that Colonel Washington was de∣tached
from Virginia with four hundred men, and occu∣pied
a post on the banks of the river Ohio, where he
<PB N="388" REF="396"/>
threw up some works, and erected a kind of occasional
fort, in hopes of being able to defend himself in that situ∣ation,
until he should be joined by a re-enforcement from
New-York, which, however, did not arrive.</P>
<P>§ XXXVI. While he remained in this situation, De
Viller, a French commander, at the head of nine hun∣dred
men, being on his march to dislodge Washington,
detached one Jamonville, an inferior officer, with a small
party, and a formal summons to Colonel Washington,
requiring him to quit the fort, which he pretended was
built on ground belonging to the French, or their allies.
So little regard was paid to this intimation, that the Eng∣lish
fell upon this party, and, as the French affirm,
without the least provocation, either slew or took the whole
detachment. De Viller, incensed at these unprovoked
hostilities, marched up to the attack, which Washington
for some time sustained under manifold disadvantages. At
length, however, he surrendered the fort upon capitulation,
for the performance of which he left two officers as hostages
in the hands of the French; and in his retreat was terri∣bly
harrassed by the Indians, who plundered his baggage,
and massacred his people. This event was no sooner
known in England, than the British ambassador at Paris
received directions to complain of it to the French mini∣stry,
as an open violation of the peace; but this repre∣sentation
had no effect.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. Both nations by this time foresaw that a
rupture would be inevitable, and each resolved to make
suitable preparations. France continued to send re-en∣forcements
of men, and supplies of ammunition to Que∣beck,
for the prosecution of her ambitious projects; and
the ministry of Great-Britain transmitted salutary cautions
to the governors of the provinces in North-America, ex∣horting
them to join their endeavours for repelling the in∣cursions
of the enemy. Such an union as seemed neces∣sary
for their common preservation was not easily effected.
The different colonies were divided by different views and
interests, both religious and political: besides, every set∣tlement
<PB N="389" REF="397"/>
was distracted into factions, formed by the gover∣nor
and the demagogues of the assembly: in other words,
an opposition like that in parliament, and a continual
struggle between the liberties of the people and the prero∣gative
of the proprietor, whether sovereign or subject.
Mr. Dinwiddie, governor of Virginia, having demanded
a certain perquisite or fee for every patent he should pass
for land, the assembly voted his demand illegal, arbitrary,
and oppressive. They declared, that every man who paid
it should be deemed an enemy to his country, and sent
over an agent to London, to sollicit the suppression of this
imposition. The representatives of the people in Pennsyl∣vania
wasted the time in vain deliberations and violent dis∣putes
with their proprietaries, while the enemy infested
their frontiers. The colony of New-York was filled with
discontent and animosity. Sir Danvers Osborn, who had
been appointed governor of this province, died immediately
after his arrival at New-York, and the instructions he had
received were exposed to publick censure. The preamble
inveighed severely against the want of duty, allegiance,
loyalty, and unanimity which had lately appeared so
notorious in the assembly of that province, who had vio∣lated
the royal commission and instructions, by assuming
to themselves the power to dispose of publick money in the
laws which they had occasionally passed. This gentle∣man
was, therefore, directed to insist upon the reformation
of all those publick abuses, and upon the establishment of
a certain supply for the service of the government, as well
as upon the settlement of a salary for himself. Moreover,
his Majesty, in these instructions, signified his will and
pleasure, That all money raised for the supply and support
of government, or upon any emergency for immediate
service, should be disposed of and applied properly to the
use for which it might be granted, by warrant from the
governor, by and with the advice and consent of the coun∣cil
of the province, and no otherwise: That, neverthe∣less,
the assembly should be permitted, from time to time,
to view and examine the accounts of money disposed of, by
<PB N="390" REF="398"/>
virtue of laws which they had enacted: That if any
member of the council, or officer holding place of trust or
profit within the government, should, in any manner
whatever, give his assent to, or in any wise advise or con∣cur
with the assembly in passing any act or vote, whereby
the royal prerogative might be lessened or impaired, or any
money be raised or disposed of for the publick service, con∣trary
to or inconsistent with the method prescribed by
these instructions, the governor should forthwith remove
or suspend such counsellor or officer so offending, and give
an immediate account of his proceedings to the commission∣ers
of trade and plantations. These were peremptory in∣junctions,
which plainly proved that the ministry was de∣termined
to support the prerogative with a high hand;
but it must be owned, at the same time, that abundance of
provocation had been given, by the insolent opposition of
some turbulent individuals, who had exerted all their in∣fluence
in disturbing and distressing the views and designs
of the government. While the British colonies in Ame∣rica
were, by these divisions, in a great measure disabled
from making vigorous efforts against the common enemy,
the administration at home began to exert it self for their
defence. Officers were appointed for two regiments, con∣sisting
of two battalions each, to be raised in America,
and commanded by Sir William Pepperel and Governor
Shirley, who had enjoyed the same command in the last
war; and a body of troops was destined for the same ser∣vice.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. The most remarkable incident that mark∣ed
this year on the continent of Europe was the conver∣sion
of the Hereditary Prince of Hesse Cassel, who had
espoused the Princess Mary of England. He now de∣clared
himself a Roman Catholick, and was supposed to
have been cajoled to this profession by the promises of cer∣tain
powers, who flattered his ambition, in order to weak∣en
the protestant interest in Germany. His father,
though deeply affected by his son's apostacy, did not sail to
take immediate measures for preventing the evil consequences
<PB N="391" REF="399"/>
which might otherwise have flowed from his defection.
He forthwith assembled the states of the landgraviate, in
order to take such measures as might appear necessary to
maintain the religion, laws, and constitution of the coun∣try;
and the prince was laid under certain restrictions,
which he did not find it an easy talk to set aside. It was
enacted, that when the regency should devolve to him by
succession he should not have it in his power to alter the
established laws, or grant any church to persons of the
Roman communion, for the publick exercise of their re∣ligion;
and that he should be excluded from all share in
the education of his sons, the eldest of whom should be
put in possession of the country of Hanau upon his father's
accession to the regency of the landgraviate. These reso∣lutions
were guarantied by the Kings of Prussia and Den∣mark,
by the Maritime Powers, and the Evangelick Body
of the empire.</P>
<P>§ XXXIX. The exile of the parliament of Paris, far
from having intimidated the other tribunals from perform∣ing
what they apprehended to be their duty, served only
to inflame the discontents of the people, and to animate
all the courts of justice to a full exertion of their authority.
The chatelet continued to prosecute those priests who re∣fused
the sacrament to persons whose consciences would
not allow them to subscribe to the bull Unigenitus, even
after three of their members were sent to the Bastile. The
same prosecutions were carried on, and bold remonstrances
published by the parliaments of Aix and Rouen. In a
word, the whole kingdom was filled with such confusion
as threatened a total suppression of justice, in a general
spirit of disaffection, and universal anarchy. The pre∣lates,
mean while, seemed to triumph in the combustion
they had raised. They entered into associations to support
each other; they intrigued at court, and harrassed the
King with insolent declarations, till he grew tired of their
proceedings, and opened his eyes to the fatal consequences
of their pride and obstinacy. He even took an opportunity
of exhorting the Archbishop of Paris to act more suitably
<PB N="392" REF="400"/>
to the character of a clergyman. He recalled the parliament
from exile, and they returned in triumph, amidst the ac∣clamations
of the people, who celebrated their arrival at
Paris with the most extravagant demonstrations of joy;
and the archbishop, notwithstanding the King's express
declaration to the contrary, still persisting in countenan∣cing
the recusant priests, was banished to Conflans-sous-Charenton.</P>
<P>§ XL. In Spain the interest of Great-Britain was so warm∣ly
espoused, and so powerfully supported by Mr. Wall,
who had been resident in England, that the French party,
though countenanced by the Queen-mother, and sustained
with all the influence of the Marquis de la Ensenada, the
prime minister, was totally defeated. The King being
convinced that it would be for the interest of his subjects
to live on good terms with England, and well apprised of
Ensenada's intrigues, ordered that minister to be arrested
and confined, and bestowed upon Mr. Wall the best part
of his employments. Nevertheless, the Spaniards in the
West-Indies continued to oppress the subjects of Great-Britain
employed in cutting logwood in the bay of Hondu∣ras;
and representations on this head being made to the
court of Madrid, the dispute was amicably adjusted between
Mr. Wall and Sir Benjamin Keene, the British ambassador.
While the interest of Britain thus triumphed in Spain, it
seemed to lose ground at the court of Lisbon. His Portu∣gnese
Majesty had formed vast projects of an active com∣merce,
and even established an East-India company: in
the mean time he could not help manifesting his chagrin at
the great quantities of gold which were yearly exported
from his dominions, as the balance due from his subjects
on English commodities. In his endeavours to check this
traffick, which he deemed so detrimental to his subjects, he
inflicted hardships on the British merchants settled at
Lisbon: some were imprisoned on frivolous pretences;
others deprived of their property, and obliged to quit the
kingdom. He insisted upon laying an imposition of two
per cent. on all the Portuguese gold that should be ex∣ported;
<PB N="393" REF="401"/>
but the profits of the trade would not bear such an
exaction. Mean while, there being a scarcity of corn in
Portugal, the kingdom was supplied from England; and
the people having nothing but gold to purchase this ne∣cessary
supply, the King saw the necessity of conniving at
the exportation of his coin, and the trade reverted into its
former channel.</P>
<P>§ XLI. On the fourteenth day of November the King
of Great-Britain opened the session of parliament with an
harangue, which intimated nothing of an approaching
rupture. He said, That the general state of affairs in
Europe had undergone very little alteration since their last
meeting; that he had lately received the strongest assuran∣ces
from his good brother the King of Spain of friendship
and confidence, which he would cultivate with harmony
and good faith. He declared his principal view should be
to strengthen the foundation, and secure the duration of a
general peace; to improve the present advantages of it for
promoting the trade of his good subjects, and protecting
those possessions which constituted one great source of their
wealth and commerce. Finally, he exhorted them to
complete their plan for appropriating the forfeited estates
in the Highlands to the service of the publick. He pro∣bably
avoided mentioning the encroachments of France,
that he might supply no handle for debates on the address,
which was carried in both Houses almost without oppo∣sition.
The government seemed determined to humble
the insolence of the French councils; and this disposition
was so agreeable to the people in general, that they grudg∣ed
no expense, and heartily concurred with the demands
of the ministry.</P>
<P>§ XLII. The Commons granted for the service of the
ensuing year four millions seventy-three thousand seven
hundred and twenty-nine pounds; one million of that sum
expressly given for enabling his Majesty to augment his
forces by land and sea. Thirty-two thousand pounds were
allotted as a subsidy to the King of Poland, and twenty
thousand to the Elector of Bavaria. These gratifications
<PB N="394" REF="402"/>
met with little or no opposition in the committee of supply;
because it was taken for granted, that, in case of a rupture,
France would endeavour to avail herself of her superiority
by land, by invading his Britannick Majesty's German
dominions; and therefore it might be necessary to secure
the assistance of such allies on the continent. That they
prognosticated aright, with respect to the designs of that
ambitious power, will soon appear in the course of this
history; which will also demonstrate how little dependence
is to be placed upon the professed attachment of subsidiary
princes. The supplies were raised by the standing
branches of the revenue, the land tax and malt tax, and a
lottery for one million; one hundred thousand pounds of
it to be deducted for the service of the publick, and the
remaining nine hundred thousand to be charged on the
produce of the sinking fund, at the rate of three per cent.
per annum, to commence from the fifth day of January
in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-six. The
civil transactions of this session were confined to a few ob∣jects.
Divers new regulations were made for encouraging
and improving the whale and white herring fishery, as well
as for finishing and putting in a proper state of defence a
new fort, lately built at Anamaboc on the coast of Africa.</P>
<P>§ XLIII. Mr. Pitt, the paymaster-general of the forces,
brought in a bill, which will ever remain a standing monu∣ment
of his humanity. The poor disabled veterans, who
enjoyed the pension of Chelsea hospital, were so iniqui∣tously
oppressed by a set of miscreants, who supplied them
with money per advance, at the most exorbitant rates of
usury, that many of them, with their families, were in
danger of starving; and the intention of government in
granting such a comfortable subsistence was in a great
measure defeated. Mr. Pitt, perceiving that this evil
originally flowed from the delay of the first payment, which
the pensioner could not touch till the expiration of a
whole year after he had been put upon the list, removed
this necessity of borrowing, by providing in the bill, that
half a year's pension should be advanced half a year before
<PB N="395" REF="403"/>
it is due; and the practice of usury was effectually prevented
by a clause, enacting, that all contracts should be void by
which any pension might be mortgaged. This humane
regulation was unanimously approved, and having passed
through both Houses with uncommon expedition, received
the royal assent.</P>
<P>§ XLIV. Notwithstanding the unanimity manifested
by the Commons, in every thing relating to the mea∣sures
for acting vigorously against the common enemy of
the nation, they were remarkably disturbed and divided by
a contested election of members for Oxfordshire. In the
course of this dispute, the strength and influence of what
they called the old and new interest, or, to speak more in∣telligibly,
of the Tories and Whigs in that county, were
fully displayed. The candidates sustained on the shoulders
of the old interest, were Lord Viscount Wenman and
Sir James Dashwood: their competitors, whom the new
interest supported, and of consequence the ministry coun∣tenanced,
were Lord Parker and Sir Edward Turner.
Never was any contention of this kind maintained with
more spirit and animosity, or carried on at a greater expense.
One would have imagined that each side considered it as a
dispute which must have determined, whether the nation
should enjoy its ancient liberty, or tamely submit to the
setters of corruption. Noblemen and gentlemen, clergy-men
and ladies, employed all their talents and industry in
canvassing for either side, throughout every township and
village in the county. Scandal emptied her whole quiver
of insinuation, calumny, and lampoon; corruption was
not remiss in promises and presents: houses of entertain∣ment
were opened; and nothing was for some time to be
seen but scenes of tumult, riot, and intoxication. The
revenue of many an independent prince on the con∣tinent
would not have been sufficient to afford such sums
of money as were expended in the course of this dispute.
At length they proceeded to election, and the sheriff made
a double return of all the four candidates, so that not one
of them could sit, and the county remained without a re∣presentative
<PB N="396" REF="404"/>
presentative until this ambiguous affair could be decided
in the House of Commons. About the middle of Novem∣ber
petitions being presented by the four candidates, as
well as by the gentlemen, clergy, and other freeholders of
the county, complaining of an undue election, and double
return, the matter of these petitions was heard at the bar
of the House on the third day of December. The counsel
for Lord Wenman and Sir James Dash wood alledged, that
they had the majority of votes upon the poll, and this cir∣cumstance
was admitted by the counsel on the other side:
then they proceeded to prove by evidence, that, after closing
the poll, the sheriff declared the majority of votes to be in
favour of these two candidates, and adjourned the court
from the twenty-third day of April to the eighth of May;
so that the scrutiny demanded, and granted on the behalf of
Lord Parker and Sir Edward Turner could not be discussed
before the last day of the month, when the writ was re∣turnable;
that the scrutiny did not begin till the ninth
day of May, when the time was protracted by disputes
about the manner in which it should be carried on; that
Lord Parker and Sir Edward Turner were allowed to ob∣ject,
through the whole poll, to the votes on the other
side, on pretence that their competitors should be permitted
to answer these objections, and, in their turn, object through
the whole poll to the voters for Lord Parker and Sir Ed∣ward
Turner, who should, in the last place, have leave
to answer: that Lord Wenman and Sir James Dashwood
had disapproved of this method, because they apprehended
it might induce their competitors to make such a number of
frivolous objections, that they should not have time to
answer one half of them, much less to make objections of
their own before the writ should be returned: that they
foresaw such a number of frivolous objections were made,
as engrossed the attention of the court till the twenty-seventh
day of May; so that they could not begin to an∣swer
any of these objections till the twenty-eighth; and on
the thirtieth the sheriff, having closed the scrutiny, made
the double return. The proof being exhibited, the coun∣sel
<PB N="397" REF="405"/>
insisted, that, as they had established a majority on the
poll, and demonstrated that this majority neither was nor
could be overthrown by such an unfinished scrutiny, it
was incumbent on the other side to proceed upon the merits
of the election, by endeavouring to overthrow that ma∣jority
of which their clients were in possession. A question
in the House being carried to the same purpose, Lord Wen∣man
and Sir James Dashwood objected to five hundred
and thirty voters on the other side, whom they proposed to
disqualify. Their counsel examined several witnesses, to
prove the partiality of the sheriff in favour of Lord Parker
and Sir Edward Turner, and to detect these candidates in
the practice of bribery; for which purpose they produced
a letter in their own handwriting. They afterwards
proceeded to disqualify particular votes, and summed up
their evidence on the twenty-first day of January.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> Then
the counsel for the other side began to refute the charge of
partiality and corruption; and to answer the objections
that had been made to particular voters. They produced
evidence to prove, that customary freeholds, or customary
holdings, had voted at elections in the counties of Glamor∣gan,
Monmouth, Gloucester, Wells, and Hereford; and
that the customary tenants of the manor of Woodstock, in
Oxfordshire, had been reputed capable of voting, and even
voted at elections for that county. In a word, they con∣tinued
to examine evidences, argue and refute, prove and
disprove, until the twenty-third day of April, when, after
some warm debates and divisions in the House, Lord Par∣ker
and Sir Edward Turner were declared duly elected:
and the clerk of the crown was ordered to amend the re∣turn,
by erasing the names of Lord Wenman and Sir
James Dashwood. Many who presumed to think for them∣selves,
without recollecting the power and influence of the
administration, were astonished at the issue of this dispute;
which, however, might have easily been foreseen; inas∣much
as, during the course of the proceedings, most, if
not all, of the many questions debated in the House were
determined by a great majority in favour of the new in∣terest.
<PB N="398" REF="406"/>
A great number of copy-holders had been admitted
to vote at this election,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1755.</NOTE> and the sheriff incurred no censure
for allowing them to take the oath appointed by law to be
taken by freeholders: nevertheless, the Commons carefully
avoided determining the question; Whether copy-holders
possessed of the yearly value of forty shillings, clear of all
deductions, have not a right to vote for knights to repre∣sent
the shire within which their copy-hold estates are
situated? This point being left doubtful by the legislature,
puts it often in the power of the sheriff to return which of
the candidates he pleases to support; for, if the majority of
the voting copy-holders adheres to the interest of his fa∣vourites,
he will admit their votes both on the poll and the
scrutiny; whereas, should they be otherwise disposed, he
will reject them as unqualified. What effect this practice
may have upon the independency of parliament every per∣son
must perceive, who reflects, than in almost all the
counties of England the high sheriffs are annually appoint∣ed
by the minister for the time being.</P>
<P>§ XLV. The attention of the legislature was chiefly
turned upon the conduct of France, which preserved no
medium, but seemed intent upon striking some important
blow, that might serve as a declaration of war. At Brest,
and other ports in that kingdom, the French were employed
in equipping a powerful armament, and made no scruple to
own it was intended for North-America. Towards the
latter end of March Sir Thomas Robinson, secretary of
state, brought a message from the King to the parliament,
intimating, That his Majesty having at the beginning of the
session declared his principal object was to preserve the
publick tranquillity, and at the same time to protect those
possessions which constitute one great source of the com∣merce
and wealth of his kingdom, he now found it ne∣cessary
to acquaint the House of Commons, that the present
situation of affairs made it requisite to augment his forces
by sea and land, and to take such other measures as might
best tend to preserve the general peace of Europe, and to
secure the just rights and possessions of his crown in Ame∣rica,
<PB N="399" REF="407"/>
as well as to repel any attempts whatsoever that might
be made to support or countenance any designs which
should be formed against his Majesty and his kingdoms;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. III. 1755.</NOTE>
and his Majesty doubted not but his faithful Commons, on
whose affection and zeal he entirely relied, would enable
him to make such augmentations, and to take such mea∣sures
for supporting the honour of his crown, and the true
interests of his people, and for the security of his domi∣nions
in the present critical conjuncture, as the exigency of
affairs might require; in doing which his Majesty would
have as much regard to the ease of his good subjects as
should be consistent with their safety and welfare. In an∣swer
to this message a very warm and affectionate address
was presented to his Majesty; and it was on this occasion
that the million was granted for augmenting his forces by
sea and land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ministry having resolved to send a body of forces to America, to act in conjunction with the provincial troops raised on that continent, it be∣came necessary that the mutiny act should be rendered more clear and exten∣sive. When this bill, therefore, fell under consideration, it was improved with a new clause, providing, “That all officers and soldiers of any troops being mustered and in pay, which are or shall be raised in any of the Bri∣tish provinces in America, by authority of the respective governors or go∣vernments thereof, shall, at all times, and in all places, when they happen to join or act in conjunction with his Majesty's British forces, be liable to martial law and discipline, in like manner, to all intents and purposes, as the British forces are and shall be subject to the same trial, penalties, and punishment.”</NOTE> The court of Versailles, notwithstanding
the assiduity and dispatch which they were exerting in
equipping armaments, and embarking troops, for the sup∣port
of their ambitious schemes in America, still continued
to amuse the British ministry with general declarations,
that no hostility was intended, nor the least infringement of
the treaty.</P>
<P>§ XLVI. The Earl of Albemarle, the English ambassa∣dor
at Paris, having lately died in that city, these assur∣ances
were communicated to the court of London by the
Marquis de Mirepoix, who resided in England with the
same character, which he had supported since his first ar∣rival
with equal honour and politeness. On this occasion
he himself was so far imposed upon by the instructions he
<PB N="400" REF="408"/>
had received, that he believed the professions of his court
were sincere, and seriously endeavoured to prevent a rup∣ture
between the two nations. At length, however, their
preparations were so notorious that he began to suspect
the consequence; and the English ministry produced such
proofs of their insincerity and double dealing, that he
seemed to be struck with astonishment and chagrin. He
repaired to France, and upbraided the ministry of Versailles
for having made him the tool of their dissimulation. They
referred him to the King, who ordered him to return to
London, with fresh assurances of his pacifick intentions:
but his practice agreed so ill with his professions, that the
ambassador had scarce obtained an audience to communi∣cate
them, when undoubted intelligence arrived, that a
powerful armament was ready to sail from Brest and Roche∣fort.
The government of Great-Britain, aroused by this
information, immediately took the most expeditious me∣thods
for equipping a squadron; and towards the latter
end of April, Admiral Boscawen sailed with eleven ships
of the line and one frigate, having on board a considerable
number of land-forces, to attend the motions of the ene∣my:
but more certain and particular intelligence arriving
soon after, touching the strength of the French fleet, which
consisted of twenty-five ships of the line, besides frigates
and transports, with a great quantity of warlike stores,
and four thousand regular troops, commanded by the
Baron Dieskau, Admiral Holbourne was detached with
six ships of the line, and one frigate, to re-enforce Mr. Bos∣cawen;
and a great number of capital ships were put in
commission. In the beginning of May the French fleet
commanded by Mr. Macnamara, an officer of Irish ex∣traction,
sailed from Brest, directing his course to North-America;
but, after having proceeded beyond the chop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of the English channel, he returned with nine of the capi∣tal
ships, while the rest of the armament continued their
course, under the direction of M. Bois de la Mothe.</P>
<P>§ XLVII. On the twenty-fifth day of April the King
went to the House of Lords, where, after giving the royal
<PB N="401" REF="409"/>
assent to the bills then depending; for granting a certain
sum out of the sinking-fund, for the relief of insolvent
debtors, for the better regulation of the marine forces on
shore, for the better raising of marines and seamen, and
to several other publick and private bills; his Majesty put
an end to the session of parliament by a speech, in which
he acquainted the two houses, That the zeal they had
shown for supporting the honour, rights, and possessions
of his crown had afforded him the greatest satisfaction:
That his desire to preserve the publick tranquility had
been sincere and uniform: That he had religiously adher∣ed
to the stipulations of the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, and
made it his care not to injure or offend any power whatsoe∣ver;
but that he never could entertain a thought of pur∣chasing
the name of peace at the expense of suffering en∣croachments
upon, or of yielding up, what justly belong∣ed
to Great-Britain, either by ancient possession or by
solemn treaties: That the vigour and firmness of his par∣liament;
on this important occasion, had enabled him to
be prepared for such contingencies as might happen: That
if reasonable and honourable terms of accommodation
could be agreed upon; he would be satisfied, and, at all
events, rely on the justice of his cause, the effectual sup∣port
of his people, and the protection of Divine Provi∣dence.
The parliament was then prorogued to the twen∣ty-seventh
of May.</P>

<P>§ I. WHILST all Europe was in suspense about the
fate of the English and French squadrons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IV. 1755.</NOTE>
preparations for a vigorous sea war were going forward in
England with an unparallelled spirit and success. Still the
French court flattered itself that Great-Britain, out of
tenderness to his Majesty's German dominions, would ab∣stain
from hostilities. Mirepoix continued to have fre∣quent
conferences with the British ministry, who made no
secret that their admirals, particularly Boscawen, had or∣ders
to attack the French ships wherever they should meet
them. On the other hand, Mons. de Mirepoix declared,
That his master would consider the first gun fired at sea
in a hostile manner as a declaration of war. This me∣nance,
far from intimidating the English, animated them
to redouble their preparations for war. The press for
seamen was carried on with extraordinary vigour in all
parts of this kingdom, as well as in Ireland; and great
premiums were given not only by the government, but
also, over and above his Majesty's bounty, by almost
all the considerable cities and towns in England, to such
as should inlist voluntarily for sailors or soldiers. Other
branches of the public service went on with equal alacrity:
and such was the eagerness of the people to lend their
money to the government, that instead of one million,
which was to be raised by way of lottery, three millions
eight hundred and eighty thousand pounds were subscribed
immediately.</P>
<P><PB N="404" REF="412"/>
§ II. The situation of affairs requiring his Majesty to
go to Germany this summer, great apprehensions arose
in the minds of many, lest the French should either in∣tercept
him in his journey, or prevent his return. Earl
Paulet had made a motion in the House of Lords, humbly
to represent to his Majesty, “That it was an article in
the original act of settlement by which the succession of
these kingdoms devolved to his electoral house, that the
King should not go to his foreign dominions without the
consent of parliament; and that this was a principal ar∣ticle
in the compact between the crown and the people:
That though this article was repealed in the late reign,
yet, till of late, it had always been the custom for his
Majesty to acquaint the parliament with his intended de∣parture
to his German dominions, both in regard to the
true sense and spirit of the act that placed him on the
throne, as well as for the paternal kindness of his royal
heart, and the condescension he had been so good to show
his parliament on all occasions; but that his Majesty's de∣claration
of his design to visit his electoral estates had
always come on the last day of a session, when it was too
late for the great constitutional council of the crown to
offer such advice as might otherwise have been expedient
and necessary: That his Majesty's leaving his kingdoms
in a conjuncture so pregnant with distress, so denuncia∣tive
of danger, would not only give the greatest advan∣tage
to such as might be disposed to stir up disaffection and
discontent, and to the constitutional and national enemies
of England; but would also fill his loyal subjects with the
most affecting concern, and most gloomy fears, as well
for their own safety, as for that of their sovereign, whose
invaluable life, at all times of the utmost consequence to
his people, was then infinitely so, by reason of his great
experience, the affection of every one to his royal person,
and the minority of the heir apparent.” Such was the
purport of this motion; but it was not seconded by any
of the other lords.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="413"/>
§ III. The general uneasiness, account of his Ma∣jesty's
departure, was greatly increased by an apprehension
that there would, during his absence, be no good agree∣ment
amongst the regency, which consisted of the follow∣ing
persons: his royal highness William Duke of Cum∣berland;
Thomas Lord Archbishop of Canterbury;
Phillip Earl of Hardwicke, lord high chancellor; John
Earl of Granville, president of the council; Charles
Duke of Marlborough, lord privy-seal; John Duke of
Rutland, steward of the household; Charles Duke of
Grafton, lord chamberlain; Archibald Duke of Argyle;
the Duke of Newcastle, first commissioner of the Trea∣sury;
the Duke of Dorset, master of the horse; the Earl
of Holdernesse, one of the secretaries of state; the Earl
of Rochford, groom of the stole; the Marquis of Har∣tington,
lord-lieutenant of Ireland; Lord Anson, first
commissioner of the Admiralty; Sir Thomas Robinson,
secretary of state; and Henry Fox, Esq, secretary at war.
His Majesty set out from St. James's on the twenty-eighth
of April early in the morning, embarked at Harwich in
the afternoon, landed the next day at Helvoetsluys, and
arrived at Hanover on the second of May.</P>
<P>§ IV. Admiral Boscawen, with eleven ships of the line
and a frigate, having taken on board two regiments at
Plymouth, sailed from thence on the twenty-seventh of
April for the banks of Newfoundland; and, in a few
days after his arrival there, the French fleet from Brest
came to the same station, under the command of M. Bois
de la Mothe. But the thick fogs which prevailed upon
these coasts, especially at that time of the year, kept the
two armaments from seeing each other; and part of the
French squadron escaped up the river St Laurence,
whilst another part of them went round, and got into the
same river though the straits of Belleisle, by a way which
was never known to be attempted before by ships of the
line. However, whilst the English fleet lay off Cape Race,
which is the southernmost point of Newsoundland, and
was thought to be the most proper situation for inter∣cepting
<PB N="406" REF="414"/>
the enemy, two French ships, the Alcide, of
sixty-four guns, and four hundred and eighty men, and
the Lys, pierced for sixty four guns, but mounting only
twenty-two, having eight companies of land forces on
board, being separated from the rest of their fleet in the
fog, fell in with the Dunkirk, Captain Howe, and the
Defiance, Captain Andrews, two sixty gun ships of the
English squadron; and after a smart engagement, which
lasted some hours, and in which Captain (afterwards
Lord) Howe behaved with the greatest skill and intrepidi∣ty,
were both taken, with several considerable officers and
engineers, and about eight thousand pounds in money.
Though the capture of these ships, from which the com∣mencement
of the war may in fact be dated, fell greatly
short of what was hoped for from this expedition; yet
when the news of it reached England, it was of infinite
service to the publick credit of every kind, and animated
the whole nation, who now saw plainly that the govern∣ment
was determined to keep no further measures with
the French, but justly to repel force by force, and put a
stop to their sending more men and arms to invade the pro∣perty
of the English in America, as they had hitherto done
with impunity. The French, who, for some time, did
not even attempt to make reprisals on our shipping, would
gladly have chosen to avoid a war at that time, and to
have continued extending their encroachments on our set∣tlements,
till they had executed thier grand plan of secur∣ing
a communication from the Mississippi to Canada, by
a line of forts, many of which they had already erected.</P>
<P>§ V. Upon the arrival of the news of this action at
Paris, the French ambassador, M. de Mirepoix, was re∣called
from London, and M. de Bussy from Hanover,
where he had just arrived, to attend the King of England
in a publick character. They complained loudly of Bos∣cawen's
attacking the ships, as a breach of national faith:
but it was justly retorted on the part of England, that their
encroachments in America had rendered reprisals both
justifiable and necessary. The resolution of making them
<PB N="407" REF="415"/>
was the effect of mature deliberation in the English council.
The vast increase of the French marine of late years, which
in all probability would soon be employed against Great-Britain,
occasioned an order for making reprisals general
in Europe as well as in America; and that all French
ships, whether outward or homeward bound, should be
stopped, and brought into British ports. To give the greater
weight to these orders, it was resolved to send out those
admirals who had distinguished themselves most towards
the end of the last war. Accordingly, on the twenty-first
of July, Sir Edward Hawke sailed on a cruise to the west∣ward,
with eighteen ships of the line, a frigate, and a
sloop; but, not meeting with the French fleet, these ships
returned to England about the latter end of September and
the beginning of October; on the fourteenth of which
last month another fleet, consisting of twenty-two ships
of the line, two frigates, and two sloops, sailed again on
a cruise to the westward under Admiral Byng, in hopes
of intercepting the French squadron under Duguay, and
likewise that commanded by La Mothe, in case of its
return from America. But this fleet likewise returned to
Spithead on the twenty-second of November, without
having been able to effect any thing, though it was allow∣ed
by all, that the admiral had acted judiciously in the
choice of his stations.</P>
<P>§ VI. While these measures were pursued, for the general
security of the British coasts and trade in Europe, several
new ships of war were begun, and finished with the utmost
expedition, in his Majesty's docks: twelve frigates and
sloops, contracted for in private yards, were completed
by the month of August; and twenty-four ships and twelve
colliers were then taken into the service of the government,
to be fitted out as vessels of war, to carry twenty guns and
one hundred and twenty men each.—In the mean time the
French trade was so annoyed by the English cruisers, that
before the end of this year three hundred of their mer∣chant
ships, many of which, from St. Domingo and Mar∣tinico,
were extremely rich, and eight thousand of their
<PB N="408" REF="416"/>
sailors, were brought into English ports. By these cap∣tures
the British ministry answered many purposes: they
deprived the French of a great body of seamen, and with∣held
from them a very large property, the want of which
greatly distressed their people, and ruined many of their
traders. Their outward-bound merchant ships were in∣sured
at the rate of thirty per cent. whilst the English paid
no more than the common insurance. This intolerable
burthen was felt by all degrees of people amongst them:
their ministry was publickly reviled, even by their parlia∣ments;
and the French name, from being the terrour,
began to be the contempt of Europe. Their uneasiness
was also not a little heightened by new broils between their
King and the parliament of Paris, occasioned by the ob∣stinancy
of the clergy of that kingdom, who seemed de∣termined
to support the church, in all events, against the
secular tribunals, and, as much as possible, to enforce
the observance of the bull Unigenitus, which had long
been the occasion of so many disputes among them. How∣ever,
the parliament continuing firm, and the French
King approving of its conduct, the ecclesiasticks thought
proper to submit for the present; and in their general
assembly this year granted him a free gift of sixteen mil∣lions
of livres, which he demanded of them—a greater sum
than they had ever given before, even in time of war.</P>
<P>§ VII. In the beginning of this year the assembly of
Massachusett's-Bay in New-England passed an act, pro∣hibiting
all correspondence with the French at Louisbourg;
and early in the spring they raised a body of troops, which
was transported to Nova-Scotia, to assist Lieutenant-Go∣vernor
Laurence in driving the French from the encroach∣ments
they had made upon that province. Accordingly,
towards the end of May, the governor sent a large de∣tachment
of troops, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel
Monckton, upon this service; and three frigates
and a sloop were dispatched up the bay of Fundy, under
the command of Captain Rous, to give their assist∣ance
by sea. The troops, upon their arrival at the river
<PB N="409" REF="417"/>
Massaguash, found the passage stopped by a large number of
regular forces, rebel neutrals, or Acadians, and Indians,
four hundred and fifty of whom occupied a block-house,
with cannon mounted on their side of the river; and the
rest were posted within a strong breast-work of timber,
thrown up by way of outwork to the block-house. The
English provincials attacked this place with such spirit,
that the enemy were obliged to fly, and leave them in pos∣session
of the breast-work: then the garrison in the block-house
deserted it, and left the passage of the river free.
From thence Colonel Monckton advanced to the French
fort of Beau-sejour, which he invested as far at least as
the small number of his troops would permit, on the twelfth
of June; and after four days bombardment obliged it to
surrender, though the French had twenty-six pieces of
cannon mounted, and plenty of ammunition, and the
English had not yet placed a single cannon upon their
batteries. The garrison was sent to Louisbourg, on con∣dition
of not bearing arms in America for the space of six
months; and the Acadians, who had joined the French,
were pardoned, in consideration of their having been
forced into that service. Colonel Monckton, after put∣ting
a garrison into this place, and changing its name
to that of Cumberland, the next day attacked and re∣duced
the other French fort upon the river of Gaspereau,
which runs into Bay Verte; where he likewise found a
large quantity of provisions and stores of all kinds, that
being the chief magazine for supplying the French Indians
and Acadians with arms, ammunition, and other neces∣saries.
He then disarmed these last, to the number of
fifteen thousand: aad in the mean time, Captain Rous
with his ships sailed to the mouth of the river St. John,
to attack the new <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort the French had erected there; but
they saved him that trouble, by abandoning it upon his
appearance, after having burst their cannon, blown up
their magazine, and destroyed, as far as they had time,
all the works they had lately raised. The English had
but twenty men killed, and about the same number
<PB N="410" REF="418"/>
wounded, in the whole of this expedition, the success of
which secured the tranquillity of Nova-Scotia.</P>
<P>§ VIII. While the New-Englanders were thus employ∣ed
in reducing the French in Nova-Scotia, preparations
were made in Virginia for attacking them upon the Ohio.
A fort was built, which was likewise called Fort-Cumber∣land,
and a camp formed at Wills's-Creek. On the four∣teenth
of January of this year, Major-General Braddock,
with Colonel Dunbar's and Colonel Halket's regiments of
foot, failed from Cork, in Ireland, for Virginia, where
they all landed safe before the end of February. This
General might consequently have entered upon action
early in the spring, had he not been unfortunately delayed
by the Virgian contractors for the army, who, when he
was ready to march, had neither provided a sufficient quan∣tity
of provisions for his troops, nor a competent number
of carriages for his army. This accident was foreseen by
almost every person who knew any thing of our plantations
upon the continent of America: for the people of Vir∣ginia,
who think of no produce but their tobacco, and do
not raise corn enough even for their own subsistence, be∣ing,
by the nature of their country, well provided with
the conveniency of water conveyance, have but few wheel-carriages,
or beasts of burthen; whereas Pennsylvania,
which abounds in corn, and most other sorts of provisions,
had but little water-carriage, especially in its western settle∣ments,
where its inhabitants have great numbers of carts,
waggons, and horses. Mr. Braddock should, therefore,
certainly, in point of prudence, have landed in Pennsyl∣vania:
the contract for supplying his troops should have
been made with some of the chief planters there, who could
easily have performed their engagements; and if his camp
had been formed near Frank's-town, or somewhere upon
the south-west borders of that province, he would not
have had eighty miles to march from thence to Fort Du
Quesne, instead of an hundred and thirty miles that he had
to advance from Wills's-Creek, where he did encamp,
through roads neither better nor more practicable than the
<PB N="411" REF="419"/>
other would have been. This error, in the very beginning
of the expedition, whether owing to an injudicious prefer∣ence
fondly given to the Virginians in the lucrative job of
supplying these troops, or to any other cause, delayed the
march of the army for some weeks, during which it was
in the utmost distress for necessaries of all kinds; and
would probably have defeated the expedition entirely for
that summer, had not the contractors found means to
procure some assistance from the back settlements of Penn∣sylvania.
But even when these supplies did arrive, they
consisted of only fifteen waggons, and an hundred draft
horses, instead of an hundred and fifty waggons and three
hundred horses, which the Virginian contractors had en∣gaged
to furnish, and the provisions were so bad that they
could not be used. However, some gentlemen in Pennsyl∣vania,
being applied to in this exigency, amply made up
for these deficienoies, and the troops were by this means
supplied with every thing they wanted. Another, and
still more fatal, error was committed in the choice of the
commander for this expedition. Major-General Braddock,
who was appointed to it, was undoubtedly a man of cou∣rage,
and expert in all the punctilions of a review, having
been brought up in the English guards; but he was na∣turally
very haughty, positive, and difficult of access;
qualities ill suited to the temper of the people amongst
whom he was to command. His extreme severity in mat∣ters
of discipline had rendered him unpopular among the
soldiers; and the strict military education in which he had
been trained from his youth, and which he prided himself
or scrupulously following, made him hold the American
militia in great contempt, because they could not go
through their exercise with the same dexterity and regu∣larity
as a regiment of guards in Hyde-Park, little know∣ing,
or indeed being able to form any idea of the difference
between the European manner of fighting, and an American
expedition through woods, deserts, and morasses. Before
he left England, he received, in the hand-writing of Col.
Napier, a set of instructions from the Duke of Cumberland.
<PB N="412" REF="420"/>
By these, the attempt upon Niagara was, in a great mea∣sure,
referred to him; and the reduction of Crown-Point
was to be left chiefly to the provincial forces. But above
all, his Royal Highness, both verbally and in this writing,
frequently cautioned him carefully to beware of an ambush
or surprise. Instead of regarding this salutary caution, his
conceit of his own abilities made him disdain to ask the
opinion of any under his command; and the Indians, who
would have been his safest guards against this danger in
particular, were so disgusted by the haughtiness of his beha∣viour,
that most of them forsook his banners. Under these
disadvantages he began his march from Fort-Cumberland
on the tenth of June, at the head of about two thousand
two hundred men, for the Meadows, where Colonel Wash∣ington
was defeated the year bifore. Upon his arrival
there, he was informed that the French at Fort du Quesne,
which had lately been built on the same river, near its con∣fluence
with the Monangahela, expected a re-enforcement
of five hundred regular troops: therefore, that he might
march with the greater dispatch, he left Colonel Dunbar
with eight hundred men to bring up the provisions, stores,
and heavy baggage, as fast as the nature of the service would
permit; and with the other twelve hundred, together with
ten pieces of cannon, and the necessary ammunion and
provisions, he marched on with so much expedition, that
he seldom took any time to reconnoitre the woods or thickets
he was to pass through; as if the nearer he approached the
enemy, the farther he was removed from danger.</P>
<P>§ IX. On the eighth of July, he encamped within ten
miles of Fort du Quesne. Though Colonel Dunbar was
then near forty miles behind him, and his officers, particu∣larly
Sir Peter Halket, earnestly entreated him to proceed
with caution, and to employ the friendly Indians who
were with him, by way of advanced guard, in case of am∣buscades;
yet he resumed his march the next day, without
so much as endeavouring to obtain any intelligence of the
situation or disposition of the enemy, or even sending out
any scouts to visit the woods and thickets on both sides of
<PB N="413" REF="421"/>
him, as well as in his front. With this carelessness he was
advancing, when, about noon, he was saluted with a ge∣neral
fire upon his front, and all along his left flank, from
an enemy so artfully concealed behind the trees and bushes,
that not a man of them could be seen. The vanguard im∣mediately
fell back upon the main body, and in an instant
the panick and confusion became general; so that most
of the troops fled with great precipitation, notwithstand∣ing
all that their officers, some of whom behaved very gal∣lantly,
could do to stop their career. As to Braddock
himself, instead of scouring the thickets and bushes from
whence the fire came, with grape shot from the ten pieces
of cannon he had with him, or ordering flanking parties of
his Indians to advance against the enemy, he obstinately
remained upon the spot where he was, and gave orders for
the few brave officers and men who staid with him, to
form regularly, and advance. Mean while his men fell
thick about him, and almost all his officers were singled out,
one after another, and killed or wounded; for the Indians,
who always take aim when they fire, and aim chiefly at
the officers, distinguished them by their dress. At last, the
general, whose obstinacy seemed to increase with the dan∣ger,
after having had some horses shot under him, received
a musket-shot through the right arm and lungs, of which
he died in a few hours, having been carried off the field by
the bravery of Lieutenant-Colonel Gage, and another of
his officers. When he dropped, the confusion of the few
that remained turned it into a downright and very disorderly
flight across a river which they had just passed, though no
enemy appeared, or attempted to attack them. All the
artillery, ammunition, and baggage of the army were left
to the enemy, and, among the rest, the General's cabinet,
with all his letters and instructions, which the French
court afterwards made great use of in their printed memo∣rials
or manifestoes. The loss of the English in this un∣happy
affair amounted to seven hundred men. Their
officers, in particular, suffered much more than in the or∣dinary
proportion of battles in Europe. Sir Peter Halket
<PB N="414" REF="422"/>
fell by the very first fire, at the head of his regiment; and
the General's secretary, son to Governor Shirley, was
killed soon after. Neither the number of men which the
enemy had in this engagement, nor the loss which they had
sustained, could be so much as guessed at: but the French
afterwards gave out, that their number did not, in the
whole, exceed four hundred men, mostly Indians; and
that their loss was quite inconsiderable, as it probably was,
because they lay concealed in such a manner that the English
knew not whither to point their muskets. The panick
of these last continued so long, that they never stopped till
they met the rear division; and even then they infected
those troops with their terrours; so that the army retreated
without stopping, till they reached Fort Cumberland,
though the enemy did not so much as attempt to pursue,
nor ever appeared in sight, either in the battle, or after
the defeat. On the whole, this was perhaps the most ex∣traordinary
victory that ever was obtained, and the far∣thest
flight that ever was made.</P>
<P>§ X. Had the shattered remains of this army continued
at fort Cumberland, and fortified themselves there, as they
might easily have done during the rest of the summer, they
would have been such a check upon the French and their
scalping Indians, as would have prevented many of those
ravages that were committed in the ensuing winter upon
the western borders of Virginia and Pennsylvania; but,
instead of taking that prudent step, their commander left
only the sick and wounded at that fort, under the protection
of two companies of the provincial militia, posted there by
way of garrison, and began his march on the second of
August, with about sixteen hundred men, from Philadel∣phia;
where those troops could be of no immediate service.
From thence they were ordered away to Albany, in New-York,
by General Shirley, on whom the chief command
of the troops in America had devolved by the death of
Major-General Braddock. Virginia, Maryland, and
Pennsylvania, were by these means left entirely to take
care of themselves, which they might have done effectually,
<PB N="415" REF="423"/>
had they been united in their councils: but the usual dis∣putes,
between their governors and assemblies, defeated
every salutary plan that was proposed. Pennsylvania, the
most powerful of the three, was rendered quite impotent,
either for its own defence, or that of its neighbours, by
these unhappy contests; though, at last, the assembly of
that province, sensible of the danger to which they were
exposed, and seeing the absolute necessity of providing a
standing military force, and of erecting some forts to de∣fend
their western frontier, passed a bill for raising fifty
thousand pounds. But even this sum, small as it was,
even to a degree of ridicule, considering the richness of the
province, and the extent of its frontier, could not be ob∣tained;
the governor positively refusing to give his assent
to the act of the assembly, because they had taxed the
proprietaries estates equally with those of the inhabitants,
which he said, he was ordered by his instructions not to
consent to, nor indeed any new tax upon the proprieta∣ries;
and the assembly, consisting chiefly of members whose
estates lay in the eastern or interior parts of the province,
as positively refusing to alter their bill. One would be
apt to think, that, in case of such urgent necessity, the
governor might have ventured to give his assent to the
bill under a protest, that it should not prejudice the rights
of the proprietaries upon any foture occasion: but as he
did not, the bill was dropped, and the province left defense∣less;
by which means it afterwards suffered severely, to the
destruction of many of the poor inhabitants upon the west∣ern
frontier, and to the impressing the Indians with a con∣temptible
opinion of the English, and the highest esteem of
the French.</P>
<P>§ XI. Our colonies to the north of Pennsylvania were more
active, and more successful in their preparations for war.
New-York, following the example of New-England, pass∣ed
an act to prohibit the sending of provisions to any French
port or settlement on the continent of North-America,
or any of the adjacent islands; and also for raising forty-five
thousand pounds, on estates real and personal, for the better
<PB N="416" REF="424"/>
defence of their colony, which lay more exposed than any
other to a French invasion from Crown-Point. However,
this sum, great as it might seem to them, was far from be∣ing
sufficient; nor, indeed, could they have provided proper∣ly
for their security, without the assistance of our other co∣lonies
to the east of them; but with their help, and the ad∣ditional
succour of the small body of regular troops expected
under Colonel Dunbar, they boldly resolved upon offensive
measures, which, when practicable, are always the safest;
and two expeditions, one against the French fort at Crown-Point,
and the other against their fort at Niagara, between
the lakes Ontario and Erie, were set on foot at the same
time. The former of these expeditions was appointed to
be executed under the command of General Johnson, a
native of Ireland, who had long resided upon the Mohock
river, in the western parts of New-York, where he had
acquired a considerable estate, and was universally be∣loved,
not only by the inhabitants, but also by the neigh∣bouring
Indians, whose language he had learnt, and whose
affections he had gained by his humanity towards them.
The expedition against Niagara was commanded by Ge∣neral
Shirley himself.</P>
<P>§ XII. The rendezvous of the troops for both these ex∣peditions
was appointed to be at Albany, where most of
them arrived before the end of June: but the artillery,
batteaux, provisions, and other necessaries for the attempt
upon Crown-Point, could not be prepared till the eighth
of August, when General Johnson set out with them from
Albany for the Carrying place from Hudson's river to
Lake-George. There the troops had already arrived, un∣der
the command of Major-General Lyman, and consisted
of between five and six thousand men, besides Indians,
raised by the governments of Boston, Connecticut, New-Hampshire,
Rhode-Island, and New-York. Every thing
was then prepared as fast as possible for a march; and to∣wards
the end of the month, General Johnson advanced
about fourteen miles forward with his troops, and encamped
in a very strong situation, covered on each side by a thick
<PB N="417" REF="425"/>
wooded swamp, by Lake George in his rear, and by a
breast-work of trees, cut down for that purpose, in his
front. Here he resolved to wait the arrival of his batteaux,
and afterwards to proceed to Ticonderoga, at the other end
of the lake, from whence it was but about fifteen miles to
the fort at the south end of Lake Corlaer, or Champlain,
called Fort-Frederick by the French, and by us Crown-Point.
Whilst he was thus encamped, some of his Indian
scouts, of which he took care to send out numbers along
both sides, and to the farther end of Lake-George,
brought him intelligence that a considerable number of the
enemy were then on their march from Ticonderoga, by the
way of the south bay, towards the fortified encampment,
since called Fort-Edward, which General Lyman had
built at the Carrying-place, and in which four or five hun∣dred
of the New-Hampshire and New-York men had been
left as a garrison. Upon this information General John∣son
sent two expresses, one after the other, to Colonel
Blanchard, their commander, with orders to call in all his
out-parties, and to keep his whole force within the en∣trenchments.
About twelve o'clock at night, those who
had been sent upon the second express returned with an
account of their having seen the enemy within four miles
of the camp at the Carrying-place, which they scarcely
doubted their having by that time attacked. Important as
the defence of this place was for the safety of the whole
army, and imminent as the danger seemed to be, it does
not appear that the General then called any council of war,
or resolved upon any thing for its relief: but early the next
morning he called a council, wherein it was unadvisedly
resolved to detach a thousand men, with a number of In∣dians,
to intercept, or, as the General's expression was in
his letter, to catch the enemy in their retreat, either as
victors, or as defeated in their design. This expedient
was resolved on, though no one knew the number of the
enemy, nor could obtain any information in that respect
from the Indian scouts, because the Indians have no words
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or signs for expressing any large number, which, when it
<PB N="418" REF="426"/>
exceeds their reckoning, they signify by pointing to the
stars in the firmament, or to the hair of the head; and this
they often do to denote a number less than a thousand, as
well as to signify ten thousand, or any greater number.</P>
<P>§ XIII. Between eight and nine o'clock in the morning
a thousand men, with two hundred Indians, were detached
under the command of Colonel Williams: but they had
not been gone two hours, when those in the camp began to
hear a close firing, at about three or four miles distance, as
they judged: as it approached nearer and nearer, they
rightly supposed that their detachment was overpowered,
and retreating towards the camp; which was soon con∣firmed
by some fugitives, and presently after by whole com∣panies,
who fled back in great confusion. In a very short
time after, the enemy appeared marching in regular order
up to the centre of the camp, where the consternation was
so great, that, if they had attacked the breast-work directly,
they might probably have thrown all into confusion, and
obtained an easy victory: but, fortunately for the English,
they halted for some time about an hundred and fifty yards
distance, and from thence began their attack with platoon
firing, too far off to do much hurt, especially against troops
who were defended by a strong breast-work. On the con∣trary,
this ineffectual fire served only to raise the spirits of
these last, who, having prepared their artillery during the
time that the French halted, began to play it so briskly
upon the enemy, that the Canadians and Indians in their
service fled immediately into the woods on each side of the
camp, and there squatted under bushes, or skulked behind
trees, from whence they continued firing with very little
execution, most of their shot being intercepted by the
brakes and thickets, for they never had the courage to ad∣vance
to the verge of the wood. Baron Dieskau, who
commanded the French, being thus left alone, with hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
regular troops, at the front of the camp, finding he could
not make a close attack upon the centre with his smal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
number of men, moved first to the left, and then to the
right, at both which places he endeavoured to force a pas∣sage,
<PB N="419" REF="427"/>
but was repulsed, being unsupported by the irregu∣lars.
Instead of retreating, as he ought in prudence to have
done, he still continued his platoon and bush-firing till
four o'clock in the afternoon, during which time his regu∣lar
troops suffered greatly by the fire from the camp, and
were at last thrown into confusion; which was no sooner
perceived by General Johnson's men, than they, without
waiting for orders, leaped over their breast-work, attacked
the enemy on all sides, and, after killing or taking a consi∣derable
number of them, entirely dispersed the rest. The
French, whose numbers, at the beginning of this engage∣ment,
amounted to about two thousand men, including
two hundred grenadiers, eight hundred Canadians, and the
rest Indians of different nations, had between seven and
eight hundred men killed, and thirty taken prisoners:
among the latter was Baron Dieskau himself, whom they
found at a little distance from the field of battle, danger∣ously
wounded, and leaning on the stump of a tree for his
support. The English lost about two hundred men, and
those chiefly of the detachment under Colonel Williams;
for they had very few either killed or wounded in the attack
upon their camp, and not any of distinction, except Colonel
Titcomb killed, and the General himself and Major Ni∣chols
wounded. Among the slain of the detachment,
which would probably have been entirely cut off, had not
Lieutenant-Colonel Cole been sent out from the camp
with three hundred men, with which he stopped the enemy's
pursuit, and covered the retreat of his friends, were Colonel
Williams, Major Ashley, six captains, and several subal∣terns,
besides private men; and the Indians reckoned that
they had lost forty men, besides the brave old Hendrick,
the Mohock Sachem, or chief captain.</P>
<P>§ XIV. When Baron Dieskau set out from Ticon∣deroga,
his design was only to surprise and cut off the en∣trenched
camp, now called Fort-Edward, at the Carrying-place,
where there were but four or five hundred men. If
he had executed this scheme, our army would have been
thrown into great difficulties, for it could neither have
<PB N="420" REF="428"/>
proceeded farther, nor have subsisted where it was, and he
might have found an opportunity to attack it with great
advantage in its retreat. But when he was within four or
five miles of that fort, his people were informed that there
were several cannon there, and none at the camp; upon
which they all desired to be led on to this last, which he the
more readily consented to, as he himself had been told by
an English prisoner, who had left this camp but a few days
before, that it was quite defenceless, being without any
lines, and destitute of cannon; which, in effect, was true
at that time, for the cannon did not arrive, nor was the
breast-work erected, till about two days before the engage∣ment.
To this misinformation, therefore, must be im∣puted
this step, which would otherwise be inconsistent with
the general character and abilities of Baron Dieskau. A
less justifiable error seems to have been committed by Gen.
Johnson, in not detaching a party to pursue the enemy
when they were defeated and fled. Perhaps he was pre∣vented
from so doing by the ill fate of the detachment he
had sent out in the morning under Colonel Williams.
However that may be, his neglect, in this respect, had like
to have been fatal the next day to a detachment sent from
Fort-Edward, consisting of an hundred and twenty men
of the New-Hampshire regiment, under Captain M'Gin∣nes,
as a re-enforcement to the army at the camp. This
party fell in with between three and four hundred men of
Dieskau's troops, near the spot where Colonel Williams
had been defeated the day before; but M'Ginnes having
timely notice by his scouts of the approach of an enemy,
made such a disposition, that he not only repulsed the as∣sailants,
but defeated and entirely dispersed them, with the
loss only of two men killed, eleven wounded, and five
missing. He himself unfortunately died of the wounds he
received in this engagement, a few days after he arrived at
the camp with his party.</P>
<P>§ XV. It was now judged too late in the year to proceed
to the attack of Crown-Point, as it would have been ne∣cessary,
in that case, to build a strong fort in the place
<PB N="421" REF="429"/>
where the camp then was, in order to secure a communi∣cation
with Albany, from whence only the troops could
expect to be re-enforced, or supplied with fresh stores of am∣munition
or provisions. They, therefore, set out upon their
return soon after this engagement, having first erected a
little stockaded fort, at the hither end of Lake George, in
which they left a small garrison, as a future prey for the
enemy; a misfortune which might easily have been fore∣seen,
because this whole army, being country militia, was
to be disbanded, and return to their respective homes, as
they actually did soon after their retreat to Albany.
This was all the glory, this all the advantage, that the
English nation acquired by such an expensive expedition.
But so little had the English been accustomed of late to
hear of victory, that they rejoiced at this advantage, as if
it had been an action of the greatest consequence. The
general was highly applauded for his conduct, and libe∣rally
rewarded; for he was created a baronet by his Ma∣jesty,
and presented with five thousand pounds by the par∣liament.</P>
<P>§ XVI. The preparations for General Shirley's ex∣pedition
against Niagara were not only deficient, but
shamefully slow; though it was well known that even the
possibility of his success must, in a great measure, depend
upon his setting out early in the year, as will appear to
any person that considers the situation of our fort at Os∣wego,
this being the only way by which he could proceed
to Niagara. Oswego lies on the south-east side of the
lake Ontario, near three hundred miles almost due-west from
Albany in New-York. The way to it from thence,
though long and tedious, is the more convenient, as the
far greatest part of it admits of water-carriage, by what the
inhabitants call batteaux, which are a kind of light flat-bottomed
boats, widest in the middle, and pointed at each
end, of about fifteen hundred weight burthen, and ma∣naged
by two men, called batteau men, with paddles and
setting poles, the rivers being in many places too narrow
to admit of oars. From Albany to the village of Shenect∣ady,
<PB N="422" REF="430"/>
about sixteen miles, is a good waggon-road. From
thence to the little Falls in the Mohock river, being sixty-five
miles, the passage is by water-carriage up that river,
and consequently against the stream, which in many
places is somewhat rapid, and in others so shallow, that,
when the river is low, the watermen are obliged to get
out, and draw their batteaux over the rifts. At the little
Falls is a postage, or land carriage, for about a mile,
over a ground so marshy, that it will not bear any wheel-carriage:
but a colony of Germans, settled there, attend
with sledges, on which they draw the loaded batteaux to
the next place of embarkation upon the same river. From
thence they proceed by water up that river, for fifty miles,
to the Carrying-place, near the head of it, where there is
another postage, the length of which depends upon the
dryness or wetness of the season, but is generally above
six or eight miles over in the summer months. Here the
batteaux are again carried upon sledges, till they come to
a narrow river called Wood's Creek, down which they
are wafted on a gentle stream, for about forty miles, into
the lake Oneyada, which stretches from east to west about
thirty miles, and is passed with great ease and safety in cal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
weather. At the western end of this lake is the river
Onondaga, which, after a course of between twenty and
thirty miles, unites with the river Cayuga, or Seneca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and their united streams run into the lake Ontario, at th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
place where Oswego-fort is situated. But this river is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
rapid as to be sometimes dangerous, besides its being <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
of rifts and rocks; and about twelve miles on this side <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Oswego there is a fall of eleven <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eet perpendicular, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
there is consequently a postage, which, however, does <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
exceed forty yards. From thence the passage is easy quit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
to Oswego. The lake Ontario, on which this fort stand<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
is near two hundred and eighty leagues in circumference<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
its figure is oval, and its depth runs from twenty to twenty-five
fathoms. On the north side of it are several littl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
gulfs. There is a communication between this lake an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
that of the Hurons by the river Tanasuate, from whenc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="423" REF="431"/>
it is a land carriage of six or eight leagues to the river To∣ronto,
which falls into it. The French have two forts of
consequence on this lake; Frontenac, which commands
the river St. Laurence, where the lake communicates with
it; and Niagara, which commands the communication
between the lake Ontario and the lake Erie. But of these
forts, and this last lake, which is one of the finest in the
world, we shall have occasion to speak hereafter.</P>
<P>§ XVII. Though we had long been in possession of
fort Oswego, and though it lay greatly exposed to the
French, particularly to those of Canada, upon any rupture
between the two nations, we had never taken care to render
it tolerably defensible, or even to build a single vessel fit for
navigating the lake: nor was this strange neglect ever
taken effectual notice of, till the beginning of this year,
when, at a meeting which General Braddock had in April
with the governors and chief gentlemen of several of our
colonies, at Alexandria, in Virginia, it was resolved to
strengthen both the fort and garrison at Oswego, and to
build some large vessels at that place. Accordingly, a
number of shipwrights and workmen were sent thither in
May and June. At the same time Captain Bradstreet
marched thither, with two companies of an hundred men
each, to re-enforce the hundred that were there before
under Captain King, to which number the garrison had
been increased since our contests with France began to
grow serious. For a long time before, not above twenty-five
men were left to defend this post, which from its
great importance, and the situation of affairs at this junc∣ture,
most certainly required a much stronger garrison
than was put into it even at this juncture: but oeconomy
was the chief thing consulted in the beginning of this
war, and to that, in a great measure, was owing its long
duration.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. From the above description of the passage from
Albany to Oswego, it is plain how necessary it was that
the troops intended for this expedition should have set out
early in the spring. But, instead of that, the very first of
<PB N="424" REF="432"/>
them, Colonel Schuyler's New-Jersey regiment, did not
begin their march till after the beginning of July; and
just as Shirley's and Pepperell's regiments were preparing
to follow, the melancholy account of Braddock's disas∣ter
arrived at Albany, where it so damped the spirits of
the people, and spread such a terror, that many of the
troops deserted, and most of the batteau men dispersed,
and ran home, by which means even all the necessary stores
could not be carried along with the troops. Notwithstand∣ing
this disappointment, General Shirley set out from Al∣bany
before the end of July, with as many of the troops
and stores as he could procure a conveyance for, hoping
to be joined in his route by great numbers of the Indians
of the Six Nations, to whom he sent invitations to that
effect as he passed by their settlements: but they, instead
of complying with his desire, absolutely declared against
all hostilities on that side of the country; and insisted
that Oswego, being a place of traffick and peace, ought
not to be disturbed either by the English or the French,
as if they could have persuaded both parties to agree to
such a local truce. Upon this refusal, Mr. Shirley pro∣ceeded
forward, being joined by very few Indians, and ar∣rived
at Oswego on the seventeenth or eighteenth of August;
but the rest of the troops and artillery did not arrive till the
last day of that month: and, even then, their store of pro∣visions
was not sufficient to enable them to proceed against
Niagara, though some tolerable good vessels had by this
time been built and got ready for that purpose. The ge∣neral
now resolved to take but six hundred men with him
for the attack of Niagara, and leave the rest of his army,
consisting of about fourteen hundred more, at Oswego, to
defend that place, in case the French should attack it in
his absence, which there was reason to apprehend they
might, as they had then a considerable force at Fort Fron∣tenac,
from whence they could easily cross over the lake
Ontario to Oswego. However, he was still obliged to
wait at Oswego for provisions, of which at length a small
supply arrived on the twenty-sixth of September, barely
<PB N="425" REF="433"/>
sufficient to support his men during their intended ex∣pedition,
and to allow twelve days short subsistence for
those he left behind. But by this time the rainy boiste∣rous
season had begun, on which account most of his
Indians had already left him, and were returned home;
and the few that remained with him declared that there
was no crossing the lake Ontario in batteaux at that season,
or any time before next summer. In this perplexity
he called a council of war, which, after weighing all cir∣cumstances,
unanimously resolved to defer the attempt
upon Niagara till the next year, and to employ the troops,
whilst they remained at Oswego, in building barracks,
and erecting, or at least beginning to erect, two new forts,
one on the east side of the river<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Onondaga, four hundred
and fifty yards distant from the old fort, which it was to
command, as well as the entrance of the harbour, and to
be called Ontario-fort; and the other four hundred and
fifty yards west of the old fort, to be called Oswego new
fort.</P>
<P>§ XIX. These things being agreed on, General Shirley,
with the greatest part of the troops under his command,
set out on his return to Albany on the twenty-fourth of
October, leaving Colonel Mercer, with a garrison of
about seven hundred men, at Oswego; though repeated
advice had been received, that the French had then at least
a thousand men at their fort of Frontenac, upon the same
lake: and, what was still worse, the new forts were not
yet near completed; but left to be finished by the hard
labour of Colonel Mercer and his little garrison, with the
addition of this melancholy circumstance, that, if besieged
by the enemy in the winter, it would not be possible for
his friends to come to his assistance. Thus ended this
year's unfortunate campaign, during which the French,
with the assistance of their Indian allies, continued their
murthers, scalping, captivating, and laying waste the
western frontiers of Virginia and Pennsylvania, during
the whole winter.</P>
<P><PB N="426" REF="434"/>
§ XX. The ministers of the two jarring powers were
very busily employed this year at most of the courts of
Europe; but their transactions were kept extremely secret.
The French endeavoured to inspire the Spaniards with
a jealousy of the strength of the English by sea, especially
in America; and the Spanish court seemed inclined to
accept of the office of mediator: but Mr. Wall, who was
perfectly well acquainted with the state of affairs between
England and France, seconded the representations of the
British ministry, which demonstrated, that, however wil∣ling
Great-Britain might be to accept of the mediation
of Spain, she could not agree to any suspension of arms
in America, which France insisted on as a preliminary
condition, without hazarding the whole of her interest
there; and that the captures which had been made by
the English were the necessary consequence of the encroach∣ments
and injustice of the French, particularly in that
country. Upon this remonstrance, all further talk of
the mediation of Spain was dropped, and the ministry of
Versailles had recourse to the princes of Germany;
amongst whom the Elector of Cologn was soon brought
over to their party, so as to consent to their forming maga∣zines
in his territories in Westphalia. This was a plain
indication of their design against Hanover, which they
soon after made his Britannick Majesty, who was then at
Hanover, an offer of sparing, if he would agree to certain
conditions of neutrality for that electorate, which he re∣jected
with disdain. Then the Count D'Aubeterre, envoy
extraordinary from France at the court of Vienna, pro∣posed
a secret negociation with the ministers of the Empress-Queen.
The secret articles of the treaty of Petersburgh,
between the two empresses, had stipulated a kind of par∣tition
of the Prussian territories, in case that prince should
infringe the treaty of Dresden; but his Britannick Ma∣jesty,
though often invited, had always refused to agree
to any such stipulation; and the King of Poland, howso∣ever
he might be inclined to favour the scheme, did not
dare to avow it formally, till matters should be more ripe
<PB N="427" REF="435"/>
for carrying it into execution. The court of Vienna,
whose favourite measure this was, began to listen to
D'Aubeterre's insinuations, and by degrees entered into
negotiations with him, which, in the end, were produc∣tive
of that unnatural confederacy between the Empress-Queen
and the King of France, of which further notice
will be taken in the occurrences of the next year, when
the treaty between them, into which they afterwards <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound
means secretly to bring the Empress of Russia, was con∣cluded
at Versailles.</P>
<P>§ XXI. The King of England taking it for granted
that the French would invade Hanover, in consequence
of their rupture with Great-Britain, which seemed to be
near at hand, began to take measures for the defence of that
electorate. To this end, during his stay at Hanover, he
concluded, on the eighteenth of June, a treaty with the
Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, by which his serene highness en∣gaged
to hold in readiness, during four years, for his Ma∣jesty's
service, a body of eight thousand men, to be em∣ployed,
if required, upon the continent, or in Britain or
Ireland; but not on board the fleet, or beyond the seas:
and also, if his Britannick Majesty should judge it neces∣sary
or advantageous for his service, to furnish and join to
this body of eight thousand men, within six months after
they should be demanded, four thousand more, of which
seven hundred were to be horse or dragoons, and each regi∣ment
of infantry to have two field pieces of cannon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The King, on his side, promised to pay to the Landgrave for these suc∣cours, eighty crowns banco, by way of levy-money, for every trooper or dragoon duly armed and mounted, and thirty crowns banco for every foot soldier; the crown to be reckoned at fifty-three <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ols of Holland, or at four shillings and nine pence three farthings English money; and also to pay to his serene highness; for the eight thousand men, an annual subsidy of an hundred and fifty thousand crowns banco, during the four years, to com∣mence from the day of signing the treaty; which subsidy was to be increas∣ed to three hundred thousand crowns yearly from the time of requiring the troops to the time of their entering into British pay; and in case of their being dismissed, the said subsidy of three hundred thousand crowns was then to revive and be continued during the residue of the term; but if twelve thousand men were demanded and furnished, the subsidy was then to be increased in proportion; and in case the King of Great-Britain should at any time think fit to send back these troops, before the expiration of the treaty, notice thereof was to be given to his serene highness three months be∣forehand; one month's pay was to be allowed them for their return, and they were to be furnished gratis with the necessary transport vessels.</NOTE>.
<PB N="428" REF="436"/>
Another treaty was begun with Russia about the same
time; but this did not take effect during his Majesty's
residence at Hanover: that others were not concluded
was the more surprising, as our subsidy treaty with Saxony
had then expired, and that with Bavaria was near expiring,
and as the securing of these two princes in our interest was
at least as necessary towards forming a sufficient con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ede∣racy
upon the continent for the defence of Hanover, as it
was to secure the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel. If the reason
of their not being engaged, and no other seems so proba∣ble,
was, that they refused to renew their treaties with
England upon any terms, all that can be said is, that they
were guilty of flagrant ingratitude, as they had both re∣ceived
a subsidy from this kingdom for many years in
time of peace, when they neither were nor could be of
any service to the interest of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>§ XXII. On the fifteenth of July an express arrived
from Admiral Boscawen, with an account of his having
taken the two French ships of war, the Alcide and the
Lys. This was certainly contrary to the expectation of
the court of France; for had they apprehended any such
attack, they would not have ordered Mr. M'Namara to
return to Brest with the chief part of their squadron;
nor was it, perhaps, less contrary to the expectation of
some of our own ministry: but as matters had been car∣ried
so far, it was then too late to retreat; and, therefore,
orders were soon after given to all our ships of war to
make reprisals upon the French, by taking their ships
whenever they should meet them. Sir Edward Hawke
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailed from Portsmouth on the twenty-first of July, with
eighteen ships of war, to watch the return of the French
fleet from America, which, however, escaped him, and
arrived at Brest on the third day of September. Commo∣dore
<PB N="429" REF="437"/>
Frankland sailed from Spithead for the West-Indies
on the thirteenth of August with four ships of war, fur∣nished
with orders to commit hostilities, as well as to
protect our trade and sugar-islands from any insult
that the French might offer; and the Duke de Mire∣poix,
their ambassador at the court of London, set out
for Paris on the twenty-second of July, without taking
leave.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. A war being thus in some measure begun,
his Majesty thought proper, perhaps for that reason, to
return to his British dominions sooner than usual; for he
left Hanover on the eighth of September, and arrived on
the fifteenth at Kensington, where the treaty of alliance
between him and the Empress of Russia, which he had
begun during his absence, was concluded on the thirtieth
of the same month. By this treaty her Russian Majesty
engaged to hold in readiness in Livonia, upon the frontiers
of Lithuania, a body of troops consisting of forty thousand
infantry, with the necessary artillery, and fifteen thou∣sand
cavalry; and also on the coasts of the same province,
forty or fifty galleys, with the necessary crews; to be
ready to act, upon the first order, in his Majesty's service,
in case, said the fifth article, which was the most remark∣able,
that the dominions of his Britannick Majesty in
Germany should be invaded on account of the interests or
disputes which regard his kingdoms; her Imperial Ma∣jesty
declaring that she would look upon such an invasion
as a case of the alliance of the year one thousand seven hun∣dred
and forty-two; and that the said dominions should
be therein comprised in this respect: but neither these
troops nor gallies were to be put in motion, unless his
Britannick Majesty, or his allies, should be somewhere
attacked; in which case the Russian general should march,
as soon as possible after requisition, to make a diversion
with thirty thousand infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry:
and should embark on board the gallies the other ten thou∣sand
infantry, to make a descent according to the exigency
of the affair. On the other side, his Britannick Ma∣jesty
<PB N="430" REF="438"/>
engaged to pay to her Russian Majesty an annual sub∣sidy
of an hundred thousand pounds sterling a-year, each year
to be paid in advance, and to be reckoned from the day of
the exchange of the ratifications, to the day that these troops
should upon requisition march out of Russia; from which
day the annual subsidy to her Imperial Majesty was to be
five hundred thousand pounds sterling, to be paid always
four months in advance, until the troops should return into
the Russian dominions, and for three months after their
return. His Britannick Majesty, who was to be at
liberty to send once every year into the said province of
Livonia a commissary, to see and examine the number and
condition of the said troops, further engaged, that, in case
her Russian Majesty should be disturbed in this diversion,
or attacked herself, he would furnish immediately the suc∣cour
stipulated in the treaty of one thousand seven hundred
and forty-two; and that, in case a war should break out,
he would send into the Baltick a squadron of his ships, of a
force suitable to the circumstances. This was the chief
substance of the treaty, which, by agreement of both
parties, was to subsist for four years from the exchange of
the ratifications: but in the seventh article these words
were unluckily inserted: “Considering also the proximity
of the countries wherein the diversion in question will
probably be made, and the facility her troops will probably
have of subsisting immediately in an enemy's country,
she takes upon herself alone, during such a diversion, the
subsistence and treatment of the said troops by sea and
land.” And in the eleventh article it was stipulated, that
all the plunder the Russian army should take from the ene∣my
should belong to them. That his Britannick Ma∣jesty,
who now knew enough of the court of Vienna to be
sensible that he could expect no assistance from thence, in
case his German dominions were invaded, should enter into
this convention with the Empress of Russia, in order to
strengthen his defence upon the continent, was extremely
natural; especially as he had lately lived in great friend∣ship
with her, and her transactions with the court of France
<PB N="431" REF="439"/>
had been so secret, by passing through only that of Vienna,
that he had not yet been informed of them; neither had the
project of the treaty of Versailles then come to his know∣ledge,
or to that of the King of Prussia, nor had either of
those princes yet made any formal advances to the other.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. The first intimation that appeared publickly
of the negociations of France with the Empress of Germa∣ny,
was, when the French minister, Count d'Aubeterre,
declared at Vienna, “That the warlike designs with
which the King his master was charged, were sufficiently
confuted by his great moderation, of which all Europe
had manifold proofs: that his Majesty was persuaded
this groundless charge had given as much indignation
to their Imperial Majesties as to himself: that he was
firmly resolved to preserve to Christendom that tran∣quillity
which it enjoyed through his good faith, in re∣ligiously
observing the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle: but
that if his Britannick Majesty's allies should take part
in the war which was kindled in America, by furnish∣ing
succours to the English, his Majesty would be au∣thorised
to consider and treat them as principals in it.”
France likewise made the same declaration to other courts.</P>
<P>§ XXV. The words and stipulation in the above re∣cited
clause, in the seventh article of the treaty of Great-Britain
with Russia, were looked on as a menace levelled at
the King of Prussia, who, having some time after found
means to procure a copy of this treaty, and seeing it in that
light, boldly declared, by his ministers at all the Courts of
Europe, that he would oppose with his utmost force the
entrance of any foreign troops into the empire, under any
pretence whatever. This declaration was particularly
displeasing to the French, who had already marched large
bodies of troops towards the frontiers of the empire, and
erected several great magazines in Westphalia, with the
permission of the Elector of Cologn, for which the English
minister at his court was, in August, ordered to withdraw
from thence without taking leave. However, as soon as
this declaration of the King of Purssia was notified to the
<PB N="432" REF="440"/>
court of Versailles, they sent an ambassador extraordinary,
the Duke de Nivernois, to Berlin, to try to persuade his
Majesty to retract his declaration, and enter into a new
alliance with them. His Prussian Majesty received this
ambassador in such a manner as seemed to denote a dispo∣sition
to agree to every thing he had to propose. This
awakened in England a jealousy that his declaration alone
was not to be relied on, but that it was necessary to bring
him under some solemn engagement; especially as the
French had by this time a numerous army near the Lower
Rhine, with magazines provided for their march all the
way to Hanover; and if the King of Prussia suffered them
to pass through his dominion, that electorate must be swal∣lowed
up before the Russian auxiliaries could possibly be
brought thither, or any army be formed for protecting it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perhaps the Elector of H—was more afraid of the P—n monarch than of the Most Christian King, knowing with what ease and rapidity this enterprising neighbour could in a few days subdue the whole electorate.</NOTE>.
For this reason a negociation was set on foot by Great-Britain
at Berlin; but as it was not concluded before the
beginning of the next year, we shall defer entering into
the particulars of it, till we come to that period.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. Mean while the French made another attempt
upon the Court of Madrid, loudly complaining of the
taking of their two men of war by Boscawen's squadron,
before any declaration of war was made, representing
it as a most unjustifiable proceeding, which threatened a
dissolution of all faith amongst nations. This procuced a
strong memorial from Sir Benjamin Keene, our minister at
that court, importing, “That it was well known that the
French fleet carried troops, ammunition, and every thing
necessary for defending the countries which the French
had unjustly usurped in America, and of which the Eng∣lish
claimed the property: that the rules of self-defence
authorise every nation to render fruitless any attempt
that may tend to its prejudice: that this right had been
made use of only in taking the two French ships of war;
and that the distinction of place might be interpreted in
favour of the English, seeing the two ships were taken on
<PB N="433" REF="441"/>
the coasts of the countries where the contest arose.” In
answer to this observation, the French minister represent∣ed
the vast number of ships that had been taken in the Eu∣ropean
seas; for in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>act the English ports soon began to
be filled with them, in consequence of the general orders
for making reprisals. But the court of Madrid was so far
from being persuaded by any thing he could say, that it
gave his Britannick Majesty the strongest assurances of its
friendship, and of its intention to take no part in the differ∣ences
between him and France, but such as should be con∣ciliatory,
and tending to restore the publick tranquillity.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. On the other hand, his Britannick Majesty
required, as King of Great-Britain, the auxiliaries stipu∣lated
to him by treaty from the Empress-Queen. But
these were refused, under pretence, that as the contest be∣tween
him and France related to America only, it was
not a case of the alliance; though at the same time the
French made no scruple of owning, that they intended to
make a powerful descent on Great-Britain early in the
spring. When, a little while after, France being em∣ployed
in making great preparations for a land war in Eu∣rope,
the King of England required her to defend her own
possessions, the Barrier in the Low Countries, with the
number of men stipulated by treaty, which countries,
acquired by English blood and English treasure, had been
given to her on that express condition, she declared that
she could not spare troops for that purpose, on account of
her dangerous enemy the King of Prussia: and afterwards,
when he was secured by his treaty with England, she urg∣ed
that as a reason for her alliance with France. It must
be owned, however, for the sake of historical truth, that
this was no bad reason, considering the power, the genius,
and the character of that prince, who hovered over her
dominions with an army of one hundred and fifty thousand
veterans. It must likewise be owned that she undertook
to procure the French King's consent to a neutrality for
Hanover, which would have effectually secured that elec∣torate
from the invasion of every other power but Prussia
<PB N="434" REF="442"/>
itself; and it is no strained conjecture to suppose that the
dread of this very power was the true source of those con∣nections
in Germany, which entailed such a ruinous con∣tinental
war upon Great Britain.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. Though the English continued to make
reprisals upon the French, not only in the seas of America,
but also in those of Europe, by taking every ship they could
meet with, and detaining them, their cargoes and crews;
yet the French, whether from a consciousness of their
want of power by sea; or that they might have a more
plausible plea to represent England as the aggressor, were
so far from returning these hostilities, that their fleet,
which escaped Sir Edward Hawke, having, on the thir∣teenth
of August, taken the Blandford ship of war, with
Governor Lyttleton on board, going to Carolina, they
set the Governor at liberty, as soon as the court was in∣formed
of the ship's being brought into Nantes, and short∣ly
after released both the ship and crew. However, at the
same time, their preparations for a land war still went on
with great diligence, and their utmost arts and efforts were
fruitlesly exerted to persuade the Spaniards and Dutch
to join with them against Great-Britain.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. In England the preparations by sea became
greater than ever; several new ships of war were put in
commission, and many others taken into the service of the
government: the exportation of gunpowder was forbid:
the bounties to seamen were continued, and the number
of those that either entered voluntarily, or were pressed,
increased daily, as did also the captures from the French,
among which was the Esperance, of seventy guns, taken
as she was going from Rochefort to Brest to be manned.
The land forces of Great-Britain were likewise ordered to
be augmented; several new regiments were raised, and all
half-pay officers, and the out-pensioners belonging to
Chelsea-hospital, were directed to send in their names,
ages, and time of service, in order that such of them as
were yet able to serve might be employed again if wanted.
The English navy, so early as in the month of Septem∣ber
of this year, consisted of one ship of an hundred and
<PB N="435" REF="443"/>
ten guns, five of an hundred guns each, thirteen of nine∣ty,
eight of eighty, five of seventy-four, twenty-nine of
seventy, four of sixty-six, one of sixty-four, thirty-three
of sixty, three of fifty-four, twenty-eight of fifty, four
of forty-four, thirty-five of forty, and forty-two of twen∣ty,
four sloops of war of eighteen guns each, two of six∣teen,
eleven of fourteen, thirteen of twelve, and one of
ten, besides a great number of bomb-ketches, fire-ships,
and tenders; a force sufficient to oppose the united mari∣time
strength of all the powers in Europe; whilst that of
the French, even at the end of this year, and including
the ships then upon the stocks, amounted to no more than
six ships of eighty guns, twenty-one of seventy-four, one
of seventy-two, four of seventy, thirty-one of sixty-four,
two of sixty, six of fifty, and thirty-two frigates.</P>
<P>§ XXX. Such was the situation of the two kingdoms,
when, on the thirteenth of November, the parliament met,
and his Majesty opened the session with a speech from the
throne, in which he acquainted them—“That the most
proper measures had been taken to protect our possessions
in America, and to regain such parts thereof as had
been encroached upon, or invaded; that to preserve his
people from the calamities of war, as well as to prevent
a general war from being lighted up in Europe, he had
been always ready to accept reasonable and honourable
terms of accommodation, but that none such had been
proposed by France: that he had also confined his views
and operations to hinder France from making new en∣croachments,
or supporting those already made; to exert
his people's right to a satisfaction for hostilities commit∣ted
in a time of profound peace, and to disappoint such
designs, as, from various appearances and preparations,
there was reason to think had been formed against his
kingdoms and dominions: that the King of Spain
earnestly wished the preservation of the public tran∣quillity,
and had given assurances of his intention to
continue in the same pacific sentiments: that he him∣self
had greatly increased his naval armaments, and auq∣mented
<PB N="436" REF="444"/>
his land forces in such a manner as might be
least burthensome; and, finally, that he had conclud∣ed
a treaty with the Empress of Russia, and another
with the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, which should be
laid before them.”</P>
<P>§ XXXI. In answer to this speech, both Houses voted
most loyal addresses, but not without a warm opposition,
in each, to some of the particular expressions, for it having
been proposed in the House of Lords to insert in their ad∣dress
the words following, viz. “That they looked upon
themselves as obliged, by the strongest ties of duty, grati∣tude,
and honour, to stand by and support his Majesty
in all such wise and necessary measures and engage∣ments
as his Majesty might have taken in vindication
of the rights of his crown, or to defeat any attempts
which might be made by France, in resentment for
such measures, and to assist his Majesty in disappointing
or repelling all such enterprises as might be formed, not
only against his kingdoms, but also against any other of
his dominions (though not belonging to the crown of
Great-Britain) in case they should be attacked on ac∣count
of the part which his Majesty had taken for main∣taining
the essential interests of his kingdoms;” the
inserting of these words in their address was opposed by
Earl Temple, and several other lords; because, by the first
part of them, they engaged to approve of the treaties with
Russia and Hesse-Cassel, neither of which they had ever
seen, nor could it be supposed that either of them could be
of any advantage to this nation; and by the second part of
these words it seemed to be resolved to engage this nation
in a continental connexion for the defence of Hanover,
which it was impossible for England to support, and which
would be so far from being of any advantage to it at sea
or in America, that it might at last disable the nation from
defending itself in either of those parts of the world. But
upon putting the question, the inserting of these words was
agreed to by a great majority, and accordingly they stand
as part of the address of the House upon that occasion.</P>
<P><PB N="437" REF="445"/>
§ XXXII. To this remarkable address his Majesty re∣turned
the following as remarkable answer: “My lords,
I give you my hearty thanks for this dutiful and af∣fectionate
address. I see, with the greatest satisfaction,
the zeal you express for my person and government,
and for the true interest of your country, which I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
determined to adhere to. The assurances which you give
me for the defence of my territories abroad are a strong
proof of your affection for me, and regard for my honour.
Nothing shall divert me from pursuing those measures
which will effectually maintain the possessions and rights
of my kingdoms, and procure reasonable and honourable
terms of accommodation.”—The address of the House of
Commons breathed the same spirit of zeal and gratitude,
and was full of the warmest assurances of a ready support of
his Majesty, and of his foreign dominions, if attacked in
resentment of his maintaining the rights of his crown and
kingdom; and his Majesty's answer to it was to the same
effect as that to the House of Lords. The same, or nearly
the same words, relating to the treaties concluded by his
Majesty, and to the defence of his foreign dominions,
were proposed to be inserted in this address, which was op∣posed
by William Pitt, Esq. then paymaster of his Majes∣ty's
forces; the Right Hon. Henry Legge, Esq. then chan∣cellor
and under-treasurer of his Majesty's Exchequer, and
one of the commissioners of the Treasury; and by several
other gentlemen in high posts under the government, as
well as by many others: but, upon putting the question,
it was by a considerable majority agreed to insert the words
objected to; and very soon after, Mr. Pitt, Mr. Legge,
and most, if not all, of the gentlemen who had appeared
in the opposition, were dismissed from their employments.
In the mean time, a draft came over from Russia for part
of the new subsidy stipulated to that crown; but some of
the ministry, who were then at the head of the finances,
refused to pay it, at least before the treaty should be
approved of by parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="438" REF="446"/>
§ XXXIII. Sir Thomas Robinson had not been long
in possession of the office of secretary of state, before it was
generally perceived, that, though an honest, well-meaning
man, and a favourite with the King, his abilities were not
equal to the functions of that post. Much less were they
so at this juncture, when the nation was on the point of
being engaged in a difficult and expensive war, and plunged
into foreign measures and connections, which would re∣quire
the utmost skill of an able politician to render them
palatable to the people. Mr. Pitt and Mr. Fox, though
they scarce ever agreed in any other particular, had ge∣nerally
united in opposing his measures, and their superior
influence in the House of Commons, and universally ac∣knowledged
abilities, though of very different kinds, had
always prevailed, uncommon as it was, to see two persons
who held considerable places under the government, one
of them being paymaster-general, and the other secretary
at war, oppose, upon almost every occasion, a secretary of
state, who was supposed to know and speak the sentiments
of his master. Sir Thomas himself soon grew sensible of
his want of sufficient weight in the senate of the nation;
and therefore, of his own accord, on the tenth of Novem∣ber,
wisely and dutifully resigned the seals of his office to
his Majesty, who delivered them to Mr. Fox, and ap∣pointed
Sir Thomas master of the wardrobe, with a pension
to him during his life, and after his death to his sons.
Lord Barrington succeeded Mr. Fox as secretary at war;
and soon after Sir George Lyttelton was made chancellor
of the Exchequer, and a lord of the Treasury, in the room
of Mr. Legge, who had declared himself against the new
continental system. However, notwithstanding these
changes in the ministry, very warm debates arose in both
Houses, when the treaties of Russia and Hesse-Cassel came
to be considered by them: some of the members were for
referring them to a committee; but this motion was over∣ruled,
in consideration of his Majesty's having engaged in
them to guard against a storm that seemed ready to break
upon his electoral dominions, merely on account of our
<PB N="439" REF="447"/>
quarrel with the French. They were at length approved
of by a majority of three hundred and eighteen against one
hundred and twenty-six, in the House of Commons; and
by eighty-four against eleven, in the House of Lords.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. The House of Commons then proceeded to
provide for the service of the ensuing year, and for the
deficiencies of the provisions for the former. Fifty thou∣sand
seamen, including nine thousand one hundred and
thirty-eight marines, were voted, on the twenty-fourth of
November, for the service of the year one thousand seven
hundred and fifty-six, together with two millions six hun∣dred
thousand pounds for their maintenance, and thirty-four
thousand two hundred and sixty-three land soldiers,
with nine hundred and thirty thousand six hundred and
three pounds, six shillings, and nine pence for their sup∣port.
An hundred thousand pounds were voted as a sub∣sidy
to the Empress of Russia; fifty-four thousand one
hundred and forty pounds, twelve shillings, and six∣pence
to the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel; and ten thousand
pounds to the Elector of Bavaria.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. During these transactions, the publick was
overwhelmed with consternation, by the tidings of a dread∣ful
earthquake, which, on the first of November, shook all
Spain and Portugal, and many other places in Europe,
and laid the city of Lisbon in ruins. When the news of
this great calamity first reached England, it was feared the
consequences of it might affect our publick credit, consi∣dering
the vast interest which the English merchants had
in the Portuguese trade: but, fortunately, it afterwards
proved inconsiderable, in comparison of what had been ap∣prehended:
the quarter in which the English chiefly lived,
and where they had their warehouses, having suffered the
least of any part of the city; and most of the English mer∣chants
then residing there, together with their families,
being at their country houses, to avoid the insults to which
they might have been exposed from the Portuguese popu∣lace,
during the celebration of their <HI>Auto-da-se,</HI> which was
kept that very day. The two first shocks of this dreadful
<PB N="440" REF="448"/>
visitation continued near a quarter of an hour, after which
the water of the river Tagus rose perpendicularly above
twenty feet, and subsided to its natural bed in less than a
minute. Great numbers of houses, of which this city then
contained about thirty-six thousand, extending in length
near six miles, in form of a crescent, on the ascent of a hill,
upon the north shore of the mouth of the river Tagus,
within nine miles from the ocean, were thrown down by
the repeated commotions of the earth, together with several
magnificent churches, monasteries, and publick buildings.
But what entirely completed the ruin of this then most
opulent capital of the Portuguese dominions, was a devour∣ing
conflagration, partly fortuitous or natural, but chiefly
occasioned by a set of impious villains, who, unawed by
the tremendous scene at that very instant passing before
their eyes, with a wickedness scarcely to be credited, set fire
even to the falling edifices in different parts of the city, to
increase the general confusion, that they might have the
better opportunity to rob and plunder their already desolated
fellow citizens. Out of three hundred and fifty thousand
inhabitants, which Lisbon was then supposed to contain,
about ten thousand perished by this calamity; and the sur∣vivors,
deprived of their habitations, and destitute even
of the necessaries of life, were forced to seek for shelter in
the open fields.</P>
<P>§ XXXVI. As soon as his Majesty received an account
of this deplorable event, from his ambassador at the court
of Madrid, he sent a message to both Houses of parliament
on the twenty-eighth of November, acquainting them
therewith, and desiring their concurrence and assistance to∣wards
speedily relieving the unhappy sufferers; and the
parliament thereupon, to the honour of British hu∣manity,
unanimously voted, on the eighth of December,
a gift of an hundred thousand pounds for the distressed
people of Portugal. A circumstance which enhances the
merit of this action is, that though the English themselves
were, at that very time, in great want of grain, a consider∣able
part of the sum was sent in corn, flour, rice, and a
<PB N="441" REF="449"/>
large quantity of beef from Ireland: supplies which came
very seasonably for the poor Portuguese, who were in
actual want of the necessaries of life. Their king was so
affected by this instan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of British generosity, that, to show
his gratitude for the timely relief, he ordered Mr. Castres,
the British resident at his court, to give the preference, in
the distribution of these supplies, to the British subjects,
who had suffered by the earthquake: accordingly, about
a thirtieth part of the provisions, and two thousand pounds
in money, were set apart for that purpose; and his Por∣tuguese
Majesty returned his thanks, in very warm terms,
to the British crown and nation.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. The report of an intended invasion of
these kingdoms by the French increasing daily; on the
twenty-second day of January Lord Barrington, as secre∣tary
at war, laid before the House an estimate for defraying
the charge of ten new regiments of foot, over and above
the thirty-four thousand two hundred and sixty-three land
soldiers before ordered to be raised; and a sum of ninety-one
thousand nine hundred and nineteen pounds, ten shillings,
was voted for these additional forces: upon another estimate
presented a little after by the same lord, and founded upon
the same reasons, for raising, for the further defence of the
kingdom, eleven troops of light dragoons, forty-nine
thousand six hundred and twenty-eight pounds, eleven
shillings, and three pence, were voted for the ensuing
year; together with eighty-one thousand one hundred
and seventy-eight pounds, sixteen shillings, for a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egiment of foot to be raised in North-America;
two hundred and ninety-eight thousand five hundred
and thirty-four pounds, seventeen shillings, and ten pence
half-penny, for the maintenance of our forces already-established
in our American colonies; and seventy-nine
thousand nine hundred and fifteen pounds, six shillings, for
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix regiments of foot from Ireland, to serve in North-Ame∣rica
and the East-Indies. Besides all these supplies,
Mr. Fox, on the twenty-eighth of January, presented to
the House a message from the King, desiring them to take
<PB N="442" REF="450"/>
into consideration the faithful services of the people of
New-England, and of some other parts of North-America;
upon which one hundred and fifteen thousand pounds more
were voted, and five thousand pounds as a reward to Sir
William Johnson in particular. In short, including several
other sums, as well for defraying the expense of the army
and navy, as for a subsidy of twenty thousand pounds to
the King of Prussia, and one hundred and twenty-one thou∣sand
four hundred and forty-seven pounds, two shillings,
and six-pence, for Hanoverian troops, of which two last
articles further notice will be taken hereafter, the whole of
the supplies granted by parliament in this session amounted
to seven millions two hundred and twenty-nine thousand
one hundred and seventeen pounds, four shillings, and six-pence
three farthings. For raising this sum, besides the
malt-tax, and the land-tax of four shillings in the pound,
the whole produce of the sinking-fund, from the fifth of
January one thousand seven hundred and fifty-six, till it
should amount to one million five hundred and fifty-five
thousand nine hundred and fifty-five pounds, eleven shillings,
and eleven pence half-penny, was ordered to be applied
thereunto; together with a million to be raised by loans,
or Exchequer-bills, at three per cent. interest; one million
five hundred thousand pounds to be raised by the sale of
redeemable annuities, at three and a half per cent. and five
hundred thousand pounds to be raised by a lottery, at three
per cent. All which sums, with eighty-three thousand four
hundred and twelve pounds, two shillings, and five pence
half-penny, then remaining in the Exchequer, amounted
to seven millions four hundred and twenty-seven thousand
two hundred and sixty-one pounds, five shillings, and seven
pence.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. The clause inserted in the mutiny bill last
year, subjecting all officers and soldiers raised in America<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
by authority of the respective governors or government<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
there, to the same rules and articles of war, and the same
penalties and punishments, as the British forces were liable
to; the act passed at the same time for regulating the ma∣rine
<PB N="443" REF="451"/>
forces, while on shore: and that for the more speedy
and effectual manning of his Majesty's navy, were not only
confirmed now; but it was further enacted, with respect to
this last, as well as for the more speedy and effectual re∣cruiting
of his Majesty's land-forces. That the commis∣sioners
appointed by the present act should be empowered
to raise and levy, within their respective jurisdictions, such
able bodied men as did not follow any lawful calling or
employment: or had not some other lawful and sufficient
support: and might order, wherever and whenever they
pleased, a general search to be made for such persons, in
order to their being brought before them to be examined;
nay, that the parish or town officers might, without any
such order, search for and secure such persons, in order to
convey them before the said commissioners to be examined:
That if any three commissioners should find any person, so
brought before them, to be within the above description; and
if the recruiting officer attending should judge him to be
a man fit for his Majesty's service, they should cause him to
be delivered to such officer, who might secure him in any
place of safety provided by the justices of peace for that
purpose, or even in any publick prison; and that every
such man was from that time to be deemed a listed soldier,
and not to be taken out of his Majesty's service by any pro∣cess,
other than for some criminal matter. Nothing
could more plainly show either the zeal of the parliament
for a vigorous prosecution of the war, or their confidence
in the justice and moderation of our ministry, than their
agreeing to this act, which was to continue in force till the
end of the next session: and which, in the hands of a
wicked and enterprising administration, might have been
made such an use of, as would have been inconsistent with
that security which is provided by our happy constitution
for the liberty of the subject.</P>
<P>§ XXXIX. The next object of the immediate attention
of parliament in this session was the raising of a new regi∣ment
of foot in North-America; for which purpose the
sum of eighty-one thousand one hundred and seventy-eight
<PB N="444" REF="452"/>
pounds, sixteen shillings, to which the estimate thereof
amounted, was voted. This regiment, which was to con∣sist
of four battalions of a thousand men each, was intended
to be raised chiefly out of the Germans and Swiss, who, for
many years past, had annually transported themselves in
great numbers to the British plantations in America, where
waste lands had been assigned them upon the frontiers of the
provinces; but, very injudiciously, no care had been taken
to intermix them with the English inhabitants of the place.
To this circumstance it is owing, that they have continued
to correspond and converse only with one another; so that
very few of them, even of those who have been born there
have yet learned to speak or understand the English tongue
However, as they were all zealous protestants, and in gene∣ral
strong, hardy men, and accustomed to the climate, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was judged that a regiment of good and faithful soldier
might be raised out of them, particularly proper to oppos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the French: but to this end it was necessary to appoint som<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
officers, especially subalterns, who understood military dis∣cipline,
and could speak the German-language; and as
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sufficient number of such coul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not be found among th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
English officers, it was necessary to bring over and gran<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
commissions to several German and Swiss officers and en∣gineers:
but as this step, by the act of settlement, could
not be taken without the authority of parliament, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
was now passed for enabling his Majesty to grant commissi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ons
to a certain number of foreign protestants, who ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
served abroad as officers or engineers, to act and rank <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
officers or engineers in America only. An act was likewis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
passed in this session, strictly forbidding, under pain <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
death, any of his Majesty's subjects to serve as officers u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣der
the French King, or to inlist as soldiers in his service
without his Majesty's previous license; and also for obli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing
such of his Majesty's subjects as should, in time <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
come, accept of commissions in the Scotch brigade in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Dutch service, to take the oaths of allegiance and abjur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tion,
on pain of forfeiting five hundred pounds.</P>
<P>§ XL. As it had been resolved, in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> beginning of the
preceding summer, to build vessels of force upon the lak<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="445" REF="453"/>
Ontario, an act was now passed for extending the maritime
laws of England, relating to the government of his Majesty's
ships and forces by sea, to such officers, seamen, and others,
as should serve on board his Majesty's ships or vessels em∣ployed
upon the lakes, great waters, or rivers, in North-America;
and also, but not without opposition to this last,
for the better recruiting of his Majesty's forces upon the
continent of America: to which end, by a new clause now
added to a former act, a recruiting officer was empowered
to enlist and detain an indented servant, even though his
master should reclaim him, upon paying to the master such
a sum as two justices of peace within the precinct should
adjudge to be a reasonable equivalent for the original pur∣chase
money, and the remaining time such servant might
have to serve.</P>
<P>§ XLI. The intestine broils of Ireland were happily
composed this year, by the prudent management of the
Marquis of Hartington, lord-lieutenant of that kingdom.
By his steady and disinterested conduct, his candour and
humanity, the Irish were not only brought to a much better
temper, even among themselves, than they were before
their late outrageous riots and dangerous dissentions hap∣pened;
but also prevailed upon to acquiesce in the mea∣sures
of England, without this last being obliged to give up
any one point of her superiority. The leading men in the
parliament of Ireland were the first that conformed: and
though the ferment continued very high for some time after
among the middling and lower ranks of people, it was at
length entirely allayed by the wisdom of the Lord-Lieu∣tenant,
and the excellent laws which he encouraged and
passed for the benefit of that nation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among other objects of the attention of the legislature of that country, ten thousand pounds were granted for making the river Nore navigable from the city of Kilkenny to the town of Innestalge; twenty thousand pounds towards carrying on an inland navigation from the city of Dublin to the river Shannon; four thousand pounds for making the river Newry naviga∣ble, a thousand pounds a year for two years, for the encouragement of English protestant schools; several sums, to be distributed in premiums, for the encouragement of the cambrick, hempen, and slaxen manufactures; and three hundred thousand pounds to his Majesty, towards supporting the several branches of the establishment, and for defraying the expenses of the government for two years.</NOTE> The P—of
<PB N="446" REF="454"/>
Ireland, who had been very busy in fomenting many of
the late disturbances, was, by his Majesty's command,
struck off the list of privy-counsellors; and the greatest part
of those patriots, whom faction had turned out of their
employments there, were re-instated with honour.</P>
<P>§ XLII. The parliament of England, which had ad∣journed
on the twenty-third of December, met again;
the House of Commons on the thirteenth of January, and
the Lords on the nineteenth. On the sixteenth of the
same month,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> the treaty between his Britannick Majesty
and the King of Prussia was signed, importing, That, for
the defence of their common country, Germany, and in
order to preserve her peace and tranquillity, which it was
feared was in danger of being disturbed, on account of
the disputes of America; the two kings, for that end only,
entered into a convention of neutrality, by which they re∣ciprocally
bound themselves not to suffer foreign troops
of any nation whatsoever to enter into Germany, or pass
through it, during the troubles aforesaid, and the conse∣quences
that might result from them; but to oppose the
same with their utmost might, in order to secure Germany
from the calamities of war, maintain her fundamental
laws and constitutions, and preserve her peace uninter∣rupted.
Thus, the late treaty with Russia was virtually
renounced. Their Majesties, moreover, seised this fa∣vourable
opportunity to adjust the differences that had sub∣sisted
between them, in relation to the remainder of the
Silesia loan due to the subjects of his Britannick Majesty,
and the indemnification claimed by the subjects of his
Prussian Majesty for their losses by sea during the late war;
so that the attachment laid on the said debt was agreed to
he taken off, as soon as the ratification of this treaty should
be exchanged.</P>
<P>§ XLIII. On the twenty-first of January the House took
into consideration the laws then in being, relating to the
militia of this kingdom; and, finding them insufficient,
ordered a new bill to be prepared, and brought in, for the
better regulating of the militia forces in the several coun∣ties
<PB N="447" REF="455"/>
of England.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IV. 1756.</NOTE> A bill was accordingly prepared to that
effect, and presented to the House on the twelfth of March
by the Hon. Charles Townshend, Esq. who, to his ho∣nour,
was one of the chief promoters of it. After receiv∣ing
many amendments in the House of Commons, it was
on the tenth of May passed, and sent to the Lords: but
several objections being made to it by some of the peers,
and it seeming to them that some further amendments were
still necessary, which they thought they could not in that
session spare time to consider so maturely as the importance
of the subject required, a negative of fifty-nine against
twenty-three was put upon the motion for passing the bill;
though every one must have been sensible, not only of the
propriety, but even of the absolute necessity of such a law,
which was ardently desired by the whole nation.</P>
<P>§ XLIV. On the twenty-seventh of May his Majesty
went to the House of Peers, and, after having given the
royal assent to the bills then depending, thanked his parlia∣ament,
in a speech from the throne, for their vigorous and
effectual support. He acquainted them, that the injuries
and hostilities which had been for some time committed by
the French against his dominions and subjects were then
followed by the actual invasion of the island of Minorca,
though guaranteed to him by all the great powers of Eu∣rope,
and particularly by the French King: That he had,
therefore, found himself obliged, in vindication of the ho∣nour
of his crown, and of the rights of his people, to de∣clare
war in form against France; and that he relied on
the Divine Protection, and the vigorous assistance of his
faithful subjects, in so just a cause. The parliament was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen adjourned to the eighteenth of June; and from thence
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fterwards to the eighteenth of July, and then it was pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogued.</P>

<P>§ I. IN the month of January Mr. Fox, CHAP. V. lately appointed
secretary of state, received a letter from M. Rou∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llé,
minister and secretary of state for foreign affairs to the
King of France, expostulating, in the name of his sove∣reign,
upon the orders and instructions for committing
hostilities, which his Britannick Majesty had given to
General Braddock and Admiral Boscawen, in diametrical
opposition to the most solemn assurances so often repeated
by word of mouth, as well as in writing. He complained
of the insult which had been offered to his master's flag, in
attacking and taking two of his ships in the open sea, with∣out
any previous declaration of war; as also by committing
depredations on the commerce of his most Christian Majesty's
subjects, in contempt of the law of nations, the faith of
treaties, and the usages established among civilised nations.
He said, the sentiments and character of his Britannick
Majesty gave the king his master room to expect, that, at
his return to London, he would disavow the conduct of
his Admiralty; but seeing that, instead of punishing, he
rather encouraged those who had been guilty of such de∣predations,
his most Christian Majesty would be deemed
deficient in what he owed to his own glory, the dignity of
his crown, and the defence of his people, if he deferred any
longer demanding a signal reparation for the outrage done
to the French flag, and the damage sustained by his subjects.
He, therefore, demanded immediate and full restitution of
all the French ships, which, contrary to law and decorum,
had been taken by the English navy, together with all the
officers, soldiers, mariners, guns, stores, and merchandise.
He declared, that should this restitution be made, he should
be willing to engage in a negociation for what further satis∣faction
he might claim, and continue desirous to see the
<PB N="450" REF="458"/>
differences relating to America determined by a solid and
equitable accommodation: but if, contrary to all hopes,
these demands should be rejected, he would consider such
a denial of justice as the most authentick declaration of
war, and as a formed design in the court of London to
disturb the peace of Europe. To this peremptory remon∣strance
the British secretary was directed to answer, That
though the King of England would readily consent to an
equitable and solid accommodation, he would not comply
with the demand of immediate and full restitution as a pre∣liminary
condition; for his Majesty had taken no steps
but such as were rendered just and indispensible by the
hostilities which the French began in time of profound
peace, and a proper regard for his own honour, the rights
and possessions of his crown, and the security of his king∣doms.</P>
<P>§ II. Without all doubt the late transactions had afforded
specious arguments for both nations to impeach the conduct of
each other. The French court, conscious of their encroach∣ments
in Nova-Scotia, affected to draw a shade over these, as
particulars belonging to a disputed territory, and to divert
the attention to the banks of the Ohio, where Jamonville
and his detachment had been attacked and massacred by
the English, without the least provocation. They like∣wise
inveighed against the capture of their ships, before
any declaration of war, as slagrant acts of piracy; and
some neutral powers of Europe seemed to consider them in
the same point of view. It was certainly high time to
cheek the insolence of the French by force of arms, and
surely this might have been as effectually and expeditiously
exerted under the usual sanction of a formal declaration;
the omission of which exposed the administration to the
censure of our neighbours, and fixed the imputation of
fraud and free-booting on the beginning of the war. The
ministry was said to have delayed the ceremony of de∣nouncing
war from political considerations, supposing
that, should the French be provoked into the first declara∣tion
of this kind, the powers of Europe would consider
<PB N="451" REF="459"/>
his Most Christian Majesty as the aggressor, and Great-Britain
would reap all the fruits of the defensive alliances
in which she had engaged. But nothing could be more
weak and frivolous than such a conjecture. The aggressor
is he who first violates the peace; and every ally will in∣terpret
the aggression according to his own interest and
convenience. The administration maintained the ap∣pearance
of candour in the midst of their hostilities. The
merchant-ships, of which a great number had been taken
from the French, were not sold and divided among the
captors, according to the practice of war; but carefully
sequestered, with all their cargoes and effects, in order to
be restored to the right owners, in case the disputes between
the two nations should not be productive of an open rup∣ture.
In this particular, however, it was pity that a little
common sense had not been blended with their honourable
intention. Great part of the cargo consisted of fish, and
other perishable commodities, which were left to rot and
putrify, and afterwards thrown overboard, to prevent con∣tagion;
so that the owners and captors were equally dis∣appointed,
and the value of them lost to both nations.</P>
<P>§ III. The court of Versailles, while they presented re∣monstrances
which they knew would prove ineffectual,
and exclaimed against the conduct of Great-Britain with
all the arts of calumny and exaggeration at every court in
Christendom, continued nevertheless to make such prepa∣rations
as denoted a design to prosecute the war with un∣common
vigour. They began to repair and fortify Dun∣kirk:
orders were published, that all British subjects
should quit the dominions of France; many English vessels
were seised in different ports of that kingdom, and their
crews sent to prison. At the same time an edict was
issued, inviting the French subjects to equip privateers,
offering a premium of forty livres for every gun, and as
much for every man they should take from the enemy;
and promising that, in case a peace should be speedily con∣cluded,
the king would purchase the privateers at prime
cost. They employed great numbers of artificers and
<PB N="452" REF="460"/>
seamen in equipping a formidable squadron of ships at Brest;
and assembling a strong body of land-forces, as well as a
considerable number of transports, threatened the island of
Great-Britain with a dangerous invasion.</P>
<P>§ IV. The English people were seised with consternation:
the ministry were alarmed and perplexed. Colonel Yorke,
the British resident at the Hague, was ordered by his Ma∣jesty
to make a requisition of the six thousand men whom
the States-General are obliged by treaty to furnish, when
Great-Britain shall be threatened with an invasion; and
in February he presented a memorial for this purpose.
Monsieur d'Affry, the French King's minister at the Hague,
having received intimation of this demand, produced a
counter memorial from his master, charging the English
as the aggressors, and giving the States-General plainly
to understand, that, should they grant the succours de∣manded
by Great-Britain, he would consider their com∣pliance
as an act of hostility against himself. The Dutch,
though divided among themselves by faction, were unani∣mously
averse to any measure that might involve them in
the approaching war. Their commerce was in a great
measure decayed, and their finances were too much ex∣hausted
to admit of an immediate augmentation of their
forces, which for many other reasons they strove to avoid.
They foresaw a great increase of trade in their adhering to
a punctual neutrality: they were afraid of the French by
land, and jealous of the English by sea; and, perhaps, en∣joyed
the prospect of seeing these two proud and powerful
nations humble and impoverish each other. Certain it is,
the States General protracted their answer to Mr. Yorke's
memorial by such offected delays, that the court of Lon∣don
perceived their intention, and, in order to avoid the
mortification of a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lat denial, the King ordered his resi∣dent
to acquaint the Princess regent, that he would not
insist upon his demand. The States, thus freed from
their perplexity, at length delivered an answer to Mr.
Yorke, in which they expatiated on the difficulties they
were laid under, and thanked his Britannick Majesty for
<PB N="453" REF="461"/>
having freed them by his declaration from that embarrass∣ment
into which they were thrown by his first demand and
the counter memorial of the French minister. The real
sentiments of those people, however, more plainly appeared
in the previous resolution delivered to the States of Holland
by the towns of Amsterdam, Dort, Haerlem, Gouda,
Rotterdam, and Enckhuysen, declaring flatly that England
was uncontrovertibly the aggressor in Europe, by seising
a considerable number of French vessels; that the threatened
invasion of Great-Britain did not affect the republick's
guarantee of the protestant succession, inasmuch as it was
only intended to obtain reparation for the injury sustained
by the subjects of his most Christian Majesty; finally,
that the succours demanded could be of no advantage to
the King of England, as it appeared by the declaration
of his most Christian Majsty, that their granting these
succours would immediately lay them under a necessity of
demanding, in their turn, assistance from Great-Britain.
From this way of arguing, the English may perceive what
they have to expect in cases of emergency from the friend∣ship
of their nearest allies, who must always be furnished
with the same excuse, whenever they find it convenient or
necessary to their own interest. Such a consideration,
joined to other concurring motives, ought to induce the
British legislature to withdraw its dependence from all
foreign connexions, and provide such a constitutional force
within itself, as will be fully sufficient to bafle all the
efforts of an external enemy. The apprehensions and
distraction of the people at this juncture plainly evinced
the expediency of such a national force: but different par∣ties
were divided in their opinions about the nature of
such a provision. Some of the warmest friends of their
country proposed a well regulated militia, as an institution
that would effectually answer the purpose of defending a
wide extending sea-coast from invasion; while, on the
other hand, this proposal was ridiculed and refuted as
impracticable or useless by all the retainers to the court, and
all the officers of the standing army. In the mean time,
<PB N="454" REF="462"/>
as the experiment could not be immediately tried, and
the present juncture demanded some instant determinati∣on,
recourse was had to a foreign remedy.</P>
<P>§ V. Towards the latter end of March, the King sent a
written message to parliament, intimating that he had re∣ceived
repeated advices from different persons and places,
that a design had been formed by the French court to invade
Great-Britain or Ireland; and the great preparations of
forces, ships, artillery, and warlike stores, then notori∣ously
making in the p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rts of France opposite to the British
coasts, together with the language of the French ministers
in some foreign courts, left little room to doubt the reality
of such a design: that his Majesty had augmented his forces
both by sea and land, and taken proper measures and pre∣cautions
for putting his kingdom in a posture of defence:
that, in order further to strengthen himself, he had made
a requisition of a body of Hessian troops, pursuant to the
late treaty, to be forthwith brought over, and for that pur∣pose
ordered transports to be prepared: that he doubted
not of being enabled and supported by his parliament in
taking such measures as might be conducive to an end
so essential to the honour of his crown, the preservation of
the protestant religion, and the laws and liberties of these
kingdoms. This message was no sooner received, than
both Houses voted, composed, and presented very warm and
affectionate addresses, in which his Majesty was thanked for
the requisition he had made of the Hessian troops; a mea∣sure
which at any other time would have been stigmatised
with all the satire and rhetorick of the opposition.</P>
<P>§ VI. Even this precaution was not thought sufficient to
secure the island, and quiet the terrors of the people. In a
few days Mr. Fox, the new minister, encouraged by the
unanimity which had appeared so conspicuous in the mo∣tions
for the late addresses, ventured to move again, in the
House of Commons, that another address should be pre∣sented
to the King, beseeching his Majesty, that for the
more effectual defence of this island, and for the better se∣curity
of the religion and liberties of his subjects, against
<PB N="455" REF="463"/>
the threatened attack by a foreign enemy, he would be
graciously pleased to order twelve battalions of his electoral
troops, together with the usual detachment of artillery, to
be forthwith brought into this kingdom. There was a
considerable party in the house, to whom such a motion
was odious and detestable: but, considering the critical
situation of affairs, they were afraid that a direct opposition
might expose them to a more odious suspicion: they, there∣fore,
moved for the order of the day, and insisted on the
question's being put upon that motion; but it was carried
in the negative by a considerable majority, which also
agreed to the other proposal. The resolution of the House
was communicated to the Lords, who unanimously con∣curred:
and their joint address being presented, his Ma∣jesty
assured them he would immediately comply with their
request. Accordingly, such expedition was used, that in
the course of the next month both Hanoverians and Hes∣sians
arrived in England, and encamped in different parts
of the kingdom.—As the fears of an invasion subsided in the
minds of the people, their antipathy to these foreign auxili∣aries
emerged. They were beheld with the eyes of jealousy,
suspicion, and disdain. They were treated with contempt,
reserve, and rigour. The ministry was execrated for having
reduced the nation to such a low circumstance of disgrace, as
that they should owe their security to German mercenaries.
There were not wanting some incendiaries, who circulated
hints and insinuations, that the kingdom had been pur∣posely
left unprovided; and that the natives of South-Bri∣tain
had been formerly subdued and expelled by a body of
Saxon auxiliaries, whom they had hired for their preser∣vation.
In a word, the doubts and suspicions of a people
naturally blunt and jealous were inflamed to such a degree
of animosity, that nothing would have restrained them
from violent acts of outrage, but the most orderly, modest,
and inoffensive behaviour by which both the Hanoverians
and Hessians were distinguished.</P>
<P>§ VII. Under the cloak of an invading armament,
which ingrossed the attention of the British nation, the
<PB N="456" REF="464"/>
French were actually employed in preparations for an ex∣pedition,
which succeeded according to their wish. In
the beginning of the year advice was received that a French
squadron would soon be in a condition to sail from Tou∣lon:
this was afterwards confirmed by repeated intelligence,
not only from foreign gazettes, but also from English mi∣nisters
and consuls residing in Spain and Italy. They
affirmed that the Toulon squadron consisted of twelve or
fifteen ships of the line, with a great number of tran∣sports;
that they were supplied with provisions for two
months only, consequently could not be intended for Ame∣rica;
and that strong bodies of troops were on their march
from different parts of the French dominions to Dauphine
and Provence, in order to be embarked. Notwithstanding
these particulars, of information, which plainly pointed out
Minorca as the object of their expedition; notwithstanding
the extensive and important commerce carried on by the
subjects of Great-Britain in the Mediterranean; no care
was taken to send thither a squadron of ships capable to
protect the trade, and frustrate the designs of the enemy.
That great province was left to a few inconsiderable ships
and frigates, which could serve no other purpose than that
of carrying intelligence from port to port, and enriching
their commanders, by making prize of merchant vessels.
Nay, the ministry seemed to pay little or no regard to the
remonstrance of General Blakeney, deputy governor of
Minorca, who, in repeated advices, represented the weak∣ness
of the garrison which he commanded in St. Philip's
castle, the chief fortress on the island. Far from
strengthening the garrison with a proper re-enforcement,
they did not even send thither the officers belonging to it,
who were in England upon leave of absence, nor give di∣rections
for any vessel to transport them, until the French
armament was ready to make a descent upon that island<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is with pleasure we seise this opportunity of recording an instance of gallantry and patriotism in a British officer, which would have done honour to the character of a Roman tribune. Captain Cunningham, an accomplished young gentleman, who acted as engineer in second at Minorca, being pre∣ferred to a majority at home, and recalled to his regiment by an express order, had repaired with his family to Nice in Italy, where he waited for the opportunity of a ship bound for England, when he received certain in∣telligence that the French armament was destined for the place he had quit∣ted. His lady, whom he tenderly loved, was just delivered, and two of his children were dangerously ill of the small-pox. He recollected that the chief engineer at Minorca was infirm, and indeed disabled by the gout, and that many things were wanting for the defence of the fortress. His zeal for the honour and service of his country immediately triumphed over the calls of tenderness and of nature. He expended a considerable sum of money in purchasing timber for the platforms, and other necessaries for the garrison; hired a ship for transporting them thither; and tearing himself from his wise and children, thus left among strangers in a foreign country, embarked again for Minorca, where he knew he should be in a peculiar manner exposed to all the dangers of a furious siege. In the course of this desperate service he acquitted himself with that vigilance, skill, and active courage which he had on divers <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormer occasions displayed, until the assault was given to the Queen's-bastion, when mixing with the enemy sword in hand, he was dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abled in his right arm by the shot of a musket and the thrust of a bayon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. His behaviour was so acceptable to his sovereign, that when he returned to England he was preferred to the rank of colonel in the guards. He after∣wards acted as chief engineer in the attempts and descents which were made on the French coast. Though grievously maimed, he accepted the same of∣fice in the expedition to Guadaloupe, where he died universally regretted.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="457" REF="465"/>
§ VIII. At length, the destination of the enemy's fleet
being universally known, the ministry seemed to rouse
from their lethargy, and, like persons suddenly waking,
acted with hurry and precipitation. Instead of detaching
a squadron that in all respects should be superior to the
French fleet in the Mediterranean, and bestowing the com∣mand
of it upon an officer of approved courage and acti∣vity,
they allotted no more than ten ships of the line for
this service, vesting the command of them in Admiral
Byng, who had never met with any occasion to signalize
his courage, and whose character was not very popular in
the navy: but Mr. West, the second in command, was
a gentleman universally respected for his probity, ability,
and resolution. The ten ships destined for this expedition
were but in very indifferent order, poorly manned, and
unprovided with either hospital or fire-ship. They sailed
from Spithead on the seventh day of April, having on
board, as part of their complement, a regiment of soldiers
to be landed at Gibraltar, with Major-General Stuart,
<PB N="458" REF="466"/>
Lord Effingham, and Colonel Cornwallis, whose regi∣ments
were in garrison at Minorca, about forty inferior
officers, and near one hundred recruits, as a re-enforcement
to St. Philip's fortress.</P>
<P>§ IX. After all the intelligence which had been received,
one would imagine the government of England was still ig∣norant
of the enemy's force and destination; for the in∣structions
delivered to Admiral Byng imported, that, on
his arrival at Gibraltar, he should enquire whether any
French squadron had passed through the straits; and that,
being certified in the affirmative, as it was probably de∣signed
for North-America, he should immediately detach
Rear-Admiral West to Louisbourg, on the island of Cape-Breton,
with such a number of ships as, when joined with
those at Hallifax, would constitute a force superior to the
armament of the enemy. On the second day of May, Ad∣miral
Byng arrived at Gibraltar, where he found Captain
Edgecumbe, with the Princess Louisa ship of war, and a
sloop, who informed him, that the French armament, com∣manded
by M. de la Galissonniere, consisting of thirteen
ships of the line, with a great number of transports, having
on board a body of fifteen thousand land-forces, had sailed
from Toulon on the tenth day of April, and made a descent
upon the island of Minorca, from whence he (Captain
Edgecumbe) had been obliged to retire at their approach.
General Fowke, who commanded at Gibraltar, had re∣ceived
two successive orders from the Secretary at War
with respect to his sparing a battalion of troops to be trans∣ported
by Mr. Byng, as a re-enforcement to Minorca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
but as the two orders appeared inconsistent or equivocal▪
a council of war was consulted, and the majority were o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
opinion that no troops should be sent from thence to Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>norca,
except a detachment to supply the deficiency in the
little squadron o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Captain Edgecumbe, who had left a good
number of his seamen and marines, under the command of
Captain Scroop, to assist in the defence of Fort St. Philip's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
These articles of intelligence the Admiral dispatched by
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an express to the Lords of the Admiralty, and in his letter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="459" REF="467"/>
made use of some impolitick expressions, which, in all
probability, it would have been well for him had he omit∣ted.
He said, if he had been so happy as to have arrived
at Mahon before the French had landed, he flattered him∣self
he should have been able to prevent their getting a
footing on that island. He complained, that there were
no magazines in Gibraltar for supplying the squadron with
necessaries; that the care<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning-wharfs, pits, and store-houses
were entirely decayed, so that he should find the
greatest difficulty in cleaning the ships that were soul;
and this was the case with some of those he carried out
from England, as well as with those which had been for
some time cruising in the Mediterranean. He signified
his opinion, that, even if it should be found practicable, it
would be very impolitick to throw any men into St. Phi∣lip's-castle,
which could not be saved without a land
force sufficient to raise the siege; therefore, a small re-en∣forcement
would only add so many men to the number
which must fall into the hands of the enemy. He observed,
that such engineers and artillery-men in Gibraltar as had
been at Minorca, were of opinion, that it would be impossi∣ble
to throw any number of men into St. Philip's, if the
French had erected batteries on the two shores near the
entrance of the harbour, so as to bar all passage up to the
sally-port of the fortress; and with this opinion he signified
the concurrence of his own sentiments. The first part of
this letter was a downright impeachment of the ministry,
for having delayed the expedition, for having sent out ships
unfit for service, and for having neglected the magazines
and wharfs at Gibraltar. In the latter part he seemed to
prepare them for the subsequent account of his misconduct
and miscarriage. It cannot be supposed that they under∣went
this accusation without apprehension and resentment;
and as they foresaw the loss of Minorca, which would
not fail to excite a national clamour, perhaps they now
began to take measures for gratifying their resentment, and
transferring the blame from themselves to the person who
had presumed to hint a disapprobation of their conduct; for
<PB N="460" REF="468"/>
this purpose they could not have found a fairer opporunity
than Mr. Byng's subsequent behaviour afforded.</P>
<P>§ X. The Admiral, being strengthened by Mr. Edge∣cumbe,
and re-enforced by a detachment from the garrison,
set sail from Gibraltar on the eighth day of May, and was
joined off Majorca by his Majesty's ship the Phoenix,
under the command of Captain Hervey, who confirmed the
intelligence he had already received, touching the strength
and destination of the French squadron. When he ap∣proached
Minorca, he descried the British colours still
flying at the castle of St. Philip's, and several bomb batte∣ries
playing upon it from different quarters, where the
French banners were displayed. Thus informed, he de∣tached
three ships a-head, with Captain Hervey, to recon∣noitre
the harbour's mouth, and land, if possible, a letter
for General Blakeney, giving him to understand the fleet
was come to his assistance. Before this attempt could be
made, the French fleet appearing to the south-east, and the
wind blowing strong off shore, he recalled his ships, and
formed the line of battle. About six o'clock in the even∣ing,
the enemy, to the number of seventeen ships, thirteen
of which appeared to be very large, advanced in order; but
about seven tacked, with a view to gain the weather-gage.
Mr. Byng, in order to preserve that advantage, as well as
to make sure of the land-wind in the morning, followed
their example, being then about five leagues from Cape-Mola.
At day light the enemy could not be described; but
two tartanes appearing close to the rear of the English squa∣dron,
they were immediately chased by signal. One
escaped, and the other being taken, was found to have on
board two French captains, two lieutenants, and about one
hundred private soldiers, part of six hundred who had been
sent out in tartanes the preceding day, to re-enforce the
enemy's squadron. This soon re-appearing, the line of
battle was formed on each side, and about two o'clock
Admiral Byng threw out a signal to bear away two points
from the wind and engage. At this time his distance from
the enemy was so great, that Rear-Admiral West, per∣ceiving
<PB N="461" REF="469"/>
it impossible to comply with both orders, bore away
with his division seven points from the wind, and closing
down upon the enemy, attacked them with such impetu∣osity,
that the ships which opposed him were in a little time
driven out of the line. Had he been properly sustained by
the van, in all probability the British fleet would have ob∣tained
a complete victory; but the other division did not
bear down, and the enemy's centre keeping their station,
Rear-Admiral West could not pursue his advantage with∣out
running the risque of seeing his communication with
the rest of the line entirely cut off. In the beginning of
the action, the Intrepid, in Mr. Byng's division, was so
disabled in her rigging, that she could not be managed, and
drove on the ship that was next in position: a circumstance
which obliged several others to throw all a-back, in order to
avoid confusion, and for some time retarded the action.
Certain it is, that Mr. Byng, though accommodated with
a noble ship of ninety guns, made little or no use of his
artillery, but kept aloof, either from an overstrained ob∣servance
of discipline, or timidity. When his captain ex∣horted
him to bear down upon the enemy, he very coolly
replied, that he would avoid the error of Admiral Matthews,
who, in his engagement with the French and Spanish squa∣drons
off Toulon, during the preceding war, had broke
the line by his own precipitation, and exposed himself
singly to a fire that he could not sustain. Mr. Byng, on
the contrary, was determined against acting, except with
the line entire; and, on pretence of rectifying the disorder
which had happened among some of the ships, hesitated so
long, and kept at such a wary distance, that he never was
properly engaged, though he received some few shots in his
bull. M. de la Galissonniere seemed equally averse to the
continuance of the battle: part of his squadron had been
fairly obliged to quit the line; and though he was rather
superior to the English in number of men and weight of
metal, he did not choose to abide the consequence of a closer
fight with an enemy so expert in naval operations: he,
therefore, took advantage of Mr. Byng's hesitation, and
<PB N="462" REF="470"/>
edged away with an easy sail to join his van, which had
been discomfited. The English Admiral gave chase, but
the French ships being clean, he could not come up and
close them again, so they retired at their leisure. Then he
put his squadron on the other tack, in order to keep the
wind of the enemy; and next morning they were altoge∣ther
our of sight.</P>
<P>§ XI. While he lay to with the rest of his fleet, at the
distance of ten leagues from Mahon, he detached cruisers to
look for some missing ships, which joined him accordingly,
and made an enquiry into the condition of the squadron.
The number of killed amounted to forty-two, including
Captain Andrews, of the Defiance, and about one hundred
and sixty-eight were wounded. Three of the capital ships
were so damaged in their masts, that they could not keep
the sea, with any regard to their safety: a great number of
the seamen were ill, and there was no vessel which could
be converted into an hospital for the sick and wounded.
In this situation Mr. Byng called a council of war, at
which the land officers were present. He represented to
them, that he was much inferior to the enemy in weight
of metal and number of men; that they had the advan∣tage
of sending their wounded to Minorca, from whence
at the same time they were refreshed and re-enforced occa∣sionally;
that, in his opinion, it was impracticable to relieve
St. Philip's fort, and, therefore, they ought to make the
best of their way back to Gibraltar, which might require
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmediate protection. They unanimously concurred with
his sentiments, and thither he directed his course accordingly.
How he came to be so well acquainted with the impractica∣bility
of relieving General Blakeney it is not easy to de∣termine,
as no experiment was made for that purpose.
Indeed, the neglect of such a trial seems to have been the
least excuseable part of his conduct; for it afterwards ap∣peared,
that the officers and soldiers belonging to the gar∣rison
might have been landed at the sally-port, without
running any great risque; and a gentleman, then in the
<PB N="463" REF="471"/>
fort, actually passed and repassed in a boat, unhurt by
any of the enemy's batteries.</P>
<P>§ XII. Mr. Byng's letter to the Admiralty, containing
a detail of this action, is said to have arrived some days be∣fore
it was made publick; and when it appeared, was cur∣tailed
of divers expressions, and whole paragraphs, which
either tended to his own justification, or implied a censure
on the conduct of his superiors. Whatever use might have
been made of this letter while it remained a secret to the
publick we shall not pretend to explain: but sure it is,
that, on the sixteenth day of June, Sir Edward Hawke and
Admiral Saunders sailed from Spithead to Gibraltar, to
supersede the Admirals Byng and West, in their commands
of the Mediterranean squadron; and Mr. Byng's letter was
not published till the twenty-sixth day of the same month,
when it produced all the effect which that gentleman's bit∣terest
enemies could have desired. The populace took fire
like a train of the most hasty combustibles, and broke out
into such a clamour of rage and indignation against the de∣voted
Admiral, as could not have been exceeded if he had
lost the whole navy of England, and left the coasts of the
kingdom naked to invasion. This animosity was carefully
fomented and maintained by artful emissaries, who mingled
with all publick assemblies, from the drawing room at St.
James's to the mob at Charing-cross. They expatiated
upon the insolence, the folly, the cowardice, and miscon∣duct
of the unhappy Admiral. They even presumed to
make their sovereign in some measure an instrument of their
calumny, by suggesting that his Majesty had prognosticated
Byng's misbehaviour from the contents of his first letter,
dated at Gibraltar. They ridiculed and refuted the reasons
he had given for returning to that fortress, after his scan∣dalous
rencounter with the French squadron; and, in order
to exasperate them to the most implacable resentment, they
exaggerated the terrible consequences of losing Minorca,
which must now be subdued through his treachery or want
of resolution. In a word, he was devoted as the scape∣goat
of the ministry, to whose supine negligence, ignorance,
<PB N="464" REF="472"/>
and misconduct the loss of that important fortress was un∣doubtedly
owing. Byng's miscarriage was thrown out like
a barrel to the whale, in order to engage the attention of
the people, that it might not be attracted by the real cause
of the national misfortune. In order to keep up the flame
which had been kindled against the Admiral, recourse was
had to the lowest artifices. Agents were employed to vilify
his person in all publick places of vulgar resort; and mobs
were hired at different parts of the capital to hang and
burn him in effigy.</P>
<P>§ XIII. The two officers who succeeded to the com∣mand
in the Mediterranean were accompanied by Lord
Tyrawley, whom his majesty had appointed to supersede
General Fowke in the government of Gibraltar, that gen∣tleman
having incurred the displeasure of the ministry, for
not having understood an order which was unintelligible.
By the same conveyance, a letter from the secretary to the
Admiralty was transmitted to Mr. Byng, giving him
notice that he was recalled. To this intimation he replied
in such a manner as denoted a consciousness of having done
his duty, and a laudable de fire to vindicate his own con∣duct.
His answer contained a further account of the en∣gagement
in which he was supposed to have misbehaved,
intermixed with some puerile calculations of the enemy's
superiority in weight of metal, which served no other pur∣pose
than that of exposing his character still more to ridicule
and abuse; and he was again so impolitick as to hazard
certain expressions, which added fresh fuel to the resentment
of his enemies. Directions were immediately dispatched
to Sir Edward Hawke, that Byng should be sent home in
arrest: and an order to the same purpose was lodged at every
port in the kingdom: precautions, which, however unne∣cessary
to secure the person of a man who longed ardently
to justify his character by a publick tryal, were yet pro∣ductive
of considerable effect in augmenting the popular
odium. Admiral Byng immediately embarked in the ship
which had carried out his successor, and was accompanied
by Mr. West, General Fowke, and several other officers of
<PB N="465" REF="473"/>
that garrison, who were also recalled, in consequence of
having subscribed to the result of the council of war, which
we have mentioned above. When they arrived in Eng∣land,
Mr. West met with such a gracious reception from
his Majesty as was thought due to his extraordinary me∣rit;
but Mr. Byng was committed close prisoner in an
apartment of Greenwich-Hospital.</P>
<P>§ XIV. In the mean time, the siege of St. Philip's fort
in Minorca was prosecuted with unremitting vigour. The
a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mament of Toulon, consisting of the fleet commanded by
M. de la Galissonniere, and the troops under the Duke de
Richelieu, arrived on the eighteenth day of April at the
port of Ciudadella, on that part of the island opposite to
Mahon, or St. Philip's, and immediately began to disem∣bark
their forces. Two days before they reached the
island, General Blakeney had, by a packet-boat, received
certain intelligence of their approach, and began to make
preparations for the defence of the castle. The fort which
he commanded was very extensive, surrounded with nu∣merous
redoubts, ravelines, and other outworks; and pro∣vided
with subterranean galleries, mines, and traverses, cut
out of the solid rock with incredible labour. Upon the
whole, this was one of the best fortified places in Europe,
well supplied with artillery, ammunition, and provision;
and, without all doubt, might have sustained the most
desperate siege, had it been defended by a numerous gar∣rison,
conducted by able engineers, under the eye and
auspices of an active and skilful commander. All these
advantages, however, did not concur on this occasion.
The number of troops in Minorea did not exceed four re∣giments,
whereas, the nature of the works required at least
double the number; and, even of these above forty officers
were absent. The chief engineer was rendered lame by
the gout, and the general himself oppressed with the in∣firmities
of old age. The natives of the island might have
been serviceable as pioneers, or day-labourers; but, from
their hatred to the protestant religion, they were generally
<PB N="466" REF="474"/>
averse to the English government, although they had lived
happily and grown wealthy under its influence.</P>
<P>§ XV. The governor ordered his officers to beat up for
volunteers in the adjacent town of St. Philip's; but few
or none would inlist under his banners, and it seems he
would not venture to compel them into the service. He
recalled all his advanced parties; and, in particular, a
company posted at Fornelles, where a small redoubt had
been raised, and five companies at Ciudadella, a post for∣tified
with two pieces of cannon, which were now with∣drawn,
as soon as the enemy began to disembark their
forces. At the same time Major Cunningham was de∣tached
with a party to break down the bridges, and break
up the roads between that place and St. Philip's; but the
task of destroying the roads could not be performed in such
a hurry, on account of the hard rock which runs along the
surface of the ground through this whole island; nor was
there time to demolish the town of St. Philip's, which
stood so near the fort, that the enemy could not fail to take
advantage of its neighbourhood. The streets served them
for trenches, which otherwise could not have been dug
through the solid rock. Here they made a lodgement
close to the works; here they found convenient barracks
and quarters of refreshment, masks for their batteries, and
an effectual cover for their mortars and bombardiers. The
general has been blamed for leaving the town standing;
but if we consider his uncertainty concerning the destina∣tion
of the French armament, the odious nature of such
a precaution, which could not fail to exasperate the inha∣bitants,
and the impossibility of executing such a scheme
after the first appearance of the enemy, he will be found
excuseable, if not altogether blameless. Some houses and
windmills were actually demolished, so as to clear the
esplanade and the approaches. All the wine in the cellars
of St. Philip's town was destroyed, and the butts were car∣ried
into the castle, where they might serve for gabions
and traverses. Five-and-twenty Minorquin bakers were
hired, and a large number of cattle brought into the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sort,
<PB N="467" REF="475"/>
for the benefit of the garrison. The ports were walled up,
the post, assigned, the sentinels placed, and all the different
guards appointed. Commodore Edgecumbe, who then
anchored in the harbour of Mahon, close under the walls
of the castle, sailed away with his little squadron, consist∣ing
of the Chesterfield, Princess Louisa, Portland, and
Dolphin, after having left all his marines, a detachment
from Gibraltar, the whole crew of the Porcupine sloop, and
the greater part of the Dolphin's, as re-enforcement to the
fort, under the immediate direction and command of Capt.
Scroop, of the Dolphin, who, with great gallantry,
offered himself for this severe duty, and bravely signalised
himself during the whole siege. The French admiral
might certainly have blocked up this harbour in such
a manner as would have prevented the escape of these ships,
and divers other rich merchant vessels, which happened
then to be at Mahon: but, in all probability, they pur∣posely
allowed them to abandon the place, which, on any
emergency or assault, their crews and officers would have
considerably re-enforced. The enemy were prefectly ac∣quainted
with the great extent of the works, and the weak∣nets
of the garrison; from which circumstances they derived
the most sanguine hopes that the place might be suddenly
taken, without the trouble of a regular siege. After Mr.
Edgecumbe had sailed for Gibraltar, and General Blakeney
had ordered a sloop to be sunk in the channel that leads to
the harbour, the French squadron made its appearance at
this part of the island; but, without having attempted any
thing against the fort, sell to the leeward of Cape-Mola.
Next day they came in sight again, but soon bore away, and
never afterwards, during the whole course of the siege, ap∣proached
so near as to give the garrison the least disturbance.</P>
<P>§ XVI. On the twenty-second day of April, the gover∣nor
sent a drummer to the French general, with a letter, de∣siring
to know his reasons for invading the island. To this an
answer was returned by the Duke de Richelieu, declaring
he was come with intention to reduce the island under the
dominion of his most Christian Majesty, by way of re∣taliation
<PB N="468" REF="476"/>
for the conduct of his master, who had seised and
detained the ships belonging to the King of France and his
subjects.—If we may judge from the first operation of this
nobleman, he was but indifferently provided with en∣gineers;
for, instead of beginning his approaches on the
side of St. Philip's town, close by the outworks, where
he might have been screened from the fire of the garrison,
his batteries were erected at Cape Mola, on the other side
of the harbour, where they were more exposed, their fire
much less effectual, and indeed at too great a distance to
be of any service. The fire of St. Philip's was so severe,
and the cannon so well served on this quarter, that in a
little time the enemy thought proper to change their plan
of attack, and advance on the side of St. Philip's town,
which ought to have been the first object of their consider∣ation,
especially as they could find little or no earth to fill
their gabions, and open their trenches in the usual form.
On the twelfth of May, about nine at night, they opened
two bomb batteries, near the place where the windmills had
been destroyed; and from that period an incessant fire was
kept up on both sides, from mortars and cannon, the
French continuing to raise new batteries in every situation
from whence they could annoy the besieged.</P>
<P>§ XVII. On the seventeenth day of the month the garri∣son
were transported with joy at sight of the British squa∣dron,
commanded by Admiral Byng; and Mr. Boyd,
commissary of the stores, ventured to embark in a small
boat, with six oars, which passed from St. Stephen's cove,
a creek on the west side of the fortification, through a
shower of cannon and musketry from the enemy's post on
the other side, and actually reached the open <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea, his de∣sign
being to join the squadron; but this being at a great
distance, stretching away to the southward, and Mr. Boyd
perceiving himself chased by two of the enemy's light
vessels, he returned by the same route to the garrison,
without having sustained the least damage. A circum∣stance
which plainly confutes the notion of Mr. Byng,
that it was impracticable to open a communication with
<PB N="469" REF="477"/>
the garrison of St. Philip's. Next day the hopes of the be∣sieged,
which had prognosticated a naval victory to the
British squadron, a speedy relief to themselves, and no
less than captivity to the assailants, were considerably
damped by the appearance of the French fleet, which
quietly returned to their station off the harbour of Mahon.
That same evening they were told by a deserter, that the
English fleet had been worsted in an engagement by M∣de
la Galissonniere; and this information was soon con∣firmed
by a general discharge, or <HI>feu de joie,</HI> through the
whole French camp, to celebrate the victory they pretended
to have obtained. How little soever they had reason to
boast of any advantage in the action, the retreat of the
English squadron was undoubtedly equivalent to a victory:
for had Mr. Byng acquired and maintained the superiority
at sea, the French forces, which had been disembarked in
Minorca, would, in all probability, have been obliged to
surrender prisoners of war to his Britannick Majesty.
The case was now much altered in their favour: their
squadron cruised about the island without molestation:
and they daily received, by means of their transports, re∣enforcements
of men and ammunition, as well as constant
supplies of provisions.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. The English garrison, however mortified at
finding themselves thus abandoned, resolved to acquit them∣selves
with gallantry in the defence of the place, not with∣out
some remaining hope that the English squadron would
be re-enforced, and return to their relief. In the mean
time, they sustained and retorted the enemy's fire with
undaunted resolution. They remounted cannon, the
carriages of which had been disabled: they removed them
occasionally to places from whence it was judged they
could do the greatest execution: they repaired breaches,
restored merlons, and laboured with surprising alacrity,
even when they were surrounded by the numerous batteries
of the foe; when their embrasures, and even the para∣pets,
were demolished, and they stood exposed not only
to the cannon and mortars, but also to the musquetry, which
<PB N="470" REF="478"/>
fired upon them, without ceasing, from the windows of
the houses in the town of St. Philip. By this time, they
were invested with an army of twenty thousand men, and
plyed incessantly from sixty-two battering cannon, twenty-one
mortars, and four howitzers, besides the small arms:
nevertheless, the loss of men within the fortress was very
inconsiderable, the garrison being mostly secured in the
subterranean works, which were impenetrable to shells or
shot. By the twenty seventh day of June they had made a
practicable breach in one of the ravelins, and damaged the
other outworks to such a degree, that they determined this
night to give a general assault. Accordingly, between the
hours of ten and eleven, they advanced to the attack from
all quarters on the land-side. At the same time a strong
detachment, in armed boats, attempted to force the har∣bour,
and penetrate into the creek, called St. Stephen's
Cove, to storm Fort-Charles, and second the attack upon
Fort Marlborough, on the farther side of the creek, the
most detached of all the outworks. The enemy advanced
with great intrepidity, and their commander, the Duke
de Richelieu, is said to have led them up to the works
in person. Such an assault could not but be attended with
great slaughter: they were mowed down, as they approach∣ed,
with grape-shot and musquetry: and several mines were
sprung with great effect, so that the glacis was almost
covered with the dying and the dead. Nevertheless, they
persevered with uncommon resolution; and, though re∣pulsed
on every other side, at length made a lodgement in
the Queen's redoubt, which had been greatly damaged
by their cannon. Whether their success in this quarter
was owing to the weakness of the place, or to the timidity
of the defender, certain it is, the enemy were in possession
before it was known to the officers of the garrison; for
Lieutenant-Colonel Jeffries, the second in command, who
had acquitted him self since the beginning of the siege with
equal courage, skill, and activity, in his visitation of this
post, was suddenly surrounded and taken by a file of
French grenadiers, at a time when he never dreamed they
<PB N="471" REF="479"/>
had made a lodgment. Major Cunningham, who ac∣companied
him, met with a severer fate, though he es∣caped
capitivity: he was run through the arm with a
bayonet, and the piece being discharged at the same time,
shattered the bones of his hand in such a manner, that he
was maimed for life. In this shocking condition he re∣tired
behind a traverse, and was carried home to his quar∣ters.
Thus the governor was deprived of his two princi∣pal
assistants, one being taken, and the other disabled.</P>
<P>§ XIX. The enemy having made themselves masters
of Anstruther's and the Queen's redoubts, from which
perhaps they might have been dislodged, had a vigorous
effort been made for that purpose, before they had leisure
to secure themselves, the Duke de Richelieu ordered a par∣ley
to be beat, in order to obtain permission to bury the
dead, and remove the wounded. This request was granted
with more humanity than discretion, inasmuch as the
enemy took this opportunity to throw a re-enforcement of
men privately into the places where the lodgements had
been made, and these penetrated into the gallery of the
mines, which communicated with all the other outworks.
During this short cessation, General Blakeney summoned
a council of war, to deliberate upon the state of the fort
and garrison: and the majority declared for a capitulation.
The works were in many places ruined; the body of the
castle was shattered; many guns were dismounted, the em∣brasures
and parapets demolished, the pallisadoes broke in
pieces, the garrison exhausted with hard duty and incessant
watching, and the enemy in possession of the subterranean
communications. Besides, the governor had received in∣formation
from prisoners, that the Duke de Richelieu was
alarmed by a report that the Marshal Duke de Belleisle
would be sent to supersede him in the command, and for
that reason would hazard another desperate assault, which
it was the opinion of the majority the garrison could not
sustain. These considerations, added to the despair of
being relieved, induced him to demand a capitulation.
But this measure was not taken with the unanimous con∣sent
<PB N="472" REF="480"/>
of the council. Some officers observed, that the
garrison was very little diminished, and still in good
spirits: that no breach was made in the body of the castle,
nor a single cannon erected to batter in breach: that the
loss of an outwork was never deemed a sufficient reason for
surrendering such a fortress; that the counterscarp was
not yet taken, nor, on account of the rocky soil, could be
taken, except by assault, which would cost the enemy a
greater number than they had lost in their late attempt:
that they could not attack the ditch, or batter in breach,
before the counterscarp should be taken, and even then
they must have recourse to galleries before they could pass
the fossé, which was furnished with mines and counter∣mines:
finally, they suggested, that in all probability
the British squadron would be re-enforced, and sail back
to their relief; or, if it should not return, it was the
duty of the governor to defend the place to extremity,
without having any regard to the consequences. These
remarks being over-ruled, the chamade was beat, a con∣ference
ensued, and very honourable conditions were
granted to the garrison, in consideration of the gallant de∣fence
they had made. This it must be owned was vigorous
while it lasted, as the French general was said to have lost
five thousand men in the siege: whereas the loss of the
garrison, which at first fell short of three thousand men,
did not exceed one hundred. The capitulation imported
that the garrison should march out with all the honours of
war, and be conveyed by sea to Gibraltar. The French
were put in possession of one gate, as well as Fort Charles
and Marlborough redoubt; but the English troops re∣mained
in the other works till the seventh day of July,
when they embarked. In the mean time, reciprocal civi∣lities
passed between the commanders and officers of both
nations.</P>
<P>§ XX. The articles of capitulation were no sooner ex∣ecuted
than Monsieur de la Galissonniere sailed back to
Toulon, with all the prizes which had lain at anchor in
the harbour of Mahon since the fort of St. Philip was first
<PB N="473" REF="481"/>
invested. In all probability the safety of himself and his
whole squadron was owing to this expeditious retreat; for
in a few days after the surrender of the fort, Sir Edward
Hawke's fleet, augmented by five ships of the line, which
had been sent from England, when the first tidings ar∣rived
of Minorca's being invaded, now made its appear∣ance
off the island; but by this time Galissonniere was re∣tired,
and the English admiral had the mortification to
see the French colours flying upon St. Philip's castle.
What, perhaps, chagrined this gallant officer still more,
he was not provided with frigates, sloops, and small craft
to cruise round the island, and intercept the supplies which
were daily sent to the enemy. Had he reached Minorca
sooner, he might have discomfited the French squadron;
but he could not have raised the siege of St. Philip's,, be∣cause
the Duke de Richelieu had received his re-enforce∣ments,
and such a train of artillery as no fortification could
long withstand. Indeed, if the garrison had been con∣siderably
re-enforced, and the communication with it
opened by sea, the defence would have been protracted,
and so many vigorous sallies might have been made, that
the assailants would have had cause to repent of their en∣terprise.</P>
<P>§ XXI. When the news of the conquest was brought
to Versailles, by the Court of Egmont, whom the Duke
de Richelieu had dispatched for that purpose, the people of
France were transported with the most extravagant joy.
Nothing was seen but triumphs and processions; nothing
heard but anthems, congratulations, and hyperbolical
encomiums upon the conqueror of Minorca, who was
celebrated in a thousand poems and studied orations;
while the conduct of the English was vilified and ridiculed
in ballads, farces, and pasquinades. Nothing more argues
the degeneracy of a warlike nation than the pride of such
mean triumph for an advantage, which, in more vigorous
times, would scarce have been distinguished by the cere∣mony
of a <HI>Te Deum Laudamus.</HI> Nor is this childish ex∣ultation,
that disgraces the laurels of victory, confined to
<PB N="474" REF="482"/>
the kingdom of France. Truth obliges us to own, that
even the subjects of Great-Britain are apt to be elevated
by success into an illiberal insolence of self applause, and
contemptuous comparison. This must be condemned as
a proof of unmanly arrogance, and absurd self-conceit, by
all those who coolly reflect, that the events of war gene∣rally,
if not always, depend upon the genius or misconduct
of one individual. The loss of Minorca was severely felt
in England, as a national disgrace; but, instead of pro∣ducing
dejection and despondence, it excited an universal
clamour of rage and resentment, not only against Mr.
Byng, who had retreated from the French squadron; but
also in reproach of the administration, which was taxed
with having neglected the security of Minorca. Nay,
some politicians were inflamed into a suspicion, that this im∣portant
place had been negatively betrayed into the hands
of the enemy, that, in case the arms of Great-Britain
should prosper in other parts of the world, the French
King might have some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort of equivalent to restore for
the conquests which should be abandoned at the peace.
This notion, however, seems to have been conceived from
prejudice and party, which now began to appear with the
most acrimonious aspect, not only throughout the united
kingdoms in general, but even in the s—n's councils.</P>
<P>§ XXII. Sir Edward Hawke, being disappointed in his
hope of encountering La Galissonniere, and relieving the
English garrison of St. Philip's, at least asserted the em∣pire
of Great-Britain in the Mediterranean, by annoying
the commerce of the enemy, and blocking up their squa∣dron
in the harbour of Toulon. Understanding that the
Austrian government at Leghorn had detained an English
privateer, and imprisoned the captain, on pretence that he
had violated the neutrality of the port, he detached two
ships of war, to insist, in a peremptory manner, on the re∣lease
of the ship, effects, crew, and captain; and they
thought proper to comply with his demands, even without
waiting for orders from the court of Vienna. The person
in whose behalf the Admiral thus interposed, was one
<PB N="475" REF="483"/>
Fortunatis Wright, a native of Liverpool; who, though
a stranger to a sea-life, had, in the last war, equipped a
privateeer, and distinguished himself in such a manner, by
his uncommon vigilance and valour, that, if he had been
indulged with a command suitable to his genius, he would
have deserved as honourable a place in the annals of the
navy, as that which the French have bestowed upon their
boasted Guai Trouin, Du Bart, and Thurot. An un∣common
exertion of spirit was the occasion of his being
detained at this juncture. While he lay at anchor in the
harbour of Leghorn, commander of the St. George pri∣vateer
of Liverpool, a small ship of twelve guns and eighty
men, a large French xebeque, mounted with six∣teen
cannon, and nearly three times the number of his
complement, chose her station in view of the harbour, in
order to interrupt the British commerce. The gallant
Wright could not endure this insult: notwithstanding the
enemy's superiority in metal and number of men, he
weighed anchor, hoisted his sails, engaged him within
sight of the shore, and after a very obstinate dispute, in
which the captain, lieutenant, and above threescore of the
men belonging to the xebeque were killed on the spot, he
obliged them to sheer off, and returned to the harbour in
triumph. This brave corsair would, no doubt, have signa∣lised
himself by many other exploits, had not he, in the sequel,
been overtaken in the midst of his career by a dreadful storm,
in which the ship foundering, he and all his crew perished.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. Sir Edward Hawke, having scoured the Me∣diterranean,
and insulted the enemy's ports, returned with
the homeward-bound trade to Gibraltar; from whence,
about the latter end of the year, he set sail for England
with part of his squadron, leaving the rest in that bay, for
the protection of our commerce, which in those parts
soon began to suffer extremely from French privateers,
that now swarmed in the Mediterranean. General Blake∣ney
had arrived, with the garrison of Minorca, at Ports∣mouth
in the month of November, and been received with
expressions of tumultuous joy: every place through which
<PB N="476" REF="484"/>
he passed celebrated his return with bonefires, illuminations,
bell-ringing, and acclamations: every mouth was opened
in his praise, extolling him for the gallant defence he had
made in the castle of St. Philip. In a word, the people's
veneration for Blakeney increased in proportion to their
abhorrence of Byng: the first was lifted into an idol of
admiration, while the other sunk into an object of reproach;
and they were viewed at different ends of a false perspective,
through the medium of prejudice and passion; of a perspective
artfully contrived, and applied by certain m—rs for
the purposes of self-interest and deceit. The s—is
said to have been influenced by the prepossession of the
s—t. Mr. Blakeney met with a gracious reception
from his Majesty, who raised him to the rank of an Irish
baron, in consideration of his faithful services, while some
malcontents murmured at this mark of favour, as an un∣reasonable
sacrifice to popular misapprehension.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. In the beginning of the year, the measures
taken by the government in England seem to have been
chiefly dictated by the dread of an invasion, from which
the ministers did not think themselves secured by the
guard-ships and cruisers on different parts of the coast, or
the standing army of the kingdom, though re-enforced by
the two bodies of German auxiliaries. A considerable
number of new troops was levied: the success in recruiting
was not only promoted by the land-holders throughout the
kingdom, who thought their estates were at stake, and for
that reason encouraged their dependants to engage in the
service, but also in a great measure owing to a dearth of
corn, which reduced the lower class of labourers to such
distress, that some insurrections were raised, and many
inlisted with a view to obtain a livelihood, which otherwise
they could not earn. New ships of war were built, and
daily put in commission; but it was found impracticable
to man them, without having recourse to the odious and
illegal practice of impressing sailors, which must always be
a reproach to every free people. Notwithstanding large
bounties, granted by the government to volunteers, it was
<PB N="477" REF="485"/>
found necessary to lay an embargo upon all shipping, and
impress all the seamen that could be found, without any
regard to former protections; so that all the merchant-ships
were stripped of their hands, and foreign commerce for
some time wholly suspended. Nay, the expedient
of compelling men into the service was carried to an
unusual degree of oppression; for rewards were publickly
offered to those who should discover where any seaman lay
concealed: so that those unhappy people were in some re∣spects
treated like felons, dragged from their families and
connexions to confinement, mutilation, and death, and
totally cut off from the enjoyment of that liberty, which,
perhaps, at the expense of their lives, their own arms had
helped to preserve, in favour of their ungrateful country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At this juncture, a number of publick spirited merchants of the city of London, and others, formed themselves in a very laudable association, under the name of the Marine Society, and contributed considerable sums of mo∣ney for equipping such orphans, friendless, and forlorn boys, as were wil∣ling to engage in the service of the navy. In consequence of this excellent plan, which was executed with equal zeal and discretion, many thousands were rescued from misery, and rendered useful members of that society, of which they must have been the bane and the reproach, without this humane interposition.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>§ XXV. About eighty ships of the line and threescore
frigates were already equipped, and considerable bodies of
land forces assembled, when, on the third day of February,
a proclamation was issued, requiring all officers civil and
military, upon the first appearance of any hostile attempt
to land upon the coasts of the kingdom, immediately to
cause all horses, oxen, or cattle, which might be fit for
draft or burthen, and not actually employed in the
king's service, or in the defence of the country, and also (so
far as might be practicable) all other cattle and provisions,
to be driven and removed twenty miles at least from the
place where such hostile attempt should be made, and to
secure the same, so as that they might not fall into the
hands or power of those who should make such attempt;
regard being had, however, that the respective owners
should suffer as little damage as might be consistent with
the publick safety.</P>
<P><PB N="478" REF="486"/>
§ XXVI. As the ministry were determined to make their
chief efforts against the enemy in North-America, where
the first hostilities had been committed, and where the
strongest impression could be made, a detachment of two
regiments was sent thither under the conduct of General
Abercrombie, appointed as successor to General Shirley,
whom they had recalled, as a person no ways qualified to
conduct military operations: nor, indeed, could any suc∣cess
in war be expected from a man who had not been
trained to arms, nor ever acted but in a civil capacity.
But the command in chief of all the forces in America was
conferred upon the Earl of Loudoun, a nobleman of
amiable character, who had already distinguished himself
in the service of his country. Over and above this com∣mand,
he was now appointed governor of Virginia, and
colonel of a royal American regiment, consisting of four
battalions, to be raised in that country, and disciplined
by officers of experience, invited from foreign service. Mr.
Abercrombie set sail for America in March; but the Earl
of Loudoun, who directed in chief the plan of operations,
and was vested with power and authority little inferior to
those of a viceroy, did not embark till the latter end of
May.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. All these previous measures being taken, his
Majesty, in the course of the same month, thought proper
to publish a declaration of war<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the French ambassador returned to London, he proposed that or∣ders should be immediately dispatched to the English governors in America, with express orders to desist from any new undertaking, and all acts of hos∣tility; but with regard to the lands on the Ohio, to put, without delay, matters on the same sooting in which they stood before the late war, that the respective claims of both nations might be amicably referred to the com∣missaries at Paris. The British court agreed to the cessation of hostilities, and the discussion of the disputes in the ministers of the two crowns, on condition that all the possessions in America should be previously put in the situation prescribed by the treaty of Utrecht, confirmed by that of Aix-la-Chapelle. The French ministry, instead of complying with this condition, produced an evasive draft of a preliminary convention, and this was an∣swered by a counter-proposal; At length the ambassador of France demand∣ed, as preliminary conditions, that Great-Britain would renounce all claim the south coast of the river St. Laurence, and the lakes that discharge them∣selves into that river; cede to the French twenty leagues of country lying along the bay of Fundy, which divides Acadia, or Nova-Scotia; and all the land between the rivers Ohio and Ouabache. A memorial was afterwards presented on the same subject, including the affair of the neutral islands in the West-Indies; but this was amply refuted in another piece, in which the British ministry observed, that even at the very opening of the commissi∣on established in Paris, for terminating amicably the disputes in North-Ame∣rica, the French invaded Nova-Scotia, erected three forts in the heart of that province, and would have destroyed the English settlement at Halifax, had they not been prevented: That the like hostilities were committed up∣on his Britannick Majesty's subjects on the Ohio and Indian lakes, where the governors appointed by the French King, without any shadow of right, prohibited the English from trading; seised their traders by force, and sent them prisoners to France; invaded the territories of Virginia, attacked a fort that covered its frontier, and, to secure their usurpations, erected, with an armed force, a chain of forts on the lands which they had invaded. That his Britannick Majesty had complained of these hostilities to the court of Versailles, but without effect; so that he found himself obliged to provide for the security of his subjects; and as the encroachments made by France were hostile, it could never be unlawful, or irreconcileable with the assu∣rance of his Majesty's peaceable disposition, to repel an aggressor; and that the same motive of self defence had forced him to seise the French ships and sailors, in order to deprive that court of the means of making an invasion, with which their ministers in all the courts of Europe had menaced England.</NOTE> against the French King,
<PB N="479" REF="487"/>
importing, that, since the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the
usurpations and encroachments made upon the British ter∣ritories
in America had been notorious: That his Britan∣nick
Majesty had, in divers serious representations to the
court of Versailles, complained of these repeated acts of
violence, and demanded satisfaction; but notwithstanding
the repeated assurances given by the French King, that
every thing should be settled agreeably to the treaties sub∣sisting
between the two crowns, and particularly that the
evacuation of the four neutral islands in the West-Indies
should be effected, the execution of these assurances, and
of the treaties on which they were founded, had been
evaded under the most frivolous pretences: That the un∣justifiable
practice of the French governors, and officers
acting under their authority, were still continued, until
they broke out in open acts of hostility in the year one
thousand seven hundred and fifty-four; when in time of
profound peace, without any declaration of war, without
any previous notice given, or application made, a body of
<PB N="480" REF="488"/>
French troops, commanded by an officer bearing the
French King's commission, attacked in an hostile manner,
and took possession of, an English fort on the river Ohio
in North-America: That great naval armaments were
prepared in the ports of France, and a considerable body
of French troops embarked for that country: That al∣though
the French ambassador was sent back to England,
with specious professions of a desire to accommodate these
differences, it appeared their real design was only to
amuse, and gain time for the passage of these supplies and
re-enforcements, which they hoped would secure the su∣periority
of the French forces in America, and enable
them to carry their ambitious and oppressive projects into
execution: That, in consequence of the just and neces∣sary
measures taken by the King of Great-Britain for
preventing the success of such a dangerous design, the
French ambassador was immediately recalled from Eng∣land,
the fortifications of Dunkirk were enlarged, great
bodies of troops marched down to the sea-coasts of France,
and the British dominions threatened with an invasion:
That though the King of England, in order to frustrate
these intentions, had given orders for seising at sea the ships
of the French King and his subjects, yet he had hitherto
contented himself with detaining those ships which had
been taken, and preserving their cargoes entire, without
proceeding to confiscation; but it being at last evident,
from the hostile invasion of Minorca, that the court of
Versailles was determined to reject all proposals of accom∣modation,
and carry on the war with the utmost violence,
his Britannick Majesty could no longer, consistently with
the honour of his crown, and the welfare of his subjects,
remain within those bounds, which, from a desire of peace,
he had hitherto observed. A denunciation of war followed
in the usual form, and was concluded with an assurance,
that all the French subjects residing in Great-Britain and
Ireland, who should demean themselves dutifully to the go∣vernment,
might depend upon its protection, and be safe
in their persons and effects.</P>
<P><PB N="481" REF="489"/>
§ XXVIII. In the beginning of June the French King
declared war in his turn against his Britannick Majesty,
and his declaration was couched in terms of uncommon
asperity. He artfully threw a shade over the beginning of
hostilities in North-America, referring to a memorial which
had been delivered to the several courts of Europe, con∣taining
a summary of those facts which related to the pre∣sent
war, and the negociations by which it had been pre∣ceded.
He insisted on the attack made by the King of Eng∣land,
in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-four,
on the French possessions in North-America; and
afterwards by the English navy on the navigation and com∣merce
of the French subjects, in contempt of the law of
nations, and direct violation of treaties. He complained
that the French soldiers and sailors underwent the harsh∣est
treatment in the British isles, exceeding those bounds
which are prescribed to the most rigorous rights of war,
by the law of nature, and common humanity. He af∣firmed,
that while the English ministry, under the appear∣ance
of sincerity, imposed upon the French ambassador
with false protestations, orders diametrically opposite to
these deceitful assurances of a speedy accommodation were
actually carrying into execution in North-America: That
while the court of London employed every caballing art, and
squandred away the subsidies of England, to instigate other
powers against France, his most Christian Majesty did not
even ask of these powers the succours which guarantees and
defensive treaties authorised him to demand: but recom∣mended
to them such measures only as tended to their own
peace and security: That while the English navy, by the
most odious violences, and sometimes by the vilest artifices,
made captures of French vessels, navigating in full secu∣rity
under the safeguard of publick faith, in most Christian
Majesty released an English frigate taken by a French
squadron, and British vessels traded to the ports of
France without molestation: That the striking contrast
formed by these different methods of proceeding would
convince all Europe, that one court was guided by mo∣tives

of jealousy, ambition, and avarice: and that the con∣duct
of the other was founded on principles of honour,
justice, and moderation: That the vague imputations con∣tained
in the King of England's declaration, had in reality
no foundation; and the very manner in which they were set
forth would prove their futility and falsehood: That the
mention made of the works at Dunkirk, and the troops
assembled on the coasts of the ocean, implied the most gross
attempt to deceive mankind into a belief, that these were
the points which determined the King of England to issue
orders for seising the French vessels; whereas, the works at
Dunkirk were not begun till after two French ships of war
had been taken by an English squadron; and depredations
had been committed six months upon the subjects of France
before the first battalions began their march for the sea-side.
In a word, the most Christian King, laying aside
that politeness and decorum on which his people value
themselves above all the nations upon the face of the
earth, very roundly taxes his brother monarch's administra∣tion
with piracy, perfidy, inhumanity, and deceit. A
charge conveyed in such reproachful terms, against one of
the most respectable crowned heads in Europe, will appear
the more extraordinary and injurious, if we consider that
the accusers were well acquainted with the falsity of their
own imputations; and at the same time conscious of having
practised those very arts which they affected so much to
to decry. For, after all, it must be allowed, that no∣thing
could be justly urged against the English government,
with respect to France, except the omission of a mere form,
which other nations might interpret into an irregularity,
but could not construe into perfidious dealing, as the
French had previously violated the peace by their insolence
and encroachments.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. Whatever might have been the opinion of other
nations, certain it is, the subjects of Great-Britain heartily
approved of the hostilities committed and intended against
a people, whom they have always considered as their natu∣ral
enemies, and the incendiaries of Europe. They chear∣fully
<PB N="483" REF="493"/>
contributed to the expense of armaments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Immediately after the declaration of war, the French ships and cargoes which had been taken were tried, and condemned as legal prizes, exposed to publick sale, and their produce lodged in the Bank; but in what manner this money, amounting to a large sum, was distributed or employed, we have not been able to discover.</NOTE>, and
seemed to approve of their destination, in hopes of being
able to wipe off the disgraces they had sustained in the de∣feat
of Braddock, and the loss of Minorca. The last
event made a deep impression upon the minds of the com∣munity.
An address was presented to the King by the
lord-mayor, aldermen, and common-council of Lon∣don,
containing strong hints to the disadvantage of the mi∣nistry.
They expressed their apprehension, that the loss
of the important fortress of St. Philip and island of Minorca,
possessions of the utmost consequence to the commerce and
naval strength of Great-Britain, without any attempt by
timely and effectual succours to prevent or defeat an attack,
after such early notice of the enemy's intentions, and
when his Majesty's navy was so evidently superior to
their's, would be an indelible reproach on the honour of
the British nation. They expatiated upon the imminent
danger to which the British possessions in America were
exposed, by the mismanagement and delays which had at∣tended
the defence of those invaluable colonies, the object
of the present war, the principal source of the wealth and
strength of these kingdoms. They lamented the want
of a constitutional well-regulated militia, the most natural
and certain defence against all invaders whatsoever. They
signified their hope, that the authors of the late losses and
disappointments would be detected, and brought to condign
punishment; that his Majesty's known intentions of pro∣tecting
and defending his subjects in their rights and pos∣sessions
might be faithfully and vigorously carried into
execution; and the large supplies, so necessarily demand∣ed,
and so chearfully granted, might be religiously applied
to the defence of these kingdoms, their colonies, and their
commerce, as well as to the annoyance of their inveterate
and perfidious enemies, the only sure means of obtaining
<PB N="484" REF="494"/>
a lasting and honourable peace. In answer to this address
the King assured them, that he would not fail to do justice
upon any persons who should have been wanting in their
duty to him and their country; to enforce obedience and
discipline in his fleets and armies; and to support the
authority and respect due to his government. Remon∣strances
of the same kind were presented by different coun∣ties
and corporations; and the populace clamoured aloud
for enquiry and justice.</P>
<P>§ XXX. The first victim offered to the enraged multi∣tude
was the unfortunate General F—ke who had been
deputy-governor of Gibraltar, and behaved with remark∣able
conduct and integrity in the exercise of that impor∣tant
office, till that period, when he fell under the displea∣sure
of the government. He was now brought to trial
before a board of general officers, and accused of having
disobeyed the orders he had received from the secretary at
war in three successive letters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>To Lieut. Gen. <HI>F—ke,</HI> or, in his absence, to the Commander in Chief in his Majesty's garrison of <HI>Gibraltar.</HI></P></Q>

<P>I Wrote to you by General Stewart; if that order is not complied with, then you are now to make a detachment of seven hundred men out of your own regiment and Guise's; and also another detachment out of Pulteney's and Panmure's regiments, and send them on board the fleet for the relief of Ma∣hon. But if that order has been complied with, then you are to make only one detachment of seven hundred men, to be commanded by another lieute∣nant-colonel and major, and to send it to Mahon; and you are also to detain all such empty vessels as shall come into your harbour, and keep them in readiness for any further transportation of troops. I have also his royal high∣ness the Duke of Cumberland's commands, to desire that you will keep your garrison as alert as possible, during this critical time, and give such other assistance as may be in your power for the relief of Minorca; taking care, however, not to fatigue or endanger your own garrison.</P>
</LETTER></NOTE>, touching the relief of Mi∣norca.
<PB N="485" REF="495"/>
Mr. F—ke alledged in his own defence, that
the orders were confused and contradictory, and implied a
discretionary power: that the whole number of his garrison
did not exceed two thousand six hundred men, after he
had spared two hundred and seventy-five to the ships com∣manded
by Mr. Edgecumbe: that the ordinary duty of
the garrison requiring eight hundred men, the whole num∣ber
was not sufficient for three reliefs: that, if he had de∣tached
a battalion on board the fleet, he should not have
had above two reliefs, at a time when he believed the place
was in danger of being attacked, for good reasons, which
he did not think himself at liberty to mention: that his
orders being doubtful, he held a council of war, which
was of opinion, that as undoubted intelligence was re∣ceived
of the French army's being landed at Minorca, to
the number of between thirteen and sixteen thousand men,
and that a French squadron of sixteen ships was stationed
off the harbour, the sending a detachment equal to a bat∣talion
from Gibraltar would be an ineffectual supply for
the relief of the place, and a weakening of the garrison
<PB N="486" REF="496"/>
from which they must be sent. He observed, that supposing
the orders to have been positive, and seven hundred men
detached to Minorca, the number remaining at Gib∣raltar
would not have exceeded one thousand five hundred
and fifty-six: a deduction of seven hundred more, according
to the order of May the twelfth, would have left a remain∣der
of eight hundred and fifty-six: that the men daily on
duty in the garrison, including artificers and labourers in
the King's works, amounted to eight hundred and thirty-nine;
so that if he had complied with the orders as they
arrived, he would not have had more than seventeen men
over and above the number necessary for the daily work of
the garrison: thus, the important fortress of Gibraltar must,
at this critical conjuncture, have been left almost naked
and defenceless to the attempts of the enemy: and had
those detachments been actually sent aboard, it afterwards
appeared that they could not have been landed on the island
of Minorca. The order transmitted to General F—ke
to detain all empty vessels, for a further transportation of
troops, seems to have been superfluous; for it can hardly
be supposed he could have occasion for them, unless to
embark the whole garrison, and abandon the place. It
seems likewise to have been unnecessary to exhort the ge∣neral
to keep his garrison as alert as possible, during that
critical time; inasmuch as it would have been impossible
for the men to have enjoyed the least repose or intermission
of duty, had the orders been punctually and literally
obeyed. What other assistance it might have been in the
governor's power to give for the relief of Minorca, or in
what manner he could avoid fatiguing his garrison, while
there was an impossibility of relieving the guards, it is not
easy to comprehend. Be that as it may, when the trial
was finished, and the question put to acquit or suspend for
one year, the court was equally divided; and in such
cases the casting vote being vested in the president, he
threw it into the scale against the prisoner, whom his Ma∣jesty
thought fit to dismiss from his service.</P>
<P><PB N="487" REF="497"/>
§ XXXI. The expectation of the publick was now
eagerly turned towards America, the chief if not
the sole scene of our military operations. On the twenty-fifth
day of June, Mr. Abercrombie arrived at Albany, the
frontier of New-York, and assumed the command of the
forces there assembled, consisting of two regiments which
had served under Braddock, two battalions raised in Ame∣rica,
two regiments now transported from England, four
independent companies which had been many years main∣tained
in New-York, the New-Jersey regiment, four com∣panies
levied in North-Carolina, and a body of provincial
forces raised by the government of New-England. Those
to the southward, including Pennsylvania, Maryland,
and Virgina, had not yet determined on any regular plan
of operation, and were moreover hard pressed in defending
their western frontier from the French and Indians, who, in
skulking parties, made sudden irruptions upon their un∣guarded
settlements, burning, plundering, and massacring
with the most savage inhumanity. As for South-Carolina,
the proportion of negro-slaves to the number of white in∣habitants
was so great in that colony, that the government
could not, with any regard to the safety of the province,
spare any re-enforcement for the general enterprise. The
plan of this undertaking had been settled the preceding year
in a council of war held at New-York. There it was resolv∣ed
to attack the fort of Niagara, situated between the lakes
Ontario and Erie, in order to cut off the communication
between Canada, and Louisiana, and prevent the French
from supporting their new fortresses on the Ohio; to reduce
Ticonderago and Crown-Point, so that the frontier of New-York
might be delivered from the danger of an invasion,
and Great-Britain become master of the lake Champlain,
over which the forces might be transported in any future
attempt: to besiege Fort Du Quesne upon the Ohio; and
to detach a body of troops by the river Kennebec, to alarm
the capital of Canada. This plan was too extensive for
the number of troops which had been prepared: the season
was too far advanced before the regiments arrived from
<PB N="488" REF="498"/>
England, the different colonies were divided in their
opinions, and Mr. Abercrombie postponed the execution
of any important scheme till the arrival of Lord Loudoun,
who was daily expected. The reasons that delayed the
re-enforcement, and detained his lordship so long, we do
not pretend to explain; though we may be allowed to
observe, that many fair opportunities have been lost, by the
neglect and procrastination of an English ministry. Cer∣tain
it is, the unaccountable delay of this armament ren∣dered
it useless for a whole year, afforded time and leisure
to the enemy to take their precautions against any subse∣quent
attack, and, in the mean time, to proceed unmolested
in distressing the British settlements. Even before this
period, they had attacked and reduced a small post in the
country of the Five Nations, occupied by twenty five Eng∣lishmen,
who were cruelly butchered to a man, in the
midst of those Indians whom Great-Britain had long
numbered among her allies.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. Soon after this expedition, having received
intelligence that a considerable convoy of provisions and
stores, for the garrison of Oswego, would in a little time
set out from Schenectady, and be conveyed in batteaux up
the river Onondaga, they formed an ambuscade among
the woods and thickets on the north side of that river; but
understanding the convoy had passed before they reached
the place, they resolved to wait the return of the detach∣ment.
Their design, however, was frustrated by the vigi∣lance
and valour of Colonel Bradstreet, who expected
such an attempt, and had taken his measures accordingly.
On the third day of July, while he stemmed the stream of
the river, with his batteaux formed into three divisions,
they were saluted with the Indian war-whoop, and a
general discharge of musquetry from the north shore.
Bradstreet immediately ordered his men to land on the
opposite bank, and with a few of the foremost took pos∣session
of a small island, where he was forthwith attacked
by a party of the enemy, who had forded the river for that
purpose; but these were soon repulsed. Another body
<PB N="489" REF="499"/>
having passed a mile higher, he advanced to them at the
head of two hundred men, and fell upon them, sword in
hand, with such vigour, that many were killed on the spot,
and the rest driven into the river with such precipitation,
that a considerable number of them were drowned. Having
received information that a third body of them had passed
at a ford still higher, he marched thither without hesitation,
and pursued them to the other side, where they were en∣tirely
routed and dispersed. In this action, which lasted
near three hours, about seventy of the batteau-men were
killed or wounded: but the enemy lost double the number
killed, and above seventy taken prisoners. In all proba∣bility
the whole detachment of French, amounting to
seven hundred men, would have been cut off, had not a
heavy rain interposed, and disabled Colonel Bradstreet
from following his blow; for that same night he was
joined by Captain Patten, with his grenadiers, in
his march from Oneida to Oswego, and next morning re-enforced
with two hundred men, detached to his assist∣ance
from the garrison of Oswego, but by this time the
rivulets were so swelled by the rain, that it was found im∣practible
to pursue the enemy through the woods and
thickets. Patten and his grenadiers accompanied the de∣tachment
to Oswego, while Bradstreet pursued his voyage
to Schenectady, from whence he repaired to Albany, and
communicated to General Abercrombie the intelligence
he had received from the prisoners, that a large body of the
enemy were encamped on the eastern side of the lake On∣tario,
provided with artillery, and all other implements, to
besiege the fort of Oswego.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. In consequence of this information, Major-General
Webb was ordered to hold himself in readiness to
march with one regiment to the relief of that garrison;
but, before they could be provided with necessaries, the
Earl of Loudoun arrived at the head-quarters at Albany, on
the twenty-ninth day of July. The army at this time is
said to have consisted of regular troops to the number of
two thousand six hundred, about seven thousand provin∣cials,
supposed to be in readiness to march from Fort
<PB N="490" REF="500"/>
William-Henry, under the command of General Winslow,
over and above a considerable number of batteau men at
Albany and Schenectady. The garrison at Oswego amount∣ed
to fourteen hundred soldiers, besides three hundred
workmen and sailors, either in the fort, or posted in small
parties between the fort and a place called Burnet's field,
to secure a safe passage through the country of the Six
Nations, upon whose friendship there was no longer any
reliance. By the best accounts received of the enemy's
force, they had about three thousand men at Crown-Point
and Ticonderago upon the lake Champlain: but their
chief strength was collected upon the banks of the lake
Ontario, where their purpose undoubtedly was to reduce
the English fort at Oswego. The immediate object,
therefore, of Lord Loudoun's attention was the relief of
this place; but his design was strenously opposed by the
province of New-York, and other northern governments,
who were much more intent upon the reduction of Crown-Point,
and the security of their own frontiers, which they
apprehended was connected with this conquest. They
insisted upon Winslow's being joined by some regiments
of regular troops before he should march against this for∣tress;
and stipulated that a body of reserve should be de∣tained
at Albany, for the defence of that frontier, in case
Winslow should fail in his enterprise and be defeated. At
length they agreed, that the regiment which Mr. Aber∣crombie
had destined for that purpose should be detached
to the relief of Oswego; and on the twelfth day of Au∣gust
Major-General Webb began his march with it from
Albany: but on his arrival at the Carrying-place, between
the Mohock's river and Wood's-creek, he received the
disagreeable new that Oswego was taken, and the gar∣rison
made prisoners of war. Mr. Webb, apprehending
himself in danger of being attacked by the besieging army,
began immediately to render the creek impassable, even to
canoes, by felling trees, and throwing them into the
stream; while the enemy, ignorant of his numbers, and
apprehensive of a like visitation from him, took the very
<PB N="491" REF="501"/>
same method of preventing his approach: in consequence
of this apprehension, he was permitted to retire unmolested.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. The loss of the two small forts, called On∣tario
and Oswego, was a considerable national misfortune.
They were erected on the south side of the great lake On∣tario,
standing on opposite sides, at the mouth of the
Onondago river, that discharges itself into the lake, and
constituted a post of great importance, where vessels had
been built, to cruise upon the lake, which is a kind of inland
sea, and interrupt the commerce as well as the motions
and designs of the enemy. The garrison, as we have
already observed, consisted of fourteen hundred men,
chiefly militia and new-raised recruits, under the command
of Lieutenant-Colonel Mercer, an officer of courage and
experience: but the situation of the forts was very ill
chosen; the materials mostly timber, or logs of wood; the
defences wretchedly contrived, and unfinished; and, in a
word, the place altogether untenable against any regular
approach. Such were the forts which the enemy wisely
resolved to reduce. Being under no apprehension for
Crown-Point, they assembled a body of troops, consisting
of thirteen hundred regulars, seventeen hundred Canadians,
and a considerable number of Indian auxiliaries, under the
command of the Marquis de Montcalm, a vigilant and
enterprising officer, to whom the conduct of the siege was
entrusted by the Marquis de Vaudreuil, governor and
lieutenant-general of New France. The first step taken
by Montcalm was to block up Oswego by water with two
large armed vessels, and post a strong body of Canadians
on the road between Albany and the forts, to cut off all
communication of succour and intelligence. In the mean
time, he embarked his artillery and stores upon the lake,
and landed them in the bay of Nixouri, the place of
general rendezvous. At another creek, within half a
league of Oswego, he erected a battery for the protection
of his vessels, and on the twelfth day of August, at mid∣night,
after his dispositions had been made, he opened the
trenches before Fort-Ontario. The garrison having fired
<PB N="492" REF="502"/>
away all their shells and ammunition, spiked up the can∣non,
and deserting the fort, retired next day across the
river into Oswego, which was even more exposed than the
other, especially when the enemy had taken possession of
Ontario, from whence they immediately began to fire
without intermission. Colonel Mercer being, on the thir∣teenth,
killed by a cannon-ball, the fort destitute of all
cover, the officers divided in opinion, and the garrison in
confusion, they next day demanded a capitulation, and
surrendered prisoners of war, on condition that they should
be exempted from plunder, conducted to Montreal, and
treated with humanity. These conditions, however, the
Marquis did not punctually observe. The British officers
and soldiers were insulted by the savage Indians, who rob∣bed
them of their clothes and baggage, massacred several
men as they stood defenceless on the parade, assassinated
Lieutenant De la Court as he lay wounded in his tent,
under the protection of a French officer, and barbarously
scalped all the sick people in the hospital: finally, Mont∣calm,
in direct violation of the articles, as well as in con∣tempt
of common humanity, delivered up above twenty
men of the garrison to the Indians, in lieu of the same
number they had lost during the siege: and, in all pro∣bability,
these miserable captives were put to death by those
barbarians with the most excruciating tortures, according
to the execrable custom of the country. Those who
countenance the perpetration of cruelties, at which human
nature shudders with horrour, ought to be branded as infa∣mous
to all posterity. Such, however, were the trophies
that, in the course of the American war, distinguished the
operations of a people who pique themselves upon polite∣ness,
and the virtues of humanity. The prisoners taken
at Oswego, after having been thus barbarously treated, were
conveyed in batteaux to Montreal, where they had no
reason to complain of their reception; and, before the
end of the year, they were exchanged. The victors im∣mediately
demolished the two forts (if they deserved that
denomination) in which they found one hundred and
<PB N="493" REF="503"/>
twenty-one pieces of artillery, fourteen mortars, with a
great quantity of ammunition, warlike stores, and pro∣vision,
besides two sloops, and two hundred batteaux, which
likewise fell into their hands. Such an important maga∣zine,
deposited in a place altogether indefensible, and
without the reach of immediate succour, was a flagrant
proof of egregious folly, temerity, and misconduct.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. The Earl of Loudoun, finding the season
too far advanced to admit of any enterprise against the
enemy, exerted all his endeavours in making preparations
for an early campaign in the spring, in securing the fron∣tiers
of the English colonies, in forming an uniform plan
of action, and promoting a spirit of harmony among the
different governments, which had been long divided by
jarring interests, and other sources of dissention. Mean
while, the forts Edward and William-Henry were put in a
proper posture of defence, and secured with numerous
garrisons; and the forces put into winter-quarters at Al∣bany,
where comfortable barracks were built for that pur∣pose.
Fort-Granville, on the confines of Pennsylvania, an
inconsiderable blockhouse, was surprised by a party of
French and Indians, who made the garrison prisoners, con∣sisting
of two-and-twenty soldiers, with a few women and
children. These they loaded with flour and provision,
and drove into captivity; but the fort they reduced to
ashes. Many shocking murthers were perpetrated upon
defenceless people, without distinction of age or sex, in
different parts of the frontiers: but these outrages were
in some measure balanced by the advantages resulting
from a treaty of peace, which the governor of Pennsylva∣nia
concluded with the Delaware Indians, a powerful
tribe that dwell upon the river Sasquehanna, forming, as
it were, a line along the southern skirts of the province.
At the same time the governor of Virginia secured the friend∣ship
and alliance of the Cherokees and Catawbas, two pow∣erful
nations adjoining to that colony, who were able to bring
three thousand fighting men into the field. All these
circumstances considered, Great-Britain had reason to
<PB N="494" REF="504"/>
expect that the ensuing campaign would be vigorously
prosecuted in America, especially as a fresh re-enforcement
of troops, with a great supply of warlike stores was sent
to that country in fourteen transports, under convoy of
two ships of war, which sailed from Cork, in Ireland,
about the beginning of November.</P>
<P>§ XXXVI. No action of great importance distinguished
the naval transactions of this year on the side of America.
In the beginning of June, Captain Spry, who commanded
a small squadron, cruising off Louisbourg, in the island of
Cape-Breton, took the Arc en Ciel, a French ship of
fifty-guns, having on board near six hundred men, with
a large quantity of stores and provisions for the garrison.
He likewise made prize of another French ship, with seven∣ty
soldiers, two hundred barrels of powder, two large brass
mortars, and other stores of the like destination. On the
twenty-seventh day of July Commodore Holmes, being in
the same latitude, with two large ships and a couple of
sloops, engaged two French ships of the line and four fri∣gates,
and obliged them to sheer off, after an obstinate dis∣pute.
A great number of privateers were equipped in this
country, as well as in the West-India islands belonging to
the crown of Great-Britain; and as those seas swarmed
with French vessels, their cruises proved very advantage∣ous
to the adventurers.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. Scenes of higher import were this year acted
by the British arms in the East-Indies. The cessation of
hostilities between the English and French companies on
the peninsula of Indus, though it encouraged Mr. Clive to
visit his native country, was not of long duration; for in
a few months both sides recommenced their operations, no
longer as auxiliaries to the princes of the country, but as
principals and rivals, both in arms and commerce. Major
Laurence, who now enjoyed the chief command of the
English forces, obtained divers advantages over the enemy;
and prosecuted his success with such vigour, as, in all
probability, would in a little time have terminated the
war according to his own wish, when the progress of his
<PB N="495" REF="505"/>
arms was interrupted and suspended by an unfortunate
event at Calcutta, the cause of which is not easily ex∣plained:
for extraordinary pains have been taken to throw
a veil over some transactions, from whence this calamity
was immediately or remotely derived.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. The old Suba or viceroy of Bengal,
Bahar, and Orixa, dying in the month of April, in the
year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-six, was suc∣ceeded
by his adopted son, Sur Raja al Dowlat, a young
man of violent passions, without principle, fortitude, or
good faith, who began his administration with acts of per∣fidy
and violence. In all probability, his design against
the English settlements was suggested by his rapacious dis∣position,
on a belief that they abounded with treasure; as
the pretences which he used for commencing hostilities
were altogether inconsistent, false, and frivolous. In the
month of May, he caused the English factory at Cassim∣buzar
to be invested, and inviting Mr. Watts, the chief
of the factory, to a conference, under the sanction of a
safe conduct, detained him as prisoner; then, by means of
fraud and force intermingled, made himself master of the
factory. This exploit being atchieved, he made no secret of
his design to deprive the English of all their settlements.
With this view he marched to Calcutta, at the head of a
numerous army, and invested the place, which was then in
no posture of defence.</P>
<P>§ XXXIX. The governor, intimidated by the number
and power of the enemy, abandoned the fort, and with
some principal persons residing in the settlement, took
refuge on board a ship in the river, carrying along with
them their most valuable effects, and the books of the com∣pany.
Thus the defence of the place devolved to Mr.
Holwell, the second in command, who with the assistance
of a few gallant officers, and a very feeble garrison, main∣teined
it with uncommon courage and resolution against
several attacks, until he was overpowered by numbers, and
the enemy had forced their way into the castle. Then he
was obliged to submit; and the Suba, or viceroy, promised
<PB N="496" REF="506"/>
on the word of a soldier, that no injury should be done to
him or his garrison. Nevertheless, they were all driven,
to the number of one hundred and forty six persons of both
sexes, into a place called the Black-Hole prison, a cube of
about eighteen feet, walled up to the eastward and south∣ward,
the only quarters from which they could expect the
least refreshing air, and open to the westward by two win∣dows
strongly barred with iron, through which there was
no perceptible circulation. The humane reader will
conceive with horrour the miserable situation to which they
must have been reduced, when thus stewed up in a close
sultry night under such a climate as that of Bengal, espe∣cially
when he reflects that many of them were wounded,
and all of them fatigued with hard duty. Transported
with rage to find themselves thus barbarously cooped up
in a place where they must be exposed to suffocation,
those hapless victims endeavoured to force open the door,
that they might rush upon the swords of the barbarians by
whom they were surrounded: but all their efforts were
ineffectual; the door was made to open inwards, and being
once shut upon them, the crowd pressed upon it so strongly
as to render all their endeavours abortive: then they were
overwhelmed with distraction and despair. Mr. Holwell,
who had placed himself at one of the windows, accosted a
Jemmautdaar, or serjeant of the Indian guard, and having
endeavoured to excite his compassion, by drawing a pa∣thetick
picture of their sufferings, promised to gratify him
with a thousand rupees in the morning, if he could find
means to remove one half of them into a separate apart∣ment.
The soldier, allured by the promise of such a re∣ward,
assured him he would do his endeavour for their
relief, and retired for that purpose, but in a few minutes
returned, and told him that the Suba, by whose order alone
such a step could be taken, was asleep, and no person
durst disturb his repose. By this time a profuse sweat had
broke out on every individual, and this was attended with
an insatiable thirst, which became the more intolerable as
the body was drained of its moisture. In vain those
<PB N="497" REF="507"/>
miserable objects stripped themselves of their clothes,
squatted down on their hams, and fanned the air with their
hats, to produce a refreshing undulation. Many were una∣ble
to to rise again from this posture, but falling down were
trod to death, or suffocated. The dreadful symptom of
thirst was now accompanied with a difficulty of respiration,
and every individual gasped for breath. Their despair
became outrageous: again they attempted to force the
door, and provoke the guard to fire upon them by execra∣tion
and abuse. The cry of “Water! Water!” issued
from every mouth. Even the Jemmautdaar was moved to
compassion at their distress. He ordered his soldiers to
bring some skins of water, which served only to enrage the
appetite, and increase the general agitation. There was
no other way of conveying it through the windows but
by hats, and this was rendered ineffectual by the eagerness
and transports of the wretched prisoners, who at sight of
it struggled and raved even into fits of delirium. In con∣sequence
of these contests, very little reached those who
stood nearest the windows, while the rest, at the farther end
of the prison, were totally excluded from all relief, and
continued calling upon their friends for assistance, and con∣juring
them by all the tender ties of pity and affection.
To those who were indulged, it proved pernicious; for,
instead of allaying their thirst, it enraged their impatience
for more. The confusion became general and horrid;
all was clamour and contest; those who were at a distance
endeavoured to force their passage to the window, and the
weak were pressed down to the ground, never to rise again.
The inhuman ruffians without derived entertainment
from their misery: they supplied the prisoners with more
water, and held up lights close to the bars, that they might
enjoy the inhuman pleasure of seeing them fight for the
baneful indulgence. Mr. Holwell, seeing all his particu∣lar
friends lying dead around him, and trampled upon by
the living, finding himself wedged up so close as to be de∣prived
of all motion, begged, as the last instance of their
regard, that they would remove the pressure, and allow
him to retire from the window, that he might die in
<PB N="498" REF="508"/>
quiet. Even in those dreadful circumstances, which might
be supposed to have levelled all distinction, the poor de∣lirious
wretches manifested a respect for his rank and cha∣racter:
they forthwith gave way, and he forced his passage
into the centre of the place, which was not crowded so
much, because, by this time, about one third of the num∣ber
had perished, and lay in little compass on the floor,
while the rest still crowded to both windows. He retired
to a platform at the farther end of the room, and lying
down upon some of his dead friends, recommended his
soul to heaven. Here his thirst grew insupportable; his
difficulty in breathing increased, and he was seised with a
strong palpitation. These violent symptoms, which he
could not bear, urged him to make another effort: he
forced his way back to the window, and cried aloud,
“Water! for God's sake!” He had been supposed already
dead by his wretched companions, but finding him still alive,
they exhibited another extraordinary proof of tenderness and
regard to his person: “give him water,” they cried; nor
would one of them attempt to touch it until he had drank.
He now breathed more freely, and the palpitation ceased:
but finding himself still more thirsty after drinking, he
abstained from water, and moistened his mouth from time
to time, by sucking the perspiration from his shirt sleeves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In his despair of obtaining water, this unhappy gentleman had at∣tempted to drink his own urine: but sound it intolorably bitter; where∣as the moisture that slowed from the pores of his body was soft, pleasant, and refreshing.</NOTE>.
The miserable prisoners, perceiving that water rather ag∣gravated
than relieved their distress, grew clamorous for
air, and repeated their insults to the guard, loading the
Suba and his governor with the most virulent reproach.
From railing, they had recourse to prayer, beseeching
heaven to put an end to their misery. They now began
to drop on all hands; but then a steam arose from the
living, and the dead, as pungent and volatile as spirit of
hartshorn; so that all who could not approach the win∣dows
were suffocated. Mr. Holwell being weary of life,
retired once more to the platform, and stretched himself by
the Rev. Mr. Jervas Bellamy, who, together with his son,
a lieutenant, lay dead in each others's embrace. In this
<PB N="499" REF="509"/>
situation he was soon deprived of sense, and lay to all ap∣pearance
dead till day broke, when his body was discovered,
and removed by his surviving friends to one of the win∣dows,
where the fresh air revived him, and he was restored
to his sight and senses. The Suba, at last, being informed
that the greater part of the prisoners were suffocated, en∣quired
if the chief was alive; and being answered in the
affirmative, sent an order for their immediate release, when
no more than twenty-three survived of an hundred and
forty-six who had entered alive.</P>
<P>§ XL. Nor was the late deliverance, even of these few,
owing to any sentiment of compassion in the viceroy. He
had received information, that there was a considerable trea∣sure
secreted in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort, and that Mr. Holwell knew the
place where it was deposited. That gentleman, who,
with his surviving companions, had been seised with a
putrid fever immediately upon their release, was dragged
in that condition before the inhuman Suba, who questioned
him about the treasure, which existed no where but in his
own imagination; and would give no credit to his pro∣testations,
when he solemnly declared he knew of no such
deposit. Mr. Holwell and three of his friends were loaded
with fetters, and conveyed three miles to the Indian camp,
where they lay all night, exposed to a severe rain: next
morning they were brought back to town, still manacled,
under the scorching beams of a sun intensely hot; and
must infallibly have expired, had not nature expelled the
fever in large painful boils, that covered almost the whole
body. In this piteous condition they were embarked in an
open boat for Muxadabad, the capital of Bengal, and im∣derwent
such cruel treatment and misery in their passage,
as would shock the humane reader, should he peruse the
particulars. At Muxadabad they were led through the
city in chains, as a spectacle to the inhabitants, lodged in
an open stable, and treated for some days as the worst of
criminals. At length the Suba's grandmother interposed
her mediation in their behalf; and as that prince was by
this time convinced that there was no treasure concealed
<PB N="500" REF="510"/>
at Calcutta, he ordered them to be set at liberty. When
some of his sycophants opposed this indulgence, repre∣senting
that Mr. Holwell had still enough left to pay a
considerable ransom, he replied with some marks of com∣punction
and generosity, “If he has any thing left, let
him keep it; his sufferings have been great: he shall
have his liberty.” Mr. Holwell and his friends were
no sooner unfettered, than they took water for the Dutch
Tankfall or mint, in the neighbourhood of the city,
where they were received with great tenderness and hu∣manity.
The reader, we hope, will excuse us for having
thus particularised a transaction so interesting and extra∣ordinary
in all its circumstances. The Suba having de∣stroyed
Calcutta, and dispersed the inhabitants, extorted
large sums from the French and Dutch factories, that he
might display a spirit of impartiality against all the Euro∣peans,
even in his oppression, and returned to his city of
Muxadabad in triumph. By the reduction of Calcutta,
the English East-India company's affairs were so much
embroiled in that part of the world, that perhaps nothing
could have retrieved them but the interposition of a nation∣al
force, and the good fortune of a Clive, whose enter∣prises
were always crowned with success.</P>
<P>§ XLI. As the English East-India company had, for a
whole century, been at a considerable expense in maintain∣ing
a marine force at Bombay, to protect their ships from
the piracies of the Angrias, who had rendered themselves
independent princes, and fortified Geriah in that neigh∣bourhood;
many unsuccessful attempts had been made to
destroy their naval power, and reduce the fortress, under
which they always took shelter. In the year one thousand
seven hundred and fifty-four, the fleet of Tullagee Angria,
the reigning prince, attacked three Dutch ships of force,
which they either took or destroyed. Elated with this
success, he boasted that he should in a little time sweep
the seas of the Europeans, and began to build some large
ships, to re-enforce his grabs and gallivats, which were
the vessels on which he had formerly depended. Next year
<PB N="501" REF="511"/>
his neighbours, the Mahrattas, having signified to the
presidency at Bombay, that they were disposed to join in
the necessary service of humbling this common enemy, so
formidable to the whole Malabar coast, Commodore James
was detached with some ships of force to attack Angria,
in conjunction with those allies. They accordingly joined
him with seven grabs and sixty gallivats. They proceeded
to the harbour of Severndroog, where Angria's fleet lay
at anchor: but they no sooner received intelligence of his
approach, than they slipped their cables, and stood out to
sea. He chased them with all the canvass he could carry;
but their vessels being lighter than his, they escaped; and
he returned to Severndroog, which is a fortress situated on
an island within musket shot of the main land, strongly,
but irregularly fortified, and mounted with fifty four
pieces of cannon. There were three other small forts on
the continent, the largest of which was called Goa. On
the second day of April, the Commodore began to batter
and bombard the island, fort, and Fort Goa, at the same
time. That of Severndroog was set on fire; one of the
magazines blew up: a general conflagration ensued: the
garrison were overwhelmed with fire and confusion; the
English seamen landed under cover of the fire from the
ships, and took the place by storm with very little loss.
The other forts were immediately surrendered, and all of
these by treaty delivered to the Mahrattas. On the eighth
of April, the Commodore anchored off Bancote, now
called Fort Victoria, one of the most northern parts of
Angria's dominions, which surrendered without opposition,
and still remains in the hands of the English East-India
company, by the consent of the Mahrattas. The harbour
is good, and here is a great trade for salt and other com∣modities
sent hither from Bombay.</P>
<P>§ XLII. It was in November following, that the squa∣dron
under Admiral Watson arrived at Bombay, where
it was resolved to give Angria the finishing stroke, still in
conjunction with the Mahrattas. Mean while Commodore
James was sent to reconnoitre Geriah, the capital of his
<PB N="502" REF="512"/>
dominions, and to sound the depth of the harbour; a
service which he successfully performed. The admiral
being joined by a division of ships, fitted out at the com∣pany's
expense, having on board a body of troops com∣manded
by Golonel Clive, sailed on the seventh day of
February, and found in the neighbourhood of Geriah the
Mahratta fleet, consisting of four grabs, and forty smaller
vessels, called gallivats, lying to the northward of the
place, in a creek called Rajipore; and a land-army of
horse and foot, amounting to seven or eight thousand men,
the whole commanded by Rhamagee Punt, who had already
taken one small fort, and was actually treating about the
surrender of Geriah. Angria himself had quitted the
place; but his wife and family remained under the pro∣tection
of his brother-in-law; who, being summoned to
surrender by a message from the admiral, replied, that he
would defend the place to the last extremity. In conse∣quence
of this refusal the whole English fleet, in two di∣visions,
sailed on the twelfth-day of February into the
harbour, and sustained a warm fire from the enemy's batte∣ries
as they passed, as well as from the grabs posted in the
harbour for that purpose: this, however, was soon
silenced after the ships were brought to their stations, so as
to return the salutation. Between the hours of four and
five in the afternoon, a shell being thrown into one of
Angria's armed vessels, set her on fire; and the flames
communicating to the rest, they were all destroyed: be∣tween
six and seven the fort was set on fire by another
shell; and soon after the firing ceased on both sides. The
admiral, suspecting that the governor of the place would
surrender it to the Mahrattas rather than to the English,
disembarked all the troops under Mr. Clive, that he might
be at hand, in case of emergency, to take possession. In the
mean time, the fort was bombarded; the line of battle
ships were warped near enough to batter in breach; and
then the admiral sent an officer, with a flag of truce to the
governor, requiring him to surrender. His proposal being
again rejected, the English ships renewed their fire next
<PB N="503" REF="513"/>
day with redoubled vigour. About one o'clock the maga∣zine
of the fort blew up, and at four the garrison hung
out a white flag for capitulation. The parley that ensued
proving ineffectual, the engagement began again, and
continued till fifteen minutes after five: when the white
flag was again displayed, and now the governor submitted
to the terms which were imposed. Angria's flag was im∣mediately
hauled down; and two English captains taking
possession of the fort with a detachment, forthwith hoisted
the British ensign. To these captains, whose names
were Buchannan and Forbes, the Mahrattas offered a bribe
of fifty thousand rupees, if they would allow them to pass
their guard, that they might take possession of the fort for
themselves; but this offer was rejected with disdain, and
immediately disclosed to Colonel Clive, who took effectual
measures to frustrate their design. In this place, which
was reduced with very inconsiderable loss, the conquerors
found above two hundred cannon, six brass mortars, a
large quantity of ammunition, with money and effects
to the value of one hundred and thirty thousand pounds.
The fleet which was destroyed consisted of eight grabs, one
ship finished, two upon the stocks, and a good number
of gallivats. Among the prisoners, the admiral found
Angria's wife, children, and mother, towards whom he
demeaned himself with great humanity. Three hundred
European soldiers, and as many sepoys, were left to guard
the fort; and four of the company's armed vessels remained
in the harbour for the defence of the place, which was ex∣tremely
well situated for commerce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the admiral entered their apartment, the whole family shedding floods of tears fell with their faces to the ground; from which being ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ed, the mother of Angria told him, in a piteous tone, the people had no king, she no son, her daughter no husband, their children no father. The admiral replying, “then must look upon him as their father and their friend;” the youngest boy, about six years of age, seised him by the hand, and sobbing exclaimed, “then you shall be may father.” Mr. Wat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on was so affected with this pathetick address, that the tears trickled down his cheeks, while he assured them they might depend upon his protection and friendship.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="504" REF="514"/>
§ XLIII. The admiral and Mr. Clive sailed back to
Madrass in triumph, and there another plan was formed
for restoring the company's affairs upon the Ganges, re∣covering
Calcutta, and taking vengeance on the cruel
viceroy of Bengal. In October they set sail again for the
bottom of the bay; and about the beginning of December
arrived at Balasore, in the kingdom of Bengal. Having
crossed the Braces, they proceeded up the river Ganges as
far as Falta, where they found Governor Drake, and the
other persons who had escaped on board of the ships when
Calcutta was invested. Colonel Clive was disembarked
with his forces, to attack the fort of Busbudgia by land,
while the admiral battered it by sea: but the place being
ill provided with cannon, did not hold out above an hour
after the firing began. This conquest being atchieved at a
very easy purchase, two of the great ships anchored be∣tween
Tanna fort and a battery on the other side of the
river, which were abandoned before one shot was dis∣charged
against either; thus the passage was laid open to
Calcutta, the reduction of which we shall record among
the transactions of the ensuing year</P>
