garrisoned by King <HI>Charles</HI> I. under the

great Use, that it commanded the great
Roads from the West to <HI>London,</HI> and from
<HI>Oxford</HI> to <HI>Newbury,</HI> It was once besieged
by the Rebels under Colonel <HI>Horton,</HI> who
raised a Battery against it at the Foot of
a Hill near <HI>Newbury,</HI> by which he de∣molished
Three of the Towers, and a
part of the Wall. In Nineteen Days
Time there was above 1000 great Shot
spent ineffectually on the brave <HI>Loyalists,</HI>
who held out against the Menaces of
<HI>Manchester</HI>'s whole Army, in a Sally beat
the Rebels out of their Trenches, killed a
Lieutenant Colonel, and their chief En∣gineer,
and held out till they were re∣lieved
by the King, who, at <HI>Newbury,</HI>
honoured the couragious Governour with
Knighthood. After the Second <HI>Newbury</HI>
Fight, in..... it was again besieged,
having, during that Battle, under the
Protection of its Cannon, preserved the
Royal Ammunition and Baggage, but was
again relieved by the King, and the Rebel
General, <HI>Essex,</HI> was forced to raise the
Siege; a proceeding which lessened his
Interest with his Masters at <HI>Westminster,</HI>

the famous <HI>Chaucer</HI> himself, “One of
which was called the <HI>King</HI>'s, the other
the <HI>Queen</HI>'s, and a Third <HI>Chaucer</HI>'s
Oak. The first was Fifty Foot in

with a shady <HI>Tuft</HI> of Boughs, amongst
which, some were on each side curved
like <HI>Rams Horns,</HI> as if they had been so
industriously bent by Hand. This Oak
was of a Kind so excellent, cutting a
Grain clear as any <HI>Clap-board</HI> (as ap∣peared

<HEAD>NEWBURY Town.</HEAD>
<P>The Town of <HI>NEWBURY</HI> is situ∣ate
in the Hundred of <HI>Fair-Cross,</HI> is a Vi∣caridge
in the Gift of the Crown. It arose
out of the Ruins of <HI>Speen,</HI> and part of it,
near that Place, is called <HI>Spinham Land.</HI>
This was, long since, a Town of consi∣derable
Antiquity and Regard: At the
Conquest it was bestowed on <HI>Ernulph de
Hesain,</HI> to whose great Grandson it de∣scended,
who was killed at the Siege of
<HI>Lincoln;</HI> his Heir, the Bishop of <HI>Chalons,</HI>
sold it to <HI>William Marshall,</HI> Earl of <HI>Pem∣broke,</HI>
<PB N="289" REF="100"/>
who held it in his Family, till
<HI>Roger Bigod,</HI> Earl Marshal, for his Ob∣stinacy,
lost it in the Reign of King
<HI>Hen.</HI> III. This Town increasing in building
and Inhabitants, the Clothing Manu∣facture
met with so great Encourage∣ment,
that <HI>John Winchescombe,</HI> common∣ly
called <HI>Jack</HI> of <HI>Newbury,</HI> became in the
Reign of King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. the most emi∣nent
Clothier in <HI>England,</HI> in so much,
that he kept an Hundred Looms, and
well clothed, armed, and marched his
little Army of 100 to the Expedition at
<HI>Flodden Field.</HI> His House was visible here
in the last Century, but now divided into
several Tenements. This Place has been
Remarkable for nothing more, than ha∣ving
been the Scene of Action between
King <HI>Charles</HI> I. and the Rebel Parliament,
on 20 <HI>Septemb.</HI> 1643, and 27 <HI>Octob.</HI> 1644.
This Place is said, formerly, to have had
Representatives in Parliament, but peti∣tioned
to be discharged of that Expence,
which had they kept to these Days, they
had not only been excused their Salary, but
enriched their Town, as many others do
by Elections of this Nature. It had lost
most of its Clothing Trade, which the
Navigation of the River <HI>Kennet</HI> hither,
now begun, will probably recover. 'Tis
situated in a most fruitful Plain; the
<PB N="290" REF="101"/>
Streets are spacious, particularly the Mar∣ket-House,
over which is the <HI>Guild-Hall,</HI>
and where meet, for the Government of
the Town, the Mayor, High-Steward,
Recorder, Aldermen, and capital Bur∣gesses.
The Market is weekly, on <HI>Thurs∣day,</HI>
and is well stored with Corn, and
other Provisions, at a reasonable Rate. It
is noted for Trouts and Craw-fish, which
are preserved in Trunks, in running
Streams. Here are Three certain, and
Two uncertain Fairs, <HI>viz.</HI> 24 <HI>June,</HI>
24 <HI>Aug.</HI> 30 <HI>Novemb.</HI> the first Monday in

on the Borders of the <HI>Vale</HI> of <HI>White Horse,</HI>
at the Foot of the Downs, under <HI>Cuckam∣sley-Hill.</HI>
It is but a single Parish, though
situate in two different Hundreds, that
of <HI>Wantage</HI> and that of <HI>Reading;</HI> and in
it are five Manors, in all which is kept a
Court-Baron, and in three of them a
Court-Leet. So there belongs to this
Parish three Constables and three Tyth∣ing-men.</P>
<P>It was in the Possession of <HI>John</HI> Duke
of <HI>Bedford,</HI> Protector, and Regent of
<HI>France,</HI> who dying 14 <HI>Septemb.</HI> 1435, left
it to his Prince and Ward, <HI>Henry</HI> VI. who
bestowed it on the Priory of <HI>Carthusian</HI>
Monks of JESUS of <HI>Bethlem</HI> at <HI>Sheene</HI> in <HI>Surrey.</HI> It was bestowed upon that
Monastery by King <HI>Henry</HI> VI. who by
his Charter, bearing Date <HI>April</HI> 1. in the
3d Year of his Reign, granted to the Prior
and Monks of this Convent, for the Be∣nefit
of this their Manor of <HI>East Hendred.</HI>
It has a Weekly Market, upon <HI>Tuesday,</HI> and
two Fairs yearly, the one called St. <HI>Au∣gustin</HI>'s,
Fair, which began the 24th of
<HI>May,</HI> two Days before the Festival, and
lasted till the Day after; the other was
called St. <HI>Catherine</HI>'s Fair, and began the
<PB N="308" REF="119"/>
23d of <HI>November,</HI> and continued to the
26th, the Day after the Festival.</P>
<P>The same King <HI>Henry,</HI> by the same
Charter, exempts <HI>East Hendred</HI> from all
Taxes and Impositions, granted them the
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. e.</HI> A Power and Priviledge of judging Thieves taken within their Liberties.</NOTE> Liberty of <HI>Infangtheof</HI> and <HI>Outfangtheof,</HI>
and View of Frank Pledge of all their
Tenants and Residents, with a Pillory and
Tombrel, and Privilege to erect a Gal∣lows

<P>In this Manor, on the North East Side
of the Town, there stands an old Chapel
of Free-stone, supposed to have been built
by the Monks of <HI>Sheene,</HI> because it stands
in this Manor, and was about a hundred
Years ago called the Chapel of JESUS of
<HI>Bethlem.</HI> It is now called <HI>Champ</HI>'s <HI>Cha∣pel,</HI>
lying near, and belonging to one
Mr. <HI>Champ.</HI> The upper Part for these
many Years has been turned into a Pid∣geon-house,
and the lower into a Bake-house
and Washing-house.</P>
<P>In the North West Field of this Parish,
which is also in this Manor, there are se∣veral
Acres and half Acres of Ground, in∣termixed
with the Arable Land of that
<PB N="309" REF="120"/>
Field, which lye untilled, and to which no
Body lays any Claim. It is probable this
untilled Ground formerly belonged to some
Chaplain that officiated in this Chapel, and
that the People cared not to meddle with it,
for fear of the Imprecations laid upon the
Invaders of the Church Lands.</P>
<P>The Manor was probably heretofore
far more considerable than 'tis at present.
For in a Close, in the very Heart of the
Town, some old Foundations are found,
and Holes overgrown with Grass, suppo∣sed
by some to have formerly been Wells.
There are now about forty Customary
Tenants, which owe Suit and Service to
the Court here held; the greatest Part of
which are Copy-holders of Inheritance.
Of this Manor....... <HI>Whitwicke,</HI> Es{que}

<P>The second Manor is called the <HI>Abbey
Manor,</HI>

of the Abbey of <HI>Reading,</HI> having been gi∣ven
to that Monastery by <HI>Maude</HI> the Em∣press,

Es{que} who has born the Office of
High Sheriff of the County, and is at
present one of his Majesty's Justices of the
Peace. This Manor is in <HI>Wantage</HI> Hun∣dred,
and formerly belonged to the Ab∣bey
of <HI>Abington,</HI> if we are not misin∣formed.</P>
<P>The fourth Manor, called <HI>New College
Manor,</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Wantage,</HI> is
Part of the Possessions of <HI>New College</HI> in <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>The fifth and last Manor is called the
Manor of <HI>Arches.</HI> It belongs to <HI>Charles
Eyston,</HI> Es{que} afore-mentioned, and came
to him by one of his Ancestors marrying
the Daughter and Heiress of one <HI>William
de Arches.</HI> This is the only Manor of
the five that never belonged to the Church.
To Mr. <HI>Eyston</HI>'s Seat, which is the chief
Messuage, there is annexed an old Chapel,
called in some of his Writings the Chaun∣try
of St. <HI>Amand</HI> and St. <HI>John Buptst.</HI>
There formerly belonged to it a Parsonage
House, twelve Acres of Glebe, and the

<P>The greatest Curiosity in these Parts,
I find mentioned by Mr. <HI>John Lowthorp,</HI>
M. A. in his second Volume of the A∣bridgment
of the <HI>Philosophical Transacti∣ons,</HI>
<PB N="367" REF="178"/>
pag. 427, 428. communicated to the
<HI>Royal Society</HI> by Dr. <HI>James Brewer,</HI> and
abridged in the following Words. “Near
<HI>Reading,</HI> in <HI>Berkshire,</HI> for many suc∣ceeding
Generations, a continued Bo∣dy
of <HI>Oyster Shells</HI> has been found
through the whole Circumference of
5 or 6 Acres of Ground. The Foun∣dation
of these Shells is a hard rocky
Chalk, and above this Chalk the <HI>Oyster
Shells</HI> lye in Beds of green Sand, upon a
level, as nigh as can possibly be jud∣ged;
this <HI>Stratum</HI> of green Sand <HI>Oyster
Shells,</HI> is (as I measured) nigh two
Foot deep. Now, immediately above
this Layer, or <HI>Stratum</HI> of green Sand
and <HI>Shells,</HI> is a Bed of a bluish Sort of
Clay, very hard, brittle, and rugged;
they call it a pinny Clay, and is of no
Use. This Bed, or Layer of Clay, I
found to be nigh a Yard deep; and
immediately above it is a <HI>Stratum</HI> of
<HI>Fullers Earth,</HI> which is nigh two Foot
and a half deep; this <HI>Earth</HI> is often
made use of by our Clothiers: And a∣bove
this <HI>Earth</HI> is a Bed, or Layer, of
a clear, fine, white Sand, without the
least mixture of any <HI>Earth, Clay,</HI> &amp;c.
which is nigh seven Foot deep: Then
immediately above this is a stiff red
Clay, (which is the uppermost <HI>Stra∣tum</HI>)
<PB N="368" REF="179"/>
of which we make our Tiles.
The depth of this cannot be convenient∣ly
taken, it being so high a Hill, on the
top of which hath been, and is dug up,
a little common <HI>Earth,</HI> about two Foot
deep.”</P>
<P>“I have with a Mattock, dug out se∣veral
whole <HI>Oysters,</HI> with both their
<HI>Valves,</HI> or <HI>Shells</HI> lying together, as
<HI>Oysters,</HI> before opened: In their Cavity
there is got in some of the foremention∣ed
Sand. These Shells are so very brit∣tle,
that in digging for them, one of the
<HI>Valves</HI> will frequently drop from its
Fellow; but 'tis plainly to be seen that
they were united together, by placing
the Shell that drops off to its <HI>fellow
Valve,</HI> which exactly corresponds: But
I dug out several that were entire; nay,
some <HI>double Oysters</HI> with all their <HI>Valves</HI>
united.”</P>

was a College, and a Chantry for
one Warden, five Priests or Chaplains
(or if the Revenue would bear it, five
more were to be added, but ten never to
be exceeded) and two Clerks, founded
by Sir <HI>William Trussell,</HI> of <HI>Cublesdon,</HI> in
<HI>Staffordshire</HI> (not Sir <HI>John,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Ash∣mole,</HI>
says a little lower) Kt. in 1387.
which was dedicated to St. <HI>John Baptist,</HI>
and appropriated by Apostolical Bulls to
this Church. It was amply endowed,
but reduced very low by Fire, and other
Accidents, insomuch that it was deserted
by all but Mr. <HI>John Bradford,</HI> the War∣den.
Upon this King <HI>Edward</HI> III. gave
a Royal Licence to impropriate the
Church of <HI>Battlesden,</HI> in this County,
to it, which was actually done in 1380.
and other Benefactions were added to this:
It continued in a flourishing Condition

<HI>Paule Neile,</HI> Kt. and Grandchild to
<HI>Richard Neile,</HI> late Arch-Bishop of

in the County of <HI>Yorke,</HI> the
7th Day of <HI>December,</HI> 1637. and dyed

<P>Mr. <HI>Hearne,</HI> in his 120th Page of his
Account of some Antiquities between
<HI>Windsor</HI> and <HI>Oxford,</HI> added to the 5th Vol.
of <HI>Leland</HI>'s Itinerary, gives a fair Cha∣racter
of this <HI>religious</HI> and <HI>learned</HI> Gen∣tleman.
A small Distance Southward
from this Church, is a Seat called the
<HI>Hill House,</HI> which belonged formerly to the
Family of <HI>Windsors,</HI> and was called <HI>Wal∣tham
Place,</HI> but was mostly rebuilt about
1634. by Mr. <HI>Roger Gardiner,</HI> Gent. and
Citizen of <HI>London.</HI> Of the Bounds of this
Parish, a fuller Account cannot be given,
than has been already printed by the
aforesaid Mr. <HI>Hearne,</HI> in <HI>pag.</HI> 115, 116,
and 117. of his aforementioned Journey;
which being very rare, and but in few
Hands, I shall, begging bis Pardon, in∣sert
his own Words.</P>
<P>“After a good Number of <HI>Parishioners</HI>
have been call'd together by the toling
of the <HI>biggest Bell</HI> (which was also the
antient Custom of gathering the <HI>Parishi∣oners</HI>
together in all Parts of <HI>England</HI>
upon such <HI>solemn</HI> Occasions) they begin
their <HI>Perambulation</HI> in <HI>White Waltham
Street,</HI> at the End of the <HI>Smith</HI>'s <HI>Shop,</HI>
where there is a <HI>Ditch</HI> that is dug be∣tween
<PB N="499" REF="310"/>
<HI>Shottesbrooke</HI> and <HI>White Waltham,</HI>
Being directed by this <HI>Ditch</HI> they pass
on, and taking in Part of a large <HI>Field,</HI>
call'd <HI>Waltham Field,</HI> they enter into a
<HI>Close</HI> commonly known by the <HI>Name</HI> of
<HI>Terresh,</HI> which belong'd formerly to the
<HI>College</HI> of <HI>Shottesbrooke.</HI> Having taken
in Part of the said <HI>Close,</HI> they make a
<HI>Cross</HI> hard by <HI>Terresh Garden,</HI> where
were once <HI>great Buildings,</HI> as appear'd
by large Quantities of <HI>Ruins</HI> and <HI>Rubbish</HI>
(that seem'd to be very antient) when
'twas first plough'd up, which was done
within the memory of Man. Thence
they go into a <HI>Common Field</HI> call'd <HI>Wa∣tash</HI>
and take in most part of that from
<HI>Shottesbrooke.</HI> Afterwards they go in∣to
another <HI>Common Field</HI> call'd <HI>Westlowe,</HI>
and leaving the <HI>greatest part</HI> to <HI>Shottesbrooke,</HI>
they pass on by the <HI>Ditch-side,</HI>
and take in all the several <HI>Closes</HI> of Land
which belong'd lately to <HI>Richard Grove</HI>
of the <HI>Lane.</HI> Then they go into a <HI>Close</HI>
belonging to the <HI>Farm</HI> call'd <HI>Pidgeon
Holes,</HI> where there is a Room (at least
'tis reported to be) in the Parish of
<HI>White Waltham.</HI> After that they take
in a <HI>Close</HI> of about 20 <HI>Acres</HI> on the other
Side of the <HI>Lane,</HI> where some Years a∣go
there were <HI>Houses,</HI> and is known by
the Name of <HI>Eyllbudds.</HI> Then passing
<PB N="500" REF="311"/>
up the <HI>Lane</HI> to a <HI>Cross</HI> (in the Ground)
between <HI>Hurley</HI> and <HI>White Waltham,</HI>
they go on thence through several
<HI>Grounds</HI> between <HI>Hurley</HI> and <HI>White
Waltham,</HI> and take in a <HI>small Village</HI>
call'd <HI>Little Wick,</HI> where they cut a
<HI>Cross</HI> on one side of a large <HI>Beech Tree,</HI>
on the other side of which <HI>Tree</HI> the Pa∣rishioners
of <HI>Hurley</HI> cut another <HI>Cross,</HI>
Thence they go through an old <HI>Chalk
Pit</HI> to another great <HI>Beech Tree</HI> where
they like wise make a <HI>Cross</HI> close by the
<HI>High Road</HI> that leads to <HI>Reading.</HI> Then
they go along by the <HI>High Way</HI> side,
taking in part of it, to <HI>Woolley-Green,</HI>
where they make a <HI>Cross</HI> (in the Ground)
between <HI>Bisham, Cookham,</HI> and <HI>White
Waltham.</HI> Thence they go, turning
to the right Hand, to a <HI>Chalk Pit,</HI>
by which they make another <HI>Cross</HI> (in
the Ground) between <HI>Cookham, Bray</HI>
and <HI>White Waltham,</HI> and so they pass
through an <HI>Entry</HI> belonging to an anti∣ent
House call'd the <HI>White House,</HI> which
now belongs to <HI>Richard Bassett,</HI> and
some Years ago was part of the <HI>Possessions</HI>
of the old Family of the <HI>Westcotts;</HI>
Leaving one End of the said House to
<HI>Bray</HI> after they have taken a <HI>Refresh∣ment</HI>
here, (as the Parishioners of <HI>Bray</HI>
likewise use to do) they go thence along
<PB N="501" REF="312"/>
by the <HI>Ditch</HI> side through several <HI>Grounds</HI>
between <HI>Bray</HI> and <HI>White Waltham,</HI> 'till
they come to the <HI>Lane House,</HI> where
they take another <HI>Refreshment.</HI> Then
they pass on to a <HI>Close</HI> belonging to <HI>Lan∣toons
Farm.</HI> At this <HI>Farm</HI> they stop and
take another <HI>Refreshment,</HI> and so going
thwart <HI>Low Brook Lane</HI> they enter one
of <HI>Heywood</HI> Grounds call'd <HI>Walnut Tree
Plot.</HI> Being enter'd that <HI>Close</HI> they pass
on <HI>Southwards</HI> all along the <HI>Grounds</HI> be∣longing
to <HI>Heywood,</HI> 'till they come to
the <HI>Mote</HI> by <HI>Heywood</HI> House, at which
<HI>House</HI> they put in and use to have a <HI>no∣ble
Treat.</HI> Then going through the o∣ther
<HI>Grounds</HI> belonging to the said <HI>House</HI>
between <HI>Bray</HI> and <HI>White Waltham,</HI> they
pass into a <HI>Wood</HI> or <HI>Coppice</HI> call'd <HI>White
Paddock,</HI> and so keep on <HI>Southward</HI>
near <HI>Payley Street,</HI> where at a House
call'd <HI>Triggs</HI> they have a <HI>Refreshment.</HI>
Then they return and keep on <HI>South∣ward</HI>'
till they come into the Common
<HI>High Way</HI> leading to <HI>Windsor, and there
upon an Elm Tree they makes a Cross be∣tween
Bray and White Waltham.</HI>
Thence they turn <HI>Westward</HI> down the
said <HI>High Way</HI> 'till they come to <HI>Shipcott
Lane.</HI> Here they steer <HI>Southward</HI> and
pass up the said <HI>Lane,</HI> leaving <HI>Waltham
Hills</HI> on the left Hand in <HI>Bray</HI> Parish,
<PB N="502" REF="313"/>
'till they come to a <HI>Cross</HI> which is cut
in the Ground at the said <HI>Lanes</HI> End,
and divides <HI>Bray</HI> from <HI>White Waltham.</HI>
Then they turn <HI>Eastward,</HI> and taking
in a small <HI>Cottage</HI> with an <HI>Orchard,</HI> they
pass on to <HI>Tutchin Lane</HI> End, where they
make a <HI>Cross</HI> on an <HI>Elm Tree,</HI> which
<HI>Tree</HI> was planted by Sir <HI>Edmund Sawyer,</HI>
Kt. About Threescore Years ago, before
which Time there stood in the same
<HI>Place</HI> a prodigious great hollow <HI>Oak</HI>
call'd <HI>Fair Oak.</HI> Then they turn <HI>South∣ward</HI>
and pass on by <HI>Bray Wood</HI> side 'till
they come near the great <HI>Pond,</HI> where
is a very large <HI>Stone</HI> (that is fix'd deep
in the Ground) call'd <HI>Red Stone.</HI> Lea∣ving
this <HI>Stone,</HI> which is a <HI>Bound</HI> or
<HI>Mark</HI> between <HI>Bray</HI> and <HI>White Wal∣tham,</HI>
they turn <HI>Westward,</HI> and taking
in a small <HI>Cottage</HI> and <HI>Back-side,</HI> they car∣ry
on their <HI>Journey</HI> by the <HI>Hedge-side</HI> 'till
they come quite to the bottom of <HI>Jealous
Hill,</HI> where they make a <HI>Cross</HI> (in the
Ground) between <HI>Bray</HI> and <HI>White Wal∣tham.</HI>
Then they ascend the said <HI>Hill,</HI>
and passing on it <HI>South East,</HI> 'till they are
got about half way, they make another
<HI>Cross</HI> (in the Ground) between <HI>Warfield</HI>
and <HI>White Waltham.</HI> Then they turn
<HI>Westward</HI> by a <HI>crooked Gutter</HI> side near
<HI>Hazell Wood,</HI> and go on 'till they come
<PB N="503" REF="314"/>
near <HI>Westlowe Mills.</HI> Here they turn
<HI>Northward,</HI> and travel on to the Cor∣ner
of a <HI>Wood,</HI> where there formerly
stood a <HI>Maple Tree.</HI> At this <HI>Place</HI> they
makes a <HI>Cross</HI> (in the Ground) between
<HI>Binfield</HI> and <HI>White Waltham,</HI> keeping
on <HI>Northward</HI> by the <HI>Ditch</HI> side near
<HI>Cockshott</HI> Bridge, they pass through a
<HI>Wood</HI> call'd <HI>Halwicke's Wood,</HI> 'till they
come near <HI>Brick</HI> Bridge. Then they
turn <HI>Westward,</HI> and taking in a small
<HI>Wood</HI> or <HI>Coppice,</HI> that was taken out of
the <HI>Common,</HI> they pass on 'till they come
into <HI>Beenham's</HI> Heath, where they go
near an old <HI>Ditch,</HI> or rather a <HI>Bulwark,</HI>
and do not stop 'till they come near
<HI>Beenham's,</HI> where there was formerly
a <HI>Church,</HI> as it appears from the old
<HI>Valor Beneficiorum,</HI> tho' it has been de∣stroy'd
several Years. Here they make
a great <HI>Cross</HI> in the Ground as a <HI>Boun∣dary</HI>
between them and <HI>Laurence Wal∣tham.</HI>
Thence they turn <HI>Northward</HI>
through the midst of a <HI>Wood,</HI> and Com∣ing
near <HI>Pundall's Farm,</HI> they turn <HI>East∣ward</HI>
into <HI>Smewin's</HI> Grounds, and take
a <HI>Refreshment</HI> at <HI>Smewin's</HI> House, a <HI>Place</HI>
that is moted round, and was formerly
(as 'tis reported) one of the <HI>Country
Houses</HI> of Prince <HI>Arthur,</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI>
the Seventh's eldest Son. Here without
<PB N="504" REF="315"/>
the <HI>Gate</HI> is a <HI>Cross</HI> (in the <HI>Common</HI>) be∣tween
<HI>White Waltham</HI> and <HI>Shottesbrooke.</HI>
Then they turn again, and taking in
most part <HI>of Smewin's</HI> Grounds, they
carry on their <HI>Journey</HI> 'till they come in∣to
<HI>Shottesbrooke</HI> Marsh, where they end
their <HI>Perambulation.</HI>”</P>
<P>“Altho' during the Time <HI>Dr. Carswell</HI>
was Vicar of <HI>Bray,</HI> the <HI>Incroachments</HI> up∣on
the Parish of <HI>White Waltham</HI> were
more consderable and grievous than they
had ever been before, yet the <HI>Differen∣ces</HI>
between each Parish upon account
of the <HI>true Bounds</HI> had been carry'd ve∣ry
high in former Times, particularly in
the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the First,
when the <HI>Matter</HI> was strictly examin'd
by proper Persons delegated and sworn
for that purpose, and the Issue of the <HI>In∣quiry</HI>
was recorded, and is now extant
amongst other old <HI>Evidences</HI> in the
Tower of <HI>London.</HI> It appears from
thence that this <HI>Controversy</HI> was decided
in the Year MCCCXL. being the 14th
Year of that King's Reign; and that one
Cause of the <HI>Inquiry</HI> was the King's <HI>Se∣questration of some</HI> of the <HI>Tithes</HI> that be∣long'd
to the Parish of <HI>Bray.</HI> One of the
Persons impanell'd upon the <HI>Jury</HI> was
<HI>Edmund de Littlefend,</HI> which perhaps
should be <HI>Edmund de Littlefield, fend</HI> for
<PB N="505" REF="316"/>
<HI>field</HI> being often us'd in <HI>old Records</HI>
There is a Place call'd <HI>Littlefield,</HI> a <HI>Green</HI>
in which are some <HI>Houses,</HI> situated near
a Mile <HI>Southwards</HI> from the Church of
<HI>White Waltham,</HI> from which 'tis not un∣likely
the <HI>Family</HI> might be denominated.
The <HI>Jury</HI> gave in Evidence, That the
Parish of <HI>Bray</HI> began at a Place call'd
<HI>Bodelespole,</HI> which is the same that is
now nam'd <HI>Ruddlespole.</HI> From thence
it extended it self to the House of <HI>Wal∣ter
de la Hawe,</HI> in the Parish of <HI>Wind∣sor,</HI>
and from thence to a Place call'd in
the <HI>Instrument</HI> by the Name of <HI>Elyster,</HI>
which was the farthest Limit South∣wards.
From thence it stretched it self
to <HI>Hethrewe,</HI> which was the <HI>Bound</HI>
Westward. Then it went to a Place
(near <HI>Bradenbrugg</HI>) where in <HI>old Time</HI>
stood a certain <HI>Oak.</HI> This was One of
the <HI>Limits</HI> of <HI>Bounds,</HI> and on it they
us'd to cut a <HI>Cross,</HI> Thence it extended
it self to <HI>Crukessend,</HI> one of the King's
<HI>Vacheryes;</HI> from <HI>Crukesfend</HI> to <HI>Fayrhok,</HI>
from <HI>Fayrhok</HI> to <HI>Wolvelye,</HI> and from
<HI>Wolvelye</HI> to <HI>Maydenhith,</HI> or <HI>Maidenhead,</HI>
In this <HI>Paper</HI> there is nothing that re∣lates
to the <HI>Bounds</HI> of <HI>White Waltham</HI>
but <HI>Crukessend, Fayrhok</HI> and <HI>Wolvelye.</HI>
The first I take to be the same House
where Mr. <HI>Hercy</HI> now d welleth at <HI>Haw∣thorne,</HI>
<PB N="506" REF="317"/>
some distance <HI>Southward</HI> from
<HI>Red Stone Pond;</HI> in confirmation of
which Opinion Mr. <HI>Hercy</HI> lately told a
certain <HI>Friend</HI> of mine, that it was for∣merly,
as appear'd by his <HI>Writings,</HI>
one of the King's <HI>Dary Houses.</HI> From
this <HI>old Inquisition</HI> there is some room
to conjecture that the Parishioners of
<HI>White Waltham</HI> ought to go in their
<HI>Perambulations</HI> as far as this House, and
perhaps they had formerly a <HI>Refresh∣ment</HI>
at it. <HI>Fayrhok</HI> is nothing but the
<HI>great Oak</HI> I have mention'd in the former
<HI>Section:</HI> and <HI>Wolvelye</HI> is what we now
call <HI>Wooley.</HI> The <HI>Saxons</HI> call'd this last
Place <HI>Pulverleag,</HI> i. e. <HI>A Place of Wolves.</HI>
'Tis not at all improbable that 'twas for∣merly
much infested with <HI>Wolves,</HI> espe∣cially
if it be confider'd that the <HI>Woods</HI>
were here, as well as in all those <HI>Chil∣tern</HI>
Parts, far thicker and larger than they
are at present, and were a <HI>Refuge</HI> for
<HI>Robbers</HI> (as well as for <HI>wild Beasts;</HI>)
which was the reason that the Manor of
<HI>Flamstede</HI> was given by <HI>Leofstan,</HI> Abbot
of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> to a certain Souldier of
great <HI>Valor</HI> and <HI>Courage</HI> call'd <HI>Tburnoth,</HI>
with this Condition, That he should in
lieu of it take effectual Methods to have
most of the <HI>Woods</HI> cut down, and the
<HI>Robbers</HI> dispers'd, which accordingly
<PB N="507" REF="318"/>
he carefully and punctually perform'd.
This is related in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to Dr.
<HI>Watt's</HI> Accurate Edition of <HI>Matthew
Paris;</HI> but I do not remember to have
met with it in any other publish'd Au∣thor.
Now as <HI>Crukessend</HI> was a Bound
to <HI>Bray,</HI> so 'tis likely that it deriv'd its
Name from the <HI>large Cross</HI> that was here
cut formerly to distinguish and mark
out the <HI>Limits</HI> of the <HI>Parish.</HI> Of late
Years the <HI>Parishioners</HI> have <HI>strangely</HI> in∣truded
upon <HI>White Waltham</HI> in the <HI>Com∣mon,</HI>
and have taken in a great Part of
<HI>Heywood Lordship,</HI> quite contrary to the
<HI>Determination</HI> in the <HI>Paper</HI> I have pro∣duc'd,
and altogether against <HI>Custom.</HI> I
remember that some Years ago I had the
curiosity to walk round the Parish of
<HI>White Waltham</HI> my self in one of the
<HI>Yearly Circuits,</HI> at which time I could
not but take particular Notice of the In∣solence
of the Parishioners of <HI>Bray</HI> in
transgressing their <HI>Bounds,</HI> when they
came to <HI>Crukessend.</HI> Dr. <HI>Carswell</HI> head∣ed
and directed them, and they pass'd
in <HI>great Triumph</HI> through the <HI>Common,</HI>
taking in all <HI>Red Stone Pond,</HI> and con∣siderably
farther more <HI>West;</HI> whereas
they ought to have left the <HI>Pond</HI> on the
<HI>West,</HI> and to have kept close by the
<HI>Wood</HI> Side. I take the <HI>Red Stone</HI> to
<PB N="508" REF="319"/>
have been plac'd at that Time when the
<HI>Controversy</HI> first began. We meet with
some <HI>Stones</HI> in <HI>England</HI> that were fix'd
purely to notify the exact Bounds of
<HI>Counties;</HI> and this <HI>Stone</HI> we are speaking
of was look'd upon as a more standing,
and sure <HI>Mark</HI> for Distinction, than a
<HI>Cross</HI> on a <HI>Tree</HI> or in the <HI>Ground,</HI> and
less subject to <HI>Alteration,</HI> and the adjoyn∣ing
<HI>Pond</HI> taking its Name from it,
would also serve as a Direction to <HI>Po∣sterity</HI>
in settling the <HI>Disputes</HI> that might
arise upon this Occasion.”</P>

<P>And for the Performance of these premi∣ses,

are already married (if they be Daugh∣ters)
or are Four and Twenty Years of
Age, to be paid them at the end of one
Year after my decease. And the Shares
of the rest, when they shall be Four and

as aforesaid (I mean, those that be
yet under that Age, and unmarried) then
my will is, That the share and part of
such as shall so die, shall accrue and be
paid unto the rest of the same Children
then surviving, share and share like, and

Newman,</HI> Son of my said Sister, shall
not have any Part or Share of this said
Legacy of Two Thousand Marks, because
I give him a large Legacy apart by this
my will; therefore the said Two Thou∣sand
Marks is to be divided and shared
among the rest of the Children of my said
Sister, as aforesaid.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> I do hereby absolutely acquit and
forgive my Brother-in-Law, Husband to

Parts of such respectively, shall be paid

Mr. <HI>Griffin Higgs,</HI> at first Fellow of

Sir <HI>Thomas White's</HI> Life (who died 11

Account of his extensive Liberali∣ty,
is best given in <HI>Mr.</HI> John Stow's <HI>Sur∣vey
of</HI> London, printed at <HI>London,</HI> 1633.
<HI>Folio,</HI> in <HI>Page</HI> 91, 92. in the following
Words, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>“Sir <HI>Thomas White,</HI> Lord Mayor of
this honourable City, in <HI>Anno</HI> 1554.
and a worthy Brother likewise of the
Merchant-Taylor's Society, being a
lover of Learning, and an earnest fur∣therer
thereof, first purchased the Hall
<PB N="549" REF="360"/>
in <HI>Oxenford,</HI> called <HI>Glocester-Hall,</HI> for
Scholars and Students, to receive there
the benefit of Learning. But his pri∣vate
Thoughts very often soliciting him,
that he should (in Time) meet with a
Place where two Elms grew, and that
there his further Purpose should take
effect. At length he found out the
Place, where (at his own Cost and Ex∣pence)
he founded the famous College,
called Saint <HI>John Baptist</HI> College, and
where these two Elms (as I have heard)
are yet standing, endowing it with such
liberal Gifts, Lands and Revenues, as
would require too much Time here to
be remembred or set down.”</P>
<P>“Beside his Provision for Learning in
this worthy Place, he erected other
Schools; as at <HI>Bristow, Reading,</HI> and
a College at <HI>Higham</HI> Ferries. More, he
gave to the City of <HI>Bristol,</HI> the Sum of
Two Thousand Pounds to purchase
Land, amounting to the yearly Value
of an Hundred and Twenty Pound.
The Mayor and Citizens paying there∣fore
yearly an Hundred Pounds, Eight
Hundred Pounds must be lent to sixteen
poor Clothiers, Fifty Pounds each Man,
for the space of Ten Years, sufficient
Security being given by them for the
same. Afterwards that Eight Hundred
<PB N="550" REF="361"/>
Pounds was to pass to other sixteen
poor Clothiers, according to the discre∣tion
of them put in trust. Two Hun∣dred
Pounds beside was reserved for
provision of Corn, and needful Occasi∣ons
for the Poor, in the Order and Care
of the Mayor, Aldermen and Citizens,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI>”</P>
<P>“Then according to his Will, which
remaineth yet to be seen, out of this
bountiful Gift to <HI>Bristol,</HI> these memo∣rable
Branches, and Benevolences, were
(by himself) devised, and thus ordered,
beginning in the Year 1577. and so
thence forward they went on according
to his own direction. Then on the Feast
of Saint <HI>Bartholomew</HI> was brought to
the Merchant-Taylor's Hall an Hun∣dred
and Four Pounds; the Hundred
Pounds to be lent (for ten Years space)
to Four poor young Men in the City of
<HI>York,</HI> Freemen, and Inhabitants, being
Clothiers; and the Four Pounds over∣plus,
to be employed about the Charges
and Pains, that no Man (used in the
Business) might receive discontentment.
Then in 1578. the like Sum was to be
delivered thence to <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and so
thence forward, the same Sums (year∣ly)
to the Cities and Towns following
orderly.”</P>

<P>“This Sum of One Hundred and Four
Pounds, passing thus yearly to the fore∣named
Places, is delivered still at the
Merchant-Taylor-Hall, and to the good
intended Uses of the giver; and that
there might be no breathing while for
so just a Steward's Talent, but to have
it still kept in continual Employment
<PB N="552" REF="363"/>
for the Poor, the same Order was ap∣pointed,
to take beginning again (as
before) at the City of <HI>York,</HI> and so suc∣cessively
(while the World endureth) to
the Towns beforenamed, in the self
same Course as it had the Original, with
great care and observance in them, to
whom it belongeth, that the dead may
not be abused, nor poor Men's Right in∣jured.”</P>
<P>“But did he thus shut up his Purse, and
say to himself, I have given sufficient?
No, he did cast his pitying Eye next on
the City of <HI>Coventry,</HI> distressed (at that
Time) in great and greivous manner.
What his instant Benevolence was, he
took it to be but as an Hours Sun-shine
after a whole Day of Storm and Tem∣pest,
although it might yeild some
Comfort, were the Season never so
short. But to establish a Certainty,
that no dismay or doubt should ever af∣ter
be able to remove (even as a worthy
Pyramide erected to perpetuity) he gave
to the City of <HI>Coventry</HI> 1400 Pounds,
therewith to purchase Lands rising to
the annual Value of Seventy Pounds.
Twelve aged poor Inhabitants of that
City were to have (in free Alms) Twen∣ty
Four Pounds, each Man Forty Shil∣lings
yearly, on the eleventh Day of
<PB N="553" REF="364"/>
<HI>March,</HI> or within six Days after. Four
poor young Men also were to have
Forty Pounds lent them in free Loan,
Ten Pound each Man, and for Nine
Years space, upon sufficient Security gi∣ven.
And their Turns being thus ser∣ved,
then Four other poor young Men
were to have the like Sums, and for
like Limitation, and so from Nine Years
to Nine Years for ever.”</P>
<P>“Afterwards it was ordered (in free
Loan) to Two poor Men of the same
City; and lastly, to One, in which Na∣ture
(according to the several Limitati∣ons)
it doth yet, and doubtless shall for
ever continue. Also the same Sum was
appointed to One young Man in <HI>Nor∣thampton,</HI>
for Nine Years, in free Loan.
Next, to One in the City of <HI>Leicester.</HI>
Thirdly, to One in <HI>Nottingham.</HI> Fourth∣ly,
to One in <HI>Warwick,</HI> and for the like
Time. Then returning again to <HI>Coven∣try,</HI>
for one Year, it repasseth to the said
Towns again, each after other in like Na∣ture,
for ever. And lest his worthy Intent
should fail in the continuance, he enlar∣ged
his first Gift to <HI>Coventry</HI> of Fourteen
Hundred Pounds, to Two Thousand,
and Sixty Pounds to be employed, as hath
been remembred; Forty Pounds being
yearly paid out of it to Saint <HI>John Bap∣tist</HI>
<PB N="554" REF="365"/>
College in <HI>Oxenford,</HI> and Allowances
also by himself given in each Place, that
Bonds should be made without any
Charge to the Receiver.”</P>
<P>A full Account of this Charity, and to
what ill Uses it had been put, and how
perverted, we had Reasons to expect from
a Person who was engaged in a History
of the Antiquities of the City of <HI>Coventry,</HI>
to which he promised to add a Copy of the
original Instrument for settling and regu∣lating
the Distribution of this most bene∣ficial
Charity, but the Work, I believe,
incompleat, died with its Author.</P>
