<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A few kind Offices.</HEAD>
<P>WITH deep concern Edgar revolved in his mind
the suggestions of Dr. Marchmont; and meditation,
far from diminishing, added importance to the
arguments of his friend. To obtain the hand of an
object he so highly admired, though but lately his
sole wish, appeared now an uncertain blessing, a sus∣picious
good, since the possession of her heart was no
longer to be considered as its inseparable appendage.
His very security of the approbation of Mr. and
Mrs. Tyrold became a source of solicitude; and,
secret from them, from her, and from all, he deter∣mined
to guard his views▪ till he could find some op∣portunity
of investigating her own unbiassed senti∣ments.</P>
<P>Such were his ruminations, when, on re-entering
the Park, he perceived her wandering alone amidst
the trees. Her figure looked so interesting, her air
so serious, her solitude so attractive, that every
maxim of tardy prudence, every caution of timid
foresight, would instantly have given way to the
quick feelings of generous impulse, had he not been
restrained by his promise to Dr. Marchmont. He
dismounted, and giving his horse to his groom, re∣traced
her footsteps.</P>
<P>Camilla, almost without her own knowledge, had
strolled towards the gate, whence she concluded Ed∣gar
to have ridden from the Park, and, almost with∣out
consciousness, had continued sauntering in its
vicinity; yet she no sooner descried him, than,
struck with a species of self-accusation for this ap∣pearance
of awaiting him, she crossed over to the
<PB N="194" REF="3"/>
nearest path towards the house, and, for the first
time, was aware of the approach of Edgar without
hastening to meet him.</P>
<P>He slackened his pace, to quiet his spirits, and
restore his manner to its customary serenity, before
he permitted himself to overtake her. “Can you,”
he then cried, “forgive me, when you hear I have
been fulfilling my own appointment, and have post∣poned
my promised investigation?”</P>
<P>“Rather say,” she gently answered, “could I
have forgiven you, if you had shewn me you thought
my impatience too ungovernable for any delay?”</P>
<P>To find her thus willing to oblige him, was a new
delight, and he expressed his acknowledgments in
terms the most flattering.</P>
<P>An unusual seriousness made her hear him almost
without reply; yet peace and harmony revisited her
mind, and, in listening to his valued praise, she for∣got
her late alarm at her own sensations, and without
extending a thought beyond the present instant, again
felt tranquil and happy: while to Edgar she ap∣peared
so completely all that was adorable, that he
could only remember to repent his engagement with
Dr. Marchmont.</P>
<P>Her secret opinion that he was dissatisfied with
his lot, gave a softness to her accents that enchanted
him; while the high esteem for his character, which
mingled with her pity, joined to a lowered sense of
her own, from a new-born terror lest that pity were
too tender, spread a charm wholly new over her na∣tive
fire and vivacity.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, they were overtaken by Man∣dlebert's
gardener, who was bringing from Beech
Park a basket of flowers for his master. They were
selected from curious hot-house plants, and Camilla
stopt to admire their beauty and fragrance.</P>
<P>Edgar presented her the basket; whence she sim∣ply
took a sprig of myrtle and geranium, conceiving
the present to be designed for Indiana. “If you
are fond of geraniums,” said he, “there is an almost
<PB N="195" REF="4"/>
endless variety in my green-house, and I will bring
you to-morrow some specimens.”</P>
<P>She thanked him, and while he gave orders to the
gardener, Miss Margland and Indiana advanced from
the house.</P>
<P>Miss Margland had seen them from her window,
where, in vain deliberation, she had been considering
what step to take. But, upon beholding them to∣gether,
she thought deliberation and patience were
hopeless, and determined, by a decisive stroke, to
break in its bud the connection she supposed forming,
or throw upon Camilla all censure, if she failed, as
the sole means she could devise to exculpate her own
fagacity from impeachment. She called upon In∣diana,
therefore, to accompany her into the Park,
exclaiming, in an angry tone, “Miss Lynmere, I
will shew you the true cause why Mr. Mandlebert
does not declare himself—your cousin, Miss Camilla,
is wheedling him away from you.”</P>
<P>Indiana, whose belief in almost whatever was said,
was undisturbed by any species of reflection, felt
filled with resentment, and a sense of injury, and
readily following, said—“I was sure there was some∣thing
more in it than I saw, because Mr. Melmond
behaved so differently. But I don't take it very kind
of my cousin, I can tell her!”</P>
<P>They then hurried into the Park; but, as they
came without any plan, they were no sooner within
a few yards of the meeting, than they stopt short, at
a loss what to say or do.</P>
<P>Edgar, vexed at their interruption, continued
talking to the gardener, to avoid joining them; but
seeing Camilla, who less than ever wished for their
communications, walk instantly another way, he
thought it would be improper to pursue her, and
only bowing to Miss Margland and Indiana, went
into the house.</P>
<P>“This is worse than ever,” cried Miss Margland,
“to stalk off without speaking, or even offering you
any of his flowers, which, I dare say, are only to be
put into the parlour flower-pots, for the whole house.”</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="5"/>
“I'm sure I'm very glad of it,” said Indiana, “for
I hate flowers; but I'm sure Mr. Melmond would
not have done so; nor Colonel Andover; nor Mr.
Macdersey more than all.”</P>
<P>“No, nor any body else, my dear, that had com∣mon
sense, and their eyes open; nor Mr. Mandlebert
neither, if it were not for Miss Camilla. However,
we'll let her know we see what she is about; and let
Sir Hugh know too: for as to the colonels, and the
ensigns, and that young Oxford student, they won't
at all do; officers are commonly worth nothing; and
scholars, you may take my word for it, my dear,
are the dullest men in the world. Besides, one would
not give up such a fine fortune as Mr. Mandlebert's
without making a little struggle for it. You don't
know how many pretty things you may do with it.
So let us shew her we don't want for spirit, and
speak to her at once.”</P>
<P>These words, reviving in the mind of Indiana
her wedding clothes, the train of servants, and the
new equipage, gave fresh pique to her provocation:
but finding some difficulty to overtake the fleet Ca∣milla,
whose pace kept measure with her wish to
avoid them, she called after her, to desire she would
not walk so fast.</P>
<P>Camilla reluctantly loitered, but without stopping
or turning to meet them, that she might still regale
herself with the perfume of the geranium presented
her by Edgar.</P>
<P>“You're in great haste, ma'am,” said Miss Mar∣gland,
“which I own I did not observe to be the
case just now!”</P>
<P>Camilla, in much surprise, asked, what she meant.</P>
<P>“My meaning is pretty plain, I believe, to any
body that chose to understand it. However, though
Miss Lynmere scorns to be her own champion, I can∣not,
as a friend, be quite so passive, nor help hinting
to you, how little you would like such a proceeding
to yourself, from any other person.”</P>
<P>“What proceeding?” cried Camilla, blushing,
from a dawning comprehension of the subject, though
resenting the manner of the complaint.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="6"/>
“Nay, only ask yourself, ma'am, only ask your∣self,
Miss Camilla, how you should like to be so sup∣planted,
if such an establishment were forming for
yourself, and every thing were fixt, and every body
else refused, and nobody to hinder its all taking place,
but a near relation of your own, who ought to be
the first to help it forward. I should like to know,
I say, Miss Camilla, how you would feel, if it were
your own case?”</P>
<P>Astonished and indignant at so sudden and violent
an assault, Camilla stood suspended, whether to deign
any vindication, or to walk silently away: yet its
implications involuntarily filled with a thousand other,
and less offending emotions than those of anger, and
a general confusion crimsoned her cheeks.</P>
<P>“You cannot but be sensible, ma'am,” resumed
Miss Margland, “for sense is not what you want,
that you have seduced Mr. Mandlebert from your
cousin; you cannot but see he takes hardly the
smallest notice of her, from the pains you are at to
make him admire nobody but yourself.”</P>
<P>The spirit of Camilla now rose high to her aid, at
a charge thus impertinent and unjust. “Miss Mar∣gland,”
she cried, “you shock and amaze me! I am
at a loss for any motive to so cruel an accusation:
but you, I hope at least, my dear Indiana, are con∣vinced
how much it injures me.” She would then
have taken the hand of Indiana, but disdainfully
drawing it back, “I shan't break my heart about it,
I assure you,” she cried, “you are vastly welcome to
him for me; I hope I am not quite so odious, but I
may find other people in the world besides Mr. Man∣dlebert!”</P>
<P>“O, as to that,” said Miss Margland, “I am
sure you have only to look in order to chuse; but
since this affair has been settled by your uncle, I can't
say I think it very grateful in any person to try to
overset his particular wishes. Poor old gentleman!
I'm sure I pity him! It will go hard enough with
him, when he comes to hear it! Such a requital!—
and from his own niece!”</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="7"/>
This was an attack the most offensive that Camilla
could receive; nothing could so nearly touch her as
an idea of ingratitude to her uncle, and resting upon
that, the whole tide of those feelings which were, in
fact, divided and subdivided into many crossing chan∣nels,
she broke forth, with great eagerness, into ex∣claiming,
Miss Margland, this is quite barbarous!
You know, and you, Indiana, cannot but know, I
would not give my uncle the smallest pain, to be
mistress of a thousand universes!”</P>
<P>“Why, then,” said Miss Margland, “should you
break up a scheme which he has so much set his heart
upon? Why are you always winning over Mr. Man∣dlebert
to yourself, by all that flattery? Why are
you always consulting him? always obliging him?
always of his opinion? always ready to take his ad∣vice?”</P>
<P>“Miss Margland,” replied Camilla, with the ex∣tremest
agitation, “this is so unexpected—so unde∣served
an interpretation—my consultation, or my ac∣quiescence,
have been merely from respect; no other
thought, no other motive—Good God! what is it you
imagine?—what guilt would you impute to me?”</P>
<P>“O dear,” cried Indiana, “pray don't suppose
it signifies. If you like to make compliments in
that manner to gentlemen, pray do it. I hope I
shall always hold myself above it. I think it's their
place to make compliments to me.”</P>
<P>A resentful answer was rising to the tongue of
Camilla, when she perceived her two little sprigs,
which in her recent disorder she had dropt, were de∣molishing
under the feet of Indiana, who, with ap∣parent
unmeaningness, but internal suspicion of their
giver, had trampled upon them both. Hastily stoop∣ing
she picked them up, and, with evident vexation,
was blowing from them the dust and dirt, when In∣diana
scoffingly said, “I wonder where you got
that geranium?”</P>
<P>“I don't wonder at all,” said Miss Margland,
“for Sir Hugh has none of that species; so one
may easily guess.”</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="8"/>
Camilla felt herself blush, and letting the flowers
fall, turned to Indiana, and said, “Cousin, if on
my account, it is possible you can suffer the smallest
uneasiness, tell me but what I shall do—you shall
dictate to me—you shall command me.”</P>
<P>Indiana disclaimed all interest in her behaviour;
but Miss Margland cried, “What you can do,
ma'am, is this, and nothing can be easier, nor fairer:
leave off paying all that court to Mr Mandlebert, of
asking his advice, and follow your own way, whether
he likes it or not, and go to see Mrs. Arlbery, and
Mrs. every body else, when you have a mind, without
waiting for his permission, or troubling yourself about
what he thinks of it.”</P>
<P>Camilla now trembled in every joint, and with
difficulty restrained from tears, while, timidly, she
said—“And do you, my dear Indiana, demand of
me this conduct? and will it, at least, satisfy you?”</P>
<P>“Me? O dear no! I demand nothing, I assure
you. The whole matter is quite indifferent to me,
and you may ask his leave for every thing in the
world, if you chuse it. There are people enough
ready to take my part, I hope, if you set him against
me ever so much.”</P>
<P>“Indeed, indeed, Indiana,” said Camilla, over∣powered
with conflicting sensations, “this is using
me very unkindly!” And, without waiting to hear
another word, she hurried into the house, and flew
to hide herself in her own room.</P>
<P>This was the first bitter moment she had ever
known. Peace, gay though uniform, had been the
constant inmate of her breast, enjoyed without
thought, possessed without struggle; not the sub∣dued
gift of accommodating philosophy, but the in∣born
and genial produce of youthful felicity's best
aliment, the energy of its own animal spirits.</P>
<P>She had, indeed, for some time past, thought
Edgar of too refined and too susceptible a character
for the unthinking and undistinguishing Indiana;
and for the last day or two, her regret at his fate had
strengthened itself into an averseness of his supposed
<PB N="200" REF="9"/>
destination, that made the idea of it painful, and the
subject repugnant to her; but she had never, till this
very morning, distrusted the innoxiousness either of
her pity or her regard; and, startled at the first sur∣mise
of danger, she had wished to fly even from her∣self,
rather than venture to investigate feelings so un∣welcome;
yet still and invariably, she had concluded
Edgar the future husband of Indiana.</P>
<P>To hear there were any doubts of the intended
marriage, filled her with emotions indefinable; to
hear herself named as the cause of those doubts, was
alarming both to her integrity and her delicacy. She
felt the extremest anger at the unprovoked and un∣warrantable
harshness of Miss Margland, and a re∣sentment
nearly equal at the determined petulance,
and unjustifiable aspersions of Indiana.</P>
<P>Satisfied of the innocence of her intentions, she
knew not what alteration she could make in her be∣haviour;
and, after various plans, concluded, that to
make none would best manifest her freedom from self∣reproach.
At the summons therefore to dinner, she
was the first to appear, eager to show herself un∣moved
by the injustice of her accusers, and desirous
to convince them she was fearless of examination.</P>
<P>Yet, too much discomposed to talk in her usual
manner, she seized upon a book till the party was
seated. Answering then to the call of her uncle,
with as easy an air as she could assume, she took her
accustomed place by his side, and began, for mere
employment, filling a plate from the dish that was
nearest to her; which she gave to the footman, with∣out
any direction whither to carry, or enquiry if any
body chose to eat of it.</P>
<P>It was taken round the table, and, though refused
by all, she heaped up another plate, with the same
diligence and speed as if it had been accepted.</P>
<P>Edgar, who had been accidentally detained, only
now entered, apologizing for being so late.</P>
<P>Engrossed by the pride of self-defence, and the
indignancy of unmerited unkindness, the disturbed
<PB N="201" REF="10"/>
mind of Camilla had not yet formed one separate
reflection, nor even admitted a distinct idea of Ed∣gar
himself, disengaged from the accusation in which
he stood involved. But he had now amply his turn.
The moment he appeared, the deepest blushes co∣vered
her face; and an emotion so powerful beat in
her breast, that the immediate impulse of her im∣petuous
feelings, was to declare herself ill, and run
out of the room.</P>
<P>With this view she rose; but ashamed of her plan,
seated herself the next moment, though she had first
overturned her plate and a sauce-boat in the vehe∣mence
of her haste.</P>
<P>This accident rather recovered than disconcerted
her, by affording an unaffected occupation, in beg∣ging
pardon of Sir Hugh, who was the chief sufferer,
changing the napkins, and restoring the table to
order.</P>
<P>“What upon earth can be the matter with Miss
Camilla, I can't guess!” exclaimed Miss Margland,
though with an expression of spite that fully contra∣dicted
her difficulty of conjecture.</P>
<P>“I hope,” said Edgar surprized, “Miss Camilla
is not ill?”</P>
<P>“I can't say I think my cousin looks very bad!”
said Indiana.</P>
<P>Camilla, who was rubbing a part of her gown
upon which nothing had fallen, affected to be too
busy to hear them: While Sir Hugh, concluding her
silent from shame, entreated her not to think of his
cloaths, which were worth no great matter, not
being his best by two or three suits. Her thoughts
had not waited this injunction; yet it was in vain she
strove to behave as if nothing had happened. Her
spirit instigated, but it would not support her; her
voice grew husky, she stammered, forgot, as she
went on, what she designed to say when she began
speaking, and frequently was forced to stop short,
with a faint laugh at herself, and with a colour every
moment encreasing. And the very instant the cloth
<PB N="202" REF="11"/>
was removed, she rose, unable to constrain herself
any longer, and ran up stairs to her own room.</P>
<P>There all her efforts evaporated in tears. “Cruel,
cruel, Miss Margland,” she cried, “unjust, unkind
Indiana! how have I merited this treatment! What
can Edgar think of my disturbance? What can I
devise to keep from his knowledge the barbarous ac∣cusation
which has caused it?”</P>
<P>In a few minutes she heard the step of Eugenia.</P>
<P>Ashamed, she hastily wiped her eyes; and before
the door could be opened, was at the further end of
the room, looking into one of her drawers.</P>
<P>“What is it that has vexed my dearest Camilla?”
cried her kind sister, “something I am sure has
grieved her.”</P>
<P>“I cannot guess what I have done with—I can
no where find—” stammered Camilla, engaged in
some apparent search, but too much confused to name
any thing of which she might probably be in want.</P>
<P>Eugenia desired to assist her, but a servant came to
the door, to tell them that the company was going
to the summer-house, whither Sir Hugh begged they
would follow.</P>
<P>Camilla besought Eugenia to join them, and make
her excu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es: but, fearing Miss Margland would at∣tribute
her absconding to guilt, or cowardice, she
bathed her eyes in cold water, and overtook her sister
at the stairs of the little building.</P>
<P>In ascending them, she heard Miss Margland say,
“I dare believe nothing's the matter but some
whim; for to be sure as to whims, Miss Camilla has
the most of any creature I ever saw, and Miss Lyn∣mere
the least; for you may imagine, Mr. Mandle∣bert,
I have pretty good opportunity to see all these
young people in their real colours.”</P>
<P>Overset by this malignancy, she was again flying
to the refuge of her own room, and the relief of
tears, when the conviction of such positive ill-will in
Miss Margland, for which she could assign no reason,
but her unjust and exclusive partiality to Indiana,
checked her precipitancy. She feared she would
<PB N="203" REF="12"/>
construe to still another whim her non-appearance, and
resuming a little fresh strength from fresh resentment,
turned back; but the various keen sensations she ex∣perienced
as she entered the summer-house, rendered
this little action the most severe stretch of fortitude,
her short and happy life had yet called upon her to
make.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh addressed her with some kind enquiries,
which she hastily answered, while she pretended to
be busy in preparing to wind some sewing silk upon
cards.</P>
<P>She could have chosen no employment less adapted
to display the cool indifference she wished to manifest
to Miss Margland and Indiana. She pulled the silk
the wrong way, twisted, twirled, and entangled it
continually; and while she talked volubly of what
she was about, as if it were the sole subject of her
thoughts, her shaking hands shewed her whole frame
disordered, and her high colour betrayed her strong
internal emotion.</P>
<P>Edgar looked at her with surprize and concern.
What had dropt from Miss Margland of her whims,
he had heard with disdain; for, without suspecting
her of malice to Camilla, he concluded her warped
by her prejudice in favour of Indiana. Dr. March∣mont,
however, had bid him judge by proof, not
appearance; and he resolved therefore to investigate
the cause of this disquiet; before he acted upon his
belief in its blamelessne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</P>
<P>Having completely spoilt one skein, she threw it
aside, and saying “the weather's so sine, I cannot
bear to stay within,”—left her silk, her winders, and
her work-bag, on the first chair, and skipt down the
stairs.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh declined walking, but would let nobody
remain with him. Edgar, as if studying the clouds,
glided down first. Camilla, perceiving him, bent
her head, and began gathering some flowers. He
stood by her a moment in silence, and then said:
“To-morrow morning without fail, I will wait upon
Mrs. Needham.”</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="13"/>
“Pray take your own time. I am not in any
haste.”</P>
<P>“You are very good, and I am more obliged to
you than I can express, for suffering my officious
interference with such patience.”</P>
<P>A rustling of silk made Camilla now look up, and
she perceived Miss Margland leaning half out of the
window of the summer-house, from earnestness to
catch what she said.</P>
<P>Angry thus to be watched, and persuaded that
both innocence and dignity called upon her to make
no change in her open consideration for Edgar, she
answered, in a voice that strove to be more audible,
but that irresistibly trembled, “I beg you will im∣partially
consult your own judgment, and decide as
you think right.”</P>
<P>Edgar, now, became as little composed as her∣self:
the power with which she invested him, pos∣sessed
a charm to dissolve every hesitating doubt;
and when, upon her raising her head, he perceived
the redness of her eyes, and found that the pertur∣bation
which had perplexed him was mingled with
some affliction, the most tender anxiety filled his
mind, and though somewhat checked by the vicinity
of Miss Margland, his voice expressed the warmest
solicitude, as he said, “I know not how to thank
you for this sweetness; but I fear something disturbs
you? I fear you are not well, or are not happy?”</P>
<P>Camilla again bent over the flowers; but it was
not to scent their fragrance; she sought only a hid∣ing
place for her eyes, which were gushing with tears;
and though she wished to fly a thousand miles off,
she had not courage to take a single step, nor force
to trust her voice with the shortest reply.</P>
<P>“You will not speak? yet you do not deny that
you have some uneasiness?—Could I give it but the
smallest relief, how fortunate I should think myself!
And is it quite impossible?—Do you forbid me to
ask what it is?—forbid me the indulgence even to
suggest—”</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="14"/>
“Ask nothing! suggest nothing! and think of
it no more!” interrupted Camilla, “if you would
not make me quite—”</P>
<P>She stopt suddenly, not to utter the word unhappy,
of which she felt the improper strength at the mo∣ment
it was quivering on her lips, and leaving her
sentence unfinished, abruptly walked away.</P>
<P>Edgar could not presume to follow, yet felt her
conquest irresistible. Her self-denial with regard to
Mrs. Arlbery won his highest approbation; her com∣pliance
with his wishes convinced him of her esteem;
and her distress, so new and so unaccountable, cen∣tered
every wish of his heart in a desire to solace, and
to revive her.</P>
<P>To obtain this privilege hastened at once and de∣termined
his measures; he excused himself, there∣fore,
from walking, and went instantly to his cham∣ber,
to reclaim, by a hasty letter to Dr. Marchmont,
his procrastinating promise.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="24" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Pro and a Con.</HEAD>
<P>WITH a pen flowing quick from feelings of
the most generous warmth, Edgar wrote the fol∣lowing
letter:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>To Dr. Marchmont.</OPENER>
<P>ACCUSE me not of precipitance, my dear Doctor,
nor believe me capable of forgetting the wisdom of
your suggestions, nor of lightly weighing those evils
with which your zeal has encompassed me, though I
write at this instant to confess a total contrariety of
sentiment, to call back every promise of delay, and
to make an unqualified avowal, that the period of
caution is past! Camilla is not happy—something,
<PB N="206" REF="15"/>
I know not what, has disturbed the gay ferenity of
her bosom: she has forbid me to enquire the cause;
—one way only remains to give me a claim to her
confidence.—O doctor! wonder not if cold, tardy,
suspicious—I had nearly said unfeeling, caution,
shrinks at such a moment, from the rising influence
of warmer sympathy, which bids me sooth her in
distress, shield her from danger, strengthen all her
virtues, and participate in their emanations!</P>
<P>You will not do me the injustice to think me ei∣ther
impelled or blinded by external enchantments;
you know me to have withstood their yet fuller blaze
in her cousin: O no! were she despoiled of all per∣sonal
attraction by the same ravaging distemper that
has been so fierce with her poor sister; were a similar

Cleves Park, Friday Evening.</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Camilla, meanwhile, shut up in her room, wept
almost without cessation, from a sense of general un∣happiness,
though fixed to no point, and from a dis∣turbance
<PB N="207" REF="16"/>
of mind, a confusion of ideas and of feelings,
that rendered her incapable of reflection. She was
again followed by Eugenia, and could no longer re∣fuse,
to her tender anxiety, a short detail of the at∣tack
which occasioned her disorder; happy, at least,
in reciting it, that by unfolding the cause, there no
longer remained any necessity to repress the effects
of her affliction.</P>
<P>To her great surprise, however, Eugenia only
said: “And is this all, my dear Camilla?”</P>
<P>“All!” exclaimed Camilla.</P>
<P>“Yes, is it all?—I was afraid some great mis∣fortune
had happened.”</P>
<P>“And what could happen more painful, more
shocking, more cruel?”</P>
<P>“A thousand things! for this is nothing but a
m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re mistake; and you should not make yourself un∣happy
about it, because you are not to blame.”</P>
<P>“Is it then nothing to be accused of designs and
intentions so criminal?”</P>
<P>“If the accusation were just, it might indeed
make you wretched: but it is Miss Margland only
who has any reason to be afflicted; for it is she
alone who has been in the wrong.”</P>
<P>Struck with this plain but uncontrovertible truth,
Camilla wiped her eyes, and strove to recover some
composure; but finding her tears still force their
way, “It is not,” she cried, with some hesitation,
“it is not the aspersions of Miss Margland alone
that give me so much vexation—the unkindness of
Indiana—”</P>
<P>“Indeed she is highly reprehensible; and so I
will tell her;—but still, if she has any fears, how∣ever
ill-founded, of losing Edgar, you cannot but
pardon—you must even pity her.”</P>
<P>Struck again, and still more forcibly, by this
second truth, Camilla, ashamed of her grief, made
a stronger and more serious effort to repress it; and
receiving soon afterwards a summons from her uncle,
her spirit rose once more to the relief of her dejec∣tion,
upon seeing him seated between Miss Mar∣gland
<PB N="208" REF="17"/>
and Indiana, and discerning that they had
been making some successful complaint, by the air
of triumph with which they waited her approach.</P>
<P>“My dear Camilla,” he cried, with a look of
much disturbance, “here's a sad ado, I find; though
I don't mean to blame you, nor young Mr. Mandle∣bert
neither, taste being a fault one can't avoid; not
but what a person's changing their mind is what I
can't commend in any one, which I shall certainly
let him know, not doubting to bring him round by
means of his own sense: only, my dear, in the
mean while, I must beg you not to stand in your
cousin's way.”</P>
<P>“Indeed, my dear uncle, I do not merit this im∣putation;
I am not capable of such treachery!”
indignantly answered Camilla.</P>
<P>“Treachery! Lord help us! treachery!” cried
Sir Hugh, fondly embracing her, “don't I know
you are as innocent as the baby unborn? and more
innocent too, from the advantage of having more
sense to guide you by! treachery, my dear Camilla!
why, I think there's nobody so good in the wide
world!—by which I mean no reflections, never
thinking it right to make any.”</P>
<P>Indiana, sullenly pouting, spoke not a word; but
Miss Margland, with a tone of plausibility that was
some covert to its malice, said “Why then all may
be well, and the young ladies as good friends as
ever, and Mr. Mandlebert return to the conduct of
a gentleman, only just by Miss Camilla's doing as she
would be done by; for nothing that all of us can
say will have any effect, if she does not discourage
him from dangling about after her in the manner he
does now, speaking to nobody else, and always ask∣ing
her opinion about every trifle, which is certainly
doing no great justice to Miss Ly<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mere.”</P>
<P>Indiana, with a toss of the head, protested his
notice was the last thing she desired.</P>
<P>“My dear Indiana,” said Sir Hugh, “don't
mind all that outward shew. Mr. Mandlebert is a
very good boy; and as to your cousin Camilla, I am
<PB N="209" REF="18"/>
sure I need not put you in mind how much she is the
same; but I really think, whatever's the reason, the
young youths of now-a-days grow backwarder and
backwarder. Though I can't say but what in my
time it was just the same; witness myself; which is
what I have been sorry for often enough, though I
have left off repenting it now, because it's of no
use; age being a thing there's no getting ahead of.”</P>
<P>“Well, then, all that remains is this,” said
Miss Margland, “let Miss Camilla keep out of Mr.
Mandlebert's way; and let her order the carriage,
and go to Mrs. Arlbery's to-morrow, and take no
notice of his likings and dislikings; and I'll be
bound for it he will soon think no more of her, and
then, of course, he will give the proper attention to
Miss Lynmere.”</P>
<P>“O, if that's all,” cried Sir Hugh, “my dear
Camilla, I am sure, will do it, and as much again
too, to make her cousin easy. And so now, I
hope, all is settled, and my two good girls will kiss
one another, and be friends; which I am sure I am
myself, with all my heart.”</P>
<P>Camilla hung her head, in speechless perturbation,
at a task which appeared to her equally hard and un∣just;
but while fear and shame kept her silent, Sir
Hugh drew her to Indiana, and a cold, yet un∣avoidable
salute, gave a species of tacit consent to
a plan which she did not dare oppose, from the very
strength of the desire that urged her opposition.</P>
<P>They then separated; Sir Hugh delighted, Miss
Margland triumphant, Indiana half satisfied, half
affronted, and Camilla with a mind so crowded, a
heart so full, she scarcely breathed. Sensations the
most contrary, of pain, pleasure, hope, and terror,
at once assailed her. Edgar, of whom so long she
had only thought as of the destined husband of In∣diana,
she now heard named with suspicions of ano∣ther
regard, to which she did not dare give full ex∣tension;
yet of which the most distant surmise made
her consider herself, for a moment, as the happiest
<PB N="210" REF="19"/>
of human beings, though she held herself the next
as the most culpable for even wishing it.</P>
<P>She found Eugenia still in her room, who, per∣ceiving
her increased emotion, tenderly enquired, if
there were any new cause.</P>
<P>“Alas! yes, my dearest Eugenia! they have
been exacting from me the most cruel of sacrifices!
They order me to fly from Edgar Mandlebert—to
resist his advice—to take the very measures I have
promised to forbear—to disoblige, to slight, to be∣have
to him even offensively! my uncle himself, le∣nient,
kind, indulgent as he is, my uncle himself
has been prevailed with to inflict upon me this terri∣ble
injunction.”</P>
<P>“My uncle,” answered Eugenia, “is incapable
of giving pain to any body, and least of all to you,
whom he loves with such fondness; he has not there∣fore
comprehended the affair; he only considers, in
general, that to please or to displease Edgar man∣dlebert
can be a matter of no moment to you, when
compared with its importance to Indiana.”</P>
<P>“It is a thousand and a thousand, a million and
a million times more important to me, than it can
ever be to her!” exclaimed the ardent Camilla,
“for she values not his kindness, she knows not his
worth, she is insensible to his virtues!”</P>
<P>“You judge too hastily, my dear Camilla; she
has not indeed your warmth of heart; but if she did
not wish the union to take place, why would she
shew all this disquiet in the apprehension of its
breach?”</P>
<P>Camilla, surprised into recollection, endeavoured
to become calmer.</P>
<P>“You, indeed,” continued the temperate Euge∣nia,
“if so situated, would not so have behaved;
you would not have been so unjust; and you could
not have been so weak; but still, if you had re∣ceived,
however causelessly, any alarm for the af∣fection
of the man you meant to marry, and that
man were as amiable as Edgar, you would have been
equally disturbed.”</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="20"/>
Camilla, convinced, yet shocked, felt the flutter
of her heart give a thousand hues to her face, and
walking to the window, leaned far out to gasp for
breath.</P>
<P>“Weigh the request more coolly, and you can∣not
refuse a short compliance. I am sure you would
not make Indiana unhappy.”</P>
<P>“O, no! not for the world!” cried she, strug∣gling
to seem more reasonable than she felt.</P>
<P>“Yet how can she be otherwise, if she imagines
you have more of the notice and esteem of Edgar
than herself?”</P>
<P>Camilla now had not a word to say; the subject
dropt; she took up a book, and by earnest internal
remonstrances, commanded herself to appear at tea-time
with tolerable serenity.</P>
<P>The evening was passed in spiritless conversation,
or in listening to the piano-forte, upon which In∣diana,
with the utmost difficulty, played some very
easy lessons.</P>
<P>At night, the following answer arrived from Dr.
Marchmont:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Edgar Mandlebert, Es{que}.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Parsonage House, Cleves,
Friday Night.
MY DEAR FRIEND,</OPENER>
<P>I must be thankful, in a moment of such enthu∣siasm,
that you can pay the attention of even recol∣lecting
those evils with which my zeal only has, you
think, encompassed you. I cannot insist upon the
practice of caution which you deem unfounded; but
as you wait my answer, I will once more open upon
my sentiments, and communicate my wishes. It is
now only I can speak them; the instant you have
informed the young lady of your own, silences them
for ever. Your honour and her happiness become
then entangled in each other, and I know not which
I would least willingly assail. What in all men is
hase, would to you, I believe, be impossible—to
<PB N="212" REF="21"/>
trifle with such favour as may be the growth of your
own undisguised partiality.</P>
<P>Your present vehemence to ascertain the perma∣nent
possession of one you conceive formed for your
felicity, obscures, to your now obsorbed faculties,
the thousand nameless, but tenacious, delicacies an∣nexed
by your species of character to your powers
of enjoyment. In two words, then, let me tell
you, what, in a short time, you will daily tell your∣self:
you cannot be happy if not exclusively loved,
for you cannot excite, you cannot bestow happiness.</P>
<P>By exclusively, I do not mean to the exclusion of
other connections and regard; far from it; those
who covet in a bride the oblivion of all former
friendships, all early affections, weaken the finest
ties of humanity, and dissolve the first compact of
unregistered but genuine integrity. The husband,
who would rather rationally than with romance be
loved himself, should seek to cherish, not obliterate
the kind feelings of nature in its first expansions.
These, where properly bestowed, are the guarantees
to that constant and respectable tenderness, which a
narrow and selfish jealousy rarely fails to convert into
distaste and disgust.</P>
<P>The partiality which I mean you to ascertain, in∣jures
not these prior claims; I mean but a partiality
exclusive of your situation in life, and of all decla∣ration
of your passion: a partiality, in fine, that is
appropriate to yourself, not to the rank in the
world with which you may tempt her ambition, nor
to the blandishments of flattery, which only soften
the heart by intoxicating the understanding.</P>
<P>Observe, therefore, if your general character, and
usual conduct, strike her mind; if her esteem is
yours without the attraction of assiduity and adula∣tion;
if your natural disposition and manners make
your society grateful to her, and your approbation
desirable.</P>
<P>It is thus alone you can secure your own content∣ment;
for it is thus alone your reflecting mind can
<PB N="213" REF="22"/>
snatch from the time to come the dangerous sur∣mises
of a dubious retrospection.</P>
<P>Remember, you can always advance; you can
never, in honour, go back; and believe me when I
tell you, that the mere simple avowal of preference,
which only ultimately binds the man, is frequently
what first captivates the woman. If her mind is not
previously occupied, it operates with such seductive
sway, it so soothes, so flatters, so betwitches her
self-complacency, that while she listens, she imper∣ceptibly
fancies she participates in sentiments, which,
but the minute before, occurred not even to her
imagination; and while her hand is the recompence
of her own eulogy, she is not herself aware if she
has bestowed it where her esteem and regard, un∣biassed
by the eloquence of acknowledged admira∣tion,
would have wished it sought, or if it has simply
been the boon of her own gratified vanity.</P>
<P>I now no longer urge your acquiescence, my dear
friend; I merely entreat you twice to peruse what I
have written, and then leave you to act by the result
of such perusal.</P>
<CLOSER>I remain
Your truly faithful and obliged
<SIGNED>GABRIEL MARCHMONT.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Edgar ran through this letter with an impatience
wholly foreign to his general character. “Why,”
cried he, “will he thus obtrude upon me these fasti∣dious
doubts and causeless difficulties? I begged but
the restitution of my promise, and he gives it me in
words that nearly annihilate my power of using it.”</P>
<P>Disappointed and displeased, he hastily put it into
his pocket-book, resolving to seek Camilla, and
commit the consequences of an interview to the im∣pulses
it might awaken.</P>
<P>He was half way down stairs, when the sentence
finishing with, “you cannot excite, you cannot
bestow happiness,” confusedly recurred to him: “If
in that,” thought he, “I fail, I am a stranger to it
myself, and a stranger for ever;” and, returning to
<PB N="214" REF="23"/>
his room, he re-opened the letter to look for the
passage.</P>
<P>The sentence lost nothing by being read a second
time; he paused upon it dejectedly, and presently
re-read the whole epistle.</P>
<P>“He is not quite wrong!” cried he, pensively;
“there is nothing very unreasonable in what he
urges: true, indeed, it is, that I can never be happy
myself, if her happiness is not entwined around my
own.”</P>
<P>The first blight thus borne to that ardent glee with
which the imagination rewards its own elevated spe∣culations,
he yet a third time read the letter.</P>
<P>“He is right!” he then cried; “I will investi∣gate
her sentiments, and know what are my chances
for her regard; what I owe to real approbation; and
what merely to intimacy of situation. I will post∣pone
all explanation till my visit here expires, and
devote the probationary interval, to an examination
which shall obviate all danger of either deceiving my
own reason, or of beguiling her inconsiderate ac∣ceptance.”</P>
<P>This settled, he rejoiced in a mastery over his
eagerness, which he considered as complete, since it
would defer for no less than a week the declaration
of his passion.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="25" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Author's Notion of Travelling.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning Camilla, sad and unwilling to
appear, was the last who entered the breakfast-par∣lour.
Edgar instantly discerned the continued un∣happiness,
which an assumed smile concealed from
the unsuspicious Sir Hugh, and the week of delay
before him seemed an outrage to all his wishes.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="24"/>
While she was drinking her first cup of tea, a
servant came in, and told her the carriage was
ready.</P>
<P>She coloured, but nobody spoke, and the servant
retired. Edgar was going to ask the design for the
morning, when Miss Margland said—“Miss Ca∣milla,
as the horses have got to go and return, you
had better not keep them waiting.”</P>
<P>Colouring still more deeply, she was going to dis∣claim
having ordered them, though well aware for
what purpose they were come, when Sir Hugh said
—“I think, my dear, you had best take Eugenia
with you, which may serve you as a companion to
talk to, in case you want to say any thing by the
way, which I take for granted; young people not
much liking to hold their tongues for a long while
together, which is very natural, having so little to
think of.”</P>
<P>“Miss Eugenia, then,” cried Miss Margland,
before Camilla could reply, “run for your cloak as
soon as you have finished your breakfast.”</P>
<P>Eugenia, hoping to aid her sister in performing a
task, which she considered as a peace-offering to In∣diana,
said, she had already done.</P>
<P>Camilla now lost all her courage for resistance; but
feeling her chag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in almost intolerable, quitted the
room with her tea undrunk, and without making
known if she should return or not.</P>
<P>Eugenia followed, and Edgar, much amazed, said,
he had forgotten to order his horse for his morning's
ride, and hastily made off: determined to be ready
to hand the sisters to the carriage, and learn whither
it was to drive.</P>
<P>Camilla, who, in flying to her room, thought of
nothing less than preparing for an excursion which
she now detested, was again surprised in tears by
Eugenia.</P>
<P>“What, my dearest Camilla,” she cried, “can
thus continually affect you? you cannot be so unhappy
without some cause!—why will you not trust your
Eugenia?”</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="25"/>
“I cannot talk,” she answered, ashamed to repeat
reasons which she knew Eugenia held to be inade∣quate
to her concern—“If there is no resource
against this persecution—if I must render myself
hateful to give them satisfaction, let us, at least, be
gone immediately, and let me be spared seeing the
person I so ungratefully offend.”</P>
<P>She then hurried down stairs; but finding Edgar
in waiting, still more quickly hurried back, and in
an agony, for which she attempted not to account,
cast herself into a chair, and told Eugenia, that if
Miss Margland did not contrive to call Edgar away,
the universe could not prevail with her to pass him in
such defiance.</P>
<P>“My dear Camilla,” said Eugenia, surprised, yet
compassionately, “if this visit is become so painful
to you, relinquish it at once.”</P>
<P>“Ah, no! for that cruel Miss Margland will then
accuse me of staying away only to follow counsel
of Edgar.”</P>
<P>She stopt; for the countenance of Eugenia said—<HI>And
is that not your motive?</HI>” A sudden consciousness
took place of her distress; she hid her face, in the
hope of concealing her emotion, and with as calm a
voice as she could attain, said, the moment they
could pass unobserved she would set off.</P>
<P>“Alas! alas!” she then cried, “into what mi∣sery
has this barbarous Miss Margland thrown me!
Eugenia herself seems now to suspect something
wrong; and so, I suppose, will my uncle; and I can
only convince them of my innocence by acting to∣wards
Edgar as a monster.—Ah! I would sooner a
thousand times let them all think me guilty!”</P>
<P>Eugenia had met Miss Margland in the hall, who,
impatient for their departure, passed her, and as∣cended
the stairs.</P>
<P>At the sound of her footsteps, the horror of her
reproaches and insinuations conquered every other
feeling, and Camilla, starting up, rushed forward,
and saying “Good morning!” ran off.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="26"/>
Edgar was still at the door, and came forward to
offer her his hand. “Pray take care of Eugenia,”
she cried, abruptly passing him, and darting, un∣aided,
into the chaise. Edgar, astonished, obeyed,
and gave his more welcome assistance to Eugenia;
but when both were seated, said—“Where shall I
tell the postillion to drive?”</P>
<P>Camilla, who was pulling one of the green blinds
up, and again letting it down, twenty times in a mi∣nute,
affected not to hear him; but Eugenia an∣swered,
“to the Grove, to Mrs. Arlbery's.”</P>
<P>The postillion had already received his orders from
Miss Margland, and drove off; leaving Edgar mute
with surprize, disappointment and mortification.</P>
<P>Miss Margland was just behind him, and conceived
this the fortunate instant for eradicating from his
mind every favourable pre-possession for Camilla; as∣suming,
therefore, an air of concern, she said—“So,
you have found Miss Camilla out, in spite of all her
precautions! she would fain not have had you know
her frolic.”</P>
<P>“Not know it! has there, then, been any plan?
did Miss Camilla intend—”</P>
<P>“O, she intends nothing in the world for two
minutes together! only she did not like you should
find out her fickleness You know, I told you,
before, she was all whim; and so you will find. You
may always take my opinion, be assured. Miss Lyn∣mere
is the only one among them that is always the
same, always good, always amiable.”</P>
<P>“And is not Miss—” he was going to say Ca∣milla,
but checking himself▪ finished with—“Miss
Eugenia, at least, always equal, always consistent?”</P>
<P>“Why, she is better than Miss Camilla; but not
one among them has any steadiness, or real sweet∣ness,
but Miss Lynmere. As to Miss Camilla, if
she has not her own way, there's no enduring her,
she frets, and is so cross. When you put her off,
in that friendly manner, from gadding after a new
acquaintance so improper for her, you set her into
such an ill humour, that she has done nothing but
<PB N="218" REF="27"/>
cry, as you may have seen by her eyes, and worry
herself and all of us round, except you, ever since;
but she was afraid of you, for fear you should take
her to task, which she hates of all things.”</P>
<P>Half incredulous, yet half shocked, Edgar turned
from his harangue in silent disgust. He knew the
splenetic nature of Miss Margland, and trusted she
might be wrong; but he knew, too, her opportunities
for observation, and dreaded lest she might be right.
Camilla had been certainly low spirited, weeping, and
restless; was it possible it could be for so slight, so
unmeaning a cause? His wish was to follow her on
horseback; but this, unauthorized, might betray
too much anxiety: he tried not to think of what had
been said by Dr. Marchmont, while this cloud hung
over her disposition and sincerity; for whatever might
be the malignity of Miss Margland, the breach of a
promise, of which the voluntary sweetness had so
lately proved his final captivation, could not be
doubted, and called aloud for explanation.</P>
<P>He mounted, however, his horse, to make his
promised enquiries of Mrs. Needham; for though
the time was already past for impeding the acquaint∣ance
from taking place, its progress might yet be
stopt, should it be found incompatible with pro∣priety.</P>
<P>The young ladies had scarce left the Park, when
Sir Hugh, recollecting a promise he had made to
Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold, of never suffering Eugenia
to go abroad unattended by some gentleman, while
Bellamy remained in the country, sent hastily to beg
that Edgar would follow the carriage.</P>
<P>Edgar was out of sight, and there was no chance
of overtaking him.</P>
<P>“Lack a-day!” said Sir Hugh, “those young
folks can never walk a horse but full gallop!” He
then resolved to ask Dr. Orkborne to go after his
pupil, and ride by the side of the chaise. He or∣dered
a horse to be saddled; and, to lose no time by
messages, the tardiness of which he had already ex∣perienced
with this gentleman, he went himself to
<PB N="219" REF="28"/>
his apartment, and after several vain rappings at his
door, entered the room unbid, saying—“Good Dr.
Orkborne, unless you are dead, which God forbid!
I think it's something uncomfortable that you can't
speak to a person waiting at your door; not that I
pretend to doubt but you may have your proper rea∣sons,
being what I can't judge.”</P>
<P>He then begged he would get booted and spurred
instantly, and follow his two nieces to Mrs. Arlbery's,
in order to take care of Eugenia; adding, “though
I'm afraid, Doctor, by your look, you don't much
listen to me, which I am sorry for; my not being
able to speak like Horace and Virgil being no fault
of mine, but my poor capacity, which no man can
be said to be answerable for.”</P>
<P>He then again entreated him to set off.</P>
<P>“Only a moment, Sir! I only beg you'll accord
me one moment!” cried the Doctor▪ with a fretful
sigh; while, screening his eyes with his left hand,
he endeavoured hastily to make a memorandum of
his ideas, before he forced them to any other subject.</P>
<P>“Really, Dr. Orkborne,” said Sir Hugh, some∣what
displeased, “I must needs remark, for a friend,
I think this rather slow: however, I can't say I am
much disappointed, now, that I did not turn out a
scholar myself, for I see, plain enough, you learned
men think nothing of any consequence but Homer
and such; which, however, I don't mean to take ill,
knowing it was like enough to have been my own
case.”</P>
<P>He then left the room, intending to send a man
and horse after the cha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, to desire his two nieces to
return immediately.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne, who, though copiously sto<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed with
the works of the ancients, had a sluggish under∣standing,
and no imagination, was entirely <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>verset
by this intrusion. The chain of his observations was
utterly broken; he strove vainly to rescue from ob∣liviou
the slow ripening fruits of his tardy concep∣tions,
and, proportioning his estimation of their
value by their labour, he not only considered his own
<PB N="220" REF="29"/>
loss as irreparable, but the whole world to be injured
by so unfortunate an interruption.</P>
<P>The recollection, however, which refused to assist
his fame, was importunate in reminding him that the
present offender was his patron; and his total want
of skill in character kept from him the just confidence
he would otherwise have placed in the unalterable
goodness of heart of Sir Hugh, whom, though he
despised for his ignorance, he feared for his power.</P>
<P>Uneasy, therefore, at his exit, which he concluded
to be made in wrath, he uttered a dolorous groan
over his papers, and compelled himself to follow,
with an apology, the innocent enemy of his glory.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, who never harboured displeasure for
two minutes in his life, was more inclined to offer an
excuse himself for what he had dropt against learning,
than to resist the slightest concession from the Doctor,
whom he only begged to make haste, the horse being
already at the door. But Dr. Orkborne, as soon as
he comprehended what was desired, revived from the
weight of sacrificing so much time; he had never
been on horseback since he was fifteen years of age,
and declared, to the wondering baronet, he could not
risk his neck by undertaking such a journey.</P>
<P>In high satisfaction, he would then have returned
to his room, p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsuaded that, when his mind was dis∣embarrassed,
a parallel between two ancient authors
which, with much painful stretch of thought, he had
suggested, and which, with the most elaborate diffi∣culty,
he was arranging and drawing up, would re∣cur
again to his memory: but Sir Hugh, always
eager in expedients, said, he should follow in the
coach, which might be ready time enough for him
to arrive at Mrs. Arlber<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> before the visit was over,
and to bring Eugenia safe back; “which,” cried
he, “is the main point, for the sake of seeing that
she goes no where else.”</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne, looking extremely blank at this
unexpected proposition, stood still.</P>
<P>“Won't you go, then, my good friend?”</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="30"/>
The Doctor, after a long pause, and in a most de∣jected
tone, sighed out, “Yes, Sir, certainly, with
the greatest—alacrity.”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, who took every thing literally that
seemed right or good-natured, thanked him, and or∣dered
the horses to be put to the coach with all pos∣sible
expedition.</P>
<P>It was soon at the door, and Dr. Orkborne, who
had spent in his room the intervening period, in moan∣ing
the loss of the time that was to succeed, and in
an opinion that two hours of this morning would
have been of more value to him than two years when
it was gone, reluctantly obeyed the call that obliged
him to descend: but he had no sooner entered the
carriage, and found he was to have it to himself, than
leaping suddenly from it, as the groom, who was to
attend him, was preparing to shut the door, he has∣tened
back to his chamber to collect a packet of
books and papers, through the means of which he
hoped to recall those flowers of rhetoric, upon which
he was willing to risk his future reputation.</P>
<P>The astonished groom, concluding something had
frightened him, jumped into the coach to find the
cause of his flight; but Sir Hugh, who was advanc∣ing
to give his final directions, called out, with some
displeasure “Hollo, there, you Jacob! if Doctor
Orkborne thinks to get you to go for my nieces in
place of himself, it's what I don't approve; which,
however, you need not take amiss, one man being
no more born with a livery upon his back than an∣other;
which God forbid I should think otherwise.
Nevertheless, my little girls must have a proper re∣spect
shewn them; which, it's surprising Dr. Ork∣borne
should not know as well as me”</P>
<P>And, much disconcerted, he walked to the par∣lour,
to ruminate upon some other measure.</P>
<P>“I am sure, your honour,” said Jacob, following
him, “I got in with no ill intention; but what it
was as come across the Doctor I don't know; but
just as I was a going to shut the door, without say∣ing
never a word, out he pops, and runs up stairs
<PB N="222" REF="31"/>
again; so I only got in to see if something had hurt
him; but I can't find nothing of no sort.”</P>
<P>Then, putting to the door, and looking sagaci∣ously,
“Please your honour,” he continued, “I
dare say it's only some maggot got into his brain from
over reading and writing; for all the maids think
he'll soon be cracked.”</P>
<P>“That's very wrong of them, Jacob; and I de∣sire
you'll tell them they must not think any such
thing.”</P>
<P>“Why, your honour don't know half, or you'd
be afraid too,” said Jacob, lowering his voice; “he's
like nothing you ever see. He won't let a chair nor
a table be dusted in his room, though they are co∣vered
over with cobowebs, because he says, it takes
him such a time to put his things to rights again;
though all the while what he calls being to rights is
just the contrary; for it's mere higgledy piggledy,
one thing heaped o'top of t'other, as if he did it for
fun.”</P>
<P>The baronet gravely answered, that if there were
not the proper shelves for his books he would order
more.</P>
<P>“Why, your honour, that's not the quarter, as
I tell you! why, when they're cleaning out his room,
if they happen but to sweep away a bit of paper as
big as my hand, he'll make believe they've done him
as much mischief as if they'd stole a thousand pound.
It would make your honour stare to hear him. Mary
says, she's sure he has never been quite right ever
since he come to the house.”</P>
<P>“But I desire you'll tell Mary I don't approve of
that opinion. Dr. Orkborne is one of the first
scholars in the world, as I am credibly informed;
and I beg you'll all respect him accordingly.”</P>
<P>“Why, your honour, if it i'n't owing to some∣thing
of that sort, why does he behave so unaccount∣able?
I myself heard him making such a noise at the
maids one day, that I spoke to Mary afterwards, and
asked her what was the matter?—“Laws, nobody
knows,” says she, “but here's the Doctor been all in
<PB N="223" REF="32"/>
a huff again; I was just a dusting his desk (says she)
and so I happened to wipe down a little bundle of
papers, all nothing but mere scraps, and he took on
as if they'd been so many guineas (says she) and he
kept me there for an hour looking for them, and
scolding, and telling such a heap of fibs, that if he
was not out of his head, would be a shame for a gen∣tleman
to say (says she).”</P>
<P>“Fie, fie, Jacob! and tell Mary fie, too. He is
a very learned gentleman, and no more a story-teller
than I am myself; which God forbid.”</P>
<P>“Why, your honour, how could this here be
true? he told the maids how they had undone him,
and the like, only because of their throwing down
them few bits of papers; though they are ready to
make oath they picked them up, almost every one;
and that they were all of a crump, and of no manner
of use.”</P>
<P>“Well, well, say no more about it, good Jacob,
but go and give my compliments to Dr. Orkborne,
and ask him, what's the reason of his changing his
mind; I mean, provided it's no secret.”</P>
<P>Jacob returned in two minutes, with uplifted hands
and eyes; “your honour,” cried he, “now you'll
believe me another time! he is worse than ever, and
I'll be bound he'll break out before another quarter.”</P>
<P>“Why, what's the matter?”</P>
<P>“Why, as sure as I'm here, he's getting together
ever so many books, and stuffing his pockets, and
cramming them under his arms, just as if he was a
porter! and when I gave him your honour's message,
I suppose it put him out, for he said, `Don't hurry
me so, I'm a coming;' making believe as if he was
only a preparing for going out, in the stead of mak∣ing
that fool of himself.”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, now really alarmed, bid him not men∣tion
the matter to any one; and was going up stairs
himself, when he saw Dr. Orkborne, heavily laden
with books in each hand, and bulging from both coat
pockets, slowly and carefully coming down.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="33"/>
“Bless me,” cried he, rather fearfully, “my dear
Sir, what are you going to do with all that library?”</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne, wishing him good morning, with∣out
attending to his question, proceeded to the car∣riage,
calling to Jacob, who stood aloof, to make
haste and open the door.</P>
<P>Jacob obeyed, but with a significant look at his
master, that said, “you see how it is, Sir!”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh following him, gently put his hand upon
his shoulder, and mildly said, “My dear friend, to
be sure you know best, but I don't see the use of
loading yourself in that manner for nothing.”</P>
<P>“It is a great loss of time, Sir, to travel without
books,” answered the Doctor, quietly arranging them
in the coach.</P>
<P>“Travel, my good friend? Why, you don't call
it travelling to go four or five miles? why, if you
had known me before my fall—However, I don't
mean to make any comparisons, you gentlemen
scholars being no particular good horsemen. How∣ever,
if you were to go one hundred miles instead of
four or five, you could not get through more than
one of those books, read as hard as you please; un∣less
you skip half, which I suppose you solid heads
leave to the lower ignoramusses.”</P>
<P>“It is not for reading, Sir, that I take all these
books, but merely to look into. There are many
of them I shall never read in my life, but I shall
want them all.”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh now stared with increased perplexity;
but Dr. Orkborne, as eager to go, since his books
were to accompany him, as before to stay, told Jacob
to bid the coachman make haste. Jacob looked at
his master, who ordered him to mount his mare, and
the carriage drove off.</P>
<P>The baronet, in some uneasiness, seated himself in
the hall, to ruminate upon what he had just heard.
The quietness and usual manner of speaking and
looking of Dr. Orkborne, which he had remarked,
removed any immediate apprehensions from the as∣sertions
of Jacob and Mary; but still he did not like
<PB N="225" REF="34"/>
the suggestion; and the carrying off so many books,
when he acknowledged he did not mean to read one
of them, disturbed him.</P>
<P>In every shadow of perplexity, his first wish was
to consult with his brother; and if he had not parted
with both his carriages, he would instantly have set
off for Etherington. He sent, however, an express
for Mr. Tyrold, begging to see him at Cleves with
all speed.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="26" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An internal Delection.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the chaise drove from Cleves Park, all
attempt at any disguise was over with Camilla, who
alive only to the horror of appearing ungrateful to
Edgar, wept without controul; and, leaning back
in the carriage, entreated Eugenia to dispense with
all conversation.</P>
<P>Eugenia, filled with pity, wondered, but com∣plied,
and they travelled near four miles in silence;
when, perceiving, over the paling round a paddock,
Mrs. Arlbery and a party of company, Camilla dried
her eyes, and prepared for her visit, of which the
impetuosity of her feelings had retarded all previous
consideration.</P>
<P>Eugenia, with true concern, saw the unfitness of
her sister to appear, and proposed walking the rest
of the way, in the hope that a little air and exercise
might compose her spirits.</P>
<P>She agreed; they alighted, and bidding the foot∣man
keep with the carriage, which they ordered
should drive slowly behind, they proceeded gently,
arm in arm, along a clean raised bank by the side of
the road, with a pace suiting at once the infirmity of
Eugenia, and the wish of delay in Camilla.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="35"/>
The sound of voices reached them from within the
paddock, though a thick shrubbery prevented their
seeing the interlocutors.</P>
<P>“Can you make out the arms?” said one.</P>
<P>“No;” answered another, “but I can see the
postillion's livery, and I am certain it is Sir Hugh
Tyrold's.”</P>
<P>“Then it is not coming hither,” said a third voice,
which they recollected for Mrs. Arlbery's; “we
don't visit: though I should not dislike to see the old
baronet. They tell me he is a humorist; and I have a
taste for all oddities: but then he has a house full of
females, and females I never admit in a morning, ex∣cept
when I have secured some men to take the en∣tertaining
them off my hands.”</P>
<P>“Whither is Bellamy running?” cried another
voice, “he's off without a word.”</P>
<P>“Gone in hopes of a rencounter, I doubt not,”
answered Mrs. Arlbery; “he made palpable aim at
one of the divinities of Cleves at the ball.”</P>
<P>Eugenia now grew uneasy. “Let us be quick,”
she whispered, “and enter the house!”</P>
<P>“Divinities! Lord! are they divinities?” said a
girlish female voice; “pray how old are they?”</P>
<P>“I fancy about seventeen.”</P>
<P>“Seventeen! gracious! I thought they'd been
quite young; I wonder they a'n't married!”</P>
<P>“I presume, then, you intend to be more expe∣ditious?
said another, whose voice spoke him to be
General Kinsale.</P>
<P>“Gracious! I hope so, for I hate an old bride.
I'll never marry at all, if I stay till I am eighteen.”</P>
<P>“A story goes about,” said the General, “that
Sir Hugh Tyrold has selected one of his nieces for
his sole heiress; but no two people agree which it
is; they have asserted it of each.”</P>
<P>“I was mightily taken with one of the girls,”
said Mrs. Arlbery; “there was something so plea∣sant
in her looks and manner, that I even felt inclined
to forgive her being younger and prettier than my∣self;
<PB N="227" REF="36"/>
but she turned out also to be more whimsical—
and that there was no enduring.”</P>
<P>Camilla, extremely ashamed, was now upon the
point of begging Eugenia to return, when a new
speech seized all her attention.</P>
<P>“Do you know, General, when that beautiful
automaton, Miss Lynmere, is to marry young Man∣dlebert?”</P>
<P>“Immediately, I understand; I am told he has
fitted up his house very elegantly for her reception.”</P>
<P>A deep sigh escaped Camilla at such publicity in
the report and belief of the engagement of Edgar
with her cousin, and brought with it a consciousness
too strong for any further self-disguise, that her dis∣tress
flowed not all from an unjust accusation: the
sound alone of the union struck as a dagger at her
heart, and told her, incontrovertibly, who was its
master.</P>
<P>Her sensations were now most painful: she grew
pale, she became sick, and was obliged, in her turn,
to lean upon Eugenia, who, affrighted to see her
thus strangely disordered, besought her to go back
to the chaise.</P>
<P>She consented, and begged to pass a few minutes
there alone. Eugenia therefore stayed without,
walking slowly upon the bank.</P>
<P>Camilla, getting into the carriage, pulled up the
blinds, and, no longer self-deceived, lamented in a
new burst of sorrow, her unhappy fate, and unpro∣pitious
attachment.</P>
<P>This consciousness, however, became soon a call
upon her integrity, and her regret was succeeded
by a summons upon propriety. She gave herself up
as lost to all personal felicity, but hoped she had dis∣covered
the tendency of her affliction, in time to
avoid the dangers, and the errors to which it might
lead. She determined to struggle without cessation
for the conquest of a partiality she deemed it trea∣chery
to indulge; and to appease any pain she now
blushed to have caused to Indiana, by strictly follow∣ing
the hard prescription of Miss Margland, and the
<PB N="228" REF="37"/>
obvious opinion of Eugenia, in shunning the society,
and no longer coveting the approbation of Edgar.
“Such, my dear father,” she cried, “would be your
lesson, if I dared consult you! such, my most ho∣noured
mother, would be your conduct, if thus
cruelly situated!”</P>
<P>This thought thrilled through every vein with
pleasure, in a sense of filial desert, and her sole de∣sire
was to return immediately to those incomparable
parents, under whose roof she had experienced no∣thing
but happiness, and in whose bosoms she hoped
to bury every tumultuous disturbance.</P>
<P>These ideas and resolutions, dejecting, yet solacing,
occupied her to the forgetfulness of her intended
visit, and even of Eugenia, till the words: “Pray
let me come to you, my dear Camilla!” made her
let down the blinds.</P>
<P>She then perceived Mr. Bellamy earnestly address∣ing
her sister.</P>
<P>He had advanced suddenly towards her, by a short
cut from the paddock, of which she was not aware,
when she was about twenty yards from the chaise.</P>
<P>She made an effort to avoid him; but he planted
himself in the way of her retreat, though with an
air of supplication, with which she strove in vain to
be angry.</P>
<P>He warmly represented the cruelty of thus flying
him, entreated but the privilege of addressing her as
a common acquaintance; and promised, upon that
condition, to submit unmurmuring to her rejection.</P>
<P>Eugenia, though in secret she thought this request
but equitable, made him no answer.</P>
<P>“O madam,” he cried, “what have I not suf∣fered
since your barbarous letter! why will you be
so amiable, yet so inexorable?”</P>
<P>She attempted to quicken her pace; but again,
in the same manner, stopping her, he exclaimed;
“Do not kill me by this disdain! I ask not now for
favour or encouragement—I know my hard doom—I
ask only to converse with you—though, alas! it
was by conversing with you I lost my heart.”</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="38"/>
Eugenia felt softened; and her countenance, which
had forfeited nothing of expression, though every
thing of beauty, soon shewed Bellamy his advantage.
He pursued it eagerly; depicted his passion, depre∣cated
her severity, extolled her virtues and accom∣plishments,
and bewailed his unhappy, hopeless flame.</P>
<P>Eugenia, knowing that all she said, and believing
that all she heard issued from the fountain of truth,
became extremely distressed. “Let me pass, I con∣jure
you, Sir,” she cried, “and do not take it ill—but
I cannot hear you any longer.”</P>
<P>The vivacity of bright hope flashed into the spark∣ling
eyes of Bellamy, at so gentle a remonstrance;
and entreaties for lenity, declarations of passion, pro∣fessions
of submission, and practice of resistance, as∣sailed
the young Eugenia with a rapidity that con∣founded
her: she heard him with scarce any oppo∣sition,
from a fear of irritating his feelings, joined
to a juvenile embarrassment how to treat with more
severity so sincere and so humble a suppliant.</P>
<P>From this situation, to the extreme provocation of
Bellamy, she was relieved by the appearance of Major
Cerwood, who having observed, from the paddock,
the slow motion of the carriage, had come forth to
find out the cause.</P>
<P>Eugenia seized the moment of interruption to
press forward, and make the call to her sister already
mentioned; Bellamy accompanying and pleading,
but no longer venturing to stop her: he handed her,
therefore, to the chaise, where Major Cerwood also
paid his compliments to the two ladies; and hearing
they were going to the seat of Mrs. Arlbery, whi∣ther
Camilla now forced herself, though more un∣willingly
than ever, he ran on, with Bellamy, to be
ready to hand them from the carriage.</P>
<P>They were shewn into a parlour, while a servant
went into the garden to call his mistress.</P>
<P>This interval was not neglected by either of the
gentlemen, for Bellamy was scarce more eager to en∣gage
the attention of Eugenia, than the Major to
force that of Camilla. By Lionel he had been in∣formed
<PB N="230" REF="39"/>
she was heiress of Cleves; he deemed, there∣fore,
the opportunity by no means to be thrown away,
of making, what he believed required opportunity
alone, a conquest of her young heart. Accustomed
to think compliments always welcome to the fair, he
construed her sadness into softness, and imputed her
silence to the confusing impression made upon an in∣experienced
rural beauty, by the first assiduities of a
man of figure and gallantry.</P>
<P>In about a quarter of an hour the servant of Mrs.
Arlbery slowly returned, and, with some hesitation,
said his lady was not at home. The gentlemen looked
provoked, and Camilla and Eugenia, much discon∣certed
at so evident a denial, left their names, and
returned to their carriage.</P>
<P>The journey back to Cleves was mute and dejected:
Camilla was shocked at the conscious state of her
own mind, and Eugenia was equally pensive. She
began to think with anxiety of a contract with a
person wholly unknown, and to consider the passion
and constancy of Bellamy as the emanations of a truly
elevated mind, and meriting her most serious gra∣titude.</P>
<P>At the hall door they were eagerly met by Sir
Hugh, who, with infinite surprise, enquired where
they had left Dr. Orkborne.</P>
<P>“Dr. Orkborne?” they repeated, “we have not
even seen him.”</P>
<P>“Not seen him? did not he come to fetch you?”</P>
<P>“No, Sir.”</P>
<P>“Why, he went to Mrs. Arlbery's on purpose!
And what he stays for at that lady's, now you are
both come away, is a thing I can't pretend to judge
of; unless he has stopt to read one of those books he
took with him; which is what I dare say is the case.”</P>
<P>“He cannot be at Mrs. Arlbery's, Sir,” said
Eugenia, “for we have but this moment left her
house.”</P>
<P>“He must be there, my dear girls, for he's no
where else. I saw him set out myself, which, how∣ever,
<PB N="231" REF="40"/>
I shan't mention the particulars of, having sent
for my brother, whom I expect every minute.”</P>
<P>They then concluded he had gone by another road,
as there were two ways to the Grove.</P>
<P>Edgar did not return to Cleves till the family were
assembling to dinner. His visit to Mrs. Needham
had occasioned him a new disturbance. She had
rallied him upon the general rumour of his approach∣ing
marriage; and his confusion, from believing his
partiality for Camilla detected, was construed into a
confirmation of the report concerning Indiana. His
disavowal was rather serious than strong, and invo∣luntarily
mixt with such warm eulogiums of the ob∣ject
he imagined to be meant, that Mrs. Needham,
who had only named <HI>a certain fair one at Cleves,</HI>
laughed at his denial, and thought the engagement
undoubted.</P>
<P>With respect to his enquiries relative to Mrs. Arl∣bery,
Mrs. Needham said, that she was a woman far
more agreeable to the men, than to her own sex;
that she was full of caprice, coquetry, and singu∣larity;
yet, though she abused the gift, she possessed
an excellent and uncommon understanding. She was
guilty of no vices, but utterly careless of appear∣ances,
and though her character was wholly unim∣peached,
she had offended or frightened almost all the
county around, by a wilful strangeness of behaviour,
resulting from an undaunted determination to follow
in every thing the bent of her own humour.</P>
<P>Edgar justly deemed this a dangerous acquaintance
for Camilla, whose natural thoughtlessness and vi∣vacity
made him dread the least imprudence in the
connexions she might form; yet, as the reputation
of Mrs. Arlbery was unsullied, he felt how difficult
would be the task of demonstrating the perils he
feared.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, during the dinner, was exceedingly
disturbed. “What Dr. Orkborne can be doing with
himself,” said he, “is more than any man can tell,
for he certainly would not stay at that lady's, when
he found you were both come away; so that I begin
<PB N="232" REF="41"/>
to think it's ten to one but he's gone nobody knows
where! for why else should he take all those books?
which is a thing I have been thinking of ever since;
especially as he owned himself he should never read
one half of them. If he has taken something amiss,
I am very ready to ask his pardon; though what it
can be I don't pretend to guess.”</P>
<P>Miss Margland said, he was so often doing some∣thing
or other that was ill-bred, that she was not at
all surprised he should stay out at dinner time. He
had never yet setched her a chair, nor opened the
door for her, since he came to the house; so that she
did not know what was too bad to expect.</P>
<P>As they were rising from the table, a note arrived
from Mr. Tyrold, with an excuse, that important
business would prevent his coming to Cleves till the
next day. Camilla then begged permission to go in
the chaise that was to fetch him, flattering herself
something might occur to detain her, when at Ether∣ington.
Sir Hugh readily assented, and composing
himself for his afternoon nap, desired to be awaked if
Dr. Orkborne came back.</P>
<P>All now left the room except Camilla, who, taking
up a book, stood still at a window, till she was aroused
by the voice of Edgar, who, from the Park, asked
her what she was reading.</P>
<P>She turned over the leaves, ashamed at the ques∣tion,
to look for the title; she had held the book
mechanically, and knew not what it was.</P>
<P>He then produced the promised nosegay, which
had been brought by his gardener during her excur∣sion.
She softly lifted up the sash, pointing to her
sleeping uncle; he gave it her with a silent little
bow, and walked away; much disappointed to miss
an opportunity from which he had hoped for some
explanation.</P>
<P>She held it in her hand some time, scarcely sen∣sible
she had taken it, till, presently, she saw its buds
bedewed with her falling tears.</P>
<P>She shook them off, and pressed the nosegay to her
bosom. “This, at least,” she cried, “I may ac∣cept,
<PB N="233" REF="42"/>
for it was offered me before that barbarous at∣tack.
Ah! they know not the innocence of my
regard, or they would not so wrong it! The uni∣verse
could not tempt me to injure my cousin, though
it is true, I have valued the kindness of Edgar—and
I must always value it!—These flowers are more
precious to me, coming from his hands, and reared
in his grounds, than all the gems of the East could
be from any other possessor. But where is the guilt
of such a preference? And who that knows him
could help feeling it?”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh now awakening from a short slumber,
exclaimed—“I have just found out the reason why
this poor gentleman has made off; I mean, provided
he is really gone away, which, however, I hope not:
but I think, by his bringing down all those books,
he meant to give me a broad hint, that he had got
no proper book-case to keep them in; which the
maids as good as think too.”</P>
<P>“Then, calling upon Camilla, he asked if she was
not of that opinion.</P>
<P>“Y—e—s, Sir,” she hesitatingly answered.</P>
<P>“Well, then, my dear, if we all think the same,
I'll give orders immediately for getting the better of
that fault.”</P>
<P>Miss Margland, curious to know how Camilla was
detained, now re-entered the room. Struck with
the fond and melancholy air with which she was
bending over her nosegay, she abruptly demanded—
“Pray, where might you get those flowers?”</P>
<P>Covered with shame, she could make no answer.</P>
<P>“O, Miss Camilla! Miss Camilla!—ought not
those flowers to belong to Miss Lynmere?”</P>
<P>“Mr. Mandlebert had promised me them yester∣day
morning,” answered she, in a voice scarce au∣dible.</P>
<P>“And is this fair, Ma'am?—can you reckon it
honourable?—I'll be judged by Sir Hugh himself.
Do you think it right, Sir, that Miss Camilla should
accept nosegays every day from Mr. Mandlebert,
when her cousin has had never a one at all?”</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="43"/>
“Why, it's not her fault, you know, Miss Mar∣gland,
if young Mr. Mandlebert chuses to give them
to her. However, if that vexes Indiana, I'm sure
my niece will make them over to her, with the
greatest pleasure; for I never knew the thing she
would not part with, much more a mere little smell
at the nose, which, whether one has it or not, can't
much matter after it's over.”</P>
<P>Miss Margland now exultingly held out her hand:
the decision was obliged to be prompt; Camilla de∣livered
up the flowers, and ran into her own room.</P>
<P>The sacrifice, cried she, is now complete! Edgar
will conclude I hate him, and believe Indiana loves
him!—no matter!—it is fitting he should think both.
I will be steady this last evening, and to-morrow I
will quit this fatal roof!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Author's Opinion of Visiting.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN summoned to tea, Camilla, upon enter∣ing
the parlour, found Sir Hugh in mournful dis∣course
with Edgar upon the non-appearance of Dr.
Orkborne. Edgar felt a momentary disappointment
that she did not honour his flowers with wearing
them; but consoled himself with supposing she had
preserved them in water. In a few minutes, how∣ever,
Indiana appeared with them in her bosom.</P>
<P>Almost petrified, he turned towards Camilla, who,
affecting an air of unconcern, amused herself with
patting a favourite old terrier of her uncle's.</P>
<P>As soon as he could disengage himself from the
Baronet, he leant also over the dog, and, in a low
voice, said—“You have discarded, then, my poor
flowers?”</P>
<P>“Have I not done right?” answered she, in the
same tone; “are they not where you must be far
happier to see them?”</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="44"/>
“Is it possible,” exclaimed he, “Miss Camilla
Tyrold can suppose—” He stopt, for surprised off
his guard, he was speaking loud, and he saw Miss
Margland approaching.</P>
<P>“Don't you think, Mr. Mandlebert,” said she,
“that Miss Lynmere becomes a bouquet very much?
she took a fancy to those flowers, and I think they
are quite the thing for her.”</P>
<P>“She does them,” he coldly answered, “too
much honour.”</P>
<P>Ah, Heaven! he loves her not! thought Camilla,
and, while trembling between hope and terror at the
suggestion, determined to redouble her circumspec∣tion,
not to confirm the suspicion that his indiffer∣ence
was produced by her efforts to attach him to
herself.</P>
<P>She had soon what she conceived to be an occasion
for its exertion. When he handed her some cakes,
he said—“You would think it, I conclude, imper∣tinent
to hear any thing more concerning Mrs. Arl∣bery,
now you have positively opened an acquaint∣ance
with her?”</P>
<P>She felt the justice of this implied reproach of her
broken promise; but she saw herself constantly
watched by Miss Margland, and repressing the apo∣logy
she was sighing to offer, only answered—“You
have nothing, you own, to say against her reputa∣tion—and
as to any thing else—”</P>
<P>“True,” interrupted he, “my information on
that point is all still in her favour: but can it be Miss
Camilla Tyrold, who holds that to be the sole ques∣tion
upon which intimacy ought to depend? Does
she account as nothing manners, disposition, way of
life?”</P>
<P>“No, not absolutely as nothing,” said she, rising;
“but taste settles all those things, and mine is en∣tirely
in her favour.”</P>
<P>Edgar gravely begged her pardon, for so offici∣ously
resuming an irksome subject; and returning to
Sir Hugh, endeavoured to listen to his lamentations
and conjectures about Dr. Orkborne.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="45"/>
He felt, however, deeply hurt. In naming Mrs.
Arlbery, he had flattered himself he had opened an
opportunity for which she must herself be waiting, to
explain the motives of her late visit: but her light
answer put an end to that hope, and her quitting her
seat shewed her impatient of further counsel.</P>
<P>Not a word that fell from Sir Hugh reached his
ear: but he bowed from time to time, and the good
Baronet had no doubt of his attention. His eyes
were perpetually following Camilla, though they met
not a glance from her in return. She played with
the terrier, talked with Eugenia, looked out of the
window, turned over some books, and did every thing
with an air of negligence, that, while it covered ab∣sence
and anxiety, displayed a studied avoidance of
his notice.</P>
<P>The less he could account for this, the more it of∣fended
him. And dwells caprice, thought he, while
his eye followed her, even there! in that fair com∣position!—
where may I look for singleness of mind,
for nobleness of simplicity, if caprice, mere girlish,
unmeaning caprice, dwell there!</P>
<P>The moment she had finished her tea, she left the
room, to shorten her cruel task. Struck with the
broken sentence of “is it possible Miss Camilla Ty∣rold
can suppose—” the soft hope that his heart
was untouched by Indiana, seized her delighted ima∣gination;
but the recollection of Miss Margland's
assertions, that it was the real right of her cousin,
soon robbed the hope of all happiness, and she could
only repeat—To-morrow I will go!—I ought not to
think of him!—I had rather be away—to-morrow
I will go!</P>
<P>She had hardly quitted the parlour, when the dis∣tant
sound of a carriage roused Sir Hugh from his
fears; and, followed by Edgar and the ladies, he
made what haste he could into the court-yeard, where,
to his infinite satisfaction, he saw his coach driving
in.</P>
<P>He ordered it should stop immediately, and called
out—“Pray, Dr. Orkborne, are you there?”</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="46"/>
Dr. Orkborne looked out of the window, and
bowed respectfully.</P>
<P>“Good lack, I could never have thought I should
be so glad to see you! which you must excuse, in
point of being no relation. You are heartily wel∣come,
I assure you; I was afraid I should never see
you again; for, to tell you the honest truth, which
I would not say a word of before, I had got a notion
you were going out of your mind.”</P>
<P>The Doctor took not the smallest heed of this
speech, and the carriage drove up to the door. Sir
Hugh then seating himself under the portico, said—
“Pray, Dr. Orkborne, before you go to your studies,
may I just ask you how you came to stay out all day?
and why you never fetched Eugenia? for I take it
for granted it's no secret, on the account Jacob was
with you; besides the coachman and horses.”</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne, though not at all discomposed by
these questions, nor by his reception, answered, that
he must first collect his books.</P>
<P>“The poor girls,” continued the Baronet, “came
home quite blank; not that they knew a word of
my asking you to go for them, till I told them;
which was lucky enough, for the sake of not frighten∣ing
them. However, where you can have been,
particularly with regard to your dinner, which▪ I sup∣pose,
you have gone without, is what I can't guess;
unless you'd be kind enough to tell me.”</P>
<P>The Doctor, too busy to hear him, was packing
up his books.</P>
<P>“Come, never mind your books,” said Sir Hugh;
“Jacob can carry them for you, or Bob, or any body.
Here, Bob, (calling to the postillion, who, with all the
rest of the servants, had been drawn by curiosity into the
court-yard) whisk me up those books, and take them
into the Doctor's room; I mean, provided you can
find a place for them, which I am sorry to say there
is none; owing to my not knowing better in point
of taking the proper care; which I shall be sure to
do for the future.”</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="47"/>
The boy obeyed, and mounting one step of he
coach, took what were within his reach; which, when
the Doctor observed, he snatched away with great
displeasure, saying, very solemnly, he had rather at
any time be knocked down, than see any body touch
one of his books or papers.</P>
<P>Jacob, coming forward, whispered his master not
to interfere; assuring him, he was but just got out of
one of his tantarums.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, a little startled, rose to return to the
parlour, begging Dr. Orkborne to take his own time,
and not to hurry himself.</P>
<P>He then beckoned Jacob to follow him.</P>
<P>“There is certainly something in all this,” said he
to Edgar, “beyond what my poor wit can compre∣hend:
but I'll hear what Jacob has to say before I
form a complete judgment; though, to be sure, his
lugging out all those books to go but four or five
miles, has but an odd look; which is what I don't
like to say.”</P>
<P>Jacob now was called upon to give a narrative of
the day's adventures. “Why, your Honour,” said
he, as soon as we come to the Grove, “I goes up to
the coach door, to ask the Doctor if he would get
out▪ or only send in to let the young ladies know he
was come for them; but he was got so deep into
some of his larning, that, I dare say▪ I bawled it
three good times in his ears, before he so much as
lifted up his head; and then it was only to say, I put
him out! and to it he went again, just as if I'd said
never a word; till, at last, I was so plaguy mad, I
gives the coach such a jog, o bring him to himself
like, that it jerked the pencil and paper out of his
hand So then he went straight into one of his
takings, pretending I had made him forget all his
thoughts, and such like out of the way talk, after
his old way. So when I found he was going off in
that manner, I thought it only time lost to say no
more to him, and so I turned me about not to mind
him; when I sees a whole heap of company at a
parlour window, laughing so hearty, that I was sure
<PB N="239" REF="48"/>
they had heard us. And a fine comely lady, as
clever as ever you see, that I found after was the lady
of the house, bid me come to the window, and
asked what I wanted. So I told her we was come
for two of the Miss Tyrolds. Why, says she,
they've been gone a quarter of an hour, by the op∣posite
road. So then I was coming away, but she
made me a sign to come into the parlour, for all it
was brimful of fine company, dressed all like I don't
know what. It was as pretty a sight as you'd wish
to see. And then, your honour, they all begun
upon me at once! There was such a clatter, I
thought I'd been turned into a booth at a fair; and
merry enough they all was sure!—'specially the lady,
who never opened her lips, but what they all
laughed: but as to all what they asked me, I could
as soon conjure a ghost as call a quarter of it to
mind.”</P>
<P>“Try, however,” said Edgar, curious for fur∣ther
information of whatever related to Mrs.
Arlbery.</P>
<P>“Why as to that, 'squire,” answered Jacob,
with an arch look, “I am not so sure and certain
you'd like to hear it all.”</P>
<P>“No? and why not?”</P>
<P>“O! pray tell, Jacob,” cried Miss Margland;
“did they say any thing of Mr. Mandlebert?”</P>
<P>“Yes, and of more than Mr. Mandlebert,” said
Jacob, grinning.</P>
<P>“Do tell, do tell,” cried Indiana, eagerly.</P>
<P>“I'm afeard, Miss!”</P>
<P>Every body assured him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o offence should be
taken.</P>
<P>“Well, then, if you must needs know▪ there
was not one of you, but what they had a pluck at.—Pray,
says one of them, what does the old gen∣tleman
do with all those books and papers in the
coach?—That's what nobody knows, says I, unless
his head's cracked, which is Mary's opinion.—Then
they all laughed more and more, and the lady of the
house said:—Pray can he really read?—Whoo!
<PB N="240" REF="49"/>
says I, why he does nothing else; he's at it from
morning till night, and Mary says she's sure before
long he'll give up his meat and drink for it.—I've al∣ways
heard he was a quiz, says another, or a quoz,
or some such word; but I did not know he was such
a book-worm.—The old quoz is generous, however,
I hear, says another, pray do you find him so?—As
to that, I can't say, says I, for I never see the co∣lour
of his money.—No! then, what are you such
a fool as to serve him for?—So, then, your honour,
I found, owing to the coach and the arms, and the
like, they thought all the time it was your honour
was in the coach. I hope your honour don't take it
amiss of me?”</P>
<P>“Not at all, Jacob; only I don't know why they
call me an old quiz and quoz for; never having of∣fended
them; which I take rather unkind; espe∣cially
not knowing what it means.”</P>
<P>“Why, your honour, they're such comical sort
of folks; they don't mind what they say of no∣body.
Not but what the lady of the house is a rare
gentlewoman. Your honour could not help liking
her. I warrant she's made many a man's heart
ache, and then jumped for joy when she'd done.
And as to her eyes, I think in my born days I never
see nothing like 'em: they shines like two candles
on a dark night afar off on the common—.”</P>
<P>“Why Jacob,” said Sir Hugh, “I see you have
lost your heart. However, go on.”</P>
<P>“Why, as soon as I found out what they
meant—That my master? says I, no, God be
thanked! What should I have to live upon if a was?
Not so much as a cobweb! for there would not be
wherewithal for a spider to make it.”</P>
<P>Here Sir Hugh, with much displeasure, inter∣rupted
him; “As to the poor gentleman's being
poor,” said he, “it's no fault of his own, for he'd
be rich if he could, I make no doubt; never having
heard he was a gambler. Besides which, I alway<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
respect a man the more for being poor, knowing how
<PB N="241" REF="50"/>
little a rich man may have in him; which I can
judge by my own case.”</P>
<P>Jacob proceeded.</P>
<P>“Well, if it is not Sir Hugh, says one of them,
who is it?—Why, it's only our Latin master, says
I; upon which they all set up as jolly a laugh again
as ever I heard in my days. Jobbins, they're pure
merry!—And who learns Latin? says one, I hope
they don't let him work at poor old Sir Hugh? No,
says I, they tried their hands with him at first, but
he thanked 'em for nothing. He soon grew tired
on't.—So then they said, who learns now, says they,
do you?—Me! says I, no God be praised, I don't
know <HI>A</HI> from <HI>B,</HI> which is the way my head's so
clear, never having muddled it with what I don't
understand.—And so then they all said I was a brave
fellow; and they ordered me a glass of wine.”</P>
<P>What a set! thought Edgar, is this, idle, dissi∣pated,
curious—for Camilla to associate with!—the
lively, the unthinking, the inexperienced Camilla!</P>
<P>“So then they asked me, says they, does Miss
Lynmere learn, says they?—Not, as I know of,
says I, she's no great turn for her book, as ever I
heard of; which I hope Miss you won't take ill,
for they all said, no, to be sure, she's too handsome
for that.”</P>
<P>Indiana looked uncertain whether to be flattered
or offended.</P>
<P>“But you have not told us what they said of Mr.
Mandlebert yet?” cried Miss Margland.</P>
<P>“No, I must come to you first, Miss,” answered
he, “for that's what they come upon next. But
may hap I must not tell?”</P>
<P>“O yes, you may;” said she, growing a little
apprehensive of some affront, but determined not to
seem hurt by it; “I am very indifferent to any thing
they can say of me, assure yourself!”</P>
<P>“Why, I suppose, says they, this Latin master
studies chiefly with the governess?—They'd study
fifty-cuffs I believe, if they did, says I, for she
<PB N="242" REF="51"/>
hates him like poison; and there's no great love lost
between them.”</P>
<P>“And what right had you to say that, Mr.
Jacob? I did not ask what you said. Not that I
care, I promise you!”</P>
<P>“Why, some how, they got it all out; they
were so merry and so full of their fun, I could not
be behind hand. But I hope no offence?”</P>
<P>“O dear no! I'm sure it's not worth while.”</P>
<P>“They said worse than I did,” resumed Jacob,
“by a deal; they said, says they, she looks duced
crabbed—she looks just as if she was always eating a
sour apple, says the lady; she looks—”</P>
<P>“Well, well, I don't want to hear any more of
their opinions. I may look as I please I hope. I
hate such gossiping.”</P>
<P>“So then they said, pray does Miss Camilla
learn? says they;—Lord love her, no! says I.”</P>
<P>“And what said they to that?” cried Edgar.</P>
<P>“Why, they said, they hoped not, and they
were glad to hear it, for they liked her the best of
all. And what does the ugly one do? says they.—”</P>
<P>“Come, we have heard enough now,” inter∣rupted
Edgar, greatly shocked for poor Eugenia,
who fortunately, however, had retired with Camilla.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh too, angrily broke in upon him, say∣ing:
“I won't have my niece called ugly, Jacob!
you know it's against my commands such a thing's
being mentioned.”</P>
<P>“Why, I told 'em so, Sir,” said Jacob; “ugly
one, says I, she you call the ugly one, is one of the
best ladies in the land. She's ready to lend a hand
to every mortal soul; she's just like my master for
that. And as to learning, I make no quaery she can
talk you over the Latin grammar as fast as e'er a gen∣tleman
here. So then they laughed harder than
ever, and said they should be▪ afeard to speak to her,
and a deal more I can't call to mind.—So then they
come to Mr. Mandlebert. Pray, says they, what's
he doing among you all this time?—Why, nothing
particular, says I, he's only squiring about our
<PB N="243" REF="52"/>
young ladies.—But when is this wedding to be? says
another. So then I said—”</P>
<P>“What did you say?” cried Edgar hastily.</P>
<P>“Why—nothing,” answered Jacob, drawing
back.</P>
<P>“Tell us, however, what they said,” cried Miss
Margland.</P>
<P>“Why, they said, says they, every thing has
been ready some time at Beech Park;—and they'll
make as handsome a couple as ever was seen.”</P>
<P>“What stuff is this!” cried Edgar, “do
prithee have done.”—</P>
<P>“No, no,” said Miss Margland; “go on,
Jacob!”</P>
<P>Indiana, conscious and glowing at the words
handsome couple, could not restrain a simper; but
Edgar, thinking only of Camilla, did not under∣stand
it.</P>
<P>“He'll have trouble enough, says one of the
gentlemen,” continues Jacob, “to take care of so
pretty a wife.—She'll be worth a little trouble, says
another, for I think she is the most beautifullest girl
I ever see—Take my word of it, says the lady of
the house, young Mandlebert is a man who won't be
made a fool of; he'll have his own way, for all her
beauty.”</P>
<P>“What a character to give of me to young
ladies!” cried Edgar, doubtful, in his turn, whe∣ther
to be hurt or gratified.</P>
<P>“O she did not stop at that, Sir,” resumed Ja∣cob,
“for she said, I make no question, says she,
but in half a year he'll lock her up.”</P>
<P>Indiana, surprized, gave an involuntary little
shriek: but Edgar, not imputing it to any appro∣priate
alarm, was filled with resentment against Mrs.
Arlbery. What incomprehensible injustice! he said
to himself: O Camilla! is it possible any event, any
circumstance upon earth, could induce me to prac∣tise
such an outrage? to degenerate into such a
savage?</P>
<P>“Is this all?” asked Miss Margland.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="53"/>
“No, ma'am; but I don't know if Miss will
like to hear the rest.”</P>
<P>“O yes,” said Indiana, “if it's about me, I
don't mind.”</P>
<P>“Why, they all said, Miss, you'd make the
most finest bride that ever was seen, and they did
not wonder at Mr. Mandlebert's chusing you; but
for all that—.”</P>
<P>He stopt, and Edgar, who, following the bent
of his own thoughts, had till now concluded Ca∣milla
to be meant, was utterly confounded by dis∣covering
his mistake. The presence of Indiana re∣doubled
the aukwardness of the situation, and her
blushes, and the increased lustre of her eyes, did
not make the report seem either unwelcome, or per∣fectly
new to her.</P>
<P>Miss Margland raised her head triumphantly.
This was precisely such a circumstance as she flat∣tered
herself would prove decisive.</P>
<P>The Baronet, equally pleased, returned her nod
of congratulation, and nodding himself towards
Edgar, said; “you're blown, you see! but what
matters secrets about nothing? which, Lord help
me, I never knew how to keep.”</P>
<P>Edgar was now still more disconcerted, and,
from mere distress what to say or do, bid Jacob
go on.</P>
<P>“Why then, they said a deal more, how pretty
she was, he continued, but they did not know how
it would turn out, for the young lady was so much
admired, that her husband had need look sharp after
her; and if—”</P>
<P>“What complete impertinence!” cried Edgar,
walking about the room; “I really can listen no
longer.”</P>
<P>“If he had done wisely; says the lady of the
house, he would have left the professed beauty, and
taken that pretty Camilla.”</P>
<P>Edgar surprized, stopt short; this seemed to him
less impertinent.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="54"/>
“Camilla is a charming creature, says she;
though she may want a little watching too; but so
does every thing that is worth having.”</P>
<P>That woman does not want discernment, thought
Edgar, nor she does not want taste.—I can never to∣tally
dislike her, if she does such justice to Camilla.</P>
<P>He now again invited Jacob to proceed; but In∣diana,
with a po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting lip, walked out of the room,
and Miss <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> said, there was no need to be
hearing him all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ght.</P>
<P>Jacob, therefore, when no more either inter∣rupted
or encouraged, soon finished his narrative.
Mrs Arlbery, amused by watching Dr. Orkborne,
had insisted, for an experiment, that Jacob should
not return to the coach till he was missed and called
for; and so intense was the application of the Doc∣tor
to what he was composing, that this did not
happen till the whole family had dined; Jacob and
the coachman, at the invitation of Mrs. Arlbery,
having partaken of the servants fare, equally pleased
with the regale and the joke. Dr. Orkborne then,
suddenly recollecting himself, demanded why the
young ladies were so late, and was much discom∣posed
and astonished when he heard they were gone.
Mrs. Arlbery invited him into the house, and
offered him refreshments, while she o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dered water
and a feed of corn for the horses; but he only fret∣ted
a little, and then went on again with his
studies.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh now sent some cold dinner into the
Doctor's room, and declared he should always ap∣prove
his niece's acquaintance with Mrs. Arlbery, as
she was so kind to his servants and his animals.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="28" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Author's Idea of Order.</HEAD>
<P>NOT a bosom of the Cleves party enjoyed much
tranquillity this evening. Miss Margland, though
<PB N="246" REF="55"/>
to the Baronet she would not recede from her first as∣sertions,
strove vainly to palliate to herself the ill
grace and evident dissatisfaction with which Edgar
had met the report. To save her own credit, how∣ever,
was always her primary consideration; she re∣solved,
therefore, to cast upon unfair play in Ca∣milla,
or upon the instability of Edgar, all the
blame really due to her own undiscerning self-sufficiency.</P>
<P>Indiana thought so little for herself, that she
adopted, of course, every opinion of Miss Mar∣gland;
yet the immoveable coldness of Edgar, con∣trasted
frequently in her remembrance by the fervour
of Melmond and of Macdersey, became more and
more distasteful to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er; and Mrs. Arlbery's idea,
that she should be locked up in half a year, made her
look upon him alternately as something to shun or to
over-reach. She even wished to refuse him:—but
Beech Park, the equipage, the servants, the bridal
habiliment.—No! she could enjoy those, if not
him. And neither her own feelings, nor the lessons
of Miss Margland, had taught her to look upon
marriage in any nobler point of view.</P>
<P>But the person most deeply dissatisfied this evening
was Edgar. He n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w saw that, deceived by his own
consciousness, he had misunderstood Mrs. Needham,
who, as well as Mrs. Arlbery, he was convinced
concluded him engaged to Indiana. He had ob∣served
with concern the approving credulity of Sir
Hugh, and though glad to find his real plan, and
all his wishes unsuspected, the false report excited his
fears, lest Indiana should give it any credit, and se∣cretly
hurt his delicacy for the honour of his
taste.</P>
<P>All the influence of pecuniary motives to which
he deemed Camilla superior, occurred to him in the
very words of Dr. Marchmont for Indiana; whose
capacity he saw was as shallow as her person was
beautiful. Yet the admiration with which she had
already made her first appearance in the world,
might naturally induce her belief of his reported
<PB N="247" REF="56"/>
devotion. If, therefore, his situation appeared to
her to be eligible, she had probably settled to accept
him.</P>
<P>The most timid female delicacy was not more scru∣pulous,
than the manly honour of Edgar to avoid
this species of misapprehension; and though per∣fectly
confident his behaviour had been as irreproach∣able
as it was undesigning, the least idea of any self-delusion
on the part of Indiana, seemed a call upon
his integrity for the most unequivocal manifestation of
his intentions. Yet any declaration by words, with
whatever care selected, might be construed into an
implication that he concluded the decision in his
own hands. And though he could scarcely doubt
the fact, he justly held nothing so offensive as the
palpable presumption. One only line of conduct
appeared to him, therefore, unexceptionable; which
was wholly to avoid her, till the rumour sunk into
its own nothingness.</P>
<P>This demanded from him a sacrifice the most pain∣ful,
that of retiring from Cleves in utter ignorance
of the sentiments of Camilla; yet it seemed the
more necessary, since he now, with much uneasiness,
recollected many circumstances which his absorbed
mind had hitherto suffered to pass unnoticed, that
led him to fear Sir Hugh himself, and the whole
party, entertained the same notion.</P>
<P>He was shocked to consider Camilla involved in
such a deception, though delighted by the idea that
he might perhaps owe to an explanation, some marks
of that preference for which Dr. Marchm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt had
taught him to wait, and which he now hoped might
lie dormant from the persuasion of his engagement.
To clear this mistake was, therefore, every way es∣sential,
as otherwise the very purity of her character
must be in his disfavour.</P>
<P>Still, however, the visit to the Grove hung upon
his mind, and he resolved to investigate its cause the
following morning, before he made his retreat.</P>
<P>Early the next day, Camilla sent to hasten the
chaise which was to fetch Mr. Tyrold, and begged
<PB N="248" REF="57"/>
leave of her uncle to breakfast at Etherington. His
assent was always ready; and believing every evil
would yield to absence, she eagerly, and even with
happiness, set off.</P>
<P>When the rest of the party assembled without her,
Edgar, surprised, enquired if she were well? Miss
Margland answered, yes; but for the sake of what
she loved best in the world, a frolic, she was gone in
the chaise to Etherington. Edgar could not prevail
with himself to depart till he had spoken with her,
and privately deferred his purposed leave-taking till
noon.</P>
<P>During this report, Sir Hugh was anxiously en∣gaged
in some business he seemed to wish to conceal.
He spoke little, but nodded frequently to himself,
with an air of approving his own ideas; he sum∣moned
Jacob to him repeatedly, with whom he held
various whispering conferences; and desired Miss
Margland, who made the tea, not to pour it out
too fast, as he was in no hurry to have breakfast
over.</P>
<P>When nothing he could urge succeeded, in
making any of the company eat or drink any thing
more, he pulled Edgar by the sleeve; and, in an
eager but low voice, said, “My dear Mr. Edgar,
I have a great favour to beg of you, which is only
that you will do something to divert Dr. Ork∣borne.”</P>
<P>“I should be very happy, Sir,” cried Edgar,
smiling, “but I much doubt my capability.”</P>
<P>“Why, my dear Mr. Edgar, it's only to keep
him from finding out my new surprise till it's got
ready. And if you will but just spout out to him a
bit or two of Virgil and Horace, or some of those
Greek and Latin language-masters, he'll be in no
hurry to budge, I promise you.”</P>
<P>A request from Sir Hugh, who with the most
prompt alacrity met the wishes of every one, was
by Edgar held to be indisputable. He advanced,
therefore, to Dr. Orkborne, who was feeling for his
tablets, which he commonly examined in his way up
<PB N="249" REF="58"/>
the stairs, and started a doubt, of which he begged
an exposition, upon a passage of Virgil.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne willingly stopt, and displayed,
with no small satisfaction, an erudition, that did
him nearly as much honour in the ears of the igno∣rant
and admiring Sir Hugh, as in those of the culti∣vated
and well-judging Edgar. “Ah!” said the
Baronet, sighing, though addressing himself to no
one, “if I had but addicted myself to these studies
in due season, I might have understood all this too!
though now I can't for my life make out much sense
of what they're talking of; nor a little neither, in∣deed,
as to that; thanks to my own idleness; to
which, however, I am not much obliged.”</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the discussion soon led to some
points of comparison, that demanded a review of
various authors, and the Doctor proposed adjourning
to his own apartment. The Baronet winked at Ed∣gar,
who would have changed the discourse, or him∣self
have sought the books, or have been satisfied
without them; but Dr. Orkborne was as eager here,
as in other matters he was slow and phlegmatic;
and, regardless of all opposition, was making off,
when Sir Hugh, catching him by the arm, ex∣claimed,
“My good friend, I beg it as a particular
favour, you won't stir a step!”</P>
<P>“Not stir a step, Sir?” repeated the Doctor,
amazed.</P>
<P>“That is, not to your own room.”</P>
<P>“Not go to my own room, Sir?”</P>
<P>The Baronet gently begged him not to take it
amiss, and presently, upon the appearance of Jacob,
who entered with a significant smile, said, he would
keep him no longer.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne, to whom nothing was so irksome
as a moment's detention from his books and papers,
instantly departed, inviting Edgar to accompany
him; but without troubling himself to inquire for
what end he had been held back.</P>
<P>When they were gone, Sir Hugh, rubbing his
hands, said, “Well, I think this good gentleman
<PB N="250" REF="59"/>
won't go about the country again, with all his books
fastened about him, to shew he has no where to put
them: for as to his telling me he only took them to
look at, I am not quite such an ignoramus, with all
my ignorance, as to believe such a thing as that, es∣pecially
of a regular bred scholar.”</P>
<P>A loud and angry sound of voices from above here
interrupted the pleased harangue of the Baronet;
Miss Margland opened the door to listen, and, with
no small delight, heard words, scarce intelligible for
rage, breaking from Dr. Orkborne, whose anger,
while Edgar was endeavouring to moderate, Jacob
and Mary were vociferously resenting.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, all astonished, feared there was some
mistake. He had sent, the preceding day, as far as
Winchester, for two book-cases, which he had or∣dered
should arrive early, and be put up during the
breakfast; and he had directed Mary to place upon
the shelves, with great care, all the loose books and
papers she found dispersed about the room, as neatly
as possible: after which Jacob was to give notice
when all was arranged.</P>
<P>The words now “If I must have my manuscripts
rummaged at pleasure, by every dunce in the house,
I would rather lie in the street!” distinctly caught
their ears. Sir Hugh was thunderstruck with amaze∣ment
and disappointment, but said nothing. Miss
Margland looked all spight and pleasure, and Eu∣genia
all concern.</P>
<P>Louder yet, and with accents of encreasing as∣perity,
the Doctor next exclaimed “A twelvemonth's
hard labour will not repair this mischief! I should
have been much more obliged to you if you had
blown out my brains!”</P>
<P>The Baronet, aghast, cried, “Lord help us! I
think I had best go and get the shelves pulled down
again, what I have done not being meant to offend,
being what will cost me ten pounds and upwards.”</P>
<P>He then, though somewhat irresolute, whether or
not to proceed, moved towards the foot of the stairs;
but there a new storm of rage startled him. “I wish
you had been all of you annihilated ere ever you had
<PB N="251" REF="60"/>
entered my room! I had rather have lost my ears
than that manuscript! I wish with all my heart you
had been at the bottom of the sea, every one of you,
before you had touched it!”</P>
<P>“If you won't believe me, it can't be helped,”
said Mary; “but if I was to tell it you over and
over, I've done nothing to no mortal thing. I only
just swept the room after the carpenter was gone, for
it was all in such a pickle it was a shame to be seen.”</P>
<P>“You have ruined me!” cried he, “you have
swept it behind the fire, I make not a moment's
doubt; and I had rather you had given me a bowl of
poison! you can make me no reparation; it was a
clue to a whole section.”</P>
<P>“Well, I won't make no more words about it,”
said Mary, angrily; “but I'm sure I never so much
as touched it with a pair of tongs, for I never see it;
nor I don't so much as know it if I do.”</P>
<P>“Why, it's a piece of paper written all over;
look! just such another as this: I left it on the table,
by this corner—”</P>
<P>“O! that?” cried Mary; “yes, I remember
that.”</P>
<P>“Well, where is it? What have you done with
it?”</P>
<P>“Why, I happened of a little accident about
that;—for as I was a sweeping under the table, the
broom knocked the ink down; but, by good luck, it
only fell upon that little morsel of paper.”</P>
<P>“Little morsel of paper? it's more precious than
a whole library! But what did you do with it? what
is become of it? whatever condition it is in, if you
have but saved it—where is it, I say?”</P>
<P>“Why—it was all over ink, and good for nothing,
so I did not think of your missing it—so I throwed
it behind the fire.”</P>
<P>“I wish you had been thrown there yourself with
all my heart! But if ever you bring a broom into
my room again—”</P>
<P>“Why, I did nothing but what my master or∣dered—”</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="61"/>
“Or if you ever you touch a paper, or a book of
mine, again—”</P>
<P>“My master said himself—”</P>
<P>“Your master's a blockhead! and you are an∣other
—go away, I say!”</P>
<P>Mary now hurried out of the room, enraged for
her master, and frightened for herself; and Edgar,
not aware Sir Hugh was within hearing, soon suc∣ceeded
in calming the Doctor, by mildly listening
to his lamentations.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, extremely shocked, sat upon the stairs
to recover himself. Miss Margland, who never felt
so virtuous, and never so elated, as when witnessing
the imperfections or improprieties of others, des∣ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted
largely against ingratitude; treating an un∣meaning
sally of passion as a serious mark of tur∣pitude:
but Eugenia, ashamed for Dr. Orkborne,
to whom, as her preceptor, she felt a constant dis∣position
to be partial, determined to endeavour to
induce him to make some apology. She glided,
therefore, pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> her uncle, and tapped at the Doctor's
door.</P>
<P>Mary seeing her master so invitingly in her way,
could by no means resist her desire of appeal and
complaint; and, descending the stairs, begged his
honour to hear her.</P>
<P>“Mary,” said he, rising, and returning to the
parlour, “you need not tell me a word, for I have
heard it all myself; by which it may be truly said,
listeners never hear good of themselves; so I've got
the proper punishment; for which reason, I hope
you won't look upon it as an example.”</P>
<P>“I am sure, Sir,” said Mary, “if your honour
can excuse his speaking so disrespectful, it's what no∣body
else can; and if it was not for thinking as his
head's got a crack in it, there is not a servant among
us as would not affront him for it.”</P>
<P>The Baronet interrupted her with a serious lecture
upon the civility he expected for all his guests; and
she promised to restrain her wrath; “But only, Sir,”
she continued, “if your honour had seen the bit of
<PB N="253" REF="62"/>
paper as he made such a noise at me for, your honour
would not have believed it. Not a soul could have
read it. My Tom would ha' been well licked if he'd
wrote no better at school. And as to his being a
twelvemonth a scrawling such another, I'll no more
believe it than I'll fly. It's as great a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ib as ever was
told.”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh begged her to be quiet, and to think no
more of the matter.</P>
<P>“No, your honour, I hope I'm not a person as
bears malice; only I could not but speak of it, be∣cause
he behaves more comical every day. I thought
he'd ha' beat me over and over. And as to the
stories he tells about them little bits of paper, mortal
patience can't bear it no longer.”</P>
<P>The remonstrance of Eugenia took immediate ef∣fect.
Dr. Orkborne, shocked and alarmed at the
expression which had escaped him, protested himself
willing to make the humblest reparation, and truly
declared, he had been so greatly disturbed by the loss
he had just sustained, that he not merely did not
mean, but did not know what he had said.</P>
<P>Edgar was the bearer of this apology, which Sir
Hugh accepted with his usual good humour. “His
calling me a blockhead,” cried he, “is a thing I
have no right to resent, because I take it for granted,
he would not have said it, if he had not thought it;
and a man's thoughts are his castle, and ought to be
free.”</P>
<P>Edgar repeated the protestation, that he had been
hurried on by passion, and spoke without meaning.</P>
<P>“Why, then, my dear Mr. Edgar, I must fairly
own I don't see the great superiorness of learning, if
it can't keep a man's temper out of a passion. How∣ever,
say nothing of the sort to poor Clermont, upon
his coming over, who I expect won't speak one word
in ten I shall understand; which, however, as it's all
been done for the best, I would not have the poor boy
discouraged in.”</P>
<P>He then sent a kind message by Edgar to Dr. Ork∣borne,
desi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing him not to mind such a trifle.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="63"/>
This conciliating office was congenial to the dis∣position
of Edgar, and softened his impatience for
the return of Camilla, but when, soon after, a note
arrived from Mr. Tyrold, requesting Sir Hugh to
dispense with seeing him till the next day, and apo∣logising
for keeping his daughter, he felt equally dis∣appointed
and provoked, though he determined not
to delay any longer his departure. He gave orders,
therefore, for his horses immediately, and with all
the less <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gret, for knowing Camilla no longer in the
circle he was to quit.</P>
<P>The ladies were in the parlour with Sir Hugh,
who was sorrowfully brooding over his brother's note,
when he entered it to take leave. Addressing himself
somewhat rapidly to the Baronet, he told him he
was under an unpleasant necessity, to relinquish some
days of the month's sojourn intended for him. He
made acknowledgments full of regard for his kind∣ness
and hospitality? and then, only bowing to the
ladies, left the room, before the astonished Sir Hugh
comprehended he was going.</P>
<P>“Well,” Cried Miss Margland, “this is curious
indeed! <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e has flown off from every thing, without
even <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> apology!”</P>
<P>“I hope he is not really gone?” said Eugenia,
walking to the window.</P>
<P>“I'm sure I don't care what he does,” cried In∣diana,
“he's welcome to go or to stay. I'm grown
quite sick of him, for my part.”</P>
<P>“Gone?” said Sir Hugh, recovering breath;
“it's impossible! Why, he never has said one word
to me of the day, nor the settlements, nor all those
things!”</P>
<P>He then rang the bell, and sent to desire Mr. Man∣dlebert
might be called immediately.</P>
<P>Edgar, who was mounting his horse, obeyed with
some chagrin. As soon as he re-entered the room,
Sir Hugh cried; “My dear Mr. young Edgar, it's
something amazing to me you should think of going
away without coming to an explanation?”</P>
<P>“An explanation, Sir?”</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="64"/>
“Yes, don't you know what I mean?”</P>
<P>“Not in the least, Sir,” cried Edgar, staggered
by a doubt whether he suspected what he felt for Ca∣milla,
or referred to what was reported of Indiana.</P>
<P>“Why, then, my pretty dear,” said Sir Hugh
to Indiana, “you won't object, I hope, to taking
a little walk in the garden, provided it is not dis∣agreeable
to you; for you had better not hear what
we are going to talk about before your face.”</P>
<P>Indiana, pouting her beautiful under lip, and
scornfully passing Edgar, complied. Eugenia ac∣companied
her; but Miss Margland kept her ground.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, always unwilling to make any attack,
and at a loss how to begin, simply said; “Why, I
thought Mr. Mandlebert, you would stay with us
till next year?”</P>
<P>Edgar only bowed.</P>
<P>“Why, then, suppose you do?”</P>
<P>“Most probably, Sir, I shall by that time be upon
the Continent. If some particular circumstance does
not occur, I purpose shortly making the tour of
Europe.”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh now lost all guard and all restraint, and with
undisguised displeasure exclaimed; “So here's just
the second part of Clermont! at the moment I sent
for him home, thinking he would come to put the
finish to all my cares about Eugenia, he s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nds me
word he must travel!—And though the poor girl
took it very well, from knowing nothing of the mat∣ter,
I can't say I take it very kind of you, Mr.
young Edgar, to come and do just the same by In∣diana!”</P>
<P>The surprize of Edgar was unspeakable: that Sir
Hugh should wish the relation of Jacob, with respect
to Indiana, confirmed, he could not wonder; but
that his wishes should have amounted to expectations,
and that he should deem his niece ill used by their
failure, gave him the most poignant astonishment.</P>
<P>Miss Margland, taking advantage of his silent
consternation, began now to pour forth very vo∣lubly▪
the most pointed reflections upon the injury
<PB N="256" REF="65"/>
done to young ladies by reports of this nature, which
were always sure to keep off all other offers. There
was no end, she said, to the admirers who had de∣serted
Indiana in despair; and she questioned if she
would ever have any more, from the general belief
of her being actually pre-engaged.</P>
<P>Edgar, whose sense of honour was tenaciously de∣licate,
heard her with a mixture of concern for In∣diana,
and indignation against herself, that kept her
long uninterrupted; for though burning to assert the
integrity of his conduct, the fear of uttering a word
that might be offensive to Indiana, embarrassed and
checked him.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, who in seeing him overpowered, con∣cluded
he was relenting, now kindly took his hand,
and said: “My dear Mr. Mandlebert, if you are
sorry for what you were intending, of going away,
and leaving us all in the lurch, why, you shall never
hear a word more about it, for I will make friends
for you with Indiana, and beg of Miss Margland that
she'll do us the favour to say no more.”</P>
<P>Edgar, affectionately pressing the hand of the
Baronet, uttered the warmest expressions of personal
regard, and protested he should always think it an
honour to have been held worthy of pretending to
any alliance in his family; but he kuew not how the
present mistake had been made, or report had arisen:
he could boast of no partiality from Miss Lynmere,
nor had he ever addressed her with any particular
views: yet, as it was the opinion of Miss Margland,
that the rumour, however false, might prevent the
approach of some deserving object, he now finally
determined to become, for a while, a stranger at
Cleves, however painful such self-denial must prove.</P>
<P>He then precipitately left the room, and, in five
minutes, had galloped out of the Park.</P>
<P>The rest of the morning was spent by Sir Hugh
in the utmost discomposure; and by Miss Margland
in alternate abuse of Camilla and of Edgar; while
Indiana passed from a piqued and short disappoint∣ment,
<PB N="257" REF="66"/>
to the consolatory idea that Melmond might
now re-appear.</P>
<P>Edgar rode strait to Beech Park, where he busied
himself the whole day in viewing alterations and im∣provements;
but where nothing answered his ex∣pectations,
since Camilla had disappointed them.
That sun-beam, which had gilded the place to his
eyes, was now overclouded, and the first possession of
his own domain, was his first day of discontent.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="29" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Maternal Eye.</HEAD>
<P>THE vivacity with which Camilla quitted Cleves,
was sunk before she reached Etherington. She had
quitted also Edgar, quitted him offended, and in
doubt if it might ever be right she should vindicate
herself in his opinion. Yet all seemed strange and
unintelligible that regarded the asserted nuptials: his
indifference was palpable; she believed him to have
been unaccountably drawn in, and her heart softly
whispered, it was herself he preferred.</P>
<P>From this soothing but dangerous idea, she
struggled to turn her thoughts. She anticipated the
remorse of holding the affections of the husband of
her cousin, and determined to use every possible me∣thod
to forget him—unless, which she strove vainly
not to hope, the reported alliance should never take
place.</P>
<P>These reflections so completely engrossed her the
whole way, that she arrived at the Parsonage House,
without the smallest mental preparation how to ac∣count
for her return, or how to plead for remaining
at Etherington. Foresight, the offspring of judg∣ment,
or the disciple of Experience, made no part
of the character of Camilla, whose impetuous dis∣position
was open to every danger of indiscretion,
<PB N="258" REF="67"/>
though her genuine love of virtue glowed warm with
juvenile ardour.</P>
<P>She entered, therefore, the breakfast parlour in a
state of sudden perplexity what to say; Mr. Tyrold
was alone and writing. He looked surprized, but
embraced her with his accustomed affection, and en∣quired
to what he owed her present sight.</P>
<P>She made no answer; but embraced him again,
and enquired after her mother.</P>
<P>“She is well,” he replied: “but, tell me, is
your uncle impatient of my delay? It has been wholly
unavoidable. I have been deeply engaged; and
deeply chagrined. Your poor mother would be still
more disturbed, if the nobleness of her mind did not
support her.”</P>
<P>Camilla, extremely grieved, earnestly enquired
what had happened.</P>
<P>He then informed her that Mrs. Tyrold, the very
next morning, must abruptly quit them all and set
out for Lisbon to her sick brother, Mr. Relvil.</P>
<P>“Is he so much worse?”</P>
<P>“No: I even hope he is better. An act of folly
has brought this to bear. Do not now desire par∣ticulars.
I will finish my letter, and then return
with you for a few minutes to Cleves. The carriage
must wait.”</P>
<P>“Suffer me first to ask, does Lavinia go with my
mother?”</P>
<P>“No, she can only take old Ambrose. Lavinia
must supply her place at home.”</P>
<P>“Ah! my dearest father, and may not I, too,
stay with you and assist her?”</P>
<P>“If my brother will spare you, my dear child,
there is nothing can so much contribute to wile away
to me your mother's absence.”</P>
<P>Enchanted thus, without an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> explanation, to have
gained her point, she completely revived; though
when Mrs. Tyrold, whom she almost worshipped, en∣tered
the room, in all the hurry of preparing for her
long journey, she shed a torrent of tears in her arms.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="68"/>
“This good girl,” said Mr. Tyrold, “is herself
desirous to quit the present gaities of Cleves, to try
to enliven my solitude till we all may meet again.”</P>
<P>The conscious and artless Camilla could not bear
this undeserved praise. She quitted her mother, and
returning to Mr. Tyrold, “O my father!” she
cried, “if you will take me again under your beloved
roof, it is for my sake—not your's—I beg to re∣turn!”</P>
<P>“She is right,” said Mrs. Tyrold; “there is no
merit in having an heart; she could have none, if to
be with you were not her first gratification.”</P>
<P>“Yes, indeed, my dear mother, it would always
be so, even if no other inducement—.” She stopt
short, confused.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, who continued writing, did not heed
this little blunder; but his wife, whose quickness of
apprehension and depth of observation, were always
alive, even in the midst of business, cares, and other
attentions, turned hastily to her daughter, and asked
to what “other inducement” she alluded.</P>
<P>Camilla, distressed, hung her head, and would
have forborne making any answer.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold, then, putting down various packet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
which she was sorting and selecting, came suddenly
up to her, and taking both her hands, looked ear∣nestly
in her face, saying: “My Camilla! something
has disquieted you?—your countenance is not itself.
Tell me, my dear girl, what brought you hither this
morning? and what is it you mean by some other
inducement?”</P>
<P>“Do not ask me now, my dearest mother,” an∣swered
she, in a faultering voice; “when you come
back again, no doubt all will be over; and then—”</P>
<P>“And is that the time, Camilla, to speak to your
best friends? would it not be more judicious to be
explicit with them, while what affects you is still de∣pending?”</P>
<P>Camilla, hiding her face on her mother's bosom,
burst afresh into tears.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="69"/>
“Alas!” cried Mrs. Tyrold, “what new evil is
hovering? If it must invade me again through one
of my children, tell me, at least, Camilla, it is not
wilfully that you, too, afflict me? and afflict the
best of fathers?”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, dropping his pen, looked at them
both with the most apprehensive anxiety.</P>
<P>“No, my dearest mother,” said Camilla, endea∣vouring
to meet her eyes; “not wilfully,—but some∣thing
has happened—I can hardly myself tell how or
what—but indeed Cleves, now—” she hesitated.</P>
<P>“How is my brother?” demanded Mr. Tyrold.</P>
<P>“O! all that is good and kind! and I grieve to
quit him—but, indeed, Cleves, now—” Again she
hesitated.</P>
<P>“Ah, my dear child!” said Mrs. Tyrold, “I
always feared that residence!—you are too young,
too inconsiderate, too innocent, indeed, to be left so
utterly to yourself.—Forgive me, my dear Mr. Ty∣rold;
I do not mean to reflect upon your brother,
but he is not <HI>you!</HI>—and with you alone, this dear
inexperienced girl can be secure from all harm. Tell
me, however, what it is—?”</P>
<P>Camilla, in the extremest confusion changed co∣lour,
but tried vainly to speak. Mr. Tyrold, sus∣pended
from all employment, waited fearfully some
explanation.</P>
<P>“We have no time,” said Mrs. Tyrold, “for de∣lay;—
you know I am going abroad,—and cannot
ascertain my return; though all my heart left be∣hind
me, with my children and their father, will urge
every acceleration in my power.”</P>
<P>Camilla wept again, fondly folding her arms round
her mother; “I had hoped,” she cried, “that I
should have come home to peace, comfort, tran∣quillity!
to both of you, my dearest father and mo∣ther,
and to all my unbroken happiness under your
roof!—How little did I dream of so cruel a separa∣tion!”</P>
<P>“Console yourself, my Camilla, that you have
not been its cause; may Heaven ever spare me evil
<PB N="261" REF="70"/>
in your shape at least!—you say it is nothing wilful?
I can bear every thing else.”</P>
<P>“We will not,” said Mr. Tyrold, “press her;
she will tell us all in her own way, and at her own
time. Forced confidence is neither fair nor flatter∣ing.
I will excuse her return to my brother, and
she will the sooner be able to give her account for
finding herself not hurried.”</P>
<P>“Calm yourself, then,” said Mrs. Tyrold, “as
your indulgent father permits, and I will proceed
with my preparations.”</P>
<P>Camilla now, somewhat recovering, declared she
had almost nothing to say; but her mother conti∣nued
packing up, and her father went on with his
letter.</P>
<P>She had now time to consider that her own fears
and emotion were involving her in unnecessary con∣fessions;
she resolved, therefore, to repress the ful∣ness
of her heart, and to acknowledge only the ac∣cusation
of Miss Margland. And in a few minutes,
without waiting for further enquiry, she gathered
courage to open upon the subject; and with as much
ease and quietness as she could command, related, in
general terms, the charge brought against her, and
her consequent desire to quit Cleves, “till,—till
—” Here she stopt for breath. Mr. Tyrold in∣stantly
finished the sentence, “till the marriage has
taken place?”</P>
<P>She coloured, and faintly uttered, “Yes.”</P>
<P>“You are right, my child,” said he, “and you
have acted with a prudence which does you honour.
Neither the ablest reasoning, nor the most upright
conduct, can so completely obliterate a surmise of
this nature, from a suspicious mind, as absence.
You shall remain, therefore, with me, till your
cousin is settled in her new habitation. Do you
know if the day is fixed?”</P>
<P>“No, Sir,” she answered, while the roses fled
her cheeks at a question which implied so firm a be∣lief
of the union.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="71"/>
“Do not suffer this affair to occasion you any
further uneasiness,” he continued; “it is the in∣herent
and unalienable compact of Innocence with
Truth, to hold themselves immovably superior to the
calumny of false imputations. But I will go myself
to Cleves, and set this whole matter right.”</P>
<P>“And will you, too, Sir, have the goodness—”
She was going to say, <HI>to make my peace with Edgar;</HI>
but the fear of misinterpretation checked her, and
she turned away.</P>
<P>He gently enquired what she meant; she avoided
any explanation, and he resumed his writing.</P>
<P>Ah me! thought she, will the time ever come,
when with openness, with propriety, I may clear
myself of caprice to Edgar?</P>
<P>Less patient, because more alarmed than her hus∣band,
Mrs. Tyrold followed her to the window.
She saw a tear in her eye, and again she took both
her hands: “Have you, my Camilla,” she cried,
“have you told us all? Can unjust impertinence so
greatly have disturbed you? Is there no sting be∣longing
to this wound that you are covering from
our sight, though it may precisely be the spot that
calls most for some healing balm?”</P>
<P>Again the cheeks of Camilla received their fugi∣tive
roses. “My dearest mother,” she cried, “is
not this enough?—to be accused—suspected—and to
fear—”</P>
<P>She stammered, and would have withdrawn her
hands; but Mrs. Tyrold, still holding them, said,
“To fear what? speak out, my best child! open
to us your whole heart!—Where else will you find
repositories so tender?”</P>
<P>Tears again flowed down the burning cheeks of
Camilla, and dropping her eyes, “Ah, my mo∣ther!”
she cried, “you will think me so frivolous—
you will blush so for your daughter—if I own—if I
dare confess—”</P>
<P>Again she stopped, terrified at the conjectures to
which this opening might give birth; but when fur∣ther
and fondly pressed by her mother, she added,
<PB N="263" REF="72"/>
“It is not alone these unjust surmises,—nor even
Indiana's unkind concurrence in them—but also—I
have been afraid—I must have made a strange—a
capricious—an ungrateful appearance in the eyes of
Edgar Mandlebert.”</P>
<P>Here her voice dropt; but presently recovering,
she rapidly continued, “I know it is very immate∣rial—
and I am sensible how foolish it may sound—
but I shall also think of it no more now,—and
therefore, as I have told the whole—”</P>
<P>She looked up, conscience struck at these last
words, to see if they proved satisfactory: she
caught, in the countenance of her mother, an ex∣pression
of deep commiseration, which was followed
by a thousand maternal caresses of unusual softness,
though unaccompanied by any words.</P>
<P>Penetrated, yet distressed, she gratefully received
them, but rejoiced when, at length, Mr. Tyrold,
rising, said, “Go, my love, up stairs to your sister;
your mother, else, will never proceed with her
business.”</P>
<P>She gladly ran off, and soon, by a concise narra∣tion,
satisfied Lavinia, and then calmed her own
troubled mind.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold now, though evidently much affected
himself, strove to compose his wife. “Alas!” cried
she, “do you not see what thus has touched me?
Do you not perceive that our lovely girl, more just
to his worth than its possessor, has given her whole
heart to Edgar Mandlebert?”</P>
<P>“I perceived it through your emotion, but I had
not discovered it myself. I grieve, now, that the
probability of such an event had not struck me in
time to have kept them apart for its prevention.”</P>
<P>“I grieve for nothing,” cried she, warmly,
“but the infatuated blindness of that self-lost young
man. What a wife would Camilla have made him in
every stage of their united career! And how unfor∣tunately
has she sympathised in my sentiments, that
he alone seemed worthy to replace the first and best
protector she must relinquish when she quits this
<PB N="264" REF="73"/>
house! What will he find in Indiana but a beautiful
doll, uninterested in his feelings, unmoved by his ex∣cellencies,
and incapable of comprehending him if
he speaks either of business or literature!”</P>
<P>“Yet many wives of this description,” replied
Mr. Tyrold, “are more pleasing in the eyes of their
husbands than women who are either better informed
in intellect, or more alive in sensation; and it is not
an uncommon idea amongst men, that where, both
in temper and affairs, there is least participation,
there is most repose. But this is not the case with
Edgar.”</P>
<P>“No! he has a nobler resemblance than this por∣trait
would allow him; a resemblance which made
me hope from him a far higher style of choice. He
prepares himself, however, his own ample punish∣ment;
for he has too much understanding not to
sicken of mere personal allurements, and too much
generosity to be flattered, or satisfied, by mere pas∣sive
intellectual inferiority. Neither a mistress nor a
slave can make him happy; a companion is what he
requires; and for that, in a very few months, how
vainly his secret soul may sigh, and <HI>think of our
Camilla!</HI>”</P>
<P>They then settled, that it would be now essential
to the peace of their child to keep her as much as
possible from his sight; and determined not to send
her back to Cleves to apologize for the new plan,
but to take upon themselves that whole charge.
“Her nature,” said Mrs. Tyrold, “is so gay, so
prompt for happiness, that I have little fear but in
absence she will soon cease to dwell upon him. Fear,
indeed, I have, but it is of a deeper evil than this
early impression; I fear for her future lot! With
whom can we trust her?—She will not endure negli∣gence;
and those she cannot respect she will soon
despise. What a pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pect for her, then, with our
present race of young men! their frivolous fickleness
nauseates whatever they can reach; they have a weak
shame of asserting, or even listening to what is right,
and a shallow pride in professing and performing
<PB N="265" REF="74"/>
what is wrong. How must this ingenuous girl for∣get
all she has yet seen, heard, or felt, ere she can
encounter wickedness, or even weakness, and dis∣guise
her abhorrence or contempt?”</P>
<P>“My dear Georgiana, let us never look forward
to evil.”</P>
<P>“Will it not be doubly hard to bear, if it come
upon us without preparation?”</P>
<P>“I think not. Terror shakes, and apprehension
depresses: hope nerves as well as gladdens us. Re∣member
always, I do not by hope mean presump∣tion;
I mean simply a chearful trust in heaven.”</P>
<P>“I must always yield,” cried Mrs. Tyrold, “to
your superior wisdom, and reflecting piety; and if I
cannot conquer my fears, at least I will neither
court nor indulge them.”</P>
<P>The thanks of a grateful husband repaid this
compliance. They sent for Camilla, to acquaint her
they would make her excuses at Cleves: she gave a
ready though melancholy consent, and the virtue of
her motives drew tears from her idolizing mother, as
she clasped her to her heart.</P>
<P>They then set out together, that Mr. Tyrold
might arrange this business with Sir Hugh, of whom
and of Eugenia Mrs. Tyrold was to take leave.</P>

<P>CAMILLA now felt more permanently revived,
because better satisfied with the rectitude of her
conduct. She could no longer be accused of inter∣fering
between Edgar and Indiana; that affair
would take its natural course, and, be it what it
might, while absent from both parties, she concluded
she should at least escape all censure.</P>
<P>Peaceably, therefore, she returned to take posses∣sion
of her usual apartment, affectionately accom∣panied
by her eldest sister.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="75"/>
The form and the mind of Lavinia were in the
most perfect harmony. Her polished complexion
was fair, clear, and transparent; her features were
of the extremest delicacy, her eyes of the softest
blue, and her smile displayed internal serenity. The
unrussled sweetness of her disposition bore the same
character of modest excellence. Joy, hope, and
prosperity, sickness, sorrow, and disappointment,
assailed alike in vain the uniform gentleness of her
temper: yet though thus exempt from all natural
turbulence, either of pleasure or of pain, the meek∣ness
of her composition degenerated not into insen∣sibility;
it was open to all the feminine feelings of
pity, of sympathy, and of tenderness.</P>
<P>Thus copiously gifted with “all her sex's soft∣ness,”
her society would have contributed to restore
Camilla to repose, had they continued together
without interruption; but, in a few minutes, the
room door was opened, and Lionel, rushing into the
apartment, called out, “How do, do, my girls?
how do, do?” and shook them each by the hand,
with a swing that nearly brought them to the
ground.</P>
<P>Camilla always rejoiced at his sight; but La∣vinia
gravely said, “I thought, brother, you had
been at Dr. Marchmont's?”</P>
<P>“All in good time, my dear! I shall certainly
visit the old gentleman before long.”</P>
<P>“Did you not sleep there, then, last night?”</P>
<P>“No, child.”</P>
<P>“Good God, Lionel!—if my mother—”</P>
<P>“My dear little Lavinia,” cried he, chucking
her under the chin, “I have a vast notion of making
visits at my own time, instead of my mamma's.”</P>
<P>“O Lionel! and can you, just now—”</P>
<P>“Come, come,” interrupted he, “don't let us
waste our precious minutes in old moralizing. If I
had not luckily been hard by, I should not have
known the coast was clear. Pray where are they
gone, tantivying?”</P>
<P>“To Cleves.”</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="76"/>
“To Cleves! what a happy escape! I was upon
the point of going thither myself. Camilla, what
is the matter with thee?”</P>
<P>“Nothing—I am only thinking—pray when do
you go to Oxford?”</P>
<P>“Pho, pho,—what do you talk of Oxford for?
you are grown quite stupid, girl. I believe you
have lived too long with Miss Margland. Pray how
does that dear creature do? I am afraid she will
grow melancholy from not seeing me so long. Is
she as pretty as she used to be? I have some notion
of sending her a suitor.”</P>
<P>“O brother,” said Lavinia, “is it possible you
can have such spirits?”</P>
<P>“O hang it, if one is not merry when one can,
what is the world good for? besides, I do assure
you, I fretted so consumed hard at first, that for the
life of me I can fret no longer.”</P>
<P>“But why are you not at Dr. Marchmont's?”</P>
<P>“Because, my dear, you have no conception the
pleasure those old doctors take in lecturing a young∣ster
who is in any disgrace.”</P>
<P>“Disgrace!” repeated Camilla.</P>
<P>“At all events,” said Lavinia, “I beseech you
to be a little careful; I would not have my poor mo∣ther
find you here for the world.”</P>
<P>“O, as to that, I defy her to desire the meeting
less than I do. But come, let's talk of something
else. How go on the classics? Is my old friend, Dr.
Orkborne, as chatty and amusing as ever?”</P>
<P>“My dear Lionel,” said Camilla. “I am filled
with apprehension and perplexity. Why should my
mother wish not to see you? And why—and how is
it possible you can wish not to see her?”</P>
<P>“What, don't you know it all?”</P>
<P>“I know only that something must be wrong;
but how, what, or which way, I have not heard.”</P>
<P>“Has not Lavinia told you, then?”</P>
<P>“No,” answered Lavinia; “I could be in no
haste to give her pain.”</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="77"/>
“You are a good girl enough. But how came
you hither, Camilla? and what is the reason you
have not seen my mother yourself?”</P>
<P>“Not seen her! I have been with her this half
hour.”</P>
<P>“What! and in all that time did not she tell
you?”</P>
<P>“She did not name you.”</P>
<P>“Is it possible!—Well, she's a noble creature!
I wonder how she could ever have such a son as me.
And I am still less like my father than her. I sup∣pose
I was changed in the cradle. Will you coun∣tenance
me, young ladies, if some villainous attor∣ney
or exciseman should by and by come to own me?”</P>
<P>“Dear Lionel,” cried Camilla, “do explain to
me what has happened. You make me think it im∣portant
and trifling twenty times in a minute.”</P>
<P>“O, a horrid business!—Lavinia must tell it
you. I'll go away till she has done. Don't despise
me, Camilla; I am confounded sorry, I promise
you.”</P>
<P>He then hurried out of the room, evidently feel∣ing
more emotion than he cared to display.</P>
<P>Yet Lavinia had but just begun her relation, when
he abruptly returned. “Come, I had better tell it
you myself,” cried he, “for she'll make such a dis∣mal
ditty of it, that it won't be over this half year;
the sooner we have done with it the better; it will
only put you out of spirits.”</P>
<P>Then, sitting down, and taking her hand, he
began, “You must know I was in rather a bad scrape
at Oxford last year—”</P>
<P>“Last year! and you never told us of it before!”</P>
<P>“O, 'twas about something you would not un∣derstand,
so I shall not mention particulars now. It
is enough for you to know that two or three of us
wanted a little cash!—well, so—in short, I sent a
letter—somewhat of a threatening sort—to poor old
uncle Relvil!”—</P>
<P>“O Lionel!”</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="78"/>
“O, I did not sign it,—it was only begging a
little money, which he can afford to spare very well;
and just telling him, if he did not come to a place I
mentioned, he would have his brains blown out.”—</P>
<P>“How horrible!”</P>
<P>“Pho, pho,—he had only to send the money,
you know, and then his brains might keep their
place; besides, you can't suppose there was gun∣powder
in the words. So I got this copied, and
took the proper measures for concealment, and,—
would you believe it! the poor old gull was fool
enough actually to send the money where he was
bid?”</P>
<P>“Fie, Lionel!” cried Lavinia; “do you call
him a fool because you terrified him?”</P>
<P>“Yes, to be sure, my dear; and you both think
him so too, only you don't hold it pretty to say so.
Do you suppose, if he had had half the wit of his
sister, he would have done it? I believe, in my con∣science,
there was some odd mistake in their births,
and that my mother took away the brains of the
man, and left the woman's for the noddle of my
poor uncle.”</P>
<P>“Fie, fie, brother!” said Lavinia again; “you
know how sickly he has always been from his birth,
and how soon therefore he might be alarmed.”</P>
<P>“Why, yes, Lavinia—I believe it was a very
bad thing—and I would give half my little singer I
had not done it. But it's over, you know; so what
signifies making the worst of it?”</P>
<P>“And did he not discover you?”</P>
<P>“No; I gave him particular orders, in my letter,
not to attempt any thing of that sort, assuring him
there were spies about him to watch his proceed∣ings.
The good old ass took it all for gospel. So
there the matter dropt. However, as ill luck would
have it, about three months ago we wanted another
sum—”</P>
<P>“And could you again—”</P>
<P>“Why, my dear, it was only taking a little of
my own fortune before-hand, for I am his heir; so
<PB N="270" REF="79"/>
we all agreed it was merely robbing myself; for we
had several consultations about it, and one of us is
to be a lawyer.”</P>
<P>“But you give me some pleasure here,” said Ca∣milla;
“for I had never heard that my uncle had
made you his heir.”</P>
<P>“No more have I neither, my dear; but I take
it for granted. Besides, our little lawyer put it into
my head. Well, we wrote again, and told the poor
old gentleman—for which I assure you I am heartily
repentant—that if he did not send me double the
sum, in the same manner, without delay, his house
was to be burnt to the ground the first night that he
and all his family were asleep in bed.—Now don't
make faces and shruggings, for, I promise you, I
think already I deserve to be hanged for giving him
the fright; though I would not really have hurt
him, all the time, for half his fortune. And who
could have guessed he would have bit so easily? The
money, however, came, and we thought it all se∣cure,
and agreed to get the same sum annually.”</P>
<P>“Annually!” repeated Camilla, with uplifted
hands.</P>
<P>“Yes, my dear. You have no conception how
convenient it would have been for our extra ex∣pences.
But, unluckily, uncle grew worse, and
went abroad, and then consulted with some crab of
a friend, and that friend with some demagogue of a
magistrate, and so all is blown!—However, we had
managed it so cleverly, it cost them near three
months to find it out, owing, I must confess, to
poor uncle's cowardice in not making his enquiries
before the money was carried off, and he himself
over the seas and far away. The other particulars
Lavinia must give you; for I have talked of it now
till I have made myself quite fick. Do tell me
something diverting to drive it a little out of my
head. Have you seen any thing of my enchanting
widow lately?”</P>
<P>“No, she does not desire to be seen by me. She
would not admit me.”</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="80"/>
“She is frankness itself, and does not pretend to
care a fig for any of her own sex.—O, but, Camilla,
I have wanted to ask you this great while, if you
think there is any truth in this rumour, that Mandle∣bert
intends to propose to Indiana?”</P>
<P>“To propose! I thought it had all long since
been settled.”</P>
<P>“Ay, so the world says; but I don't believe a
word of it. Do you think, if that were the case,
he would not have owned it to me? There's nothing
fixed yet, depend upon it.”</P>
<P>Camilla, struck, amazed, and delighted, invo∣luntarily
embraced her brother; though, recollect∣ing
herself almost at the same moment, she endea∣voured
to turn off the resistless impulse into taking
leave, and hurrying him away.</P>
<P>Lionel, who to want of solidity and penetration
principally owed the errors of his conduct, was easily
put upon a wrong seent, and assured her he would
take care to be off in time. “But what,” cried he,
“has carried them to Cleves? Are they gone to tell
tales? Because I have lost one uncle by my own
fault, must I lose another by their's?”</P>
<P>“No,” answered Lavinia, “they have deter∣mined
not to name you. They have settled that my
uncle Hugh shall never be told of the affair, nor any
body else, if they can help it, except your sisters,
and Dr. Marchmont.”</P>
<P>“Well, they are good souls,” cried he, at∣tempting
to laugh, though his eyes were glistening;
“I wish I deserved them better; I wish, too, it
was not so dull to be good. I can be merry and
harmless here at the same time,—and so I can at
Cleves;—but at Oxford—or in London,—your
merry blades there—I can't deny it, my dear sisters
—your merry blades there are but sad fellows. Yet
there is such fun, such spirit, such sport amongst
them, I cannot for my life keep out of their way.
Besides, you have no conception, young ladies, what
a bye-word you become among them if they catch
you flinching.”</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="81"/>
“I would not for the world say any thing to pain
you, my dear brother,” cried Lavinia; “but yet I
must hope that, in future, your first study will be to
resist such dangerous examples, and to drop such un∣worthy
friends?”</P>
<P>“If it is not to tell tales, then, for what else are
they gone to Cleves, just at this time?”</P>
<P>“For my mother to take leave of Eugenia and
my uncle before her journey.”</P>
<P>“Journey! Why, whither i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> she going!”</P>
<P>“Abroad.”</P>
<P>“The deuce she is!—And what for?”</P>
<P>“To try to make your peace with her brother;
or at least to nurse him herself till he is tolerably re∣covered.”</P>
<P>Lionel flapped his hat over his eyes, and saying,
“This is too much!—if I were a man I should shoot
myself!”—rushed out of the room.</P>
<P>The two sisters rapidly followed him, and caught
his arm before he could quit the house. They ear∣nestly
besought him to return, to compose himself,
and to promise he would commit no rash action.</P>
<P>“My dear sisters,” cried he, “I am worked just
now only as I ought to be; but I will give you any
promise you please. However, though I have never
listened to my father as I ought to have listened, he
has implanted in my mind a horror of suicide, that
will make me live my natural life, be it as good for
nothing as it may.”</P>
<P>He then suffered his sisters to lead him back to
their room, where he cast himself upon a chair, in
painful rumination upon his own unworthiness, and
his parents excellence; but the tender soothings of
Lavinia and Camilla, who trembled lest his remorse
should urge him to some act of violence, soon drew
him from reflections of which he hated the intrusion:
and he attended, with complacency, to their youth∣ful
security of perfect reconciliations, and re-esta∣blished
happiness.</P>
<P>With reciprocal exultation, the eyes of the sisters
congratulated each other on having saved him from
<PB N="273" REF="82"/>
despair: and seeing him now calm, and, they hoped,
safe, they mutually, though tacitly, agreed to ob∣trude
no further upon meditations that might be use∣ful
to him, and remained silently by his side.</P>
<P>For some minutes all were profoundly still; Lionel
then suddenly started up; the sisters, affrighted, has∣tily
arose at the same instant; when stretching him∣self
and yawning, he called out, “Pr'ythee, Ca∣milla,
what is become of that smug Mr. Dubster?”</P>
<P>Speechless with amazement, they looked earnestly
in his face, and feared he was raving.</P>
<P>They were soon, however undeceived; the tide
of penitence and sorrow was turned in his buoyant
spirits, and he was only restored to his natural vo∣latile
self.</P>
<P>“You used him most shabbily,” he continued,
“and he was a very pretty fellow. The next time
I have nothing better to do, I'll send him to you,
that you may make it up.”</P>
<P>This quick return of gaiety caused a sigh to La∣vinia,
and much surprise to Camilla; but neither of
them could prevail with him to depart, till Mr. and
Mrs. Tyrold were every moment expected; they then,
though with infinite difficulty, procured his promise
that he would go straight to Dr. Marchmont, ac∣cording
to an arrangement made for that purpose by
Mrs. Tyrold herself.</P>
<P>Lavinia, when he was gone, related some circum∣stances
of this affair which he had omitted. Mr.
Relvil, the elder brother of Mrs. Tyrold, was a
country gentleman of some fortune, but of weak
parts, and an invalid from his infancy. He had suf∣fered
these incendiary letters to prey upon his repose,
without venturing to produce them to any one, from
a terror of the menaces hurled against him by the
writer, till at length he became so completely hypo∣chondriac,
that his rest was utterly broken, and, to
preserve his very existence, he resolved upon visiting
another climate.</P>
<P>The day that he set out for Lisbon, his destined
harbour, he delivered his anonymous letters to a
<PB N="274" REF="83"/>
friend, to whom he left in charge to discover, if
possible, their author.</P>
<P>This discovery, by the usual means of enquiries
and rewards, was soon made; but the moment Mr.
Relvil learnt that the culprit was his nephew, he
wrote over to Mrs. Tyrold a statement of the trans∣action,
declaring he should disinherit Lionel from
every shilling of his estate. His health was so much
impaired, he said, by the disturbance this had given
to his mind, that he should be obliged to spend the
ensuing year in Portugal; and he even felt uncertain
if he might ever return to his own country.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold, astonished and indignant, severely
questioned her son, who, covered with shame, sur∣prise,
and repentance, confessed his guilt. Shocked
and grieved in the extreme, she ordered him from her
sight, and wrote to Dr. Marchmont to receive him.
She then settled with Mr. Tyrold the plan of her
journey and voyage, hoping by so immediately fol∣lowing,
and herself nursing her incensed brother,
to soften his wrath, and avert its final ill conse∣quences.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A few Embarrassments.</HEAD>
<P>MR. and Mrs. Tyrold returned to Etherington
somewhat relieved in their spirits, though perplexed
in their opinions. They had heard from Sir Hugh,
that Edgar had decidedly disavowed any pretensions
to Indiana, and had voluntarily retreated from Cleves,
that his disavowal might risk no misconstruction,
either in the family or the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>This insensibility to beauty the most exquisite
wanted no advocate with Mrs. Tyrold. Once more
she conceived some hope of what she wished, and she
<PB N="275" REF="84"/>
determined upon seeing Edgar before her departure.
The displeasure she had nourished against him va∣nished,
and justice to his general worth, with an af∣fection
nearly maternal to his person, took again
their wonted place in her bosom, and made her d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em
herself unkind in having purposed to quit the king∣dom
without bidding him farewel.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, whom professional duty and native
inclination alike made a man of peace, was ever
happy to second all conciliatory measures, and the
first to propose them, where his voice had any
chance of being heard. He sent a note, there∣fore,
to invite Edgar to call the next morning;
and Mrs. Tyrold deferred her hour of setting off till
noon.</P>
<P>Her own natural and immediate impulse, had been
to carry Camilla with her abroad; but when she
considered that her sole errand was to nurse and ap∣pease
an offended sick man, whose chamber she meant
not to quit till she returned to her family, she gave∣up
the pleasure she would herself have found in the
scheme, to her fears for the health and spirits of her
darling child, joined to the superior joy of leaving
such a solace with her husband.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh had heard the petition for postponing▪
the further visit of Camilla almost with despondence;
but Mr. Tyrold restored him completely to confidence,
with respect to his doubts concerning Dr. Orkborne,
with whom he held a long and satisfactory conversa∣tion;
and his own benevolent heart received a sen∣sible
pleasure, when, upon examining Indiana with
regard to Edgar, he found her, though piqued and
pouted, untouched either in affection or happiness.</P>
<P>Early the next morning Edgar came. Mrs. Ty∣rold
had taken measures for employing Camilla up
stairs, where she did not even hear that he entered
the house.</P>
<P>He was received with kindness, and told of the
sudden journey, though not of its motives. He
heard of it with unfeigned concern, and earnestly
<PB N="276" REF="85"/>
solicited to be the companion of the voyage, if no
better male protector were appointed.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold folded his arms around him at this
grateful proposal, while his wife, animated off her
guard, warmly exclaimed—“My dear, excellent
Edgar! you are indeed the model, the true son of
your guardian!”</P>
<P>Sorry for what had escaped her, from her internal
reference to Lionel, she looked anxiously to see if he
comprehended her; but the mantling blood which
mounted quick into his cheeks, while his eyes sought
the ground, soon told her there was another mode of
affinity, which at that moment had struck him.</P>
<P>Willing to establish whether this idea were right,
she now considered how she might name Camilla;
but her husband, who for no possible purpose could
witness distress without seeking to alleviate it, de∣clined
his kind offer, and began a discourse upon the
passage to Lisbon.</P>
<P>This gave Edgar time to recover, and in a few
seconds, something of moment seemed abruptly to oc∣cur
to him, and scarcely saying adieu, he hurried to
remount his horse.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold was perplexed; but she could take
no steps towards an explanation, without infringing
the delicacy she felt due to her daughter: she suffered
him, therefore, to depart.</P>
<P>She then proceeded with her preparations, which
entirely occupied her till the chaise was at the gate;
when, as the little party, their eyes and their hearts
all full, were taking a last farewel, the parlour door
was hastily opened, and Dr. Marchmont and Edgar
entered the room.</P>
<P>All were surprised, but none so much as Camilla,
who, forgetting, in sudden emotion, every thing but
former kindness and intimacy, delightedly exclaimed—
“Edgar! O how happy, my dearest mother!—I
was afraid you would go without seeing him!”</P>
<P>Edgar turned to her with a quickness that could
only be exceeded by his pleasure; her voice, her
manner, her unlooked-for interest in his appearance,
<PB N="277" REF="86"/>
penetrated to his very soul. “Is it possible,” he
cried, “you could have the goodness to wish me
this gratification? At a moment such as this, could
you—?” think of me, he would have added; but
Dr. Marchmont, coming forward, begged him to
account for their intrusion.</P>
<P>Almost overpowered by his own sudden emotion,
he could scarce recollect its motive himself; while
Camilla, fearful and repentant that she had broken
her deliberate and well-principled resolutions, re∣treated
to the window.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold witnessed the involuntary
movements which betrayed their mutual regard with
the tenderest satisfaction; and the complacency of
their attention, when Edgar advanced to them, soon
removed his embarrassment.</P>
<P>He then briefly acquainted them, that finding
Mrs. Tyrold would not accept him for her chevalier,
he had ridden ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to the parsonage of Cleves, whence
he hoped he had brought her one too unexception∣able
for rejection.</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont, with great warmth, then made
a proffer of his services, declaring he had long de∣sired
an opportunity to visit Portugal; and protesting
that, besides the pleasure of complying with any
wish of Mr. Mandlebert's, it would give him the
most serious happiness to shew his gratitude for the
many kind offices he owed to Mr. Tyrold, and his
high personal respect for his lady; he should require
but one day for his preparations, and for securing
the performance of the church duty at Cleves during
his absence.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold were equally struck by the
goodness of Dr. Marchmont, and the attentive kind∣ness
of Edgar. Mrs. Tyrold, nevertheless, would
immediately have declined the scheme; but her hus∣band
interposed. Her travelling, he said, with such
a guard, would be as conducive to his peace at home,
as to her safety abroad. “And with respect,” cried
he, “to obligation, I hold it as much a moral duty
not to refuse receiving good offices, as not to avoid
<PB N="278" REF="87"/>
administering them. That species of independence,
which proudly flies all ties of gratitude, is inimical
to the social compact of civilized life, which subsists
but by reciprocity of services.”</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold now opposed the scheme no longer,
and the chaise was ordered for the next day.</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont hurried home to settle his affairs;
but Edgar begged a short conference with Mr. Ty∣rold.</P>
<P>Every maternal hope was now awake in Mrs. Ty∣rold,
who concluded this request was to demand Ca∣milla
in marriage; and her husband himself not
without trepidation, took Edgar into his study.</P>
<P>But Edgar, though his heart was again wholly
Camilla's, had received a look from Dr. Marchmont
that guarded him from any immediate declaration.
He simply opened upon the late misconception at
Cleves; vindicated himself from any versatility of
conduct, and affirmed, that both his attentions and
his regard for Indiana had never been either more or
less than they still continued. All this was spoken
with a plainness to which the integrity of his cha∣racter
gave a weight superior to any protestations.</P>
<P>“My dear Edgar,” said Mr. Tyrold, “I am
convinced of your probity. The tenor of your life
is its guarantee, and any other defence is a degrada∣tion.
There is, indeed, no perfidy so unjustifiable,
as that which wins but to desert the affections of an
innocent female. It is still, if possible, more cow∣ardly
than i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is cruel; for the greater her worth, and
the more exquisite her feelings, the stronger will be
the impulse of her delicacy to suffer uncomplaining;
and the deluder of her esteem commonly confides, for
averting her reproach, to the very sensibility through
which he has ensnared her good opinion.”</P>
<P>“No one,” said Edgar, “can more sincerely con∣cur
in this sentiment than myself; and I trust, there
is no situation, and no character, that could prompt
me to deviate in this point. Here, in particular,
my understanding must have been as defective as my
<PB N="279" REF="88"/>
morals, to have betrayed me into such an enter∣prise.”</P>
<P>“How do you mean?”</P>
<P>“I beg pardon, my dear Sir; but, though I
have a sort of family regard for Miss Lynmere, and
though I think her beauty is transcendent, her heart,
I believe—” he hesitated.</P>
<P>“Do you think her heart invulnerable?”</P>
<P>“Why—no—not positively, perhaps,” answered
he, embarrassed, “not positively invulnerable; but
certainly I do not think it composed of those <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inely
subtle sensations which elude all vigilance, and be∣come
imperceptibly the prey of every assailing sym∣pathy;
for itself, therefore, I believe it not in much
danger; and, for others—I see not in it that mag∣netic
attraction which charms away all caution, be∣guiles
all security, enwraps the imagination, and
masters the reason!”—</P>
<P>The chain of thinking which, from painting what
he thought insensible in Indiana, led him to describe▪
what he felt to be resistless in Camilla, made him
finish the last sentence with an energy that surprised
Mr. Tyrold into a smile.</P>
<P>“You seem deeply,” he said, “to have studied
the subject.”</P>
<P>“But not under the guidance of Miss Lynmere,”
he answered, rising, and colouring, the moment he
had spoken, in the sear he had betrayed himself.</P>
<P>“I rejoice, then, the more,” replied Mr. Tyrold,
calmly, “in her own slackness of susceptibility.”</P>
<P>“Yes,” cried Edgar, recovering, and quietly re∣placing
himself; “it is her own security, and it is
the security of all who surround her; though to
those, indeed, there was also another, a still greater,
in the contrast which—” he stopt, confused at his
own meaning; yet presently, almost irresistibly,
added—“Not that I think the utmost vivacity of
sentiment, nor all the charm of soul, though eter∣nally
beaming in the eyes, playing in every feature,
glowing in the complection, and brightening every
smile—” he stopt again, overpowered with the
consciousness of the picture he was portraying;
<PB N="280" REF="89"/>
but Mr. Tyrold continuing silent, he was obliged,
though he scarce knew what he said, to go on.
“Nothing, in short, so selfishly are we formed,—
that nothing, not even the loveliest of the lovely,
can be truly bewitching, in which we do not hope or
expect some participation.—I believe I have not made
myself very clear?—However, it is not material—
I simply meant to explain my retreat from Cleves.
And, indeed, it is barbarous, at a season such as
this, to detain you a moment from your family.”</P>
<P>He then hastily took leave.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold was sensibly touched by this scene.
He saw, through a discourse so perplexed, and a
manner so confused, that his daughter had made a
forcible impression upon the heart of Mandlebert,
but could not comprehend why he seemed struggling
to conceal it. What had dropt from his appeared
to imply a distrust of exciting mutual regard; yet
this, after his own observations upon Camilla, was
inconceivable. He regretted, that at a period so
critical, she must part with her mother, with whom
again he now determined to consult.</P>
<P>Edgar, who hitherto had opened his whole heart
upon every occasion to Mr. Tyrold, felt hurt and
distressed at this first withholding of confidence. It
was, however, unavoidable, in his present situation.</P>
<P>He went back to the parlour to take leave once
more of Mrs. Tyrold; but, opening the door, found
Camilla there alone. She was looking out of the
window, and had not heard his entrance.</P>
<P>This was not a sight to still his perturbed spirits;
on the contrary, the moment seemed to him so fa∣vourable,
that it irresistibly occurred to him to seize
it for removing every doubt.</P>
<P>Camilla, who had not even missed her mother and
sister from the room, was contemplating the horse of
Edgar, and internally ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aigning herself for the dan∣gerous
pleasure she had felt and manifested at the
sight of his master.</P>
<P>He gently shut the door, and approaching her,
said, “Do I see again the same frank and amiable
<PB N="281" REF="90"/>
friend, who in earliest days, who always, indeed,
till—”</P>
<P>Camilla, turning round, startled to behold him so
near, and that no one else remained in the room,
blushed excessively, and without hearing what he said,
shut the window; yet opened it the same minute,
stammering out something, but she herself knew not
what, concerning the weather.</P>
<P>The gentlest thoughts crossed the mind of Edgar
at this evident embarrassment, and the most generous
alacrity prompted him to hasten his purpose. He
drew a chair near her, and, in penetrating accents,
said: “Will you suffer me, will you, can you per∣mit
me, to take the privilege of our long friendship,
and honestly to speak to you upon what has passed
within these last few days at Cleves?”</P>
<P>She could not answer: surprise, doubt, fear of
self-deception, and hope of some happy explanation,
all suddenly conspired to confound and to silence her.</P>
<P>“You cannot, I think, forget,” he soon re∣sumed,
“that you had condescended to put into my
hands the management and decision of the new ac∣quaintance
you are anxious to form? My memory,
at least, will never be unfaithful to a testimony so
grateful to me, of your entire reliance upon the deep,
the unspeakable interest I have ever taken, and ever
must take, in my invaluable guardian, and in every
branch of his respected and beloved family.”</P>
<P>Camilla now began to breathe. This last expres∣sion,
though zealous in friendliness, had nothing of
appropriate partiality; and in losing her hope she
resumed her calmness.</P>
<P>Edgar observed, though he understood not, the
change; but as he wished to satisfy his mind before
he indulged his inclination, he endeavoured not to be
sorry to see her mistress of herself during the dis∣cussion.
He wished her but to answer him with
openness: she still, however, only listened, while she
rose and looked about the room for some work. Ed∣gar,
somewhat disconcerted, waited for her again
fitting down; and after a few minutes spent in a
<PB N="282" REF="91"/>
useless search, she drew a chair to a table at some
distance.</P>
<P>Gravely then following, he stood opposite to her,
and, after a little pause, said, “I perceive you think
I go too far? you think that the intimacy of child∣hood,
and the attachment of adolescence, should
expire with the juvenile sports and intercourse which
nourished them, rather than ripen into solid friend∣ship
and permanent confidence?”</P>
<P>“Do not say so,” cried she, with emotion; “be∣lieve
me, unless you knew all that had passed, and all
my motives, you should judge nothing of these last few
days, but think of me only, whether well or ill, as
you thought of me a week ago.”</P>
<P>The most laboured and explicit defence could not
more immediately have satisfied his mind than this
speech. Suspicion vanished, trust and admiration
took its place, and once more drawing a chair by
her side, “My dear Miss Camilla,” he cried, “for∣give
my having thus harped upon this subject; I here
promise you I will name it no more.”</P>
<P>“And I,” cried she, delighted, “promise you”—
she was going to add, that she would give up Mrs.
Arlbery, if he found reason to disapprove the acquaint∣ance;
but the parlour door opened, and Miss Mar∣gland
stalked into the room.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh was going to send a messenger to en∣quire
how and when Mrs. Tyrold had set out; but
Miss Margland, from various motives of curiosity,
offered her services, and came herself. So totally,
however, had both Edgar and Camilla been engrossed
by each other, that they had not heard the carriage
drive up to the garden gate, which, with the door of
the house, being always open, required neither knocker
nor bell.</P>
<P>A spectre could not more have startled or shocked
Camilla. She jumped up, with an exclamation
nearly amounting to a scream, and involuntarily
seated herself at the other end of the room.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="92"/>
Edgar, though not equally embarrassed, was still
more provoked; but he rose, and got her a chair,
and enquired after the health of Sir Hugh.</P>
<P>“He is very poorly, indeed,” answered she, with
an austere air, “and no wonder!”</P>
<P>“I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my uncle ill?” cried Camilla, alarmed.</P>
<P>Miss Margland deigned no reply.</P>
<P>The rest of the family, who had seen the carriage
from the windows, now entered the room, and dur∣ing
the mutual enquiries and account which followed,
Edgar, believing himself unobserved, glided round
Camilla, and in a low voice, said, “The promise—
I think I guess its gratifying import—I shall not,
I hope, lose, through this cruel intrusion?”</P>
<P>Camilla, who saw no eyes but those of Miss Mar∣gland,
which were severely fastened upon her, af∣fected
not to hear him, and planted herself in the
group out of his way.</P>
<P>He anxiously waited for another opportunity to
put in his claim; but he waited in vain; Camilla,
who from the entrance of Miss Margland had had the
depressing feel of self-accusation, sedulously avoided
him; and though he loitered till he was ashamed of
remaining in the house at a period so busy, Miss
Margland, by indications not to be mistaken, shewed
herself bent upon out-staying him; he was obliged,
therefore, to depart; though, no sooner was he gone,
than, having nothing more to scru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inize, she went
also.</P>
<P>But little doubt now remained with the watchful
parents of the mutual attachment of Edgar and Ca∣milla,
to which the only apparent obstacle seemed, a
diffidence on the part of Edgar with respect to her
internal sympathy. Pleased with the modesty of such
a fear in so accomplished a young man, Mr. Tyrold
protested that, if the superior fortune were on the side
of Camilla, he would himself clear it up, and point out
the mistake. His wife gloried in the virtuous deli∣cacy
of her daughter, that so properly, till it was
called for, concealed her tenderness from the object
who so deservingly inspired it; yet they agreed, that
<PB N="284" REF="93"/>
though she could not, at present, meet Edgar too
often, she should be kept wholly ignorant of their
wishes and expectations, lest they should still be
crushed by any unforeseen casualty: and that, mean∣while,
she should be allowed every safe and innocent
recreation, that might lighten her mind from its
depression, and restore her spirits to their native vi∣vacity.</P>
<P>Early the next morning Dr. Marchmont came to
Etherington, and brought with him Lionel, by the
express direction of his father, who never objected
to admit the faulty to his presence; his hopes of
doing good were more potent from kindness than
from severity, from example than from precept: yet
he attempted not to conquer the averseness of Mrs.
Tyrold to an interview; he knew it proceeded not
from an inexorable nature, but from a repugnance
insurmountable to the sight of a beloved object in
disgrace.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold quitted her husband with the most
cruel regret, and her darling Camilla with the ten∣derest
inquietude; she affectionately embraced the
unexceptionable Lavinia, with whom she left a mes∣sage
for her brother, which she strictly charged her
to deliver, without softening or omitting one word.</P>
<P>And then, attended by Dr. Marchmont, she set
forward on her journey towards Falmouth: whence
a packet, in a few days, she was informed, would
sail for Lisbon.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="32" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Modern Ideas of Life.</HEAD>
<P>GRIEVED at this separation, Mr. Tyrold re∣tired
to his study; and his two daughters went to
the apartment of Lionel, to comfort him under the
weight of his misconduct.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="94"/>
They found him sincerely affected and repentant;
yet eager to hear that his mother was actually gone.
Ill as he felt himself to deserve such an exertion for
his future welfare, and poignant as were his shame
and sorrow to have parted her from his excellent
father, he thought all evil preferable to encounter∣ing
her eye, or listening to her admonitions.</P>
<P>Though una<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ectedly beloved, Mrs. Tyrold was
deeply feared by all her children, Camilla alone ex∣cepted;
by Lionel, from his horror of reproof; by
Lavinia, from the timidity of her humility; and by
Eugenia, from her high sense of parental superiority.
Camilla alone escaped the contagion; for while too
innocent, too undesigning, wilfully to excite dis∣pleasure,
she was too gay and too light-hearted to
admit apprehension without cause.</P>
<P>The gentle Lavinia knew not how to perform her
painful task of delivering the message with which she
was commissioned. The sight of Lionel in dejection
was as sad as it was new to her, and she resolved, in
conjunction with Camilla, to spare him till the next
day, when his feelings might be less acute. They
each sat down, therefore, to work, silent and com∣passionate;
while he, ejaculating blessings upon his
parents, and calling for just venge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce upon him∣self,
stroamed up and down the room, biting his
knuckles, and now and then striking his forehead.</P>
<P>This lasted about ten minutes: and then, sud∣denly
advancing to his sisters, and snatching a hand
of each: “Come, girls,” he cried, “now let's
talk of other things.”</P>
<P>Too young to have developed the character of
Lionel, they were again as much astonished as they
had been the preceding day: but his defects, though
not originally of the heart, were of a species that
soon tend to harden it. They had their rise in a
total aversion to reflection, a wish to distinguish him∣self
from his retired, and, he thought, unfashion∣able
relations, and an unfortunate coalition with
some unprincipled young men, who, because flashy
and gay, could lead him to whatever they proposed.
<PB N="286" REF="95"/>
Yet, when mischief or misfortune ensued from his
wanton faults, he was always far more sorry than he
thought it manly to own; but as his actions were
without judgment, his repentance was without prin∣ciple;
and he was ready for some new enterprise the
moment the difficulties of an old one subsided.</P>
<P>Camilla, who, from her affection to him, read
his character through the innocence of her own, met
his returning gaiety with a pleasure that was propor∣tioned
to her pain at his depression; but Lavinia saw
it with discomfort, as the signal for executing her
charge, and, with extreme reluctance, gave him to
understand she had a command to fulfil to him from
his mother.</P>
<P>The powers of conscience were again then in∣stantly
at work; he felt what he had deserved, he
dreaded to hear what he had provoked; and trem∣bling
a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d drawing back, entreated her to wait one
half hour before she entered upon the business.</P>
<P>She chearfully consented; and Camilla proposed
extending the reprieve to the next day: but not two
minutes elapsed, before Lionel protested he could
not bear the suspense, and urged an immediate com∣munication.</P>
<P>“She can have said nothing,” cried he, “worse
than I expect, or than I merit. Probe me then
without delay. She is acting by me like an angel,
and if she were to command me to turn anchoret, I
know I ought to obey her.”</P>
<P>With much hesitation, Lavinia then began. “My
mother s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ys, my dear Lionel, the fraud you have
practised—”</P>
<P>“The fraud! what a horrid word! why it was
a mere trick! a joke! a frolic! just to make an
old hunks open his purse-strings for his natural heir.
I am astonished at my mother! I really don't care
if I don't hear another syllable.”</P>
<P>“Well, then, my dear Lionel, I will wait till
you are calmer: my mother, I am sure did not mean
to irritate, but to convince.”</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="96"/>
“My mother,” continued he, striding about the
room, “makes no allowances. She has no faults
herself, and for that reason she thinks nobody else
should have any. Besides, how should she know
what it is to be a young man? and to want a little
cash, and not know how to get it?”</P>
<P>“But I am sure,” said Lavinia, “if you wanted
it for any proper purpose, my father would have de∣nied
himself every thing, in order to supply you.”</P>
<P>“Yes, yes; but suppose I want it for a purpose
that is <HI>not</HI> proper, how am I to get it th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>?”</P>
<P>“Why, then, my dear Lionel, surely you must
be sensible you ought to go without it,” cried the
sisters, in a breath.</P>
<P>“Ay, that's as you girls say, that know nothing
of the matter. If a young man, when he goes
into the world, was to make such a speech as that,
he would be pointed at. Besides, who must he live
with? You don't suppose he is to shut himself
up, with a few musty books, sleeping over the fire,
under pretence of study, all day long, do you?
like young Melmond, who knows no more of the
world than one of you do?”</P>
<P>“Indeed,” said Camilla, “he seemed to me an
amiable and modest young man, though very ro∣mantic.”</P>
<P>“O, I dare say he did! I could have laid any
wager of that. He's just a girl's man, just the very
thing, all sentiment, and poetry and heroics. But
we, my little dear, we lads of spirit, hold all that
amazing cheap. I assure you, I would as soon be
seen trying on a lady's cap at a glass, as poring over
a crazy old author, when I could help it. I warrant
you think, because one is at the university, one must
all be book-worms?”</P>
<P>“Why, what else do you go there for but to
study?”</P>
<P>“Every thing in the world, my dear.”</P>
<P>“But are there not sometimes young men who
are scholars without being book-worms?” cried Ca∣milla,
<PB N="288" REF="97"/>
half colouring; “is not—is not Edgar Man∣dlebert—”</P>
<P>“O yes, yes; an odd thing of that sort happens
now and then. Mandlebert has spirit enough to
carry it off pretty well, without being ridiculous;
though he is as deep, for his time, as e'er an old
fellow of a college. But then this is no rule for
others. You must not expect an Edgar Mandlebert
at every turn.”</P>
<P>Ah no! thought Camilla.</P>
<P>“But, Edgar,” said Lavinia, “has had an ex∣traordinary
education, as well as possessing extraor∣dinary
talents and goodness: and you, too, my dear
Lionel, to fulfil what may be expected from you,
should look back to your father, who was brought
up at the same university, and is now considered as
one of the first men it has produced. While he was
respected by the learned for his application, he was
loved even by the indolent for his candour and kind∣ness
of heart. And though his income, as you
know, was so small, he never ran in debt, and by an
exact but open oeconomy, escaped all imputation of
meanness: while by forbearing either to conceal, or
repine at his limited fortune, he bl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nted even the
raillery of the dissipated, by frankly and good hu∣mouredly
meeting it half way. How often have I
heard my dear mother tell you this!”</P>
<P>“Yes; but all this, child, is nothing to the pur∣pose;
my father is no more like other men than if
he had been born in another planet, and my at∣tempting
to resemble him, is as great a joke, as if
you were to dress up Miss Margland in Indiana's
flowers and feathers, and then expect people to call
her a beauty.”</P>
<P>“We do not say you resemble my father, now,”
said Camilla, archly; “but is there any reason why
you should not try to do it by and by?”</P>
<P>“O yes! a little one! nature, nature, my dear,
is in the way. I was born a bit of a buck. I have
no manner of natural taste for study, and poring,
and expounding, and black-letter work. I am a
<PB N="289" REF="98"/>
light, airy spark, at your service, not quite so wise
as I am merry;—but let that pass. My father, you
know, is firm as a rock. He minds neither wind
nor weather, nor fleerer nor sneerer: but this firm∣ness,
look ye, he has kept all to himself; not a
whit of it do I inherit; every wind that blows veer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
me about, and makes me look some new way.”</P>
<P>Soon after, gathering courage from curiosity, he
desired to hear the message at once.</P>
<P>Lavinia, unwillingly complying, then repeated:
“The fraud which you have practised, my mother
says, whether from wanton folly to give pain, or
from rapacious discontent to gain money, she will
leave without comment, satisfied that if you have
any heart at all, its effects must bring its remorse,
since it has dangerously encreased the infirmities of
your uncle, driven him to a foreign land, and forced
your mother to forsake her home and family in his
pursuit, unless she were willing to see you punished
by the entire disinheritance with which you are
threatened. But—”</P>
<P>“O, no more! no more! I am ready to shoot
myself already! My dear, excellent mother! what
do I not owe you! I had never seen, never thought
of the business in this solemn way before. I meant
nothing at first but a silly joke, and all this mischief
has followed unaccountably. I assure you, I had
no notion at the beginning he would have minded
the letter; and afterwards, Jack Whiston persuaded
me, the money was as good as my own, and that it
was nothing but a little cribbing from myself. I
will never trust him again; I see the whole now in
its true and atrocious colours.—I will devote myself
in future to make all the amends in my power to my
dear incomparable mother.”</P>
<P>The sisters affectionately encouraged this idea,
which produced near a quarter of an hour's serious
thinking and penitence.</P>
<P>He then begged to hear the rest; and Lavinia
continued.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="99"/>
“But since you are re-admitted, said my mother,
to Etherington, by the clemency of your forbearing
father, she charges you to remember, you can only
repay his goodness by an application the most intense
to those studies you have hitherto neglected, and of
which your neglect has been the cause of all you<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
errors; by committing to idle amusements the time
that innocently, as well as profitably, ought to have
been dedicated to the attainment of knowledge. She
charges you also to ask yourself, since, during the
vacation, your father himself is your tutor, upon
what pretext you can justify wasting his valuable
time, however little you may respect your own?—
Finally—”</P>
<P>“I never wasted his time! I never desired to
have any instruction in the vacations. 'Tis the most
deuced thing in life to be studying so hard inces∣santly.
The waste of time is all his own affair;—
his own choice—not mine, I assure you! Go on,
however.”</P>
<P>“Finally, she adjures you to consider, that if you
still persevere to consume your time in wilful negli∣gence,
to bury all thought in idle gaiety, and to act
without either reflection or principle, the career of
faults which begins but in unthinking folly, will ter∣minate
in shame, in guilt, and in ruin! And though
such a declension of all good, must involve your fa∣mily
in your affliction, your disgrace, she bids me
say, will ultimately fall but where it ought; since
your own want of personal sensibility to the horror
of your conduct, will neither harden nor blind any
human being besides yourself. This is all.”</P>
<P>“And enough too,” cried he, reddening; “I
am a very wretch!—I believe that—though I am
sure I can't tell how; for I never intend any harm,
never think, never dream of hurting any mortal!
But as to study—I must own to you, I hate it most
deucedly. Any thing else—if my mother had but
exacted any thing else—with what joy I would have
shewn my obedience!—If she had ordered me to be
<PB N="291" REF="100"/>
horse-ponded, I do protest to you, I would not have
demurred.”</P>
<P>“How always you run into the ridiculous!”
cried Camilla.</P>
<P>“I was never so serious in my life; not that I
should like to be horse-ponded in the least, though I
would submit to it for a punishment, and out of
duty: but then, when it was done, it would be
over: now the deuce of study is, there is no end of
it! And it does so little for one! one can go through
life so well without it! There is not above here and
there an old codger that asks one a question that can
bring it into any play. And then, a turn upon one's
heel, or looking at one's watch, or wondering at
one's short memory, or happening to forget just that
one single passage, carries off the whole in two mi∣nutes,
as compltely as if one had been working
one's whole life to get ready for the assault. And
pray, now, tell me, how can it be worth one's best
days, one's gayest hours, the very flower of one's
life—all to be sacrificed to plodding over musty
grammars and lexicons, merely to cut a figure just
for about two minutes once or twice in a year?”</P>
<P>The sisters, brought up with an early reverence
for learning, as forming a distinguished part of the
accomplishments of their father, could not subscribe
to this argument. But they laughed; and that was
ever sufficient for Lionel, who, though sincerely, in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ivate, he loved and honoured his father, never be∣stowed
upon him one voluntary moment that frolic or
folly invited elsewhere.</P>
<P>Lavinia and Camilla, perfectly relieved now from
all fears for their brother, repaired to the study of
their father, anxious to endeavour to chear him, and
to accelerate a meeting and reconciliation for Lionel;
but they found him desirous to be alone, though
kindly, and unsolicited, he promised to admit his son
before dinner.</P>
<P>Lionel heard this with a just awe; but gave it no
time for deep impression. It was still very early, and
he could settle himself to nothing during the hours
<PB N="292" REF="101"/>
yet to pass before the interview. He persuaded his
sisters, therefore, to walk out with him, to wile
away at once expectation and retrospection.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="33" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Modern Notions of Penitence.</HEAD>
<P>THEY set out with no other plan than to take a
three hours stroll. Lionel led the way, and they
journied through various pleasant lanes and meadows,
till, about three miles distance from Etherington,
upon ascending a beautiful little hill, they espied,
fifty yards off, the Grove, and a party of company
sauntering round its grounds.</P>
<P>He immediately proposed making a visit to Mrs.
Arlbery; but Lavinia declined presenting herself to
a lady who was unknown to her mother; and Ca∣milla,
impressed with the promise she had intended
for Edgar, which she was sure, though unpro∣nounced,
he had comprehended, dissented also from
the motion.</P>
<P>He then said he would go alone; for his spirits
were so low from vexation and regret, that they
wanted recruit; and he would return to them by the
time they would be sufficiently rested to walk home.</P>
<P>To this they agreed; and amused themselves with
watching to see him join the group; in which, how∣ever,
they were no sooner gratified, than, to their
great confusion, they perceived that he pointed them
out, and that all eyes were immediately directed
towards the hill.</P>
<P>Vexed and astonished at his quick passing penitence,
they hastened down the declivity, and ran on till a
lane, with an high hedge on each side, sheltered
them from view.</P>
<P>But Lionel, soon pursuing them, said he brought
the indisputable orders of his invincible widow to
<PB N="293" REF="102"/>
convoy them to the mansion. She never, she had
owned, admitted formal visitors, but whatever was
abrupt and out of the way, won her heart.</P>
<P>To the prudent Lavinia, this invitation was by
no means alluring. Mrs. Tyrold, from keeping no
carriage, visited but little, and the Grove was not
included in her small circle; Lavinia, therefore,
though she knew not how to be peremptory, was
steady in refusal; and Camilla, who would naturally
with pleasure have yielded, had a stronger motive for
firmness, than any with which she was gifted by dis∣cretion,
in her wish to oblige Mandlebert. But
Lionel would listen to neither of them; and when
he found his insistance insufficient, seized Lavinia by
one arm, and Camilla by the other, and dragged
them up the hill, in defiance of their entreaties,
and in full view of the party. He then lest the
more pleading, though less resisting, Lavinia alone;
but pulled Camilla down by the opposite side, with
a velocity that, though meant but to bring her to
the verge of a small rivulet, forced her into the
midst of it so rapidly that he could not himself at
last stop: and wetted her so completely, that she
could with difficulty, when she got across it, walk on.</P>
<P>The violent spirits of Lionel always carried him
beyond his own intentions; he was now really sorry
for what he had done: and Lavinia, who had quietly
followed, was uneasy from the fear of some ill con∣sequence
to her sister.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, who had seen the transaction, came
forth now herself, to invite them all into her house,
and offer a fire and dry clothing to Camilla; not
sparing, however, her well-merited raillery at the
awkward exploit of young Tyrold.</P>
<P>Camilla, ashamed to be thus seen, would have
hidden herself behind her sister, and retreated; but
even Lavinia now, fearing for her health, joined in the
request, and she was obliged to enter the house.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery took her up stairs, to her own
apartment, and supplied her immediately with a com∣plete
change of apparel; protesting that Lionel
<PB N="294" REF="103"/>
should be punished for his frolic, by a solitary walk
to Etherington, to announce that she would keep
his two sisters for the day.</P>
<P>Opposition was vain; she was gay, good-hu∣moured,
and pleasant, but she would not be denied.
She meant not, however, to inflict the serious pe∣nalty
which the face of Lionel proclaimed him to be
suffering, when he prepared to depart; and the sis∣ters,
who read in it his dread of meeting Mr. Ty∣rold
alone, in the present circumstances of his af∣fairs,
conferred together, and agreed that Lavinia
should accompany him, both to intercede for return∣ing
favour from his father, and to explain the acci∣dent
of Camilla's staying at the Grove. Mrs. Arl∣bery,
meanwhile, promised to restore her young
guest safe at night in her own carriage.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the pleasure with which Camilla,
in any other situation, would have renewed this ac∣quaintance,
was now changed into reluctance, she
was far from insensible to the flattering kindness with
which Mrs. Arlbery received and entertained her,
nor to the frankness with which she confessed, that
her invisibility the other morning, had resulted solely
from pique that the visit had not been made sooner.</P>
<P>Camilla would have attempted some apology for
the delay, but she assured her apologies were what
she neither took nor gave; and then laughingly
added—“We will try one another to-day, and if
we find it won't do—we will shake hands and part.
That, you must know, is my mode; and is it not
vastly better than keeping up an acquaintance that
proves dull, merely because it has been begun?”</P>
<P>She then ordered away all her visitors, without
the smallest ceremony; telling them, however, they
might come back in the evening, only desiring they
would not be early. Camilla stared; but they all
submitted as to a thing of course.</P>
<P>“You are not used to my way, I perceive,” cried
she, smiling; “yet, I can nevertheless assure you,
you can do nothing so much for your happiness as to
adopt it. You are made a slave in a moment by the
<PB N="295" REF="104"/>
world, if you don't begin life by defying it. Take
your own way, follow your own humour, and you
and the world will both go on just as well, as if you
ask its will and pleasure for every thing you do, and
want, and think.”</P>
<P>She then expressed herself delighted with Lionel,
for bringing them together by this short cut, which
abolished a world of formalities, not more customary
than fatiguing. “I pass, I know,” continued she,
“for a mere creature of whim; but, believe me,
there is no small touch of philosophy in the compo∣sition
of my vagaries. Extremes, you know, have
a mighty knack of meeting. Thus I, like the sage,
though not with sage-like motives, save time that
must otherwise be wasted; brave rules that would
murder common sense; and when I have made peo∣ple
stare, turn another way that I may laugh.”</P>
<P>She then, in a graver strain, and in a manner that
proved the laws of politeness all her own, where she
chose, for any particular purpose, or inclination, to
exert them, hoped this profession of her faith would
plead her excuse, that she had thus incongruously
made her fair guest a second time enter her house,
before her first visit was acknowledged; and en∣quired
whether it were to be returned at Ethering∣ton
or at Cleves.</P>
<P>Camilla answered, she was now at home, on ac∣count
of her mother's being obliged to make a voy∣age
to Lisbon.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery said, she would certainly, then,
wait upon her at Etherington; and very civilly re∣gretted
having no acquaintance with Mrs. Tyrold;
archly, however, adding: “As we have no where
met, I could not seek her at her own house without
running too great a risk; for then, whether I had
liked her or not, I must have received her, you know,
into mine. So, you see, I am not quite without
prudence, whatever the dear world says to the con∣trary.”</P>
<P>She then spoke of the ball, public breakfast, and
raffle; chatting both upon persons and things with
<PB N="296" REF="105"/>
an easy gaiety, and sprightly negligence, extremely
amusing to Camilla, and which soon, in despight of
the unwillingness with which she had entered her
house, brought back her original propensity to make
the acquaintance, and lest no regret for what Lionel
had done, except what rested upon the repugnance
of Edgar to this intercourse. As he could not;
however, reproach what was begun without her con∣currence,
he would see, she hoped, like herself, that
common civility henceforward would exact its con∣tinuance.</P>
<P>In proportion as her pleasure from this accidental
commerce was awakened, and her early partiality re∣vived,
her own spirits re-animated, and, in the
course of the many hours they now spent completely
together, she was set so entirely at her ease, by the
good humour of Mrs. Arlbery, that she lost all fear
of her wit. She found it rather playful than satiri∣cal;
rather seeking to amuse than to disconcert; and
though sometimes, from the resistless pleasure of ut∣tering
a <HI>bon mot</HI> she thought more of its brilliancy
than of the pain it might inflict, this happened but
rarely, and was more commonly succeeded by regret
than by triumph.</P>
<P>Camilla soon observed she had, personally, nothing
to apprehend, peculiar partiality supplying the place
of general delicacy, in shielding her from every shaft
that even pleasantry could render poignant. The
embarrassment, therefore, which, in ingenuous youth,
checks the attempt to please, by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear of failure, or
shame of exertion, gave way to natural spirits, which
gaily rising from entertainment received, restored her
vivacity, and gradually, though unconsciously, en∣abled
her to do justice to her own abilities, by unaf∣fectedly
calling forth the mingled sweetness and in∣telligence
of her character; and Mrs. Arlbery,
charmed with all she observed, and flattered by all
she inspired, felt such satisfaction in her evident con∣quest,
that before the <HI>téte à téte</HI> was closed, their ad∣miration
was become nearly mutual.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="106"/>
When the evening party was announced, they
both heard with surprise that the day was so far ad∣vanced.
“They can wait, however,” said Mrs.
Arlbery, “for I know they have nothing to do.”</P>
<P>She then invited Camilla to return to her the next
day for a week.</P>
<P>Camilla felt well disposed to comply, hoping soon
to reason from Edgar his prejudice against a connec∣tion
that afforded her such singular pleasure; but to
leave her father at this period was far from every
wish. She excused herself, therefore, saying, she
had still six weeks due to her uncle at Cleves, before
any other engagement could take place.</P>
<P>“Well, then, when you quit your home for Sir
Hugh, will you beg off a few days from him, and
set them down to my account?”</P>
<P>“If my uncle pleases—”</P>
<P>“If he pleases?” repeated she, laughing; “pray
never give that <HI>If</HI> into his decision; you only put
contradiction into people's heads, by asking what
pleases them. Say at once, My good uncle, Mrs.
Arlbery has invited me to indulge her with a few
days at the Grove; so to-morrow I shall go to her.
Will you promise me this?”</P>
<P>“Dear madam, no! my uncle would think me
mad.”</P>
<P>“And suppose he should? A little alarm now
and then keeps life from stagnation. They call me
mad, I know, sometimes; wild, slighty, and what
not; yet you see how harmless I am, though I
afford food for such notable commentary.”</P>
<P>“But can you really like such things should be
said of you?”</P>
<P>“I adore the frankness of that question! why,
n—o,—I rather think I don't. But I'm not sure.
However, to prevent their minding me, I must mind
them. And it's vastly more irksome to give up one's
own way, than to hear a few impertinent remarks.
And as to the world, depend upon it, my dear Miss
Tyrold, the more you see of it, the less you will
care for it.”</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="107"/>
She then said she would leave her to re-invest her∣self
in her own attire, and go down stairs, to see
what the poor simple souls, who had had no more
wit than to come back thus at her call, had found
to do with themselves.</P>
<P>Camilla, having only her common morning dress,
and even that utterly spoilt, begged that her appear∣ance
might be dispensed with; but Mrs. Arlbery,
exclaiming, “Why, there are only men; you don't
mind men, I hope!” ashamed, she promised to get
ready; yet she had not sufficient courage to descend,
till her gay hostess came back, and accompanied her
to the drawing room.</P>
</DIV1>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Airs and Graces.</HEAD>
<P>UPON entering the room, Camilla saw again the
Officers who had been there in the morning, and
who were now joined by Sir Sedley Clarendel. She
was met at the door by Major Cerwood, who seemed
waiting for her appearance, and who made her his
compliments with an air that studiously proclaimed
his devotion. She seated herself by the side of Mrs.
Arlbery, to look on at a game of chess, played by
Sir Sedley and General Kinsale.</P>
<P>“Clarendel,” said Mrs. Arlbery, “you have
not the least in the world the air of knowing what
you are about.”</P>
<P>“Pardon me, ma'am,” said the General, “he
has been at least half an hour contemplating this
very move,—for which, as you see, I now check∣mate
him. Pray, Sir Sedley, how came you, at
last, to do no better?”</P>
<P>“Thinking of other things, my dear General.
'Tis impossible in the extreme to keep one's faculties
pinioned down to the abstruse vagaries of this brain∣besieging
<PB N="299" REF="108"/>
game. My head would be deranged past
redress, if I did not allow it to visit the four quar∣ters
of the globe once, at least, between every
move.”</P>
<P>“You do not play so slow, then, from delibe∣rating
upon your chances, but from from forgetting
them?”</P>
<P>“Defined, my dear General, to scrupulosity!
Those exquisite little moments we steal from any
given occupation, for the pleasure of speculating in
secret upon something wholly foreign to it, are re∣sistless
to deliciousness.”</P>
<P>“I entreat, and command you then,” cried
Mrs. Arlbery, “to make your speculations public.
Nothing will more amuse me, than to have the least
intimation of the subjects of your reveries.”</P>
<P>“My dear Mrs. Arlbery! your demand is the
very quintessence of impossibility! Tell the subject
of a reverie! know you not it wafts one at once ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of the world, and the world's powers of expression?
while all it substitutes is as evanescent as it is delect∣able.
To attempt the least description would be a
presumption of the first monstrousness.”</P>
<P>“O never heed that! presumption will not pre∣cisely
be a novelty to you; answer me, therefore,
my dear Clarendel, without all this conceit. You
know I hate procrastination; and procrastinators
still worse.”</P>
<P>“Softly, dearest madam, softly! There is no∣thing
in nature so horribly shocking to me as the
least hurry. My poor nerves seek repose after any
turbulent words, or jarring sounds, with the same
craving for rest that my body experiences after the
jolts, and concussions of a long-winded chase. By
the way, does any body want a good hunter? I
have the first, perhaps, in Europe; but I would
sell it a surprising bargain, for I am excruciatingly
tired of it.”</P>
<P>All the gentlemen grouped round him to hear fur∣ther
particulars, except Mr. Macdersey, the young
Ensign, who had so unguardedly exposed himself at
<PB N="300" REF="109"/>
the Northwick ball, and who now, approaching Ca∣milla,
fervently exclaimed; “How happy I should
have been, madam, if I had had the good fortune
to see you meet with that accident this morning, in∣stead
of being looking another way! I might then
have had the pleasure to assist you. And O! how
much more if it had been your divine cousin! I
hope that fair angel is in perfect health! O what a
beautiful creature she is! her outside is the com∣pletest
diamond I ever saw! and if her inside is the
same, which I dare say it is, by her smiles and deli∣cate
dimples, she must be a paragon upon earth!”</P>
<P>“There is at least something very inartificial in
your praise,” said General Kinsale, “when you
make your panegyric of an absent lady to a present
one.”</P>
<P>“O General, there is not a lady living can bear
any comparison with her. I have never had her out
of my thoughts from the first darling moment that
ever I saw her, which has made me the most mi∣serable
of men ever since. Her eyes so beautiful,
her mouth so divine, her nose so heavenly!—”</P>
<P>“And how,” cried Sir Sedley, “is the tip of
her chin?”</P>
<P>“No joking, Sir!” said the Ensign, reddening;
“she is a piece of perfection not to be laughed at;
she has never had her fellow upon the face of the
earth; and she never will have it while the earth
holds, upon account of there being no such person
above ground.”</P>
<P>“And pray,” cried Sir Sedley, carelessly, “how
can you be sure of that?”</P>
<P>“How! why by being certain,” answered the
inflamed admirer; “for though I have been look∣ing
out for pretty women from morning to night,
ever since I was conscious of the right use of my
eyes, I never yet saw her parallel.”</P>
<P>A servant was now bringing in the tea; but his
lady ordered him to set it down in the next room,
whence the gentlemen should fetch it as it was,
wanted.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="110"/>
Major Cerwood took in charge all attendance
upon Camilla; but he was not, therefore, exempt
from the assiduities required by Mrs. Arlbery, for
whom the homage of the General, the Colonel, and
the Ensign, were insufficient; and who, had a score
more been present, would have found occupation for
them all. Sir Sedley alone was excepted from her
commands; for knowing they would be issued to
him in vain, she contented herself with only inter∣changing
glances of triumph with him, at the sub∣mission
of every vassal but himself.</P>
<P>“Heavens!” cried she, to Colonel Andover,
who had hastened to present her the first cup, “you
surely think I have nerves for a public o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ator! If I
should taste but one drop of this tea, I might envy
the repose of the next m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n who robs on the high∣way.
Major Cerwood, will you try if you can do
any better for me?”</P>
<P>The Major obeyed, but not with more success.
“What in the world have you brought me?” cried
she; “Is it tea? It looks prodigiously as if just im∣ported
out of the stop bason. For pity sake, Mac∣dersey,
arise, and give me your help; you will at
least never bring me such maudlin stuff as this. Even
your tea will have some character; it will be very
good or very bad; very hot or very cold; very strong
or very weak; for you are always in flames of fire,
or slakes of snow.”</P>
<P>“You do me justice, ma'am; there is nothing
upon the face of the earth so insipid as a medium.
Give me love or hate! a friend that will go to jail
for me, or an enemy that will run me through the
body! Riches to chuck guineas about-like half-pence,
or poverty to beg in a ditch! Liberty wild
as the four winds, or an oar to work in a galley!
Misery to tear my heart into an hundred thousand
millions of atoms, or joy to make my foul dance into
my brain! Every thing has some gratification, ex∣cept
a medium. 'Tis a poor little soul that is satis∣fied
between happiness and despair.”</P>
<P>He then flew to bring her a dish of tea.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="111"/>
“My dear Macdersey,” cried she, in receiving it,
“this is according to your system indeed; for 'tis
a compound of strong, and rich, and sweet, to cloy
an alderman, making altogether so luscious a syrup,
that our spring would be exhausted before I could
slake my thirst, if I should taste it only a second
time. Do, dear General, see if it is not possible to
get me some beverage that I can swallow.”</P>
<P>The youngest man present was not more active
than the General in this service; but Mrs. Arlbery,
casting herself despondingly back the moment she
had tasted what he brought her, exclaimed, “Why
this is worst of all! If you can do no better for me,
General, than this, tell me, at least, for mercy's
sake, when some other regiment will be quartered
here?”</P>
<P>“What a cruelty,” said the Major, looking
with a sigh towards Camilla, “to remind your un∣happy
prey they are but birds of passage!”</P>
<P>“O, all the better, Major. If you understand
your own interest you will be as eager to break up
your quarters, as I can be to see your successors
march into them. I have now heard-all your com∣pliments,
and you have heard all my repartees; both
sides, therefore, want new auditors. A great many
things I have said to you will do vastly well again
for a new corps; and, to do you justice, some few
things you have said yourselves may do again in a
new county.”</P>
<P>Then, addressing Camilla, she proposed, though
without moving, that they should converse with one
another, and leave the men to take care of them∣selves.
“And excessively they will be obliged to
me,” she continued, without lowering her voice,
“for giving this little holiday to their poor brains;
for, I assure you, they have not known what to say
this half hour. Indeed, since the first fortnight
they were quartered here, they have not, upon an
average, said above one new thing in three days.
But one's obliged to take up with Officers in the
<PB N="303" REF="112"/>
country, because there's almost nothing else. Can
you recommend me any agreeable new people?”</P>
<P>“O no, ma'am! I have hardly any acquaintance,
except immediately round the rectory; but, fortu∣nately,
my own family is so large, that I have never
been distressed for society.”</P>
<P>“O, ay, true! your own family, begin with
that; do, pray, give me a little history of your own
family?”</P>
<P>“I have no history, ma'am, to give, for my fa∣ther's
retired life—”</P>
<P>“O, I have seen your father, and I have heard
him preach, and I like him very much. There's
something in him there's no turning into ridicule.”</P>
<P>Camilla, though surprised, was delighted by such a
testimony to the respectability of her father; and,
with more courage, said—“And, I am sure, if you
knew my mother, you would allow her the same ex∣emption.”</P>
<P>“So I hear; therefore, we won't talk of them.
It's a delightful thing to think of perfection; but
it's vastly more amusing to talk of errors and absur∣dities.
To begin with your eldest sister, then—but
no; she seems in just the same predicament as your
father and mother: so we'll let her rest, too.”</P>
<P>“Indeed she is; she is as faultless—”</P>
<P>“O, not a word more then; she won't do for me
at all. But, pray, is there not a single soul in all the
round of your large family, that can afford a body a
little innocent diversion?”</P>
<P>“Ah, madam,” said Camilla, shaking her head;
“I fear, on the contrary, if they came under your
examination, there is not one in whom you would
not discern some foible!”</P>
<P>“I should not like them at all the worse for that;
for, between ourselves, my dear Miss Tyrold, I am
half afraid they might find a foible or two in return
in me; so you must not be angry if I beg the favour
of your to indulge me with a few of their defects.”</P>
<P>“Indulge you!”</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="113"/>
“Yes, for when so many of a family are perfect,
if you can't find me one or two that have a little
sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck of mortality, you must not wonder if I take
flight at your very name. In charity, therefore, if
you would not drop my acquaintance, tell me their
vulnerable parts”</P>
<P>Camilla laughed at this ridiculous reasoning, but
would not enter into its consequences.</P>
<P>“Well, then, if you will not assist me, don't take
it ill that I assist myself. In the first place, there's
your brother; I don't ask you to tell me any thing
of him; I have seen him! and I confess to you he
does not put me into utter despair! he does not
alarm me into flying all his race.”</P>
<P>Camilla tried vainly to look grave.</P>
<P>“I have seen another, too, your cousin, I think;
Miss Lynmere, that's engaged to young Mandlebert.”</P>
<P>Camilla now tried as vainly to look gay.</P>
<P>“She's prodigiously pretty. Pray, is not she a
great sool?”</P>
<P>“Ma'am?”</P>
<P>“I beg your pardon! but I don't suppose you are
responsible for the intellects of all your generation.
However, she'll do vastly well; you need not be
uneasy for her. A face like that will take very good
care of itself. I am glad she is engaged, for your
sake, though I am sorry for Mandlebert; that is, if,
as his class of countenance generally predicts, he
marries with any notion of expecting to be happy.”</P>
<P>“But why, ma'am,” cried Camilla, checking a
sigh, “are you glad for my sake?”</P>
<P>“Because there are two reasons why she would be
wonderfully in your way; she is not only prettier
than you, but sillier.”</P>
<P>“And would both those reasons,” cried Camilla,
again laughing, “make against me?”</P>
<P>“O, intolerably, with the men! They are al∣ways
enchanted with something that is both pretty
and silly; because they can so easily please and so
soon disconcert it; and when they have made the
little blooming fools blush and look down, they feel
<PB N="305" REF="114"/>
nobly superior, and pride themselves in victory.
Dear creatures! I delight in their taste; for it brings
them a plentiful harvest of repentance, when it is
their connubial criterion; the pretty flies off, and
the silly remains, and a man then has a choice com∣panion
for life left on his hands!”</P>
<P>The young Ensign here could no longer be silent:
“I am sure and certain,” cried he, warmly, “Miss
Lynmere is incapable to be a fool! and when she
marries, if her husband thinks her so, it's only a sign
he's a blockhead himself.”</P>
<P>“He'll be exactly of your opinion for the first
month or two,” answered Mrs. Arlbery, “or even
if he is not, he'll like her just as well. A man looks
enchanted while his beautiful young bride talks non∣sense;
it comes so prettily from her ruby lips, and
she blushes and dimples with such lovely attraction
while she utters it; he casts his eyes around him with
conscious elation to see her admirers, and his enviers;
but he has amply his turn for looking like a fool
himself, when youth and beauty take flight, and
when his ugly old wife exposes her ignorance or folly
at every word.”</P>
<P>“The contrast of beginning and end,” said the
General, “is almost always melancholy. But how
rarely does any man,—nay, I had nearly said, or any
woman—think a moment of the time to come, or of
any time but the present day, in marrying?”</P>
<P>“Except with respect to fortune!” cried Mrs.
Arlbery, “and there, methinks you men, at least,
are commonly sufficiently provident. I don't think
reflection is generally what you want in that point.”</P>
<P>“As to reflection,” exclaimed Mr. Macdersey,
“'tis the thing in the world I look upon to be the
meanest! a man capable of reflection, where a beau∣tiful
young creature is in question, can have no soul
nor vitals. For my part, 'tis my only misfortune
that I cannot get at that lovely girl, to ask her for
her private opinion of me at once, that I might
either get a licence to-morrow, or drive her out of
my head before sleep overtakes me another night.”</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="115"/>
“Your passions, my good Macdersey,” said Mrs.
Arlbery, “considering their violence, seem tolerably
obedient. Can you really be so fond, or so forget∣ful
at such short warning?”</P>
<P>“Yes, but it's with a pain that breaks my heart
every time.”</P>
<P>“You contrive, however, to get it pretty soon
mended!”</P>
<P>“That, madam, is a power that has come upon
me by degrees; I have paid dear enough for it!—nobody
ever found it harder than I did at the be∣ginning;
for the first two or three times I took my
disappointments so to heart, that I should have been
bound for ever to any friend that would have had the
good nature to blow my brains out.”</P>
<P>“But now you are so much in the habit of expe∣riencing
these little failures, that they pass on as
things of course?”</P>
<P>“No, madam, you injure me, and in the tenderest
point; for, as long as I have the least hope, my
passion's as violent as ever; but you would not be so
unreasonable as to have a man love on, when it can
answer no end? It's no better than making him un∣happy
for a joke. There's no sense in such a thing.”</P>
<P>“By the way, my dear Miss Tyrold, and <HI>apropos</HI>
to this Miss Lynmere,” said Mrs. Arlbery, “do tell
me something about Mr. Mandlebert—what is he?—what
does he do always amongst you?”</P>
<P>“He—he!—” cried Camilla, stammering, “he
was a ward of my father's—”</P>
<P>“O, I don't mean all that; but what is hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
style?—his class?—is he agreeable?”</P>
<P>“I believe—he is generally thought so.”</P>
<P>“If he is, do pray, then, draw him into my so∣ciety,
for I am terribly in want of recruits. These
poor gentlemen you see here are very good sort of
men; but they have a trick of sleeping with their
eyes wide open, and fancy all the time they are
awake; and, indeed, I find it hard to persuade them
to the contrary, though I often ask them for their
<PB N="307" REF="116"/>
dreams. By the way, can't you contrive, some or
other amongst you, to make the room a little cooler?”</P>
<P>“Shall I open this window?” said the Major.</P>
<P>“Nay, nay, don't ask me; I had rather bear six
times the heat, than give my own directions: no∣thing
in the world fatigues me so much as telling
stupid people how to set about things. Colonel, don't
you see I have no fan?”</P>
<P>“I'll fetch it directly—have you left it in the
dining-parlour?”</P>
<P>“Do you really think I would not send a footman
at once, if I must perplex myself with all that re∣collection?
My dear Miss Tyrold, did you ever see
any poor people, that pretended at all to walk about,
and mingle with the rest of the world, like living
creatures, so completely lethargic?—'tis really quite
melancholy! I am sure you have good nature enough
to pity them. It requires my utmost ingenuity to
keep them in any employment; and if I left them
to themselves, they would stand before the fire all the
winter, and lounge upon sofas all the summer. And
that indolence of body so entirely unnerves the mind,
that they find as little to say as to do. Upon the
whole, 'tis really a paltry race, the men of the pre∣sent
times. However, as we have got no better, and
as the women are worse, I do all I can to make them
less insufferable to me.”</P>
<P>“And do you really think the women are worse?”
cried Camilla.</P>
<P>“Not in themselves, my dear; but worse to me,
because I cannot possibly take the same liberties with
them. Macdersey, I wish I had my salts.”</P>
<P>“It shall be the happiness of my life to find them,
be they hid where they may; only tell me where I
may have the pleasure to go and look for them.”</P>
<P>“Nay, that's your affair.”</P>
<P>“Why, then, if they are to be found from the
garret to the cellar, be sure I am a dead man, if I
do not bring them you!”</P>
<P>This mode of displaying airs and graces was so per∣fectly
new to Camilla, that the commands issued, and
<PB N="308" REF="117"/>
the obedience paid, were equally amusing to her.
Brought up herself to be contented with whatever
came in her way, in preference either to giving
trouble, or finding fault, the ridiculous, yet playful
wilfulness with which she saw Mrs. Arlbery send
every one upon her errands, yet object to what every
one performed, presented to her a scene of such
whimsical gaiety, that her concern at the accident
which had made her innocently violate her intended
engagement with Edgar, was completely changed
into pleasure, that thus, without any possible self
blame, an acquaintance she had so earnestly desired
was even by necessity established: and she returned
home at night with spirits all revived, and eloquent
in praise of her new favourite.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="35" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Attic Adventures.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Tyrold, according to the system of recreation
which he had settled with his wife, saw with satis∣faction
the pleasure with which Camilla began this
new acquaintance, in the hope it would help to sup∣port
her spirits during the interval of suspense with
regard to the purposes of Mandlebert. Mrs. Arl∣bery
was unknown to him, except by general fame;
which told him she was a woman of reputation as
well as fashion, and that though her manners were
lively, her heart was friendly, and her hand ever
open to charity.</P>
<P>Upon admitting Lionel again to his presence, he
spoke forcibly, though with brevity, upon the cul∣pability
of his conduct. What he had done, he
said, let him colour it to himself with what levity he
might, was not only a robbery, but a robbery of the
most atrocious and unjustifiable class; adding terror
to violation of property, and playing upon the sus∣ceptibility
of the weakness and infirmities, which he
<PB N="309" REF="118"/>
ought to have been the first to have sheltered and
sheathed. Had the action contained no purpose but
a frolic, even then the situation of the object on
whom it fell, rendered it inhuman; but as its aim and
end was to obtain money, it was dishonourable to
his character, and criminal by the laws of his country.
“Yet shudder not more,” continued he, “young
man, at the justice to which they make you amen∣able,
than at having deserved, though you escape it!
From this day, however, I will name it no more.
Feeble must be all I could utter, compared with what
the least reflection must make you feel! Your uncle,
in a broken state of health, is sent abroad: your
mother, though too justly incensed to see you, sa∣crifices
her happiness to serve you!”</P>
<P>Lionel, for a few hours, was in despair after this
harangue; but as they passed away, he strove to
drive it from his mind, persuading himself it was
useless to dwell upon what was irretrievable.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, the following day, made her visit
at Etherington, and invited the two sisters to a break∣fast
she was to give the next morning. Mr. Tyrold,
who with surprise and concern at a coolness so dilatory,
found a second day wearing away without a visit from
Mandlebert, gladly consented to allow of an amuse∣ment,
that might shake from Camilla the pensiveness
into which, at times, he saw her falling.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery had declared she hated ceremony in
the summer; guarded, therefore, by Lionel, the
sisters walked to the Grove. From the little hill they
had again to pass, they observed a group of com∣pany
upon the leads of her house, which were flat,
and balustraded round; and when they presented
themselves at the door, they were met by Major Cer∣wood,
who conducted them to the scene of business.</P>
<P>It was the end of July, and the weather was sul∣try;
but though the height of the place upon which
the present party was collected, gave some freshness
to the air, the heat reflected from the lead would
have been nearly intolerable, had it not been ob∣viated
by an awning, and by matts, in the part where
<PB N="310" REF="119"/>
seats and refreshments were arranged. French horns
and clarinets were played during the repast.</P>
<P>This little entertainment had for motive a young
lady's quitting her boarding school. Miss Dennel,
a niece, by marriage, of Mrs. Arlbery, who, at the
age of fourteen, came to preside at the house and
table of her father, had begged to be felicitated by
her aunt, upon the joyful occasion, with a ball: but
Mrs. Arlbery declared she never gave any entertain∣ments
in which she did not expect to play the prin∣cipal
part herself; and that balls and concerts were
therefore excluded from her list of home diversions.
It was vastly well to see others shine superior, she said,
elsewhere, but she could not be so accommodating as
to perform Nobody under her own roof. She offered
her, however, a breakfast, with full choice of its
cakes and refreshments; which, with leave to six
upon the spot where it should be given, was all the
youthful pleader could obtain.</P>
<P>The Etherington trio met with a reception the
most polite, and Camilla was distinguished by marks
of peculiar favour. Few guests were added to the
party she had met there before, except the young
lady who was its present foundress; and whose voice
she recollected to have heard, in the enquiries which
had reached her ear from within the paddock.</P>
<P>Miss Dennel was a pretty, blooming, tall girl,
but as childish in intellect as in experience; though
self-persuaded she was a woman in both, since she
was called from school to fit at the head of her
father's table.</P>
<P>Camilla required nothing further for entertainment
than to listen to her new friend; Lavinia, though
more amazed than amused, always modestly hung
back as a mere looker on; and the company in ge∣neral
made their diversion from viewing, through
various glasses, the seats of the neighbouring gentle∣men,
and re-viewing, with yet more scrutiny, their
characters and circumstances. But Lionel, ever rest∣less,
seized the opportunity to patrole the attic re∣gions
of the house, where, meeting with a capacious
<PB N="311" REF="120"/>
lumber room, he returned to assure the whole party
it would make an admirable theatre, and to ask who
would come forth to spout with him.</P>
<P>Mr. Macdersey said, he did not know one word
of any part, but he could never refuse any thing that
might contribute to the company's pleasure.</P>
<P>Away they sped together, and in a few minutes
reversed the face of every thing. Old sofas, bed∣steads,
and trunks, large family chests, deal boxes
and hampers, carpets and curtains rolled up for the
summer, tables with two legs, and chairs without
bottoms, were truckled from the middle to one end
of the room, and arranged to form a semi-circle,
with seats in front<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for a pit. Carpets were then
uncovered and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to be spread for the stage,
and curtains, with as little mercy, were unfurled,
and hung up to make a scene.</P>
<P>They then applied to Miss Dennel, who had fol∣lowed
to peep at what they were about, and asked
if she thought the audience might be admitted.</P>
<P>She declared she had never seen any place so neat
and elegant in her life.</P>
<P>Such an opinion could not but be decisive; and
they prepared to re-ascend; when the sight of a
small door, near the entrance of the large apartment,
excited the ever ready curiosity of Lionel, who,
though the key was on the outside, contrived to turn
it wrong; but while endeavouring to rectify by force
what he had spoilt by aukwardness, a sudden noise
from within startled them all, and occasioned quick
and reiterated screams from Miss Dennel, who, with
the utmost velocity burst back upon the company on
the leads, calling out; “O Lord! how glad I am
I'm come back alive! Mr. Macdersey and young
Mr Tyrold are very likely killed! for they've just
found I don't know how many robbers shut up in a
dark closet!”</P>
<P>The gentlemen waited for no explanation to this
unintelligible story, but hastened to the spot; and
Mrs. Arlbery ordered all the servants who were in
waiting to follow and assist.</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="121"/>
Miss Dennel then entreated to have the trap door
through which they ascended, from a small stair case,
to the leads, double locked till the gentlemen should
declare upon their honours that the thieves were all
dead.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery would not listen to this, but waited
with Lavinia and Camilla the event.</P>
<P>The gentlemen, meanwhile, reached the scene of
action, at the moment when Macdersey, striking
first his foot, and then his whole person against the
door, had forced it open with such sudden violence,
that he fell over a pail of water into the adjoining
room.</P>
<P>The servants arriving at the same time, announced
that this was merely a closet for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> brooms, and
pails, belonging to the house maid: and it appeared,
upon examination, that the noise from within, had
simply been produced by the falling down of a broom,
occasioned by their shaking the door in endeavouring
to force the lock.</P>
<P>The Ensign, wetted or splashed all over, was in a
fury; and, turning to Lionel, who laughed voci∣ferously,
whilst the rest of the gentlemen were scarce
less moderate, and the servants joined in the chorus,
peremptorily demanded to know if he had put the
pail there on purpose; “In which case, Sir,” said
he, “you must never let me see you laugh again to
the longest hour you have to live!”</P>
<P>“My good Macdersey,” said the General, “go
into another room, and have your cloaths wiped and
dried; it will be time enough then to settle who shall
laugh longest.”</P>
<P>“General,” said he, “I scorn to mind being
either wet or dry; a soldier ought to be above such
delicate effeminacy: it is not, therefore, the sousing
I regard, provided I can once be clear it was not
done for a joke.”</P>
<P>Lionel, when he could speak, declared, that far
from placing the pail there on purpose, he had not
known there was such a closet in the house, nor had
<PB N="313" REF="122"/>
ever been up those stairs till they all mounted them
together.</P>
<P>“I am perfectly satisfied, then, my good friend,”
said the Ensign, shaking him by the hand with an
heartiness that gave him no small share of the pail's
contents; “when a gentleman tells me a thing se∣riously,
I make it a point to believe him; especially
if he has a good honest countenance, that assures me
he would not refuse me satisfaction, in the case he
had meant to make game of me.”</P>
<P>“And do you always terminate your jests with
the ceremony of a tilting match?” cried Sir Sedley.</P>
<P>“Yes, Sir! if I'm made a joke of by a man of
any honour. For, to tell you a piece of my mind,
there's no one thing upon earth I hate like a joke;
unless it's against another person; and then it only
gives me a little joy inwardly; for I make it a point
of complaisance not to laugh out: except where I
happen to wish for a little private conversation with
the person that gives me the diversion.”</P>
<P>“Facetious in the extreme!” cried Sir Sedley,
“an infallibly excellent mode to make a man die of
laughter? Droll to the utmost!”</P>
<P>“With regard to that, Sir, I have no objection
to a little wit or humour, provided a person has the
politeness to laugh only at himself, and his own par∣ticular
friends and relations; but if once he takes
the liberty to turn me into ridicule, I look upon it
as an affront, and expect the proper reparation.”</P>
<P>“O, to refuse that would be without bowels to a
degree!”</P>
<P>Lionel now ran up stairs, to beg the ladies would
come and see the theatre; but suddenly exclaimed,
as he looked around, “Ah ha!” and hastily gal∣loped
down, and to the bottom of the house. Mrs.
Arlbery descended with her young party, and the
ensign, in mock heroics, solemnly prostrated himself
to Miss Dennel, pouring into her delighted ears,
from various shreds and scraps of different tragedies,
the most high flown and egregiously ill adapted com∣pliments:
while the Major, less absurdly, though
<PB N="314" REF="123"/>
scarce less passionately, made Camilla his Juliet, and
whispered the tenderest lines of Romeo.</P>
<P>Lionel presently running, out of breath, up stairs
again, cried: “Mrs. Arlbery, I have drawn you
in a new beau.”</P>
<P>“Have you?” cried she, coolly; “why then I
permit you to draw him out again. Had you told
me he had forced himself in, you had made him
welcome. But I foster only willing slaves. So off,
if you please, with your boast and your beau.”</P>
<P>“I can't, upon my word, ma'am, for he is at
my heels.”</P>
<P>Mandlebert, at the same moment, not hearing
what passed, made his appearance.</P>
<P>The surprised and always unguarded Camilla, ut∣tered
an involuntary exclamation, which instantly
catching his ear, drew his eye towards the exclaimer,
and there fixed it; with an astonishment which sus∣pended
wholly his half made bow, and beginning
address to Mrs. Arlbery.</P>
<P>Lionel had descried him upon the little hill before
the house; where, as he was passing on, his own at∣tention
had been caught by the sound of horns and
clarinets, just as, without any explanation, Lionel
flew to tell him he was wanted, and almost forced
him off his horse, and up the stairs.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, in common with those who dispense
with all forms for themselves, exacted them punc∣tiliously
from all others. The visit therefore of Man∣dlebert
not being designed for her, afforded her at
first no gratification, and produced rather a contrary
feeling, when she observed the total absence of all
pleasure in the surprise with which he met Camilla
at her house. She gave him a reception of cold ci∣vility,
and then chatted almost wholly with the Ge∣neral,
or Sir Sedley.</P>
<P>Edgar scarce saw whether he was received or not;
his bow was mechanical, his apology for his intru∣sion
was unintelligible. Amazement at seeing Ca∣milla
under this roof, disappointment at her breach
of implied promise, and mortification at the air of
<PB N="315" REF="124"/>
being at home, which he thought he remarked in
her situation, though at an acquaintance he had
taken so much pains to keep aloof from her, all
conspired to displease and perplex him; and though
his eyes could with difficulty look any other way, he
neither spoke to nor approached her.</P>
<P>Nor was even thus meeting her all he had to give
him disturbance; the palpable devoirs of Major Cer∣wood
incensed as well as astonished him; for, under
pretext of only following the humour of the day, in
affecting to act the hero in love, the Major assailed
her, without reserve, with declarations of his pas∣sion,
which though his words passed off as quotations,
his looks and manner made appropriate. How, al∣ready,
thought Edgar, has he obtained such a pri∣vilege?
such confidence? To have uttered one such
sentence, my tongue would have trembled, my lips
would have quivered!</P>
<P>Camilla felt confounded by his presence, from the
consciousness of the ill opinion she must excite by
this second apparent disregard of a given engage∣ment.
She would fain have explained to him it's
history; but she could not free herself from the
Major, whose theatrical effusions were not now to be
repressed, since, at first, she had unthinkingly at∣tended
to them.</P>
<P>Lionel joined with Macdersey in directing similar
heroics to Miss Dennel, who, simply enchanted,
called out: “I'm determined when I've a house of
my own, I'll have just such a room as this at the
top of it, on purpose to act a play every night.”</P>
<P>“And when, my dear,” said Mrs. Arlbery,
“do you expect to have a house of your own?”</P>
<P>“O, as soon as I am married, you know.”</P>
<P>“Is your marrying, then, already decided?”</P>
<P>“Dear no, not that I know of, aunt. I'm sure
I never trouble myself about it; only I suppose it
will happen some day or other.”</P>
<P>“And when it does, you are very sure your hus∣band
will approve your acting plays every night?”</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="125"/>
“O, as to that, I shan't ask him. Whenever
I'm married I'll be my own mistress, that I'm re∣solved
upon. But papa's so monstrous cross, he says
he won't let me act plays now.”</P>
<P>“Papas and mamas,” cried Sir Sedley, “are
ever most egregiously in the way. 'Tis prodigiously
surprising they have never yet been banished society. I
know no mark more irrefragable of the supineness
of mankind.”</P>
<P>Then rising, and exclaiming: “What savage
heat! I wish the weather had a little feeling!” he
broke up the party by ordering his curricle, and
being the first to depart.</P>
<P>“That creature,” cried Mrs. Arlbery, “if one
had the least care for him, is exactly an animal to
drive one mad! He labours harder to be affected
than any ploughman does for his dinner. And,
completely as his conceit obscures it, he has every
endowment nature can bestow, except common
sense!”</P>
<P>They now all descended to take leave, except the
Ensign and Lionel, who went, arm in arm, prowling
about, to view all the garrets, followed on tip-toe
by Miss Dennel. Lavinia called vainly after her
brother; but Camilla, hoping every instant she
might clear her conduct to Edgar, was not sorry to
be detained.</P>
<P>They had not, however, been five minutes in the
parlour, before a violent and angry noise from above,
induced them all to remount to the top of the house;
and there, upon entering a garret whence it issued,
they saw Miss Dennel, decorated with the Ensign's
cocked hat and feather, yet looking pale with fright;
Lionel accoutred in the maid's cloaths, and almost
in a convulsio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of laughter; and Mac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rsey, in a
rage utterly incomprehensible, with the coachman's
large bob-wig <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anging loose upon his head.</P>
<P>It was some time before it was possible to gather,
that having all p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raded into various garrets, in search
of adventures, Lionel, after attiring himself in the
maid's gown, cap, and apron, had suddenly depo∣sited
<PB N="317" REF="126"/>
upon Miss Dennel's head the Ensign's cocked
hat, replacing it with the coachman's best wig upon
the toupee of Macdersey; whose resentment was so
violent at this liberty, that it was still some minutes
before he could give it articulation.</P>
<P>The effect of this full buckled bob-jerom, which
stuck hollow from the young face and powdered locks
of the Ensign, was irresistibly ludicrous; yet he would
have deemed it a greater indignity to take it quietly
off, than to be viewed in it by thousands; though
when he saw the disposition of the whole company <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
sympathise with Lionel, his wrath rose yet higher,
and s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amping with passion, he fiercely, said to him—
“Take it off, Sir!—take it off my head!”</P>
<P>Lionel, holding this too imperious a command to
be obeyed, only shouted louder. Macdersey then,
incensed beyond endurance, lowered his voice with
stifled choler, and putting his arms akimbo, said—
“If you take me for a fool, Sir, I shall demand sa∣tisfaction;
for it's what I never put up with!”</P>
<P>Then, turning to the rest, he solemnly added—
“I beg pardon of all the worthy company for speak∣ing
this little whisper, which certainly I should scorn
to do before ladies, if it had not been a secret.”</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, alarmed at the serious consequences
now threatening this folly, said—“No, no; I allow
of no secrets in my house, but what are entrusted to
myself. I insist, therefore, upon being umpire in
this cause.”</P>
<P>“Madam,” said Macdersey, “I hope never to
become such a debased brute of the creation, as to
contradict the commands of a fair lady▪ except when
it's upon a point of honour. But I can't consent to
pass for a fool; and still more not for a poltroon—
You'll excuse the little hint.”</P>
<P>Then, while making a profound and ceremonious
bow, his wig fell over his head on the ground.</P>
<P>“This is very unlucky,” cried he, with a look of
vexation; “for certainly, and to be sure no human
mortal should have made me take it off myself, before
I was righted.”</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="127"/>
Camilla, picking it up, to render the affair merely
burlesque, pulled off the maid's cap from her bro∣ther's
head, and put on the wig in its place, saying
—“There, Lionel, you have played the part of
<HI>Lady Wrong Head</HI> long enough; be so good now as
to perform that of <HI>Sir Francis.</HI>”</P>
<P>This ended the business, and the whole party, in
curricles, on horseback, or on foot, departed from
the Grove.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="36" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A few Explanations.</HEAD>
<P>THE last words of Dr. Marchmont, in taking
leave of Edgar, were injunctions to circumspection,
and representations of the difficulty of drawing back
with honour, if once any incautious eagerness be∣trayed
his partiality. To this counsel he was im∣pelled
to submit, lest he should risk for Camilla a re∣port
similar to that which for Indiana had given him
so much disturbance. There, indeed, he felt him∣self
wholly blameless. His admiration was but such
as he always experienced at sight of a beautiful pic∣ture,
nor had it ever been demonstrated in any more
serious manner. He had distinguished her by no par∣ticular
attention, singled her out by no pointed ad∣dress,
taken no pains to engage her good opinion,
and manifested no flattering pleasure at her approach
or presence.</P>
<P>His sense of right was too just to mislead him into
giving himself similar absolution with respect to Ca∣milla.
He had never, indeed, indulged a voluntary
vent to his preference; but the candour of his cha∣racter
convinced him that what so forcibly he had
felt, he must occasionally have betrayed. Yet the
idea excited regret without remorse; for though it
had been his wish, as well as intention, to conceal
<PB N="319" REF="128"/>
his best hopes, till they were ratified by his judg∣ment,
he had the conscious integrity of knowing
that, should her heart become his prize, his dearest
view in life would be to solicit her hand.</P>
<P>To preserve, therefore, the appearance of an un∣designing
friend of the house, he had forced himself
to refrain, for two days, from any visit to the rec∣tory,
whither he was repairing, when thus, un∣looked
and unwished for, he surprized Camilla at the
Grove.</P>
<P>Disappointed and disapproving feelings kept him,
while there, aloof from her; by continual sugges∣tions,
that her charact<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r was of no stability, that
Dr. Marchmont was right in his doubts, and Miss
Margland herself not wrong in accusing her of ca∣price;
and when he perceived, upon her preparing
to walk home with her brother and sister, that Ma∣jor
Cerwood stept forward to attend her, he indig∣nantly
resolved to arrange without delay his conti∣nental
excursion. But again, when, as she quitted
the room, he saw he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> head half turned round, with
an eye of enquiry if he followed, he determined
frankly, and at on<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in his capacity of a friend, to
request some explan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion of this meeting.</P>
<P>The assiduities o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Major made it difficult to
speak to her; but t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> aid of her desire for a conver∣sation,
which was equally anxious, and less guarded
than his own, anticipated his principal investigation,
by urging her, voluntarily to seize an opportunity
of relating to him the history of her first visit to
Mrs. Arlbery; and of assuring him that the second
was indispensably its consequence.</P>
<P>Softened by this apparent earnestness for his good
opinion, all his interest and all his tenderness for her
returned; and though much chagrined at the acci∣dent,
or rather mischief, which had thus established
the acquaintance, he had too little to say, whatever
he had to feel, of positive weight against it, to pro∣pose
its now being relinquished. He thanked her
impressively for so ready an explanation; and then
gently added; “I know your predilection in favour
<PB N="320" REF="129"/>
of this lady, and I will say nothing to disturb it;
but as she is yet new to you, and as all residence, all
intercourse, from your own home or relations, is new
to you also—tell me, candidly, sincerely tell me, can
you condescend to suffer an old friend, though in the
person of but a young man, to offer you, from time
to time, a hint, a little counsel, a few brief words
of occasional advice? and even, perhaps, now and
then, to torment you into a little serious reflec∣tion?”</P>
<P>“If you,” cried she, gaily, “will give me the
reflection, I promise, to the best of my power, to
give you in return, the seriousness; but I can by no
means engage for both!”</P>
<P>“O, never, but from your own prudence,” he
answered, gratefully, “may your delightful vivacity
know a curb! If now I seem myself to fear it, it is
not from moroseness, it is not from insensibility to
its charm—”</P>
<P>He was stopt here by Macdersey, who, suddenly
overtaking him, entreated an immediate short con∣ference
upon a matter of moment.</P>
<P>Though cruelly vexed by the interruption, he
could not refuse to turn back with him; and Ca∣milla
again was left wholly to the gallant Major; but
her heart felt so light that she had thus cleared her∣self
to Edgar, so gratified by his request to become
himself her monitor, and so enchanted to find her
acquaintance with Mrs. Arlbery no longer disputed,
that she was too happy to admit any vexation; and
the Major had never thought her so charming, though
of the Major she thought not one moment.</P>
<P>Macdersey, with a long, ceremonious, and not
very clear apology, confessed he had called Mandle∣bert
aside only to enquire into the certain truth, if it
were not a positive secret, of his intended nuptials
with the beautiful Miss Lynmere. Mandlebert,
with surprize, but without any hesitation, declared
himself wholly without any pretensions to that lady.
Macdersey then embraced him, and they parted mu∣tually
satisfied.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="130"/>
It seemed now too late to Mandlebert to go to
Etherington till the next day, whither, as soon as
he had breakfasted, he then rode.</P>
<P>According to his general custom, he went imme∣diately
to the study, where he met with a calm, but
kind reception from Mr. Tyrold; and after half an
hour's conversation, upon Lisbon, Dr. Marchmont,
and Mrs. Tyrold, he left him to seek his young
friends.</P>
<P>In the parlour, he found Lavinia alone; but be∣fore
he could enquire for her sister, who was acciden∣tally
up stairs, Lionel, just dismounted from his
horse, appeared.</P>
<P>“O, ho, Edgar!” cried he, “you are here, are
you? this would make fine confusion, if that beauty
of nature, Miss Margland, should happen to call.
They've just sent for you to Beech Park. I don't
know what's to be done to you; but if you have
any inclination to save poor Camilla's eyes, or cap, at
least, from that meek, tender creature, you'll set off
for Cleves before they know you are in this house.”</P>
<P>Edgar amazed, desired an explanation; but he
protested the wrath of Miss Margland had been so
comical, and given him▪ so much diversion, that he
had not been able to get at any particulars; he only
knew there was a great commotion, and that Edgar
was declared in love with some of his sisters or cou∣sins,
and Miss Margland was in a rage that it was
not with herself; and that, in short, because he
only happened to drop a hint of the latter notion,
that delectable paragon had given him so violent a
blow with her fine eyes, that in order to vent an un∣governable
sit of laughter, without the risk of having
the house pulled about his ears, he had hastily
mounted his horse, and galloped off.</P>
<P>The contempt of Edgar for Miss Margland would
have made him disdain another question, if the
name of Camilla had not been mingled in this rela∣tion;
no question, however, could procure further
information. Lionel, enchanted that he had tor∣mented
Miss Margland, understood nothing more of
<PB N="322" REF="131"/>
the matter, and could only repeat his own merry
sayings, and their effect.</P>
<P>Lavinia expressed, most innocently, her curiosity
to know what this meant; and was going for Ca∣milla,
to assist in some conjecture; but Edgar, who
by this strange story had lost his composure, felt un∣equal
to hearing it discussed in her presence, and,
pleading sudden haste, rode away.</P>
<P>He did not, however, go to Cleves; he hardly
knew if Lionel had not amused him with a feigned
story; but he no sooner arrived at Beech Park, than
he found a message from Sir Hugh, begging to see
him with all speed.</P>
<P>The young Ensign was the cause of this present
summons and disturbance. Elated by the declara∣tion
of Mandlebert, that the rumour of his contract
was void of foundation, and buoyed up by Mrs.
Arlbery, to whom he returned with the communica∣tion,
he resolved to make his advances in form. He
presented himself, therefore, at Cleves, where he
asked an audience of Sir Hugh, and at once, with
his accustomed vehemence, declared himself bound
eternally, life and soul, to his fair niece, Miss Lyn∣mere;
and desired that, in order to pay his addresses
to her, he might be permitted to see her at odd
times, when he was off duty.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh was scarce able to understand him, from
his volubility, and the extravagance of his phrases
and gestures; but he imputed them to his violent
passion, and therefore answered him with great gen∣tleness,
assuring him he did not mean to doubt his
being a proper alliance for his niece, though he had
never heard of him before; but begging he would
not be affronted if he could not accept him, not
knowing yet quite clearly if she were not engaged to
a young gentleman in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>The Ensign now loudly proclaimed his own news:
Mandlebert had protested himself free, and the
whole county already rang with the mistake.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, who always at a loss how to say no,
thought this would have been a good answer, now
<PB N="323" REF="132"/>
sent for Miss Margland, and desired her to speak
herself with the young gentleman.</P>
<P>Miss Margland, much gratified, asked Macdersey
if she could look at his rent roll.</P>
<P>He had nothing of the kind at hand, he said, not
being yet come to his estate, which was in Ireland,
and was still the property of a first cousin, who was
not yet dead.</P>
<P>Miss Margland, promising he should have an an∣swer
in a few days, then dismissed him; but more
irritated than ever against Mandlebert, from the con∣trast
of his power to make settlements, she burst
forth into her old declarations of his ill usage of
Miss Lynmere; attributing it wholly to the contriv∣ances
of Camilla, whom she had herself, she said,
surprized wheedling Edgar into her snares, when
she called last at Etherington; and who, she doubt∣ed
not, they should soon hear was going to be mar∣ried
to him.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh always understood literally whatever
was said; these assertions therefore of ill humour,
merely made to vent black bile, affected him deeply
for the honour and welfare of Camilla, and he hastily
sent a messenger for Edgar, determining to beg, if
that were the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, he would openly own the whole,
and not leave all the blame to fall all upon his poor
niece.</P>
<P>At this period, Lionel had called, and, by in∣flaming
Miss Margland, had aggravated the general
disturbance.</P>
<P>When Edgar arrived, Sir Hugh told him of the
affair, assuring him he should never have taken amiss
his preferring Camilla, which he thought but natu∣ral,
if he had only done it from the first.</P>
<P>Edgar, though easily through all this he saw the
malignant yet shallow offices of Miss Margland,
found himself, with infinite vexation, compelled to
declare off equally from both the charges; consci∣ous,
that till the very moment of his proposals, he
must appear to have no preference nor designs. He
spoke, therefore, with the utmost respect of the
<PB N="324" REF="133"/>
young ladies, but again said it was uncertain if he
should not travel before he formed any establishment.</P>
<P>The business thus explicitly decided, nothing more
could be done: but Miss Margland was somewhat
appeased, when she heard that her pupil was not so
disgracefully to be supplanted.</P>
<P>Indiana herself, to whom Edgar had never seemed
agreeable, soon forgot she had ever thought of him;
and elated by the acquisition of a new lover, doubted
not, but, in a short time, the publication of her li∣berty
would prove slavery to all mankind.</P>
<P>Early the next morning, the carriage of Sir Hugh
arrived at the rectory for Camilla. She never re∣fused
an invitation from her uncle, but she felt so
little equal to passing a whole day in the presence of
Miss Margland, after the unaccountable, yet alarm∣ing
relation she had gathered from Lionel, that she
entreated him to accompany her, and to manage that
she should return with him as soon as the horses were
fed and rested.</P>
<P>Lionel, ever good humoured, and ready to oblige,
willingly complied; but demanded that she should
go with him, in their way back, to see a new house
which he wanted to examine.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh received her with his usual affection, In∣diana
with indifference, and Miss Margland with a
malicious smile: but Eugenia, soon taking her aside,
disclosed to her that Edgar, the day before, had
publicly and openly disclaimed any views upon In∣diana,
and had declared himself without any passion
whatever, and free from all inclination or intention
but to travel.</P>
<P>The blush of pleasure, with which Camilla heard
the first sentence of this speech, became the tingle of
shame at the second, and whitened into surprise and
sorrow at the last.</P>
<P>Eugenia, though she saw some disturbance, under∣stood
not these changes. Early absorbed in the study
of literature and languages, under the direction of a
preceptor who had never mingled with the world,
her capacity had been occupied in constant work for
<PB N="325" REF="134"/>
her memory; but her judgment and penetration had
been wholly unexercised. Like her uncle, she con∣cluded
every body, and every thing to be precisely
what they appeared; and though, in that given point
of view, she had keener intellects to discern, and
more skill to appreciate persons and characters, she
was as unpractised as himself in those discriminative
powers, which dive into their own conceptions to
discover the latent springs, the multifarious and con∣tradictory
sources of human actions and propensities.</P>
<P>Upon their return to the company, Miss Margland
chose to relate the history herself. Mr. Mandlebert,
she said, had not only thought proper to acknow∣ledge
his utter insensibility to Miss Lynmere, but
had declared his indifference for every woman under
the sun, and protested he held them all cheap alike.
“So I would advise nobody,” she continued, “to
flatter themselves with making a conquest of him,
for they may take my word for it, he won't be caught
very easily.”</P>
<P>Camilla disdained to understand this but in a ge∣neral
sense, and made no answer. Indiana, pouting
her lip, said she was sure she did not want to catch
him: she did not fear having offers enough without
him, if she should happen to chuse to marry.</P>
<P>“Certainly,” said Miss Margland, “there's no
doubt of that;” and this young officer's coming the
very moment he heard of your being at liberty, is a
proof that the only reason of your having had no
more proposals, is owing to Mr. Mandlebert. So I
don't speak for you, but for any body else, that may
suppose they may please the difficult gentleman
better.</P>
<P>Camilla now breathed hard with resentment; but
still was silent, and Indiana answering only for her∣self,
said: “O, yes! I can't say I'm much fright∣ened.
I dare say if Mr. Melmond had known, . . .
but he thought like every body else . . . however,
I'm sure, I'm very glad of it, only I wish he had
spoke a little sooner, for I suppose Mr. Melmond
thinks me as much out of his reach as if I was mar∣ried
<PB N="326" REF="135"/>
Not that I care about it; only it's provok∣ing.”</P>
<P>“No, my dear,” said Miss Margland, “it would
be quite below your dignity to think about him, with∣out
knowing better who he is, or what are his ex∣pectations
and connexions. As to this young officer,
I shall take proper care to make enquiries, before he
has his answer. He belongs to a very good family;
for he's related to Lord O'Lerney, and I have friends
in Ireland who can acquaint me with his situation and
fortune. There's time enough to look about you;
only as Mr. Mandlebert has behaved so unhand∣somely,
I hope none of the family will give him their
countenance. I am sure it will be to no purpose, if
any body should think of doing it by way of having
any design upon him. It will be lost labour, I can
tell them.”</P>
<P>“As to that, I am quite easy,” said Indiana,
tossing her head, “any body is welcome to him for
me;—my cousin, or any body else.”</P>
<P>Camilla, now, absolutely called upon to speak,
with all the spirit she could assume, said, “With
regard to me, there is no occasion to remind me how
much I am out of the question; yet suffer me to say,
respect for myself would secure me from forming such
plans as you surmise, if no other sense of propriety
could save me from such humiliation.”</P>
<P>“Now, my dear, you speak properly,” said Miss
Margland, taking her hand; “and I hope you will
have the spirit to shew him you care no more for him
than he cares for you.”</P>
<P>“I hope so too,” answered Camilla, turning pale;
“but I don't suppose—I can't imagine—that it is
very likely he should have mentioned any thing good
or bad—with regard to his care for me?”</P>
<P>This was painfully uttered, but from a curiosity
irrepressible.</P>
<P>“As to that, my dear, don't deceive yourself;
for the question was put home to him very properly,
th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> you might know what you had to expect, and
not keep off other engagements from a false notion.”</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="136"/>
“This indeed,” said Camilla, colouring with in∣dignation,
“this has been a most useless, a most
causeless enquiry!”</P>
<P>“I am very glad you treat the matter as it de∣serves,
for I like to see young ladies behave with
dignity.”</P>
<P>“And pray, then, what—was there any—did he
make—was there any—any answer—to this—to—.”</P>
<P>“O, yes, he answered without any great cere∣mony,
I can assure you! He said, in so many words,
that he thought no more of you than of your cousin,
and was going abroad to divert and amuse himself,
better than by entering into marriage with either one
or other of you; or with any body else.”</P>
<P>Camilla felt half killed by this answer; and pre∣sently
quitting the room, ran out into the garden,
and to a walk far from the house, before she had
power to breathe, or recollection to be aware of the
sensibility she was betraying.</P>
<P>She then as hastily went back, secretly resolving
never more to think of him, and to shew both to
himself and to the world, by every means in her power,
her perfect indifference.</P>
<P>She could not, however, endure to encounter Miss
Margland again, but called for Lionel, and begged
him to hurry the coachman.</P>
<P>Lionel complied—she took a hasty leave of her
uncle, and only saying, “Good by, good by!” to
the rest, made her escape.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, ever unsuspicious, thought her merely
afraid to detain her brother; but Eugenia, calm, af∣fectionate,
and divested of cares for herself, saw evi∣dently
that something was wrong, though she divined
not what, and entreated leave to go with her sister to
Etherington, and thence to return, without keeping
out the horses.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh was well pleased, and the two sisters and
Lionel set off together.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Specimens of Taste.</HEAD>
<P>THE presence of Lionel stifled the enquiries of
Eugenia; and pride, all up in arms, absorbed every
softer feeling in Camilla.</P>
<P>When they had driven half a mile, “Now, young
ladies,” said he, “I shall treat you with a frolic.”
He then stopt the carriage, and told the coachman
to drive to Cornfield; saying, “Tis but two miles
about, and Coachy won't mind that; will you
Coachy?”</P>
<P>The coachman, looking forward to half a crown,
said his horses would be all the better for a little
more exercise; and Jacob, familiarly fond of Lionel
from a boy, made no difficulty.</P>
<P>Lionel desired his sisters to ask no questions, assur∣ing
them he had great designs, and a most agreeable
surprise in view for them.</P>
<P>In pursuance of his directions, they drove on till
they came before a small house, just new fronted with
deep red bricks, containing, on the ground floor, two
little bow windows, in a sharp triangular form, en∣closing
a door ornamented with small panes of glass,
cut in various shapes; on the first story, a little bal∣cony,
decorated in the middle and at each corner
with leaden images of Cupids; and, in the attic
story, a very small venetian window, partly formed
with minute panes of glass, and partly with glazed
tiles; representing, in blue and white, various de∣vices
of dogs and cats, mice and birds, rats and fer∣rets,
as emblems of the conjugal state.</P>
<P>“Well, young ladies, what say you to this?”
cried he, “does it hit your fancy? If it does, 'tis
your own!”</P>
<P>Eugenia asked what he meant.</P>
<P>“Mean? to make a present of it to which ever is
the best girl, and can first cry bo! to a goose. Come,
<PB N="329" REF="138"/>
don't look disdainfully. Eugenia, what say you?
won't it be better to be mistress of this little neat,
tight, snug box, and a pretty little tidy husband,
that belongs to it, than to pore all day long over a
latin theme with old Dr. Orkborne? I have often
thought my poor uncle was certainly out of his wits,
when he set us all, men, women, and children, to
learn Latin, or else be whipt by the old doctor. But
we all soon got our necks out of the collar, except
poor Eugenia, and she's had to work for us all.
However, here's an opportunity—see but what a
pretty place—not quite finished, to be sure, but
look at that lake? how cool, how rural, how re∣freshing!”</P>
<P>“Lake?” repeated Eugenia, “I see nothing but
a very dirty little pond, with a mass of rubbish in
the middle. Indeed I see nothing else but rubbish
all round, and every where.”</P>
<P>“That's the very beauty of the thing, my dear;
it's all in the exact state for being finished under your
own eye, and according to your own taste.”</P>
<P>“To whom does it belong?”</P>
<P>“It's uninhabited yet; but it's preparing for a
very spruce young spark, that I advise you both to
set your caps at. Hold! I see somebody peeping;
I'll go and get some news for you.”</P>
<P>He then jumped from the coach, and ran up five
deep narrow steps, formed of single large rough stones,
which mounted so much above the threshold of the
house, that upon opening the door, there appeared
a stool to assist all comers to reach the floor of the
passage.</P>
<P>Eugenia, with some curiosity, looked out, and
saw her brother, after nearly forcing his entrance,
speak to a very mean little man, dressed in old dirty
cloaths, who seemed willing to hide himself behind
the door, but whom he almost dragged forward, say∣ing
aloud, “O, I can take no excuse, I insist upon
your shewing the house. I have brought two young
ladies on purpose to see it; and who knows but one
<PB N="330" REF="139"/>
of them may take a fancy to it, and make you a
happy man for life.”</P>
<P>“As to that, Sir,” said the man, still endeavour∣ing
to retreat, “I can't say as I've quite made my
mind up yet as to the marriage ceremony. I've
known partly enough of the state already; but if
ever I marry again, which is a moot point, I sha'n't
do it hand over head, like a boy, without knowing
what I'm about. However, it's time enough o'con∣science
to think of that, when my house is done, and
my workmen is off my hands.”</P>
<P>Camilla now, by the language and the voice, ga∣thered
that this was Mr. Dubster.</P>
<P>“Pho, pho,” answered Lionel, “you must not
he so hard-hearted when fair ladies are in the case.
Besides, one of them is that pretty girl you flirted
with at Northwick. She's a sister of mine, and I
shall take it very ill if you don't hand her out of the
coach, and do the honours of your place to her.”</P>
<P>Camilla, much provoked, earnestly called to her
brother, but utterly in vain.</P>
<P>“Lauk-a-day! why it is not half finished,” said
Mr. Dubster; “nor a quarter neither: and as to
that young lady, I can't say as it was much in my
mind to be over civil to her any more, begging par∣don,
after her giving me the slip in that manner.
I can't say as I think it was over and above handsome,
letting me get my gloves. Not that I mind it in
the least, as to that.”</P>
<P>“Pho, pho, man, you must never bear malice
against a fair lady. Besides, she's come now on pur∣pose
to make her excuses.”</P>
<P>“O, that's another thing; if the young lady's
sorry, I sha'n't think of holding out. Besides, I
can't say but what I thought her agreeable enough,
if it had not been for her behaving so comical just
at the last. Not that I mean in the least to make
any complaint, by way of getting of the young lady
scolded.”</P>
<P>“You must make friends now, man, and think
no more of it;” cried Lionel, who would have drawn
<PB N="331" REF="140"/>
him to the carriage; but he protested he was quite
ashamed to be seen in such a disabille, and should go
first and dress himself. Lionel, on the contrary, de∣claring
nothing so manly, nor so becoming, as a ne∣glect
of outward appearance, pulled him to the
coach door, notwithstanding all his efforts to disen∣gage
himself, and the most bashful distortions with
which he strove to sneak behind his conductor.</P>
<P>“Ladies,” said he, “Mr. Dubster desires to have
the honour of walking over his house and grounds
with you.”</P>
<P>Camilla declared she had no time to alight; but
Lionel insisted, and soon forced them both from the
coach.</P>
<P>Mr. Dubster, no longer stiff, starched, and proud,
as when full dressed, was sunk into the smallest in∣significance;
and when they were compelled to enter
his grounds, through a small Chinese gate, painted
of a deep blue, would entirely have kept out of
sight; but for a whisper from Lionel, that the ladies
had owned they thought he looked to particular ad∣vantage
in that careless attire.</P>
<P>Encouraged by this, he came boldly forward, and
suddenly facing them, made a low bow saying:
“Young ladies, your humble.”</P>
<P>They courtsied slightly, and Camilla said she was
very sorry to break in upon him.</P>
<P>“O, it don't much matter,” cried he, extremely
pleased by this civility, “I only hope, young ladies,
you won't take umbrage at my receiving you in this
pickle; but you've popt upon me unawares, as one
may say. And my best coat is at this very minute at
Tom Hicks's, nicely packed and papered up, and tied
all round, in a drawer of his, up stairs in his room.
And I'd have gone for it with the greatest pleasure
in life, to shew my respect, if the young gentleman
would have let me.”</P>
<P>“And then,” recollecting Eugenia, “Good lauk,
ma'am,” said he, in a low voice to Camilla, “that's
that same lame little lady as I saw at the ball?”</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="141"/>
“That lady, Sir,” answered she, provoked, “is
my sister.”</P>
<P>“Mercy's me!” exclaimed he, lifting up his
hands, “I wish I'd known as much at the time.
I'm sure, ma'am, if I'd thought the young lady
was any ways related to you, I would not have said
a word disrespectful upon no account.”</P>
<P>Lionel asked how long he had had this place.</P>
<P>“Only a little while. I happened of it quite
lucky. A friend of mine was just being turned out
of it, in default of payment, and so I got it a bar∣gain.
I intend to fit it up a little in taste, and then,
whether I like it or no, I can always let it.”</P>
<P>They were now, by Lionel, dragged into the
house, which was yet unfurnished, half papered, and
half white washed. The workmen, Mr. Dubster
said, were just gone to dinner, and he rejoiced that
they had happened to come so conveniently, when
he should be no loser by leaving <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to them∣selves,
in order to oblige the young ladies with his
company.</P>
<P>He insisted upon shewing them not only every
room, but every closet, every cupboard, every <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook,
corner, and hiding place; praising their utility, and
enumerating all their possible appropriations, with
the most minute encomiums.</P>
<P>“But I'm quite sorry,” cried he, “young ladies,
to think as I've nothing to offer you. I eats my
dinner at the Globe, having nobody here to cook.
However I'd have had a morsel of cake or so, if the
young gentleman had been so kind as to give me an
item before-hand of your intending me the favour.
But as to getting things into the house hap hazard,
really every thing is so dear—it's quite out of rea∣son.”</P>
<P>The scampering of horses now carrying them to a
window, they saw some hounds in full cry, followed
by horse-men in full gallop. Lionel declared he
would borrow Jacob's mare, and join them, while
his sisters walked about the grounds: but Camilla,
taking him aside, made a serious expostulation, pro∣testing
<PB N="333" REF="142"/>
that her father, with all his indulgence, and
even her uncle himself, would be certainly displeased,
if he left them alone with this man; of whom they
knew nothing but his very low trade.</P>
<P>“Why what is his trade?”</P>
<P>“A tinker's: Mrs. Arlbery told me so.”</P>
<P>He laughed violently at this information, protest∣ing
he was rejoiced to find so much money could be
made by the tinkering business, which he was deter∣mined
to follow in his next distress for cash: yet
added, he feared this was only the malice of Mrs.
Arlbery, for Dubster, he had been told, had kept a
shop for ready made wigs.</P>
<P>He gave up, however, his project, forgetting the
chace when he no longer heard the hounds, and de∣sired
Mr. Dubster to proceed in shewing his lions.</P>
<P>“Lauk a day! Sir, I've got no lions, nor tygers
neither. It's a deal of expence keeping them ani∣mals;
and though I know they reckon me near, I
sha'n't do no such thing; for if a man does not take
a little care of his money when once he has got it,
especially if it's honestly, I thing he's a fool for his
pains; begging pardon for speaking my mind so
freely.”</P>
<P>He then led them again to the front of the house,
where he desired they would look at his pond.
“This,” said he, “is what I value the most of all,
except my summer house and my labyrinth. I shall
stock it well; and many a good dinner I hope to eat
from it. It gets me an appetite, sometimes, I think,
only to look at it.”</P>
<P>“'Tis a beautiful piece of water,” said Lionel,
“and may be useful to the outside as well as the in∣side,
for, if you go in head foremost, you may bathe
as well as feed from it.”</P>
<P>“No, I sha'n't do that, Sir, I'm not over and
above fond of water at best. However I shall have
a swan.”</P>
<P>“A swan? why sure you won't be contented with
only one?”</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="143"/>
“O yes, I shall. It will only be made of wood,
painted over in white. There's no end of feeding
them things if one has 'em alive. Besides it will
look just as pretty; and won't bite. And I know
a friend of mine that one of them creatures flew at,
and gave him such a bang as almost broke his leg,
only for throwing a stone at it, out of mere play.
They are mortal spiteful, if you happen to hurt
them when you're in their reach.”</P>
<P>He then begged them to go over to his island,
which proved to be what Eugenia had taken for a
mass of rubbish. They would fain have been ex∣cused
crossing a plank which he called a bridge, but
Lionel would not be denied</P>
<P>“Now here,” said he, “when my island's finished,
I shall have something these young ladies will like;
and that's a lamb.”</P>
<P>“Alive, or dead?” cried Lionel.</P>
<P>“Alive,” he replied, “for I shall have good pas∣ture
in a little bit of ground just by,” where I shall
keep me a cow; and here will be grass enough upon
my island to keep it from starving on Sundays, and
for now and then, when I've somebody come to see
me. And when it's fit for killing, I can change it
with the farmer down the lane, for another young
one, by a bargain I've agreed with him for already;
for I don't love to run no risks about a thing for mere
pleasure.</P>
<P>“Your place will be quite a paradise,” said
Lionel.</P>
<P>“Why, indeed, Sir, I think I've earned having
a little recreeting, for I worked hard enough for it,
before I happened of meeting with my first wife.”</P>
<P>“O, ho! so you began with marrying a for∣tune?”</P>
<P>“Yes, Sir, and very pretty she was too, if she
had not been so puny. But she was always ailing.
She cost me a mort of money to the potecary before
she went off. And she was a tedious while a dying,
poor soul!”</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="144"/>
“Your first wife? surely you have not been twice
married already?”</P>
<P>“Yes, I have. My second wife brought me a
very pretty fortune too. I can't say but I've rather
had the luck of it, as far as I've gone yet awhile.”</P>
<P>They now repassed the plank, and were conducted
to an angle, in which a bench was placed close to the
chinese rails, which was somewhat shaded by a wil∣low,
that grew in a little piece of stagnant water on
the other side. A syringa was planted in front, and
a broom-tree on the right united it with the willow;
in the middle there was a deal table.</P>
<P>“Now, young ladies,” said Mr. Dubster, “if
you have a taste to brea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he a little fresh country air,
here's where I advise you to take your rest. When
I come to this place first, my arbour, as I call this,
had no look out, but just to the fields, so I cut away
them lilacs, and now there's a good pretty look out.
And it's a thing not to be believed what a sight of
people and coaches, and gentlemen's whiskeys, and
stages, and flys, and waggons, and all sorts of things
as ever you can think of, goes by all day long. I
often think people's got but little to do at home.”</P>
<P>Next, he desired to lead them to his grotto, which
he said was but just begun. It was, indeed, as yet,
nothing but a little square hole, dug into a chalky
soil, down into which, no steps being yet made, he
slided as well as he could, to the no small whitening
of his old brown coat, which already was thread
bare.</P>
<P>He begged the ladies to follow, that he might shew
them the devices he had marked out with his own
hand, and from his own head, for fitting up the in∣side.
Lionel would not suffer his sisters to refuse
compliance, though Mr. Dubster himself cautioned
them to come carefully, “in particular,” he said,
“the little lady, as she has happened of an ugly ac∣cident
already, as I judge, in one of her hips, and
'twould be pity, at her time of life, if she should
happen of another at t'other side.”</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="145"/>
Eugenia, not aware this misfortune was so glaring,
felt much hurt by this speech; and Camilla, very
angry with its speaker, sought to silence him by a re∣sentful
look; but not observing it; “Pray, ma'am,”
he continued, “was it a fall? or was you born so?”</P>
<P>Eugenia looked struck and surprized; and Ca∣milla
hastily whispered it was a fall, and bid him say
no more about it; but, not understanding her, “I
take it, then,” he said, “that was what stinted your
growth so, Miss? for, I take it, you're not much
above the dwarf as they shew at Exeter Change?
Much of a muchness, I guess. Did you ever see
him, ma'am?”</P>
<P>“No, Sir.”</P>
<P>“It would be a good sight enough to see you to∣gether.
He'd think himself a man in a minute.
You must have had the small pox mortal bad, ma'am.
I suppose you'd the conflint sort?”</P>
<P>Camilla here, without waiting for help, slid down
into the intended grotto, and asked a thousand ques∣tions
to change the subject; while Eugenia, much
disconcerted, slowly followed, aided by Lionel.</P>
<P>Mr. Dubster then displayed the ingenious inter∣mixture
of circles and diamonds projected for the
embellishment of his grotto; the first of which were
to be formed with cockle-shells, which he meant to
colour with blue paint: and the second he proposed
shaping with bits of shining black coal. The spaces
between would each have an oyster-shell in the middle,
and here and there he designed to leave the chalk to
itself, which would always, he observed, make the
grotto light and cheary. Shells he said, unluckily,
he did not happen to have; but as he had thoughts
of taking a little pleasure some summer at Bright∣helmstone
or Margate, for he intended to see all those
places, he should make a collection then; being told
he might have as curious shells, and pebbles too, as a
man could wish to look at, only for the trouble of
picking them up off the shore.</P>
<P>They next went to what he called his labyrinth,
which was a little walk he was cutting, zig-zag, through
<PB N="337" REF="146"/>
some brush-wood, so low that no person above three
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oot height could be hid by it. Every step they took
here, cost a rent to some lace or some muslin of one
of the sisters; which Mr. Dubster observed with a
delight he could not conceal; saying this was a true
country walk, and would do them both a great deal of
good; and adding: “we that live in town, would
give our ears for such a thing as this.” And though
they could never proceed a yard at a time, from the
continual necessity of disentangling their dress from
thorns and briars, he exultingly boasted that he should
give them a good appetite for their dinner; and
asked if this rural ramble did not make them begin
to feel hungry. “For my part,” continued he,
“if once I get settled a bit, I shall take a turn in
this zig-zag every day before dinner, which may save
me my five grains of rhubarb, that the doctor or∣dered
me for my stomach, since my having my ill∣ness,
which come upon me almost as soon as I was a
gentleman; from change of life, I believe, for I
never knew no other reason; and none of the doc∣tors
could tell me nothing about it. But a man
that's had a deal to do, feels quite unked at first,
when he's only got to look and s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are about him, and
just walk from one room to another, without no em∣ployment.”</P>
<P>Lionel said he hoped, at least, he would not re∣quire
his rhubarb to get down his dinner to-day.</P>
<P>“I hope so too, 'squire,” answered he, licking
his lips, “for I've ordered a pretty good one, I can
tell you; beef steaks and onions; and I don't know
what's better. Tom Hicks is to dine with me at the
Globe, as soon as I've give my workmen their tasks,
and seen after a young lad that's to do me a job there,
by my grot to. Tom Hicks is a very good fellow;
I like him best of any acquaintance I've made in
these here parts. Indeed, I've made no other, on
account of the unconvenence of dressing, while I'm
so much about with my workmen. So I keep pretty
incog from the genteel; and Tom does well enough
in the interim.”</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="147"/>
He then requested them to make haste to his
summer-house, because his workmen would be soon
returned, and he could not then spare a moment
longer, without spoiling his own dinner.</P>
<P>“My summer house,” said he, “is not above half
complete yet; but it will be very pretty when it's
done. Only I've got no stai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s yet to it; but there's
a very good ladder, if the ladies a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n't afraid.”</P>
<P>The ladies both desired to be excused mounting;
but Lionel protested he would not have his friend
affronted; and as neither of them were in the habit
of resisting him, nor of investigating with seriousness
any thing that he proposed, they were soon teized
into acquiescence, and he assisted them to ascend.</P>
<P>Mr. Dubster followed.</P>
<P>The summer-house was, as yet, no more than a
shell; without windows, scarcely roofed, and com∣posed
of lath and plaister, not half dry. It looked
on to the high road, and Mr. Dubster assured them,
that, on market days, the people passed so thick,
there was no seeing them for the dust.</P>
<P>Here they had soon cause to repent their facility,
—that dangerous, yet venial, because natural fault
of youth; for hardly had they entered this place,
ere a distant glimpse of a fleet stag, and a party of
sportsmen, incited Lionel to scamper down; and
calling out: “I shall be back presently,” he made
off towards the house, dragging the ladder after
him.</P>
<P>The sisters eagerly and almost angrily remonstrat∣ed;
but to no purpose; and while they were still
entreating him to return, and supposing him, though
out of sight, within hearing, they suddenly per∣ceived
him passing the window by the high road, on
horse-back, switch in hand, and looking in the ut∣most
glee. “I have borrowed Jacob's mare,” he
cried, “for just half an hour's sport, and sent Jacob
and coachy to get a little refreshment at the next
public house; but don't be impatient; I shan't be
long.”</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="148"/>
Off then, he galloped, laughing; in defiance of
the serious entreaties of his sisters, and without stay∣ing
to hear even one sentence of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormal exhorta∣tions
of Mr. Dubster.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="38" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A few Compliments.</HEAD>
<P>THE two young ladies and Mr. Dubster left thus
together, and so situated that separation without as∣sistance
was impossible, looked at one another for
some time in nearly equal dismay; and then Mr.
Dubster, with much displeasure, exclaimed—“Them
young gentlemen are as full of mischief, as an egg's
full of meat! Who'd have thought of a person's
going to do such a thing as this?—it's mortal un∣convenent,
making me leave my workmen at this
rate▪ for I dare say they're come, or coming, by
this time. I wish I'd tied the ladder to this here
rafter.”</P>
<P>The sisters, though equally provoked, thought it
necessary to make some apology <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the wild beha∣viour
of their brother.</P>
<P>“O, young ladies,” said he, formally waving his
hand by way of a bow, “I don't in the least mean
to blame you about it, for you're very welcome to
stay as long as it's agreeable; only I hope he'll
come back by my dinner time; for a cold beef-steak
is one or other the worst morsel I know.”</P>
<P>He then kept an unremitting watch from one
window to another, for some passenger from whom
he could claim aid; but, much as he had boasted of
the numbers perpetually in sight, he now dolorously
confessed, that, sometimes, not a soul came near the
place for half a day together: “And, as to my
workmen,” continued he, “the deuce can't make
<PB N="340" REF="149"/>
'em hear if once they begin their knocking and ham∣mering.”</P>
<P>And then, with a smi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k at the idea, he added—
“I'll tell you what; I'd best give a good squall at
once, and then if they are come, I may catch 'em;
in the proviso you won't mind it, young ladies.”</P>
<P>This scheme was put immediately into practice;
but though the sisters were obliged to stop their ears
from his vociferation, it answered no purpose.</P>
<P>“Well, I'll bet you what you will,” cried he,
“they are all deaf: however, it's as well as it is, for
if they was to come, and see me hoisted up in this
cage, like, they'd only make a joke of it; and then
they'd mind me no more than a pin never again.
It's surprising how them young gentlemen never
think of nothing. If he'd served me so when I was
a 'prentice, he'd have paid pretty dear for his frolic;
master would have charged him half a day's work,
as sure as a gun.”</P>
<P>Soon after, while looking out of the window, “I
do think,” he exclaimed, “I see somebody!—It
shall go hard but what I'll make 'em come to us.”</P>
<P>He then shouted with great violence; but the per∣son
crossed a style into a field, without seeing or hear∣ing
him.</P>
<P>This provoked him very seriously; and turning to
Camilla, rather indignantly, he said—“Really,
ma'am, I wish you'd tell your brother, I should take
it as a favour he'd never serve me o' this manner no
more!”</P>
<P>She hoped, she said, he would in future be more
considerate.</P>
<P>“It's a great hindrance to business, ma'am, such
things: and it's a sheer love of mischief, too, begging
pardon, fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it's of no manner of use to him, no
more than it is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o us.”</P>
<P>He then desired, that if any body should pass by
again, they might all squall out at once; saying, it
was odds, then, but they might be heard.</P>
<P>“Not that it's over agreeable at the best,” added
he; “for if one was to stop any poor person, and
<PB N="341" REF="150"/>
make 'em come round, and look for the ladder, one
could not be off giving them something: and as to
any of the gentlefolks, one might beg and pray as
long as one would before they'd stir a step for one:
and as to any of one's acquaintance, if they was to
go by, it's ten to one but they'd only fall a laugh∣ing.
People's generally ill-natured when they sees
one in jeopardy.”</P>
<P>Eugenia, already thoughtful and discomposed,
now grew uneasy, lest her uncle should be surprised
at her long absence; this a little appeased Mr. Dub∣ster,
who, with less resentment, said—“So I see,
then, we're all in the same quandary! However,
don't mind it, young ladies; you can have no great
matters to do with your time, I take it; so it does
not so much signify. But a man's quite different.
He looks like a fool, as one may say, poked up in
such a place as this, to be stared at by all comers and
goers; only nobody happens to pass by.”</P>
<P>His lamentations now were happily interrupted by
the appearance of three women and a boy, who,
with baskets on their heads, were returning from the
next market town. With infinite satisfaction, he
prepared to assail them, saying, he should now have
some chance to get a bit of dinner: and assuring the
ladies, that if they-should like a little scrap for a re∣lish,
he should be very willing to send 'em it by their
footman; “For it's a long while,” said he, “young
ladies, to be fasting, that's the truth of it.”</P>
<P>The market women now approached, and were
most clamorously hailed, before their own loud dis∣course,
and the singing and whistling of the boy,
permitted their hearing the appeal.</P>
<P>“Pray, will you be so kind,” said Mr. Dubster,
when he had made them stop, “as to step round by
the house, and see if you can see the workmen; and
if you can, tell 'em a young gentleman, as come here
while they was at dinner, has taken away the ladder,
and left us stuck up here in the lurch.”</P>
<P>The women all laughed, and said it was a good
merry trick; but were preparing to follow his di∣rections,
<PB N="342" REF="151"/>
when Mr. Dubster called after the boy,
who loitered behind, with an encouraging nod: “If
you'll bring the ladder with you upon your shoulders,
my lad, I'll give you a half-penny!”</P>
<P>The boy was well contented; but the women, a
little alarmed, turned back and said—“And what
will you give to us, master?”</P>
<P>“Give?” repeated he, a little embarrassed;
“why, I'll give—why I'll thank you kindly; and
it won't be much out of your way, for the house is
only round there.”</P>
<P>“You'll thank us kindly, will you?” said one of
the women; “it's like you may! But what will you
do over and above?”</P>
<P>“Do? why it's no great matter, just to stop at
the house as you go by, and tell 'em—”</P>
<P>Here Eugenia whispered she would herself satisfy
them, and begged he would let them make their own
terms.</P>
<P>“No, Miss, no; I don't like to see nobody's
money fooled away, no more than my own. How∣ever,
as you are so generous, I'll agree with 'em to
give 'em a pot of beer.”</P>
<P>He then, with some parade, made this concession;
but said, he must see the ladder, before the money
should be laid down.</P>
<P>“A pot of beer for four!—a pot of beer for
four!” they all exclaimed in a breath; and down
every one put her basket, and set her arms a kembo,
unanimously declaring, they would shame him for such
stinginess.</P>
<P>The most violent abuse now followed, the boy
imitating them, and every other sentence concluding
with—“A pot of beer for four!—ha!”</P>
<P>Camilla and Eugenia, both frightened, besought
that they might have any thing, and every thing,
that could appease them: but Mr. Dubster was in∣flexible
not to submit to imposition, because of a
few foul words; “For, dear heart,” said he,
“what harm will they do us!—they an't of no con∣sequence.”</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="152"/>
Then, addressing them again, “As to four,” he
cried, “that's one over the bargain, for I did not
reckon the boy for nothing.”</P>
<P>“You didn't, didn't you?” cried the boy;
“i'cod, I hope I'm as good as you, any day in the
year!”</P>
<P>“You'll thank us kindly, will you?” said one of
the women; “I'fackens, and so you shall, when
we're fools enough to sarve you!—A pot of beer
for four!”</P>
<P>“We help you down!—we get you a ladder!”
cried another; “yes, forsooth, it's like we may!
—no, stay where you are, like a toad in a hole as
you be!”</P>
<P>Camilla and Eugenia now, tired of vain applica∣tion
to Mr. Dubster, who heard all this abuse with
the most sedate unconcern, advanced themselves to
the window; and Eugenia, ever foremost where
money was to be given, began—“Good women—”
when, with a violent loud shout, they called out—
“What! are you all in Hob's pound? Well, they
as will may let you out for we; so I wish you a merry
time of it!”</P>
<P>Eugenia began again her—“Good women—”
when the boy exclaimed—“What were you put up
there for, Miss? to frighten the crows?”</P>
<P>Eugenia, not understanding him, was once more
re-commencing; but the first woman said—“I sup∣pose
you think we'll sarve you for looking at?—no
need to be paid?”</P>
<P>“Yes, yes,” cried the second, “Miss may go to
market with her beauty; she'll not want for nothing
if she'll shew her pretty face!”</P>
<P>“She need not be afeard of it, however,” said
the third, “for 'twill never be no worse. Only take
care, Miss, you don't catch the small pox!”</P>
<P>“O fegs, that would be pity!” cried the boy,
“for fear Miss should be marked.”</P>
<P>Eugenia, astonished and confounded, made no
farther attempt; but Camilla, though at that mo∣ment
she could have inslicted any punishment upon
<PB N="344" REF="153"/>
such unprovoked assailants, affected to give but little
weight to what they said, and gently drew her away.</P>
<P>“Hoity, toity!” cried one of the women, as she
moved off, “why, Miss, do you walk upon your
knees?”</P>
<P>“Why my Poll would make two of her,” said
another, “though she's only nine years old.”</P>
<P>“She won't take much for cloaths,” cried an∣other,
“that's one good thing.”</P>
<P>“I'd answer to make her a gown out of my apron,”
said the third.</P>
<P>“Your apron?” cried another, “your pocket
handkerchief you mean!—why she'd be lost in your
apron, and you might look half an hour before you'd
find her.”</P>
<P>Eugenia, to whom such language was utterly new,
was now in such visible consternation, that Camilla,
affrighted, earnestly charged Mr. Dubster to find
any means, either of menace or of reward, to make
them depart.</P>
<P>“Lauk, don't mind them, ma'am,” cried he, fol∣lowing
Eugenia, “they can't do you no hurt;
though they are rather rude, I must needs confess the
truth, to say such things to your face. But one
must not expect people to be over polite, so far from
London. However, I see the sporting gentry com∣ing
round, over that way, yonder; and I warrant
they'll gallop 'em off. Hark'ce, Mistresses! them
gentlemen that are coming here, shall take you be∣fore
the justice, for affronting Sir Hugh's Tyrold's
Heiresses to all his fortunes.”</P>
<P>The women, to whom the name and generous
deeds of Sir Hugh Tyrold were familiar, were now
quieted and dismayed. They offered some aukward
apologies, of not guessing such young ladies could
be posted up in such a place; and hoped it would be
no detriment to them at the ensuing Christmas, when
the good Baronet gave away beef and beer; but
Mr. Dubster pompously ordered them to make off,
saying, he would not accept the ladder from them
now, for the gentry that were coming would get it
<PB N="345" REF="154"/>
for nothing: “So troop off,” cried he; “and as
for you,” to the boy, “you shall have your jacket
well trimmed, I promise you: I know who you are,
well enough: and I'll tell your master of you, as
sure a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you're alive.”</P>
<P>Away then, with complete, though not well∣principled
repentance, they all marched.</P>
<P>Mr. Dubster, turning round with exultation,
cried—“I only said that to frighten them, for I
never see 'em before, as I know of. But I don't
mind 'em of a rush; and I hope you don't neither.
Though I can't pretend it's over agreeable being
made fun of. If I see any body snigger at me, I
always ask 'em what it's for; for I'd as lieve they'd
let it alone.”</P>
<P>Eugenia, who, as there was no seat, had sunk
upon the floor for rest and for refuge, remained silent,
and seemed almost petrified; while Camilla, affec∣tionately
leaning over her, began talking upon other
subjects, in hopes to dissipate a shock she was ashamed
to console.</P>
<P>She made no reply, no comment; but, sighed
deeply.</P>
<P>“Lauk!” cried Mr. Dubster, “what's the
matter with the young lady! I hope she don't go
for to take to heart what them old women says?
she'll be never the worse to look at, because of their
impudence. Besides, fretting does no good to
nothing. If you'll only come and stand here, where
I do, Miss, you may have a peep at ever so many
dogs, and all the gentlemen, riding helter skelter
round that hill. It's a pretty sight enough for them
as has nothing better to mind. I don't know but I
might make one among them myself, now and then,
if it was not for the expensiveness of hiring of a
horse.”</P>
<P>Here some of the party came galloping towards
them; and Mr. Dubster made so loud an out-cry,
that two or three of the sportsmen looked up, and
one of them, riding close to the summer house, per∣ceived
the two young ladies, and, instantly dismount∣ing,
<PB N="346" REF="155"/>
fastened his horse to a tree, and contrived to
scramble up into the little unfinished building.</P>
<P>Camilla then saw it was Major Cerwood. She ex∣plained
to him the mischievous frolic of her brother,
and accepted his offered services to find the ladder
and the carriage.</P>
<P>Eugenia meanwhile rose and courtsied in answer
to his enquiries after her health, and then, gravely
fixing her eyes upon the ground, took no further
notice of him.</P>
<P>The object of the Major was not Eugenia; her
taciturnity therefore did not affect him; but pleased
to be shut up with Camilla, he soon found out that
though to mount had been easy, to descend would be
difficult; and, after various mock efforts, pronounc∣ed
it would be necessary to wait till some assistance
arrived from below: adding, young Mr. Tyrold
would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oon return, as he had seen him in the hunt.</P>
<P>Camilla, whose concern now was all for her sister,
heard this with indifference; but Mr. Dubster lost
all patience. “So here,” said he, “I may stay,
and let Tom Hicks eat up all my dinner! for I can't
expect him to fast, because of this young gentle∣man's
comical tricks. I've half a mind to give a
jump down myself, and go look for the ladder; only
I'm not over light. Besides, if one should break
one's leg, it's but a hard thing upon a man to be a
cripple in the middle of life. It's no such great
hindrance to a lady, so I don't say it out of disre∣spect;
because ladies can't do much at the best.”</P>
<P>The Major, finding Dubster was his host, thought
it necessary to take some notice of him, and asked
him if he never rode out.</P>
<P>“Why no, not much of that, Sir,” he answered;
“for when a man's not over used to riding, one's
apt to get a bad tumble sometimes. I believe it's as
well let alone. I never see as there was much wit in
breaking one's neck before one's time. Besides,
half them gentlemen are no better than sharpers,
begging pardon, for all they look as if they could
knock-one down.”</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="156"/>
“How do you mean sharpers, Sir?”</P>
<P>“Why they don't pay every one his own, not one
in ten of them. And they're as proud as Lucifer.
If I was to go among them to-morrow, I'll lay a
wager they'd take no notice of me: unless I was to
ask them to dinner. And a man may soon eat up
his substance, if he's so over complaisant.”</P>
<P>“Surely, Major,” cried Camilla, “my brother
cannot be much longer before he joins us?—remem∣bers
us rather.”</P>
<P>“Who else could desert or forget you?” cried the
Major.</P>
<P>“It's a moot point whether he'll come or no, I
see that,” said Mr. Dubster, quite enraged; “them
young 'squires never know what to do for their fun.
I must needs say I think it's pity but what he'd been
brought up to some calling. 'Twould have steadied
him a little, I warrant. He don't seem to know
much of the troubles of life.”</P>
<P>A shower of rain now revived his hopes that the
fear of being wet might bring him back; not con∣sidering
how little sportsmen regard wet jackets.</P>
<P>“However,” continued he, “it's really a piece
of good luck that he was not taken with a fancy to
leave us upon my island; and then we might all have
been soused by this here rain: and he could just as
well have walked off with my bridge as with the
ladder.”</P>
<P>Here, to his inexpressible relief, Lionel, from the
road, hailed them; and Camilla, with emotion the
most violent, perceived Edgar was by his side.</P>
<P>Mr. Dubster, however, angry as well as glad, very
solemnly said, “I wonder, Sir, what you think my
workmen has been doing all this time, with nobody
to look after them? Besides that I promised a pot
o'beer to a lad to wheel me away all that rubbish that
I'd cut out of my grotto; and it's a good half day's
work, do it who will; and ten to one if they've
stirred a nail, all left to themselves so.”</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="157"/>
“Pho, pho, man, you've been too happy, I hope,
to trouble your mind about business. How do do,
my little girls? how have you been entertained?”</P>
<P>“This is a better joke to you than to us, 'squire;
but pray, Sir, begging pardon, how come you to
forget what I told you about the Globe? I know
very well that they say it's quite alley-mode to make,
fun, but can't pretend as I'm over fond of the cus∣tom.”</P>
<P>He then desired that, at least, if he would not get
the ladder himself, he would tell that other gentle∣man,
that was with him, what he had done with it.</P>
<P>Edgar, having met Lionel, and heard from him
how and where he had left his sisters, had impatiently
ridden with him to their relief; but when he saw that
the Major made one in the little party, and that he
was standing by Camilla, he felt hurt and amazed,
and proceeded no farther.</P>
<P>Camilla believed herself careless of his opinion;
what she had heard from Miss Margland of his pro∣fessed
indifference, gave her now as much resentment;
as at first it had caused her grief. She thought such
a declaration an unprovoked indignity; she deigned
not even to look at him, resolved for ever to avoid
him; yet to prove herself, at the same time, unmor∣tified
and disengaged, talked cheerfully with the
Major.</P>
<P>Lionel now, producing the ladder, ran up it to
help his sisters to descend; and Edgar, dismounting,
could not resist entering the grounds, to offer them
his hand as they came down.</P>
<P>Eugenia was first assisted; for Camilla talked on
with the Major, as if not hearing she was called:
and Mr. Dubster, his complaisance wholly worn out,
next followed, bowing low to every one separately,
and begging pardon, but saying he could really afford
to waste no more time, without going to give a little
look after his workmen, to see if they were alive or
dead.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="158"/>
At this time the horse of the Major, by some ac∣cident,
breaking loose, his master was forced to run
down, and Lionel scampered after to assist him.</P>
<P>Camilla remained alone; Edgar, slowly mounting
the ladder, gravely offered his services; but, hastily
leaning out of the window, she pretended to be too
much occupied in watching the motions of the Major
and his horse, to hear or attend to any thing else.</P>
<P>A sigh now tore the heart of Edgar, from doubt
if this were preference to the Major, or the first dawn
of incipient coquetry; but he called not upon her
again; he stood quietly behind, till the horse was
seized, and the Major re-ascended the ladder. They
then stood at each side of it, with offers of assist∣ance.</P>
<P>This appeared to Camilla a fortunate moment for
making a spirited display of her indifference: she
gave her hand to the Major, and, slightly courtesying
to Edgar as she passed, was conducted to the car∣riage
of her uncle.</P>
<P>Lionel again was the only one who spoke in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he
short route to Etherington, whence Eugenia, with∣out
alighting, returned to Cleves.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="39" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Danger of Disguise.</HEAD>
<P>EDGAR remained behind, almost petrified: he
stood in the little building looking after them, yet
neither descending nor stirring, till one of the work∣men
advanced to fetch the ladder. He then hastily
quitted the spot, mounted his horse, and galloped
after the carriage; though without any actual design
to follow it, or any formed purpose whither to go.</P>
<P>The sight, however, of the Major, pursuing the
same route, made him, with deep disgust, turn about,
and take the shortest road to Beech Park.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="159"/>
He hardly breathed the whole way from indigna∣tion;
yet his wrath was without definition, and
nearly beyond comprehen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ibility even to himself, till
suddenly recurring to the lovely smile with which
Camilla had accepted the assistance of Major Cer∣wood,
he involuntarily chasped his hands, and called
out: “O happy Major!”</P>
<P>Awakened by this ejaculation to the true state of
his feelings, he started as from a sword held at his
breast. “Jealousy!” he cried, “am I red<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ced to
so humiliating a passion? Am I capable of love with∣out
trust? Unhappy enough to cherish it with hope?
No! I will not be such a slave to the delusions of in∣clination.
I will abandon neither my honour nor my
judgment to my wishes. It is not alone even her
heart that can fully satisfy me; its delicacy must be
mine as well as its preference. Jealousy is a passion
for which my mind is not framed, and which I must
not find a torment, but an impossibility!”</P>
<P>He now began to fear he had made a choice the
most injudicious, and that coquet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y and caprice had
only waited opportunity, to take place of candour
and frankness.</P>
<P>Yet, recollecting the disclaiming speeches he had
been compelled to make at Cleves, he thought, if
she had heard them, she might be actuated by resent∣ment.
Even then, however, her manner of shew∣ing
it was alarming, and fraught with mischief. He
reflected with fresh repugnance upon the gay and dis∣sipated
society with which she was newly mixing,
and which, from her extreme openness and facility,
might so easily, yet so fatally, fully the fair artless∣ness
of her mind.</P>
<P>He then felt tempted to hint to Mr. Tyrold, who,
viewing all things, and all people in the best light,
rarely foresaw danger, and never suspected deception,
the expediency of her breaking off this intercourse,
till she could pursue it under the security of her mo∣ther's
penetrating protection. But it occurred to
him, next, it was possible the Major might have
pleased her. Ardent as were his own views, they
<PB N="351" REF="160"/>
had never been declared, while those of the Major
seemed proclaimed without reserve. He felt his face
tingle at the idea, though it nearly made his heart
cease to beat; and determined to satisfy this con∣jecture
ere he took any measure for himself.</P>
<P>To speak to her openly, he thought the surest as
well as fairest way, and resolved, with whatever an∣guish,
should he find the Major favoured, to aid her
choice in his fraternal character, and then travel till
he should forget her in every other.</P>
<P>For this purpose, it was necessary to make imme∣diate
enquiry into the situation of the Major, and
then, if she would hear him, relate to her the result;
well assured to gather the state of her heart upon this
subject, by her manner of attending to the least word
by which it should be introduced.</P>
<P>Camilla, meanwhile, was somewhat comforted by
the exertion she had shewn, and by her hopes it had
struck Edgar with respect.</P>
<P>The next morning, Sir Hugh sent for her again,
and begged she would pass the whole day with her
sister Eugenia, and use all her pretty ways to amuse
her: for she had returned home, the preceding morn∣ing,
quite moped with melancholy, and had con∣tinued
pining ever since; refusing to leave her room,
even for meals, yet giving no reason for her behaviour.
What had come to her he could not tell; but to see
her so, went to his heart; for she had always, he
said, till now, been chearful and even tempered,
though thinking over her learning made her not much
of a young person.</P>
<P>Camilla flew up stairs, and found her, with a look
of despondence, seated in a corner of her room,
which she had darkened by nearly shutting all the
shutters.</P>
<P>She knew but too well the rude shock she had re∣ceived,
and sought to revive her with every expression
of soothing kindness. But she shook her head, and
<PB N="352" REF="161"/>
continued mute, melancholy, and wrapt in medita∣tion.</P>
<P>More than an hour was spent thus, the strict or∣ders
of Sir Hugh forbidding them any intrusion:
but when, at length, Camilla ventured to say, “Is
it possible, my dearest Eugenia, the passing insolence
of two or three brutal wretches can affect you thus
deeply?” She awakened from her silent trance, and
raising her head, while something bordering upon
resentment began to kindle in her breast, cried,
“Spare me this question, Camilla, and I will spare
you all reproach.”</P>
<P>“What reproach, my dear sister,” cried Camilla,
amazed, “what reproach have I merited?”</P>
<P>“The reproach,” answered she, solemnly; “that,
from me, all my family merit! the reproach of re∣presenting
to me, that thousands resembled me! of
assuring me I had nothing peculiar to myself, though
I was so unlike all my family—of deluding me into
utter ignorance of my unhappy defects, and then
casting me, all unconscious and unprepared, into the
wide world to hear them!”</P>
<P>She would now have shut herself into her book∣closet;
but Camilla, forcing her way, and almost
kneeling to be heard, conjured her to drive such cruel
ideas from her mind, and to treat the barbarous in∣sults
that she had suffered with the contempt they
deserved.</P>
<P>“Camilla,” said she, firmly; “I am no longer
to be deceived nor trifled with. I will no more ex∣pose
to the light a form and face so hideous:—I will
retire from all mankind, and end my destined course
in a solitude that no one shall discover.”</P>
<P>Camilla, terrified, besought her to form no such
plan, bewailed the unfortunate adventure of the pre∣ceding
day, inveighed against the inhuman women,
and pleaded the love of all her family with the most
energetic affection.</P>
<P>“Those women,” said she, calmly, “are not to
blame; they have been untutored, but not false; and
they have only uttered such truths as I ought to have
<PB N="353" REF="162"/>
learnt from my cradle. My own blindness has been
infatuated; but it sprung from inattention and ig∣norance.
—It is now removed!—Leave me, Camilla;
give notice to my Uncle he must find me some re∣treat.
Tell all that has passed to my father. I will
myself write to my mother—and when my mind is
more subdued, and when sincerely and unaffectedly I
can forgive you all from my heart, I may consent to
see you again.”</P>
<P>She then positively insisted upon being left.</P>
<P>Camilla, penetrated with her undeserved, yet irre∣mediable
distress, still continued at her door, sup∣plicating
for re-admittance in the softest terms; but
without any success till the second dinner bell sum∣moned
her down stairs. She then fervently called
upon her sister to speak once more, and tell her what
she must do, and what say?</P>
<P>Eugenia, steadily answered: “You have already
my commission: I have no change to make in it.”</P>
<P>Unable to obtain any thing further, she painfully
descended: but the voice of her Uncle no sooner
reached her ears from the dining parlour, than, shock∣ed
to convey to him so terrible a message, she again
ran up stairs, and casting herself against her sister's
door, called out “Eugenia, I dare not obey you!
would you kill my poor Uncle? My Uncle, who
loves us all so tenderly? Would you afflict—would
you make him unhappy?”</P>
<P>“No, not for the universe!” she answered, open∣ing
the door; and then, more gently, yet not less
stedfastly, looking at her, “I know,” she continued,
“you are all very good; I know all was meant for
the best; I know I must be a monster not to love
you for the very error to which I am a victim.—I
forgive you therefore all! and I blush to have felt
angry.—But yet—at the age of fifteen—at the in∣stant
of entering into the world—at the approach of
forming a connection which—O Camilla! what a time,
what a period, to discover—to know—that I cannot
even be seen without being derided and offended!”</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="163"/>
Her voice here faultered, and, running to the
window curtain, she entwined herself in its folds, and
called out: “O hide me! hide me! from every hu∣man
eye, from every thing that lives and breathes!
Pursue me, persecute me no longer, but suffer me to
abide by myself, till my fortitude is better strength∣ened
to meet my destiny!”</P>
<P>The least impatience from Eugenia was too rare to
be opposed; and Camilla, who, in common with all
her family, notwithstanding her extreme youth, re∣spected
as much as she loved her, sought only to ap∣pease
her by promising compliance. She gave to her,
therefore, an unresisted, though unreturned embrace,
and went to the dining parlour.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh was much disappointed to see her with∣out
her sister; but she evaded any account of her
commission till the meal was over, and then begged
to speak with him alone.</P>
<P>Gently and gradually she disclosed the source of the
sadness of Eugenia; but Sir Hugh heard it with a
dismay that almost overwhelmed him. All his con∣trition
for the evils of which, unhappily, he had
been the cause, returned with the severest force, and
far from opposing her scheme of retreat, he em∣powered
Camilla to offer her any residence she chose;
and to tell her he would keep out of her sight, as
the cause of all her misfortunes; or give her the imme∣diate
possession and disposal of his whole estate, if
that would make her better amends than to wait till
his death.</P>
<P>This message was no sooner delivered to Eugenia,
than losing at once every angry impression, she has∣tened
down stairs, and casting herself at the knees of
her Uncle, begged him to pardon her design, and
promised never to leave him while she lived.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, most affectionately embracing her, said
—“You are too good, my dear, a great deal too
good, to one who has used you so ill, at the very
time when you were too young to help yourself. I
have not a word to offer in my own behalf; except to
<PB N="355" REF="164"/>
hope you will forgive me, for the sake of its being
all done out of pure ignorance.”</P>
<P>“Alas, my dearest Uncle! all I owe to your in∣tentions,
is the deepest gratitude: and it is your's
from the bottom of my heart. Chance alone was
my enemy; and all I have to regret is, that no one
was sincere enough, kind enough, considerate enough,
to instruct me of the extent of my misfortunes, and
prepare me for the attacks to which I am liable.”</P>
<P>“My dear girl,” said he, while tears started into
his eyes, “what you say nobody can reply to; and
I find I have been doing you one wrong after another,
instead of the least good; for all this was by my own
order; which it is but fair to your brothers and
sisters, and father and mother, and the servants, to
confess. God knows, I have faults enough of my
own upon my head, without taking another of pre∣tending
to have none!”</P>
<P>Eugenia now sought to condole him in her turn,
voluntarily promising to mix with the family as usual,
and only desiring to be excused from going abroad, or
seeing any strangers.</P>
<P>“My dear,” said he, “you shall judge just what
you think fit, which is the least thing I can do for
you, after your being so kind as to forgive me; which
I hope to do nothing in future not to deserve more;
meaning always to ask my brother's advice: which
might have saved me all my worst actions, if I had
done it sooner; for I've used poor Camilla no better;
except not giving her the small pox, and that bad
fall. But don't hate me, my dears, if you can help
it, for it was none of it done for want of love; only
not knowing how to shew it in the proper manner;
which I hope you'll excuse for the score o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my bad
education.”</P>
<P>“O, my Uncle!” cried Camilla, throwing her
arms round his neck, while Eugenia embraced his
knees, “what language is this for nieces who owe so
much to your goodness, and who, next to their pa∣rents,
love you more than any thing upon earth!”</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="165"/>
“You are both the best little girls in the world,
my dears, and I need have nothing upon my con∣science
if you two pass it over; which is a great re∣lief
to me; for there's nobody else I've used so bad
as you two young girls; which, God knows, goes
to my heart whenever I think of it.—Poor little in∣nocents!—what
had you ever done to provoke me?”</P>
<P>The two sisters, with the most virtuous emulation,
vied with each other in demonstrative affection, till
he was tolerably consoled.</P>
<P>The rest of the day was ruffled but for one mo∣ment;
upon Sir Hugh's answering, to a proposition
of Miss Margland for a party to the next Middleton
races,—that there was no refusing to let Eugenia
take that pleasure, after her behaving so nobly: her
face was then again overcast with the deepest gloom;
and she begged not to hear of the races, nor of any
other place, public or private, for going abroad, as
she meant during the rest of her life, immoveably to
remain at home.</P>
<P>He looked much concerned, but assured her she
should be mistress in every thing.</P>
<P>Camilla left them in the evening, with a promise
to return the next day; and with every anxiety of
her own, lost in pity for her innocent and unfortu∣nate
sister.</P>
<P>She was soon, however, called back to herself,
when, with what light yet remained, she saw Edgar
ride up to the coach door.</P>
<P>With indefatigable pains he had devoted the day
to the search of information concerning the Major.
Of Mrs. Arlbery he had learned, that he was a man
of fashion, but small fortune; and from the Ensign
he had gathered, that even that small fortune was
gone, and that the estate in which it was vested, had
been mortgaged for three thousand pounds, to pay
certain debts of honour.</P>
<P>Edgar had already been to the Parsonage House,
but hearing Camilla was at Cleves, had made a short
visit, and determined to walk his horse upon the road
<PB N="357" REF="166"/>
till he met the carriage of Sir Hugh; believing he
could have no better opportunity of seeing her alone.</P>
<P>Yet when the coach, upon his riding up to the
door, stopt, he found himself in an embarrassment
for which he was unprepared. He asked how she did;
desired news of the health of all the family one by
one; and then, struck by the coldness of her an∣swers,
suffered the carriage to drive on.</P>
<P>Confounded at so sudden a loss of all presence of
mind, he continued, for a minute or two, just where
she left him; and then galloped after the coach, and
again presented himself at its window.</P>
<P>In a voice and manner the most hurried, he apo∣logised
for this second detention▪ “But, I believe,”
he said, “some genius of officiousness has to-day
taken possession of me, for I began it upon a Quix∣ote
sort of enterprise, and a spirit of knight errantry
seems willing to accompany me through it to the
end.”</P>
<P>He stopt; but she did not speak. Her first sen∣sation
at his sight had been wholly indignant; but
when she found he had something to say which he
knew not how to pronounce, her curiosity was
awakened, and she looked earnest for an explanation.</P>
<P>“I know,” he resumed, with considerable hesita∣tion,
“that to give advice and to give pain is com∣monly
the same thing;—I do not, therefore, mean—
I have no intention—though so lately you allowed
me a privilege never to be forgotten”—</P>
<P>He could not get on; and his embarrassment, and
this recollection, soon robbed Camilla of every angry
emotion▪ She looked down, but her countenance
was full of sensibility, and Edgar, recovering his
voice, proceeded—</P>
<P>“My Quixotism, I was going to say, of this
morning, though for a person of whom I know al∣most
nothing, would urge me to every possible ef∣fort—were
I certain the result would give pleasure to
the person for whom alo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>—since with regard to
himself,—I—it is merely—”</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="167"/>
Involved in expressions he knew not how to clear or
to finish, he was again without breath; and Camilla,
raising her eyes, looked at him with astonishment.</P>
<P>Endeavouring then to laugh, “One would think,”
cried he, “this same Quixotism had taken possession
of my intellects, and rendered them as confused as if,
instead of an agent, I were a principal.”—</P>
<P>Still wholly in the dark as to his aim, yet, satis∣fied
by these last words, it had no reference to him∣self,
she now lost enough of the acuteness of her cu∣riosity
to dare avow what yet remained; and begged
him, without further preface, to be more explicit.</P>
<P>Stammering, he then said, that the evident admi∣ration
with which a certain gentleman was seen to
sigh in her train, had awakened for him an interest,
which had induced some inquiries into the state of
his prospects and expectations. “These,” he con∣tinued,
“turn out to be, though not high, nor by
any means adequate to—to—however they are
such as some previous friendly exertions, with settled
future oeconomy, might render more propitious:
and for those previous exertions—Mr. Tyrold has a
claim which it would be the pride and happiness of
my life to see him honour;—if—if—”</P>
<P>The if almost dropt inarticulated; but he added—
“I shall make some further enquiries before I ven∣ture
to say any more.”</P>
<P>“For yourself, then, be they made, Sir!” cried
she, suddenly seizing the whole of the meaning—
“not for me?—whoever this person may be to whom
you allude—to me he is utterly indifferent.”</P>
<P>A flash of involuntary delight beamed in the eyes
of Edgar at these words; he had almost thanked
her, he had almost dropt the reins of his horse to
clasp his hands: but filled only with her own emo∣tions,
without watching his, or waiting for any an∣swer,
she coldly bid him good night, and called to
the coachman to drive fast home.</P>
<P>Edgar, however, was left with a sun-beam of the
most lively delight. “He is wholly indifferent to
her,” he cried, “she is angry at my interference;
<PB N="359" REF="168"/>
she has but acted a part in the apparent preference—
and for <HI>me,</HI> perhaps, acted it!”</P>
<P>Momentary, however, was the pleasure such a
thought could afford him;—“O, Camilla,” he
cried, “if, indeed, I might hope from you any par∣tiality,
why act any part at all!—how plain, how
easy, how direct your road to my heart, if but
straightly pursued!”</P>

<DIV1 N="40" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XL.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Strictures on Deformity.</HEAD>
<P>CAMILLA went on to Etherington in deep dis∣tress;
every ray of hope was chaced from her pros∣pects,
with a certainty more cruel, though less of∣fensive
to her feelings, than the crush given them by
Miss Margland. He cares not for me! she cried;
he even destines me for another! He is the willing
agent of the Major; he would portion me, I sup∣pose,
for him, to accelerate the impossibility of ever
thinking of me! And I imagined he loved me!—
what a dream!—what a dream!—how has he deceived
me!—or, alas! how have I deceived myself!</P>
<P>She rejoiced, however, that she had made so de∣cided
an answer with regard to Major Cerwood,
whom she could not doubt to be the person meant,
and who, presented in such a point of view, grew
utterly odious to her.</P>
<P>The tale she had to relate to Mr. Tyrold, of the
sufferings and sad resolution of Eugenia, obviated
all comment upon her own disturbance. He was
wounded to the heart by the recital. “Alas!” he
cried, “your wise and excellent mother always fore∣saw
some mischief would ensue, from the extreme
caution used to keep this dear unfortunate child ig∣norant
of her peculiar situation. This dreadful shake
<PB N="360" REF="169"/>
might have been palliated, at least, if not spared, by
the lessons of fortitude that noble woman would have
inculcated in her young and ductile mind. But I
could not resist the painful entreaties of my poor
brother, who, thinking himself the author of her
calamities, believed he was responsible for saving her
from feeling them; and, imagining all the world as
soft hearted as himself, concluded, that what her
own family would not tell her, she could never hear
elsewhere. But who should leave any events to the
caprices of chance, which the precautions of fore∣sight
can determine?”</P>
<P>These reflections, and the thoughts of her sister,
led at once and aided Camilla to stifle her own un∣happiness;
and for three days following, she devoted
herself wholly to Eugenia.</P>
<P>On the morning of the fourth, instead of sending
the carriage, Sir Hugh arrived himself to fetch Ca∣milla,
and to tell his brother, he must come also, to
give comfort to Eugenia; for, though he had thought
the worst was over, because she appeared quiet in his
presence, he had just surprised her in tears, by com∣ing
upon her unawares. He had done all he could,
he said, in vain; and nothing remained but for Mr.
Tyrold to try his hand himself: “For it is but jus∣tice,”
he added, “to Dr. Orkborne, to say she is
wiser than all our poor heads put together; so that
there is no answering her for want of sense.” He
then told him to be sure to put one of his best ser∣mons
in his pocket to read to her.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold was extremely touched for his poor
Eugenia, yet said he had half an hour's business to
transact in the neighbourhood, before he could go to
Cleves. Sir Hugh wai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed his time, and all three
then proceeded together.</P>
<P>Eugenia received her Father with a deliberate cold∣ness
that shocked him. He saw how profound was
the impression made upon her mind, not merely of
her personal evils, but of what she conceived to be
the misconduct of her friends.</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="170"/>
After a little general discourse, in which she bore
no share, he proposed walking in the park; meaning
there to take her aside, with less formality than he
could otherwise desire to speak with her alone.</P>
<P>The ladies and Sir Hugh immediately looked for
their hats or gloves: but Eugenia, saying she had a
slight head-ache, walked away to her room.</P>
<P>“This, my dear brother,” cried Sir Hugh, sor∣rowfully
following her with his eyes, “is the very
thing I wanted you for; she says she'll never more
stir out of these doors as long as she's alive; which
is a sad thing to say, considering her young years;
and nobody knowing how Clermont may approve it.
However, it's well I've had him brought up from the
beginning to the classics, which I rejoice at every day
more and more, it being the only wise thing I ever
did of my own head; for as to talking Latin and Greek,
which I suppose is what they will chiefly be doing,
there's no doubt but they may do it just as well in a
room as in the fields, or the streets.”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, after a little consideration, followed
her. He tapped at her door; she asked, in a tone
of displeasure, who was there?—“Your Father, my
dear,” he answered; and then, hastily opening it,
she proposed returning with him down stairs.</P>
<P>“No,” he said; “I wish to converse with you
alone. The opinion I have long cherished of your
heart and your understanding, I come now to put to
the proof.”</P>
<P>Eugenia, certain of the subject to which he would
lead, and feeling she could not have more to hear
than to say, gave him a chair, and composedly seated
herself next to him.</P>
<P>“My dear Eugenia,” said he, taking her passive
hand, “this is the moment that more grievously
than ever I lament the absence of your invaluable
Mother. All I have to offer to your consideration
she could much better have laid before you; and her
dictates would have met with the attention they so
completely deserve.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="171"/>
“Was my Mother, then, Sir,” said she, re∣proachfully,
“unapprized of the worldly darkness
in which I have been brought up? Is she unac∣quainted
that a little knowledge of books and lan∣guages
is what alone I have been taught?”</P>
<P>“We are all but too apt,” answered Mr. Tyrold,
mildly, though surprised, “to deem nothing worth
attaining but what we have missed, nothing worth
possessing but what we are denied. How many are
there, amongst the untaught and unaccomplished,
who would think an escape such as yours, of all in∣tellectual
darkness, a compensation for every other
evil!”</P>
<P>“They could think so only, Sir, while, like me,
they lived immured always in the same house, were
seen always by the same people, and were total
strangers to the sensations they might excite in any
others.”</P>
<P>“My dear Eugenia, grieved as I am at the pre∣sent
subject of your ruminations, I rejoice to see in
you a power of reflection, and of combination, so
far above your years. And it is a foothing idea to me
to dwell upon the ultimate benevolence of Providence,
even in circumstances the most afflicting: for if
chance has been unkind to you, Nature seems, with
fostering foresight, to have endowed you with pre∣cisely
those powers that may best s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t aside her ma∣lignity.”</P>
<P>“I see, Sir,” cried she, a little moved, “the
kindness of your intention; but pardon me if I an∣ticipate
to you its ill success. I have thought too
much upon my situation and my destiny to admit any
fallacious comfort. Can you, indeed, when once
her eyes are opened, can you expect to reconcile to
existence a poor young creature who sees herself an
object of derision and disgust? Who, without com∣mitting
any crime, without offending any human
being, finds she cannot appear but to be pointed at,
scoffed and insulted!”</P>
<P>“O my child! with what a picture do you wound
my heart, and tear your own peace and happiness!
<PB N="363" REF="172"/>
Wretches who in such a light can view outward de∣ficiencies
cannot merit a thought, are below even
contempt, and ought not be disdained, but forgotten.
Make a conquest, then, my Eugenia, of yourself;
be as superior in your feelings as in your understand∣ing,
and remember what Addison admirably says in
one of the Spectators: “A too acute sensibility of
personal defects, is one of the greatest weaknesses of
self-love.”</P>
<P>“I should be sorry, Sir, you should attribute to
vanity what I now suffer. No! it is simply the ef∣fect
of never hearing, never knowing, that so severe
a call was to be made upon my fortitude, and there∣fore
never arming myself to sustain it.”</P>
<P>Then, suddenly, and with great emotion clasping
her hands: “O if ever I have a family of my own,”
she cried, “my first care shall be to tell my daugh∣ters
of all their infirmities! They shall be familiar,
from their childhood, to their every defect—Ah!
they must be odious indeed if they resemble their
poor mother!”</P>
<P>“My dearest Eugenia! let them but resemble you
mentally, and there is no person, whose approbation
is worth deserving, that will not love and respect
them. Good and evil are much more equally divided
in this world than you are yet aware: none possess
the first without alloy, nor the second without pallia∣tion.
Indiana, for example, now in the full bloom
of all that beauty can bestow, tell me, and ask your∣self
strictly, would you change with Indiana?”</P>
<P>“With Indiana?” she exclaimed; “O! I would
forfeit every other good to change with Indiana!
Indiana, who never appears but to be admired, who
never speaks but to be applauded.”</P>
<P>“Yet a little, yet a moment, question, and un∣derstand
yourself before you settle you would change
with her. Look forward, and look inward. Look
forward, that you may view the short life of admira∣tion
and applause for such attractions from others,
and their inutility to their possessor in every moment
of solitude or repose; and look inward, that you
<PB N="364" REF="173"/>
may learn to value your own peculiar riches, for times
of retirement, and for days of infirmity and age!”</P>
<P>“Indeed, Sir,—and pray believe me, I do not
mean to repine I have not the beauty of Indiana; I
know and have always heard her loveliness is beyond
all comparison. I have no more, therefore, thought
of envying it, than of envying the brightness of the
sun. I knew, too, I bore no competition with my
sisters; but I never dreamt of competition. I knew
I was not handsome, but I supposed many people
besides not handsome, and that I should pass with the
rest; and I concluded the world to be full of people
who had been sufferers as well as myself, by disease or
accident. These have been occasionally my passing
thoughts; but the subject never seized my mind; I
never reflected upon it all, till abuse, without pro∣vocation,
all at once opened my eyes, and shewed me
to myself! Bear with me, then, my father, in this
first dawn of terrible conviction! Many have been
unfortunate,—but none unfortunate like me! Many
have met with evils—but who with an accumulation
like mine!”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, extremely affected, embraced her
with the utmost tenderness: “My dear, deserving,
excellent child,” he cried, “what would I not en∣dure,
what sacrifice not make, to soothe this cruel
disturbance, till time and your own understanding
can exert their powers?” then, while straining her
to his breast with the fondest parental commiseration,
the tears, with which his eyes were overflowing, be∣dewed
her cheeks.</P>
<P>Eugenia felt them, and, sinking to the ground,
pressed his knees. “O my father,” she cried, “a
tear from your revered eyes afflicts me more than all
else! Let me not draw forth another, lest I should
become not only unhappy, but guilty. Dry them
up, my dearest father—let me kiss them away.”</P>
<P>“Tell me, then, my poor girl, you will struggle
against this ineffectual sorrow! Tell me you will assert
that fortitude which only waits for your exertion; and
tell me you will forgive the misjudging compassion
which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eared to impress you earlier with pain!”</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="174"/>
“I will do all, every thing you desire! my injus∣tice
is subdued! my complaints shall be hushed! you
have conquered me, my beloved father! Your in∣dulgence,
your le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity shall take place of every hard∣ship,
and leave me nothing but filial affection!”</P>
<P>Seizing this grateful moment, he then required of
her to relinquish her melancholy scheme of seclusion
from the world: “The shyness and the fears which
gave birth to it,” said he, “will but grow upon you
if listened to; and they are not worthy the courage
I would instil into your bosom—the courage, my Eu∣genia,
of virtue—the courage to pass by, as if un∣heard,
the insolence of the hard-hearted, and igno∣rance
of the vulgar. Happiness is in your power,
though beauty is not; and on that to set too high a
value would be pardonable only in a weak and frivo∣lous
mind; since, whatever is the involuntary admi∣ration
with which it meets, every estimable quality
and accomplishment is attainable without it: and
though, which I cannot deny, its immediate influ∣ence
is universal, yet in every competition and in
every decision of esteem, the superior, the elegant,
the better part of mankind give their suffrages to
merit alone. And you, in particular, will find your∣self,
through life, rather the more than the less va∣lued,
by every mind capable of justice and compas∣sion,
for misfortunes which no guilt has-incurred.”</P>
<P>Observing her now to be softened, though not ab∣solutely
consoled, he rang the bell, and begged the
servant, who answered it, to request his brother
would order the coach immediately, as he was ob∣liged
to return home; “And you, my love,” said
he, “shall accompany me; it will be the least exer∣tion
you can make in first breaking through your
averseness to quit the house.”</P>
<P>Eugenia would not resist; but her compliance was
evidently repugnant to her inclination; and in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
to the glass to put on her hat, she turned aside from
it in shuddering, and hid her face with both her
hands.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="175"/>
“My dearest child,” cried Mr. Tyrold, wrapping
her again in his arms, “this strong susceptibility will
soon wear away; but you cannot be too speedy nor
too firm in resisting it. The omission of what never
was in our power cannot cause remorse, and the be∣wailing
what never can become in our power cannot
afford comfort. Imagine but what would have been
the fate of Indiana, had your situations been reversed,
and had she, who can never acquire your capacity,
and therefore never attain your knowledge, lost that
beauty which is her all; but which to you, even if
retained, could have been but a secondary gift. How
short will be the reign of that all! how useless in
sickness! how unavailing in solitude! how inade∣quate
to long life! how forgotten, or repiningly re∣membered
in old age! You will live to feel pity for
all you now covet and admire; to grow sensible to a
lot more lastingly happy in your own acquirements
and powers; and to exclaim, with contrition and
wonder. Time was when I would have changed with
the poor mind-dependent Indiana!”</P>
<P>The carriage was now announced; Eugenia, with
reluctant steps, descended; Camilla was called to
join them, and Sir Hugh saw them set off with the
utmost delight.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="41" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XLI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Strictures on Beauty.</HEAD>
<P>TO lengthen the airing, Mr. Tyrold ordered the
carriage by a new road; and to induce Eugenia to
break yet another spell, in walking as well as riding,
he proposed their alighting, when they came to a
lane, and leaving the coach in waiting while they
took a short stroll.</P>
<P>He walked between his daughters a considerable
way, passing, wherever it was possible, close to cot∣tages,
<PB N="367" REF="176"/>
labourers, and children. Eugenia submitted
with a sigh, but held down her head, affrighted at
every fresh object they encountered, till, upon ap∣proaching
a small miserable hut, at the door of which
several children were playing, an unlucky boy called
out, “O come! come! look!—here's the little
hump-back gentlewoman!”</P>
<P>She then, clinging to her father, could not stir
another step, and cast upon him a look of appeal
and reproach that almost overset him; but, after
speaking to her some words of kindness, he urged
her to go on, and alone, saying, “Throw only a
shilling to the senseless little crew, and let Camilla
follow and give nothing, and see which will become
the most popular.”</P>
<P>They both obeyed, Eugenia fearfully and with
quickness casting amongst them some silver, and Ca∣milla
quietly walking on.</P>
<P>“O, I have got a sixpence!” cried one; “and
I've got a shilling!” said another; while the mother
of the little tribe came from her wash tub, and called
out, “God bless your ladyship!” and the father
quitted a little garden at the side of his cottage, to
bow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> down to the ground, and cry, “Heaven re∣ward
you, good madam! you'll have a blessing go
with you, go where you will!”</P>
<P>The children then, dancing up to Camilla, begged
her charity; but when, seconding the palpable in∣tention
of her father, she said she had nothing for
them, they looked highly dissatisfied, while they re∣doubled
their blessings to Eugenia.</P>
<P>“See, my child,” said Mr. Tyrold, now joining
them, “how cheaply preference, and even flattery,
may be purchased!”</P>
<P>“Ah, Sir!” she answered, recovered from her
terror, yet deep in reflection, “this is only by bri∣bery,
and gross bribery, too! And what pleasure, or
what confidence can accrue from preference so earned!”</P>
<P>“The means, my dear Eugenia, are not beneath
the objects: if it is only from those who unite na∣tive
hardness with uncultured minds and manners,
<PB N="368" REF="177"/>
that civility is to be obtained by such sordid materials,
remember, also, it is from such only it can ever fail
you. In the lowest life, equally with the highest,
wherever nature has been kind, sympathy springs
spontaneously for whatever is unfortunate, and re∣spect
for whatever seems innocent. Steel yourself,
then, firmly to withstand attacks from the cruel and
unfeeling, and rest perfectly secure you will have none
other to apprehend.”</P>
<P>The clear and excellent capacity of Eugenia, com∣prehended
in this lesson, and its illustration, all the
satisfaction Mr. Tyrold hoped to impart! and she
was ruminating upon it with abated despondence,
when, as they came to a small house, surrounded with
a high wall, Mr. Tyrold, looking through an iron
gate at a female figure who stood at one of the win∣dows,
exclaimed—“What a beautiful creature! I
have rarely, I think seen a more perfect face.”</P>
<P>Eugenia felt so much hurt by this untimely sight,
that, after a single glance, which confirmed the truth
of what he said, she bent her eyes another way;
while Camilla herself was astonished that her kind
father should call their attention to beauty, at so sore
and critical a juncture.</P>
<P>“The examination of a fine picture,” said he,
fixing his eyes upon the window, and standing still at
the iron gate, “is a constant as well as exquisite plea∣sure;
for we look at it with an internal security, that
such as it appears to us to-day, it will appear again
to-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow; but in
the pleasure given by the examination of a fine face,
there is always, to a contemplative mind, some little
mixture of pain; an idea of its fragility steals upon
our admiration, and blends with it something like
solicitude; the consciousness how short a time we
can view it perfect, how quickly its brilliancy of
bloom will be blown, and how ultimately it will be
nothing.—”</P>
<P>“You would have me, Sir,” said Eugenia, now
raising her eyes, “learn to see beauty with uncon∣cern,
by depreciating its value? I feel your kind in∣tention,
<PB N="369" REF="178"/>
but it does not come home to me; reason∣ing
such as this may be equally applicable to any
thing else, and degrade whatever is desirable into in∣significance.”</P>
<P>“No, my dear child, there is nothing, either in
its possession or its loss, that can be compared with
beauty; nothing so evanescent, and nothing that
leaves behind it a contrast which impresses such regret.
It cannot be forgotten, since the same features still
remain, though they are robbed of their effect upon
the beholder; the same complexion is there, though
faded into a tint bearing no resemblance with its ori∣ginal
state; and the same eyes present themselves to
the view, though bereft of all the lustre that had
rendered them captivating.”</P>
<P>“Ah, Sir! this is an argument but formed for
the moment. Is not the loss of youth the same to every
body? and is not age equally unwelcome to the ugly
and to the handsome?”</P>
<P>“For activity, for strength, and for purposes of
use, certainly, my dear girl, there can be no differ∣ence;
but for motives to mental regret, there can be
no comparison. To those who are commonly mould∣ed,
the gradual growth of decay brings with it its
gradual endurance, because little is missed from day
to day; hope is not roughly chilled, nor expectation
rudely blasted; they see their friends, their connec∣tions,
their contemporaries, declining by the same
laws, and they yield to the immutable and general lot
rather imperceptibly than resignedly; but it is not so
with the beauty! her loss is not only general, but pe∣culiar;
and it is the peculiar, not the general evil,
that constitutes all hardship. Health, strength, agi∣lity,
and animal spirits, she may sorrowing feel di∣minish;
but she hears every one complain of similar
failures, and she misses them unmurmuring, though
not unlamenting; but of beauty, every declension i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
marked with something painful to self-love. The
change manifested by the mirror might patiently be
horne; but the change manifested in the eyes of
<PB N="370" REF="179"/>
every beholder; gives a shock that does violence to
every pristine feeling.”</P>
<P>“This may certainly, Sir, be cruel; trying at
least; but then,—what a youth has she first passed!
Mortification comes upon her, at least, in succession;
she does not begin the world with it,—a stranger at
all periods to any thing happier!”</P>
<P>“Ah, my child! the happiness caused by personal
attractions pays a dear after-price! The soldier who
enters the field of battle requires not more courage,
though of a different nature, than the faded beauty
who enters an assembly room. To be wholly disre∣garded,
after engaging every eye; to be unassisted,
after being habituated to seeing crowds anxiously offer
their services; to be unheard, after monopolising
every ear—can you, indeed, persuade yourself a
change such as this demands but ordinary firmness?
Yet the altered female who calls for it, has the least
chance to obtain it; for even where nature has en∣dowed
her with fortitude, the world and its flatteries
have almost uniformly enervated it, before the season
of its exertion.”</P>
<P>“All this may be true,” said Eugenia, with a
sigh; “and to me, however sad in itself, it may
prove consolatory; and yet—forgive my sincerity,
when I own—I would purchase a better appearance
at any price, any expence, any payment, the world
could impose!”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold was preparing an answer, when the
door of the house, which he had still continued fac∣ing,
was opened, and the beautiful figure, which
had for some time retired from the window, rushed
suddenly upon a lawn before the gate against which
they were leaning.</P>
<P>Not seeing them, she sat down upon the grass,
which she plucked up by hands full, and strewed over
her fine flowing hair.</P>
<P>Camilla, fearing they should seem impertinent,
would have retreated; but Eugenia, much struck,
sadly, yet with earnestness, compelled herself to re∣gard
the object before her, who was young, fair, of
<PB N="371" REF="180"/>
a tall and striking figure, with features delicately re∣gular.</P>
<P>A sigh, not to be checked, acknowledged how
little either reasoning or eloquence could subdue a
wish to resemble such an appearance, when the young
person, flinging herself suddenly upon her face, threw
her white arms over her head, and sobbed aloud with
violence.</P>
<P>Astonished, and deeply concerned, Eugenia inter∣nally
said, alas! what a world is this! even beauty
so exquisite, without waiting for age or change, may
be thus miserable!</P>
<P>She feared to speak, lest she should be heard; but
she looked up to her father, with an eye that spoke
concession, and with an interest for the fair afflicted,
which seemed to request his assistance.</P>
<P>He motioned to her to be quiet; when the young
person, abruptly half rising, burst into a fit of loud,
shrill, and discordant laughter.</P>
<P>Eugenia now, utterly confounded, would have
drawn her father away; but he was intently engaged
in his observations, and steadily kept his place.</P>
<P>In two minutes, the laugh ceased all at once, and
the young creature, hastily rising, began turning
round with a velocity that no machine could have ex∣ceeded.</P>
<P>The sisters now fearfully interchanged looks that
shewed they thought her mad, and both endeavoured
to draw Mr. Tyrold from the gate, but in vain; he
made them hold by his arms, and stood still.</P>
<P>Without seeming giddy, she next began to jump;
and he now could only detain his daughters, by shew∣ing
them the gate, at which they stood, was locked.</P>
<P>In another minute, she perceived them, and, com∣ing
eagerly forward, dropt several low courtesies, say∣ing,
at every fresh bend—“Good day!—Good
day!—Good day!”</P>
<P>Equally trembling, they now both turned pale
with fear; but Mr. Tyrold, who was still immov∣able,
answered her by a bow, and asked if she were
well.</P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="181"/>
“Give me a shilling!” was her reply, while the
slaver drivelled unrestrained from her mouth, render∣ing
utterly disgusting a chin that a statuary might
have wished to model.</P>
<P>“Do you live at this house?” said Mr. Tyrold.</P>
<P>“Yes, please—yes, please—yes, please,” she an∣swered,
twenty times following, and almost black in
the face before she would allow herself to take another
breath.</P>
<P>A cat now appearing at the door, she seized it,
and tried to twine it round her neck with great fond∣ling,
wholly unresisting the scratches which tore her
fine skin.</P>
<P>Next, capering forward with it towards the gate,
“Look! look!” she cried, “here's puss!—here's
puss!—here's puss!”</P>
<P>“Then, letting it fall, she tore her handkerchief
off her neck, put it over her face, strained it as tight
as she was able, and tied it under her chin; and then
struck her head with both her hands, making a noise
that resembled nothing human.</P>
<P>“Take, take me away, my father!” cried Eu∣genia,
“I see, I feel your awful lesson! but impress
it no further, lest I should die in receiving it!”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold immediately moved off without speak∣ing;
Camilla, penetrated for her sister, observed the
same silence; and Eugenia, hanging upon her father,
and absorbed in profound rumination, only by the
depth of her sighs made her existence known; and
thus, without the interchange of a word, slowly and
pensively they walked back to the carriage.</P>
<P>Eugenia broke the silence as soon as they were
seated: “O, my father!” she exclaimed, “what a
sight have you made me witness! how dread a re∣proof
have you given to my repining spirit! Did
you know this unhappy beauty was at that house?
Did you lead me thither purposely to display to me
her shocking imbecility?”</P>
<P>“Relying upon the excellence of your under∣standing,
I ventured upon an experiment more pow∣erful,
I well knew, than all that reason could urge;
<PB N="373" REF="182"/>
an experiment not only striking at the moment, but
which, by playing upon the imagination, as well as
convincing the judgment, must make an impression
that can never be effaced. I have been informed, for
some time, that this poor girl was in our neighbour∣hood;
she was born an ideot, and therefore, having
never known brighter days, is insensible to her ter∣rible
state. Her friends are opulent, and that house
is taken, and a woman is paid, to keep her in exist∣ence
and in obscurity. I had heard of her uncom∣mon
beauty, and when the news reached me of my
dear Eugenia's distress, the idea of this meeting oc∣curred
to me; I rode to the house, and engaged the
woman to detain her unfortunate charge at the win∣dow
till we appeared, and then to let her loose into
the garden. Poor, ill fated young creature! it has
been, indeed, a melancholy sight.”</P>
<P>“A sight,” cried Eugenia, “to come home to
me with shame!—O, my dear Father! your pre∣scription
strikes to the root of my disease!—shall I
ever again dare murmur!—will any egotism ever
again make me believe no lot so hapless as my own!
I will think of her when I am discontented; I will
call to my mind this spectacle of human degradation
—and submit, at least with calmness, to my lighter
evils and milder fate.”</P>
<P>“My excellent child! this is just what I expected
from the candour of your temper, and the rectitude
of your sentiments. You have seen, here, the value
of intellects in viewing the horrour of their loss; and
you have witnessed, that beauty, without mind, is
more dreadful than any deformity. You have seized
my application, and left me nothing to enforce; my
dear, my excellent child! you have left for your fond
Father nothing but tender approbation. With the
utmost thankfulness to Providence, I have marked
from your earliest childhood, the native justness of
your understanding; which, with your studious in∣clination
to sedentary accomplishments, has proved a
reviving <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ource of consolation to your mother and to
me, for the cruel accidents we have incessantly la∣mented.
<PB N="374" REF="183"/>
How will that admirable mother rejoice in
the recital I have to make to her! What pride will
she take in a daughter so worthily her own, so re∣sembling
her in nobleness of nature, and a superior
way of thinking! Her tears, my child, like mine,
will thank you for your exertions! she will strain you
to her fond bosom, as your father strains you at this
moment!”</P>
<P>“Yes, Sir,” cried Eugenia, “your kind task is
now completed with your vanquished Eugenia! her
thoughts, her occupations, her happiness, shall hence∣forth
all be centered in filial gratitude and content∣ment.”</P>
<P>The affectionate Camilla, throwing her arms about
them both, bathed each with the tears of joy and
admiration, which this soothing conclusion to an ad∣venture
so severe excited.</P>
