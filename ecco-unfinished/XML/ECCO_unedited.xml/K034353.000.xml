<L>Are those, who have abus'd the Sovereign Power.</L>
<L>Why shines the Sun, why do the Seasons change,</L>
<L>The teeming Earth lavish her yearly Store,</L>
<L>And all to bless the Sons of Men in vain?</L>
<L>O! is it not that Tyranny prevails</L>
<L>And the true End of Government is lost;</L>
<L>That those, who shou'd defend each in his Right,</L>
<L>Betray their Trust, and seize upon the Whole.</L>
<L>This, this is to rebel against that Power,</L>

<L><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE serious Bus'ness of the Night being over,</L>
<L>Pray, Ladies, your Opinion of our Lover?</L>
<L>Will you allow the Man deserves the Name.</L>
<L>Who quits his Mistress to preserve— his Fame?</L>
<L>And what was Fame in that Romantick Age?—</L>
<L>But sure such Whims ne'er were but on the Stage.</L>
<L>A Statesman rack his Brains, a Soldier fight —</L>
<L>Merely to do an injur'd People Right. —</L>
<L>What! serve his Country, and get nothing by't!</L>
<L>Why, ay, says <HI>Bays, George Castriot</HI> was the Man;</L>
<L>'Tis a known Truth—Believe him those who can.</L>
<L>Not but we've Patriots too, tho' I am told</L>
<L>There's a vast Diff'rence 'twixt the new and old:</L>
<L>Say, theirs cou'd fight, I'm sure that ours can — scold.</L>
<L>But to the Glory of the present Race,</L>
<L>No stubborn Principles their Worth debase;</L>
<L>Patriots when out, are Courtiers when in Place.</L>
<L>So, <HI>vice versa,</HI> turn a Courtier out,</L>
<L>No Weather-Cock more swiftly veers about.</L>
<L>His Country now, good Man! claims all his Care.—</L>
<L>Who'd see it plunder'd?— that's deny'd his Share.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="65"/>
<L>Since Courtiers and Anticourtiers both have shown</L>
<L>That by the Publick Good they mean their own;</L>
<L>What if each <HI>Briton,</HI> in his Private Station,</L>
<L>Should try to bilk those, who imbroil the Nation;</L>
<L>Quit either Faction, and, like Men, unite</L>
<L>To do their King and injured Country Right:</L>
<L>Both have been wrong'd: Prevent their guilty Joy,</L>
<L>Who wou'd your mutual Amity destroy.</L>
<L>Wou'd you preserve your Freedom? guard his Throne,</L>
<L>Who makes your Peace and Happiness his own.</L>
<L>Wou'd you be grateful? let your Monarch know</L>
<L>Which Way you wou'd be best, and make him so.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But soft! methinks, I hear some Fops complain;</L>
<L>Who came prepared to give the Ladies Pain,</L>
<L>That they have dress'd and spent—Gad's Curse—three Hours in vain.</L>
<L>No Hints obscene, improved by their broad Stare,</L>
<L>Have given Confusion to the tortured Fair.</L>
<L>We own the Charge. Let Monsieur <HI>Harlequin</HI></L>
<L>And his trim Troop your loose Applauses win:</L>
<L>Too much already has each modest Ear</L>
<L>Been there insulted; we'll protect them here.</L>

<L>SACRED to Virtue, Liberty, and Truth,</L>
<L>The Muses bloom in Everlasting Youth.</L>
<L>Press'd, like the Palm, they rise beneath their Weight,</L>
<L>And soar above the Reach of Time, or Fate.</L>
<L>When Brass, or Marble, faithless to their Trust,</L>
<L>No longer bear the Name, nor guard the Dust</L>
<L>Of Kings, or Heroes, to their Charge consign'd,</L>
<L>But yield to Age, and leave no Track behind;</L>
<L>The Poet's Pen, with never dying Lays;</L>
<L>Preserves their Fame and celebrates their Praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let Artful <HI>Maro,</HI> or bold <HI>Lucan</HI> tell,</L>
<L>How regal <HI>Troy,</HI> or <HI>Rome,</HI> more awfull, fell;</L>
<L>Nations destroy'd revive, lost Empires shine,</L>
<L>And Freedom glows in each immortal Line.</L>
<L>In vain would Faction, War, or lawless Power,</L>
<L>Which marr the Patriot's Scheme, his Fame devour;</L>
<L>When Bards, by their Superior Force, can save,</L>
<L>From dark Oblivion and defeat the Grave.</L>
<L>Say, <HI>Britons,</HI> must this Art forsake your Isle,</L>
<L>And leave to vagrant Apes, her native Soil?</L>
<L>Must She, the dearest Friend that Freedom knows,</L>
<L>Driv'n from her Seat, seek Refuge with her Foes?</L>
<L>Forbid so great a Shame, and save the Age</L>
<L>From such Reproach, You Patrons of the Stage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Since well we know, there's not a Theme so dear,</L>
<L>As virtuous Freedom, to a <HI>British</HI> Ear;</L>
<L>T' indulge so just a Taste, to Night we sing</L>
<L>A Pious Hero, and a Patriot King;</L>
<L>By Nature form'd, by Providence design'd</L>
<L>To Scourge Ambition, and to right Mankind:</L>
<L>Such <HI>Castriot</HI> was. O might it but appear,</L>
<L>That he retains the least Resemblance here!</L>
<L>Should but the smallest Portion of that Fire,</L>
<L>Which fill'd his ample Breast our Scenes inspire:</L>
<L>The abject Slave, to his Reproach, shall see,</L>
<L>That such as dare deserve it, may be free:</L>
<L>And conscious Tyranny confess, with Shame,</L>
<L>That blind Ambition wanders from her Aim▪</L>
<L>While Virtue leads her Votaries to Fame.</L>
