<P>ON the evening appointed, he hastened after the opera, to the apartment of the charming Italian, who received him with transport, and had provided an elegant and expensive supper; after which the Marquis again requested her to accept of a proper establishment, but in vain: <Q>You are the lover of my “choice, (said she) all I possess is your's,
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>and my future happiness will consist in shewing you that the merit, not the for∣tune of a lover, entitles him to my ”affection.</Q> Monsieur D'Illois was enraptured with the refinement and deli∣cacy of her sentiments, and determined to seek a favourable opportunity to con∣vince her of his generosity: happily, it was not long before fortune was in this particular favourable to his wishes—he did not return home that night, and the very next morning, whilst they were sit∣ting at breakfast, there entered the room a mercer and a jeweller, who, after having properly apologized for their intrusion, <Q>“We called, Madam (said they) to know whether you have any commands for us, this being the time of year we have been always honoured with your ”orders.</Q> <Q>It is true, (said the disinte∣rested “fair one) but I have been parti∣cularly
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>unfortunate, my salary has not been regularly paid; I am poor and cannot afford what I used to do, as you well know I never accept of presents from any one, therefore, have not the resources of interested women: I am now engaged; if you will return when this gentleman is gone, I will look over the articles you have brought, and supply myself with what I can pay for, as debts, you know, are my aversion; but pray, go now, as I shall not buy ”any thing whilst the Marquis is here.</Q> Monsieur D'Illois declared, he positively liked to see fine things, and wished to be a judge of her taste, and used so many entreaties, that at last she consented he should stay. The mercer unfolded seve∣ral rich fashionable silks; the jeweller displayed watches, rings, snuff boxes, lockets, and trinkets of various sorts;
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>the lady saw several she liked, but observed they were all too dear: the Marquis, on the contrary, declared he thought the prices very reasonable, and begged her acceptance of any toys or silks she wished to have, but she protested against it with great firm∣ness, and refused every thing he offered; at length she drew the mercer towards the window to agree with him for the price of a silk, and whilst she was so en∣gaged, Monsieur d'Illois gave the jeweller his address, with strict orders that he should suffer her to select what articles she liked, and, on his return home, ordered him to send the bill to the Marquis's steward, who would discharge it imme∣diately. Whilst she was talking with the jeweller, he practised the same artifice with the mercer, but not so secretly but she discovered the deceit, to her infi∣nite
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>regret, as she had chosen several things of each; but vain were all her ge∣nerous resolutions, as the tradesmen were gone, and the valet who was sent after them could not overtake them; and, as if every thing united to distress her, they were travelling merchants who came from a distant province, and she knew not where they were to be met with. Thus the Marquis had the satisfaction of pre∣senting his charmer with the value of twenty thousand francs, and yet returned home with the sincerest admiration of her disinterested love, and fully convinced of the great generosity of her sentiments.</P>

<P>THE Marquis regretted not sums so spent, however considerable, whilst they satisfied his caprices, and he kept his three mistresses in great splendor, though he had such a variety of engage∣ments that he seldom visited any of them; and whenever he went to his little dancer, he was obliged to use some kind of pre∣caution in his introduction, for she had made him promise never to come but by night, and without a carriage, <Q>That “the only foible in her character (she told him) might be still a secret to ”the neighbours.</Q> The Marquis, who was good natured, was easily prevailed on to gratify her in this particular, besides an air of mystery in an intrigue was a
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>novelty he did not dislike; he used, therefore, to go to her on foot, wrapt up in a long cloak after midnight, and letting himself in at a garden gate, creep softly to her apartment, and this only when it had been regulated between them the day before, as she could not submit to be looked upon by him as an easy fair one who must submit to receive his vi∣sits whenever he pleased. Indeed, so rare is it to possess an opera dancer who admits only one lover, that such a phae∣nomenon ought to be treated with un∣common tenderness and delicacy.</P>

<P>IN one of these nocturnal visits, the Marquis was extremely surprised to find his Adelaide bathed in tears; in vain did she endeavour to wear a smile on his appearance, and dissemble her sorrows, whilst the officious mama strove without success to administer consolation to the weeping beauty. Alarmed at her despair, Monsieur D'Illois insisted on being made acquainted with her grief, but she return∣ed no other answer than sighs; the Marquis at length conjured her not to conceal the cause any longer, and swore most solemnly he would do all in in his power to dissipate her uneasiness, and make her happy. Overcome by these promises she wiped her lovely eyes, and looking tenderly on him, <Q>I am,
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>“(said she) indeed, distressed and un∣happy to the last degree; all my com∣panions at the theatre despise me, and treat me with a contempt I cannot bear; they laugh at me, and say my appearance is a discredit to them, nor can I deny it, as they are most of them covered with jewels, have each rich bracelets, superb necklaces, and large diamond ear-rings, whilst I have only two or three shabby brilliant pins, which look so miserably when com∣pared with their's, that I blush when∣ever I am forced to place myself by them on the stage; and this night (to complete my mortification), little Vic∣toria, who is frightfully ugly, came in, adorned with a suit of diamonds that ought to have been mine, for they were given her by that booby of an English lord who made proposals
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>to me: when I saw her thus orna∣mented I was ready to sink with shame and confusion, and I believe it will ”break my heart.</Q> She again burst into tears, and the Marquis vainly en∣deavoured to pacify her, 'till at length distressed by her uneasiness, he swore to her, that the next evening she should surpass her companions in magnificence as well as beauty. The sudden revolution this promise made in the fair one's dis∣position was astonishing; she became lively, gay and entertaining, and charm∣ed the Marquis so much, that after he quitted her next morning, he went in∣stantly to his jeweller's, and sent by a faithful valet to her toilette, a shagreen case, the richness and beauty of it's con∣tents soon banished all sorrows, and left her not any reason to envy Victoria, or any other of her companions.</P>

<P>THE Marchioness d' Illois whom we left very angry with her favourite the Abbé, from that time despised him very sincerely, and on his part the blows and indignity he had suffered on her ac∣count, made him hate her most cordially; the only question on the side of the Mar∣chioness was, who should succeed him? The certainty of her connection with the Abbé, the levity of her conduct, and beauty of her person drew round her numbers of gay, dissipated young men of fashion, who had reason to hope her fa∣vours might without much difficulty be obtained; the general homage paid to her charms embarrassed her in her choice, and though her determination was to ac∣cept a lover, it was for some time diffi∣cult to say which was the happy man she intended to prefer.</P>

<P>AT last, however, it happened that the Marchioness one evening at a ball, at a friend's house, met with the Vis∣count De l'Encluse; he was a tall boy, just turned of nineteen, in the bloom of youth; the lustre of health glowed on his cheeks; an animated complexion, sparkling eyes, and white even teeth, gained him the admiration of most of the ladies; he was well shaped for his size, but rather inclined to fat, he was audacious, lively and familiar in his be∣haviour among women, and most of those with whom he conversed, liked him the better for the impertinence with which he addressed them: his character was
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>not so amiable as his figure; he was both malicious and spiteful, would repeat and propagate scandal of those to whom he professed friendship; was particularly sati∣rical on the conduct of women, as his ad∣ventures among the worthless part of the sex had been so many that he had from thence imbibed an illiberal notion of all. This was the man with whom Madame D'Illois became captivated at first sight; she thought him the most entertaining, agreeable creature in the world, and as he treated her with very little ceremony, she encouraged him by laughing at the scandalous anecdotes he told of her ac∣quaintance, and permitted him great li∣berties in his conversation, not doubting but when she chose to assume a different mode of behaviour, she could easily awe him into a proper respect; but the Vis∣count was too much used to the advances
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>of the ladies, not to perceive the impression he had made on the Marchioness, or to be so easily repulsed: her partiality to him was too apparent to be denied, he therefore at∣tached himself to her, and the Marchio∣ness already more than half vanquished by the depravity of her own inclination, yielded in a very short time to her new lover, and became as compleatly ridicu∣lous towards him in her behaviour as any of those unfortunate women whose his∣tories he had entertained her with.</P>

<P>THE Viscount, by a very extraordi∣nary effort and most surprising ta∣citurnity, kept the secret of his conquest over Madame D'Illois for three whole days, at the end of which he was un∣able to resist the pleasure of relating it to some of his intimate friends, (after taking the precaution to swear them to secresy, which they doubtless observed with the same delicacy he had done him∣self); but grown more negligent in a few days after, when he had finished his usual bottle of champaigne, <Q>Come, (he would “say) let us drink a bumper to poor little D'Illois, the best woman in the world, and so partial to me that it is astonishing; my acquaintance with her has been so short, that I am sur∣prized
<PB N="20" REF="20"/>myself at the rapidity of my success. I may say with Caesar, I came, saw, and conquered. I have not the honour of knowing the lady's husband, but I am sure he has the most easy, gentle-temper'd wife in Pa∣ris.”</Q> Not content with treating her name with so little reserve amongst his companions, he prevailed on Madame D'Illois to give him her picture, which she readily granted, and looked on the request as a proof of his passion, little suspecting the purpose for which he in∣tended it.</P>

<HEAD>FOLLY CXLII.</HEAD>
<P>SOON after, the Marquis happened to meet the Viscount at a joyous supper, at the house of a friend; they were mutually pleased with each other's conversation; and the Marquis being much too polite ever to mention the name of his wife, most of the company (and the Viscount amongst the rest) looked upon him as a single man; be∣fore they parted, the Viscount engaged the whole party to spend the following evening at his house. They met at the time appointed; and wit, good humour, and plenty of champaigne made them still more gay than they were the night before; mirth and wine elated the fancy of the Viscount, and he began as usual to boast the number of his triumphs over the most celebrated beauties; and even
<PB N="22" REF="22"/>went so far as to affirm, <Q>there was not “a truly virtuous woman in the world, at least not one who might not be sub∣dued by any man of person and ad∣dress, if he thought it worth his while to give himself any trouble about her; and to convince you (continued he) that <HI>Lucretia</HI>'s are in this age very rare to be met with, I will shew you the por∣traits of those whom I have found to be very different creatures, and yourselves shall judge from the number of pic∣tures in my possession, how many a monarch might obtain if he had a de∣sire to become master of the pictures of all the condescending fair ones in the ”polished nations of the universe:</Q> here he rose, and opened the door of a large elegant closet, whose walls were almost covered with pictures, and illuminated in an elegant taste; they all rushed into
<PB N="23" REF="23"/>it with impatience; and the first object that struck the sight of Monsieur d'Illois was the exact resemblance of his wife; however well-bred a husband he might be, yet it would be a dishonour to human nature not to suppose he felt a very disa∣greeable sensation at this discovery; but he disguised his emotion, and, with the calmness of a philosopher, attended to the Viscount, who enraptured at being thus surrounded with trophies so flattering to his self-love, pointed to each particular painting, and gave his friends a short, his∣tory of the fair one it resembled. <Q>The “first, gentlemen, (said he) on my right hand, is old Madame de P—; no great addition to the collection I con∣fess, but she was my first conquest among what is called virtuous ladies; she it seems had a kind of curiosity to know how a boy of sixteen
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>made love; and I, (out of a frolic) had a mind to try whether a woman of fifty would relish such a declaration: next to this old hag, (by way of con∣trast) behold the young blooming Ce∣lia; I pursued her five weeks with un∣remitting ardor, but she condescended not to reward my passion till the very day before she married my most inti∣mate friend the Count of R—: this little bewitching face (up higher) the Countess de Morun, who though she scruples not to grant favours to her lovers, has the delicacy to declare she still adores her husband with the most unabated fondness: this on your left, is the famous devotee Madame de M: who every day in public devoutly prays to heaven that she may be forgiven the sins she hourly commits in private: this haughty beauty is the Dutchess
<PB N="25" REF="25"/>De C—, who yielded to my wishes with a most petrifying air of gran∣deur; but making use of the privi∣lege of a favoured lover, and going rather abruptly into her apartment three days after, found her in the arms of a footman: that further lady, is the smiling princess of T—, who, when I hinted at noon in a whisper (after passing the night in her apart∣ment) that I should be glad to repeat the assignation, turned from me and burst into a loud laugh; told me, she wondered at my assurance, that I ought to know that a <HI>faux pas</HI> in women of her rank, was a mere jest; and that she supposed I was not to learn that nothing could be more dull than the ”repetition of a joke.</Q></P>

<HEAD>FOLLY CXLIII.</HEAD>
<P>IN this manner he ran over great numbers with the most surprising volubility, 'till he came at last to that of the Marchioness: <Q>Here! (said he, “turning to the Marquis), do you know ”this young beauty?</Q> <Q>I have seen “her (returned Monsieur D'Illois, ra∣ther embarras'd):”</Q> <Q><HI>à propos</HI> (conti∣nued “De l'Encluse) she is your name ”sake; is she a relation?</Q> <Q>very dis∣tantly, “”said the Marquis;</Q> <Q>so much “the better, (cried the Viscount) I shan't lose my story for all that; these little sparkling eyes and coquettish airs an∣nounce the vivacity of the disposition
<PB N="27" REF="27"/>of the Marchioness D'Illois; and in truth so very lively is she, that she has scarce patience to wait for the offer of her lover's heart, before she takes pains to convince him she means to accept of his person; I speak from ex∣perience: three days from the hour I first saw her, arranged matters between her and me; but then I must do her the justice to say, she received an im∣pression in my favour at first sight; she is a charming, dissipated, lively creature—but I have had her these ten days; and if it were to continue ten days longer; I should think myself mar∣ried to her—I would advise you, D'Illois, faith, to begin where I leave off. She would suit you exactly—her beauties are worthy a particular exami∣nation; come, you shall have a nearer ”view of my little goddess.</Q> He then
<PB N="28" REF="28"/>took down the picture, and gave it into the hand of the Marquis, who endea∣voured to look upon it with a smile, when at that very instant there entered a young man, a relation to Monsieur D'Illois, just come from college. <Q>Ah! (said he “to the Marquis) what do I see! my ”dear cousin enraptured with the por∣trait of his own wife. I never saw any thing so like since I was born.</Q> At this unexpected discovery the Viscount started with surprize, and seemed covered with confusion, and bursting into a loud laugh, <Q>“Well, gentlemen, said he, my blun∣dering cousin here has discovered to you the husband of the complaisant lady whose history you have heard; but be assured, her conduct gives me not the least disquiet, we are very hap∣py people, and each amuse ourselves our own way: I am not in the least
<PB N="29" REF="29"/>angry with the Viscount for endea∣vouring to make himself agreeable to a pretty woman because she is my wife; and one day or other, when he is so imprudent as to marry, I shall hope to return the compliment which is the only way I shall ever think of revenging the wrongs he has done ”me.</Q> He then shook hands with the Viscount, and every one present declar∣ed he was a noble fellow, praised the manner in which he had received this in∣telligence to the skies, and unanimously agreed none but a fool would make him∣self the least uneasy about the conduct of a woman. <Q>But what devil, (said the “Marquis) brought you, cousin of the woeful countenance, hither at so critical ”a juncture?</Q> <Q>A most unaccountable “adventure, upon my honour (said the young man) I have been nearly terri∣fied
<PB N="30" REF="30"/>out of my senses, and seeing your carriage waiting at this door, was glad to come in to recover my surprise; and believe me, when you have heard what I have to say, you will own my fears have not been without foun∣dation.”</Q></P>

<P>MYSELF and three other collegi∣ans, you must know, my dear cousin (said the intruder, whose name was the Chevalier D'Iricourt,) have been spending an evening together at ****, who, if he does make long bills, you have at least the satisfaction of having excellent ragouts for your money: we have been at table ever since ten; and what the devil wine he gave us I cannot tell, but it got into our heads before we had drank two bottles a man, and we be∣gan to laugh and hollow, and be very rio∣tous; at last some one proposed breaking the glasses by way of frolic; when those were finished, we began on the china, then proceeded to throw three large look∣ing-glasses into the street, as we all
<PB N="32" REF="32"/>agreed nothing can be more absurd than to have looking-glasses in an eating-room, and we were then endeavouring to lift out a large, old, lumbring sopha, being resolved nothing should positively remain but the table and chairs, when our landlord made his appearance frightened out of his wits, and on his humble re∣monstrances we were prevailed upon to be quiet; those who had money, paid their share of the bill and damages, and those who had none promised faithfully to make amends when they had; and this matter being fairly settled, we marched into the street just as the clock struck two, the night so totally dark there was not a star to be seen.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="145" TYPE="folly">
<PB N="33" REF="33"/>
<HEAD>FOLLY CXLV.</HEAD>
<P>NONE of us having had the pru∣dence to order our carriages, we crept along in the dark, feeling our way, and in imminent danger of breaking our necks. <Q>Come, (said I to the rest) do “not let us go to bed at this early hour like a parcel of sneaking citi∣zens, let us be jovial, let us all go in this dirty trim to the masquerade, and our miserable appearance will save us ”the expence of a dress.</Q> They were delighted with my scheme, so on we went in mud over our shoe buckles, but praying very heartily that we might
<PB N="34" REF="34"/>soon meet with an hackney coach, to save us the remainder of so disagreeable a pe∣rigrination; after some time we heard one advancing towards us; <Q>Hollo! friend, “said we altogether, are you an hack∣ney ”coachman?</Q> "Ay, that I am, to my sorrow, gentlemen, (answered he, endea∣vouring to lash forward the wretched horsest hat dragged his coach along;) <Q>I “am full now, continued he, but as I am going only a few yards, if you will stop here I will set down my fare, and shall then be at your service for the ”rest of the night.</Q> <Q>Come (said “one of my companions) let us stop this rascal, and see who those per∣sons are who dare to ride whilst we ”are forced to walk on foot.</Q> We seconded this laudable design, seized the reins of the horses, opened the door, and my friend putting in his hand, <Q>I
<PB N="35" REF="35"/>“smoke it (said he) this is some pri∣vate decampment, there is nothing in it but furniture, so let the dog go on, and we will follow him, and get in where he sets down his lug∣gage.”</Q> He then shut the door, and though the coachman did not spare whipcord, we easily kept pace with the crazy machine which we had the pati∣ence to follow through at least a dozen streets, expecting every moment he would be at his journey's end. He came at last into this very street, and stopped before a little narrow gate-way which leads into a blind alley, a very few yards from hence, and drove up so very close to the wall, that I, who happen∣ed to be the only one of the party on that side of the way, was forced to turn into a little alley to avoid the wheels: the obscurity of the place made
<PB N="36" REF="36"/>it impossible for me to be perceived, and the coachman believing us all on the other side of the way, got down, and opened the coach door; a man imme∣diately jumped out, and put a large bundle on his shoulders; with which the coachman came so very close to me that it brush'd against me, but with what horror and consternation was I possessed, when, by the light of a dark∣lantern (which was suddenly opened by the man at the coach side to light the other in) I plainly perceived that these pretended goods were no other than dead bodies; sometimes I was touched by the leg of one of them—at the next turn a cold dangling hand came against my face; and now and then the head of one with force against mine; the man with the lantern was so fully convinc∣ed that the coast was clear, that he never
<PB N="37" REF="37"/>turned the light in any other position but what served to gleam on their dread∣ful load, by which I discovered that each corpse was about half covered up in coarse linen cloth, just wrapped round it. Amongst others, was the body of an infant, whose face appeared swel∣led and livid. The air and mein of the wretch at the coach, encreased my appre∣hensions; he looked like a cut-throat, and under a loose horseman's coat which he wore, I could discern several daggers in a kind of belt. These wretches whilst thus employed held a conversation shock∣ing to think of; which chiefly consisted of remarks on the objects before them: there is one (said the coachman) that is scarce cold now; how devilishly strong and robust he is! he had trouble enough to get out of this world so quickly,
<PB N="38" REF="38"/>and a good struggle for it, I warrant. These sort of observations were passed on each as they lugged them in; and I own to you my fears were such, that I was myself more dead than alive at that moment; I scarce breathed, and drew myself to the wall as close as possible; at last I concluded I must un∣doubtedly be murdered if I was per∣ceived by them, and that I had better call my friends to my assistance, for the entrance was almost rendered impassable by the bodies being laid within it, in order, as I suppose, to clear the coach till they could dispose of them else∣where. I tried several times to raise my voice, but the sound died upon my tongue; at length fear, by encreasing my panic, gave me utterance, and I gave so loud and piercing a cry, that the
<PB N="39" REF="39"/>cursed coachman, and the assassin himself, both became immoveable; my friends alarmed for my fafety, ran to my assist∣ance, and turning aside the heads of the horses came into the alley, where I ex∣pected my last moment was approach∣ing. On the noise they made, the mis∣creant opened the lantern and the hor∣rid sight of so many carcases astonished them nearly as much as it had done me. <Q>“For God' sake! (said I) lay hold of that villain, who having perpetrated such a number of murders, conspires with the coachman his accomplice, to bring them hither to conceal his ”crimes.</Q> At these words, my friends laid hold of them both, and it was now their turn to become pale and trembling; they looked on each other in silence, whilst my companions interrogated them
<PB N="40" REF="40"/>with their drawn swords. I was glad to get into the street to recover my senses in a pure air, and perceiving your coach waiting at the door of the Viscount, thought I would step in and ask your advice, what ought to be done in this very extraordinary case.</P>

<P><Q>“A Very extraordinary case, indeed, (replid the Marquis) let us all go and examine this affair direct∣ly;”</Q> on which the whole company, with the Chevalier at their head, proceed∣ed to the place just as the coachman and his companion were beseeching the three friends of Monsieur D'Iricourt not to ruin them. At the arrival of so many additional witnesses they were ready to sink into the earth. <Q>Do not waste “time in talking to these wretches (said the Marquis) but take them before
<PB N="42" REF="42"/>the magistrate, who will in a proper mannerforce them to confess the crimes they have been guilty of, and inflict on them the punishment due to their ”wickedness.</Q> <Q>Ah! gentlemen, for “heaven' sake (said the person whom they looked upon as the assassin) have mercy upon me, and I declare so∣lemnly I, will own to you the whole truth: I am, then, you must know, a poor practitioner in surgery, and have, I confess, stolen from their graves those bodies, for myself and some other pupils to dissect. I beg you will forgive me, and consider, that the present war has made dead men here at home so exceedingly dear, that the grave diggers make us pay double prices for those they procure; I therefore gave this honest coach∣man a crown for his assistance, and

(said “the frightened skeleton-monger) they are only the instruments for dissection, which I called for this evening in ”my way to the burial ground.</Q> The loud laugh of the Marquis and his com∣panions now re-echoed from every side, and the whole of this adventure being turned into a jest; they rallied the Cheva∣lier most unmercifully on the panic he had endured. Chagrined and confused at their ironical compliments, and congra∣tulations on his bravery and fortitude,
<PB N="44" REF="44"/>he and his three friends were glad to jump into the hackney coach, take the places of the dead bodies, and make the best of their way to the masquerade, leaving the other gentlemen very merry at his expence.</P>

<P>THEY continued laughing till the coach was quite out of sight; the Marquis then got into his own carriage, and the coachman had already driven down two or three streets before he re∣collected he had not received his master's orders where to go; he stopped to en∣quire, and it came into the head of Mon∣sieur D'Illois that he would pay a visit to Adelaide, the little dancer; but as it has before been observed, he had pro∣mised to use precaution in his visits to that fair one. He told the coachman
<PB N="46" REF="46"/>to stop some distance from the house of his divinity, where he got out, sent home his carriage, and arrived happily at the garden gate, which he fortunately found open, from thence he softly ascended the staircase, and knocked very gently at the door of Adelaide's apartment. He waited some minutes, at last the cham∣ber maid, peeping thro' the key hole, whispered an enquiry of <Q>who was “”there? and what he wanted?</Q> when having received her answer, she again left him, under no small degree of im∣patience, and not a little surprised that he was suffered to wait an instant after telling his name, which gave him some reason to suspect the place was filled by another; at last he gained entrance, but his suspicions made him survey the room with a very inquisitive eye. Ma∣demoiselle Adelaide was in bed, and com∣plained
<PB N="47" REF="47"/>loudly of the want of conside∣ration, and incivility shewn to her by coming to disturb her repose at so late an hour; <Q>declared that the delicacy “of her constitution was such, that she could not submit to be treated with so little ceremony, and that she should be dying in the morning with the head-ach, from the terror she had been in at hearing some one knock ”at her door so late in the night.</Q> Whilst she spoke the Marquis sur∣veyed her very attentively, and thought he saw fear and inquietude in her man∣ner, which confirmed his ideas, and without making her any reply he be∣gan to search about the room with very little ceremony, in spite of all the nymph could say to prevent it. <Q>Indeed, Mar∣quis “(said she) you are extremely ri∣diculous. I do not understand this
<PB N="48" REF="48"/>treatment, I assure you; pray leave ”me— for I am really ill.</Q> The exa∣mination of every place he had hither∣to-surveyed had been so unsatisfactory that he began to believe his jealousy was groundless, when he heard some one cough in a closet just by the bed side, which had escaped his vigilance.</P>

<P>IN a variety of pleasures, they soon lost every remembrance of a woman, whose infidelities were so apparent; and they regretted not the presents they had bestowed on one so very worthless, as they agreed, they had purchased experience, and that they were very fortunate to dis∣cover her perfidy before she had plun∣dered them of more. From this time Lord Warton and the Marquis became inse∣parable friends: the young Englishman was twenty-two years old, tall, well pro∣portioned, with an air of dignity in his manner which made him an interesting figure, but his complection was so ex∣tremely fair, his eye so blue, and his features so delicate, that had not his
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>countenance been overspread with a kind of manly ruddiness, he might have passed for a woman; his hair, of which he had a profusion, appeared to be fair, but many affirmed it to be red when divested of Marechale powder. The elegance of his dress was a proof that he studied fa∣shion with the nicest exactness; and it was his particular pleasure to excel in them to the most eminent degree; as for wit, he had not by nature the smallest preten∣sions to any thing that wore the resem∣blance of it, yet, being a man of qua∣lity, his miserable puns were laughed at, his <HI>bon-mots</HI> approved, and his stories re∣peated by his acquaintance; so that upon the whole, he formed an opinion of him∣self, as a very lively, clever, sensible, entertaining fellow. One day as he and the Marquis were lolling in their arm chairs, so fatigued with a constant round
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>of dissipation, that their very existence was a burthen to them, Lord Warton undertook to amuse his friend by the recital of his travels, "Which (added he) though they have been very expensive, yet have amply repaid me by the in∣formation and knowledge of mankind which I have acquired, and, indeed, more real experience and observation than most young men of my age.</P>

<P>"THUS fully acquainted with the na∣tional character of the men, I then wished to know something of the general disposition of the women: I happened to mention my wishes on this subject to one of the smoaking fraternity, who came to drink beer and talk politics at the inn; he seemed sensible of the condescension I shewed in entering into conversation with him, and quitting his pipe in return for my politeness, requested I would accom∣pany him home for that evening, where I should see something worthy my curio∣sity: though I could not form any very

We set out and walked thither; but how great was my surprise to see him enter the gates of a magnificent palace, the outside of whose walls were painted in different colours, and within lined with beautiful China tiles, according to the custom of the Dutch; this he told me was his habita∣tion: we traversed a large court yard full of domesticks, and went up a grand marble staircase, which led to apartments most superbly furnished, and which con∣tained luxuries from every quarter of the globe; the exact neatness with which these rooms were arranged and kept in order, encreased the pleasure they gave
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>to the beholder; the floors were bright as the looking-glasses, and every piece of wood shone like silver.

<PB N="70" REF="72"/>not yet seen. <Q>This (said he) is where I “receive my company, (I was going in) but you must (continued he) pull off your shoes before you enter it; princes who do me the honour of a visit, are not exempt from this custom, and I always submit to it as shoes leave ”marks on the floor.</Q> This custom appeared to me so very ridiculous that I could scarce keep my countenance; how∣ever, both the Dutchman and myself having pulled off our shoes, we entered bare-footed into the rooms.</P>

<PB N="79" REF="83"/>The air of the Hague seemed to purify me from the grosser particles of the smoke I had contracted in Amsterdam; and I no longer met so continually those little round, oily, fat people, with faces of stupid serenity.

Ever anxious to gain an early knowledge of the man∣ners and customs of the inhabitants of the principal towns, I went on the ve∣ry first evening of my arrival, to the play at the French Theatre, and was astonished to find a troop of comedi∣ans,
<PB N="80" REF="84"/>whose language is scarce understood, should draw together a much greater number of people than the actors of their own country: from this preference of the French players, I drew this in∣ference, that the Dutch however satur∣nine by nature, yet have their whims and caprices; and that there are not any people so absolutely unpolished as not to be in some degree governed by fa∣shion. When I returned to my inn, I ordered supper in my chamber, and was asked by my landlord, if I did not pre∣fer supping in company; I readily con∣sented, and he then introduced me into a large hall, where was a table with above thirty covers. I found myself not a little embarrased on being introduced to such a number of strangers. I placed myself by the side of a young Dutch∣man who had sat near me at the play,

I was disappointed at this intelligence; my curiosity was much a∣wakened and my impatience very great till the appointed time at last arrived, and I set out with him, fully convinc∣ed that I was to be introduced to some persons of fashion, to whose assembly all persons of any consequence resorted: nor had I any reason to change my opi∣nion

I took post directly for Germany, and resolved not to stop in any but those capital towns where an elector resided, and proposed to make all possible speed to Vienna; I deigned not to enter Bruxelles, as I had learnt the co∣medians

<P>"THOUGH I greatly admired the faith of the inhabitants of Trèves, yet I had not the least wish to remain in a city where the devil was the principal architect, but continued my way to the gates of Mayence, where I was so fortu∣nate as to arrive just at the time the co∣medy was going to begin; it was a piece, (the original of which was French,) tran∣slated into German, and here I was abso∣lutely enchanted with the actress who played the principal character; her voice was clear and harmonious, with more va∣riety of notes than a nightingale, and which penetrated my very soul. Hea∣vens! how beautiful did she appear! I sat with my eyes fixed upon her, and viewed every gesture and motion with exquisite delight; I was placed at the back part of the theatre, so beheld my
<PB N="101" REF="105"/>goddess in perspective. After the per∣formance was over, I went behind the scenes to pay my homage to this beauty, and found her surrounded by a croud of admirers, who were paying her the most flattering compliments on her person and talents; it was with difficulty I could get near enough to express my approbation, and make a speech I had studied for the purpose of introducing myself to her ac∣quaintance; but how was I surprised, on my nearer survey, to find her so totally different from what I had conceived her to be! Instead of the bewitching graces of youth, I beheld a little thin woman, absolutely ugly, and at least thirty years of age, though ten minutes before I would have betted an hundred guineas that she was not more than eighteen; I could even discern that her seeming fine proportion of shape was the effect of a
<PB N="102" REF="106"/>most disgusting leanness; her forehead was not higher than the breadth of my three fingers, and her hair would have met her eye brows had she not taken great care to pull it up by the roots, which left a blackness an inch broad all the way round her face; her eyes were as far in her head as those of a French barbet; nature had not bestowed on her more than half a nose in length; to make amends for which, she had a mouth fourtimes as wide as it ought to have been, ornamented with lips that would have been of a tolerable thickness for a blacka∣moor; however, though my illusion was dissipated, yet she was I (understood) quite the fashion, and I was exactly in the humour to do some foolish thing to be talked of, therefore, finding she was the ton, I determined, though I was cured of my passion, to pursue my design: I paid
<PB N="103" REF="107"/>my devoirs to her, and finding she un∣derstood some words of English, I ad∣dressed some gallantries to her in that lan∣guage, which made her smile, and had even the assurance to follow her into her dressing room, and assist at her toilette. We were no sooner alone than I took out my purse, in which were fifty louis, and laying it on the table, told her, <Q>My “landlord at my inn had given me a chamber I did not like, and if she would suffer me to share her's for that night only, the purse and its contents ”were at her service.</Q> She pocketed my money, and her scruples, (if she had any), and with an air of childish gaiety took hold of my arm, and permitted me to conduct her home; and not one of the numerous train that before surrounded her thought it worth while to dispute my pretensions.</P>

<P>"I Had, however, the courage to pursue my resolution, and continue my way as far as Bâle, where I arrived in a very ill∣humour with both postillions and roads; and to complete my chagrin, met with an adventure at an inn there, which occa∣sioned me to curse the memory of the deceased Jean Jaques very sincerely: the appearance of Bâle was so very con∣temptible in itself, that I determined to quit it directly, and return back to the road to Vienna, without deigning to ask a single question respecting the inhabi∣tants, or even getting out of my chaise, as there could not be any thing worthy the curiosity of a gentleman in a place so
<PB N="109" REF="113"/>wholly insignificant; but on stopping to change horses, I ordered a couple of new laid eggs, which the landlord brought himself, and with the gravity of a judge expatiated on <Q>the excellent pasture of “the Thirteen Cantons, the sweetness of the milk which the cattle afforded, the goodness of the poultry in this part of the world, and above all, the deli∣cious eggs which they produced, allowed by all who ever tasted them to be so remarkably fine, that he was, (for his own par,) perfectly convinced that people in the most distant nations of the earth would never eat any other, if ”these could be conveyed to them.</Q> Wearied with this nonsense, I impatiently demanded <Q>what I was to pay for the “”two I had eaten?</Q> <Q>Cheap enough “in all conscience, (returned he) only a ”crown of six livres.</Q> Astonished at
<PB N="110" REF="114"/>the enormity of this demand, I loudly remonstrated with him for his extrava∣gant imposition; instead of abating his charge, he replied with the same gravity, and with features perfectly unmoved by all the injurious epithets I so loudly be∣stowed on him, <Q>That since I did not “know when I was well treated, he would not have less than twelve ”francs for them.</Q> I now became so exceedingly angry that I perfectly raved with passion, but that, so far from having the least effect, induced him to insist on a louis d'or for his two eggs.—<Q>I “see plainly, my friend, (said I) that you are in jest, but as I am a person of consequence I shall not submit to be trifled with, neither am I at present in such good humour as to mistake ab∣surdity ”for wit.</Q> <Q>Sir, (answered the “provoking rascal) I speak seriously;

I was once more going to reply to this dia∣bolical innkeeper, when my servant hastily entering the room to learn the cause of this disturbance, clapped his hand upon my mouth, <Q>What are you doing, (said “he) my lord? if you remonstrate thus ”much longer, you will be ruined.</Q></P>

<PB N="116" REF="120"/>imputation to lessen their demand, they ever in revenge for the insult, augment the price in proportion to the haughtiness of the behaviour of the purchaser, by which means they are completely revenged on those who wrong them by such a suspicion, as they are obliged to take the goods at the rate they choose to dispose of them, however dear they may think it; give, therefore, this honest man the twenty louis, if you do not mean ”to pass your days in prison.</Q> I found it utterly impossible at the conclusion of this fine speech, to hope for any redress, I therefore counted twenty louis on the table, (the dearest price ever paid for a couple of eggs), and most sincerely giving the justice, landlord, and every inhabitant of the Thirteen Cantons to the Devil, I got hastily into my chaise,

<PB N="121" REF="125"/>to give myself the trouble of walking over it—The elector who built it, was doubtless a man of intrigue, as there are a great number of galleries built in arches, which terminate in the houses of private persons, whom by this means he can visit incognito as often as he pleases; and it is not very improbable to suppose such secrecy was to be observed more on the account of female than male friends and favourites.</P>

<P>"AS soon as I was able to bear travelling, I pursued my way post to Vienna; but when I arrived there, could hardly believe that I was in the ca∣pital of Germany; for were it not for the suburbs, it would not be more than a little paltry town; and even the pa∣lace of the Emperor is so mean and gothic in appearance, that it seems ra∣ther a clumsy proof of the antiquity of the house of Austria, than the resi∣dence of a great monarch. Vienna seemed to afford so little entertainment, that, had I not thought it absolutely right to have it to say on my return home, that I had resided there some time, I should
<PB N="126" REF="130"/>have quitted it directly, without the least regret; and I even put a very disa∣greeable restraint upon my inclination, by my strict adherence to the inva∣riable rule I made on my first set∣ting out on my tour, to pass hastily through small towns and villages, and to lengthen my stay in all principal cities where I could meet with company, plea∣sure and dissipation. When I went to the banker on whom my bills of exchange were drawn, I found him a polite, well-bred man, and he earnestly requested me to frequent his house of an even∣ing during my stay at Vienna, where, he assured me, I should meet the most agreeable and entertaining socie∣ty that part of the world could afford: there needed but little entreaty to in∣duce me to accept his offer, as I knew

In the brilli∣ant circle of this evening assembly, I soon distinguished a very pretty wo∣man, called the Baroness, who had been a widow near a twelvemonth; I paid my court to her with the most per∣fect assiduity and attention, and endea∣voured by every method in my power to improve my acquaintance with her to the utmost advantage, always plac∣ing myself next her, applauding every thing she said, and making it a con∣stant rule never to reply in contradic∣tion however absurd her argument, or ridiculous the proposition; she observ∣ed
<PB N="128" REF="132"/>the impression her charms had made, and did not seem displeased with her conquest. One evening she suffered me to conduct her home, and I avail∣ed myself of this opportunity to dis∣cover my sentiments, and plead my passion so successfully that I obtained permission to wait on her at her own house; here I was each day more favour∣ably received, till at length she ac∣knowledged her affection for me; yet often in the midst of the most animating conversation, she would interrupt the tenderest vows of love, to prove the un∣disputed nobility of her ancestors, and it was very easy to see that my rank in life was a strong argument for my favourable reception, and raised me higher in her esteem than I should ever had reason to hope had I been but a plebeian. One day the beautiful Ger∣man

<P>"I Descended into the Milaneze, fa∣tigued to death with the slow pace the horses had been obliged to go in so mountainous a country; but the air of Italy seemed to give me new life, and I reflected with pleasure, that I should no longer associate with the phlegmatic, ceremonious Germans, but promised myself a fund of amusement from the lively petulance of the Itali∣ans. Arrived at Milan, I eagerly en∣quired what was most worthy my ob∣servation in that city? they immedi∣ately entered into a long detail of the beauty of a great number of superb edifices, and amongst the rest, a ca∣thedral
<PB N="135" REF="139"/>built, they told me, of marble of different colours, not yet finished, or∣namented with statues which have im∣mortalized the name of the first artists in Italy. As these were trifles I never at∣tended to, and if they really are what it is desireable for a man to be acquainted with, he may read as well an account of them, after his return to Eng∣land, much more accurate than he can give; and in much less time than he can see them. I therefore declined ve∣ry peremptorily to bestow the hours I had to spare on either churches or paintings; but eagerly enquired the time the opera was to begin, and went that evening to the theatre, where was to be represented an opera, written, I heard, by one Metastasio, who it seems is one of their most famous poets: the music was listewise the composition of
<PB N="136" REF="140"/>one of their most celebrated compo∣sers. In consequence of this infor∣mation, I thought myself very for∣tunate, for I had heard such praises of the performers of Italy, that I expected to be quite enchanted; but to my very great disapointment, so far from being entertained, I was quite tired before the second act was finished, and except a few airs, I thought it the most de∣testable performance I had ever seen, and am fully convinced that not any per∣son possessed of the smallest degree of understanding, can ever find any en∣tertainment in their dull recitavo and re∣petitions without end.; however, all the persons near whom I was placed, affect∣ed infinite pleasure, and were hoarse with calling out bravo! bravo! whilst I kept a profound and contemptuous silence, except now and then yawning most dread∣fully
<PB N="137" REF="141"/>in spite of every effort to prevent it, as it was with the greatest difficulty I kept from sleeping. When it was over (weary to death, and my ears aching with the fatigue of listening to the war∣bling quavers of a set of effeminate wretches, metamorphosed into kings, heroes and conquerors) I rose from my seat, and said aloud in English (which I did not suppose any one there under∣stood) <Q>What cursed music it is! “well worth the trouble, truly, to come so far to hear such a jargon ”of sounds!</Q> when I had uttered these words, a man muffled in a long cloak, who was in the next box, looked at me in a very particular manner, and I learnt afterwards, that he perfectly understood the sense of my exclama∣tion: this person followed me out, and walked behind me a few paces till we
<PB N="138" REF="142"/>came into an unfrequented street, when he suddenly drew a poignard and stab∣bed me in the back in two or three places, telling me at the same time, <Q>he “gave it me to cure the defect in my ”ears;</Q> this new method of teaching music, was so dextrously applied, and by so masterly a hand, that I had not time to parry the blow, but fell senseless at his feet; when I came to myself, my groans drew the attention of some charitable persons who were passing; they took me up, carried me to the nearest inn, which prov∣ed to be that from which I came, and which I had preferred on account of its vicinity to the theatre; when I was able, I related to my host the ac∣cident which had befallen me; but when he heard the provocation I had given by my soliloquy, he asured me I had

I put on the same domino and masque that I had worn the evening before, when I had walked for some considerable time, I felt somebody tap me on the shoulder, and turning hastily I saw behind me a gondolier, ele∣gantly neat in his dress, leaning on his oar, which was painted with a variety

I was going to enquire his business with me, but he prevented me, by saying, <Q>By your graceful air, I am “”convinced I speak to Lord Warton.</Q> "I acknowledged he did so." <Q>Here, “then (said he) is a billet I have orders to deliver into your own hands—read it, and you will find, that the ladies of this country are not very cruel to strangers, and only require in return for their favours, secrecy and discre∣tion.”</Q> I hastily opened the note, and read these words:</P>

After waiting some time, I became very impatient, at last my conduc∣ress returned, and took me into a cham∣ber, most splendidly illuminated; the door of which being opened on a sudden, my eyes were dazzled with the number of lights, and richness of the furniture, but I no longer paid any attention to this mag∣nificence, when I saw advance towards me a tall woman, whose easy shape and ma∣jestic air (though covered with a long veil) attracted all my admiration; this I doubted not was the beautiful creature

The women of our nation go great lengths in love in a short time, but the reason is obvious,
<PB N="162" REF="166"/>the continual restraint we are under, obliges us to renounce those little <HI>dou∣ceurs,</HI> which may be properly called the prelude to affection, and give the women in happier climates, time to capitulate, and surrender in form; here it is impossible to improve friend∣ship into love, we therefore begin with the latter, and this is all our wise husbands gain by their jealousy and precaution, and thus they abso∣lutely advance the misfortune they en∣deavour to prevent, and render us more condescending to the addresses of our lovers.

It was insisted upon by my <HI>Ciceroni</HI> that I should enter the library, in which it is said there are a great number of valu∣able manuscripts; the only observation I shall make on this subject is a very short one, which is, <Q>that if there are, they had “much better be published to the world than let them remain there useless: in∣deed, a large library serves not any other purpose than to mortify the ig∣norant, by shewing them what they might have known; and great scholars the very little share of knowledge they ”have been able to acquire.</Q> As we were returning home, we were stopped by a very great crowd, who seemed to be
<PB N="178" REF="182"/>assembled to see some extraordinary sight; before I had time to enquire the reason, we perceived a great number of coaches at a distance, drawn by horses, richly harnassed, and followed by several ser∣vants on foot; the carriages were full of ladies and gentlemen, elegantly dressed, and the smiles of mirth and good humour which enlivened their countenance, seem∣ed to proclaim their satisfaction, and indi∣cate that they were going to celebrate some festival. <Q>What (said I) is the “meaning of this numerous procession thus adorned? Is it the entry of an ”ambassador?</Q> <Q>So far from it, (said “the Florentine) it is a young woman ”going to take the veil.</Q></P>

<P>"THIS answer seemed to me a very unaccountable one; as I had ever looked upon a young woman thus situated, as a victim whom the cru∣elty or avarice of her parents had reduced to submit to a dreadful imprisonment for life, and it was absolutely impossible to reconcile an idea so very opposite, with the apparent mirth of the joyous troop before me. <Q>You are, I perceive, ab∣solutely “incredulous (said the <HI>Ciceroni</HI>) but I am determined that you shall be convinced of the manner in which our nuns make their profession. I am intimately acquainted with some of the young lady's relations, and they will look on the company of a stranger on
<PB N="180" REF="184"/>this occasion, as a particular favour; this is the last day of the cavalcade, and they are going with the future nun to shew her whatever is worth seeing in this city before her retire∣ment; we will, if you please, follow them directly, and be witness to the ceremony: if you are astonished to see them so merry now, before the day is over you will be infinitely more sur∣prised.”</Q> We looked about, and fol∣lowed the procession, and thus paraded several streets, lined with spectators, and stopped at the gate of a palace, where the whole company retired. As this was the habitation of the lady's father, my conductor presented me to the master of the house as his friend, and I was per∣mitted the honour of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aluting the future vestal, who wore a great number of very fine jewels, and was adorned with all the

We had an excellent dinner, at which the beauti∣ful nun drank very freely with the gen∣tlemen who requested her to grant them that favour, and joined in several <HI>chansons à boire</HI> very devoutly. After this repast the coaches were again ordered, and I presumed that some very pious act of religion was to consecrate the remainder of the day, but on the contrary, the nun and the whole company were carried to the theatre, where it is most probable they only waited our arrival to begin, as they instantly drew up the curtain, and began a serious opera, but in the midst of the second act, our party again rose up, and went from thence to the comic opera, and from thence to a third, where they played an Italian farce; and the <HI>bon
<PB N="182" REF="186"/>mots</HI> of harlequin, though not always consistent with the strictest delicacy, seem∣ed to entertain the young lady ex∣ceedingly, as she laughed louder than any other person; here we staid till it was entirely finished, and then returned to the palace.</P>

I had no sooner settled this important point, than my conductor desired leave to wait on me the following morning, that we might proceed to visit the most famous antiquities; I endeavoured in vain to persuade him, that moderns were to me infinitely more entertaining—he insisted upon it that it was a custom every one complied with, and I was obliged, much
<PB N="185" REF="189"/>against my inclination, to spend whole mornings in viewing statues, obelisks, and triumphal arches, without number; and the more they were broken the more he expatiated on their beauties, but my sentiments on these occasions did not per∣fectly coincide with his; and the ruins of those baths (which he appeared al∣most to reverence) gave me not any other idea, than, that the ancient Ro∣mans, were a very cleanly people: the demolished amphitheatre was a proof that they had a taste for public diver∣sions, and their magnificent <HI>mausoleums,</HI> that in fondness for sepulchral pomp, they even exceeded the moderns. I contem∣plated all these with the eye of a phi∣losopher, that is to say, with the most perfect indifference, which is the light one certainly ought to see every thing which bears not the least analogy to the

He took me to all the princi∣pal palaces, many of which contain paintings and antiquities of more value than the structures themselves. I was absolutely wearied, fatigued, and tired to death with seeing all these things, and would gladly have paid double the sum
<PB N="187" REF="191"/>agreed on, to have been at rest, but must then have given up every hope of being looked upon as a man of taste and virtue, to obtain which, I daily suffered ten thousand inconveniences, one of which (and not the least) was the hor∣rid custom of rising at day-break, which lengthened the morning to as many hours as compose the day of a man of fashion, either here or in England.</P>

<PB N="190" REF="194"/>to kiss her hand: this is the whole amount of what they have a right to expect; but the services de∣manded from them are of a very different nature, the one presents his arm to <HI>la Signora</HI> when she goes abroad, calls up her servants in pub∣lick, takes care of her cloak, and sometimes carries her lap dog; the other passes the morning in her apart∣ment, assists at her toilet, presides at her <HI>conversationé,</HI> and is at all times to entertain her with his wit when she is inclined to listen to it; and this custom has been of so long a continuance that the jealous Italians are never alarmed on the account of the <HI>cicesbeo,</HI> but look upon them as the most vigilant guardians of the ”fidelity of their wives.</Q> <Q>But is it “true in fact (returned I) that your <HI>oices∣beo,</HI>

<P>"WHEN I was within one day's journey of Madrid, my provi∣sions were quite exhausted, and was dis∣tressed how to procure a supply, when I arrived at a little despicable looking house honoured with the name of an inn, and was much rejoiced to fee before the fire, spits with several sorts of game, and large stewpans, in which were sauces, soups, and ragouts, the smell of which was sufficient to create an appetite. I had no sooner alighted than I eagerly enquired what I could have for supper. <Q>“In general (said my landlord) my lord, I could furnish a table fit for
<PB N="198" REF="202"/>the Infant himself, or any other Prince of the blood, yet to-night, we cannot provide you with any thing; but to∣morrow you may have whatever you ”please.</Q> <Q>To-morrow, (replied I, ea∣gerly;) “why friend, I am almost famish∣ed at this instant, therefore bring me ”something to eat immediately.</Q> <Q>I am “very sorry it is not in my power (said he gravely) but it is an absolute fact, no∣thing of any kind can positively be had here till to-morrow; I have not any thing of my own in the house to dress for you, and even if I had, my servants are now too much engaged to prepare ”it.</Q> For whom then (said I) are all these <Q>“various dishes now dressing in your kit∣chen?”</Q> <Q>For the supper (answered “he) of Signior Don Alonzo—Cata∣plinos—Alphonsos—Aloyas de Zuga∣rate, who never travels without plen∣ty
<PB N="199" REF="203"/>of provision, yet, for all that, it is im∣possible for me to procure any part of it ”for you.</Q> Judge Marquis, how greatly I must be provoked to hear him argue thus calmly, whilst I was six leagues from any other habitation, and even if I could attain it, might not probably be better accommodated. I laid hold of the fel∣low and nearly strangled him, when (on hearing a disturbance) the noble Spa∣niard came to enquire the cause of it, and, on being made acquainted with my dis∣ress, politely invited me to partake of his supper; and finding that I was proceeding to Madrid, proposed we should the next day set out at the same time, and travel to∣gether: we did so, and during our route became so very sociable, that the Don∣made me the confident of his passion for a beautiful lady, named Cecilia, for whom he professed the most perfect adoration.
<PB N="200" REF="204"/>
<Q>“Yes, (cried he with transport) I confess to you I am the happiest of men: far from treating me with the least degree of rigour, the object of my affection deigns to receive my vows; and I have the greatest reason to be happy in her indulgence, since she grants me every thing a lover can ask. You shall this night be witness to the supreme felicity I enjoy, and accompany me to my ”charming mistress.</Q> I congratulated Zugarate on his good fortune, and assured him how sensible I was of the confidence he had reposed in me. We arrived at Ma∣drid early in the afternon, and soon after our entrance into the city, passed by a very magnificent house which he told me was the residence of his adorable Cecilia; for which reason we passed se∣veral times up and down the street, yet had not any reason to think that
<PB N="201" REF="205"/>we were observed, or this piece of ga∣lantry the least attended to by the fair one. The Spaniard, however, was perfectly sa∣tisfied with having viewed her windows, and as he had not any hope of an in∣terview till midnight, he promised to call on me at that hour, that I might accompany him to his assignation; in the mean time, he conducted me to an excellent inn, and strongly recom∣mended it to the landlord to be par∣ticularly attentive to me; and at the appointed hour, he came muffled up in a long cloak, which concealed most part of his face; under one arm he carried a very long sword, and in the other hand was a guittar; he then lapped me up in a cloak like his own, and though the night was extremely dark, and the streets very dirty, we set out on our perigrination, which was not a
<PB N="202" REF="206"/>very agreeable one, as we were soon two as dirty knight errants as can be con∣ceived; and to add to our inconveniency, were continually running against other musicians, many of whom like buttresses were standing as close as possible to the walls of different mansions: at last we came to the abode of the goddess of Signior Zu∣garate; as soon as we arrived under her window, after several profound sighs he drew out his guittar and played several tender airs, and afterwards accompanied with his voice a very lamentable sonnet, composed by himself in praise of his mis∣tress; the accompaniment was however so discordant, and the contortions of his body so very ridiculous, that I could scarce re∣frain from laughter; the clock now struck four, yet the <HI>amoroso</HI> still continued his music till I was heartily tired, and wished him at the devil very sincerely. I did every
<PB N="203" REF="207"/>thing in my power to persuade him to re∣tire, but in vain; at last the window open∣ed, and I discerned (through the lattice) the figure of a woman: Don Zugarate in∣stantly began to pour forth a thousand professions of love, and as many antedilu∣vian complements and old fashioned vows of constancy, to which no other an∣swer was made than a very abrupt en∣quiry of whom he had with him; he informed the fair inquisitive my name, that I was an Englishman, lodged at such an inn, was his intimate friend, and had that very day arrived at Ma∣drid. When he had ended this intel∣ligence, an hand whiter than snow was passed through the bars of the lattice which I concluded after this introduc∣tion, was intended for me to kiss, I therefore raised my arm respectfully to take it, but whilst my lips were fixed upon
<PB N="204" REF="208"/>it, the love-sick Spaniard, not doubting but the favour was meant for him alone, laid his hands on one of mine and kis∣sed it with the utmost rapture: we were then ordered to retire, which we obeyed, and on our return home, Don Zugarate asked me, (if I did not look upon him as the happiest of mankind?) <Q>If this (said “I) is the sum total of your felicity, it must be owned your wishes are easily ”satisfied.</Q> <Q>Heavens! (said he) is not “mine the height of human happiness? have I not passed the greatest part of this night under the window of her whom I adore? did she not con∣descend to shew herself to me through the lattice, without seeming displeased at the proofs I gave her of my passion? and have not I been permitted to kiss one of the most beautiful hands in the world? happy! superlatively

<P>"THE abrupt manner in which I had quitted Spain, certainly pre∣vented my visiting some places I intended, the theatre in particular; and the only na∣tional observation I had time to make, was, that the streets of Madrid are kept most disgustingly dirty; but still from this early adventure of mine, I had an op∣portunity of being perfectly well acquaint∣ed with the character of the Spanish ladies, and the absurd customs of their lovers, and I then determined that I would be tho∣roughly acquainted with France; and, in∣deed, you will find that I have not been a superficial observer, for, from my first entrance into it, I constantly enquired (whenever I changed horses,) what were
<PB N="217" REF="221"/>the curiosities of the town, though I could not always stop to view them. At Tou∣louse I learned, that the doors and win∣dows of the town house were of equal di∣mensions.

At Limoyes, I understood that the inhabitants are so amazingly fond of ches∣nuts, that they use them by way of sauce to all kinds of dishes. At Orleans, I en∣quired into the truth of the story of the fa∣mous Joan, and my landlord told me most people believed it to be a fact: I like∣wise observed, as I travelled along, that France abounds in a multitude of public roads, which I take to be a very great addition to the country, since straight lines, bordered with trees on each side, are certainly much more beautiful and

Some wise people say, indeed, it tends to corrupt the morals, but I say so much the better if it does; for they are now grown a mere obsolete word, and banished, thank heaven! from all polite society, and I hope, if ever I had any when I came from home, I shall contrive to leave them behind me.</P>

<P>"I Have now been in Paris six months; and as you know, Marquis, I live at a very great expence, I enjoy all the pleasures of a charming society, besides a great number of intimate friends; for though I do not go to bed till four in the morning, and rise at twelve at noon, yet I am fatigued almost to death every day by the endeavour to fulfil all the en∣gagements I have upon my hands; in short, the delicious pleasures of Paris exceed my most sanguine imagination. Your opera women are most delightful creatures; it is true, we are obliged to purchase their favours at an immense price, but I think it a very fortunate
<PB N="220" REF="224"/>circumstance that such divinities are to be purchased at any rate; and if you wish for something of an entanglement, with a little more the appearance of a sen∣timental passion, the women of rank are not unfashionably cruel, neither are assignations so dangerous here as in Spain and Italy; for French husbands are too well bred to be displeased with an ele∣gant young fellow for paying his devoirs to their wife. As to me, (since I left our little Adelaide to the hair-dresser,) I have been engaged to a Countess, for I must say, I have been pretty equally successful at both court and theatre; and to confess the truth, find little difference between the conduct of the dancer, who receives lovers from avarice, or the fine lady, who ensnares them for the gratification of her vanity."</P>

<P>THE recital of Lord Warton's ad∣ventures had dissipated the gloom which hung on the Marquis, who thank∣ed him for the entertainment they had afforded him; he then left my lord, and went to see his tragic nymph play Zara. He was charmed with the applause she received, which he considered as a con∣firmation of his taste in the choice of a mistress; for, as he had not the least real affection for her, she always either rose or sunk in his estimation according to the degree of approbation she met with from the public: enraptured with the manner in which she had represented the character, he went as soon as the play was over, behind the scenes, to tell her that he meant to bring
<PB N="222" REF="226"/>some friends to sup with her that even∣ing: not meeting with her behind the curtain, he went softly up to her dressing∣room; when he came near the door, he heard some one speaking in a low voice, but impassioned accent; he listened at∣tentively, and finding it the voice of the heroine, he concluded she was repeating to herself, and gently opened the door; but, to his surprize, was soon convinced that these tender epithets were not ad∣dressed either to an invisible or an un∣grateful lover, for he beheld the first tra∣gedian kneeling before her, whilst she was declaring an unabated passion for him, in the most explicit terms. The Marquis was not very well pleased at this discovery; but as his heart was en∣tirely free from any thing like love for this fair inconstant, he resolved to give her up with all the nonchalance which so
<PB N="223" REF="227"/>eminently distinguishes the man of fa∣shion; therefore, addressing himself to the lovers, who expected to see him on his entrance very much enraged, he said in a theatrical tone of voice, and the closest imitation of the voice and manner of the actress when on the stage:
<Q><L>"Forgive me, beauteous Princess, that</L>
<L>"I thus intrude with eye prophane</L>

<P>THE Marchioness D'Illois having supt one evening with a fashionable party, at the house of a friend, got into her carriage about four o'clock in a winter's morning, in order to return home, most exceedingly out of temper with a bad run of cards; the coachman and footman were half asleep, and the horses almost frozen with cold, having waited at least five hours in the street; she got hastily into the coach, and it had drove some paces before she per∣ceived there was a man laying on the opposite side: extremely terrified, fear rendered her both speechless and im∣moveable for a few moments, but when she was a little recovered from her first surprise, she perceived he was in a pro∣found sleep. Madame D'Illois was just

<PB N="227" REF="231"/>the footman called loudly for the watch, and the coachman whipped his horses with great speed: the motion of the carriage brought the Marchioness to life, when her conductor addressed himself to her in the gentlest accents, <Q>Be no “longer alarmed, Madam, (said he) the villains are fled, and I am happy to have had in my power to have rendered you this service, yet, cannot help being surprised to find a lady can possibly run the risque of being alone in a carriage at this hour of the night; it is not, I believe, a very general custom for women to return after midnight unattended, since they may be liable to other insults, if not as dangerous, yet full as disagreeable as that you ”have now met with.</Q></P>

<PB N="230" REF="234"/>”own.</Q> These words shocked the pro∣vincial exceedingly; he was confused and seemed to apprehend he had been guilty of a most unpardonable rudeness; he stammered a thousand incoherent ap∣pologies:—to add to his confusion, the coach soon after drove into a spacious court yard to the door of a magnificent hotel, where he saw an elegant stair case lighted in the most superb stile; he of∣fered the Marchioness his hand to conduct her to her apartment and then prepared to retire, though Madame D'Illois repea∣tedly pressed him to stay for half an hour; he pleaded that it was extremly late, that she must be discomposed by her fright and want rest, and it was with the greatest difficulty she could prevail on him to suffer her equipage to conduct him home: with evident signs of humility he request∣ed permission to enquire after her the

Her unfashio∣nable visitor was extremely surprised on being introduced into her bedcham∣ber; and not doubting but she was dan∣gerously ill with the fright she had un∣dergone, he advanced on tip toe to the bedside, and enquired after her health in a very incoherent manner; whilst the Marchioness, adorned with all the negli∣gent graces of refined coquetry, was reclined on her pillows in the most be∣coming attitude; and conscious that she looked enchantingly handsome, ordered

<P>THE Marchioness became so ex∣tremely attached to her new lover, that her whole time was entirely devoted to him; and, for the enjoyment of his society, she gave up all public diversions, all private parties, and every amusement she was once so fond of; and not content with being inseparable when in Paris, they frequently quitted the town and went for three or four days into the country, for the pleasure of being together without interruption; and so great was their ap∣parent sympathy and affection, that it seemed impossible any accident could arise, to destroy their felicity. For a whole month did they continue the friends, companions, and lovers of each other;
<PB N="239" REF="243"/>but, at the end of that period, he was obliged to go into the country on particu∣lar business relative to his law suit, and was to be detained there three long days. As his time was to be intirely devoted to business, Madame D'Illois could not ac∣company him; but she suffered so much from the idea of his leaving her, tho' for so short a time, that her sighs and tears pierced him to the heart, and he gene∣rously almost wished himself less beloved, rather than see her suffer so much from her extreme fondness and exquisite sensi∣bility; at length he tore himself from her embraces, after repeating a thousand vows of constancy, and making the most solemn promise to accelerare his return by every means in his power.</P>

<P>TRUE to his word, and agreeable to his inclination, at the expiration of the three days, he returned to Paris, and was set down at the door of the Mar∣chioness, having pictured to himself for the last ten leagues, the joy with which he should be received and the delight she would express at his punctuality; but to his surprise, Madame D'Illois did not rise from her seat on his apperance, and treated him with such coldness that she scarce deigned to look upon him; and after having asked him a few questions relative to his journey, which she told him (she thought had been extremely expeditious), she complained of a very violent head
<PB N="241" REF="245"/>ach; and, finding that hint did not succeed according to her wishes, by obliging him to retire, but that on the contrary he ex∣pressed his sorrow for her indisposition, and wished to stay to entertain her, she repulsed his caresses with disdain, quar∣relled with him violently for treating her with so little respect; and absolutely for∣bid him for the future to continue his visits. The poor provincial shocked to the last degree, at the alteration in her behaviour, retired in disorder, and as he had really a very sincere passion for the Marchioness, could scarcely restrain his tears; yet, as he could not comprehend the cause of this behaviour, he flattered himself that it was the mere caprice of a fine woman, and that love would soon seal his pardon for a fault which had been in∣voluntary, and vainly hoped that this little altercation would sweeten their reconcilia∣tion.
<PB N="242" REF="246"/>Thus erroneously did he judge of a fashionable female heart, as if suceptible of the same sensations which are the result of artless truth and amiable sincerity in the bosom of innocence and modesty. Deluded by the hope of finding those virtues in Madame D'Illois, with which she was wholly unacquainted, he ventur∣ed the next day to call at her door, but she was not at home; and having repeated his visits till the fourth day, he was then told, <Q>That it would be entirely needless “to give himself any further trouble, as it was her positive orders that he ”should never more be admitted.</Q> Finding he could not obtain the favour of a private audience, he then endeavoured to see her at a third place, not doubting but the sight of a man whom she had so ten∣derly loved, would once more awaken her affection, and restore him to happiness.
<PB N="243" REF="247"/>He was so fortunate at last as to meet her at the house of a friend (to whom she had introduced him), and where the company was so numerous that they might hold a conversation unobserv∣ed: he trembled when she entered, but at last took courage to address himself to her with the energy of a lover and the familiarity of an old acquaintance. The Marchioness listened to him with the most chilling civility, returned him several low courtesies as answers to his professions of love, and despair, and observed all the distant politeness due to a stranger, which so entirely disconcerted him that she easily disengaged herself from him, which she had no sooner done, than she asked in a loud whisper so as to be overheard by him, <Q>“Who that stupid animal could possibly be, who made so many protestations of love and admiration to a woman to
<PB N="244" REF="248"/>whom he could owe nothing but res∣spect!”</Q> This speech, and the contemp∣tuous air which accompanied it, so affect∣ed her lover that he was at once a prey to the most violent contending passions; and unable any longer to conceal his emotions, he retired hastily, and instantly got into his chaise to return to his rural habitation.</P>

<P>TO explain the enigma which had so puzzled the poor provincial, we shall take a retrospect of the conduct of the Marchioness during the three days ab∣sence of her lover, which had thus entirely exiled him from her good graces: on on the first, she remained inconsolable, could neither eat or sleep, and her whole employment was in writing the greatest part of a long letter to him, which she resolved to send after him by an express the next day; but it was absolutely impos∣sible for her to fulfil her intention, for the very next morning her millener brought her home a cap, so elegantly ornamented with feathers, and so exceedingly be∣coming, that she could not resist the de∣sire she had to appear in it that evening at the opera. In the box exactly opposite
<PB N="246" REF="250"/>to her own (which was that of the Du∣chess De—) sat a very elegant hand∣some young man, whose eyes were fixed on Madame D'Illois from the moment she entered, in spite of all the endeavours of the Duchess to fix his attention on herself. Proud of such a conquest, and so evident a triumph over the Duchess, (who had long been her rival in beauty,) the Marchioness determined to pursue her victory, and having had an invita∣tion to sup with the Duchess, which she had refused, (whilst determined to seclude herself during the absence of her lover) she now resolved to accept it, in hopes of meeting the handsome stranger: the Duchess, on the contrary, was ex∣tremely mortified when she saw her enter, adorned with every grace art and nature could bestow. Madame D'Illois made her apologies for the intrusion with infi∣nite
<PB N="247" REF="251"/>wit and vivacity, and her new ad∣mirer was introduced to her by the name of the Duke de Wilcan, a German of high distinction; they sat next each other at supper, soon became perfectly ac∣quainted—he afterwards conducted her home—attended her toilette the following morning—and so charmed the inconstant Marchioness that she looked back with surprise on her love for the provincial— was quite ashamed of having been guilty of such a depravation of taste, and of having devoted so much of her time to a being quite unknown in the <HI>beau monde;</HI> even blushed at the recollection of her past folly—burnt the letter she had nearly finished—and formed a resolution to re∣ceive him in the manner already related.</P>

<P>THE Marquis D'Illois having been deceived by two of his mistresses, lavished all his fondness on the only one which remained; and being determined, if possible, to engage her gratitude, and even make it her interest to prove true to him, he made her the most magnifi∣cent presents, the particulars of which it would be tedious to enumerate; but amongst a variety of others, were a purse, with brilliant sliders, and a pair of very fine shoe buckles, the first of which he had the mortification to see in less than a fortnight in the hands of a professed gamester at a public gaming table; and the latter, a few days after, worn by the Harlequin in the Italian comedy. Most sincerely mortified by the preference given to such unworthy rivals, he instantly dis∣carded

<P>"THE delicate beauty, who had thus engaged the transitory affections of Monsieur D'Illois, was the daughter of a cobler, whose honesty and jocularity made him known in the neighbourhood by the name of father Lucas.

The cobler, who though in a low station of life, had more under∣standing

The poor girl in consequence of this ill treat∣ment, became more willing than ever to listen to the tender declarations of her lovers; and the gentleness and affection with which she was treated abroad, served to render home more disagreeable, and made her look upon her father as the most hateful of men, and the worst of tyrants.</P>

The joy of such an acquisition gave her new life and vivacity, and rendered her every day more charming; and this palate, which it was impossible to discern without looking into her mouth, rendered Julia some time after more celebrated than her personable charms, and occasioned some of the most remarkable revolutions in her life.</P>

<P>"MOnsieur Champagne now took upon him the character of a man of fashion and family, who with his wife had been obliged to quit France sudden∣ly on an affair of honour, and who sought an asylum in England till the event of the wound of his antagonist was known: they took a lodging at the house of a widow, who being of a soci∣able disposition, and charmed with the modest deportment of the pretended Madame Champagne, introduced them to her acquaintance, and chearfully ac∣companied them to all places of public amusement. Champagne soon became weary of his mistress, but as he left her
<PB N="264" REF="268"/>entirely at liberty to form her own en∣gagements, and go out as often as she pleased, she thought her life a very agreeable one, and was perfectly happy. One day a young friend sent to Julia, to desire her to go the next day, on a party into the country; but as they did not wish the landlady to make one of the company, it was to be a secret, and Mon∣sieur Champagne, having (as he had ge∣nerally done for some time) declined go∣ing with his wife, Julia went out by herself, to the house of the lady, very early in the morning, and from thence to Richmond, where having passed an agreeable day, they returned to town by water, and it being a fine moon light night, did not get to London till mid∣night. When Julia entered the house, the servant who opened the door express∣ed herself greatly surprised at her return,
<PB N="265" REF="269"/>and on calling down her mistress, Julia was astonished to find she was come back very unexpectedly: <Q>For how is it pos∣sible “(said the landlady) I should ever think of seeing you any more, when your husband this very morning paid me all that was due, took your property away with him, and told me that he was obliged to go back suddenly to France, and was to overtake you at Dover, for which place you had set out in the morning; and the reason you had not taken leave of me, was his having enjoined you to secresy for ve∣ry ”particular reasons.</Q> Thunderstruck by this information, Julia was some time before she could recover her spirits suffi∣ciently to go into her former apartments, and when she did, found it divested of all her wardrobe, and that he had not left her even a second change of linen:
<PB N="266" REF="270"/>shocked at being thus reduced at once to poverty and wretchedness, by the baseness of her lover, she was for several hours nearly deprived of her reason; and when she came to her senses; reflection served but to redouble her sorrows, and she passed the whole night in tears and un∣availing lamentations.</P>

<P>"THE next morning she had the mortification to find that the friendship of her landlady was grown ex∣tremely cool; and in two or three days af∣ter, she took an opportunity to inform her, that she must remove the very next morn∣ing, as she had let the apartment: thus poor Julia, after turning every thing she could possibly spare, into cash, for present subsistance, was forced to quit her lodgings for a miserable room, in an obscure court; and live with the greatest oeconomy, lest she should be reduced to die with hunger. She went daily to enquire after Cham∣pagne, at every house she knew he had frequented, hoping he might be still in
<PB N="268" REF="272"/>England; and vainly flattering herself that, though he might have wished to deceive his landlady, and change his lodgings, yet he would still seek her out, and not leave her to perish miserably for want, in a strange country. Day af∣ter day thus passed on, till at length she was compelled to believe, that he had indeed forsaken her like a villain; and she began to feel the terrifying approaches of famine, not having eat any thing, but one halfpenny roll for two days; when a man, who lived in the next garret (and who followed the laudable occupation of a pickpocket) seeing her meagre appear∣ance, offered her part of his dinner, which she joyfully accepted; and before the repast was at an end, they grew so well acquainted by the assistance of bad French and broken English, in which Julia could now make herself tolerably
<PB N="269" REF="273"/>understood, that he invited her to share half his room and the precarious liveli∣hood he obtained: thus reduced to the utmost misery, and almost starving, she did not hesitate a moment, but consented to become his future companion; and removed herself (which was all she had to convey) that very evening into his wretched habitation.</P>

He returned in less than half an hour, and took such an extraordinary fancy to Julia, that he not only generously offered to pay for as much as she could drink, but told his friend, that if he would sell her, he would give him half a crown. The pickpocket at first made some difficulty

One evening she had drank with them till she was nearly in∣toxicated, and singing as loud as she possibly could, in the midst of the song, she opened her mouth so extremely wide, that the porter for the first time discovered the silver palate, and instantly conclud∣ing some of the company had given her a shilling, which she thus meant to secret from him, he laid hold on her shoulder with one hand, and putting the other into her mouth, <Q>Ah, ah! (said he) you “vile woman, you hide your money ”from me; do you?</Q> He then laid hold of the palate with his finger and thumb, and took it by violence out of her mouth. Poor Julia in vain endeavoured to vindicate herself, for having now been so long accustomed to this assistance, she could not articulate a syllable without it, but cried out in the most frightful

I ran for an hour or more, terrified at the least noise, and trembling at the sight of every one I met; at last, I took shelter in the court yard of a magnificent hotel, where I no sooner got in, than I was surrounded by the inferior servants, who, from the singularity of my dress mistook
<PB N="312" REF="316"/>me for a madman: happily for me, the master of the house hearing a great noise, enquired into the cause of it, and ordered me to be brought before him; when I beheld him, the benovelence of his aspect and mildness of his interrogatories inspir∣ed me with confidence, I therefore threw myself at his feet, and told him the truth of my story—he was moved by my dis∣tressed situation, and on my sincere for∣row for the past, and promise of better behaviour in future, he clothed me, and kept mea week in his house, and from thence sent me to school to learn latin, and assured me at the same time, that if I continued to behave well, he would provide for me in the church.

<P>"IN a year's time I was able to express myself in latin like a little Cicero, and my protector had every reason to be pleased with my behaviour in regard to him; but, being of an artful, mischievous disposi∣tion, my fellow students sometimes suffered from the tricks I played them; even the masters under whose tuition I was placed, were not exempt entirely from its effects: (for instance) it is in some parishes a rule, at the end of lent to go from house to house to make a collection for the lent preacher—I therefore hired a proper habit and surplice, and went round to every door, soliciting the charity of well dispos∣ed
<PB N="314" REF="318"/>christians, in behalf of their pastor; and as rhetoric was my talent, I persuaded most of them to give something, and by this means made a very ample collection, which supplied my extravagancies a long time.

<P>"TIME, however, brought his in∣nocence to light, when some very wise and religious persons who were extremely vexed to have been thus sacrilegiously (as they termed it) cheated out of their donations, could not but suspect that the first collector was a cheat, and began to talk loudly of their suspi∣cious, till at last it came to the ears of the person from whom I borrowed my dress, and who was so enraged against me for having thus drawn him in as an ac∣complice in my guilt, and so afraid of being suspected of sharing in the advantage of of my crime, that he related the fact to
<PB N="316" REF="320"/>all who would listen to it, and I was soon discovered, and expected to be re∣warded for my ingenuity in the most am∣ple, if not the most agreeable manner.— Assured of the dangerous predicament in which I stood, and it not being in my power to fly, (since the money thus ac∣quired had been spent soon after it was obtained,) I one morning threw myself at the feet of my benefactor, and declar∣ed in the most pathetic terms, that, <Q>I “was so extremely shocked at the errors of my youth, and the numberless crimes I had committed, that, in order to expiate my sins, I had come to a resolution to quit the world, and to ”retire into the monastery of La Trappe.</Q> My patron had the goodness to credit my hypocritical vows of repentance and a∣mendment, but did not dare to oppose a determination which he looked upon as
<PB N="317" REF="321"/>an inspiration from heaven, and there∣fore shed tears of joy over the future saint, (not without a selfish hope, perhaps, that some of my works of superogation might mitigate a few of his own offences, from the consideration, that it was his charita∣ble assistance had thus brought me into the way of piety and truth). He gave me his blessing very devoutly at my de∣parture; and what was still more benefi∣cial to a traveller, a purse with a few louis to bear the expences of my journey to my retreat; and I then set out, not to La Trappe indeed, but to a place much more consonant to my ideas, which was to an Inn at Nanterre, where I took half a dozen companions with me, and there lived very merrily till all our money was exhausted.</P>

<P>"MY purse was no sooner empty than we were obliged from necessity to return to Paris, and on my way thither I composed a long story, sufficient to inspire my benevolent pro∣tector with compassion of <Q>my having “been robbed in my way to La Trappe, and the dreadful miseries I had en∣dured ”on my way back to Paris</Q>; but my studied eloquence was vain, and all the pains I had taken to give it an air of probability, thrown away, as I found his door absolutely shut against me, and a message left with the porter <Q>“not to be seen there any more, if I ”valued my personal safety.</Q> From this I was convinced that he was well
<PB N="319" REF="323"/>informed of the truth of my expedition, and did not dare to make any further application. Thus deprived of my only friend, without the least resource, I thought it high time to consider how I should find means to preserve my mise∣rable existence; and being both tall and strong for my age, I resolved to enlist into the army, and soon after became a soldier in a regiment then in garrison at Rochelle, where I arrived safely in company with the rest of the recruits: here I formed an intimacy with a young man, who shared my bed, and who did me a thousand little services, which I endeavoured to return on my part by all the means in my power, and we soon became inseparable companions. Two or three months after we came to Rochelle, my friend received an hun∣dred louis from his father, (nearly all
<PB N="320" REF="324"/>he was worth in the world, and what he could very ill spare,) in order to purchase his discharge. Our colonel being absent, and the young soldier much afraid of losing a sum of this consequence, requested me to keep it for him a few days, as he had not a trunk that would lock. Almost as soon as he had entrusted it to me, I formed a plan to keep possession of it; in pursuance of this I slipt out unperceived, and buried the money in a very private place amidst some bushes, which I took care to mark in such a manner that I could infallibly know it again, and then returned to my companions, who, far from suspecting the matter, asked me to go and drink, which I gladly complied with: we drank a good deal, and though I was in fact perfectly sober, pretended to be the soonest intoxicated,
<PB N="321" REF="325"/>and they being nearly more than half drunk, we none of us returned to quar∣ters, but lay down on a bench which was in the room. When we had lain and slept several hours, I no sooner awoke than I put my hand into my pocket, and declared to my astonished comrade (with a look of inconceivable horror, and all the gestures of a mad∣man) <Q>that I had lost the hundred “”louis whilst I slept.</Q> I pretended to look every where about the room, but when all search was declared to be vain, I appeared to become almost fran∣tic with despair, and at last cried out, "Thieves," as loud as I could, whilst the oaths and threats of the young sol∣dier augmented the noise to such a de∣gree, that several of our officers ran into the room to enquire what was the mat∣ter, and hearing the whole story began
<PB N="322" REF="326"/>to examine me very accurately, and finding me prevaricate in my evi∣dence, suspected a cheat, and instantly sent me to the dungeon—I was tried by a court-martial the next day, and though I still persisted in my declarations of innocence to the last, yet appearances were so strong against me, that I was deemed unworthy any longer to serve the king, and sentenced to first run the gauntlet, and afterwards to be drummed out of the regiment, and never more allowed to carry arms: the latter part of the sentence in my opinion fully compensated for the former, as I by this means procured my discarge without paying for it.</P>

<P>"AFTER this ceremony was over, and I had been hissed out, I hid myself near the town till night, and then, though my shoulders were very sore, made a shift to get to the place where the louis were concealed, and as soon as I had them in my possession, thought myself, in spite of my disgrace, a very fortunate fellow, and set out imme∣diately for a very distant province, where I took a lodging, made a few acquaint∣ances, and behaved so well to those, that I was soon well received in several cre∣ditable families, and insinuated myself so much into their esteem, that they introduced me to the governor, who believing me to be really a gentleman
<PB N="324" REF="328"/>of fortune, permitted me to purchase a lieutenancy, which I paid for with the best part of the hundred louis, and thought it well bestowed, since I had not any objection to the military life as an officer, though I abhorred that of a common soldier. I now entered deeply into the science of play, and acquired a method of cutting, dealing, and shuffling the cards, which if not much to my honour, was at least greatly to my advantage, by which means I was so successful that I dressed with taste, gave elegant entertainments, and lived very expensively for some time: but unfortunately for me, a deserter was one day taken by my company, who had deserted from that corps a twelvemonth before, and had inlisted into that which I had lately left so dishonourably at Rochelle. When this man was tried, I
<PB N="325" REF="329"/>was on the court-martial, and appointed after his conviction to read to him the sentence of death; I had not the smallest recollection of his person, but unluckily for me, his memory was not so erroneous, for he fixed his eyes on me stedfastly, and with a deep sigh, <Q>I have, gentle∣men, “(said he, addressing himself to the court) deserved the death I am doomed to suffer, and committed many actions which I sincerely repent, but most particularly do I accuse my∣self of having shewn mercy to the shoulders of that wretch, (pointing to me) when he ran the gauntlet through the regiment now at Rochelle, for having stolen an hundred louis from ”his comrade.</Q></P>

<P>"I Went directly to Paris, and when arrived there had still the assu∣rance to wear my uniform, on pretence of being an officer, whose curiosity had brought him to the metropolis; this fable met with universal belief, or at least no one gave themselves the trouble to contradict it, which answered my pur∣pose just as well; and as I pursued all manner of pleasure without the least reserve, I was again reduced to the ut∣most distress; for here my adroit ma∣nagement of the cards would no longer be of service to me, since there were at Paris many persons who understood that science much better than myself. I was soon forced to have recourse to
<PB N="328" REF="332"/>the meanest and most despicable arti∣fices to obtain a precarious livelihood. One evening at the French comedy, I stood in the parterre, next to an honest, plain-looking man, who frequently drew from his pocket a most tempting gold snuff box, on which I cast a longing eye every time he exhibited this piece of finery, which by no means corresponded with the other parts of his dress: when the performance was nearly over, and every one attentive to the catastrophe, I ventured to slip it (as I thought un∣perceived) out of his pocket into mine, but fate so ordained that he missed it almost the very moment after, and very justly suspected his next neighbour; but unwilling to cause confusion in the house, and, perhaps, not wishing me to under∣go the punishment I so richly deserved, he took me by the arm, and said to me
<PB N="329" REF="333"/>in a whisper, <Q>My friend, you have “taken my snuff-box out of my pocket —return it to me instantly, or I will immediately deliver you up to the ”guard.</Q> It was in vain for me to pretend to any evasion, since he would doubtless have searched my pockets di∣rectly; I therefore stood pale and trem∣bling, but at length assuming some de∣gree of courage from the humanity ap∣parent in his countenance: <Q>It is too “true, sir, (said I) with shame I ac∣knowledge my crime, but as it is the first I have been guilty of, do not, I beseech you, expose an unhappy young man, but content yourself with drawing it privately from my pocket, and I will stand in such a manner as to give you an oppotunity to ”take it unperceived.</Q> The poor, foolish fellow swallowed the bait, and
<PB N="330" REF="334"/>agreed to this proposition, but no sooner did I feel his hand entirely in my pocket, than I laid hold of it, and called out for the guard with the greatest vocife∣ration; in vain did he relate the truth of the fact, and loudly protest his inno∣cence, many persons had seen his hand, whilst I by force held it in my pocket; he therefore met with neither pity or belief from the spectators, and he was by them consigned to the custody of the guard, and most probably taken to a dungeon, whilst I, during the confu∣sion, made off with my booty, which I instantly sold for a considerable sum, and went that very night through the province of Languedoc for Montpellier.</P>

I first gained his confidence by writing sentimental <HI>billet∣doux</HI> to a lady with whom he was ho∣hourably in love; and by being service∣able to him in some other amours, which were pretty numerous, and not quite so sentimental, in short, so far ingratiated myself into his esteem, that he made me his clerk, and appointed me receiver under him; when finding me very dili∣gent
<PB N="332" REF="336"/>and attentive to business (of which he was very careless and dilatory), pleased with having an assistant who saved him so much trouble, he put the matter en∣tirely into my hands, and intrusted me with the whole receipt of the cash, the consequence of which was, that as soon as I had accumulated sums to as large an amount as ever could be in my hands at one time, my patron being gone on a pleasurable jaunt for six weeks, and quite secure of not being missed for some days, I set off early one fine morning with all the money in my possession.</P>

My success vere∣fied
<PB N="338" REF="342"/>my idea, and I was soon after intro∣duced to a person high in the church, as a rich young Abbé, who wished prefer∣ment, more for the name of the thing than pecuniary motives; for which rea∣son I was soon made a canon with twelve hundred livres a year, without taking priest's orders, but was to reside at one of the principal towns in Burgundy.

<PB N="352" REF="356"/>had set out with acknowledging himself to be a rogue, and that the continuation of his history had proved him such a consumate deceiver, that not any credit ought to have been given to his protesta∣tions; he hastened, therefore, to the ho∣tel of Madame D'Illois so very angry that, as he neither knew the name of the thief, or his estate, which he had care∣fully avoided the mention of (during the whole of his narration) he determined to give an accurate description of his person, and a large reward for appre∣hending him; but finding, when he ar∣rived at the Marchioness's hotel, that she was gone to the masquerade, he threw over him a black domino, and hastened after her, without thinking any more of his watch and purse, or the arch de∣ceiver who had cheated him of both.</P>

<P>IN the mean time Monfieur D'Illois continued to support his favourite Julia at a considerable expence; he be∣stowed on her jewels fit for a duchess, and her liveries, coach, and hotel, were infinitely superior to those which had been given her by the financier. But the Marquis, unfortunately not having any share in the finance, his fortune could not afford him this variety of luxury and extravagance, without being greatly deranged, and at some times even distressed for money to pursue his amuse∣ments: nevertheless, he continued the pursuit of pleasure with the same eager∣ness, although, to gratify it, his steward sold farms, mortgaged estates, and bought annuities daily for the purpose of supplying him with cash; and it would have been impossible for him to
<PB N="354" REF="358"/>have gained longer credit had he not been a man of distinction. Proud of having the name of a person of quality in their books, they charged their own price, and waited with tolerable patience the payment of their bills: it is true, that his anti-chamber was generally full of creditors every morning, but a bow to one—a smile to the second—and an en∣quiry after the family of the third, were such a charm to plebeians, that it fre∣quently hushed the intended demand, and often obliged them to retire without ut∣tering a syllable to so polite and well-bred a debtor; although the same trades∣men, had the debt been due from one of their own rank, would have been deaf to the tears and intreaties of a wife and helpless family, and perhaps have refused to wait till honest industry could have accumulated the sum that was to satisfy their impatience.</P>

<P>THE Marchioness D'Illois was at this time as strongly attached to her German lover, Duke de Wilcan, as she had a short time before been to the Provincial; and it was more likely to be a lasting passion, since they mixed in every fashionable amusement, joined in every scene of dissipation, and were never long enough alone to become tired of each other. The Duke was particularly fond of play, and the Marchioness at first pursued it in compliance to his inclina∣tion, but at last it became so habitual that she was unable to live without it, and spent whole days, and even nights, at whist and pharoan, with all the anxiety of a professed gamester, which occasion∣ed so entire a change both in her person and disposition, that she became almost

<P>FOrtune was, however, so very un∣kind to Madame D'Illois, that the next evening she lost the whole sum she had so dearly purchased of the jew; and her jewels (as she had not the least proba∣bility of paying the money at the expi∣ration of the time) must of course be∣come the property of the ill-favoured descendant of Abraham and Moses. It might be supposed that the idea of part∣ing, with her jewels, would have been sufficient to have reduced to despair a woman animated by the spirit of co∣quetry, and fond of dress to the most extravagant degree; but her passion for
<PB N="362" REF="366"/>play had so absorbed every other, that she bore her loss with the temper of a philosopher, and seemed only to regret that it was no longer in her power to ap∣pear at the card table, which was abso∣lutely impossible till she had replenished her purse: and to whom could she ap∣ply for this purpose?—not to her hus∣band, for she was certain she should be refused—and as to her lover, Duke de Wilcan, he had been the partner in her misfortune, and was to the full as much distressed as herself. At last on a hint from Mademoiselle, her <HI>suivante,</HI> (who was her confidante, and had a lucrative view in the advice she gave her lady) she was prevailed upon to make application to a financier, whose name was Mondor, a man of immense wealth, and who had shewn his designs on her so evidently soon after she was married, (that being
<PB N="363" REF="367"/>then, at least more delicate, if not more prudent) his frightful person, and more disagreeable behaviour, made her treat him with such evident marks of contempt, that he forbore his visits; how∣ever, she now condescended to see him immediately, and repented that she had not taken this method before her appli∣cation to the jew, as she was certain every compliance with the wishes of the financier would be rewarded with the most unbounded liberality.</P>

Soon after that event, Madame Morambert came to Paris, and set up a millener's shop, in which the daughter assisted; but the mother dying soon after, the poor girl became chamber maid to the Marchioness, and observing the <HI>penchant</HI> of the Baron, played off all her artillery against him, who was so de∣lighted with the modesty of her appea∣rance and the insinuating humility of her behaviour, and above all, the unbounded affection she with blushes acknowledged he had inspired her with, that he obliged her to quit the service of his daughter and retire to a lodging he had provided, where he determined by every means in his power to subdue the stubborn virtue he believed she possessed—but failing in every attempt—and finding the fair one deaf to all his ardent professions, and that
<PB N="397" REF="401"/>she was so enraged at his offer of a large settlement, that she resolved to retire to a convent to avoid him—he was so fully convinced of the severity of her virtue, that in spight of ther generous represen∣tations, <Q><HI>how greatly he degraded himself “”by such an alliance,</HI></Q> he one evening obliged her to accept a contract of marriage.</P>

<P>IN order to begain with propriety the plan of devotion, adopted by the Marchioness D'Illois, it became necessa∣ry to make great alteration both in her dress and manner of life; but very un∣fortunately for her father confessor, who would undoubtly have rejoiced greatly over a saint of his own making, the black dress of a devotee set off the charms of the Marchioness extremely and shewed the delicacy of her complection to advantage—the long sleeve gave an additional grace to the beauty of her hand—whilst the close cap seemed to be worn to keep those tresses within proper bounds, which were too luxuriant to be
<PB N="399" REF="403"/>confined by art; and the neat, plain, ele∣gant satin slipper, as if to indicate that so pretty a foot could please without orna∣ment. Add to this, that early hours had in great part restored her beauty—and reco∣vered her <HI>en-bon-point;</HI> and it will then be easily conceived that she was become even more attractive than before, and as much a coquette as ever</P>

<P>THE sudden conversion of the Mar∣chioness soon became the universal topic of conversation in all polite circles— the women ridiculed her dress—the men defended it, <HI>because it became her</HI>—the ladies thought her perfectly right to re∣nounce her lovers, <HI>because they were now in hopes to engage their attention</HI>—the men, on the contrary, declared her exceed∣ingly wrong, <HI>as they thought her too beautiful to wish her virtuous;</HI> and whilst every man of taste made it a point to pervert the lovely devotee, many even of her old lovers found in her change of conduct all the charms of novelty, and returned to her with eagerness; amongst these were the volatile viscount
<PB N="401" REF="405"/>De l'Encluse. The provincial gentleman, (whose law-suit being decided in his fa∣vour, was returned to live in Paris, so much improved by an acquaintance with the world, that he could now carry on an intrigue with all the appearance of passion, without either <HI>affection</HI> or <HI>esteem,</HI> and break off with the same <HI>sang froid</HI> which had before so much surprised him.) The Marchioness and he had renewed their ac∣quaintance, and she was once more on good terms with him, with the financier Mondor, and the constant Duke de Wil∣can likewise—these were all favoured by turns, with so much mystery, that— each believed himself the <HI>only hapyy man;</HI> whilst her days being devoted to exercises of devotion, and she wore such an ap∣pearance of virtue in her deportment, that the tongue of malice and envy, did not dare to pronounce her an hypocrite.</P>

<P>THAT day proved to be a day of events to Madame D'Illois, for the Baron could not have proceeded many miles on his journey before an express came from the army, which brought to the Marchioness the melancholy news of the death of the Marquis D'Illois, who had been killed in a duel by a general officer two days before.</P>

<P>THE letter which brought this ac∣count, contained not any other par∣ticulars; but the reader's curiosity may probably lead him to enquire, what could possibly have been cause sufficient to in∣duce that man to draw a sword, who had so often submitted to bear the highest indignity that can be offered to an husband, without an attempt to re∣venge the insult? Soon after the Marquis arrived at the army, he formed an ac∣quaintance with a general officer, and they became in a very short time the most intimate friends; however, Mons. D'Illois (knowing that he was a man of universal gallantry, and that Julia's fidelity was not to be greatly relied on) kept with
<PB N="412" REF="416"/>unaccustomed prudence, both his mis∣tress and her abode from his knowledge; but the general had a servant, whose only merit was such kind of discove∣ries, and this man not only found out the whole secret, but carried several letters, and contrived matters so well, that Julia received several visits from his master without the least suspicion.</P>

The general stood by a calm spectator of his rage, but the Mar∣quis in rushing by him out at the door, unfortunately trod upon his toe—pro∣voked at the indignity, he demanded in∣stant satisfaction—D'Illois disdained to make any concession—caught up his sword which hung in the room—and they went out together immediately.</P>

<P>THE Marchioness was at first really shocked at the unexpected death of Monsieur D'Illois—had him buried with the greatest magnificence—after which ce∣remony, his creditors seized all they could for payment, while his widow consoled herself with a large jointure, and declared she <Q>should not pay any debts he had con∣tracted.“”</Q> Scarce had she received com∣pliments of condolance, before she one evening received a note from her lover, (the Duke de Wilcan) in which he con∣jured her to <Q>wave the delicacy of her “present situation, and to devote some hours to love and his society, and
