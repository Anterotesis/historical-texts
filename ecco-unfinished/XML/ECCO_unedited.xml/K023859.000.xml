<HEAD>To His ROYAL HINGHNESS GEORGE, Prince of WALES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have assum'd the liberty of dedicating the following Poem to the HEIR-APPARENT of the BRITISH Crown, without his knowledge or permission. In extenuation of such freedom, I hope I may be allow'd to plead a long and invariable At∣tachment to the ILLUSTRIOUS House of HANOVER.</P>
<P>As I have never been us'd to pace in the trammels of Flattery, I shall not even attempt a Display of that LIBERAL turn of mind, which cha∣racterizes the PRINCE of WALES, lest
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>Truth should have the appearance of Flattery.</P>
<P>After this declaration I must be totally silent on the many accom∣plishments, which adorn the PRINCE and the MAN.</P>
<P>When Heaven shall summon your ILLUSTRIOUS FATHER to enjoy the reward of his public and private Vir∣tues, and the SUBJECT is raised to the SOVEREIGN, I sincerely wish that your royal Highness may, during your WHOLE reign, justly acquire the NOBLEST of all earthly titles, that of a PATRIOT-KING.</P>
<PB N="vii" REF="5"/>
<P>If a Perusal of the following Poem should luckily afford your ROYAL HIGHNESS the least pleasure or enter∣tainment, I shall think myself amply rewarded for the time I have spent in its composition.</P>
<P>I beg leave to have the honour of subscribing myself,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>ILLUSTRIOUS SIR, Your ROYAL HIGHNESSES fellow-subject, and most obedient humble Servant, The AUTHOR.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<L>We're not in such sad situation.</L>
<L>Our Reason we may exercise</L>

<L>Saint PETER in his easy chair</L>
<L>Sits dozing: to his Lodge repair</L>
<L>Souls made immortal: He inspects</L>
<L>Their Passports: asks their several Sects;</L>
<L>And, after some confabulation,</L>
<L>Shows each where lies his heavenly station.</L>

</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<LG>
<L>Some Spirits, (by Death's Act of Grace</L>
<L>Happily freed from corp'ral case)</L>
<L>To whom due Passports had been given,</L>
<L>Join'd on the Road that leads to Heaven.</L>
<L>After some complimental Greeting</L>
<L>Upon th' occasion of their meeting,</L>

<L>The fell into familiar chat</L>
<L>On various Subjects, this and that:</L>
<L>What they had seen and known on Earth,</L>
<L>From <HI>Cradle</HI> to their <HI>second</HI> Birth.</L>
<L>Pleas'd and quite happy in each other,</L>
<L>'Twas every word, dear friend, or brother.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not long this social converse lasted,</L>
<L>Till squabbles on Religion blast it.</L>
<L>Happening to touch that jarring string,</L>
<L>Their new-made fellowship takes wing.</L>
<L>They argued, wrangled, and contended;</L>
<L>While stiffly each his Sect defended.</L>
<L>At last among the Group arose</L>
<L>Zeal's <HI>Ratio ultima,</HI> dry blows:</L>
<L>But Ghosts, whate'er their wish or will,</L>
<L>Can neither bruise, draw blood, nor kill.</L>
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
<L>Tho' they from morn to night with Sabre</L>
<L>Or Fist each other shall belabour,</L>
<L>The long-contested Combat closes</L>
<L><HI>Sans</HI> wounds, black eyes, or bloody noses.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These Bigots were all fire and flame</L>
<L>Till to Saint PETER's Lodge they came.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This holy <HI>Swiss,</HI> in such renown</L>
<L>For <HI>golden Key,</HI> and <HI>triple Crown,</HI></L>
<L>Morn, noon, and night sits at Heaven's portal</L>
<L>To let in Souls, when made immortal.</L>
<L>He heard them beating rap, rap, rap;</L>
<L>With noise less loud than thunder-clap,</L>
<L>Or <HI>John</HI>'s, when he on <HI>knocker</HI> plays</L>
<L>A <HI>Solo</HI> to announce her <HI>Grace;,</HI></L>
<L>Yet loud enough, so many rapping,</L>
<L>To keep the drowsy Saint from napping.</L>

<PB N="9" REF="14"/>
<LG>
<L>The heavenly Porter cries, Who's there</L>
<L>That knocks with such a lordly air?</L>

<LG>
<L>An Israelitish Spirit answers,</L>
<L>We come to join in bliss our Grandsires:</L>
<L>I therefore beg you'll ope the wicket,</L>
<L>And give admittance—here's my ticket.</L>
</LG>
<P>He opes the door with, Who are You?</P>
<LG>
<L>The Spirit of a zealous <HI>Jew,</HI></L>
<L>Who hopes to find your favor greater</L>
<L>Upon account of SIMON PETER,</L>
<L>Your honour's brother I suppose?</L>

<P>Well what of him?</P>
<P>As story goes,</P>

<P>Prithee explain thyself, or sheer off.</P>
<LG>
<L>Then in few words he slic'd an ear off.</L>
<L>'Twas when your <HI>Master</HI> was betray'd</L>
<L>By <HI>Judas,</HI> and to trial led.</L>
<L>You may remember, when they'd tried him,</L>
<L>With imprecations you denied him;</L>
<L>For which your conscience a smart shock</L>
<L>Felt at the <HI>crowing</HI> of a cock.</L>
</LG>
<PB N="11" REF="16"/>
<LG>
<L>His Saintship blush'd as red as scarlet</L>
<L>To be thus nonpluss'd by a Varlet.</L>
<L>He had not such a choak-pear met</L>
<L>Since he was station'd at the Gate.</L>
<L>After some pause, Your road, he cries,</L>
<L>To ABRAHAM's district that way lies.</L>
<L>To each Religion, every Sect</L>
<L>A sep'rate bound'ry we select;</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>An't please your Worship, cries the Shade,</L>
<L>In <HI>Romish</HI> tenets I was bred.</L>

<L>You shall hear it.</L>
<L>I'm a <HI>Mahometan,</HI> a stanch one,</L>

<L>Variety of <HI>Nymphs</HI> divine,</L>
<L>And plenty of delicious <HI>Wine.</HI></L>

<LG>
<L>Your Prophet, Friend, was a complete</L>
<L>Enthusiast, and no doubt a Cheat.</L>
<L>How can your Sect think his Religion</L>
<L>From Heaven was brought him by a <HI>Pigeon?</HI></L>
<L>His bill of fare of bliss eternal</L>

<L>But enter, Sir, and look about you;</L>

<P>Friend PETER, mine.</P>
<LG>
<L>You look as stiff as a Divine</L>
<L>Of pedant class, yet a dull Writer,</L>
<L>Just elevated to the Mitre.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Friend, thou hast quite mistook thy Man.</L>
<L>I'm not of the pedantic clan,</L>
<L>But of that peaceful friendly tribe</L>
<L>Of Christians, <HI>Quakers</HI> call'd in gibe.</L>
<L>Our faith thou know'st, however oddly</L>
<L>'Tis mock'd and treated by th' Ungodly,</L>
<PB N="17" REF="22"/>
<L>Is simple, pure, and apostolic,</L>
<L>From priest-craft freed and rites symbolic.</L>
<L>All insults in our breasts we smother;</L>
<L>When one Cheek's smit, we turn the other.</L>
<L>We're meek, devout: each day is pass'd,</L>
<L>As if we knew 'twould be our last.</L>
<L>We never preach for tithes or hire:</L>
<L>Canst thou say this of Priest, or Friar?</L>
<L>Nay will the <HI>Pope,</HI> call'd Heaven's Vicegerent</L>
<L>By those to <HI>Romish</HI> faith adherent,</L>
<L>Will He, this sly <HI>Wolf</HI> in <HI>Sheep's</HI> clothing,</L>
<L>His <HI>Rostrum</HI> mount, and preach for <HI>nothing?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But to be brief. I cross'd th' <HI>Atlantic</HI></L>
<L>Even twice (some Scoffers thought me frantic)</L>
<L>To preach Repentance, for which few care,</L>
<L>And this without one hope of Lucre:</L>

<L>Nay at th' expence of worldly store,</L>
<L>Can either Thee, or <HI>Paul</HI> say more?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At such blunt question piqued th' Apostle,</L>
<L>Thinking himself us'd by the Ghost ill,</L>

<L>Of Sin original, and offences,</L>
<L>To which the youthful mind propense is,</L>
<L>We're cur'd by <HI>Dipping:</HI> None but We</L>

<L>Its purifying influence?</L>
<L>Sin often takes up its head quarters</L>

<PB N="21" REF="26"/>

<LG>
<L>My Friend, for Me you're too sophistic:</L>

<L>Speak to that point—Yet there's no need</L>

<L>The Sense of moral duties stifles—</L>
<L>Could we such zeal like liquors barrel,</L>

<L>The Ghost departed with his Guide,</L>

<LG>
<L>Saint, no aspersion—</L>
<L>I am—thank Heaven for my Conversion.</L>
<L>That I was born in sin 'tis true;</L>
<L>And, with submission, so were You.</L>
<L>But I've been purified by <HI>Grace;</HI></L>
<L>You see the marks on't in my face:</L>

<L>Well, no more words—Show me your Pass;</L>
<L>I question Methodists more closely:</L>

<L>It is, good Saint; but nothing new.</L>

<L>Despair so often o'er us stretches</L>
<L>Its veil, that we're our own <HI>Jack Ketches.</HI></L>
<L>Yet, in my Suicide, Despair is</L>
<L>As innocent as new-born Heiress.</L>
<L>I fear'd that <HI>Satan</HI> to his sultry</L>

<L>He, at our <HI>love-feasts</HI> (a fit crisis</L>
<L>By carnal pleasures to intice us)</L>
<L>With such a lustful itch inflam'd me,</L>
<L>That, but for Suicide, He'd damn'd me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thinking this doctrine strange, th' Apostle</L>
<L>Whistled as loud as lark, or throstle,</L>
<L>Then cried, Friend, I could wish to hear</L>

<L>A lovelier female ne'er did Man see</L>
<L>Than her, who caught my lustful fancy.</L>
<L>Of sixty turn'd my reverend Guide</L>
<L>Made her a Convert, then his Bride.</L>
<L>Her saintly looks at prayer and sermon</L>
<L>Were such, as could not fail to charm one:</L>
<L>Her modest air in household station</L>
<L>Gain'd universal approbation:</L>
<L>Yet now and then a random glance</L>
<L>Escap'd her, by design or chance,</L>
<L>Which this dear Woman indicated</L>
<L>Not <HI>thoroughly</HI> regenerated.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Twelve months before this Ardour seiz'd me</L>
<L>The Dame's respectful carriage pleas'd me:</L>
<L>She frequently would condescend</L>
<L>To call me her sweet-singing friend.</L>

<PB N="28" REF="35"/>
<LG>
<L>I struggled long in expectation</L>
<L>Of conquering my unruly passion:</L>
<L>Good <HI>Jacob</HI> with the <HI>Angel</HI> scarcely</L>
<L>Wrestled so stoutly and so fiercely.</L>
<L>Yet nothing would abate its vi'lence,</L>
<L>Except—In this excuse my silence.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Unable to subdue my flame,</L>
<L>I was resolv'd to sound the Dame.</L>
<L>At our next love-feast, I sat by her</L>
<L>Close as to <HI>Nun</HI> the liquorish <HI>Friar;</HI></L>
<L>The candles put out, from a notion</L>
<L>That darkness animates devotion.</L>
<L>I prais'd her beauty to the skies;</L>
<L>But above all her <HI>speaking</HI> eyes:</L>
<L>And each accomplishment ran over</L>
<L>With such a warmth, as spoke the lover.</L>
</LG>
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>
<LG>
<L>A wishful sigh this charming Woman</L>
<L>Breath'd out: I thought it a good omen;</L>
<L>And ventur'd, without hesitation,</L>
<L>T'inform her of my ardent passion;</L>
<L>Profess'd myself her warm adorer,</L>
<L>And all my sufferings laid before her:</L>
<L>Then squeez'd her hand with such a pressure,</L>
<L>As told my wishes to caress her.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She instantly return'd the Squeeze,</L>
<L>Which signal could not fail to please;</L>
<L>And strait began my hand to pat on—</L>
<L>You see' twas all the work of <HI>Satan.</HI></L>
<L>Nothing, good Saint, but time and place</L>
<L>Was wanting for the wish'd embrace.</L>
<L>In the next night we both agreed</L>
<L>To perpetrate th' ungodly deed.</L>

<L>All this in whispers pass'd: no List'ner</L>

<LG>
<L>We parted: I to bed betook me,</L>
<L>But Sleep, like a false friend, forsook me.</L>
<L>The pleasing thoughts, of what would happen</L>
<L>Nextnight, three hours kept mefrom napping.</L>
<L>I fell asleep, and dream'd I view'd</L>
<L>My poor old Mother in a shroud,</L>
<L>Who cried, "My dearest Son, beware</L>
<L>"Of falling into <HI>Satan's</HI> snare:</L>
<L>"Remember a kind Mother's inkling"—</L>
<L>Which said, she vanish'd in a twinkling.</L>

<PB N="31" REF="38"/>
<LG>
<L>I wak'd, much by the dream affected,</L>
<L>And on my pillow thus reflected.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shall I, t'indulge a lawless lust,</L>
<L>Be so ingratefully unjust</L>
<L>As cuckold Him, to whom I owe</L>
<L>So many obligations?—No.</L>
<L>He chang'd me from a raking <HI>Weaver</HI></L>
<L>Into a sober stanch <HI>Believer;</HI></L>
<L>And made me (an undoubted mark</L>
<L>Of friendship) <HI>tabernacle</HI> Clerk,</L>
<L>By which preferment I got over</L>
<L>My worldly wants, and liv'd in Clover.</L>
<L>Nay he has promis'd me to sound</L>
<L>A Widow, worth three thousand pound,</L>
<L>The Relict of a Tallow-Chandler,</L>
<L>And given me hopes that I shall handle her—</L>
<PB N="32" REF="39"/>
<L>Sooner than make such Friend a Cuckold,</L>
<L>I'd even to <HI>Endor's Witch</HI> be buckled.</L>

<LG>
<L>I rose; but knowing 'twould be vain</L>
<L>T'expect deliverance from Lust's chain,</L>
<L>My breast continuing still to burn as</L>
<L>Hotly, as <HI>Daniel's</HI> fiery furnace,</L>
<L>I took a Sermon from the shelf,</L>
<L>Read it, and pray'd—then hang'd myself.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus I've by Suicide eschew'd</L>
<L>Adult'ry, and Ingratitude;</L>
<L>Crimes, which my Soul to Hell had steer'd,</L>
<L>If Conscience had not interfer'd.</L>

<L>My Friend, this Passport's your acquittance,</L>
