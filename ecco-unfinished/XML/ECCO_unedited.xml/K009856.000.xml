<HEAD>PREFACE—by TIM.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we are delighted with the writings of an author, as I make no doubt but every sensible reader of the following poem will be, we naturally have a desire to be acquainted with his private history and character; that this observation is true, is manifest from its having been made fifty thousand times, and therefore it shall serve me to introduce the very brief account I shall at present give of poor Peter, the Author of this excellent Satire—Know then, gentle Reader, Peter was born in the north of England, of honest though but poor parents, and edu∣cated at a good Grammar-School, from which his Father, against Peter's inclinations, took him away to bind him apprentice to a Tanner, an occupation he did not greatly approve, for he could never endure the smell of hides; he had not been in this situation above a year before his Father died, upon which Peter run away from his Indentures, and went and resided some time with an intimate acquaintance who had been his
<PB N="viii" REF="4"/>school-fellow; this person was a man of polite taste, and a good classical scholar: by his con∣versation Peter so greatly improved his genius, which was naturally poetical, that he composed several Pastorals and some rural descriptions, by which he acquired great reputation—The Love of Glory, and an ardent desire to converse with the Learned, brought him up to Town the lat∣ter end of the year 1753: He flattered himself that he should be able to procure a comfortable subsistence by his scattered poetical performances; but alas he was mistaken! for that kind of merit is not now encouraged—all the money he ever received for his works was only one Guinea of a Bookseller for an excellent Poem, by which I have heard the Proprietor got a hundred. This general discouragement depressed his spirits to such a degree, that it threw him into a sort of a melancholy, which in a short time put a period to his existence, for he died the beginning of this month to the inexpressible grief of all his acquaintance—In his Box was found fairly transcribed for the press, a Poem in two Books, the first of which we now submit to the Public; if it meets with encouragement the second may shortly make its appearance—</P>

<L>This Sofa was the gift of Indolence:</L>

The Pope has not only been pleas'd to grant him three different audiences, but has declared him, by Patent, Medicine Oculist to his Person and Court, and to give him yet a greater mark of his favour, has caused him to be made Chevalier of his court, to be received as a member of the Roman senate, and a fellow of the Roman university. The Patents of these dignities, together with all the others he has received from the courts and univer∣sities abroad, are in the hands of his son in London. By a list it appears, that the Che∣valier is now Physician-Oculist (by Patent) to six crown'd heads, to near twenty sovereign princes; member of almost all the universi∣ties, academies, and societies of the learned in Europe. That he is the author of 24 different works that he has wrote himself in different languages, three of which are pub∣lished in Italian. And, to complete all, he was received as a member of the university of Padua by Order of the senate of Venice, with distinct approbation from the famous professor Morgany: And this crowned by the dignities he has received from the court and senate of Rome. The Chevalier will direct his course through Italy, where he will end his tour through all Europe. <HI>Medicus sum.</HI></NOTE></L>
