<HEAD>A
LETTER
TO THE
DISSENTERS.</HEAD>
<P>NO Man of Wisdom among you will say you are
above Advice; and Charity bids us hope you
are not past it.</P>
<P>If you reject the Counsel of those that design
your Good, your Friends will have the Misfortune to fail
in their good Design of Serving you: But the Disaster
of not being Serv'd will be your own.</P>
<P>Whoever has the general Good of <HI>Britain</HI> at Heart,
will be concern'd when they see any part of its Inhabitants
taking Measures to destroy the Publick Peace; and who∣ever
is concern'd for the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> and is a Friend to
their Interest, will be very sorry to see them under any
Insatuations, and would be very glad to contribute, by all
Means possible, to awaken them to their own Safety, be∣fore
they have made their Mischiefs irretrievable by their
own inexcusable Weakness.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dissenters,</HI> in former Reigns, were represented to
us as Enemies to the Church, of Factious and Seditious
Principles, dangerous to Government and to Monarchy,
and Enemies to <HI>Caesar,</HI> and had much Trouble given them
on those Accounts: When it was thus with them, they ne∣ver
fail'd to protest their Innocence, their Loyalty to the
Government, their Zeal for the Preservation of the Per∣son
of the King, and declar'd they desired nothing but the
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
Liberty of their Consciences, and of Worshipping God
after their own Manner; and that this being granted them,
they would be fully satisfied, and testify by their Beha∣viour,
that all they desired of the Government was (using
their own Words) <HI>To live peaceably and quietly under it,
in all Godliness and Honesty.</HI> They cannot reasonably ex∣pect
these Professions of theirs, which had so much In∣fluence
on their new Privileges, can now be forgotten:
And it highly concerns them to behave so under the Li∣berty
they have obtained, as that the <HI>Church of</HI> England
should have no Reason to reproach them with the Immo∣rality
of those Protestations, or to believe that they were
not sincere.</P>
<P>Moderate Men, who are inclined to Peace, gave easie
Credit to these Protestations, and were thereby moved to
acquiesce at that time in the Government's giving Liberty
of Worship to the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> hoping by that means to
have the Sincerity of those Professions testified by a quiet
and peaceable Behaviour: And the whole Body of the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> at the time of the Revolution, wil∣lingly
join'd in taking off the Edge of Penal Laws, so far
as it concern'd the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> exempting them by Act of
Parliament from the Restraints and Penalties which they
were subject to on account of their Religious Worship,
and allowing them by legal Authority that Liberty of Wor∣ship
and Freedom of Meeting and Assembling for the Ser∣vice
of God, which they had so often publickly affirmed
to be the Sum of their Desires.</P>
<P>It was expected by all those who wished well to the
<HI>Dissenters,</HI> that as on the one hand they (the <HI>Dissenters</HI>)
had received frequent and repeated Assurances from the
Throne, of the Satisfaction their Soveraign took in having
laid such great Obligations upon them to be Faithful,
Loyal, and Zealous for the Publick Good; so, on the o∣ther
hand, they would express upon all Occasions the Sense
they had upon them of the Obligation, and would con∣vince
not their Sovereign only, but the Church of <HI>England</HI>
also, that the Liberty so readily and from such good
Principles granted to <HI>Dissenters,</HI> was not misplaced or gi∣ven
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
to a People who did not know how to use it; that
they would now make good what they had always chal∣lenged
to be their Character, and what they had profes∣sed
to be their utmost Desire, (viz.) <HI>To live peaceable and
quiet Lives, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>To encourage them to do this, it has been the constant
Study of her present Majesty, ever since her Accession to
the Throne, to remove all the Causes of Jealousy and Un∣easiness
from the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> as to their said Tolerations,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and even to check the real Designs of any who at∣tempted
to put Restraints upon them. And although Oc∣casional
Conformity was become too much the Practice of
the <HI>Dissenters</HI> (an unjustifiable thing even in the Judgment
of the most Conscientious among themselves) and in pro∣cess
of time grew up to such a height as to enervate the
Laws, became Scandalous to Religion, and Matter of Jea∣lousy
and Uneasiness to the Church; yet her Majesty on
several Occasions discouraged the Attempts made to sup∣press
it, profess'd frequently from the Throne her Resolu∣tion
to preserve the aforesaid Toleration and Exemption
inviolable, and, as far as in Her lay, prevented the pas∣sing
a Law, even against the Occasional Conformity, till
the united Voice of Her People, and even of those whom
the <HI>Dissenters</HI> themselves owned for their particular Pro∣tectors,
claim'd it of Her Majesty in a Parliamentary way,
as absolutely necessary for the Publick Safety, and as a Thing
so Essential to the National Good, as that there was not a
Voice in either House against it.</P>
<P>After this, it must be very surprizing if we should find
the <HI>Dissenters</HI> either fail in the Performance of those En∣gagements,
or of their Duty and Gratitude to their Sove∣reign,
who has in so singular a manner granted them her
Favour and Protection: It must turn upon the <HI>Dissen∣ters</HI>
extremely to their Disadvantage, if it shall be found
that notwithstanding their aforesaid frequent Protestations
of their Innocence, and of their being free from the afore∣said
Charge of being Factious and Seditious, either by
Principle or Inclination, they now actually appear siding
and joyning with an Enraged Disaffected Party and Fa∣ction,
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
who having evil and unwarrantable Designs in
view, have endeavoured to ensnare and draw in the <HI>Dis∣senters</HI>
to take part with them in the most unjust
and undutiful Behaviour to their Sovereign, and to
oppose the most just and unexceptionable Measures of Her
Government, on pretence of Civil Grievances, which
have no other Foundation than in the Discontents of cer∣tain
Statesmen, whom Her Majesty, according to Her un∣disputed
Right and legal Authority, has thought fit to
dismiss from their Employments: And, which would be
still more wonderful, to see them joyn in the most pro∣voking
Insults, and the most undutiful Treatment of Her
Majesty's Person, as well as of her Government, and this
with such naked and unguarded Conduct, as if they co∣veted
to have it known, that the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> casting off all
Duty and Respect to Her Majesty, had openly professed
a Disaffection to the Person and Government of their
Prince, who, on the other Hand, by all possible Clemen∣cy
and Beneficence had, as is above noted, endeavoured
in the highest manner to engage and oblige them.</P>
<P>If these Things are justly laid to the Charge of the <HI>Dis∣senters,</HI>
and should be proved upon them, it must necessa∣rily
lay them open to very just Reflections. And albeit
this Letter, which is designed meekly to Admonish and
Persuade them, shall not accuse them of the Facts; never∣theless
it must in a friendly manner acquaint them that
these Things are laid to their Charge, with several Ag∣gravations,
which are not repeated here, because the De∣sign
is not to burthen them with a Recapitulation of
Crimes, but rather to lead them faithfully by the Hand
to such Measures as may conduce to their own Safety,
Honour and Peace.</P>
<P>Yet we must not omit to let them understand, that
there is one Aggravation of their Conduct insisted on by
those who now blame them, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That they seem to be
concern'd least we should say they are drawn in, and un∣warily
ensnared in their Engagements with the <HI>Faction</HI>
or Party beforementioned; but that, on the contrary,
they have made their Conjunction with them in an ex∣traordinary
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
manner, particularly in that they submitted
quietly to be made a Sacrifice in their Religious Concerns
by that same Party, whom we alledge they so affectio∣nately
espouse, rather than lose the Oportunity which
they were made to believe would thereby be put into their
Hands, to overthrow the Persons into whose Hands Her
Majesty had thought fit to entrust the Administration of
the Publick Affairs: And that notwithstanding they
have been actually so Sacrificed by the said Party, yet
such has been the eager desire of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> to pro∣mote
and to support the said Opposition to Her Majesty,
that they still continue to embrace and embark with the
very Persons who so Sacrificed them and their Interest as
<HI>Dissenters;</HI> Testifying thereby, that they were more zea∣lous
for carrying on a Faction in the Civil Government,
than for enjoying or preserving their Religious Liberties,
which, as is said before, they had appeared so much con∣cern'd
about in former Times.</P>
<P>These Occasions presenting, and a Charge of such a
Nature lying against the greatest part of the <HI>Dissenters,</HI>
it is offered in a friendly manner to advise and expostulate
with them; with respect to their present Conduct, and
their future Interest, that they may be prevailed with to
consider, <HI>before it be too late,</HI> what is the true State of
their Case; and not precipitate themselves and their In∣nocent
Posterity into that Ruin, which, if they do not
immediately alter their Behaviour, must be inevitable to
Both.</P>
<P>Yet ere we proceed to this Expostulation, and in order
to clear the way from just Exceptions, it is needful to ex∣plain
the meaning of the words FACTION and PARTY,
as they are made use of in this <HI>Letter.</HI> The Division of
the People into <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory</HI> has been too long, and the
Party the <HI>Dissenters</HI> have been known to adhere to, is too
Publick to have any Charge lie against them now for be∣ing
<HI>Whigs:</HI> Nor shall this <HI>Letter</HI> go about to persuade
them to be otherwise. <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory</HI> are not the Species
of the present Parties; but the Division lies between the
New Ministry and the Old, and their respective Depen∣dencies:
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
And we find, that as there are many <HI>Tories</HI>
who are against the present Ministry in several Things, as
Interests and Prospects guide them; so, many of those
who have always distinguished themselves as <HI>Whigs,</HI> and
continue to be so; n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, many <HI>Dissenters,</HI> and who still
remain so in their Principles, many who have always
professed themselves <HI>Whigs,</HI> as to Government, the
Revolution, the Succession, Liberty and Property,
and the like Things, the Heads of former Disputes, are
entirely in the Interest of the present Ministry. For this
reason, the Opposers of the present Administration are
not treated as <HI>Whigs,</HI> or <HI>Tories,</HI> being composed of Both;
but are stiled throughout this <HI>Letter</HI> a FACTION, and
most justly so, because they apparently act contrary to the
Duty, Faith and Allegiance of Subjects, in opposition to
the peaceable, just and gentle Government of their So∣vereign
Prince. As such then, let an impartial View be
taken of the State of Things.</P>
<P>It cannot reasonably be expected that the Heat and Fury
of the Parties now contending can continue long, as it now
stands. Let any reasonable Person cast his Eye upon
Publick Affairs, and it will immediately occur to him,
that no Government can be supposed long to bear being
Insulted and Treated as we see now practised by the said
FACTION, in defiance of legal Authority, in contempt
of the Majesty of the Throne, and of the Justice of the
Executive Power. For any one to tell the <HI>Dissenters</HI>
that the QUEEN, or the Government do not see, or
seeing do not resent such Behaviour, would be to com∣pliment
them at the expence of Her Majesty's Under∣standing,
or to flatter them at the expence of their own.
It cannot then be imagined that the Government will al∣ways
sit still and suffer the Indignities, the Reproaches,
and the scandalous Treatment which it now bears with.
The Clemency of the QUEEN, and the Forbearance
and Moderation of a Ministry, are a Blessing to a Nation,
when practised in their due Measure, but become Cri∣minal
to themselves, and Injurious to the Publick Safety,
when they suffer themselves to be so Insulted, as to bring
Authority it self into Contempt.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="9"/>
The publick Embarassments of the War, out of which
the <HI>Faction</HI> first hoped the Ministry could never extricate
themselves, and then Reproached them for having done
it, notwithstanding the popular Clamour and Opposition
made to hinder it, may have caused the said Ministry to
bear with all the lesser Inconveniencies of our Home-Dis∣orders:
But is it not manifest that this Forbearance has
so far been misimprov'd at Home, as to bring things to
this <HI>Crisis,</HI> that now the Government must think of Mea∣sures
to crush and suppress Tumult and Faction; or re∣solve
quietly and cowardly to sink under it, and fall a Sa∣crifice
to a merciless, enraged Party?</P>
<P>The <HI>Dissenters,</HI> notwithstanding the smooth Words made
use of by their new Friends to perswade them, or the Me∣naces
they use against the QUEEN and Her Ministers,
cannot be so weak to think that Her Majesty, and the Mi∣nistry
under Her, after having with a surprizing Success
gone through the first Difficulties of this Matter, and ha∣ving
brought the Publick Affairs so near a happy Settle∣ment,
can want Power, or are at a Loss for the proper
Measures to subdue the Remains of a Discontented Party;
a Party, who by the effectual Disappointment of all their
Measures, are dwindled and sunk into a disconcerted Rab∣ble,
a meer confused, disunited and dispersed Mob; whose
Rage now is vented in reviling of Persons, and in a Fury
that merits Correction, but is not capable of giving any just
Apprehension to those it is pointed against.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dissenters</HI> cannot be so weak to think that they are
able to support this <HI>Faction,</HI> and by joining with them to
do any thing but partake of their Punishment. Are the
<HI>Dissenters</HI> strong enough to support a Faction against their
Sovereign! It would be the greatest Injury in the World to
the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> for any Man to suggest such a Thing of them:
Because it would of consequence arm the Government a∣gainst
the <HI>Dissenters</HI> in general, and make it necessary to
fall upon the <HI>Dissenters</HI> as a Body, in order thereby, <HI>first,</HI>
to satisfy the <HI>Dissenters</HI> that the Party they are join'd with,
cannot be able to answer their Expectation, <HI>and then</HI> to
satisfy the Party that the Interest of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> is not
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
able to support them. If then the <HI>Dissenters</HI> cannot pro∣mise
to support this Party, why should they desire to fall
with them? Why should the <HI>Dissenters</HI> hazard the Privi∣leges,
Liberty and Safety, which they now enjoy under a
mild and just Administration, and run into an Adventure,
in which, if they miscarry, they alone will be Losers.</P>
<P>It is manifest the Hazard is not equal: The <HI>Faction</HI> are
but where they were, if their Attempts fail. Their Argu∣ments
are of kin to those of the Lepers of <HI>Samaria:</HI> As they
now are, they are Undone, outed of Places, of Employ∣ments,
Disgraced and Dismissed. If they succeed in the
Attacks they make upon the Ministry, they flatter them∣selves,
<HI>though vainly too,</HI> they may come in again: If they
miscarry, they are but Undone, and can fall no lower; and
it is time enough to be quiet, when all Efforts to recover are
tried, and prove in vain.</P>
<P>But it is not thus with the <HI>Dissenters:</HI> They enjoy
much, possess great Privileges, which may depend much
upon the Favour and Clemency of the Government they
live under, and which they ought not to run the Hazard of
forfeiting; nay, it would be Madness in them to run the
Hazard of forfeiting them. It is evident, that the <HI>Dissen∣ters</HI>
can expect no greater Privileges or Advantages than
they now enjoy, what Party soever Reigns. What have
the <HI>Dissenters</HI> to do with Parties in the Government? It is
as clear as the Light, which Party soever succeeds, they
can never be better in their Religious Concerns than they
are. Their Case is the Reverse of the other: The <HI>Dis∣senters</HI>
are well, and had been better but for the Occasio∣nal
Bill, which this very Party brought upon them. If
they are quiet and sit still, they are safe, and are sure to
keep what they have; if they join with those People, they
have only this Circumstance before them, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That if
they succeed, they cannot be better; and if they fail, they
my be undone.</P>
<P>It is then a most mysterious Folly in the <HI>Dissenters</HI> to push
themselves into this Broil. The Faction know the Force of
this Argument; and to evade it, would fain draw the <HI>Dis∣senters</HI>
in to suppose their Civil Rights are in Danger, and to
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
bring them, by a certain Thing which they mistakingly
call a <HI>Publick Spirit,</HI> to hazard their Religious Liberty for
the securing their Civil Liberty. This is a Heresy in Po∣liticks
not heard of before, and is the Reverse of all Chri∣stian
Duty. It has been often practised by Christians, and
is deservedly applauded by good Men, that all Civil Li∣berties,
Properties and Privileges should be hazarded, nay
lost and relinquish'd, to preserve Religious Liberties; but
the other Part was never, as I read of, allowed by any
Christians in the World, till the modern Christianity of
the present Parties among us have recommended it.</P>
<P>The next Evasion made use of, to draw in the <HI>Dissen∣ters</HI>
to take part in the present Quarrel of a Faction as a∣bove,
is, That our Constitution being in Danger, they
should distinguish themselves, and stand in a double Ca∣pacity
of Interest, (<HI>viz.</HI>) as <HI>Britons</HI> on one hand, and as
<HI>Dissenters</HI> on the other.</P>
<P>This is such an Evasion as is usual with the Authors of
Tumult and Sedition, and is something of kin to that for∣mer
Distinction of Fighting against the <HI>Person</HI> of the King,
but not against the <HI>Authority</HI> of the <HI>King;</HI> and as to the <HI>Dis∣senters,</HI>
is something like that Distinction which the <HI>Dutch</HI>
are said to have made in <HI>Japan,</HI> between <HI>Christians</HI> and
<HI>Hollanders.</HI></P>
<P>Before the <HI>Dissenters</HI> can distinguish themselves thus,
they must
assign some Reason, as <HI>Britons,</HI> why they should
oppose their Sovereign; not as <HI>Dissenters:</HI> They must
charge Her Administration with some Illegal arbitrary
thing, and then tell us why they appear as a Body of <HI>Dis∣senters</HI>
in a Case which, if it were true, they ought to ap∣pear
as <HI>Britons</HI> meerly, and in Conjunction with the Church
only, and in Defence of the Constitution; not as <HI>Dissenters</HI>
with a Party against a Government under whom the Con∣stitution
remains entire and unbroken, and against whom
they cannot alledge the least Breach of the Laws of Go∣vernment.</P>
<P>We have not yet seen wherein they so much as pretend
to charge the Government or the Ministry with the Breach
of the Constitution, with dispensing Power, arbitrary Go∣vernment,
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
or suspending the Execution of the Law, except
only in delaying to punish the most insolent Treatment
that ever any Government suffered in this Nation, till the
Guilty presume upon that criminal Clemency, and haugh∣tily
suggest it to be the Effect of Fear.</P>
<P>We have not yet seen them Impeach their Prince of Ty∣ranny
or arbitrary Government, or of any Breach of Her Royal Duty;
and we may adventure to say they cannot,
except the Sin of too much Mercy, which they may find a
time to repent the Abuse of; and to know that though it
has gone far, yet it will have an End, and may be pro∣voked
beyond the Power of longer Forbearing.</P>
<P>We have not seen them charge the Ministry with Trans∣gressing
the Bounds of their Duty, or of the Laws, except
in Generals, which is unjust and unfair. Why do they not
tell the People what the Crimes are which the Admini∣stration
is charged with, and what the Punishments which
the Laws have made their due? What can they impeach
the Ministry of? Where is the Treasure wasted, the Ta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣es
misapplied, the Funds interrupted, the Families en∣riched
out of the publick Spoils? Is it possible that all this
Violence can be shewn against the Ministry, and no Im∣peachment
drawn up! No Rapine, no Treason, no Misuse
of Power laid to their Charge! All the Crime we yet hear
of, is, That they are Ministers of State, and that others,
who desire to be in their Places, are not so: To re-obtain
which, they would raise all the Confusions in their Coun∣try
that were possible, and divide us into Factions and Par∣ties,
as if the Safety of the Nation depended not upon the
Administration it self, but the Persons who are employed
in it. And what have the <HI>Dissenters</HI> to do in this? Of
what essential moment is it to them whom the Queen em∣ploys
in the Administration, so the Persons employed guide
the State by legal Methods according to the Constitution?
Is this of Concern enough to the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> that they
should embroil themselves with the Government about it,
and hazard all their Religious Advantages, which now
they enjoy, in the private Quarrel of a Faction? Unac∣countable
Folly! What will they say to their Children af∣ter
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>
them, if it should appear that on such Accounts as
these, and with such Views, and to carry on such Designs,
they lose the Religious Liberty they enjoyed, and oblig'd
the Government to abridge and cut them short for the
mere necessary Preservation of the Publick Peace?</P>
<P>How will this for ever open the Mouths of the <HI>Dissen∣ters</HI>
Enemies against them, and cause them to say, That
all that had been formerly said of them was True, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
of their being a turbulent unpeaceable People, Enemies to
Government, restless under Restraint, that sought not so
much the Liberty of their Religion as a Liberty from all
Government; that, if they were tolerated in the Exercise
of their Worship, would still remain Dissatisfied, Factious
and Uneasy; be ever disturbing the Repose of the State,
and on all Occasions join with those that should disturb it.
What can the <HI>Dissenters</HI> have to say, to vindicate them∣selves
from that Calumny, unless they consider it in time,
and alter their present Conduct?</P>
<P>Formerly, as is said, they alledged that all was false
which was said against them of this kind; that they desi∣red
only Liberty of Religion, were harmless, inoffensive
People, faithful to the Government, and chearfully Obe∣dient
to the Laws, seeking only the Ease of ther Consciences
in Matters purely Religious; that in the Affair of the Re∣volution,
they only join'd with the Church in resisting
Arbitrary Government, and endeavouring to maintain the
Laws and Constitution, the natural Rights of Englishmen,
and the like; and there being no immediate Charge against
them to the contrary, many People gave Credit to them
in this matter: But now when the Laws are uninvaded,
the Constitution entire and unbroken, no Encroachments
made on Liberty no Violence on Property, no Oppression,
no Injustice offered them, their Religious Liberties granted
them to their full Satisfaction, nay their Schools and Semi∣naries
allow'd them, though by Law they may and ought
to be suppressed; for them to bandy against the Govern∣ment
now! for them to abett a restless Faction, and fall in
with a Sett of Malecontents to embroil and enflame the
People now! for them to insult the Queen and the Mini∣stry
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>
now! What can be said for this, but that it is the
mere Essence and Spirit of Sedition? And what can be the
Consequence, but that it will oblige the Government to
teach them their own Interest by Methods more mortify∣ing
than they otherwise intended to do, and to take from
them the Power of doing the Mischief they seem to have
Will to bring to pass?</P>
<P>That the Government have Power to do this, and that
too many Ways are left to humble the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> it would
be lost time to contend about; they cannot be so ignorant
as not to know it.</P>
<P>But before I come to mention that Part, it will be need∣ful
to examine a little the farther Views and Prospects,
upon which the Party we speak of have drawn the <HI>Dissen∣ters</HI>
to act with them in these Tumults and Disorders, and
what it is that the <HI>Dissenters</HI> can rationally propose to them∣selves
in the greatest Success of the Faction they are siding
with. For it cannot be imagined of the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> but
that, like all reasonable Creatures, they propose some End
to themselves in every Action before they engage in it,
much more in Actions of such Consequence as taking Sides
in the <HI>Brouilleries</HI> of the State: They must then have some
rational Views to justify their Actions to themselves, or at
least some pretences of rational Views. Let us enquire, as
far as we have Light into them, what they are.</P>
<P>The main Pretence with which the Party have for a
long time alarm'd the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> is, the Danger of the
<HI>Pretender,</HI> and the Interest they have in the Protestant
Successor. How this can have obtained so far upon Men of
a peaceable Disposition, as Charity bids us suppose the
<HI>Dissenters</HI> to be, is mysteriously strange, the utmost Rea∣son
that has yet been given for that Jealousy, having been
founded on mere Suggestion, malicious Cavils, and the
bold Allegations of partial and prejudiced Men, without
any real Ground or sufficient Evidence of Fact against any
one Person in the Administration. Not one Step has been
taken, either by the Queen or Her Ministers of State, to∣wards
weakning the Protestant Succession, or encouraging
the <HI>Pretender,</HI> unless renewing Laws to enforce the Ab∣juring
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
the <HI>Pretender</HI> by Name, obliging the <HI>French</HI> King
to Renounce him, and to engage on the Faith and Honour
of a King, for Himself and his Posterity, never to aid, as∣sist,
or encourage him to attempt us, and in the mean time
to expel him from his Court, and from his Dominions, and
to acknowledge the Title of the House of <HI>Hanover;</HI> I say, unless
these are to be esteemed as Grounds of Suspicion and
Encroachments of the <HI>Pretender.</HI></P>
<P>It might be enquired here, Why is the <HI>Protestant Suc∣cession</HI>
endeavoured to be made the immediate Strife? The
QUEEN (God be praised) notwithstanding a Thousand
scandalous Reports, is in a good State of Health, and gives
no room to make any thing of the Succession our immediate
Concern, except its future Certainty, and as to the future
Security and Certainty of the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succession, what
more can be done? The Laws have Established it, the
QUEEN has declared for it, the Ministry have not done
the least thing in prejudice of it; the mentioning it then
can be with no View but to keep the People alarm'd and
uneasie; seeing nothing can be desired, even by the House
of <HI>Hanover</HI> themselves, to make their Succession safe, more
than is already done in a Legal and Parliamentary way.</P>
<P>But these People injure the House of <HI>Hanover,</HI> and the
Succession it self, in their Conduct, by Threats of what
shall be done to Persons and Parties, when the <HI>Hanover</HI>
Succession takes place: It were to be wished those who
are true Friends to the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succession, would be
more wary in what they say and do of this kind, least they
Ignorantly assist a <HI>Jacobite</HI> Interest by those very Steps
which they think contribute to the Establishing the Line
of <HI>Hanover.</HI> Were the Princes of the House of <HI>Hanover</HI>
to see how they are, on the most frivolous Occasions,
thrown in the Faces of the most Loyal Subjects the QUEEN
has; how the aforesaid <HI>Faction</HI> Bullies the People with
<HI>Hanover</HI> Succession; and threatens the Ministry and all
their Friends with the Resentment of the Successor: They
would shew their Displeasure at it, and tell them plainly
that this is weakning, not strengthening, their Interest, by
making them Terrible to the Nation they are to Govern;
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
filling the Minds of the People with the Apprehen∣sions
of what Treatment they shall meet with from
the House of <HI>Hanover,</HI> which tends to arm their Minds
with Fear of, and consequently an Aversion to the Per∣son
of the Successor, and, by the same Rule, to the Suc∣cession
it self. Do these People think that the House of
<HI>Hanover</HI> so ill understand the Policy of Government, as
to come over hither prepared to Revenge the Quarrel of a
<HI>Faction?</HI> To espouse Parties, and to enter into the Re∣sentments
of a few enraged Men against the rest of the
Nation, who are to be equally their Subjects, and who
will have an equal Claim to their Favour and Protection?</P>
<P>What Inconceivable Injury do these People do to the
<HI>Protestant Successor!</HI> To endeavour to make him a
Terror to any of those who are to be his Subjects! To
threaten us beforehand with the Resentment of that Pow∣er,
which it is expected we should all concur to bring in,
and give up the Government to! It also merits some
Enquiry to know who they are, which this Resentment
is threatned against.</P>
<P>Are they not those whom the QUEEN Administers
Her▪ Government by? Whom Her Majesty declares
worthy of Her Favour, and fit to place the Royal Au∣thority
with? Would these Men persuade us then, that
the <HI>Protestant Successor</HI> shall so requite the QUEEN for
all that Concern shew'd by Her Majesty to establish the
Crown in their Family, by the Treaty of Union, and
many other ways, as to fall immediately upon the very
Persons who assisted Her Majesty in preserving the Suc∣cession
of the Crown to them entire? Is not this an irre∣parable
Injury to the <HI>Protestant Successor?</HI> An Injustice
he cannot but be sensible of and resent? Is it not the
only way to weaken, and finally to ruine the Succession
it self; and, as above, to make the <HI>Protestant Successor</HI>
the <HI>Terror,</HI> not the <HI>Desire of Great Britain?</HI></P>
<P>In the next place, the <HI>Dissenters</HI> would do well to con∣sider
what they in particular have to expect from the <HI>Pro∣testant
Successor.</HI> Can they expect more than they have?
Will the <HI>Protestant Successor</HI> favour them more, and do
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>
more for them than the QUEEN has done? Of what
sort can that Favour be? Can they hope he will take
off the <HI>Occasional Bill</HI> lately brought on by their own
Treacherous Friends? Or will he attempt to remove
the TEST, and promiscuously admit them into Places,
<HI>&amp;c?</HI> If this were really their Expectation, yet it would
savour of more Honesty than Discretion to say so: For
it would be an irreparable Injury to the <HI>Protestant Suc∣cessor</HI>
to make that Expectation be received by the People;
it would be such a Handle to the <HI>Pretender</HI> to take hold
of, as nothing could be equal to it, and would alarm the
Church of <HI>England</HI> against the Succession of <HI>Hanover,</HI> as
being dangerous to their Safety, and to the very Consti∣tution
of the Church. And thus you would Injure the
Succession which you appear so zealously to espouse.</P>
<P>What then can it be which should embark the <HI>Dissen∣ters</HI>
in the present Quarrel of Parties? In which, if they
knew or could discern their own Interest, they would at
least be Neuters; knowing that they must be Losers by
taking part in the Strife, which Side soever prevails;
and that they are never courted, but with a Design to be
used like <HI>David</HI>'s Heifers, first to draw the Cart, and
then to be burnt with the Wood of it. If then they had
a Sense not of their Obligation to their Sovereign only,
but of their own Civil and Religious Interests, they
would from the Beginning have appeared against these
things, by which they would have prevented the
Danger of having the Government oppressed by a
<HI>Faction,</HI> and the Necessity of the Ministry taking
Measures, and using Hands which they had no De∣sire
or Design to have taken or used; from which
Measures they never yet could see a safe Door of Re∣treat,
nor ever can, till the Edge of <HI>Faction</HI> and <HI>Se∣dition</HI>
is more effectually taken off, and the Rage of
<HI>Parties</HI> abated.</P>
<P>Let the <HI>Dissentenrs</HI> then ask themselves what particular
Views are proposed to them at this time, for which they,
<HI>as Dissenters,</HI> ought to meddle or embark themselves with
any Party? What have the <HI>Dissentenrs</HI> to do, <HI>as Dissenters,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
in the Broils about who is or is not employed in the State?
Is it not Interest of Persons, and Interest of Parties in the
publick Management that is the Quarrel? What is the
Question to them? And moreover seeing which Side soe∣ver
prevails, the <HI>Dissenters</HI> are sure to have no share in the
Management; Why should they have a share in the Hazard?</P>
<P>In embarking with these Men, the <HI>Dissenters</HI> can have
no hope but in the Success of those they embark with: If
that Success comes, they are under foot still, nay, <HI>the Fa∣ction</HI>
dare not say they will relieve the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> if they
should obtain the Victory; they dare not promise the <HI>Dis∣senters</HI>
the least Favour, or to redress the least of their
Grievances. To say that they but intend it, would be
to tell the Church-Party that they will lessen the Security
made by the Law for its Preservation; and let in the <HI>Dis∣senters</HI>
to such a share of Power as would be dangerous to
the Church: Nay, on the contrary, does not a Noble
Lord in a late Pamphlet, said to be of his Writing, pub∣lickly
recommend the present Discontented Party as the
Church's true and only Friends, <HI>because they have at</HI>
THIS TIME <HI>set their foot upon the</HI> Dissenters, <HI>and
for ever made them safe from giving the Church any Un∣easiness?</HI>
Can they then who recommend themselves by
your Oppression, give you hope of Recovery by their Suc∣cess?
As they have now occasionally used you, they are
Traitors to the Confidence you have placed in them; and
if they should restore you, they must be as Treacherous to
the Church, whom they court, and to whom they at this
time plead the Merit of your Destruction.</P>
<P>So that neither the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succession, nor the Success
or Restoration of the Party you espouse, can ever retrieve
your Case. On the other Hand, if the <HI>Faction</HI> miscarries,
as the Nation hopes, and honest Men pray, you have no∣thing
to hope for, <HI>as Dissenters,</HI> but what must be founded
on the Mercy and Clemency of Her Majesty, after the
greatest Prevarications you are able to be guilty of;
who tho' not inclin'd to Severity, may see Cause in
your Conduct to prevent your offering the like again,
and may teach you your Duty at the expence of that
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>
Liberty, which you will then most justly forfeit to the
Government.</P>
<P>The Sum therefore of this Part of the Advice to the
<HI>Dissenters,</HI> is, That they would be so Wise, and so be∣have
themselves, as not to make it necessary to the Go∣vernment
to resent their Conduct, and to oblige the Ex∣ecutive
Power, when they correct a Seditious Party, as
they must quickly do, to lend the <HI>Dissenters</HI> a Lash to
let them know their Duty, and make them taste what
they might justly expect a greater share of.</P>
<P>Why also should the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> who are a great tho'
not a powerful Body in the Nation, suffer themselves to
be made Tools of a Party? Are they not sure to be laid
by, and cast away by that very Party that use them, as∣soon
as the Dirty Work they are employ'd in, is over;
and sure to be worn out and ruin'd, if that Dirty Work
should not succeed? When will the <HI>Dissenters</HI> learn to
be Wise to their own Peace, and not meddle with Con∣tention,
which does not belong to them, which <HI>Solomon</HI>
says, <HI>is like one that takes a Wolf by the Ears?</HI></P>
<P>It should seem, that in these things, the Interest of the
<HI>Dissenters</HI> receives some Prejudice from the Influence
their Passion for a Party has upon their Judgment; other∣wise
they would consider some such Things as these:</P>
<P>Why should the <HI>Dissenters</HI> distinguish themselves by
their Animosity to the present Administration? Why en∣ter
into the Resentments of a few Men, who have given
so many Testimonies that the want of Power to aggran∣dize
themselves is their only Dissatisfaction?</P>
<P>Why should the <HI>Dissenters</HI> covet to be ill with their
Sovereign; and why signalize their Opposition to their
Prince in the Legal use of Her unquestion'd Preroga∣tive?</P>
<P>Why should the <HI>Dissenters</HI> oblige the Government to
take the first Occasion to lay their Hands upon them,
and to single them out as a People whom it is necessary
to humble for the Publick Safety?</P>
<P>Are the <HI>Dissenters</HI> under no particular Obligations to
the QUEEN as they are <HI>Dissenters?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="20"/>
Do the <HI>Dissenters</HI> enjoy no Advantages more than the
Law has provided for, and for which they are particular∣ly
indebted to the Favour of the QUEEN?</P>
<P>Is it no way in the QUEEN's Power to incommode
them or straiten them, or to make them uneasie as <HI>Dis∣senters?</HI></P>
<P>Can the Government Abridge them of nothing? Is
the QUEEN's Protection of them from Encroachments
and Insults of several kinds, of no Value to them?</P>
<P>Are they so sure of pushing the present Heats to the
Overthrow of the present Ministry, that they cannot fail?
and are they sure they shall lose nothing by the Miscar∣riage?</P>
<P>If they are obliged to the Favour and Protection of
the QUEEN for many Things, what Praise do they seek
in the Title of <HI>Ungrateful,</HI> that they should come so
much into the Mode? And, which is more than all,</P>
<P>Are they sure, there will never be a Parliament that
will resent an undutiful and ungrateful Behaviour to their
Sovereign?</P>
<P>Nay, Is not even the Toleration it self in the Hands of
the Parliament, and as much at the Mercy of the High Church,
who are push'd at in all these Intrigues, as even
themselves can desire?</P>
<P>These Things may be worth the present Consideration
of the <HI>Dissenters;</HI> and Questionless would they consider
them sedately, they would see some Weight in them, and
see some Ground to alter their present Conduct, and to
think their Engagements with their new Friends a more
dangerous Step to them than at present they are aware of.</P>
<P>From their Conduct as to their Sovereign, and the Ad∣ministration
of publick Affairs, come we to speak of their
Proceeding as to particular Persons. One would think
Prudence should move the <HI>Dissenters</HI> to take Care, in
falling in with the Party aforesaid, as to particular Per∣sons.
What Interest, or what Advantage can it be to the
<HI>Dissenters,</HI> to make themselves new Enemies? And espe∣cially
what can it avail them to force Men to be their E∣nemies
who would not be so? Nay, who have always
<PB N="21" REF="21"/>
shewn themselves friendly to their Interest, however o∣blig'd
by their Conduct not to be so to their Persons? Is
it Prudence in the <HI>Dissenters, as such,</HI> to place their only
Safety and Ease in the Overthrow of this or that Person
or Party? Does it not, by Consequence, oblige those
Persons or Parties to face upon them, and to see that on
the contrary their Safety consists in the Ruin and Over∣throw
of the <HI>Dissenters?</HI> And what Necessity are the
<HI>Dissenters</HI> in, of coming into such a Circumstance, espe∣cially
where the Victory is so doubtful, and the Mischief
in case of a Miscarriage so certain?</P>
<P>It is worthy the <HI>Dissenters</HI> Observation, That how∣ever
they may have been oppressed for private Ends not
so much concerning themselves, and often perhaps with
no immediate Design to destroy them; yet they have ne∣ver
been courted by any Party, but with a clear and o∣pen
Design to ruin and suppress them. And not to go
too far back in History to prove this, the <HI>Dissenters</HI> ha∣ving
had the Fate not to be much courted at any time,
the first Instance we meet with of this, is recent in Me∣mory;
<HI>viz.</HI> in the Time of the late King <HI>James</HI> II. His
Caressing the <HI>Dissenters</HI> had in it these two remarkable
Circumstances; first, that it was known he did not begin
it, till he had first tried all possible Methods with the
Church, and twice offered to make a Sacrifice of all the
<HI>Dissenters</HI> in the Kingdom to them, if they would have
come into his Measures; when failing in his Design on
that side, and finding them steady to the Constitution,
he faced about to the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> and offered them a like
Sacrifice of the Church; hoping by gratifying their
Revenge to gain their Help in his Design of mastering
the Laws, breaking in upon the Constitution, ruining the
Church and thereby the Protestant Religion, and at last
(mighty Favour!) the <HI>Dissenters</HI> themselves. Then it
was that the <HI>Dissenters</HI> were awakened by an excellent
Tract under the same Title of this, (<HI>viz.) A Letter to
a Dissenter,</HI> written by a <HI>Noble</HI> Author who was an emi∣nent
Tory, though a Friend to the Constitution and to
the Protestant Interest, (for such are consistent) <HI>viz.</HI> the
late Marquis of <HI>Hallifax.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="22"/>
How far the <HI>Dissenters</HI> were drawn into that Snare,
I would have chosen to see buried in the Merit of their
After-Conduct in the Revolution, where it not that I see
them now drawn into the like Evil with so much more
Art, but with a View equally fatal to themselves; a Plot
against the very Essence of their Liberty as <HI>Dissenters,</HI>
and the more likely to succeed, because they are brought
to that Condition as to see and know, that they are de∣sign'd
to be an Oblation or Peace-offering for their Party
to the Tories or High Church, whenever a Treaty of
Reconciliation shall commence; and yet that they are
contented to be so, and to espouse <HI>the Faction</HI> at that
Price.</P>
<P>To what a strange Infatuation are the <HI>Dissenters</HI> brought!
who, although under the mild and merciful Administra∣tion
of the present Queen they enjoy more Liberty than
the Laws direct, and are protected from many Insults
which they would be exposed to, if Her Majesty thought
fit to let them know their true Circumstances; yet are
willing to appear with a Party who have made the Op∣pression
of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> the express Condition of their
being restored! Was ever any Infatuation like this! What
can be said in Abatement for such Conduct, but must re∣flect
upon the very Understandings of the People we
speak of, except we should, to compliment the Senses of
the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> give up their Morals, and declare them
bent upon Rebellion and the Ruin of their Country;
Things, which it is very difficult to bring our Charity
to suspect them of,</P>
<P>It seems the Party who have carried the Delusions of
the <HI>Dissenters</HI> to such a Length, have done it by pos∣sessing
them with a degree of Contempt, first of the
Queen's Person, and then of Her Power. It is not hard
to impose upon the Judgment of a People in small Mat∣ters,
when they have d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne it in greater: When a Breach
is made upon our Duty and Affection to our Prince, it
follows that we contemn what we hate, and that we are
easy to be brought off from our Fear of that Power,
which we are prevail'd upon not to love.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="23"/>
It is very strange that the <HI>Dissenters</HI> should be pre∣vail'd
upon in either of these, and perhaps the Fact may
be denied in their Behalf. It were sincerely to be
wish'd that it were not true: And so tenderly shall the
<HI>Dissenters</HI> be handled in that case in this <HI>Letter,</HI> that I
shall choose rather to say, it has been attempted, and
they have been pressed and perswaded to contemn the
Resentments of the Government, than that they have
been prevail'd upon actually to do so.</P>
<P>But it may be as proper to use some Arguments with
them to shew the Weakness of this Delusion, be the Mat∣ter
of Fact one way or other, (<HI>viz.</HI>) whether they have
been prevail'd upon, or have only been perswaded and
attempted: In the one Case it is needful to prevent
their Mistakes; in the other to open their Eyes, and assist
them to retrieve it before it be to late to look back.</P>
<P>Let them reflect then, In what can their Contempt of
the present Power serve their Interest? and upon what
can it depend?</P>
<P>The Life of Her present Majesty is the chief thing
that I have observed the Party made use of, to habitu∣ate
this Contempt among the People. I have that Cha∣rity
for the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> as to believe, however they may
have heard this Argument made use of, though some
of them may have been weak enough to restrain their
open Dislike of it; yet their secret Thoughts have
resented it with a just Horror. It is not in the Con∣stitution
of a <HI>Dissenter,</HI> as such, to entertain Thoughts
so Unchristian, so Unnatural; and whatever the Delusi∣on
may have been, no Protestant <HI>Dissenter</HI> can calmly
and sedately say, that he wishes the Death of Her pre∣sent
Majesty, but his Conscience must admit some Hor∣ror,
and reproach him in a manner that cannot be quietly
born.</P>
<P>For this Reason, albeit some have been drawn in to
drink that Unchristian, Bloody, and Treasonable Health,
which now with an unheard of Impudence is made the
Test of the present Faction, (viz.) <HI>To send the House
of</HI> Hanover <HI>speedily to the Throne;</HI> nevertheless, I do
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>
not charge it upon the <HI>Dissenters</HI> as a Body, but I heartily
wish every <HI>Dissenter</HI> would, for their own sakes, and for
the Credit of Religion which they profess, or else cannot
be rightly called <HI>Dissenters;</HI> I say, that they would make
it a particular Mark of a <HI>Dissenter,</HI> to declare their Ab∣horrence
of a Thing every way so Criminal, seeing it is
no less than Cursing the Q—n, and drinking her Con∣fusion
as a Q—n, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That she would either spee∣dily
Dye, or speedily be Deposed.</P>
<P>As the Case now stands, He cannot wish well to this
Island, who does not wish the Protestant Succession, as
now established by Parliament, may in God's due time
take place, that the next Heir of the House of <HI>Hanover</HI>
being Protestant may quietly and peaceably succeed: But
he is a Traitor to his Country, a Murderer of the
Q—n, an Enemy to the Publick Peace, and an un∣grateful
Subject to an obliging merciful Prince, that can
wish even that Sucession should take place, till the course
of God's Providence has remov'd Her Majesty by the
Hand of Nature.</P>
<P>But not to mention that Time which every true Sub∣ject
thinks of with Regret, and desires to place as re∣mote
as possible, What is the Argument for which this
horrid Spirit possesses us? Is it more or less than this,
That they wish the Queen were dead, only the Mini∣stry
might be chang'd? Is not this Sedition in the Ab∣stract?
Is not wishing the Q—n dead, murdering the
Q—n? Is not wishing Her Majesty Deposed, an in∣tentional
Rebellion, and a Deposing the Q—n? Sup∣pose
this Hellish Thought gratified! Heaven guard
Her Majesty from the very Suggestion! It is a kind
of Treason but to suppose it! But what would this a∣vail
the Party? Are they assured this would answer
that part of the Design, and bring us to a Change of
Hands in the Administration? These Men are not a∣ware
of the Consequence of that Suggestion! Can you
serve the Interest of the <HI>Pretender</HI> more, than by pro∣moting
a general Opinion, that when the House of <HI>Han∣over</HI>
comes in, the Successor will immediately restore
<PB N="25" REF="25"/>
the Whigs, and turn out the present Ministry? For
my part, I dare not entertain the Thought, for the Hor∣ror
of its Consequences; for either way, for ought I
see, we are to be ruin'd.</P>
<P>If we should say, the Successor will employ the pre∣sent
Ministry, we arm all the aforesaid Faction against
the Protestant Succession: For, if they would be glad
the Q—n were dead, rather than the Old Ministry
should not come in (the Truth of which they have Fol∣ly
enough not to deny) with much more Charity may
we suppose, they had rather the <HI>Hanover</HI> House should
not Succeed than that the Old Ministry should not come
in; and consequently they would even join the <HI>Pre∣tender</HI>
to bring in the Old Ministry, if there were no
other way. Nor are they for the Protestant Succession
it self, but on a Presumption, that when they come to
Succeed, they shall immediately change Hands, and take
them into the Administration.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, if we say the Successor shall de∣pose
the present Administration, and overthrow the
<HI>High-Church</HI> Interest, then we make necessary the <HI>High-Church</HI>'s
being Enemies to the <HI>Protestant Succession</HI> of
<HI>Hanover,</HI> and justifie them in being so from your own
Practice. It is not so long since the present Disconten∣ted
People for the same Reason, (viz.) <HI>Their being out
of Place,</HI> were equally Discontented at the late Ministry
and made no scruple to Confederate with the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s
Party here, against the very Person of the late Lord
Treasurer <HI>G—n,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Marlborough:</HI>
The Truth of which needs not to be quoted from Prin∣ted
Relations, seeing there are Living Witnesses sufficient
to put it past the possibility of being Contradicted. And
nothing brought them off from that Confederacy, but the
taking them into the Administration, after which all the
Complaints of that Administration ceased, they became
Advocates of the very Mismanagement they had accused
the Ministry of, and never concerned themselves to re∣ctify
one of those Things, which they had called Abuses
before.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="26"/>
Thus it is a Dilemma they cannot remove, and can
give no rational Answer to, whether the Successor shall
change the Ministry, when he comes to the Crown, or
no? <HI>If he should not,</HI> as there is very good Ground to
believe from the Prudence, Wisdom and Judgment of
the Person we expect to Succeed, what strange Excesses
and ungrounded Follies do these Men run into, who car∣ry
their Heats to such a height, with a View which they
have no sufficient Ground to expect shall be answer'd;
although the Treasonable Horrid Suggestion of the De∣mise
of the Present QUEEN were now to happen.</P>
<P>But not to enter into the Follies of the <HI>Malecontents,</HI>
which is not the Design of this <HI>Letter,</HI> any farther than
it appears the <HI>Dissenters</HI> are engaged in them. It is the
Wish of every moderate Christian, who aims at the pub∣lick
Quiet, that the <HI>Dissenters</HI> would take some Leisure
seriously to examine their own Circumstances, upon what
Foundation their Liberty stands, whom they forfeit for,
as well as for themseves, if they provoke those too far
who cannot want Power to do themselves Justice upon
them: And above all, <HI>for what it is</HI> that they lay their
Religious Interest at Stake. Prudence requires all Wise
Men to weigh their Actions in the Ballance of Reason,
and to judge, whether there is any due Proportion be∣tween
the Hazard run and the End proposed. It seems
to be one of the most sensible Parts of the Miseries of a
future State, that the Spirits of the Wretched shall be
capable to reflect upon, and reproach themselves with
the sordid Trifles, for which they forfeited Eternal Hap∣piness.
How mean a Thing will the espousing a Party-Broil
appear in the Eyes of your Children, when they
shall compare it with the loss of an Established Liberty of
Conscience, and shall reflect that their Fathers forfeited
to the Publick Justice the Religious Liberties they en∣joy'd,
by their espousing <HI>Faction,</HI> and joyning in with a
Party against the just Administration of their beneficent
Sovereign; having at the same time not the least Challenge
against the said Administation, not one Law broken, not one
Privilege invaded, not one Act of arbitrary Power exer∣ted,
<PB N="27" REF="27"/>
no Oppression, no Injustice, no Tyranny to com∣plain
of?</P>
<P>In the next place, the <HI>Dissenters</HI> are exhorted to con∣sider
on what Terms they stand with the present Go∣vernment.
It is true, that Her Majesty has on all Oc∣casions
graciously been pleased to promise them Her
Royal Protection, and to preserve the Toleration inviola∣bly:
But do they suppose these Promises do not imply
the Condition of their Dutiful and Peaceable Conduct
and Behaviour? Or do they suggest that Her Majesty
is thereby bound in Honour to perform Her Promises in
the Letter of them; that they at the same time are left
at Liberty to offer the greatest Affronts to Her Person
and administration, upon the Presumption that their
Misbehaviour can no way affect her Majesty's Engage∣ments,
which are not at all reciprocal in their Obliga∣tions?</P>
<P>This has indeed been the very Practice of the Party
now embroiling this Nation; who, in the Case of the
War, use the QUEEN just after this manner, tho' it
must be acknowledged it is very Disingenuous. Her
Majesty, upon the Change of the late Ministry, not
supposing that Changing Hands only must immediately
oblige Her to Change all Her Measures, went on in the
very same Steps of Government as before, and for the
carrying on the War in Conjunction with Her Allies;
and frequent Assurances were given from the Throne, that
it was both Her Majesty's Opinion and Resolution to push
<HI>France</HI> on by a vigorous War, to give a safe and honour∣able
Peace to <HI>Europe,</HI> to restore the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy,
and satisfie all the Allies,</P>
<P>Immediately the Party thinking they had the Q—n
fast by the Letter of these Promises, fall to work to raise
Factions and Discontents at home, to ruine Credit, to
disable the Ministry, and to make it impossible for the
QUEEN to support that War, She had promised to carry
on: As if that Promise was not made on a Supposition of
the Dutiful Assistance and Concurrence of Her People;
and as if Her Majesty was so tied up, that when She
<PB N="28" REF="28"/>
should find a Design on foot to make that very War the
Ruine of Her Measures; should find Her Ministry op∣pressed
by a <HI>Faction,</HI> in hopes of plunging Her Affairs
into inextricable Difficulties; a Party raised as well a∣broad
as at home against Her Administration; and those
Men who were at the Head of Her Armies appearing open∣ly
at the Head of those Parties; and not to act counter to
Her Measures only; but to threaten openly to oblige Her
to a <HI>Revolution</HI> in Her Houshold: I say, as if upon
Discovery of such Designs carrying on, to make the War
impracticable, but at the hazard of the Peace at Home,
Her Majesty was not at liberty to change those Resoluti∣ons,
and regard the Safety of Her own Government, and
the Protection of Her faithful Servants from the Attacks
of an enraged Party!</P>
<P>In like manner it seems reasonable to suppose, that not∣withstanding
Her Majesty's gracious Promises to the <HI>Dis∣senters</HI>
of Protection, and maintaining inviolably their
Toleration, yet that this was always to be understood so
far Conditionally, that they behaved themselves Duti∣fully
to Her Person, Peaceably to the Government, and
kept themselves from embroiling the State; In the contra∣ry
to which it must be allowed to be very Just, if Her
Majesty should upon such Occasion recommend it to Her
Parliament. That whereas Her Majesty had upon all Oc∣casions
indulged the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> not only in the Tolera∣tion
and Exemption granted them by Law, but in seve∣ral
other Liberties which She might justly have restrained
them in; And whereas in might reasonably have been ex∣pected,
that the <HI>Dissenters</HI> would in return for such Fo∣vours
have distinguished themselves by their Dutiful and
Affectionate Behaviour to her Majesty's Person and Go∣vernment:
But that Her Majesty finding on the con∣trary
that the <HI>Dissenters</HI> in general are fallen in with a∣betting
and supporting the Factions and Discontents of a
Party, who with an undutiful Behaviour endeavour to
disturb the Peace of Her Majesty's Reign, and the just
Measures of Her Administration; And that they are not
by any peaceable gentle Methods to be reclaim'd from
<PB N="29" REF="29"/>
the said Practice: And that the said <HI>Factions</HI> and <HI>Parties</HI>
are greatly encouraged and fomented by the said Conjun∣ction
and Concurrence of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> with them:
That therefore Her Majesty thinks them unworthy any
further Protection; and recommends it to Her People to
think of some Methods to reduce them to a greater Sense
of their Duty, from which too much Liberty or the abuse
of that Liberty has encouraged them to decline.</P>
<P>It were to be wished the <HI>Dissenters</HI> would timely con∣sider
what would be the Consequence, if Her Majesty
should be provoked by their present Conduct to proceed
in such a manner: And whether it would be difficult to
move any Dutiful <HI>House of Commons</HI> so far to enter into
Her Majesty's just Resentments, as to take such Measures
to humble the <HI>Dissenters</HI> as Her Majesty should think
sufficient, and as would effectually take from them all
the Power they think they now have to animate and en∣courage
the <HI>Parties</HI> and <HI>Factions</HI> of the Government.</P>
<P>This is the friendly Advice designed by this <HI>Letter.</HI>
The <HI>Dissenters</HI> are not so Ignorant as not to know
what is their proper Duty in so nice a Juncture; and
that between Two Interests so full of Animosity, as it
appears our Parties have. It had been their wisest
Course at least to have appeared Neuter and Indiffe∣rent;
or else to have adhered to the Government whose
Protection they enjoy'd, till something else than mere
Party had given them cause to act otherwise; till they
had had just Cause to complain of Oppression, of Inju∣stice,
and of some Injuries which the Law might have
justified them by seeking Redress against. But while
this is their Case, and they have no such Complaint to
make, they are wholly inexcusable in their present Con∣duct:
And this is earnestly Recommended to them to
consider of.</P>
<P>It is easie to foresee, that a prejudiced <HI>Dissenter</HI> may
break forth in a warm Expostulation at this Advice, and
it may be in such Expressions as these: What would you
have the <HI>Dissenters</HI> do? What are they Guilty of? This
<PB N="30" REF="30"/>
is a Plot to draw them off from their Friends, and to di∣vide
them from the <HI>Low Church;</HI> The <HI>Dissenters</HI> and the
<HI>Low-Church</HI> are one in their Interest, and cannot be separated.
Who should the <HI>Dissenters</HI> joyn with? Can they be suppos∣ed
to joyn with <HI>Tories</HI> and <HI>Highflyers, Jacobites</HI> and <HI>New
Ministry?,</HI> That is impossible!</P>
<P>It may be reasonable to suppose, that this will be the
manner of Reply to the friendly Expostulations of this <HI>Let∣ter:</HI>
But all these Retorts shall be thrown aside in a few
Words. This <HI>Letter</HI> does not charge the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> or so
much as enquire, how far they are concerned or are not
concerned in the undutiful Conduct of those who are spo∣ken
of. The <HI>Dissenters</HI> may ask themselves the Question,
what they are Guilty of, and save those who wish them
well the unpleasant Office of Discriminating: Neither does
this <HI>Letter</HI> offer to divide them from, or engage them to
any Side or Party; and for that Reason was not published
(tho' long ago written) till all their Joining and Voting on
one Side or other, was finished and over. The <HI>Dissenters</HI>
know best whether there are any of the People here spoken
of, among them or no.</P>
<P>They are here only calmly advised not to embroil them∣selves
with their Sovereign and with her Administration,
for no Cause, and for they know not who. While the
Laws and those essential Branches of Government, Liber∣ty,
Property and Religion, are whole and untouched:
What can be of Moment sufficient for the <HI>Dissenters</HI>
to appear against the Government, if the Laws are not
broken?</P>
<P>If it be not true, that the <HI>Dissenters</HI> have too much
joined with abetted, countenanced and assisted the <HI>Faction</HI>
aforesaid in these Things, it is by so much their Advantage
and this Advice may be thought so far Needless: but if
they lay their Hands on their Hearts, they may see more
Cause for this Advice than they are willing to own.</P>
<P>Again, It may be offered in excuse of the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> that
although perhaps some hot Men among the <HI>Dissenters</HI> may
have been too forward, and may have shewn some Indiscre∣tion,
<PB N="31" REF="31"/>
yet that the whole Body of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> ought not
to suffer Blame on their Account.</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> The Advice is to the <HI>Guilty</HI> only, and it is
friendly and brief: That they would stop in time, and see
that they involve not the <HI>Innocent</HI> in the Ruin due to their
Folly; and to the <HI>Innocent</HI> the Advice is equally wholsome,
<HI>(viz.)</HI> To distinguish themselves, by such Methods as
they shall see reasonable, from those who are <HI>Guilty;</HI> that
it may be known there are some among the <HI>Dissenters,</HI>
who do not approve their Indiscretion, and that the Go∣vernment
may be moved not to resent it upon the whole
Body.</P>
