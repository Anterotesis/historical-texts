<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS there is nothing more Fantastical than
to Refine and Sublimate Honour, such
an airy Nicety, that the least Puff of
inconsiderate Breath can either blow
or blast it; so nothing can be more Degenerous in
reasonable Man, the visible Image of his Maker,
and Prince of Sublunary Creatures, than in a Beast∣ly
manner to Gore, Kill, and Destroy his Fellow-Creature,
for a Thing that hath no Subsistence,
but in the vain Imagination of a Whimsical Mind;
and no kind of Countenance in those Parts of the
World where Civility and Religion have been
Cultivated. Nevertheless, during the League and
Civil Wars of <HI>France,</HI> the over-weaning Heat of
that People, brought in vogue amongst themselves,
and by a pernicious Contagion propagated amongst
<PB REF="3"/>
their Neighbours, who were silly enough to ape
them, the Inhuman and Barbarous Practice of
Fighting and Murdering one another in cold Blood,
for the least Ruffle of a Chimerical Point of Ho∣nour,
which, in Reason, ought to be manfully slight∣ed,
rather than meanly resented, since real Injuries
are sufficiently provided against by Laws. And this
Horrid Custom growing so common, that scarcely
was he looked upon as a Gentleman of Honour,
but he that had Killed or Fought his Man. The
Inconveniencies thereof were so many, and so de∣plorable,
and yet so hard to be remedied, that
for many Years, and during several Princes Reigns,
no one Thing more employed the Cares of the Go∣vernment,
both Civil and Ecclesiastical, than the
Rooting out of this Unchristian and Inhuman Cu∣stom,
and that very early, as appears by that Ex∣cellent
Edict of King <HI>Pharemond</HI>'s, in the Year
440, which we shall here insert.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Pharamond's Edict against DUELS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Pharamond, King of the Gauls, to all his Loving
Subjects sendeth Greeting.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas it has come to our Royal Notice and
Observation, that in Contempt of all Laws,
Divine and Human, it is of late become a Custom
among the Nobility and Gentry of this our Kingdom,
upon slight and trivial, as well as great and urgent,
Provocations, to invite each other into the Field,
there by their own Hands, and of their own Autho∣rity,
to decide their Controversies by Combat, we
have thought fit to take the said Custom into our
Royal Consideration, and find, upon Enquiry into
the usual Causes whereon such Fatal Decisions have
<PB REF="4"/>
arisen, that by this wicked C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stom, maugre all the
Precepts of our Holy Religion, and the Rules of
Right Reason, the greatest Act of the Human Mind,
<HI>Forgiveness of Injuries,</HI> is become vile and shameful;
that the Rules of Good Society and Virtueus Con∣versation
are hereby inverted; that the Loose, the
Vain, and the Impudent, insult the Careful, the
Discreet, and the Modest; that all Virtue is sup∣press'd,
and all Vice supported, in the one Act of
being capable to dare to the Death. We have also
farther, with great Sorrow of Mind, observ'd that
this dreadful Action, by long Impunity, (our Royal At∣tention
being employed upon Matters of more general
Concern,) is become Honourable, and the Refusal to
engage in it Ignominious. In these our Royal Cares
and Enquiries we are yet farther made to understand,
that the Persons of most Eminent Worth, and most
Hopeful Abilities, accompanied with the strongest
Passion for true Glory, are such as are most liable to
be involved in the Dangers arising from this Licence.
Now taking the said Premises into our serious Con∣sideration,
and well weighing that all such Emer∣gencies,
(wherein the Mind is incapable of com∣manding
itself, and where the Injury is too sudden
or too exquisite to be borne,) are particularly pro∣vided
for by Laws heretosore enacted; and that the
Qualities of less Injuries, like those of Ingratitude,
are too Nice and Delicate to come under General
Rules. We do resolve to blot this Fashion, or Wan∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onness
of Anger, out of the Minds of our Subjects,
by our Royal Resolutions declar'd in this Edict, as
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ollow.</P>
<P>No Person, who either Sends or Accepts a Chal∣lenge,
or the Posterity of either, tho' no Death en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ues
thereupon, shall be, after the Publication of
<PB REF="5"/>
this our Edict, capable of bearing Office in these
our Dominions.</P>
<P>The Person who shall prove the Sending or Re∣ceiving
a Challenge, shall receive, to his own Use
and Property, the whole Personal Estate of both
Parties; and their Real Estate shall be immediately
vested in the next Heir of the Offenders, in as
Ample Manner as if the said Offenders were actual∣ly
Deceased.</P>
<P>In Cases where the Laws (which we have already
granted to our Subjects) admit of an Appeal for
Blood, when the Criminal is condemned by the said
Appeal, he shall not only suffer Death, but his
whole Estate, Real, Mixed and Personal, shall
from the Hour of his Death be vested in the next
Heir of the Person whose Blood he spilt.</P>
<P>That it shall not hereafter be in our Royal Power,
or that of our Successors, to pardon the said Offences,
or restore the Offenders in their Estates, Honour,
or Blood, for ever.</P>
<CLOSER>Given at our Court at <HI>Blois</HI> the
8th of <HI>February,</HI> 420, in the
Second Year of our Reign.</CLOSER>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>Indeed, he who will take the Pains to peruse the
many reiterated Edicts, Declarations and Decrees,
of the Kings and Parliaments of <HI>France,</HI> that are
to be found in the Collection of them, and consi∣der
how Pathetically they are Worded, must needs
confess that that Government had hard Struglings
to make the Honour of the <HI>French</HI> Gentry sleep in
a whole Skin; and that the Supream Authority
of that Nation was never more audaciously slight∣ed,
than in the Particular of Duels.</P>
<P><PB REF="6"/>
The Design then of the following Book is to
shew the <HI>English</HI> Reader what Care the Govern∣ment
of <HI>France,</HI> justly offended at so intolerable a
Custom, took to Repress it; what Laws were
Made, and strictly put in Execution, against it; and
by Consequent, to Convince him how Necessary
the same Course would be in this Nation where
the same offensive Weed hath taken such deep
Rooting: But because the Compiler thereof hath
thought it sufficient to Translate only some Acts
and Ordinances of the present <HI>French</HI> King's Reign,
as Virtually and Eminently comprehending all the
former Laws made against Duelling, for the Sa∣tisfaction
of the Reader it hath been judged Per∣tinent
to Premise, by Way of Preface, a short Ab∣stract,
and the Dates of the chief Edicts and De∣crees
made for the same Effect, in the Reigns of
his Father and Grandfather, that in the Series of
the Remedies he may observe the Progress and
Continuance of the Evil, which is now at length
much Abated, if not wholly Cured.</P>
<P>In order, therefore, to the Suppression of Duels,
the Parliament of <HI>Paris, June</HI> 26. 1599, De∣clares
all those who Revenge themselves of Inju∣ries
and Affronts by any other Way than the or∣dinary
Course of Law, guilty of High Treason;
ordering the Estates, as well Personal as Real, both
of the Living and Dead, who have so Offended,
Confiscated to the King; and all who have any
way Assisted, or been present at Duels, or Meet∣ings
held for such Unlawful Prosecution of Quar∣rels,
Rebels to his Majesty, Transgressors of the
Law, and Disturbers of the Publick Peace. In Con∣sequence
whereof, <HI>Henry</HI> IV. by his Edict at <HI>Blois</HI>
of <HI>April</HI> 1602, mentioning, That the Disorders of
that Abominable Custom of Fighting Duels for Re∣paration
<PB REF="7"/>
of Honour were so great, and so much
Christian Blood spilt thereby, that he could not
judge himself worrhy of Swaying the Scepter if he
did not put a Stop to that Abuse, Declares in Con∣formity
to the former Decree of Parliament, all
who have Fought Duels, whether they be Dead or
Alive, Guilty of Treason; and Orders their Persons
and Estates to be accordingly proceeded against,
with Power and Injunction to the Constable and
Marshals of <HI>France,</HI> the Governours and Lieutenant.
Generals of Provinces, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to give such Reparation
to the Parties injured in Honour, as may both pre∣vent
the Unlawful Effusion of Blood, and save the
Reputation of Gentlemen: To which, as all His
Majesty's Subjects were to render punctual Obedi∣ence,
so the Punishment against the Disobedient
and Transgressois were no ways to be Remitted
nor Moderated.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the Severity of all preceding
Edicts, so possessed were the <HI>French</HI> with the False
Opinion, that their Injured Honour could not be
Repaired but by the Unlawful Way of Duelling,
that the same King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. in his Edict at
<HI>Fountaine Blean</HI> of <HI>June</HI> 1609, Regretting that
the Rigour of the Law did rather Exasperate than
Repress that Insolent and Brutish Custom, confirms
and enlarges his former Edict, and besides the Pe∣nalties
above imposed, Ordains Punishments for
all that any way are concerned in Duelling, not
only the Principals, Seconds, and Carriers of Chal∣lenges,
or Offensive and Provoking Words, but for
such as come to the Place assigned as Spectators,
without Intention of Fighting; nay, and for those
also, who, coming accidentally, do not endeavour
to prevent the Effusion of Blood; and that by Death,
Confiscation of Goods, Loss or Suspension of Pla∣ces,
<PB REF="8"/>
Fines, Imprisonment, Degradation from Ho∣nour
and Infamy, according to the Share and Con∣cern
they have had in the Quarrels; Dedicating
to the Poor, Pious and Religious Uses, all the Con∣fiscated
Estates and Fines that fell to the Crown
by such Misdemeanours, and Declaring and Pro∣testing
before God, That he will never Pardon any,
who shall be found Guilty of the Violation of that
Edict; and Prohibiting the Queen, Princes of the
Blood, and all Courtiers whosoever, to intercede
for them, upon Pain of his Displeasure. However,
that he might in some Measure comply with a Per∣nicious
Humour, that seemed Incorporated into the
Temper of the <HI>French</HI> Nobility and Gentry, he gives
leave to those who should imagine themselves In∣jured
and Affronted beyond the Satisfaction that
might be granted them by the ordinary Course of
Law, to make their Application to himself, or to
the Constable, Marshals of <HI>France,</HI> Governours of
Provinces, Lieutenant Generals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and according
to the Nature of the Affront he Promises to allow
them the Combat, if no other Satisfaction can be
sufficient.</P>
<P>The strict Execution of these Laws having, du∣ring
the rest of the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. put some
Stop to the Insolent and Bold Way of Fighting upon
Challenges, in the beginning of the Reign of <HI>Louis</HI>
XIII. to Elude the Force of the former Edicts, a
new Way of Fighting was Introduced, as upon ac∣cidental
Rencounters, pretending no Challenge to
have preceded. This gave Occasion to the said
King by his Declaration at <HI>Paris</HI> of the first of
<HI>July</HI> 1611, not only to Revive and Confirm the
former Edicts of his Father, but also to extend
the Force of the same to Rencounters, if it could
be made out that any Quarrel, by Word or Deed,
<PB REF="9"/>
past before betwixt Parties so engaging: Which he
afterward Confirmed and Enlarged by his Declarati∣on
at <HI>Paris</HI> of the 18th of <HI>January</HI> 1613, wherein
to cut off all Hopes of Impunity from those who
should fall into such Offences, having enjoined a
strict and rigorous Execution of all former Edicts,
he Declares, That whosoever shall dare to make
Application to Him, or to his Mother, the Queen
Regent, to Mediate and Intercede for Pardons for
such Offenders, shall Incur his Indignation; and
that whosoever shall Conceal or Entertain such
Criminals, and not Inform against them, shall be
Reputed and Punished as Accessary to the Crimes;
declaring also, that if Parties Offended in Honour
do not within a Month after the Injury or Affront
received, make their Complaints to the Constables,
Marshals, and the other Judges of Honour appointed
by the aforementioned Edicts, they shall not be
heard for any Reparation by them, but must take
their Course at Common Law. And the Parliament
of <HI>Paris,</HI> at the Motion of the King's Attorney-General,
upon Occasion of frequent Duelings in the
Streets of that City, on the 27th of <HI>January,</HI> 1614,
Ratified the same Declaration, commanding the
Punctual Execution of the same, by the Officers of
Civil Justice, and exhorting all Bishops and Pre∣lates,
according to the Edicts, to deny Christian
Burial to those that should be Killed in such Ren∣counters.</P>
<P>No sooner was the same <HI>Louis</HI> XIII. of Age,
but upon Complaint made to him, that amongst
other Abuses, that of Duelling and Fighting upon
Rencounters was still obstinately practised, not∣withstanding
the Severity of the Laws, he issued
out a Declaration of the First of <HI>October,</HI> 1614,
which the Day following he himself sitting on
<PB REF="10"/>
his Throne in Parliament, was there ratified,
whereby he confirmed all former Laws made a∣gainst
that Crime, enjoined a strict Prosecution
of the Guilty, and solemnly promised not to Par∣don
such Offenders, upon any Intercession, Account
or Pretext, whatsoever. All this nevertheless was
not sussicient to cool the <HI>French</HI> Blood, for Duel∣ling
still continued; so that <HI>July</HI> 14, 1617, the
King published another Edict verified in Parliament,
wherein after a Christian Preamble concerning the
Horridness of that Detestable Crime, he not only
revives all former Laws made against it, and solemn∣ly
Swears never to Pardon any of what Quality
soever that shall be guilty of the same, but also
enjoins all Judges and Courts of Justice not to have
Respect to any such Pardons or Remissions present∣ed
to them, as being contrary to his Majesty's
Will and Pleasure, and appoints Part of the Estates
Confiscated for these Crimes to be given to In∣formers,
to encourage them to prosecute the same;
the rest, as before, being allotted for Pious Uses.
And this Edict was in <HI>March,</HI> 1621, put rigorously
in Execution by the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> who Con∣demned
Five Persons Guilty of that Crime of
High Treason, Adjudged their Estates Forseited,
and themselves to be Hanged in Person, if Appre∣hended;
and if not, in Effigie, in the Publick Place
of Execution in <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>By another Edict of <HI>August,</HI> 1623, published in
Parliament the 29th of the same Month, besides the
Confirmation of all former Edicts concerning Duels,
it is ordered, That whatever Person, whether Gentle∣man,
Servant or Lackey, shall carry a Challenge,
by Word or Writing, shall without Mercy be put
to Death. In pursuance of which, and all the
former Edicts, <HI>April</HI> 24, 1624, the Parliament
<PB REF="11"/>
of <HI>Paris</HI> condemned <HI>Bouteville,</HI> Count of <HI>Pontgi∣bault,</HI>
the Baron of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>antail</HI> and <HI>des Salles,</HI> for
having fought a Duel on <HI>Easter</HI>-Day, of High
Treason, and sentenced them to be degraded from
all Priviledges of Honour, and declared Ignoble
and Infamous, themselves Hanged on a Gibbet in
the Place of Execution in <HI>Paris,</HI> and their Dead
Bodies carried to <HI>Montfaulcon,</HI> if apprehended;
and if not, Hanged in Effigie upon a Gallows in
the same Place; all their Houses razed and de∣molished,
never again to be rebuilt, and the Trees
growing about them lopt off by the Middle, to
remain as a perpetual Monument of their Crime;
a Pillar of Free-stone, with an Inscription in a
Copper-Plate be erected in the Places, containing
the Causes of that Demolition, and their Estates
Personal and Real Confiscated. And that this
Sentence might the more effectually be put in
Execution, his Majesty by bis Edict of the 24th of
<HI>June,</HI> 1624, prohibits all Princes, Lords, and
Gentlemen, of what Quality soever, to favour, assist,
or entertain, the Violaters of his Edicts in the Mat∣ter
of Duels, and all Vicars and Curats to give
them Christial Burial: According to which it
was Decreed in Parliament upon Occasion of ano∣ther
Duel Fought by the same <HI>Bouteville,</HI> and others,
the 28th of <HI>January,</HI> 1625, that all who did har∣bour,
receive or assist, them with Lodging, Victuals,
or any Thing else should be reckoned guilty of
High Treason.</P>
<P>Duelling nevertheless was still so Universal∣ly
practised, and so many Persons of all Qualities
were thereby Obnoxious to the Laws, that upon
the Marriage of the Queen of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> Grand-Mother
to her present Majesty of <HI>England,</HI> and Sister
to the same <HI>Louis</HI> XIII. of <HI>France,</HI> when that
<PB REF="12"/>
Prince was to grant his Subjects some Publick Act
of Grace, as a Testimony of his own, and an En∣couragement
to their Joy, upon so Solemn an Oc∣casion,
nothing could be thought of, more accept∣able
to the Publick, nor more conducive to the End
proposed, than a General Pardon for past Duels,
which by his Edict at <HI>Paris</HI> of <HI>February,</HI> 1626,
he graciously granted: But at the same Time, to
prevent that Scandalous Abuse for the future, which
he had till then endeavoured by all Means, but Un∣successfully,
to Remedy, he adds to all former Edicts,
New Punishments, not to be dispensed with at
the Sollicitation of any Person, nor upon any Ac∣count
whatsoever, as being less Rigorous than those
formerly imposed: And these consisted chiefly for
those who should give or receive a Challenge,
without Slaughter committed (the Severity of all
former Edicts being reinforced against such as Kil∣led)
in Banishment for a certain Term of Years,
Loss of all Places and Pensions that they held of his
Majesty, which were to be conferred upon others;
a Third Part of their Estates, and Death, if they
offered to Challenge those who should be pro∣vided
to their Offices and Pensions: And that a
Pretext of Accidental Rencounters might not serve
for an Excuse to those who premeditately Fought,
nor by withdrawing out of the Countrey, or to the
Frontiers, upon such Designs, any might elude the
Force of the Law, it was Ordered by that Edict,
that in Rencounters the Aggressor should be Repu∣ted
and Punished as a Challenger, if he could be
known; and if it were doubtful who was the Ag∣gressor,
both Parties should suffer as such: That
those who Fought out of the Countrey, or upon the
Borders, and made their Escape thither, should be
Proceeded against as if the Fact were Committed
<PB REF="13"/>
in <HI>France;</HI> and that it should be Death and perpe∣tual
Infamy to Employ Seconds, as being a Sign of
Cowardice, and Honourable to refuse a Challenge,
or being a Second, as being a Mark of True Va∣lour;
his Majesty promising to Honour with his
Esteem, and Employ in his Service, both Civil and
Militrary, all who by so doing pay'd Obedience to
his Edicts; and, Ordering, as in former Edicts,
the Marshals of <HI>France,</HI> and other Judges of Ho∣nour,
to Command such Reparations of Honour
to be made to the Obedient as might entirely se∣cure
their Reputation; for the more punctual Per∣formance
whereof his Majesty interposes his Au∣thority,
Swearing before God never to grant any
Remissions for the afore-mentioned Crimes, and
enjoining his Judges to give no Respect to any such
Pardons, if presented to them, as being surrepti∣tiously
obtained from him. And his Majesty, to
shew his firm Resolution to see his Edict punctu∣ally
put in Execution, sometime after, upon a bare
Supposition, that the Sieur of <HI>Liancourt</HI> had chal∣lenged
the Sieur <HI>Cressias,</HI> upon some Dispute that
had happened betwixt the Duke of <HI>Halluin</HI> and the
said <HI>Cressias,</HI> banished them all his Court, and de∣prived
<HI>Liancourt</HI> of his Place of First Gentleman of
his Bed-chamber; but it appearing afterward to be
a false Surmis, they were recalled, and <HI>Liancourt</HI>
restored to his Place.</P>
<P>In Pursuance of the above-mentioned Edicts, <HI>Bou∣teville</HI>
and <HI>des Chapelles</HI> being apprehended, and in
Prison for another Duel, were with their Accom∣plices,
by a Decree of the Parliament of <HI>Paris,
June</HI> 21, 1627, Condemned of High Treason, and
Sentenced to be Beheaded, and their Estates Con∣fiscated
to the King. The Severity of the Edicts
nevertheless, and the Exemplary Execution of them,
<PB REF="14"/>
could not so restrain the Impetuosity of the <HI>French</HI>
Fire, but that the Pernicious Custom of Duelling
still continued; insomuch that the same King by
his Declaration of the 29th of <HI>May,</HI> 1634, com∣manded
all the former Edicts against Duels to be
Published of new; solemnly Swearing to grant
no Pardon for such Crimes, declaring those who
should intercede for such Offenders, Enemies of his
Reputation, and Unworthy of his Favour; pro∣hibiting
all, of what Quality soever, to Harbour or
Assist such Delinquents, upon Pain of being Ba∣nished
the Court for a Year, and their Houses
razed, and causing his Secretaries and Keeper of
the Great Seal to be Sworn not to Sign, or put the
the Seal to any Pardon for Duelling, though there∣to
expresly required on his Part. And the Parlia∣ment
of <HI>Paris</HI> in the Year 1635 declared the last
Will and Testament of a Person of Great Quality
who had fought a Duel, to be Null, as having For∣feited
his Right of Testating by that Crime. The
same Parliament also in the Years 1638 and 1639,
upon Complaints made to that Court of the Con∣tinued
Abuse of Duelling, by the King's Attorney-General,
and in Obedience to a Letter from the
King, in the Year 1640, who in Consideration of
the Birth of the <HI>Dauphin,</HI> the present King of
<HI>France,</HI> had given a General Pardon for all prece∣ding
Duels, made several Decrees for Publishing
of new, and putting in strict Execution all Laws
and Edicts made against that Barbarous and Brutish
Crime.</P>
<P>And in this State was the Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> in
relation to Duelling, when the present King <HI>Louis</HI>
XIV, being but a Child, came to the Crown, and
a long Edict, with a most Christian and Elaborate
Preface to it, against that Crime in the Year 1643,
<PB REF="15"/>
when he entered into the Government. This For∣tunate
Prince hath been more successful in this, as
in many other great Attempts, than any of his Pre∣decessors;
and by a strict Execution of the Laws,
and the Use of his Sovereign Authority, hath
taught his Subjects another Way of Aspiring to Ho∣nonour,
than by Killing one another for Punctilio's
and Trifles, having by the Methods mentioned in
the following Book reduced <HI>France</HI> to a Submissive
Obedience of the Laws at this Time, most worthy
the Imitation of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> where this Inhu∣man
Practice does so much prevail. But since
this has been Graciously Recommended from the
Throne, it is to be hoped that the Parliament will
find out some speedy and effectual Method to pre∣vent
it; to which end it has been thought season∣able
to Publish this <HI>Account of the Abolishing of
Duels in</HI> France.</P>

<HEAD>AN
ACCOUNT
Of the Abolishing of
Duels in France.</HEAD>
<P>MANY Edicts, Declarations, and Decrees,
were set forth by the Kings and Parlia∣ments
in <HI>France,</HI> during the Reigns of
<HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, and <HI>Lewis</HI> the Thir∣teenth,
the present King's Father and Grandfather,
for Suppressing <HI>Duels</HI> and <HI>Rencounters,</HI> and other
Means were us'd by them for the same Effect, but
without Success. <HI>Lewis</HI> the Fourteenth, the present
King, at the Entrance of his Reign, made a long E∣dict
against those Crimes in the Year 1643, and on
the Eleventh of <HI>May,</HI> 1644, set forth a Declaration,
which was confirm'd in Parliament the Ninth of
<HI>June</HI> following, whereby reiterated Prohibitions were
made to all Persons against Challenging each other,
Fighting Duels, Rencounters, or otherwise; and a∣gainst
Contravening to the Edicts and Declarations
of his Majesty, under the Pains provided by the Or∣dinances.</P>
<P>On
the Thirteenth of <HI>March,</HI> 1646, he set forth
another Declaration, Prohibiting <HI>Quarrels, Duels,
Challenges,</HI> and <HI>Rencounters;</HI> this being a Confirmati∣on
and Augmentation of the Penalties contain'd in
the Edicts, Declarations and Decrees, formerly made
<PB N="2" REF="17"/>
on the said Subject, which Declaration was also Pub∣lished
in Parliament the Twentieth of <HI>March,</HI> in the
same Year.</P>
<P>In the Year 1651, in the Month of <HI>September,</HI> upon
the King's being Declar'd Major, and he being well
possest of what Importance it was to the State to
have these <HI>Duels</HI> and <HI>Rencounters</HI> Abolisht, he set
forth a more Ample and Peremptory Edict against
them, than any had been in the Reigus of his Father
or Grandfather, it consisting of Twenty-four Articles;
which Edict was also confirmed in Parliament, the
King being present, in the same Month and Year;
and he took a firm Resolution to have the Penalties
therein contain'd effectually put in Execution against
all such as should Contravene. <HI>I shall not give it you
here, by Reason of a more Comprehensive Edict which you
will find in the Sequel.</HI></P>
<P>In the Month of <HI>May,</HI> 1653, the King set forth
another Declaration against <HI>Duels,</HI> it being an En∣largement
and Explanation of some Points in the
foregoing Edict; in the latter Part of which it is said
thus: And for asmuch as the Fifth Article concern∣ing
the Satisfactions which ought to be appointed by
Our Cosins the Marshals of <HI>France,</HI> for Persons offend∣ed
in Honour seems to be coucht in Two General
Terms, and that the express Protestation made a long
Time before Our last Edict, and the Engagement in
Writing of many Gentlemen of Quality of our King∣dom,
of not receiving for the Time to come any Chal∣lenge,
requires that there be a full and advantageous
Provision for the Reparation of Offences, which may
be made to their Reputation, and to the Reputation
of those who shall abstain for the future from taking
Satisfaction of themselves, and who shall have Re∣course
to such as we have Establish'd for rendring
them Justice, it is our Will and Pleasure, That our
Cosins, the Marshals of <HI>France,</HI> shall meet forthwith,
to prepare a Rule as exact and clear as may be con∣cerning
the divers Satisfactions and Reparations of
Honour, that they shall judge ought to be ordain'd
according to the divers Degrees of Offences; which
Rule shall be inviolably stood to for the future by
<PB N="3" REF="18"/>
all those who shall be employ'd in the Accommoda∣tions
of Differences, which shall concern Point of Ho∣nour,
and the Reputation of Gentlemen. This De∣claration
was confirm'd in Parliament the Twenty∣ninth
of <HI>July,</HI> in the same Year.</P>
<P>On the Thirtieth of <HI>July,</HI> 1657, there was a De∣cree
of the Court of Parliament, importing a Reitera∣tion
of Prohibitions of Duels, and enjoining Officers
to be very attentive in discovering Crimes of Duels
wherein they had been found Negligent.</P>
<P>Now many Gentlemen of Quality in <HI>France,</HI> before
the Year 1651, (as it is before intimated,) had made
a Publick Declaration and Solemn Protestation un∣der
their Hands to refuse all kinds of Challenges,
and never to Fight a Duel on any Account whatsoe∣ver.
It was Worded in these Terms:</P>
<P>The Subsign'd, by the Present Writing, make a
Publick Declaration and Solemn Protestation of refu∣sing
all kinds of Challenges, and of not Fighting a
Duel on any Occasion whatsoever, and of rendring
all kind of Testimony of the Detestation they have of
Duels, as a Thing wholly contrary to Reason, to the
Welfare and the Laws of the State, and inconsistent
with Salvation and Christian Religion; though with∣out
renouncing the Right of repelling by all Lawful
Ways any Injuries that shall be offered them, accord∣ing
as their Profession and Birth shall oblige them to
it, being also always ready on their Parts to give
with Sincerity a right Understanding to those who
shall conceive themselves to have some Cause of a
Resentment against them, and resolving not to give
Occasion to any Man.</P>
<P>The Marshals of <HI>France</HI> being made acquainted and
presented with this Declaration by the Gentlemen
who Subsign'd it, and being desired their Sense of it,
gave the following Judgment thereon.</P>
<P>Forasmuch as many Gentlemen, very well known
as well by the Illustrious Marks of their Houses, as
by those they have given of their Courage on divers
Occasions, have represented to us that they passio∣nately
Wish to contribute all shall lye in them for the
Execution of the King's Edicts against the pernicious
<PB N="4" REF="19"/>
Use of Duels, introduc'd, and grown inveterate in
<HI>France,</HI> to the great Prejudice of Christian Religion,
and of the Welfare of the State; that for this End
they had Subsign'd a Writing containing a Publick
Declaration and Solemn Protestation of refusing all
kinds of Challenges, and of never Fighting a Duel on
any Cause whatsoever, and of rendring all kind of
Testimony of the Detestation they have of Duels, as
a Thing wholly contrary to Reason, to the Welfare
and Laws of the State, and inconsistent with Salvati∣on,
and the Christian Religion: Though without
renouncing the Right of Repelling by all Lawful
Ways Injuries that shall be offered them, as much as
their Profession and Birth obliges them to it: Being
also alway ready on their Parts to give with Sincerity
a right Understanding to those who shall conceive
themselves to have some Cause of a Resentment a∣gainst
them, and resolving not to give Occasion to
any Man: We having seen and examin'd the said
Writing, and after having heard them on this Mat∣ter,
have approv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, and do approve of what is con∣tain'd
in the said Writing, declare it conformable to
the King's Edicts, and to the Laws of Honour, as it
is to those of the true Religion: And we exhort all
the Gentlemen of this Kingdom to Subscribe to it,
and to observe it in all its Points; as also those who
have Subsign'd to that Writing, and all those that
will Subsign it, and remedy the Disorder of Duels,
to confer and advise together concerning the Satisfacti∣ons
they shall conceive may reasonably pass in lieu of
those which are hoped for by Duels; to prepare Me∣moirs
of them, and put them forthwith into the
Hands of our Secretary of the Marshalsea of <HI>France;</HI>
to the End that having Read and Examin'd them,
we may make a Report of them to his Majesty to be
confirm'd if he shall think fit, by a New Edict or
Declaration, to the Good of Religion, and the Wel∣fare
of his State, <HI>Paris</HI> the First of <HI>July,</HI> 1651. Sign'd
by the Marshals of <HI>France,</HI> and beneath</P>

<HEAD>The Resolution of the Prelates on this Matter.</HEAD>
<P>WE, desiring to discharge the Obligation which
the Holy Ghost has laid on us of governing
the Church of God, to provide Charitably for the
Necessities of our Neighbour, and to procure the Sal∣vation
of Souls as much as it shall be possible for us,
after having seen the Declaration made by many Gen∣tlemen
of Refusing all Sorts of Challenges, and never
to Fight a Duel on any Cause whatsoever, and after∣ward
the Judgment given by the <HI>Marshals</HI> of <HI>France</HI>
on the said Declaration, have judg'd it proper to ap∣prove
the Generous and Christian Conduct of both
concerning the said Declaration and Judgment, and to
fulminate withal new Anathema's against the Insolence
and Barbarousness of Duels; Nature has them in
Horrour, Reason condemns them, and the Civil and
Ecclesiastical Laws detest these Black Furies, and Hea∣ven
is arm'd with its most rigorous Vengeance to Punish
such Monstrous Crimes.</P>
<P>They are these cruel Excesses which bring at the same
time a Dishonour on the Laws, a Reproach on Hu∣mane
Nature, an Injury on Religion, a Shame on Chri∣stianity,
and cause a Weakening in the State, the
Scandal of the People, the Anger of Heaven, and the
Loss of Souls.</P>
<P>Is is not to extinguish the Sentiments of Huma∣nity,
and to divest us of the Light of Reason, for a
Man to go about to destroy his Like, and to expose
himself to the Danger of being lost, by giving way to
a brutish Passion, which seems to imitate the fury of
Tygers; or to establish a Point of Imaginary Honour,
which promotes a bloody and cruel Doctrine of Man∣slaughter;
which gives Rules for Murther, and which
disguises Assassination in a Method and Measure, to se∣duce
very often the most dastardly Spirits, and the
weakest Courages.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="21"/>
The Decree of Pope <HI>Steven</HI> prohibits the ill Custom
of proving a Man's Innocency by boiling Water, and
by a burning hot Iron; and St. <HI>Thomas</HI> judges very per∣tinently,
that at the same time he condemns <HI>Duels.</HI> In
reality, what colour is there for committing to the
Chance of Arms a Man's Reputation, his Life, his E∣ternity,
since it happens even very often by a just Judg∣ment
of God, that the most skilful, and the least ti∣merous,
falls under the Hand of the weakest.</P>
<P>Let Princes therefore and Magistrates arm their Au∣thority
with a new Vigour to mark with Infamy these
Gladiators, who seem in contempt of Christianity to
go about to revive Paganism and Idolatry. It may be
said that we breathe yet the Contagious Breath of those
Unfortunate Ages, in which Men sacrificed to Idols the
Blood and Life of Mankind. O Princes! O Judges!
O Grandees of the Earth! who are the Umpires of
the Fortune of Men, if by the Civil Laws you ought
to see that the Poor be relieved with Food, which is
necessary for them, what account will you have to
give before God, if you do not labour, as you may,
to dry up the Sources of Blood, which in the Lan∣guage
of the Scripture are those of all Crimes?</P>
<P>The use of Blood was expresly forbidden among
the <HI>Hebrews</HI> for Two chief Reasons; First, to abolish
Idolatry; And Secondly, to condemn Cruelty. God
alone ought to be the Master of the Life of Men, and
the Blood <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Animals was retain'd in the Sacrifices for
an Acknowledgment of the Sovereign Dominion of
God, and to red<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m the Life of sinful Men by the effu∣sion
of the Blood of the Offerings: But in the Law of
the Gospel the Prophet <HI>Isarab</HI> foretold us, That
Fights, Wars, and Slaughter, should cease, in the Peace
of the Church, and under the Empire of the <HI>Messias.</HI>
who is the true pacifick <HI>Solomon;</HI> this Blood ought not
to be spilt but for the Glory of God, and the Support
of the Throne, for increasing the Crowns of Religion,
and that of the State, for the Promotion of Faith, and
for the Interests of our lawful Monarch; this Blood,
which the Insolence of the Duelists, and the Silence of
the Judges, unworthily sheds, requires another Ven∣geance,
which must give a Terror to those who have
<PB N="7" REF="22"/>
any Sense of the Fear of God. The Voice of the Blood
which is spilt on the Earth carries its Cry even to
Heaven, and more yet the Voice of the Blood of the
Son of God, which cries far beyond that of <HI>Abel;</HI> as
St. <HI>Gregory</HI> explains it.</P>
<P>If then the Spectacle of a dying God makes an Im∣pression
on our Hearts, and if the Image of his cruel
Martyrdom is not blotted out of our Memories; let
us for ever condemn Duels, having in horror these de∣testable
Practices, which cause a Precious Blood to be
sacrificed to Devils, that ought to be manag'd for the
Service of a God, who through an Excess of Love not
to be equall'd, was Prodigal of his own to extinguish
our Crimes and Ingratitudes: And at the same time
let us raise our Hands to Heaven, to draw down the
Blessings of God on this Illustirous Nobility, which
has so Christianly renounced those false Maxims, to
imbrace with a perfect Religion those of the Gospel.
Assure yourselves, Gentlemen, that the laudable Re∣putation
which you have acquir'd, worthy of the
Greatness of your Courages, shall lose nothing of its
Lustre by a Writing so generous, as that you have
sign'd for renouncing of <HI>Duels.</HI> Your Honour is in
the Hands of God, who will be a faithful Depository,
since you are faithful to the Interests of his Glory. We
hope that our Great King, whose Admirable Qualities
have from his first Infancy fill'd all Men with Admi∣ration,
is now upon Consecrating the first Years of his
Majority, and giving a new Lustre to his Crown by
the Esteem which he shall make your Vertues. We
are assur'd that God will bless his Arms and Councils,
when he shall make use of such Persons as you in
giving them honourable Employs; the Capacity of the
Ministers of Kings is always great enough when Pro∣bity
is found in them; the main Point in Councils,
and the Privy Closet, is Fidelity; and those are al∣way
faithful to their Princes, who are faithful to
God.</P>
<P>This is the Approbation which we are oblig'd to
give to your Conduct: This is the Publick Testimony
of the Esteem and Respect we have for the Judgment
given by the Marshals of <HI>France.</HI> These are the Vows
<PB N="8" REF="23"/>
and Wishes which we shall continue to offer on the
Altars, to obtain an Immortal Glory for all those who
labour to turn aside the Scourges of God, which
threaten us, unless we powerfully labour to abolish
Crimes, and to hinder <HI>Duels.</HI></P>

<P>The Gentlemen who had Subsign'd to the fore-men∣tioned
Declaration and Protestation against Duels, ha∣ving
given in their Thoughts as above directed con∣cerning
Satisfactions, the Marshals of <HI>France</HI> proceed∣ed
to an Ordinance concerning the Reparations of Of∣fences
<PB N="9" REF="24"/>
betwixt Gentlemen, for the Execution of the
Edict against Duels. Their Ordinance is as follows.</P>
<P>FOrasmuch as it has been injoin'd us by an express
Order from the King, and particularly by the De∣claration
of his Majesty against <HI>Duels,</HI> Read, Publish'd,
and Registred in the Parliament of <HI>Paris</HI> the 29th of
<HI>July</HI> last past, <HI>to meet together forthwith for preparing a
Rule, the most exact and clear that might be, concerning
the divers Satisfactions and Reparations of Honour, which
we shall judge ought to be Ordam'd, according to the seve∣ral
Degrees of Offences; and after such a manner, that the
Punishment against the Aggressor, and the Satisfactions to
the Party offended, be so great and so proportion'd to the
Injury receiv'd, that no Complaint or new Quarrel can break
forth afresh; the said Rule being to be inviolably follow'd
and observ'd for the time to come by all those who shall
be employ'd in the Accommodations of the Differences which
shall concern Point of Honour, and the Reputation of Gen∣tlemen:</HI>
We after having seen and examin'd the Pro∣positions
of many Gentlemen of Quality of this King∣dom,
who have had divers Conferences together on
this Subject, consequentially to the Order which was
given them by us on the First of <HI>July,</HI> 1651, and who
presented us in our Meeting the said Propositions put
in Writing, and Sign'd by their Hands, have after a
mature Deliberation concluded and resolv'd of the
following Articles.</P>
<P>I. That in all the Occasions and Subjects which may
cause Quarrels and Resentments, no Gentleman ought
to esteem contrary to Honour whatsoever may give a
full and sincere Explanation of the Truth.</P>
<P>II. That among Gentlemen many having already
protested Solemnly, and in Writing, to refuse all Sorts
of Challenges, and not to Fight a Duel on any Cause
whatsoever: These are by so much the more oblig'd
to give those clear Explanations, that without it they
will formally act contrary to what they have written,
and shall consequently be more worthy Reprehension
and Chastisement in the Accommodations of the Quar∣rels
which shall happen for want of a clear Under∣standing.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="25"/>
III. That if a Person pretending to be offended has
so little Reason, as not to rest satisfy'd with a clear Un∣derstanding,
which has been sincerely given him, and
that he will oblige the Person by whom he conceives
himself to have been offended, to Fight him; he that
has renounc'd Duels may answer him after this or the
lik<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> manner: <HI>That he much wonders, that knowing the
last Edicts of the King, and particularly the Declaration
of many Gentlemen, in which he has publickly ingag'd
himself not to Fight, he will not content himself with the
clear understanding that he gives him; and that he does
not consider that he neither can, nor ought, to appoint or re∣ceive
any Place for Fighting, nor even to signifie to him the
Places where he might have a Rencounter, but that he shall
change nothing in his usual way of Living.</HI> And general∣ly
all other Gentlemen may answer, <HI>That if they are
set upon they shall defend themselves, but that they do not
think their Honour obliges them to go and Fight in cold
Blood, and so formally contravene to the Edicts of his Ma∣jesty,
to the Laws of Religion, and to their Conscience.</HI></P>
<P>IV. When there has been some Difference betwixt
Gentlemen, whereof the one Party has Promis'd and
Sign'd not to Fight, and the others not, these last
shall be alway reputed Aggressors, unless the contrary
appears by very plain Proofs.</P>
<P>V. And because the Ways of Fact might easily be
prevented, if we, the Governours or the Lieutenants-General
of the Provinces were not carefully advertiz'd
of all the Causes and Beginnings of Quarrels, we have
consulted and resolv'd, conformably to the Power
given us by the last Edict of his Majesty, Registred in
the Parliament, the King there present, the 7th of
<HI>September,</HI> 1651, to nominate and appoint alway in each
Bailywick and Seneschalty of this Kingdom, one or
more Gentlemen of Quality, Age and Ability, requisite
for taking Informations of the Differences of Gentle∣men,
and to send them to us, or to the Governours
and Lieutenants-General of the Provinces, when they
shall be there Resident; and to be generally done by
the said Gentlemen deputed, what is prescribed by the
second Article of the said Edict.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="26"/>
And we order, conformably to the same Edict,
all our Provosts, Vice-Bailiffs, Vice-Seneschals, Lieu∣tenants-Criminal
of the Short Robe, and other Offi∣cers
of the Marshalseas, to obey readily and faith∣fully
the said Gentlemen deputed, for the Execution
of their Orders.</P>
<P>VI. And to the End we may yet more carefully
be Advertiz'd of the Differences of Gentlemen, we
declare according to the Third Article of the same E∣dict,
That all Persons who shall happen to be, tho'
by Chance, at the Places where Offences shall be
given, be it by an Injurious Report, Discourses, or
Words; be it by a failure of Promise; be it by giving
the Lie; by offering Threats; a Box on the Ear; a
Stroke with a Cudgel; or other Violations of Honour;
of what Nature soever they are; shall for the future
be oblig'd to give us Notice of them, or to the Go∣vernours
or Lieutenants-General of the Provinces, or
to the Gentlemen deputed, under Pain of being re∣puted
Complices in the said Offences, and to be Pro∣secuted
as having tacitly contributed to them; and
that those who shall have Knowledge of Suits in Law,
which shall be upon the Point of being begun betwixt
Gentlemen for any Important Concern, shall also be
oblig'd, according to the same Third Article of the
said Edict, to give us Notice of it, or to the Governors,
or Lieutenants-General of the Provinces, or to the
Gentlemen deputed in the Bailywicks, to the End
that a Means may be us'd to hinder the Parties from
passing the Ways of ordinary Justice, to come to
those of Fact, and to do themselves Reason.</P>
<P>VII. And because in all Offences that may be re∣ceiv'd
it is Necessary to Establish some General Rules
for Satisfactions, which will sufficiently repair Ho∣nour
as soon as they shall be receiv'd and practis'd,
since it is but too manifest, that its Opinion which
has Establisht for the greatest Part the Maxims of
Point of Honour; and considering that in Offences
we must mind in the first Place, whether they have
been given without Cause, and if they have not been
repell'd by some Repartees or Revenges of a more
Outrageous Nature: We declare, that in those which
<PB N="12" REF="27"/>
have been so offer'd, without Cause, and which have
not been return'd, if they consist in injurious Words,
as of <HI>Sot, Coward, Traitor,</HI> and the like, it may be or∣dain'd
for Punishment, that the Offender shall be Im∣prisoned
for a Month, the Time being not to be di∣minish'd,
through the Interest or Request of any one
whatsoever, nor even through the Indulgence of the
Person offended: And that after he shall come forth of
Prison he shall declare to the Person offended, <HI>That
unmeetly and impertinently he has Offended him by Abusive
Words, which he owns to be false, and begs his Pardon
for it.</HI></P>
<P>VIII. For giving the Lie, or using Threats of a Box
on the Ear, or of a Stroke with a Stick, there may be
ordain'd Two Months Imprisonment, the Time not
to be diminished, as before; and after the Offender is
come forth of Prison, he shall ask Pardon of the Offen∣ded,
with Words more yet satisfactory than the fore∣mention'd,
and which shall be particularly specified by
the Judges of Point of Honour.</P>
<P>IX. For actual Offences of a Box on the Ear, and
the like, it shall be ordain'd for Punishment, that the
Offender shall be Imprison'd for Six Months, the Time
not to be diminish'd as before; unless the Offender shall
desire that half the Time for his Imprisonment be ex∣chang'd
into a Fine, which shall not be less than 1500
Livres, to be given to the nearest Hospital to the Place
of Abode of the Offended, and which shall be paid
before the said Offender comes forth of Prison. And
even after he shall be come forth he shall submit him∣self
also to receive from the Hand of the Offended the
like Strokes to those which he gave, and shall declare
in Words and Writing, That he has brutishly struck
him, and begs him to Pardon and Forgive this Of∣fence.</P>
<P>X.
For Strokes with a Cudgel, or the like Abuses,
the Offender shall be Imprison'd a whole Year; and
the Time not to be moderated, unless it be for Six
Months, by paying 3000 Livres Fine, payable and to
be applied as above. And after he is come forth of
Prison he shall ask Pardon of the Offended kneeling
on the Ground; shall submit himself in this State to
<PB N="13" REF="28"/>
receive the like Strokes; shall most humbly thank him
if he does not give him them, as he might do. And
shall farther declare by Word and Writing, That he
has brutishly offended him; that he begs of him to
forget it; and that if he were in his Place he would
be content with the same Satisfactions. And in all
the Offences of Strokes with the Hand, or a Stick, or
the like, beside the foresaid Punishments and Satisfa∣ctions,
the Offended may be oblig'd to chastise the
Offender with the like Strokes he has received, even
tho' he should have the Generosity of not being inclin'd
to do it; and this only in case the Offence be judg'd
so Barbarous by the Circumstances, that it deserves that
the Offended be reduc'd to this Necessity.</P>
<P>XI. And at the time the Reconciliations are made
in all the foresaid Cases, the Judges of Point of Ho∣nour
may order what number they please of the
Friends of the Offended, to see the Satisfactions which
shall be ordain'd, and render them more Notorious.</P>
<P>XII. For any Offences or Violations of Honour
which shall be offer'd a Gentleman on the account of
some Civil Interest, or of some Action which shall al∣ready
be begun before the ordinary Judges, we cannot
in Offences so hapning be too severe in the Satisfacti∣ons.
And those who shall regulate the like Differences,
besides the Punishments specified above in each kind
of Offence, may farther order Banishment for what
time they think fit from the Places where the Offen∣der
makes his ordinary Residence. And when it shall
be manifest by notoriousness of the Fact, or other
Proofs, that a Gentleman has possest himself of any
Thing by the Ways of Fact or by Surprize, no Agree∣ment
can be made, even concerning Point of Honour,
till the Thing in Contest has been first put in the State
it was before the Violence, or the Surprize.</P>
<P>XIII. And because beside the abovemention'd Causes
of Differences, Promises that are pretended to have
been made and violated, produce infinite others: We
declare, That a Gentleman who has gotten a Promise
from another, concerning any Thing whatsoever, can∣not
build thereon any Thing for the future, nor com∣plain
that it has been violated, unless it has been gi∣ven
<PB N="14" REF="29"/>
him in Writing, or in the Presence of one or more
Gentlemen. And thus all Gentlemen shall be oblig'd
for the future to take this Precaution, not only for
obeying our Orders, but likewise for the Interest each
Man has to conserve the Friendship of him who has
given him his Word, and of not being declar'd Ag∣gressor,
as he shall be henceforward in all the Quar∣rels
which shall happen after a Promise without Wri∣ting
o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Witnesses, and which he shall pretend has not
been kept.</P>
<P>XIV If a Promise given in Writing, or before o∣ther
Gentlemen, be found violated, the Person inte∣rested
shall be obliged to ask Justice of us, of the Go∣vernours
or Lieutenants-General of the Provinces, or of
the Gentlemen deputed; in default of which he shall
be reputed Aggressor in all the Quarrels which may
happen consequentially to the said Promise violated;
as also all the Witnesses of the said Promise violated,
who have not given notice of it, shall be responsible
for all the Disorders which may thence happen. And
as to what regards the said Failings of a Man's Word,
the Reparations and Satisfactions shall be ordered ac∣cording
to the Importance of the Matter.</P>
<P>XV. If by the relation of Persons present, or by o∣ther
Proofs, it appears that an Injury has been done
with a premeditated Design, in a frolick Humour, and
with an Advantage, we declare, That according to
the Laws of Honour the Offended may prosecute the
Aggressor and his Complices before the ordinary Judges,
as if he had been Assassinated; and this Proceeding
ought not to seem strange, because he that offends a∣nother
on an Advantage, renders himself by this Action
unworthy to be treated as a Gentleman: Provided
nevertheless that the Person offended had not rather refer
himself to our Judgement, or to that of other Judges of
Point of Honour for his Satisfaction, and for the Cha∣stisement
of the Aggressor; which ought to be much
greater than all the preceding, that regard only those
Offences which are offered in Quarrels that happen by
Chance.</P>

XVI. In case a Gentleman refuses, or deferrs with∣out
any lawful Cause, to obey our Orders, or those of
the other Judges of Point of Honour, as to render him∣self
before us or them, when he has been summon'd
by an Act signified to him, or at his House, and also
when he has not undergone the Pains ordain'd against
him, he shall alway be constrain'd to it, after a certain
Time prescrib'd him, by being kept under Guard in
his House or Imprison'd, conformably to the Eighth
Article of the said Edict, which shall be carefully exe∣cuted
by our Provosts, Vice-Bailiffs, Vice-Seneschals,
Lieutenants-Criminal of the Short Robe, and other
Lieutenants and Sergeants of the Marshaiseas, under
Pain of Suspension of their Places, and Privation of
their Salary; and the said Execution shall be perform'd
at the Cost and Charges of the Party disobedient and
refractory.</P>
<P>XVII. And according to the same Eighth Article of
the said Edict, if our Provosts, Vice-Bailiffs, Vice-Se∣neschals,
Lieutenants-Criminal of the Short Robe, and
other Officers of the Marshalseas, cannot execute the
said Imprisonments, they shall seize all the Revenues
of the said disobedient Persons, shall give Notice of
the said Seizures to the Solicitors-General, or to their
Substitutes, according to the last Declaration against
Duels, Registred in the Parliament of <HI>Paris</HI> the 29th of
<HI>July</HI> last; the said Revenues to be apply'd, and to
continue all the time of the Disobedience acquir'd, to
the Hospital of the Town where the Parliament shall
be, under the Jurisdiction of which the Estates of the
disobedient Persons are, conjointly with the Hospital
of the Royal Seat of Jurisdiction whence they also de∣pend;
to the End that interaiding each other in the
Prosecution, the one may furnish the Information and
Proof, and the other the Justice and Authority. And
in case there are precedent Debts, which hinder the
receipt of the Revenue confiscated to the Profit of the
said Hospitals, the Sum to which the said Revenue
might amount, shall become a Mortgag'd Debt on all
the Estate moveable and immoveable of the Disobedi∣ent,
to be paid and discharg'd in its Order, according
to the same Eighth Article of the said Edict.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="31"/>
XVIII. If those to whom we and the other Judges
of Point of Honour have given Guards, shall make
their Escape, the Reconciliation shall not be made till
they have kept Prison during the Time ordain'd.</P>
<P>XIX. And generally in all the other Differences of
Offences, which have not been specified here above,
and whereof the variety is infinite; as if they have
been made with Cause, and if they have been
repell'd with more heinous Repartees: Or if by
outrageous Words the Person offending has drawn on
himself the Lie, or some stroke with the Hand; and
in a word, in all other Occasions of Injuries insensibly
aggravated; we remit it to the Judges of Point of Ho∣nour
to ordain such Punishments and Satisfactions as
the Case and Circumstances shall require; exhorting
them to have alway a particular Consideration to him
who has been the Aggressor and the first Cause of the
Offence; and to send before us all those who are desi∣rous
to represent to us their Reasons conformably to
the second Article of the first Edict of his Majesty, Re∣gistred,
as is said, in the Parliament the 7th of <HI>Septem∣ber,</HI>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OF all the Titles which belong to your Majesty
through the Right of your Ancestors, and the
Splendor of your Vertues, I find none more Il∣lustrious
nor more Glorious than that of the Sword of
the Christian World, which was given St. <HI>Louis</HI> by an
Emperor of the <HI>Tartars;</HI> because this Elogy, by some
relation to the Quality of <HI>Lord of Hosts</HI> which the Ho∣ly
Scripture has given to God, declares your Majesty
not only the Protector of the Church, but likewise
Sovereign Umpire of Combats. <HI>Marcellus</HI> was the
first to whom was given the formidable Name of the
Sword of the World, because he was an invincible De∣fender
of the Liberty of the <HI>Romans;</HI> but with whom
may it more justly agree than with a most Christian
King, who from his most tender Infancy has quencht
the Fire of Civil Wars, and who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Majority
counts fewer Years than Victories against the Ancient
Enemies of this Crown? So the Zeal to Religion, and
the Instinct of a natural Valour, have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your Ma∣jesty
with the Christian and Generous Resolution of
renewing your Solemn Edicts against Fatal Combats,
where the noblest Portion of your Subjects, abandon∣ing,
through a Fatal Blindness, the Salvation of their
<PB N="18" REF="33"/>
Souls, shew the Marks of their Weakness, when they
think to signalize the Grandure of their Courage.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> We thought that the Care of the Salvation of
Souls, wherein our Duty engages us, oblig'd our Or∣der
to give most humble Thanks to your Majesty for a
Law so Holy, tho' indeed we could have wisht that the
Articles of the Edict, which concern Burials and Ec∣clesiastical
Censures, had been coucht in Terms which
had not offended the Ecclesiastical Authority: And as
we carry the Word of the Church, which declares al∣way
the Word of God, we have thought it at the
same time our indispensable Duty to join to our
Thanksgivings some Important Instructions for the
Success of the Religious Intentions of your Maje∣sty.</P>
<P>The
<HI>Romans</HI> who establisht their Empire by the
violence of Arms, on the Ruins of the most Power∣ful
Monarchies, were so strongly possest with the bru∣tal
Fury of Duels, that according to the relation of one
of their most Famous Historians, in the beginning of
their State they own'd no other Judge, even for sha∣ring
their Estates, than the Chance of Combats: So
that the wisest among them propos'd insensibly Laws
to the People, to the end, that without spilling
Blood Actions might be determin'd by the sole Ways
of Justice; we may say, that this furious Spirit had
past to the <HI>French</HI> till the Age of St. <HI>Louis,</HI> who con∣demn'd
the detestable Abuse which was introduc'd, of
permitting, on certain Occasions, set Combats. And
our Kings, animated by so powerful an Example, have
taken Care from time to time to cause new Edicts to
be Publisht against this wicked Attempt: But, alas!
the multitude of Remedies have exasperated the Di∣stemper
instead of appeasing it; the Laws have been
violated with Iniquity, and the Prohibitions have
serv'd but to add Insolence to the Crime.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> Certainly there was never so dangerous an In∣justice,
nor so strange an Overthrow of good Maxims,
as when the <HI>French,</HI> through a phantastical Conceit,
and a false Idea they conceiv'd of Vertue, join'd Glory
to the Fury of <HI>Duels:</HI> This Barbarous Action has been
<PB N="19" REF="34"/>
Condemn'd by the whole Church: The Council of
<HI>Trent</HI> strikes with <HI>Anathema</HI> those that are guilty of
them; it separates them from the Society of the Faith∣ful,
to shew us that God has already cut them off in
Heaven from the Company of the Blessed; and to extend
their Penalty after Death, it deprives them of Church
Burial. Your Majesty in your Throne of Justice, where
you Soveraignly decide the true Point of Honour, pu∣nishes
with the last Punishment these infamous Gladia∣tors;
true Reason condemns them also of Weakness.
In reality, whoever is not able to wait the Reparation
of an Injury by Publick Authority, shews his Impo∣tency
in resisting the more severe Assaults of Fortune;
for being reduc'd to the Extremity either of Support∣ing
constantly an Offence, or to hazard his Life to Re∣venge
it, he Cowardly chuses a less Ill to avoid a
greater, that is to say, the Danger of Death, to free him∣self
from an imaginary Infamy which appears to him
Insupportable.</P>
<P>Nevertheless I am forc'd to say with an extream
Grief, that all Reasonings make no Impression on the
Mind in this Occasion; that the Rigour of the Edicts
is contemptible; and that even the Fulminations of the
Church become of no Force for breaking the hardness
of Mens Hearts, while there is room for imagining
that your Majesty gives some part of your Esteem to
these Sanguinary Men: So true it is that the <HI>French</HI>
Nobility, who are jealous of their Reputation above
all the Nations of the Earth, look on your Majesty
as the only Umpire, and the Sole Disposer of Glory.
And therefore, <HI>Sir,</HI> if your Majesty will reform a
Disorder which weakens your State, if you will ma∣nage
the Blood of the Noblest of your Subjects for
your Service in your Armies, if you will divert the
Anger of God, from whom the Voice of Blood spilt
by Murther continually calls for Vengeance, you must
declare your Sentiments by Marks of Infamy on the
Guilty; your private Discourses must accord with your
Edicts; you must speak in your Privy Closet as on
the Tribunals of Justice; and that being persuaded
there is Cowardice in Duels, it may imprint so just
an Opinion in the Spirits of your Nobility.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="35"/>
Solid Honour is inseparably join'd to Duty; it's as
a Ray which necessarily derives itself from the Light;
it's a Flower which cannot be gathered but from the
Stalk of Vertue: And as Kings give Proofs of their
Courage, when according to your Majesties Example
they expose their Lives in the Head of their Armies for
the Good of their State; so Subjects give a Testimo∣ny
of their Valour when they expose their Lives for
the Service of their Kings. The most Famous Duelists
have never been our most Illustrious Captains; and
those who have best succeeded in these unjust Com∣bats,
are not the Men who have defeated our Enemies
in Battles; Ang<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> or Fury have much a greater Part in
those brutal Actions than <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Valour. It is Passion
which counsels them, it's Chance or Skill which brings
them off, it's Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om which approves them, and final∣ly,
it's the Demon of the Age which crowns them. I
add, That your Majesty is very greatly interested in
so Noble a Sentiment; for if Honour were included
in Duel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, it would follow that your Majesty, who
disputes already in your first Exploits the Prize of Mi∣litary
Vertue with the greatest Captains, would find
yourself depriv'd of an Occasion of Glory, as not b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing
to enter this List of single Combats; much more
through the Default of an Adversary of your Strength▪
than by the Rank of your Birth, since our Age pro∣duces
not <HI>Alexanders</HI> nor <HI>Caesars</HI> to enter the Field
with you.</P>
<P>I call here before the Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one of your Majesty that
Illustrious Body of Gentlemen, of the greatest Houses
of the Kingdom, who after having given signal Proof,
of their Courage on divers Occasions for your Service,
have generously r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nounc'd by a Solemn Writing the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣lusion
of the Evil Spirit, to keep the Obligations <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
their Baptism: Shall it be said that they wax Pale at
the first Aspect of Death? They look it in the Face dai∣ly
very near, under a more horrible Aspect, in the
midst of Armies. Shall it be said that they dread the
Efforts of their Enemies? They are not capable of
Fear, according to the Maxims of the Gospel, but
for your Anger, and that of God, who can deliver
<PB N="21" REF="36"/>
Body and Soul to eternal Punishments. Shall it be
said that they are touch'd with a Passion of less Zeal
for your Service? On the contrary, their Fidelity is
supported on a Foundation not to be shaken, since they
are tied to their Duty toward your Majesty by the
same Principle which unites them with God.</P>
<P>I should prevaricate in this Cause if I did not most
humbly supply your Majesty to make a serious Re∣flection
on the Miracle which God began to operate in
your Reign by the holy Conspiracy of these Christian
Heroes; but I should be much more guilty to retain
Truth a Captive in Injustice, if I should dissemble to
you that all the Gifts of God turn alway to our Salva∣tion,
or to our Ruin. <HI>Sir,</HI> Permit me to say, with the
Liberty which my Function gives me, that your Ma∣jesty
cannot receive with Indifference the Means which
God presents you for stopping the Rage of Duels; for
as the Chief Cause of this Blindness depends on the
Esteem of the Nobility, who have no more certain
Rule in their Actions, than the Precious Judgment of
your Majesty; it follows, that as you may quell this
cruel Disorder by the Marks of your Contempt and
Aversion, you may also foment it by the contrary Sen∣timents;
and thus by a Misfortune which we will be∣lieve
impossible, you would become in some sort a
Complice of the Crime of particular Men.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> We do not beg of your Majesty to apply vio∣lent
Remedies, to impose new Punishments, to render
Houses desolate, or to cut off Heads, (though all these
Chastisements are much beneath that Fury;) we bear
in Mind the Mildness of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> who obliges us,
by his Example, to seek the Salvation of Sinners by
the Principle of Charity, and never by that of Ven∣geance.
The Church is a Good Mother, which la∣bours
for the Conversion of her Children, and she ne∣ver
solicits their Loss; she asks only of your Majesty
by my Mouth, that you cut off the Essential Cause of
the Evil; that you destroy a Contagious Opinion
which Poisons Spirits; that you highly discredit Du∣els;
that you load them with Infamy; that you ba∣nish
from your Presence the Guilty; that you deprive
them of your Favours; that you keep the same Lan∣guage
<PB N="22" REF="37"/>
in your Discourses as in your Edicts; and that
finally you declare on all Occasions, that as a Duel is
an Action full of Rage, which has not the Character
of true Valour, so it does not Merit but the Effects of
your Indignation.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> We cannot doubt but your Majesty will Em∣ploy
your Authority and most urgent Cares for Re∣pressing
this Unbridled Liberty, and for Advancing
the Prosperity of this State, while we see the Best and
Greatest Queen of the World seated near your Majesty
in your Counsels: It is she who has guided the Vessel
of the State in the midst of the Tempest, fortified by
the wise Councels of this Great Minister, whose Spirit
has alway presided o'er our Affairs, and who in all
our Agitations has thought much less on his own An∣gers,
than on those of the Publick Fortune. It is she who
has merited the Honours which the <HI>Romans</HI> render'd
formerly to those who had preserv'd the Empire, since
that in deplorable Times, the Imagination of which
strikes a Terrour, she has maintain'd the Crown on
the Head of your Majesty. Finally, It is the whom
God has given you as the most Precious Pledge of his
Love, his Protection being not to be shewn more vi∣sibly
than by preserving to you a Mother full of Ten∣derness
for your Perso<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ of Zeal for your State, and of
Experience for your Affairs. <HI>Sir,</HI> Some of the Kings of
<HI>Judah</HI> undertook the Destruction of Idols; but through
Humane Considerations they in some sort tolerated the
Worship. Whence it is that the Holy Scripture, which
praises <HI>Joas</HI> as a Religious Prince, presently fades his
Elogy by this Bloody Reproach: And nevertheless says
it, he fell into the Error of his Predecessors; for he
did not subvert the Altars which were rais'd on the
Height of Mountains. Ah! <HI>Sir,</HI> suffer not a Spot like
that of the Kings of <HI>Judah</HI> to darken the Splendor
of your Name; break all to pieces the Idol of false
Honour, to which an infinite Number of Souls have
been Sacrificed in the Ages past; compleat the Enter∣prize
which your Predecessors have only dar'd to be∣gin,
and which they left imperfect, happily through
the troublesome Conjunctures of their Reigns; it
seems also that God has reserv'd the Glory to your
<PB N="23" REF="38"/>
Majesty, by the Advantages which he has rais'd for its
Accomplishment. Give Protection to this Generous
Nobility, who offer their Assistance for the Execution
of so Christian a Design. Confirm the Authority of
your Laws by the Respectful Subscription of all the
Great Persons of your Kingdom, of all the Officers of
your House, and of all those generally who have the
Honour of approaching your August Person. Declare
Solemnly, and as a King, and as a <HI>Brave,</HI> concerning
the Point of true Honour; and finally, for an Accom∣plishment
of a Reputation as Clear as Great, put a
Stop to this Criminal Proof of an Artificial Courage.
We assure also your Majesty, as the Depositories of the
Divine Promises, that God by his more particular Fa∣vours
will add to the Crown which shines on your
Head a new Glory, which is wisht to your Majesty
with the most Ardent Vows of</P>

Faithful Subjects and Servants.</CLOSER>

<HEAD>A Circulatory Letter of the Gentlemen Gover∣nours
of the Hospital of Paris, to the Go∣vernours
of the other Hospitals of France.</HEAD>
<P>GEntlemen, it is now a long time since Duels have
molested <HI>France,</HI> and that each Man has wisht a
Remedy Powerful enough to put a Stop to this Dis∣order
so common at present: There is not need of
many Reasons for conceiving a Horror against them;
tho' we had not the Zeal of Christianity, it would be
enough for us to have some Sentiments of Humanity,
and not to be absolute Barbarians; to use all our Ef∣forts,
that Persons who are well in Health should no
longer cut their own Throats; and that those who
have no Quarrel, should no longer Sacrifice themselves
to pay the Office of a Friend in the Quality of Se∣conds.
It's only in <HI>France</HI> that Men revenge themselves
by the way of Duel; all the other Nations of the
World, either the most Generous, the most Politick,
<PB N="24" REF="39"/>
or the most Brutist, absolutely condemn this Action▪
which is a <HI>Mania</HI> of the <HI>French.</HI> If a Person has re∣ceiv'd
an Injury, why shall he farther prostitute his
Life in order to a Satisfaction? Does not the Person
offended Fight with Arms equal with the Offender?
And does he not put himself in danger of being
Wounded or Kill'd, or to Beg his Life? Is it not to
expose a Man's self to a greater Injury, instead of re∣pairing
the first? We have seen within this Age
Edicts, Declarations, and Decrees, against Duels; they
have been put in the Number of the Crimes of High
Treason; they have been judg'd so Horrid and De∣testable,
that the Death of the Duelists does not ex∣empt
them from Penalties, nor from Shame: To
Condemn them after a more Remarkable Manner
Two Edicts have been Publisht on Two Glorious
Days; the one, at the coming of the late King
of Happy Memory to the Crown, <HI>Anno</HI> 1610;
and the other at the Majority of our present King
happily Reigning, <HI>Anno</HI> 1651. All the Prohibi∣tions
and Penalties have been hitherto to no
Purpose; and it seems that since the Prohibi∣tions
have been most express, and the Penalties
most severe, Duels are become more frequent, and
the Way of Fighting more Cruel; we have under∣stood
that since some Time there have been some
which could not proceed but from Fury and Despair.
The King by his last Declaration has put in Practice
all the Precautions possible for stopping this impetu∣ous
Torrent of Duels; and because it is true that
many Persons cannot come to a Resolution of Prosecu∣ting
by the Way of Justice the Reparation of an In∣jury,
and that it is not reasonable that Injuries should
remain Unpunisht, Expedients have been provided
for satisfying each Man by Ways which consist with
Honour, without Penalty and Danger. The Mar∣shals
of <HI>France,</HI> or the Lords who shall be deputed
in the Provinces, shall give Order to have Justice done,
and that it shall be Punctual, without a Man's being
oblig'd to any Formality. This Way is Good and
Innocent, whereas that which a Man takes of him∣self
is Hurtful and Criminal; since there are good
<PB N="25" REF="40"/>
Ways for revenging Injuries, those who will Revenge
themselves are by so much the less Excuseable: It is
nevertheless difficult to stop this Impetuosity of the
Passion of Duels, which is Unfortunately in Use a∣mong
the <HI>French;</HI> wherefore there is need of some∣thing
above all the other Remedies. The King of his
own Inclination, as well as by his Edicts, the Lords
Spiritual in their General Assembly, the Lords Mar∣shals
of <HI>France</HI> by Particular Articles, and a great
many Lords and Gentlemen by their Submissions,
and by their Writings under their Hands, concur to
one and the same End, of no longer sparing any thing
for hindring Duels; the Magistrates also contribute
their Zeal, and use with Severity the Power of their
Justice against the Guilty. It may possibly be thought
strange that the Governours of the Hospitals should
take Part, and should concern themselves in this Oc∣casion,
since the Cognizance of Duels is very remote
from their Functions: It may be said, that if Duels
trouble them because they offend Religion and Cha∣rity,
they may detest and bewail them, but they can
do no more; that they ought not to take Cognizance
of them, that they ought not even to accuse nor in∣form
of the Crimes: Our Intention is not to meddle
with any Thing above our Function: In Truth we
had had Recourse but to Sighs and Tears, in Refe∣rence
to Duels, unless Two Things engag'd us to In∣terest
our selves in them; the one because the Poor
have the Third Part of the Goods con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iscated on this
Occasion, and that we cannot in Conscience neglect
their Interest; this Reason alone would not invite
us, but after the Confiscations judg'd, and not before;
but the other is, that by taking at present an exact
Cognizance of Duels, it is not so much an Enterprize
in us as an Act of Obedience we obey the King's In∣tentions,
and the Orders of the Powers of the King∣dom.
This Service is requir'd of us for the Publick,
we are oblig'd to pay it to avoid so great an Evil as
Duels; what we have Resolv'd, and have begun to
Execute, is approv'd; it is judg'd that an entire Cor∣respondence
betwixt all the Governours of all the
Hospitals of <HI>Franc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> hath a great Effect; and we are
<PB N="26" REF="41"/>
assur'd that as soon as there shall be seen an Execution
of our Design, there will presently be reviv'd the o∣ther
Overtures which seem for some Time to have
fall'n asleep, and the Cares will be redoubled for ma∣king
the Protestations which have been made to suc∣ceed.
It is to obey the Orders which we have receiv'd
that we inform our selves of the Duels which have
been committed, and of the Rencounters that have
happen'd, since the Month of <HI>September,</HI> 1651. We
have nominated Five among us as Particular Com∣missioners
on what concerns Duels. It's to the End
that they may proceed in it with a more singular Af∣fection,
and that the ordinary Affairs of the Body
of the Governours be not interrupted; our Deputies
meet every <HI>Tuesday</HI> of each Week; they receive there
Informations; they propose there what is to be pro∣pos'd;
they deliberate there, and conclude of the
Things that present themselves. They have a Parti∣cular
Secretary, and a Register of Things Decreed,
which is distinct from that of our Body; but when
there are Important or Extraordinary Occasions, the
Report is made in full Assembly; and in this Case
the Things concluded are set down in the Common
Register, whereof nevertheless mention is made
in that of Duels. We send you, Gentlemen, some
Extracts of what we have already resolv'd; the In∣tent
of our Court is, that to make a Discovery of the
Crime with more Ease, and to procure some Good
to the Poor by the Thirds which is appointed for
them, there shall be some Part of the Thirds given
to those who shall give Notice of Duels committed,
obliging us to furnish the Proofs by them, if the Con∣viction
cannot be had otherways, and to give by
them Lights of the Es<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ates, if the Knowledge can∣not
otherwise be had: This shall be done with re∣gard
to Circumstances of Things and Persons. It is
sometimes good to interess some one with the Poor;
and in all this Conduct we ought to regard but God
and the Poor; these are the Sole Motives which ought
to animate us, and the Sole Thoughts which we
ought to have; we shall so do that nothing may be
imputed nor reproacht to the Administrators of the
<PB N="27" REF="42"/>
Hospital of <HI>Paris,</HI> and even to secure our selves as
much as we may, both from a Default and Negli∣gence.
We Promise our selves, Gentlemen, as much
or more on your Part, since we are assur'd of the
Piety of your Employ, whence we easily presume,
and as it were necessarily, the Sincerity of your Inten∣tions,
and all that may depend of it. If the first Let∣ter
which we writ to you has not had all the Success
that was expected, we are chiefly the Cause, either
for not having sufficiently explain'd our selves, or for
not having opened enough the Motives, the Conse∣quences
and the Effects, of the Design, which ought
to be common betwixt us; we do it at present, and
we pray you, Gentlemen, to inform us of all the
Duels which have been committed in your Town and
the Neighbourhood since the Month of <HI>September,</HI>
1651; and to continue your Informations for the fu∣ture,
if any shall be committed henceforward, and to
set down the Persons, the Conditions and the Estates,
of those who have Fought; of those who have
sent or given Challenges; of their Seconds, or the
greatest Number of them; of the Dead and Wound∣ed;
what are their Parents and Allies, their Credit
or their Support, in the Province; we do not ask only
a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Correspondence of the Gentlemen Governours of the
Hospitals, who are within the reach of the Parlia∣ment
of <HI>Paris,</HI> we ask it also of the Gentlemen
Governours of the Hospitals of the Towns where
there is a Parliament, and we supply them to write
to the Gentlemen Governours of the Hospitals which
are within the Limits of their Parliament, to the End
there may be a like Correspondence betwixt them,
and that by thus doing it be Universal throughout the
Kingdom. We may by this Means root out, or
cause to be punisht, a Crime with offends God
and the King, the Publick and our Neighbour,
and which makes us despair of the Salvati∣on,
as well as of the Life, of those who commit it.
We may conclude of having for Obstacles Persons of
all Qualities, of all Humours, and of all Ages; be∣cause
there is now almost no one, either of the Peasants
or Nobility, of the Soldiery, and even of Serving-men,
<PB N="28" REF="43"/>
as well as of Gentlemen, and of all others who make
Profession of Arms, but will revenge his Quarrel, or give
a Testimony of his Valour, by a Duel: We must try to
undeceive this false Generosity, to overcome all the
Difficulties, to be obstinately resolv'd in so Pious and
so Holy an Enterprize, and to stand firm against all
Sorts of Prayers and Considerations: We Promise you,
Gentlemen, our Cares and Pains, and to solicit for all
the King, the Court, and all those who have a lawful
Authority to Command, Prohibit, and Punish: We
Promise you an Assiduousness without Remission, an
inflexible Vigour, and that entire Correspondence
which we ask also of you, for the better upholding
us in it, it is good for us all to be known: We entreat
you, Gentlemen, that when you shall do us the Ho∣nour
to write to us, you will signifie to us by your
Letters, or by a particular Memoir, the Names, Qua∣lities,
and the Number of your Body, whether your
Government be Perpetual, or for a Time? When,
how▪ and by whom the Changes are made in it? if
the Church, the Magistrates, or other Officers, have
Part in it, either of Necessity, or Choice? whether
there are Bodies or Commonalties under which they
are? or whether there be an entire Liberty of chu∣sing
all Sorts of P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsons, and of all Sorts of Professions?
To send us word also what Order you will keep in this
Matter, and to whom of your Company we must Ad∣dress
us? Or wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther we shall continue to write to
your entire Body? We would not draw any Thing
from you but what you may know of us. After ha∣ving
given you to understand what we have Resolv'd,
and begun to Execute, whereof we send you some
Extracts, we Inform you of our Government: It is
at present compos'd of Sixteen Persons; the Lord
first President of the Parliament is alway the Chief:
We have alway had the Happiness to have a Head
greatly affected to the Body of Governours. The Lord
first President <HI>de Bellieure,</HI> lately Deceas'd, whom no
one can enough Lament, nor Praise, has given very
Powerful Testimonies by his Presence with the Body,
by his Councils at Home, and by his Reputation on all
<PB N="29" REF="44"/>
Occasions; he confirm'd them the Day before his De∣cease,
by the Rich Present he made to the Poor of the
Hospital of the Precious Furniture of his Chamber:
God having taken him from us, we hope in his Place
a worthy Successor. We have ordinarily with the
Lord first President of the Parliament, the Lords first
Presidents of the Chamber of Accounts, and of the
Court of Aids. There are beside the Lords of the
Sovereign Companies in the Number of the others,
which are nominated by the Company, according as
there is a vacant Place by Death. We are all Sworn in
the great Chamber; and tho' our Employ be during
Life, it may be said with Truth, that each Man is
very zealous of employing there all his Time and his
Care. We send you the List of those who compose
the Body of Judicature. We have a Receiver and a
Register. The usual great Number of the Diseas'd,
of Persons, and of Things necessary for the Subsistence
and Maintenance of the Hospital of <HI>Paris,</HI> obliges us to
have a great many Officers and Domesticks. It is true,
the Revenue is considerable; but we owe it to the
Particular Blessing of Heaven, that tho' the Disburse∣ments
exceed the Revenue above a Hundred Thousand
Livres each Year, which is a Truth not known to e∣very
one, but very easie to justifie, the House neverthe∣less
subsists; we daily acknowledge Sorts of Miracles
both in its Government, and in extraordinary Favours.
Behold, Gentlemen, the Account we give you, both
very Punctual, and very Sincere; we hope from you
that you will give us a Light of your Government as
True and Faithful. We beg the Grace that we may
have all a Resolution and Strength in an Occasion so
Laudable, as that of hindring Duels, whereby we
may Serve God and the King, the Publick and our
Neighbour. We should Serve at the same Time those
who would Destroy themselves, having an Intention
to Fight: We Pray them to reflect on Themselves,
and not to put Themselves in a Condition that
we may have a Right to ask for the Poor the
Possession of their Estates: We Pray them to con∣sider
how favourable the Poor are, and that they
shall be well grounded to make this Demand of
<PB N="30" REF="45"/>
their Estates on the Account of the King's Declaration:
And if they are not concern'd for being Indebted to
God, to the King, and to the Publick, let them be
concern'd at least because they are Indebted to their
Persons, to their Honour, and to their Salvation; to
their Wives, if Married; to their Children, if they
are Fathers; and to their House, if they are Generous
and Reasonable: Let them suffer themselves to be con∣vinc'd
by a Truth which seems to be out of Doubt,
that it is glorious to serve his Prince in the Army,
but that it is shameful to Perish by Single Combats,
as Duels are. If a Man will expose himself to Die
with his Arms in his Hand, it ought to be for the
Service of the King and Kingdom, and not for a Quar∣rel,
or for a Passion. What Mischief, and what Hor∣rour,
for a Man to render himself in a Moment Un∣happy
and Miserable! When there is Question of the
least Important Affair in a Family, where there may
be a Concern of Fortune, Relations are gathered toge∣ther,
Things are Propos'd and Deliberated of. When
there is a Question of Health, as of the least Indisposi∣tion
of Body, recourse is made to the Advice of Phy∣sicians,
and Persons apply themselves to the search of
all Remedies for getting Relief. When there is Que∣stion
of a Point of Conscience, Men apply themselves
to their Directors: And in this Occasion where the
whole loss of Fortune, Life, and Salvation, is con∣cern'd,
all is left to Hazard without Deliberating, all
is left at Random without making any Proposition,
and Men withdraw themselves privately from all the
World, lest they be diverted from losing in an Instant
all that may lose for ever a Man and a Christian. Re∣present
to yourselves, Gentlemen, a Man in a State
of Fighting, in which State he is in the Action of a
Duel, and his State after the Duel; this Courage in
which he so much Glories is but the Appearance of
a Generosity, and the true Effect of a Criminal Cow∣ardice,
as not being able to suffer a Contempt, an In∣jury,
or a Word; and refusing to use the Ways which
the King prescribes for a Reparation. He causes a
Challenge to be given, he goes to the Place appointed;
<PB N="31" REF="46"/>
he that receives the Challenge goes there also, both
contemn their Lives and the King's Edicts; the one
because he believes himself Offended, and the other
because he imagines his Honour is concerned not to
refuse a Challenge. Nay, there is sometimes so much
Imprudence in it, that Men prostitute themselves
without there being any Injury, or Ill Design in Word
or Deed: And mean while he that thinks himself Of∣fended,
forgets all; not so much for drawing thence
a Satisfaction, which would still be a Thing Unjust,
as for running upon Danger, which is the last of all
Extremities: And in which he engages his Friend,
who was not concern'd, which is the chief of all Fol∣lies.
They will all do an Action of Prudence and Se∣cresie,
by withdrawing themselves privily from all the
World to Fight, that they may neither have Relief
nor Witnesses: So that if the Act of Duelling be
Glorious, there is no Man who can give a Faithful
Testimony of it; and they take no Witnesses, because
it is a Shame to Fight. It is not enough to commit a
Shameful Action, they are beside depriv'd of all Kinds
of Assistances at a Time in which there may be most
Need. As they abandon God, their Family, and
themselves, they will be abandon'd by all Men. If
they divest themselves of their Cloaths, it's a sign
that they depose all Sense; and the Shift which is
kept on is the Symbol of the Foolish Vanity which is
reserv'd, and which is not depos'd by them but at
Death. If there be some other Passion, it's only that
of Perishing: For whatsoever happens of it, it's al∣way
to Perish. The Preparatives for this Action are
but Instruments for Perishing: There are carried there
but Swords, Daggers, Knives, and of late Pistols, or
other Fire-Arms. Is it not to Perish to be reduc'd to
beg Life when you would take it away? If a Man
has the Advantage of the Field by killing his Man,
he is constrain'd to fly, he must quit his House, his
Family, his Country, and his Estate, to save himself.
It is not difficult to imagine the Disquiet, Remorses,
Griefs, Troubles, and Sufferings, of a Fugitive. Now
all Hopes must be lost of obtaining Favour, or Letters
<PB N="32" REF="47"/>
in the Case of Duels, for any Persons whatsoever.
A Man must no longer take a Resolution of Fighting,
but he must make a Reflection on the Necessity of
Perishing. It may be said of Perishing, since that for
a Moment of Revenge there remains but a continual
Affliction, and without Hope for the Rest of the Life.
If a Man dies in the Field, is it not to perish more,
since that a Man cannot perish more than by Death?
And since that it is not Dying as a Man, nor as a Chri∣stian?
It is not Dying as a Man to Die a violent
Death, procur'd by a Man's Self; to Die Despairing,
to Die Overthrown or Destroy'd by his Enemy, lying
along on the Dust, on the Grass, or on the Dung∣hil;
to bite the Earth, and all that is in his way;
to be more concern'd at his Impotency of Execu∣ting
his Passion, than of thinking of what ought
more nearly to touch him; and to vomit forth his
Blood and Soul at the same Time that he vomits
forth his Anger and his Rage. It is not to Die as a
Christian, not to Lament his Sins, and not to be Pe∣nitent
before he Dies. Alas! how far is a Man re∣mote
from that State, when he sets upon all Things
against the Commandments of God, and against the
Prohibitions of his Prince. Dying in Despair a Man
dies in a Crime, and it's a double Crime for a Man
to Die in a Design of Revenge. The gaping Wounds
are not Mouths for Prayer, nor for asking Mercy; but
only Mouths of Blasphemies, and Breaches for Death.
As we make a Profession of Christianity, can we think
without Horrour, what Eternity this Moment pro∣duces?
the Carcass is left on the Earth; and if it be
taken up, it's only by the Enemy to hide it, or by
a Servant, or by the Hand of Justice: Justice must
be deceiv'd, that the Body may not receive a new
Ignominy after Death; the Church must be deceiv'd,
that it may be Buried in Holy Ground; the Publick
must be deceiv'd, if the Possession of his Estate may
be preserv'd to his Children, or Relations; finally, the
Judges and Witnesses must be deceiv'd, that the Me∣mory
of the Defunct be not Condemn'd. But if the
Crime be too well known, and the Confiscation be
inevitable, Friends must be sought to for Obtaining
<PB N="33" REF="48"/>
of the King the Confiscation, and the Possession of
the Estates of the Living and of the Dead, without
Gift, Will, or any Title of Succession, and without
having any Obligation either to the Liberality of those
that possest them, or to the Benefit of the Law; but
there must be no longer Hope of this last Comfort,
which remain'd to Relations: The Third of the E∣states
of those who have fought a Duel belongs to the
Governours of the Hospitals, and it cannot be touch'd:
A Third belongs to the Informers, which it will be
endeavour'd that they shall keep: As to the other
Third, it is appointed for the Charge, which will in
a manner alway consume it, or at least for the great∣est
part; so that these are Losses without Recovery,
which each Man ought to apprehend, tho' the other
Punishments were not to be fear'd. Excuse us, Gen∣tlemen,
for that in a Letter we fully point forth to
you Duels and their Consequences; tho' this passes
the Bounds of a Letter, and it's but a weak and im∣perfect
Draught of a Publick Truth, possibly this
Enterprize may not be wholly useless: It is not e∣nough
that a Crime which we have to oppose be
known to us, all the Circumstances of it must be re∣presented,
to fortifie us in our Design; we shall make
greater Efforts to procure a greater Good, when we
shall have present in our Thoughts the Excess of the
Evil which we will hinder. Haply also these Letters
may fall into the Hands of Persons who may be in a
Disposition to do it, and who will make a Reflection
on it before they will commit it; they will think that
if they fall into this Misfortune, they shall have in a
manner as many Parties or Informers against them as
there are Governours of Hospitals in <HI>France,</HI> who be∣ing
United in Innocence, Reason and Justice, will be
much more Powerful than a Particular Person, or than
all the Relations and Friends of a Guilty Person.
Think of it well, Gentlemen, and let us all think of
it. Let us consider that it is to please God, the King,
and the Publick; that we shall not do a Thing as not
appertaining to our Functions by Hindring a Disorder,
which makes many Widows, and many Orphans. We
may contribute to the Preserving of a Husband to a
<PB N="34" REF="49"/>
Wife, of a Father to Children, of Children to their
Father, of a Relation to his Relation, of a Friend to
his Friend: We may bring it to pass, that young Gen∣tlemen
and young Lords may give to the Exercises of
Vertue, or at least to Vertuous Companies, what they
employ in the Maintenance of Gladiators, and in Dan∣gerous
Sollicitations. We shall participate in the Good
which the State and particular Persons will receive by
it. We may by this means merit in this World,
receive in the other a Recompence. We are all
convinc'd of the Disorder, and of the Good: We
humbly pray you, Gentlemen, to have the same Sen∣timents
as those, who are,</P>

<HEAD>An Edict of the King, containing a General
Regulation concerning Duels, made at St.
Germains en Lay in the Month of <DATE>August,
1679,</DATE> registred in Parliament the First Day
of September of the same Year.</HEAD>
<P>LOuis, <HI>by the Grace of God King of</HI> France <HI>and</HI> Na∣varre:
To all the present and to come, <HI>Greeting:</HI>
As we acknowledge that one of the greatest Favours
which we have receiv'd from God, in the Govern∣ment
and Encouragement of our State, consists in the
Firmness which he has been pleas'd to give us for
Maintaining the Prohibitions of Duels and Single
Combats, and severely Punish those who have con∣traven'd
to a Law so Just and so Necessary for the
Preservation of our Nobility; we are throughly re∣solv'd
to cultivate with Care so particular a Favour,
<PB N="35" REF="50"/>
which gives us ground to hope that we may be able
to arrive, during our Reign, to the Abolishment of this
Crime, after having been attempted in vain by the
Kings, our Predecessors. For this Effect, we have
apply'd ourselves anew to examine well all the Edicts
and Ordinances made against Duels, and all that has
been done consequentially to them, to which we have
judg'd it necessary to add divers Articles. For these
Causes, and other Good and Great Considerations
moving us thereunto, with the Advice of our Privy-Council,
and through our certain Knowledge, full
Power and Royal Authority, after having examin'd
in our said Council what our most Dear and Well-beloved
Cousins, the Marshals of <HI>France,</HI> who have
met together oftentimes on this Subject have pro∣pos'd
to us: We, by Renewing the Prohibitions made
by our Edicts and Ordinances, and those of the Kings,
our Predecessors, and by adding what we have judg'd
necessary, have said, declar'd, concluded and ordain'd,
and by our present Edict, which shall be perpetual and
irrevocable, we say, declare, conclude and ordain, it
is our Will and Pleasure,</P>
<P>I. We Exhort all our Subjects, and enjoin them to
live for the future together in that Peace, Union and
Concord, which is necessary for their Preservation, and
for that of their Families, and the State, under Pain
of incurring our Indignation, and our Exemplary
Chastisement: We enjoin them also to give the Re∣spect
becoming each one, according to his Quality,
Rank, and Dignity, and to use mutually one with a∣nother
all that shall lye in them, for preventing all
Differences, Debates and Quarrels, especially those
which may be follow'd by Ways of Fact, to give each
other sincerely, and <HI>bona fide,</HI> all the right Understand∣ing
necessary, upon the Complaints and Dissatisfacti∣ons
which may happen betwixt them, to hinder
coming to Action in any way whatsoever; declaring,
that we shall repute this Proceeding for an Effect of
the Obedience which is due to us, and which we hold
to be most conformable to the Maxims of True Ho∣nour,
as well as to those of Christianity, no Person
being able to dispence himself from this mutual Cha∣rity
<PB N="36" REF="51"/>
without Action, contrary to the Commandments
of God as well as ours.</P>
<P>II. And forasmuch as there is nothing so laudable,
nor which gains more the Affections of the Publick,
and of private Persons, than to stop the Course of
Duels in their Source, We enjoin our most Dear and
Well beloved Cousins, the Marshals of <HI>France,</HI> whe∣ther
they are attending on us, or in our Provinces,
and the Governours-General of our Provinces, and in
their Absence the Lieutenants-General in the same, to
employ themselves very diligently, and with all rea∣diness,
in ending all the Differences which may hap∣pen
betwixt our Subjects, by the Ways, and, as they
are Impower'd, by the Edicts and Ordinances of the
Kings, our Predecessors. And moreover, we Impow∣er
our said Cousins to appoint in each of the Baili∣wicks
or Seneschalties of our Kingdom, one or more
Gentlemen, according to their Extent, who may be
of Quality, Age and Capacity, requisite for receiving
Informations of Differences which may happen be∣twixt
Gentlemen, Soldiers, and others of our Subjects,
to send them to our said Cousins, the Marshals of
<HI>France,</HI> or to the Eldest of them, or to the Gover∣nours-General
of our Provinces, and our Lieutenants-General
of the same, when they shall be there pre∣sent;
and we Impower the said Gentlemen who
shall be so Deputed to cause to be brought before
themselves, in the Absence of the Governours, and
our said Lieutenants-General, all those who shall have
any Difference, to bring them to an Agreement, or to
send them before our said Cousins, the Marshals of
<HI>France,</HI> in case that either of the Parties finds himself
grieved by the Agreement propos'd by the said Gen∣tlemen,
or will not submit himself to their Judg∣ments.
And when the said Governours-General of
our Provinces, and our Lieutenants-General of the
same, shall be in the Provinces, in case the Quarrels
which shall happen shall require a speedy Remedy for
Hindring what may follow, and that the Governours
are absent from the Place where the Difference shall
happen, it is our Will that the Gentlemen deputed
take Care in it at the very Instant, and cause to be
<PB N="37" REF="52"/>
Executed what is contain'd in the Articles of the
present Edict, whereof they shall give Information
at the Instant to the said Governours-General of our
Provinces; or, in their Absence, to the Lieutenants-General
in them, to labour incessantly for an Ac∣commodation:
And for this Effect we most expresly
charge all Provost Marshals, Under-Bailiffs, Under-Stewards,
their Lieutenants, Exempts, Clerks and
Officers, faithfully and readily to obey, under Pain of
Sequestration of their Offices, and Deprivation of
their Wages, the said Gentlemen deputed for the ta∣king
Cognizance of the said Differences, whether
those who Quarrel be to be Summoned, made Pri∣soners,
their Goods Seized and Estreated, or any other
necessary Acts be to be done for Hindering the Ways
of Fact, and Executing the Orders of the said Gen∣tlemen
so committed, and all at the Cost and Charges
of the Parties.</P>
<P>III. Furthermore We declare, That all who shall
be present, or shall meet, though accidentally, in the
Places where Offences against Honour shall be com∣mitted,
whereby Reports or Injurious Discourses, by
Breach of Promise, or Word past, by Giving the Lie,
Blows, or other Outrages, of what Nature soever they
be, shall be obliged for the future to give Notice of
the same to our Cousins, the Marshals of <HI>France,</HI> or
the said Governours-General of our Provinces, and
our Lieutenant-Generals in the same, or the Gentle∣men
deputed by our said Cousins, under Pain of be∣ing
reputed Complices in the said Offences, and of be∣ing
Prosecuted, as having tacitly contributed there∣unto,
for not having endeavoured to prevent the bad
Consequences of the same. It is in like manner Our
Will and Pleasure, That they who shall be acquainted
with any Beginning of Quarrels and Animosities, oc∣casioned
by Suits that are like to be intended betwixt
Gentlemen, for any Important Interest, be obliged
for the future to give Notice thereof to our said Cou∣sins,
the Marshals of <HI>France,</HI> or the Governours-Ge∣neral
of our said Provinces, and the Lieutenant-Ge∣nerals
of the same; or in their Absence, to the Gen∣tlemen
deputed in the Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liwicks, to the end they may
<PB N="38" REF="53"/>
with all their Power hinder the Parties from leaving
the ordinary Course of Civil Justice, and coming to
the Ways of Fact. And that we may be the better
informed of all the Duels and Combats that happen
in Our Provinces, We charge the Governours-General,
and Lieutenant-Generals of the same, to give Advice
to the Secretaries of State, every one in his own Pre∣cincts,
of all the Duels and Combats that shall hap∣pen
within the Limits of their Jurisdiction, to the
first Presidents of Our Courts of Parliament, and to
Our Attorneys-General in the same; in like manner to
give Advice to our dearly Beloved and Trusty, the
Sieur <HI>le Tellier,</HI> Chancellor of <HI>France,</HI> and the Gentle∣men
deputed, and Officers of the Marshalseas, to the
Marshals of <HI>France,</HI> that they may in their several
Places and Stations give Us Information of the same.
We also Command all Our Subjects to give Us Advice
thereof, by such Ways as they shall think fit, Pro∣mising
to Reward those who shall give Notice of Com∣bats
happening in the Provinces, whereof we have
received no Advice from other Hands, with the Means
of having the Proof thereof.</P>
<P>IV. When our said Cousins, the Marshals of <HI>France,</HI>
the Governours-General of Our Provinces, and Our
Lieutenants-Generals in the same, in their Absence, or
the Gentlemen deputed, shall have Information of any
Difference amongst Gentlemen, and amongst all those
that make Profession of Arms, within Our Kingdom
and Countries under Our Obedience, which proceed∣ing
from Outrageous Words, or other Causes relating
to Honour, may be like to incline them to some extra∣ordinary
Resentment, Our said Cousins, the Marshals
of <HI>France,</HI> shall forth with send express Prohibitions
to the Parties, that directly or indirectly they demand
Satisfaction of one another by the Ways of Fact, and
shall cause them to be cited to appear immediately be∣fore
them, that there they may be adjusted. And if
they apprehend that the said Parties be so incensed,
that they will not give the Respect and Deference
which they owe to their Orders, they shall presently
send them Officers and Guards of the Constabulary
and Marshalsea of <HI>Fra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> to wait upon their Persons,
<PB N="39" REF="54"/>
at the Cost and Charge of the said Parties, until they
have appeared before them; which shall be likewise
practised by the Governours-General of our Provinces,
and our Lieutenant-Generals in the same, within the
Extent of their Governments and Charges; by causing
those who have any Quarrel to be cited before them,
or sending some of their Guards or other Persons to
wait upon them, to hinder them from coming to the
Ways of Fact: And We give Power to the Gentlemen
deputed in every Bailiwick, in Absence of the Marshals
of <HI>France,</HI> Governours-General of our Provinces, and
our Lieutenant-Generals in the same, to take the same
Course with those who have Quarrels, and to make
Use of Provost-Marshals, their Lieutenants and Offi∣cers,
for the Execution of their Orders.</P>
<P>V. They who shall have Quarrels, appearing before
our Cousins, the Marshals of <HI>France,</HI> or Governours-General
of Our Provinces, and Lieutenants in the
same, or in their Absence before the said Gentlemen,
if any a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rocious Injury appear to have been committed
with Advantage, either out of a Premeditated Design
or Frolick, Our Will and Meaning is. That the Party
Offended receive so Advantageous Reparation and Sa∣tisfaction,
that he have full Cause to rest Satisfied;
Confirming, as much is needful, by this our Present
Edict, the Authority given by the Deceased Kings,
Our most Honoured Grandfather and Father, to Our
said Cousins, the Marshals of <HI>France,</HI> to Judge and
Decide, by Sovereign and Definitive Sentence, all Dif∣ferences
concerning the Point of Honour, and Repa∣ration
of Offences, whether they happen in our Court,
or any other Place of our Provinces, where they shall
be, and to the said Governours or Lieutenant-Gene∣rals,
the Power which they have also given them for
the same end, every one within the Extent of his Ju∣risdiction.</P>
<P>VI. And because sometimes Offences are committed
which so much concern Honour, that not only the Per∣sons
who receive them are thereby Injured, but also
the Respect that is due to our Laws and Ordinances
manifestly Violated: We will that those who shall
commit such like Offences, besides the Satisfactions
<PB N="40" REF="55"/>
Ordained in Regard of the Persons Offended, be like∣wise
Condemned by the said Judges of the Point of
Honour▪ to suffer Imprisonments, Banishments and
Fines. Considering also, That there is nothing more
Unreasonable, or contrary to the Profession of Honour,
than the Outrage that may be committed upon Occa∣sion
of some Civil Interest, or some Law-suit com∣menc'd
before the Ordinary Judges: It is our Will
and Pleasure, that in the Accommodations of Offences,
proceeding from such Causes, the said Judges of the
Point of Honour use all the Rigour that they shall
think reasonable for the Satisfaction of the Party Of∣fended;
and that for the Reparation of our Authori∣ty,
thereby Wounded, they Ordain either Imprison∣ment
during the space of Three Months, or less, or
Banishment for so long Time from the Places where the
Offender has his Residence, or the Loss of One or Two
Years Revenue of the Matter disputed.</P>
<P>VII. Seeing many Differences happen amongst Gen∣tlemen,
because of Hunting, honorary Rights of
Churches, and other Preheminences of Mannors and
Lordships, as being nearly related to the Point of Ho∣nour;
Our Will and Pleasure is, That our said Cou∣sins,
the Marshals of <HI>France,</HI> the Governours of our
Provinces, and our Lieutenants in the same, and the
Gentlemen deputed in the said Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liwicks, or Stewar∣ties,
use their utmost Endeavours to oblige the Par∣ties
to agree upon Arbitrators, who may with them
judge summarily without Formalities the Ground of
such like Differences, reserving still the Right of Ap∣peal
to our Courts of Parliament, when one of the
Parties shall find himself Wronged by the Verdict of
the Arbitrators.</P>
<P>VIII. In case a Gentleman refuse, or without law∣ful
Cause delay, to obey the Orders of our Cousins, the
Marshals of <HI>France,</HI> or of the other Judges of the Point
of Honour, as not to appear before them, when he hath
been cited either Personally, or at his Dwelling-House▪
and also when he hath not submitted to the Banish∣ment
imposed upon him, he shall forthwith be Forced
to it, after a certain Time prescribed to him by the
said Judges, either by a Gar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ison put into his House<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="41" REF="56"/>
or by the Imprisonment of his Person: Which shall
be carefully put in Execution by the Provosts of our
said Cousins, the Marshals of <HI>France,</HI> Under-Bailiffs,
Under-Stewards, their Lieutenants, Exempts and Of∣ficers,
upon Pain of Sequestration of their Offices, and
Loss of their Wages, according to the Ordinances of
the said Judges; and the said Execution shall be made
at the Cost and Charges of the Disobedient and Refra∣ctory
Party. And if the said Provosts, Under-Bailiffs,
Under Stewards, their Lieutenants▪ Exempts and Of∣ficers,
cannot execute the said Imprisonment, they
shall Seize and Estreat all the Revenues of the said Ba∣nished
or Disobedient Person, to be applied, and re∣main
as acquired during the whole Time of his Diso∣bedience;
to wit, one half to the Hospital of the
Town where there is a Parliament Established, and
the other to the Hospitals of the Place where there is
a Royal Seat, under the Jurisdiction of which Parlia∣ment,
or Royal Seat, the Goods of the said Banished
or Disobedient Person shall be; to the End, that mu∣tually
assisting one another in the Prosecution, the one
may supply the Advice and Proof, and the other in∣terpose
our Authority by that of Justice, for the Effect
of our Intention. And in Case there be preceding
Debts that hinder the Uplifting of the said Revenue,
applicable to the Profit of the said Hospitals, the Sum
to which it amounts shall be charged as a Debt upon
all the Chattels of the Party Banished, to be pay'd
and discharged in Course from the Day of the Sen∣tence
pass'd against him.</P>
<P>IX. Moreover, we Ordain that those who have
been put under the Guards of our Cousins, the Mar∣shals
of <HI>France,</HI> the Governours-General of our Pro∣vinces,
and our Lieutenants in the same, or of the
said Gentlemen deputed, and who shall make their E∣scape
in what Manner soever, shall be severely Punish∣ed,
and not admitted to Accommodation upon the
Point of Honour, till those that have been Guilty of
the said Escape or Breach of Guard have been put in
Prison, and at the Instance of our Proctor in the Con∣stabulary,
and of the Substitutes of the other Marshal∣seas
of <HI>France,</HI> proceeded against according to the Forms
<PB N="42" REF="57"/>
required by our Ordinances. It is our Will and Plea∣sure,
That upon the Information or Report of the
Guards that have been appointed to keep them, with∣out
any other Information, they be sentenced at the
Instance of the said Substitutes, and their Process sum∣marily
made.</P>
<P>X. Though the Care we take of the Honour of our
Nobility sufficiently appears by the Contents of the
foregoing Articles, and by our solicitous Search of the
Means that are esteemed the most proper for stifling
Quarrels in their Birth, and laying upon those who
Offend the Blame and Shame which they deserve;
being nevertheless apprehensive that some may still be
so Bold as to contravene our Will and Pleasure so ex∣presly
Declared, and presume that they have Reason to
seek to Revenge themselves, We Will and Command,
that he, who thinking himself injured, shall give a
Challenge to any Man upon his own Account, shall for
ever forfeit his Right of obtaining Satisfaction for the
Offence that he may pretend to have received, be kept
in Prison for the space of Two Years, and condemned
in a Fine to the Hospital of the Town next to the Place
of his Abode, which is not to be of less Value than the
half of one Year's Rent of his Estate, and besides, that
he be suspended from all his Offices, and deprived of
the Profit of them for Three Years. We permit
all Judges to heighten the said Penalties according as
the Conditions of the Persons, the Grounds of the
Quarrels, as Suits commenced, or other Civil Interests,
the Prohibitions violated, or Escapes made, the Cir∣cumstances
of Places and Times, shall render the Chal∣lenge
more Punishable. And if he that is Challenged,
instead of refusing the Challenge, and of giving Notice
of it to our Cousins, the Marshals of <HI>France,</HI> or to the
Governours-General of our Provinces, and our Lieu∣tenants
in the same, or to the Gentlemen deputed, as
we do enjoin him to do, go to the Place assigned, or
Attempts to do so, he be Punished with the same Pe∣nalties
of the Challenger. Furthermore, it is our
Pleasure, That they who shall Challenge for another,
or shall accept a Challenge, without having informed
of it before, be Punished with the same Penalties.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="58"/>
XI. And for so much that besides the Punishment
that those who Challenge ought to Incur, there are
some who deserve to be doubly Chastized and Repres∣sed,
as when they Attack those who are their Benefa∣ctors,
Superiors, and Lords, or Persons of Command,
and raised by the Quality of their Charges, and especi∣ally
when the Quarrels arise for Actions of Obedience,
to which an Inferiour Condition, Charge or Employ∣ment,
hath subjected them, or for the Corrections
which they have undergone by their Authority, who
have the Power to impose them upon them: Consider∣ing
that there is nothing more necessary for the main∣taining
of Discipline, especially amongst those who
make Profession of Arms, than Respect towards those
who Command them: We Will and Command, That
they who shall break out into that Excess, and more
particularly they who Challenge their Officers or O∣thers,
who have the Right to Command them, shall be
kept in Prison for the space of Four Years, deprived
of the Exercise of their Charges during the said Time,
with the Pay and Salary due to them, which shall be
given to the Hospital-general of the next Town; and
in case it be an Inferior against his Superior or Lord,
he shall be kept in Prison during the said Four Years,
and shall be condemned in a Fine which cannot be
less than a Year's Rent: Expresly charging our said
Cousins, the Marshals of <HI>France,</HI> Governours-General
of our Provinces, and the Lieutenant-Generals in the
same, and the Gentlemen deputed, and especially the
Generals of our Armies, wherein that Disorder may
be more frequent than any where else, to see to the
sever<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and exact Execution of the present Article. And
if the Superior Officers or Lords who have been Chal∣lenged
receive the Challenge, and put themselves in a
Condition of Satisfying the Challengers, they shall be
Punished with the same Penalties of Imprisonment,
Sequestration of their Charges and Revenues of the
same, and Fines above specified, not to be dispensed
therefrom, whatever Instances and Supplications they
may make to us for that Effect.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="59"/>
XII. And forasmuch as we are resolv'd to Cashier
and Turn Out of Place all who shall be found Guilty
of the said Crime, and that Notoriously, if they who
have been so Cashiered and Turned Out of Place re∣sent
it against those whom we shall Prefer to the same,
by Challenging, or Provoking them to Fight, either
by themselves or others, in Re-encounter, or other∣wise,
We Will that they, and those whom they
have made use of, be Imprisoned for the space of Six
Years, and Condemned in a Fine of Six Years Rent of
their Estates, without any Hopes of ever being Relea∣sed
from the said Penalties: And generally that they
who shall a Second Time violate our present Edict, as
Challengers, and more particularly they who have
made use of Seconds to carry their Challenges, be
Punished with the same Pains of Imprisonment, Loss
of Places, and Fines, though no Combat ensued upon
it.</P>
<P>XIII. If contrary to the Prohibitions of this our
present Edict the Challenger and Challenged do actu∣ally
Fight, We Will and Ordain, That though there
be none either Wounded or Killed, yet they shall be
proceeded against Criminally and Extraordinarily;
that they be without Pardon Punished with Death,
that all their Goods, Real and Personal, be confisca∣ted
to us, a Third of them applicable to the Hospital
of the Town where the parliament is, in the Jurisdi∣ction
whereof the Crime hath been committed, and
jointly to the Hospital of the Royal Seat next to the
Place of the Fact; and the Two other Thirds, as well
for the Charges of the Apprehension and Execution
of Justice, as to what the Judges shall think equitable
to adjudge to the Wives and Children, if any there
be, for their Subsistence and Entertainment only du∣ring
their Lives. And if the Crime be committed in
the Provinces where Confiscation has no Place, it is
our Will and Pleasure, That instead of the said Con∣fiscation,
a Fine be set upon the Goods of the Crimi∣nals,
to the Profit of the said Hospitals, which is not
to be less than the half of the Goods of the Criminals.
We Command and Charge our Proctors - General,
their Substitutes, and those who have the Administra∣tion
<PB N="45" REF="60"/>
of the said Hospitals, to make careful Search and
Prosecutions for the said Sums and Confiscations, for
the which their Action shall continue during the time
and space of Twenty Years, though they should even
make no Prosecution that might Prorogue it, the
which Sums and Confiscations shall not be Remitted
nor Diverted upon any Cause or Pretext whatsoever.
And if one or both the Duellers be Killed, We Will
and Command that the Criminal Process be made a∣gainst
the Memory of the Dead, as against those who
are Guilty of Treason against God and Man; and that
their Bodies be deprived of Burial; Prohibiting all
Curates, their Vicars, and other Church-men, to Interr
them, nor suffer them to be Interred in Consecrated
Ground: Confiscating besides, as above, all their
Goods, Real and Personal. And as to the Surviver
who hath Killed, besides the abovementioned Confis∣cation
of all his Goods, or the Fine amounting to one
half of the same in the Countries where Confiscation
hath no Place, he shall unpardonably be Punished with
Death, according to the Disposition of the Ordi∣nances.</P>
<P>XIV.
The Goods of him that hath been Killed, and
of the Surviver, shall be disposed of by the Admini∣strators
of the Hospitals during the Prosecution of the
Action for Duelling, and the Revenues applied to the
defraying the Costs of Suit.</P>
<P>XV. Though we hope that our Prohibitions, and
the Penalties so justly appointed against Duels, will
keep all our Subjects for the future from falling into
them, nevertheless if any should still be so rash as to
dare to contravene our Will and Pleasure, not only
in doing themselves Justice, but besides in engaging
also in their Quarrels and Resentments, Seconds,
Thirds, or a greater Number of Persons, which can∣not
be done by a crafty Cowardice, which makes
those who are sensible of their own Weakness seek
for the Safety they need in the Skill and Courage of
others: We Will, that they who shall be found
guilty of so Criminal and Case a Contravention of
our present Edict, be without Remis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion punished
with Death, though no Man should be Wounded or
<PB N="46" REF="61"/>
Hurt in the Duels; that all their Goods be Confiscated
as before, that they be degraded, from Nobility, and
declared Ignoble, uncapable for ever of holding any
Place; their Arms defaced and publickly borne by the
Executioner of High Justice. We enjoin their Suc∣cessors
to change their Arms, and take a New Coat,
for which they shall obtain our Letters for that Effect;
and in case they resume the same Arms, they shall of
new be defaced, and borne by the Publick Executioner,
and they condemned in the Fine of Two Years Rent
of their Estates, one half applicable to the Hospital-General
of the next Town, and the other half at the
Pleasure of the Judges. And seeing no Chastisement
can be great enough to punish those who engage up∣on
so slight an Account, and so criminally in the Re∣sentment
of an Affront wherein they have no Con∣cern,
and which they ought rather endeavour to ad∣just
for the Preservation and Satisfaction of their
Friends, than to pursue the Revenge of it by Ways
that are as far from true Valour and Courage, as they
are from Charity and Christian Friendship, it is our
Will, That all who fall into the Crime of being Se∣conds,
Thirds, or other Numbers, be alike punished
with the same Penalties which we have appointed
for those that shall Employ them.</P>
<P>XVI. Forasmuch as there are some of Base Birth,
and who have never carried Arms, who are neverthe∣less
so Insolent as to Challenge Gentlemen, who be∣cause
of the Difference of their Conditions refusing to
do them Reason, the same Persons stir up other Gen∣tlemen
against those whom they have Challenged,
whence sometimes Murders follow; so much the
more Detestable, as that they proceed from an abject
Cause: We Will and Command, that in Case of such
Challenges and Combats, especially if they be attend∣ed
with any great Wound or Death, the said ignoble
Fellows who shall be duly attaint and convicted of
having caused and promoted such Disorders, without
Remission be Hanged all their Goods, Moveable,
and Immoveable, Confiscated, Two Thirds to the
Hospitals of the Places, or of the next adjacent, and
the other Third employed for the Charges of the
<PB N="47" REF="62"/>
Trial, for the Maintenance of the Widows and Chil∣dren
of the Deceased, if any there be: With Power
besides to the Judges of the said Crimes to appoint
of the Goods Confiscated, such Recompence as they
shall think reasonable to the Informer, and other Dis∣coverers
of the said Case, to the End that in so punish∣able
a Crime every one may be invited to the inform∣ing
of it. And as to the Gentlemen who have so
fought for Unworthy Causes, and against Ignoble
Persons, We Will that they suffer the same Punish∣ments
that we have appointed against Seconds, if they
can be Apprehended; if not, they shall be proceeded
against upon Default and Contumacy according to
the Rigour of the Ordinances.</P>
<P>XVII. We Will that all who shall knowingly carry
Challenges, or attend to the Places of Duels, or Ren∣counters,
as Lackeys, or other Servants, shall be
whipt and stigmatized for the first Fault; and if they
relapse into the same Fault, sent to the Galleys for
ever. And for those who have been Spectators of a
Duel, if they have gone purposely for that Effect,
We Will that they be for ever deprived of the Places,
Dignities, and Pensions, which they possess; and if
they have no Places, that a Fourth Part of their
Goods be Confiscated, and applied to Hospitals; and
if the Fact be committed in any Province where Con∣fiscation
hath no Place, that they be condemned in a
Fine for the Profit of the said Hospitals, which is not
to be less Worth than the Fourth Part of the Goods
of the said Spectators, whom with Reason we repute
Accomplices of so Detestable a Crime, seeing they
assist at it, and hinder not the same as much as they
can, to which by the Laws of God and Man they are
obliged.</P>
<P>XVIII. And forasmuch as it hath frequently hap∣pened
that for avoiding the Rigour of the Penalties by
so many Edicts appointed for Duels, many have
sought for Occasions of Rencountering: We Will and
Command, that they who pretend to have re∣ceived
any Offence, and have not given Notice of it to
the said Judges of the Point of Honour, and who
shall engage upon Rencounter, or Fight Singly, or in
<PB N="48" REF="63"/>
an equal State and Number, with alike Arms on each
Side, on Foot, or on Horseback, be subject to the
same Punishments as if it had been a Duel. And be∣cause
there have been also some of our Subjects, who
having qua<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>relled within our Dominions, and having
met to Fight without them, or upon our Frontiers,
have thought that by that Means they might evade
the Effect of our Edicts: We Will that all who
shall do so be pursued criminally, if they can be taken;
if not, upon Contumacies; and that they be Con∣demned
to the same Punishment, and their Goods
Confiscated, as if they had contravened the present
Edict within the Bounds, and not withdrawing out
of our Provinces, judging them so much the more
Criminal and Punishable; that the first Emotions in
the Heat and Newness of the Offence can no more
excuse them; and that they have had Time enough
to moderate their Resentment, and abstain from so
prohibited a Revenge, no Place being left for those
concerned in the Cases mentioned in this present Arti∣cle
to alledge Chance or Accident, to which we charge
our Judges to have no Respect.</P>
<P>XIX. And to prevent that so Holy a Law, and so
Profitable to our State, become not useless to the Pub∣lick,
for Fault of Observation thereof, We most ex∣presly
Enjoin and Command our Cousins, the Mar∣shals
of <HI>France,</HI> to whom, under Our Authority, be∣longs
the Cognizance and Decision of Contests and
Quarrels that concern the Honour and Reputation of
our Subjects, diligently and exactly to see to the Ex∣ecution
of our Present Edict, without Remitting any
thing in it, or Permitting that by Favour, Conni∣vance,
or any other Way, it be in any manner Contra∣vened.
And that our said Cousins, the Marshals of
<HI>France,</HI> may have the more Means and Power to hinder
and repress that Unbridled Licen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iousness of Duels
and Rencounters; considering besides, that Diligence
is of great Importance for the Punishment of such
Crimes; and that the Provosts of Our said Cousins, the
Marshals, the Under-Bailiffs, Under-Stewards, and
Lieutenants-Criminal of the Short Robe, are most
commonly on Horseback for our Service, that they
<PB N="49" REF="64"/>
may be the readier and more proper for Proceeding
against the Guilty of Duels and Rencounters, We have
of new Assigned the Execution of the Present Edict,
as well within as without the Precincts of Towns, to
the Officers of the Constabulary and Marshalsea of
<HI>France,</HI> Provosts-General of the said Constabulary of
the Isle of <HI>France</HI> and the <HI>Mints,</HI> and all other Pro∣vosts-General,
Provincial and Particular, Under-Bai∣liffs,
and Under-Stewards, and Lieutenants-Criminal
of the Short Robe, in Concurrence with Our Ordi∣nary
Judges, and with <HI>proviso</HI> of an Appeal to Our
Courts of Parliament, to whose Jurisdiction it ought
to belong, notwithstanding all Declarations and Edicts
Prohibiting the said Provosts to take Cognizance of
Duels and Rencounters to the contrary.</P>
<P>XX. The Judges and other Officers who shall Sup∣press
and Change the Informations shall be turned
out of their Places, and punished as Forgers.</P>
<P>XXI. And forasmuch as it frequently enough hap∣pens
that the said Provosts, Under-Bailiffs, Under-Stewards
and Lieutenant-Criminals of the Short Robe,
are Negligent in Executing the Orders of Our said
Cousins, the Marshals of <HI>France,</HI> We Will and Com∣mand,
That if the said Officers fail to Obey the first
Command of Our said Cousins, the Marshals, or of
One of them, or of the other Judges of the Point of
Honour, in Summoning those who Quarrel to appear
at the Day appointed, and in Seizing and Arresting
them in case of Refusal and Disobedience; and finally,
in Executing punctually, and all Affairs laid aside,
what shall be Enjoined and Commanded them by our
said Cousins, the Marshals of <HI>France,</HI> and Judges of the
Point of Honour, they be by our said Cousins Punish∣ed
and Chastised for their Negligences by Suspension
from their Places, and Deprivation of their Salaries,
which may be really Attached and Seized, upon the
bare Order of Our said Cousins, the Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hals of <HI>France,</HI>
or of one of them, signified to the Treasurer in Ordi∣nary
of our Wars who, shall be in Duty Personally, or
at his Dwelling-House. Furthermore, We Command
the said Provosts, Under-Bailiffs, Under-Stewards,
their Lieutenants and Officers, in their several Juris∣dictions,
<PB N="50" REF="65"/>
upon the same Penalties of Suspension and
Deprivation of Salary, that upon the Report of a
Combat fought they forthwith go to the Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ces to
Arrest the Guilty, and make them Prisoners in the
Royal Prisons next to the Place where the Fact is
Committed, Ordaining, That for every Seisure they
be paid the Sum of 1500 Livres, to be raised with the
other Charges of Suit upon the readiest Goods of the
Guilty, and preferrably to the Confiscations and Fines
which we have before imposed.</P>
<P>XXII. And seeing the Guilty, to avoid falling into
the Hands of Justice, commonly fly to the Houses of
the Great Men of Our Kingdom, We most expresly
and strictly Forbid all Persons, of what Quality and
Condition soever they be, to receive within their
Houses any who have contravened this our Present
Edict. And in case any be found who give them
Sanctuary, and refuse to deliver them up unto the Hands
of Justice, so soon as they shall be required to it, We Will
that the Informations thereof, duly taken and drawn
up by the said Provosts, of the Marshals and other
Judges, be forthwith and instantly sent to the Secreta∣ries
of State, according to their several Offices, as also
the Attorneys-General of our Courts of Parliament,
and to our said Cousins, the Marshals, to the end that
having consulted with them, we may command a ri∣gorous
Prosecution of those who protect so Criminal
Disorders.</P>
<P>XXIII. But if notwithstanding the Care and Dili∣gence
prescribed by the preceeding Articles, the Credit
and Authority of the Parties interessed in these Crimes
divert the Proofs of them by Threats or Artifice, We
Will that upon the bare Requisition made by our
Attorneys<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>General, or their Substitutes, Monitories be
Decreed by the Officials of the Bishops of the Places,
which shall be Published and Thundered according to
Canonical Form against those who refuse to come and
declare what they know concerning Duels and Ren∣counters
that have happened. We further Command,
that for the future our Attorneys-General in our
Courts of Parliament, and their Substitutes, upon
Notice given them of Combats that have been fought,
<PB N="51" REF="66"/>
shall make their Requisitions against those, who by No∣toriety
shall be judged guilty of them, and that accord∣ing
thereunto our said Courts, without other Proofs,
order, That within the Time that they shall think fit,
they be obliged to render themselves Prisoners for Ju∣stifying
themselves, and Answering upon the Requi∣sitions
of Our said Attorneys-General: And if within
the said Time they fail to Obey the Orders that are
intimated to them at their Dwelling-houses, We will
have them proceeded against upon Default and Con∣tumacy,
be Declared and Convicted of the Crimes ob∣jected
to them; and as such, that they be Condemned
in the Penalties mentioned by Our Edicts, and their
Goods Acquired Confiscated to Us, and put into
Our Hands, without waiting until the Five Years of
Defaults and Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umacies be Expired, that all their
Houses be Rased, and their Woods of high Growth
cut off to a certain Height, according to the Orders
we shall give, and themselves, declared Infamous, and
Degraded from Nobility, being for the future incapa∣ble
of any Place or Office. We forbid all Our Courts
of Parliament, and Our other Judges, to admit them
to their Justification after the Sentences of Condemna∣tion,
ever during the Five Years of Contumacy, till
first they have Obtained Our Letters, allowing them
Permission to appear, and have pay'd the Fines in
which they have been Condemned, and that notwith∣standing
the Eighteenth Article of the Seventh Title of
Our Criminal Ordinance, which We have dispensed
and do dispense with in that respect, without being
drawn into Consequence.</P>
<P>XXIV. And even when the Suspected have been Ar∣rested,
and put in Prison, or that they have delivered
themselves into Prison, We Will, That in case Our
Attorneys-General find it difficult to make out the
Proofs of the said Combats▪ Our Courts give them
the Delays which they shall require, referring it to the
Honour and Conscience of Our said Attorneys-Gene∣ral,
not to make use of them but for the Good of
Justice.</P>
<P>XXV. During the Time that the Parties Accused
or Suspected of the said Crimes do not render them∣selves
<PB N="52" REF="67"/>
Prisoners▪ We Will, That the Jurisdiction of
their Lands be Executed in Our Name; and during
the said Time We will provide to the <HI>Offices</HI> and Be∣nefices
of which the Disposition belongs to the said
Parties Accused or Suspected.</P>
<P>XXVI. And to prevent that during the Time of the
Trials upon Defaults and Contumacies the Parties
Suspected may not make use of the Means which they
usually practise for taking off the Proofs of their
Crimes, by Terrifying the Witnesses, or Obliging
them to Retract when they come to Swear; it is Our
Will and Pleasure, that not withstanding the Third
Article of the Fifteenth Title of Our Ordinance of the
Month of <HI>August,</HI> 1650, with which we have dis∣pensed,
and do dispense, upon this Account of the
Crime of Duels only, the Officers of Our Courts, and
the Lieutenants-Criminal of Bailiwicks, where there is
a Presidial Seat, may proceed to the Examination of
Witnesses within the Twenty and Four Hours, and as
soon as may b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, after they have been heard in the In∣formations,
and that before any Judgment that Or∣dains
it hath past, though the Examinations must not
stand instead of Confrontation till it hath been so
ordained by the Judgment of Default and Contuma∣cy.</P>
<P>XXVII.
We declare those that are Condemned up∣on
Contumacy incapable and unworthy of all Suc∣cessions
that may fall to them after their Condemna∣tion,
though they be within the Five Years, and that
they were afterwards Restored notwithstanding their
Contumacy. If the Successions fall before the Restau∣ration,
the Lordship and Jurisdiction of the Land<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
shall be Executed in our Name, and the Fruits assigned
to the Hospitals, without Hopes of Restitution, to be
counted from the Day of the Condemnation upon
Contumacy.</P>
<P>XXVIII. We Will and Command in like manner,
That in the Places remote from Towns where our
Courts of Parliament Sit, that when after all the a∣forementioned
Searches and Perquisitions the Guilty
of Duels and Rencounters cannot be found, at the de∣sire
of the Substitutes of our Attorneys-General, upon
<PB N="53" REF="68"/>
the bare Notoriety of Fact Seizure be Decreed against
the Absent, and for Fault of being able to apprehend
them by Virtue of that Decree, all their Goods be Seiz∣ed,
and that they be cited to appear within Three
short Terms consecutively; and that thereupon the
Defaults shall be put into the Hands of our Attorneys-General,
or their Substitutes, that the Profit of them
may be adjudged without other Form or Figure of
Process within Eight Days after the Crime commit∣ted,
and without any Obligation upon our said Attor∣neys-General▪
or their Substitutes, to Inform and make
Proof of the Notoriety.</P>
<P>XXIX. When the Accusation is for the Crime of
Duelling, no Regulation of the Judges can be made,
notwithstanding all Pretext of Prevention, Assassina∣tion,
or otherwise, and the Process cannot be pur∣sued,
but before the Judges of the Crime of Duel∣ling.</P>
<P>XXX.
And to prevent the Surprizes of those, who
to obtain Pardons may disguise to us the Truth of
Combats that have happened, and alledge False Mat∣ters
of Fact, to make it be believed that the said Com∣bats
happened unexpectedly, and in Consequence of a
Quarrel arising on the Spot: We Ordain, That no
Man can carry through the Seals the Grant of any
Pardon in Cases where there is Suspicion of a Preme∣ditated
Duel or Rencounter, unless he be actually a
Prisoner in our Retinue, or at least in the chief Prison
of the Parliament, in the Jurisdiction whereof the
Combat hath been Fought: and unless it hath been
verified that he hath in no manner contravened this
our present Edict; so that having thereupon taken the
Advice of our Cousins, the Marshals of <HI>France,</HI> We
may grant him a Remission with knowledge of the
Cause.</P>
<P>XXXI. And forasmuch as in pursuance of our Or∣ders,
our Cousins, the Marshals of <HI>France,</HI> are assem∣bled
to Review and Examine of new the Regulation
made by them concerning the several Satisfactions and
Reparations of Honour, to which, by Orders from us,
they have added more severe Punishments against the
Aggressors; it is our Will and Pleasure, That the
<PB N="54" REF="69"/>
said New Regulation, Dated the 22d of this present
Month, together with that of the 22d of <HI>August,</HI>
1653, hereto annexed under the Counter-Seal of our
Chancellery, be inviolably followed and observed for
the future by all those that shall be employed in ad∣justing
Differences which concern the Point of Honour
and Reputation of Gentlemen.</P>
<P>XXXII. And in respect that sometimes the Admi∣nistrators
of Hospitals have neglected to recover the
said Fines and Confiscations, We Will, That the Re∣covery
of Fines and Confiscations, adjudged to the said
Hospitals, and other Persons, who have been Negligent
for the space of a Year, to be counted from the Day
of the Sentences of Condemnation, be made by the
Receiver-General of our Revenues, to whom the half
of the said Confiscations and Fines shall belong, for
the Charges of the Recovery, reserving to ourself to
dispose of the other half in Favours of what Hospi∣tals
we please, besides that to which they have been
adjudged.</P>
<P>XXXIII. It is moreover our Will and Pleasure,
That when Gentlemen have not obeyed the Orders of
the Marshals of <HI>France,</HI> and that they have incurred the
Fines and Confiscations appointed by this present E∣dict,
and the Regulation of the Marshals of <HI>France,</HI>
Advice of it shall forthwith be given by the said Mar∣shals
of <HI>France</HI> to our Attorneys-General in our Courts
of Parliament, or to their Substitutes, whom we en∣join
immediately to proceed to the Seizure of Goods,
until the said Gentlemen do Obey; and in case they
Obey not within Three Months, the Fruits shall be
purely applied to Hospitals, until they have Obeyed.
the Charges of Provosts, of Procedure, Guards and
others, being first Defalcated; and for that Effect
We Will, That the Directors and Administrators of the
said Hospitals be put in Possession and actual Enjoy∣ment
of the said Goods. We Enjoin our said At∣torneys-General,
and their Substitutes, to join with
the said Directors and Administrators for the speedy
and real uplifting of the said Fines. We especially
Charge the Judges to have no Respect to Contracts▪
<PB N="55" REF="70"/>
Wills and Testaments, nor other Acts made within
Six Months before the Crimes committed.</P>
<P>XXXIV. When any one shall happen to be Killed in
Combats, We permit the Relations of the Deceased to
become Party within Three Months for longest delay
against him who hath Killed; and in case he be Con∣victed
of the Crime, Condemned and Executed, We
make over the Confiscation of the Deceased to the
Profit of him that hath pursued, who shall not be ob∣liged
to obtain another Grant of the Gift besides this
present Edict. As to the Relations to whose Profit
We have made over the Confiscation, We Will that
the nearest of Kin be Preferred before the more Re∣mote,
Provided they have made themselves Parties
within the Three Months, upon Condition of Reim∣bursing
the Charges that have been laid out.</P>
<P>XXXV. The Crime of Duelling cannot be extin∣guished
neither by Death, nor by any Prescription of
Twenty or Thirty Years, nor by any other, unless Exe∣cution,
Condemnation, or Complaint, have been made;
and it may be Prosecuted after any Lapse of Time
whatsoever against the Party, or against his Memory▪
Nay, those who shall be found Guilty of Duelling
since our Edict of 1651, Registred in our Court of Par∣liament
of <HI>Paris,</HI> in the Month of <HI>September</HI> the same
Year, may be called to an Account for the other Crimes
committed by them before or since, notwithstanding
the said Prescription of Twenty and Thirty Years, pro∣vided
they be at the same Time tried for the Crime of
Duelling, and by the same Judges, and that they be
Convicted of the same.</P>
<P>XXXVI. All the Penalties contained in the present
Edict for Punishment of the Contraveners of our
Will and Pleasure would be Useless, and of no Effect,
if by the Motives of an inflexible Justice and Steadfast∣ness
we maintained not the Laws which we have E∣stablished.
For that End We Swear and Promise in
the Faith and Word of a King, not to exempt for the
future any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erson, for any Cause or Consideration
whatsoever, from the Rigour of the present Edict, that
no Remission, Pardon and Obolition shall be granted
<PB N="56" REF="71"/>
by us to those who shall be guilty of the said Crimes
of Duels and Rencounters. We most strictly Charge
all Princes and Lords about us not to make any Inter∣cessions
for those that are guilty of the said Crimes,
upon Pain of Incurring our Indignation. Protesting
again, That neither in Favours of any Marriage of a
Prince or Princess of our Blood, nor for the Birth of
Princes or Children of <HI>France,</HI> which may happen du∣ring
our Reign, nor for any Consideration General and
Particular that may be, we will not knowingly suffer
any Grants to be expeded contrary to our present Will,
the Execution whereof we have Expresly and Solemn∣ly
Sworn upon the Day of our Coronation, to the
End so Christian, Just and Necessary, a Law may be
rendred more Authentick and Inviolable. We Charge
and Command our Trusty and Beloved Councellors,
those that hold our Court of Parliament, that they
cause these Presents to be Read, Published and Regi∣stred,
and the Contents thereof Inviolably Kept and
Observed, without Contravening, or permitting them
to be Contravened; for such is our Pleasure. And
that it may be a Thing for ever Firm and Stable, We
have caused our Seal to be put to these Presents. Given
at St. <HI>German</HI> in <HI>Laye</HI> in the Month of <HI>August,</HI> One
Thousand Six Hundred Seventy Nine, and Thirty-seventh
Year of our Reign. Sign'd, <HI>LOVIS,</HI> and

<PB N="57" REF="72"/>
<HEAD>A Regulation made by the Marshals of France
concerning the several Satisfactions and Re∣parations
of Honour, <DATE>August 22. 1653.</DATE></HEAD>
<P><HI>AS to what we are Commanded by express Orders
from the King, and particularly by his Majesty's
Declaration against Duels, Read, Published and Regi∣stred,
in the Parliament of</HI> Paris, <HI>the 29th of</HI> July <HI>last,</HI>
That we should instantly Meet to frame a Regulation, the
most Exact and Distinct that may be, concerning the vari∣ous
Satisfactions and Reparations of Honour, which we
shall judge ought to be appointed according to the Diffe∣rent
Degrees of Offences: And in such a Manner that
the Punishment of the Aggressor, and the Satisfaction of
the Party Offended, be so great and so proportionable to
the Injury Received, That no new Complaint nor Quarrel
may rise upon that Account: The said Regulation to be In∣violably
followed and observed for the Future by all
those who shall be employed in adjusting of Differences
concerning the Point of Honour and Reputation of Gentle∣men.
<HI>We having seen and examined the Propositions
of several Gentlemen of Quality of this Kingdom,
who have had divers Conferences together upon this
Subject, in pursuance of the Orders they had from us
of the first of</HI> July 1651. <HI>and who have presented in
our Assembly the said Propositions, drawn up in Wri∣ting,
and signed with their Hands, after mature Deli∣beration
We have Concluded and Agreed upon the
following Articles.</HI></P>
<P>I. In the First Place, That in all Occasions and Sub∣jects
that may cause Quarrels and Resentments, no
Gentleman ought to think it Inconsistent with Honour
to do any thing that may give a clear and sincere Ex∣planation
of the Truth.</P>
<P>II. That amongst Gentlemen, many having alrea∣dy
solemnly Protested, and in Writing, that they will
refuse all Challenges, and never Fight a Duel for any
Cause whatsoever: These are so much the more obli∣ged
to give a clear Understanding, that without it
they would formally Contravene their own Wri∣ting,
<PB N="58" REF="73"/>
and by consequent, the more deserve Reproof and
Chastisement in the adjusting of Quarrels that may
arise for want of a clear Understanding.</P>
<P><HI>But if he that pretends himself to be offended has
so little Reason as not to be satisfied with the Ex∣planation
that hath been fairly and sincerely given
him, and that he will oblige him by whom he thinks
himself affronted, to Fight him: He who hath re∣nounced
Duelling may Answer him to this, or the
like Purpose:</HI> That he wonders very much, that know∣ing
the last Edicts of the King, and particularly the De∣claration
of several Gentlemen, wherein he hath publickly
engaged himself not to Fight, he will not rest satisfied
with the clear Ʋnderstanding that he gives him: And
that he considers not, that he neither can, nor ought to give
or receive any Place for Fighting, nay, nor to tell him
where be may Rencounter him, but that he will change no∣thing
in his ordinary Course of Life. <HI>And generally all
other Gentlemen may Answer,</HI> That if they be set up∣on
they will defend themselves, but that they think not
themselves obliged in Honour to Fight in Cold Blood, and
so formally to contravene his Majesty's Edicts, the Laws
of Religion, and their own Conscience.</P>
<P>IV. When there happens any Quarrel amongst Gen∣tlemen,
of whom some have promised under Hand∣writing
not to Fight, and the others not, These
latter shall always be reputed Aggressors, if the con∣trary
appear not by evident Proof.</P>
<P>V. And because the Ways of Fact might easily be
prevented, if we, the Governours, or Lieutenant-Generals
of Provinces were carefully informed of all
the Causes and Beginnings of Quarrels, We have con∣sulted
and agreed, conform to the Power given us by
his Majesty's la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Edict, registred in Parliament, the
King sitting there, the 7th of <HI>September,</HI> 1651, forth∣with
to name and depute in every Bailiwick and
Stewardy of this Kingdom, one or more Gentlemen
of Quality, Age, and requisite Sufficiency for receiv∣ing
the Intelligences of the Differences of Gentlemen,
and for sendi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g them to us, or to the Governours and
Lieutenant-Generals of Provinces, when they are re∣sident
<PB N="59" REF="74"/>
there; and for doing all Things in General
that are prescribed by the Second Article of the said
Edict.</P>
<P>And in Conformity to the same Edict, we charge
all our Provosts, Under-Bailiffs, Under-Stewards,
Lieutenants-Criminal of the Short Robe, and other
Officers of Marshalseas, readily and faithfully to obey
the said Gentlemen deputed, for the Execution of
their Orders.</P>
<P>VI. And to the End we may be the more carefully
informed of the Differences of Gentlemen, we declare,
according to the Third Article of the same Edict,
That all, who shall meet, though accidentally, in the
Places where Offences are given, either by Reports,
Injurious Discourses, or Words, or by giving the Lie,
Threats, Blows, Cudgellings, or other Outrages a∣gainst
Honour, of what Nature soever they be, shall
for the future be obliged to give us Notice of the
same, or the Governours, or Lieutenant-Generals of
Provinces, or the Gentlemen deputed, upon Pain of
being reputed Accomplices of the said Offences, and
of being prosecuted as having tacitly contributed
thereunto; and that they who have Knowledge of
Law-Suits ready to be commenced amongst Gentlemen
for some Important Concern, shall be also obliged,
according to the same Third Article of the said Edict,
to give us Notice of the same, or the Governours▪
and the Lieutenants-General of Provinces, or the
Gentlemen deputed in the Bailiwicks, to the End
Means may be provided to hinder the Parties from
leaving the ordinary Course of Justice, and coming to
the Ways of Fact for doing themselves Right.</P>
<P>VII. And because that in all Offences that one may
receive, it is Necessary to Establish some General
Rules for the Satisfactions, which may sufficiently
repair the Honour, when once they are received and
practised; seeing it is but too true, that Opinion alone
hath established most Part of the Maxims of the Point
of Honour; and considering, that in Offences, it is
above all Things to be minded, if they have been
given without Cause, and if they have not been an∣swered
<PB N="60" REF="75"/>
with some Repartees or more heinous Re∣venges:
We declare that in those which have been so
given without Cause, and have not been answered,
if they consist in Reproachful Words, as of <HI>Sot, Coward,
Traitor,</HI> or the like, it may be ordered for a Punish∣ment,
that the Offender lie a Month in Prison, and
the Time not to be lessened by the Credit or Inter∣cession
of any Person whatsoever, no not by the In∣dulgence
of the Party Offended; and that after he
comes out of Prison, he shall declare to the Person
Offended, <HI>That impertinently, and out of purpose, he hath
offended him by outrageous Words, which he acknowledges
to be false, and begs his Pardon for them.</HI></P>
<P>VIII. For the Lye, or Blows with the Hand or
Cane, Two Months Imprisonment shall be appointed,
which, as before, cannot be Shortened; and after that
the Offender is come out of Prison, he shall ask the
Party Offended Pardon, with Words more Satisfacto∣ry
than the former, and which shall be particularly
specified by the Judges of the Point of Honour.</P>
<P>IX. For actual Offences by Cuffs, or the like, it shall
be appointed for Punishment, That the Offender lie
in Prison for Six Months, which Time, as before, is
not to be diminished, unless the Offender desire that
the half of that Imprisonment alone be commuted in∣to
a Fine, which cannot be less than 1500 Livres, ap∣plicable
to the next Hospital to the Place where the
Party Offended lives, and which shall be paid before
the Offender come out of Prison; nay, and after he
comes out, he shall submit himself over and above to
receive, from the Hand of the Party Offended, Blows
of the same Nature of those which he hath given, and
shall declare by Word and Writing, <HI>That he hath brutish∣ly
strucken him, and pray him to pardon and forget that
Offen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI></P>
<P>X. For Canings, or other Outrages of the like Na∣ture,
the Offender shall lie in Prison for a whole Year
and that Time cannot be Moderated, unless for Six
Months, upon Payment of 3000 Livres as a Fine, pay∣able
and applicable in the manner above-mentioned;
and after he is come out of Prison, he shall on hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="61" REF="76"/>
Knees beg Pardon of the Party Offended, in that Po∣sture
submit himself to receive the like Blows, hum∣bly
thank him, if he give him them not, as he might,
and besides declare by Words and Writing, <HI>That he
brutishly offended him, beseech him to forget it, and that
if he were in his place, he would be content with the same
Satisfaction.</HI> And in all Offences of Blows with the
Hand, Cane, or such like, besides the aforesaid Pu∣nishment
and Satisfactions, the Party Offended may
be obliged to Chastise the Offender with the same
Blows that he hath received, though he should even
be so Generous as not to give them, and that only in
case that the Offence be by the Circumstances judged
so Atrocious, that it requires the Party Offended to be
reduced to that Necessity.</P>
<P>XI. And when Accommodations are made in all
the aforesaid Cases, the Judges of the Point of Honour
may appoint what Number of the Friends of the Par∣ty
Offended they please, to see the Satisfactions En∣joined,
Performed, and Rendred more Publick.</P>
<P>XII. For Offences and Outrages done to the Honour
of a Gentleman, upon Occasion of some Civil Interest,
or of some Law-Suit already Commenced before the
Ordinary Judges, in these the Satisfactions cannot be
too rigorous. And they who adjust such Differences,
may, besides the Punishments above specified in every
kind of Offence, order also Banishment, for as long a
Time as they shall judge convenient, from the Places
where the Offender has his ordinary Residence. And
when, by Notoriety of Fact, or other Proofs, it be
made appear, That a Gentleman hath taken Possession
of any thing by the Ways of Fact or by Surprize, no
Accommodation can be made, no not concerning the
Point of Honour, till first the Thing disputed be put
into the same Condition it was before the Violence, or
Surprize.</P>
<P>XIII. And because besides the afore-mentioned
Causes of Differences, Words that may be pretended
to have been given and broken, produce a great many
others: We declare, That a Gentleman that hath got
a Promise of another, concerning any Business what∣soever,
<PB N="62" REF="77"/>
can build nothing upon it for the future, nor
complain of the Breach of it, unless it hath been given
him in Writing, or in Presence of one or more Gen∣tlemen.
So that all Gentlemen shall hereafter be ob∣liged
to use that Caution, not only for Obeying Our
Regulations, but also for the Interest that every one
hath of Preserving the Friendship of him that hath
past his Word to him, and of not being declared an
Aggressor, as he shall be for the Time to come in all
Quarrels that shall arise from a Promise given without
Writing or Witnesses, and which he shall pretend not
to have been kept.</P>
<P>XIV. If a Promise made in Writing, or before other
Gentlemen, be violated, the Party concerned shall be
obliged to demand Justice from Us, from the Gover∣nours,
or Lieutenant-Generals of Provinces, or from
the Gentlemen deputed, for Fault whereof he shall be
reputed Aggressor in all the Quarrels that may happen
upon Breach of that Promise: As also all the Wit∣nesses
of the said Breach of Promise who have not
given Notice of it, shall be responsible for all the Dis∣orders
that may follow thereupon. And as to what
concerns the said Breaches of Promise, Reparations and
Satisfactions shall be appointed according to the Im∣portance
of the Affair.</P>
<P>XV. If by the Relation of those that were present,
or other Proofs, it appear, that an Injury hath been
done upon a Premeditated Design, out of Frolick, and
upon Advantage, We declare, That according to the
Laws of Honour, the Party Offended may Prosecute
the Aggressor and his Complices before the Ordinary
Judges, as if he had been Assassinated. And that Pro∣ceeding
ought not to seem strange, since he that Of∣fends
another upon Advantage, by that Action renders
himself unworthy of being used as a Gentleman: If
nevertheless the Person Offended had not rather refer
himself to Our Judgment, or to the Judgment of the
other Judges of the Point of Honour for Satisfaction,
and for the Chastisement of the Aggressor, which
ought to be far greater than all the preceding, which
<PB N="63" REF="78"/>
only concern Offences given in sudden and unexpected
Quarrels.</P>
<P>XVI. In case a Gentleman refuse, or without law∣ful
Cause delay to Obey Our Orders, or the Orders of
the other Judges of the Point of Honour, as to ap∣pear
before Us or them, when he hath been Summon∣ed
to it, either Personally, or at his Dwelling House;
and also when he hath not Submitted to the Punish∣ments
inflicted upon him; he shall be, after a Time
pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scribed, forthwith Constrained to it, by Quarter∣ing
Soldiers in his House, or Imprisonment, conform
to the Eighth Article of the said Edict. Which shall
be carefully put in Execution by Our Provosts, Under-Bailiffs,
Under-Stewards, Lieutenants-Criminal of the
Short Robe, and other Lieutenants, Exempts, and
Officers of the Marshalseas, upon Pain of Suspension
from their Charges, and Loss of their Salaries; and
the said Execution shall be done at the Cost and
Charges of the Disobedient and Refractory Person.</P>
<P>XVII. And according to the same Eighth Article of
the said Edict, if Our Provosts, Under-Bailiffs, Un∣der-Stewards,
Lieutenants-Criminal of the Short
Robe, and other Officers of the Marshalseas, cannot
put in Execution the said Imprisonments, they shall
Seize and Estreat all the Revenues of the said Disobe∣dient,
give Advice of the said Seisures to the Attor∣neys-General
or their Subs<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itutes, according to the last
Declaration against Duelling, registred in the Parlia∣ment
of <HI>Paris</HI> the 29th of <HI>July</HI> last; the said Revenues
to be applied, and remain acquired, during all the Time
of Disobedience, to the Hospital of the Town where
the Parliament is; under the Jurisdiction whereof the
Goods of the Disobedient are jointly with the Hospi∣tal
of the Royal Seat, on which they also depend; to
the end that mutually assisting one another in the Pro∣secution,
the one may furnish Information and Proof,
the other Justice and Authority. And in case there be
preceding Debts which hinder the U<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lifting of the
Revenue confiscated to the Protit of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> said Hospitals,
the Sum to which the said Revenu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may amount shall
become a real Debt upon all the Goods Moveable and
<PB N="64" REF="79"/>
Immoveable of the Disobedient, to be Payed and Dis∣charged
in Course, according to the same Eighth Ar∣ticle
of the said Edict.</P>
<P>XVIII. If they who have been by us, and the other
Judges of the Point of Honour, put under Guard, mak<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
their Escape, the Accommodation shall not be made
till first they have kept Prison during the Time that
shall be appointed.</P>
<P>XIX. And generally in all the other Differences of
Offences, that have not been above Specified, and
which are of infinite Variety; as if they have been
given without Cause, and if they have been answered
with more heinous Repartees; or if by Outrageous
Words the Offender has drawn upon himself the Lye,
or a Cuff; and in a Word, in all other Rencounters of
Injuries insensibly aggravated, We refer it to the Judges
of the Point of Honour, to appoint such Punishments
and Satisfactions as the Cases and Circumstances shall
require; Exhorting them to have always a Particular
Eye upon him that hath been the Aggressor, and the
first Cause of the Offence, and to send back be∣fore
Us all those who would represent to us their
Reasons, conform to the Second Article of his Ma∣jesty's
last Edict, registred, as hath been said, in Par∣liament
the 7th of <HI>September,</HI> 1651.</P>

<HEAD>The new Regulation made by the Marshals of
France, which Confirms and Enlarges the

<P>THE King having commanded us to meet, and ex∣amine
of new the Regulation which we made by
express Orders of His Majesty, Dated the 22d of <HI>Au∣gust,</HI>
165<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, concerning the Satisfactions and Repara∣tions
of Honour amongst Gentelemen, it being His Ma∣jesty's
Intention to augment the Punishments and Sa∣tisfactions
in such Sort that they be equal and pro∣portionable
to the Injuries. In Obedience to his Ma∣jesty's
Orders, under his good will and Pleasure, We
have thought,</P>
<P>That the First, Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth
Articles of the said Regulation ought to be put in Ex∣ecution.</P>
<P>As
to the Sixth, it is our Opinion, That those who
have been present at Offences, and have not inform∣ed
of them, ought to be Punished by Six Months Im∣prisonment.</P>
<P>As
to the Seventh Article, instead of One Months
Imprisonment for him that hath Offended, we are
of Opinion, That he lye Two Months in Prison, and
that the rest of the Article be put in Execution.</P>
<P>As to the Eighth Article, it is our Opinion, That
the Offender ought to suffer Four Months Imprison∣ment
instead of Two, and after he hath come out of
Prison ask Pardon of the Party Offended.</P>
<P>As to the Ninth Article, We think that for actual
Offences of Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lows with the Hand in the Heat
of Quarrels, if a Lie went before the Box or Blow,
he that hath <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rucken ought to be committed to a
Prison for a Year: and if no Lie went before, he ought
<PB N="66" REF="81"/>
to lye in Prison for the space of Two Years, and the
Time not to be shortned for any Cause whatsoever,
though the Party Offended should even demand it;
and that after the Offender is come out of Prison, he
shall still submit to receive from the Hand of the Party
Offended the like Blows as he hath given, and shall
declare by Word and Writing, That he hath strucken
him Brutishly, and beseech him to Pardon him, and
to forget that Offence.</P>
<P>As to the Tenth Article, in regard of Caneings, or
other the like Outrages given in the Heat of Quarrels,
in case they have been given after a Box or Blow with
the Hand, he that hath strucken with a Cudgel, or o∣therwise,

<P>As to the Eleventh, Twelfth, Thirteenth and Four∣teenth
Articles, it is our Opinion, That they ought
to be put in Execution, and nothing altered in them.</P>
<P>As to the Fifteenth Article, we judge, that if by
the Relation of Persons Present, Notoriety, or any o∣ther
Proofs, it appear that an Injury by Blows of a
Cane, Cudgel, or any other of the like Nature, hath
been done by Premeditated Design, Surprize, or upon
Advantage, he that hath strucken singly and before
one's Face, ought to keep Prison for the space of Fif∣teen
Years; and that he who striketh behind one's
Back, though alone, and upon Advantage, whether
by taking Company along with him, or otherwise,
ought to keep Prison during the space of Twenty Years
complete, and that in a Town, Cittadel, or Fortress,
distant at least Thirty Leagues from the Place where
the Party Offended has his ordinary Residence: And
that Prohibition be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade by his Majesty to the Offen∣der
not to make his Escape out of Prison upon Pain
of Death; and to the Offended not to come within
Ten Leagues of the Place of the said Prison, upon
Pain of Disobedience:</P>
