<P>THE parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XVII.</NOTE> which was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>moned soon
after the King's accession, was both elected
and assembled in tranquillity;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1377.</NOTE> and the great
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Government during the minority.</NOTE> from a sovereign of consummate wisdom and
experience, to a boy of eleven years of age, was not
immediately felt by the people. The habits of order
and obedience, which the barons had been taught during
the long reign of Edward, still influenced them; and
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
the authority of the King's three uncles, the dukes of
Lancaster, York, and Glocester, sufficed to repress, for
a time, the turbulent spirit, to which that order, in a
weak reign, was so often subject. The dangerous am∣bition
too of these princes themselves was checked, by
the plain and undeniable title of Richard, by the decla∣ration
of it made by his grandfather in parliament, and
by the affectionate regard, which the people bore to the
memory of his father, and which was naturally transferred
to the young prince upon the throne. The different
characters of these three dukes, rendered them also a
counterpoize to each other; and it was natural to ex∣pect,
that any dangerous designs, which might be form∣ed
by one brother, would meet with opposition from the
others. Lancaster, whose age and experience and au∣thority
under the late King, gave him the ascendant
among them; tho' his integrity seemed not proof against
great temptations, was neither of an enterprizing spirit,
nor of a popular and engaging temper. York was in∣dolent,
unactive, and of a slender capacity. Glocester
was turbulent, bold, and popular; but being the youngest
of the family, was restrained by the power and autho∣rity
of his elder brothers. There appeared, therefore,
no circumstance in the domestic situation of England,
which might endanger the public peace, or give any
immediate apprehensions to the lovers of their country.</P>
<P>BUT as Edward, tho' he had fixed the succession to
the crown, had taken no care to establish a plan of go∣vernment
during the minority of his grandson; it be∣hoved
the parliament to supply this defect: And the
house of commons distinguished themselves, by taking
the lead on that occasion. This house, which had been
rising to consideration during the whole course of the
late reign, naturally received an accession of power du∣ring
the minority; and as it was now becoming a scene
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
of business, the commons chose for the first time a
speaker, who might perserve order in their debates, and
maintain those forms, which are requisite in all numer∣ous
assemblies. Peter de la Mare was the man pitched
on; the same person who had been imprisoned and de∣tained
in custody by the late King for his freedom of
speech in attacking the mistress and the ministers of that
prince. But tho' this election discovered a spirit of li∣berty
in the commons, and was followed by farther at∣tacks
both on these ministers, and on Alice Pierce<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 150.</NOTE>,
they were still too much sensible of their great inferio∣rity,
to assume at first any immediate share in the ad∣ministration
of government, or the care of the King's
person. They were contented to apply by petition to
the lords for that purpose, and desire them both to ap∣point
a council of nine, who might direct the public
business, and to choose men of a virtuous life and con∣versation,
who might inspect the conduct and education
of the young prince. The lords complied with the first
part of this request, and elected the bishops of London,
Carlisle, and Salisbury, the earls of Marche and Staf∣ford,
sir Richard de Stafford, sir Henry le Scrope, sir
John Devereux, and sir Hugh Segrave, to whom they
gave authority for a year to conduct the ordinary course
of business<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vii. p. 161.</NOTE>. But as to the regulation of the King's
household, they declined interposing in an office, which,
they said, was both so invidious in itself, and might
prove so disagreeable to his majesty.</P>
<P>THE commons, as they acquired more courage, ven∣tured
to proceed a step farther in their applications.
They presented a petition, in which they prayed the
King to check the prevailing custom among the barons
of forming illegal confederacies together, and support∣ing
each other, as well as men of inferior rank, in the
<PB N="2" REF="10"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="3" REF="11"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="4" REF="12"/>
violations of law and justice. They received from the
throne a general and an obliging answer to this peti∣tion:
But another part of their application, that all the
great officers should, during the King's minority, be ap∣pointed
by parliament, which seemed to require the con∣currence
of the commons, as well as that of the upper
house, in the nomination, was not complied with: The
lords alone assumed the power of appointing these offi∣cers:
The commons tacitly acquiesced in their choice;
and thought, that, for the present, they had proceeded
a sufficient length, if they but advanced their pretensions,
tho' rejected, of interposing in these more important
matters of state.</P>
<P>ON this footing then the government stood. The
administration was conducted entirely in the King's
name: No regency was expressly appointed: The coun∣cil
and the great officers, named by the peers, did their
duty, each in his separate department: And the whole
system was for some years kept together, by the secret
authority o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the King's uncles, especially of the duke
of Lancaster, who was in reality the regent.</P>
<P>THE parliament was dissolved, after the commons had
represented the necessity of their being re-assembled once
every year, as appointed by law; and after having
elected two citizens as their treasurers, to receive and
disburse the produce of two fifteens and tenths, which
they voted to the crown. In the other parliaments cal∣led
during the minority, the commons still discover a
strong spirit of freedom and sense of their own authority,
which, without, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eeding any disturbance, tended to se∣cure
their independance and that of the people<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P>In the fifth year of the King, <HI>the commons complained of the govern∣ment about the King's person, his court, the excessive number of his servants, of the abuses in the Chancery, King's Bench, Common Pleas, Exchequer, and of grievous oppressions in the country, by the great multitudes of maintainers of quarrels,</HI> (men linked in confederacies together) <HI>who behaved themselves like kings in the country, so as there was very little law or right, and of other things which they said were the cause of the late commotions under Wat Tyler.</HI> Parl. Hist. vol. i. p 365. This irregular government, which no king and no house of commons had been able to remedy, was the source of the licentiousness of the great, and turbulency of the people, as well as tyranny of the princes. If subjects would enjoy liberty, and Kings se∣curity, the laws must be executed.</P>
<P>In the ninth of this reign, the commons also discovered an accuracy and a jealousy of liberty, which we should little expect in these rude times. “It was agreed by parliament,” says Cotton <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, “that the subsidy of wools, wool fells, and skins, granted <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> King until the time of Mid-summer then ensuing, should cease <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sapn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> same time unto the feast of St. Peter <HI>ad vincula;</HI> for that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the King should be interrupted for claiming such grant as due.” <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> also Cotton, p. 198.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="13"/>
EDWARD had left his grandson involved in many dan∣gerous
wars. The pretensions of the duke of Lancaster
to the crown of Castile, made that kingdom still perse∣vere
in hostilities against England. Scotland, whose
throne was now filled by Robert Steuart, nephew to
David Bruce, and the first prince of that family, main∣tained
such close connexions with France, that war with
the one crown almost nccessarily produced hostilities
with the other. The French monarch, whose prudent
conduct had acquired him the sirname of <HI>wise,</HI> as he
had already baffled all the experience and valour of the
two Edwards, was likely to prove a dangerous enemy
to a minor King; but his genius, which was not natu∣rally
enterprizing, led him not, at present, to give any
great disturbance to his neighbours; and he laboured,
besides, under many difficulties at home, which it was
necessary for him to surmount, before he could think of
making conquests in an enemy's country. England was
master of Calais, Bourdeaux, and Bayonne; had lately
acquired possession of Cherbourg, from the cession of the
King of Navarre, and of Brest from that of the duke
<PB N="6" REF="14"/>
of Brittany<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vii. p. 190.</NOTE>; and having thus access into France from
every quarter, was able, even in its present situation, to
give annoyance to his government. Before Charles could
remove them from these important posts, he died in the
flower of his age, and left his kingdom to a minor son,
who bore the name of Charles VI.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE the war with France was carried on in
a manner somewhat languid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1378.</NOTE> and produced no enterprize
of great lustre or renown. Sir Hugh Calverley, who had
formerly headed a company of banditti in France, (for he,
as well as Sir Robert Knolles, and many of the most re∣nowned
commanders of Edward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1380.</NOTE> had once followed that
dishonourable profession) was governor of Calais; and
making an inroad into Picardy, with a detachment of the
garrison, he set fire to Boulogne<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Walsing, p. 209.</NOTE>. The duke of Lan∣caster
conducted an army into Brittany, but returned
without being able to perform any memorable action. In
a subsequent year, the duke of Glocester marched out
of Calais with a body of 2000 cavalry, and 8000 in∣fantry;
and scrupled not, with this small army, to enter
into the heart of France, and to continue his ravages,
thro' Picardy, Champaigne, the Brie, the Beausse, the
Gatinois, the Orleanois, till he reached his allies in the
province of Brittany<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 2. chap. 50, 51. Walsing. p. 239.</NOTE>. The duke of Burgundy, at the
head of a more considerable army, came within sight
of him; but the French were so over-awed by the for∣mer
successes of the English, that no superiority of num∣bers
could tempt them to venture a pitched battle with
the troops of that nation. As the duke of Brittany, soon
after the arrival of these succours, formed an accommo∣dation
with the court of France; this enterprize also
<PB N="7" REF="15"/>
proved in the issue unsuccessful, and made no durable
impression upon the enemy.</P>
<P>THE expences of these armaments, and the usual want
of oeconomy attending a minority, much exhausted the
English treasury, and obliged the parliament, in order
to supply it, to impose a new and extraordinary tax of three
groats on every person, male and female, above fifteen
years of age; and they ordained that, in levying that
tax, the opulent should relieve the poor by an equitable
compensation. This imposition excited a mutiny, which
was very singular in its circumstances. All history
abounds with examples, where the great tyrannize over
the meaner sort: But here the lowest populace rose
against their rulers, exercised the most cruel ravages upon
them, and took vengeance for all their former oppres∣sions.</P>
<P>THE faint dawning of the arts and of good govern∣ment
in that age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1381.</NOTE> had excited the minds of the popu∣lace,
in different states of Europe, to wish for a better
condition, and to murmur against those chains, which the
laws, enacted by the haughty nobility and gentry, had
so long imposed upon them. The commotions of the
people in Flanders, the mutiny of the peasants in France,
were the natural effects of this growing spirit of inde∣pendance;
and the report of these events, being brought
into England, where personal slavery was more general
than in any other country of Europe<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 2. chap. 74.</NOTE>, had prepared
the minds of the multitude for an insurrecti∣on.
One John Ball also, a seditious preacher, who affected low
popularity, went about the country, and inculcated on
his audience the principles of the first origin of mankind
from one common stock, their equal right to liberty and
to all the goods of nature, the tyranny of artificial
<PB N="8" REF="16"/>
distinctions, and the abuses which had arisen from the
degradation of the more considerable, part of the species,
and the aggrandizement of a few insolent rulers<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, liv. 2. chap. 74. Walsingham, p. 275.</NOTE>. These
doctrines, so agreeable to the populace and so conform∣able
to the ideas of primitive equality, which are en∣graven
in the hearts of all men, were greedily received
by the multitude; and had scattered the sparks of that
sedition, which the present tax raised into a conflagration.</P>
<P>THE imposition of three groats a head had been farmed
out to tax-gathers in each county,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrections of the common people.</NOTE> who levied the mo∣ney
with rigour on the people; and the clause, of making
the rich ease their poorer neighbours of some share of the
burden, being so vague and undetermined, had doubtless
occasioned many partialities, and made the people more
sensible of the unequal lot, which fortune had assigned
them in the distribution of her favours. The first disorder
arose from a black-smith in a village of Essex. The
tax-gatherers came to this man's shop, while he was at
work, and demanded payment for his daughter, whom
he asserted to be below the age assigned by the statute.
One of these fellows offered to produce a very indecent
proof to the contrary, and at the same time laid hold of
the maid: Which the father resenting, immediately
knocked out the ruffian's brains with his hammer. The
bystanders applauded the action, and exclaimed, that it
was full time for the people to take vengeance of their
tyrants, and to vindicate their native liberty. They im∣mediately
flew to arms: The whole neighbourhood
joined in the sedition: The flame spread in an instant
over the county: It soon propagated itself into that of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, of Hertford, Surrey, Sussex, Suffolk, Norfolk,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and Lincoln. Before the government had
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> least warning of the danger, the disorder had risen
<PB N="9" REF="17"/>
beyond controul or opposition: The populace had shaken
off all regard to their former masters: And being headed
by the most audacious and criminal of their associates,
who assumed the feigned names of Wat Tyler, Jack
Straw, Hob Carter, and Tom Miller, by which they
were fond of denoting their mean origin, they com∣mitted
every where the most outrageous violences on such
of the gentry or nobility as had the misfortune to fall
into their hands.</P>
<P>THE insurgents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th June.</NOTE> amounting to an hundred thousand
men, assembled on Black-heath, under their leaders,
Tyler and Straw; and as the princess of Wales, the
King's mother, returning from a pilgrimage to Canter∣bury,
passed thro' the midst of them, they attacked her
company, and some of the most insolent among them,
to show their purpose of levelling all mankind, forced
kisses from her; but they allowed her to continue her
journey, without attempting any farther injury<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 2. chap. 74.</NOTE>. They
sent a message to the King, who had taken shelter
in the Tower; and desired a conference with him.
Richard sailed down the river in a barge; but oil his ap∣proaching
the shore, he saw such symptoms of tumult
and insolence, that he put back and returned to that
fortress<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. chap. 75.</NOTE>. The mutinous peasants, meanwhile, favoured
by the city rabble, had broke into London; had burnt
the duke of Lancaster's palace of the Savoy; cut off the
heads of all the gentlemen whom they laid hold of; ex∣pressed
a particular animosity against the lawyers and
attornies; and pillaged the warehouses of the rich mer∣chants<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. chap, 76. Walsingham, p. 248, 249.</NOTE>.
A great body of them quartered themselves at
Mile-end; and the King, finding no defence in the
Tower, which was weakly garrisoned, and ill supplied
with provisions, was obliged to go out to them, and ask
<PB N="10" REF="18"/>
their demands. They required a general pardon, the
abolition of slavery, freedom of commerce in market∣towns
without tolls or imposts, and a fixed rent on lands
instead of the services due by villenage. These requests,
which, tho' extremely reasonable in themselves, the na∣tion
was not sufficiently prepared to receive, and which it
was dangerous to have extorted by violence, were how∣ever
complied with; charters to that purpose were granted
them; and this body immediately dispersed and returned
to their several homes<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 2. chap. 77.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DURING this transaction, another body of the rebels
had broke into the Tower; had murdered Simon Sudbury,
the primate, and chancellor, with Sir Robert Hales, the
treasurer, and some other persons of distinction; and
continued their ravages in the city<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 250, 251.</NOTE>. The King passing
along Smithfield, very slenderly guarded, met with Wat
Tyler, at the head of these rioters, and entered into a
conference with him. Tyler, having ordered his com∣panions
to retire till he should give them a signal, after
which they were to murder all the company except the
King himself, whom they were to detain prisoner, feared
not to come into the midst of the royal retinue. He
there behaved himself in such a manner, that Walworth,
the mayor of London, not able to bear his insolence,
drew his sword, and struck him so violent a blow as
brought him to the ground, where he was instantly dis∣patched
by others of the King's train. The mutineers
seeing their leader fall, prepared themselves for revenge;
and this whole company, with the King himself, had un∣doubtedly
perished on the spot, had it not been for an
extraordinary presence of mind which Richard discovered
on this occasion. He ordered his company to stop; he
advanced alone towards the enraged multitude; and
<PB N="11" REF="19"/>
accosting them with an affable and intrepid countenance,
he asked them, “What is the meaning of this disorder,
my good people? Are you angry that you have lost
your leader? I am your King: I will be your leader.”
The populace, overawed by his presence, implicitly fol∣lowed
him: He led them out into the fields, to prevent
any disorder which might have arisen by their continuing
in the city: Being there joined by Sir Robert Knolles
and a body of well armed veteran soldiers, who had been
secretly drawn together, he strictly prohibited that officer
from falling on the rioters, and committing an undistin∣guished
slaughter upon them; and he peaceably dismissed
them with the same charters, which had been granted to
their companions<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Froissart, vol. ii. chap. 77. Walsingham, p. 252. Knyghton, p. 2637.</NOTE>. Soon after, the nobility and gentry,
hearing of the King's danger, in which they were all
involved, flocked to London with their adherents and
retainers; and Richard took the field at the head of an
army 40,000 strong<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 267.</NOTE>. It then behoved all the other
rebels to submit: The charters of enfranchisement and
pardon were revoked by parliament; the low people were
reduced to the same slavish condition as before, and seve∣ral
of the ringleaders were severely punished for the late
disorders. It was pretended, that the intentions of the
insurgents had been to seize the King's person, to carry
him thro' England at their head, to murder all the nobi∣lity,
gentry and lawyers, and even all the bishops and
priests, except the mendicant friars; to dispatch after∣wards
the King himself; and having thus reduced all the
people to a level, to order the kingdom at their pleasure<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 265.</NOTE>.
It is not impossible, that many of them, in the delirium
of their first success, might have formed such projects:
But of all the evils attending human society, the insur∣rections
of the populace, when not raised and supported
<PB N="12" REF="20"/>
by persons of higher quality, is the least to be dreaded:
The mischiefs, consequent on an abolition of all rank
distinction, become so great, that they are immedi∣ately
felt, and soon bring back affairs to their former
order and arrangement.</P>
<P>A YOUTH of sixteen, (which was at this time the King's
age) that had discovered so much courage, presence of
mind, and address, and had so dextrously eluded the vio∣lence
of this tumult, gave great hopes to the nation;
and it was natural to expert, that he would, in the
course of his life, equal the glories, which had so uni∣formly
attended his father and his grandfather, in all their
undertakings.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1385.</NOTE> But in proportion as Richard advanced
in years, these hopes were blasted; and his want of ca∣pacity,
at least of solid judgment, appeared in every
enterprize, which he attempted. The Scots, sensible
of their own deficiency in cavalry, had applied to the
regency of Charles VI. and John de Vienne, admiral
of France, had been sent over with a body of 1500 men
at arms, to support them in their incursions against the
English. The danger was now deemed by the King's
uncles somewhat serious; and a great army of 60,000
men was levied and conducted against Scotland, with
Richard himself at the head of it. The Scots pretended
not to make resistance to so great a force: They aban∣doned
without scruple their country to be pillaged and
destroyed by the enemy: And when de Vienne expressed
his surprize at this plan of operations, they told him,
that all their cattle was driven into the forests and fast∣nesses;
that their houses and other goods were of no
value; and that they well knew how to compensate them∣selves
for any losses, which they might sustain in that
respect, by making an invasion on the English. Ac∣cordingly,
when Richard entered Scotland by Berwic
and the east coast, the Scots and French, to the number
of 30,000 men, passed the borders of England by the
<PB N="13" REF="21"/>
west, and carrying on their ravages thro' Cumberland,
Westmoreland, and Lancashire, collected a rich booty,
and then returned in tranquillity to their own country.
Richard meanwhile advanced towards Edinburgh, and
destroyed in his way all the towns and villages on each
side of him: He reduced that city to ashes: He treated
in the same manner Perth, Dundee, and other places in
the low countries; but when he was advised to march
towards the west coast, to await there the return of the
enemy, and to take revenge on them for their devasta∣tions,
his impatience to be in England, and enjoy his
usual pleasures and amusements, was more prevalent;
and he carried back his army, without effecting any thing
by all these mighty preparations. The Scots, soon after,
finding the solid bodies of French cavalry very useless
in that desultory kind of war, to which they confined
themselves, treated their allies so ill, that the French
returned home; very much disgusted with the country,
and the manners of its inhabitants<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 2. chap. 149, 150, &amp;c. liv. 3. chap. 52. Wal∣singham, p. 316, 317.</NOTE>. The English, tho'
they regretted the indolence and dissolute manners of their
King, saw themselves for the future secured against any
dangerous invasion from that quarter.</P>
<P>BUT it was so material an interest of the French court
to wrest the sea-port towns from<NOTE PLACE="marg">1386.</NOTE> the hands of their ene∣my,
that they resolved to attempt it by some other expe∣dient,
and found no means so likely as by an invasion
of England itself. They collected an immense fleet and
army at Sluise; for the Flemings were now in alliance
with them: All the nobility of France were engaged in
this enterprize: The English were kept in alarm: Great
preparations were made for the reception of the invaders:
<PB N="14" REF="22"/>
And tho' the dispersion of the French ships by a storm,
and the taking of many of them by the English, before
the embarkation of the troops, freed the kingdom from
the present danger, they were fully sensible, that this
perilous situation might every moment return upon
them<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 3. chap. 41. 53. Walsingham, p. 321, 323.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE were two circumstanccs chiefly, which en∣gaged
the French at this time to think of such attempts.
The one was the absence of the duke of Lancaster, who
had carried into Spain all the flower of the English mili∣tary
force, in prosecution of his vain claim to the crown
of Castile; an enterprize, in which, after some promis∣ing
success, he was finally disappointed: The other was,
the violent dissensions and disorders, which had taken
place in the English government.</P>
<P>THE subjection, in which Richard was held by his
uncles, particularly by the duke of Glocester, a prince
of enterprize and genius, tho' it was not unsuitable to
his years and slender capacity, was extremely disagreeable
to his violent temper; and he began to rebel against the
yoke imposed upon him. Robert de Vere, earl of Oxford,
a young man of a noble family, of an agreeable figure, but
of dissolute manners, had acquired an entire ascendant
over him; and ruled him with the most absolute authority.
The King knew so little bounds to his affection, that
he first created his favourite marquis of Dublin, a title
before unknown in England, and then duke of Ireland;
and transferred to him by patent, which was confirmed
in parliament, the entire sovereignty for life of that
island<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 310, 311. Cox's Hist, of Ireland, p. 129. Walsing∣ham, p. 324.</NOTE>. He gave him in marriage his cousin german,
the daughter of Ingelram de Couci, earl of Bedford; but
soon after permitted him to repudiate that lady, tho' of
<PB N="15" REF="23"/>
an unexceptionable character, and to marry a foreigner,
a Bohemian, with whom he had become enamoured<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 328.</NOTE>.
These public declarations of attachment turned the
whole court towards the favourite: All graces passed
thro' his hands: Access to the King could only be ob∣tained
thro' his mediation: And Richard seemed to take
no pleasure in royal authority, but so far as it enabled
him to load with favours and titles and dignities this ob∣ject
of his affections.</P>
<P>THE jealousy of power immediately produced an ani∣mosity<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discontent of the ba∣rons.</NOTE>
between the minion and his creatures on the one
hand, and the princes of the blood and chief nobility on
the other; and the usual complaints against the insolence
of favourites were loudly echoed and greedily received, in
every part of the kingdom. Mowbray, earl of Notting∣ham,
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mareschal, Fitz-Alan earl of Arundel, Piercy
earl of Northumberland, Montacute earl of Salisbury,
Beauchamp earl of Warwic, were all connected with
each other, and with the princes, by friendship or allian∣ces,
and still more by their antipathy to those who had
eclipsed them in the King's favour and confidence. No
longer kept in awe by the personal character of the prince,
they scorned to submit to his ministers; and the methods,
which they took to redress the grievance complained of,
well suited the violence of that age, and the desperate
extremities, to which every opposition was sure to be
instantly carried.</P>
<P>MICHAEL DE LA POLE, the present chancellor, and
lately created earl of Suffolk, was the son of an eminent
merchant; but had risen by his abilities and valour during
the wars of Edward III. had acquired the friendship of
that monarch, and was esteemed the person of greatest
experience and capacity among those who were attached
to the duke of Ireland and the King's secret council.
<PB N="16" REF="24"/>
The duke of Glocester, who had the house of commons
at his devotion, impelled them to exercise that power
which they seem first to have assumed against lord La∣timer
during the declining years of the late King; and
an impeachment against the chancellor was carried up by
them to the house of peers, which was no less at his de∣votion.
The King foresaw the tempest preparing against
him and his ministers. After attempting in vain to rouse
the Londoners to his defence, he withdrew from parlia∣ment,
and retired with his court to Eltham. The par∣liament
sent a deputation, inviting him to return, and
threatening, that, if he continued to absent himself, they
would immediately dissolve, and leave the nation, tho'
at that time in imminent danger of a French invasion,
without any support or supply for its defence. At the
same time, a member was encouraged to call for the re∣cord,
containing the parliamentary deposition of Edward II.;
a plain intimation of the fate, which Richard,
if he continued refractory, had reason to expect from
them. The King, finding himself unable to resist, was
contented to stipulate, that, except finishing the present
impeachment against Suffolk, no attack should be made
against any other of his ministers; and on that condition,
he returned to the parliament<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2715, &amp;c. The same author, p. 2680, tells us, that the King, in return to the message, said, that he would not for their desire remove the meanest scullion from his kitchen. This author also tells us, that the King said to the commissioners, when they ha∣rangued him, that he saw his subjects were rebellious, and his best way would be to call in the King of France to his aid. But it is plain, that, all these speeches were either intended by Knyghton merely as an orna∣ment to his history, or are false. For (1) when the five lords accuse the King's ministers in the next parliament, and impute to them every rash action of the King, they speak nothing of these replies which are so ob∣noxious, were so recent, and are pretended to have been so public. (2) The King, so far from having any connexions at that time with France, was threatened with a dangerous invasion from that kingdom. This story seems to have been taken from the reproaches afterwards thrown out against him, and to have been transferred by the historian to this time, to which they cannot be applied.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="25"/>
NOTHING can prove more fully the innocence of Suf∣folk,
than the frivolousness of the articles, which his
enemies, in the present plenitude of their power, thought
proper to object against him<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 315. Knyghton, p. 26<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE>. It was alleged, that
being chancellor, and obliged by his oath to consult
the King's profit, he had purchased lands of the crown below
their true value; that he had exchanged with the king a
perpetual annuity of 400 marks a year, which he enjoyed
from his father, and which was assigned upon the customs
of the port of Hull, for lands of an equal income; that
having obtained for his son the priory of St. Anthony,
which was formerly possessed by a Frenchman, an enemy
and a schismatic, and a new prior being at the same time
named by the Pope, he had refused to admit this person,
till he made a composition with his son, and agreed to
pay him an hundred pounds a year from the benefice;
that he had purchased, from one Tydeman of Limborch,
an old and forfeited annuity of fifty pounds a year upon
the crown, and had engaged the King to admit that bad
debt upon his revenues; and that, when created earl of
Suffolk, he had obtained a grant of 500 pounds a year,
to support the dignity of that title<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">It is probable that the earl of Suffolk was not rich, nor able to support the dignity without the bounty of the crown: For his father Mi∣chael de la Pole, though a great merchant, had been ruined by lending money to the late king. See Cotton, p. 194. We may remark that the dukes of Glocester and York, tho' vastly rich, received at the same time each of them a thousand pounds a year, to support their dignity. Rymer, vol. vii. p. 481. Cotton, p. 310.</NOTE>. Even the proof of
these articles, frivolous as they are, was found very de∣fective
upon the trial: It appeared, that Suffolk had
<PB N="18" REF="26"/>
made no purchases of the crown while he was chancellor,
and that all his bargains of that kind were made before
he was advanced to that dignity<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 315.</NOTE>. It is almost needless
to add, that he was condemned, notwithstanding his de∣fence;
and that he was deprived of his office.</P>
<P>GLOCESTER and his associates observed their stipulation
with the King, and attacked no more of his ministers:
But they immediately attacked himself and his royal dig∣nity,
and framed a commission after the model of those,
which, had been attempted almost in every reign since that
of Richard I. and which had always been attended with
the most extreme confusion<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2686. Statutes at large, 10 Rich. II. chap. i.</NOTE>. By this commission a
council of fourteen persons were appointed, all of Gloces∣ter's
faction, except Nevil, archbishop of York: The
sovereign power was transferred to these men for a
twelvemonth: The King, who had now reached the
twenty-first year of his age, was in reality dethroned:
The aristocracy was rendered supreme: And tho' the
term of the commission was limited to a twelvemonth, it
was easy to foresee, that the intentions of the party were
to render it perpetual, and that power would with great dif∣ficulty
be wrested from those grasping hands, to which it
was once committed. Richard, however, was obliged to
submit: He signed the commission; he took an oath ne∣ver
to infringe it; and tho' at the end of the session, he
<HI>publickly</HI> entered a protest, that the prerogatives of his
crown, notwithstanding his late concession, should still
be deemed entire and unimpaired<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 318.</NOTE>, the new commission∣ers,
without regarding it, proceeded to the exercise of
their authority.</P>
<P>THE King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1387.</NOTE> thus dispossest of royal power, was soon
sensible of the contempt into which he was fallen.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil com∣motions.</NOTE>
<PB N="19" REF="27"/>
His favourites and ministers, who were as yet allowed to
remain about his person, failed not to aggravate the in∣jury,
which, without any demerit on his part, had been
offered to him. And his eager temper was of itself suffi∣ciently
inclined to seek the means both of recovering his
authority and of revenging himself on those who had in∣vaded
it. As the house of commons appeared now of
some weight in the constitution, he tried secretly some
expedients for procuring a favourable election: He sounded some
of the sheriffs, who being at that time both
the returning officers, and magistrates of great power
in the counties, would naturally have considerable influ∣ence
in elections: But as most of them had been appointed
by his uncles, either during his minority, or during the
course of the present commission, he found them in ge∣neral
averse to his enterprize. The sentiments and incli∣nations
of the judges were more favourable to him. He
met at Nottingham sir Robert Tresilian, chief justice of
the King's Bench, sir Robert Belknappe, chief justice of
the Common Pleas, sir John Cary, chief baron of the
Exchequer, Holt, Fulthorpe, and Bourg, inferior justices,
and Lokton, serjeant at law; and he proposed to them
some queries, which these lawyers, either from the influ∣ence
of his authority or of reason; made no scruple of an∣swering
in the way he desired. They declared, that the
late commission was derogatory to the royalty and prero∣gative
of the King; that those who procured it, or ad∣vised
the King to consent to it, were punishable with
death; that those who necessitated and compelled him
were guilty of treason; that those were equally criminal
who should persevere in maintaining it; that the King
has the right of dissolving parliaments when he pleases;
that the parliament, while it sits, must proceed first upon
the King's business; and that that assembly cannot with∣out
the King's consent impeach any of his ministers and
<PB N="20" REF="28"/>
judges<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2694. Ypod Neust. p. 541.</NOTE>. Even according to our present strict maxims
with regard to law and the royal prerogative, all these
determinations, except the two last, were entirely justi∣fiable:
And as the great privileges of the commons, par∣ticularly
that of impeachment, were hitherto very new,
and supported by few precedents, there want not reasons
of apology for these opinions of the judges. They signed
therefore their answer to the King's queries before the
archbishops of York and Dublin, the bishops of Dur∣ham,
Chichester, and Bangor, the Duke of Ireland, the
earl of Suffolk, and two other counsellors of inferior
quality.</P>
<P>THE duke of Glocester, and his adherents, soon got
intelligence of this secret consultation; and were, natu∣rally
much alarmed at it. They saw the King's inten∣tion,
not only of recovering his authority, but of
punishing them for invading it; and they determin∣ed
to prevent the execution of his purpose. As
soon as he came to London, which, they knew, was
well disposed to their party, they secretly assembled
their forces, and appeared in arms at Haringay-park,
near Highgate, with a power, which Richard and
his ministers were not able to resist. They sent him a
message by the archbishop of Canterbury, and the lords
Lovel, Cobham, and Devereux, and demanded, that the
persons who had seduced him by their pernicious counsel,
and were traitors both to him and to the kingdom,
should be delivered to them. A few days after, they ap∣peared
in his presence, armed and attended with armed
followers; and they accused by name the archbishop of
York, the duke of Ireland, the earl of Suffolk, Sir Ro∣bert
Tresilian, and Sir Nicholas Brembre, as public and
dangerous enemies to the state. They threw down their
gauntlets before the king, and fiercely offered to main∣tain
<PB N="21" REF="29"/>
the truth of their charge by duel. The persons ac∣cused,
and all the other obnoxious ministers, had with∣drawn
or concealed themselves.</P>
<P>THE duke of Ireland fled to Cheshire, and levied some
forces, with which he advanced to relieve the King
from the violence of the nobles. Glocester encountered
him in Oxfordshire with much superior forces; routed
him, dispersed his followers, and obliged him to fly into
the Low-Countries, where he died in exile a few years
after.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1388.</NOTE> The lords then appeared at London with an army
of 40,000 men;<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d February.</NOTE> and having obliged the King to sum∣mon
a parliament, which was entirely at their devotion,
they had full power, by observing a few legal forms, to
take vengeance on all their enemies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Expulsion or execu∣tion
of the King's ministers.</NOTE> Five, great peers,
men whose combined power was able at any time to shake
the throne, Thomas duke of Glocester, the King's
uncle; Henry earl of Derby, son of the duke of Lan∣caster;
Richard earl of Arundel and Surrey; Thomas
earl of Warwic, and Thomas earl of Nottingham, and
maresachal of England, entered before the parliament an
accusation or appeal, as it was called, against the five
counsellors, whom they had already accused before the
King. The parliament, who ought to have been judges,
were not ashamed to impose an oath on all their members,
by which they bound themselves to live and die with the
lords appellants, and to defend them against all their
enemies with their lives and fortunes<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 322.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE other proceedings were well suited to the violence
and iniquity of the times. A charge, consisting of thirty∣nine
articles, was delivered in by the appellants; and
as none of the accused counsellors, except Sir Nicholas
Brembre, was in custody, the rest were cited to answer;
and upon their non-appearance, after a very short interval,
<PB N="22" REF="30"/>
without hearing a witness, without examining a fact, or
deliberating on one point of law, the house of peers decla∣red
them guilty of high treason. Sir Nicholas Brembre,
who was produced in court, had the appearance, and
probably no more than the appearance, of a trial: The
peers, tho' they were not by law his proper judges,
pronounced, in a very summary manner, sentence of
death upon him; and he was executed, together with
Sir Robert Tresilian, who had been discovered and taken
in the interval.</P>
<P>IT would be tedious to recite the whole charge deli∣vered
in against the five counsellors; which is to be
met with in several collections<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2715. Tyrrel, vol. iii. part 2. p. 919. from the records. Parliamentary History, vol. i. p. 414.</NOTE>. It is sufficient to ob∣serve
in general, that if we reason upon the supposition,
which is the true one, that the royal prerogative was in∣vaded
by the commission given to the duke of Gloces∣ter
and his associates, and that the King's person was
afterwards detained in custody by rebels, many of the
articles will appear, not only to imply no crime in the
duke of Ireland and the ministers, but to impute to them
actions, which were laudable, and which they were
bound by their allegiance to perform. The few articles
respecting the conduct of these ministers before that
commission, which subverted the constitution, and anni∣hilated
all justice and legal authority, are vague and ge∣neral;
such as their engrossing the King's favour, keep∣ing
the grandees at a distance from him, obtaining un∣reasonable
grants for themselves or their creatures, and
dissipating the public treasure by useless expences. No
violence is objected to them; no particular illegal act<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><P>We must except the 12th article, wihich accuses Brembre of hav∣ing cut off the heads of twenty-two prisoners, confined for felony or debt, without warrant or process of law: But as it is not conceivable what interest Brombre could have to treat these felons and debtors in such a manner; we may presume that the fact is either false or misre∣presented. It was in these mens power to say any thing against the persons accused: No defence or apology was admitted: All was law∣less will and pleasure.</P>
<P>They are also accu∣sed of designs to murder the lords; but these accusations either are general, or destroy one another. Sometimes, as in article 15th, they intend to murder them by means of the mayor and city of London: Sometimes, as in article 28th, by trial and false in∣quests: Sometimes, as in article 28th, by means of the King of France, who was to receive Calais for his pains.</P></NOTE>;
<PB N="23" REF="31"/>
no breach of any statute; and their administration may
therefore be concluded to have been so far innocent and
inoffensive. All the disorders indeed seem to have pro∣ceeded,
not from any infringement of the laws attempted
by the ministers, but merely from a rivalship of power,
which the duke of Glocester, and the great nobility,
agreeable to the genius of the times, carried to the utmost
extremity against their opponents, without any regard to
reason, justice, of humanity.</P>
<P>BUT these were not the only acts of violence committed
during the triumph of the party. All the other judges,
who had signed the extrajudicial opinions at Nottingham,
were condemned to death, and were, as a grace or fa∣vour,
banished to Ireland; tho' they pleaded the fear of
their lives, and the menaces of the King's ministers as
their excuse. The lord Beauchamp of Holt, sir James
Berners, and John Salisbury, were also tried and con∣demned
for high treason; merely because they had at∣tempted
to defeat the late commission: But the life of
the latter was spared. The fate of sir Simon Burley was
more severe: This gentleman was much beloved for
his personal merit, had distinguished himself by many
honourable actions<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">At least, this is the character given of him by Froissart, liv. 2. who knew him personally: Walsin, p. 334, gives a very different character of him; but he is a writer somewhat passionate and partial; and the choice made of this gentleman by Edward III and the Black Prince for the education of Richard, makes the character given of him by Froissart, much more probable.</NOTE>, was created knight of the garter,
<PB N="24" REF="32"/>
and had been appointed governor to Richard, by the
choice of the late King and the Black, Prince: He had
attended his master from the earliest infancy of that
prince, and had ever remained extremely attached to
him: Yet all these considerations could not save him from
falling a victim to Glocester's vengeance. This execu∣tion,
more than all the others, made a deep impression on
Richard's mind: His Queen too (for he was already
married to the sister of the Emperor Wincheslaus, King
of Bohemia) interested herself extremely in behalf of
Burley: She remained three hours on her knees before
the earl of Glocester, pleading for that gentleman's life;
but tho' she was become extremely popular by her amiable
qualities, which had acquired her the appellation of <HI>the
good Queen Ann;</HI> her petition was sternly rejected by the
inexorable tyrant.</P>
<P>THE parliament concluded this violent scene by a de∣claration,
that none of the articles, decided on these
trials to be treason, should ever afterwards be drawn in∣to
precedent by the judges, who were still to consider
the statute of the twenty-fifth of Edward as the rule of
their conduct. The house of lords seem not at that time
to have known or acknowledged the principle, that they
themselves were bound, in their judicial capacity, to fol∣low
the rules, which they had established in their legis∣lative<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">In general, the parliament in those days never paid a proper regard to Edward's statute of treasons, tho' one of the most advantageous laws for the subject that has ever been enacted. In the 17th of the King, <HI>the dukes of Lancaster and Glocester complain to Richard that Sir Thomas Tal∣bot, with others of his adherents, conspired the death of the said dukes in divers parts of Cheshire, as the same was confessed and well known; and praying that the parliament may judge of the fault. Whereupon the King and the lords in the parliament judged the same fact to be open and high treason: And hereup∣on they award two writs, the one to the sheriff of York, and the other to the sheriffs of Derby, to take the body of the said Sir Thomas returnable in the King's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ench in the month of Easter then ensuing. And open proclamation was made in Westminster-hall, that upon the sheriff's return, and at the next coming in of tbe said Sir Thomas, the said Thomas should be convicted of treason, and incur the loss and pain of the same: And all such as should receive him after the pro∣clamation should incur the same loss and pain.</HI> Cotton, p. 354. It is to be observed, that this extraordinary judgment was passed in a time of tran∣quillity. Tho' the statute itself of Edward III. reserves a power to the parliament to declare any new species of treason, it is not to be supposed that this power was reserved to the house of lords alone, or that men were to be judged by a law <HI>ex post facto.</HI> At least, if such be the mean∣ing of the clause; it may be affirmed, that men were at that time very ignorant of the first principles of law and justice.</NOTE>.
It was also enacted that every one should
<PB N="25" REF="33"/>
swear to the perpetual maintenance and support of the
forfeitures and attainders, and of all the other acts passed
during this parliament. The archbishop of Canterbury
added the penalty of excommunication, as a farther secu∣rity
of these deeds of violence.</P>
<P>IT might naturally be expected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1389.</NOTE> that the king, being
reduced to such slavery by the combination of the princes
of the blood and the chief nobility, and having appeared
so unable to defend his servants from the most cruel effects
of their resentment, would long remain in subjection to
them; and never would recover the royal power, with∣out
the most violent struggles and convulsions: But the
event proved otherwise. In less than a twelvemonth,
Richard, who was in his twenty-third year, declared in
council, that as he had now attained the full age, which
intitled him to govern by his own authority his kingdom
and household, he resolved to exercise his right of sove∣reignty;
and when no one ventured to contradict so rea∣sonable
an intention, he deprived Fitz-Alan archbishop
<PB N="26" REF="34"/>
of Canterbury of the dignity of chancellor, and bestowed
that high office on William of Wickham, bishop of
Winchester; the bishop of Hereford was displaced from
the office of treasurer, the earl of Arundel from that of
admiral; even the duke of Glocester and the earl of
Warwic were removed for a time from the council-board:
And no opposition was made to these great changes.
The history of this reign is very imperfect, and very little
to be depended on; except where it is supported by the
public records: And it is not easy for us to assign the
reason of this unexpected event. Perhaps, some secret
animosities, naturally to be expected in that situation,
had crept in among the great men, and enabled the King
to recover his authority. Perhaps, the violence of their
former proceedings had lost them the affections of the
people, who soon repent of any cruel extremities, to
which they are carried by their leaders. However this
may be, Richard exercised with moderation the autho∣rity
which he had returned. He seemed to be entirely
reconciled to his uncles<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, vol. ii. p. 170.</NOTE> and the other great men, of
whom he had so much reason to complain: He never
attempted to recal from banishment the duke of Ireland,
whom he found so obnoxious to them: He confirmed by
proclamation the general pardon, which the parliament
had passed for all offences: And he courted the affections
of the people, by voluntarily remitting some subsidies,
which had been granted him; a remarkable, and almost
a singular instance of such generosity.</P>
<P>AFTER this composure of domestic differences, and
restoration of the government to its natural state, there
passes an interval of eight years, which affords not many
remarkable events. The duke of Lancaster returned
from Spain; having resigned to his rival all pretensions
to the crown of Castile upon payment of a large sum
<PB N="27" REF="35"/>
of money<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2677. Walsingham, p. 342.</NOTE>, and having married his daughter, Philippa,
to the King of Portugal. The authority of this prince
served to counterbalance that of the duke of Glocester,
and secured the power of Richard, who paid great court
to his eldest uncle, by whom he had never been offended,
and whom he found more moderate in his temper than
the younger. He made accession to him for life of the
dutchy of Guienne<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. Vii. P. 659.</NOTE>, which the inclinations and change∣able
humour of the Gascons had restored to the English
government; but as they remonstrated loudly against this
deed, it was finally, with the duke's consent, revoked
by Richard<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 687.</NOTE>. There happened an incident, which pro∣duced
a dissention between Lancaster and his two bro∣thers.
After the death of the Spanish princess, he
espoused Catharine Swineford, daughter of a private
knight of Hainault, by whole alliance, York and Glo∣cester
thought the dignity of their family much injured:
But the King gratified his uncle by passing in parliament
a charter of legitimation to the children, whom that lady
had born him before marriage, and by creating the
eldest earl of Somerset<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 365. Walsingham, p. 352.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE wars, meanwhile, which Richard had inherited
with his crown, still continued; tho' interrupted by fre∣quent
truces, according to the practice of that age, and
conducted with little vigour, by reason of the weakness
of all parties. The French war was scarce heard of;
the tranquillity of the northern borders was only inter∣rupted
by one inroad of the Scots, which proceeded
more from a rivalship between the two martial families
of Piercy and Douglas, than from, any national quarrel:
A fierce battle or skirmish was fought at Otterborne<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">15th August, 1388.</NOTE>,
<PB N="28" REF="36"/>
in which young Piercy, sirnamed <HI>Hotspur,</HI> from his im∣petuous
valour, was taken prisoner, and Douglas slain;
and the victory remained undecided<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roissart, liv. 3. chap. 124, 125, 126. Walsingham, p. 355.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1394.</NOTE> Some insurrections
of the Irish obliged the King to make an expedition into
that country, which he reduced to obedience; and he
recovered, in some degree, by this enterprize, his cha∣racter
of courage, which had suffered a little by the in∣activity
of his reign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1396.</NOTE> At last, the English and French
courts began to think in earnest of a lasting peace; but
found it so difficult to adjust their opposite pretensions,
that they were contented to establish a truce of twenty∣five
years<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vii. P. 820.</NOTE>: Brest and Cherbourg were restored, the
former to the duke of Brittany, the latter to the King
of Navarre: Both parties were left in possession of all
the other places which they held at present: And to
render the amity between the two crowns more durable,
Richard, who was now a widower, was affianced to
Isabella, the daughter of Charles<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 811.</NOTE>. This princess was
only seven years of age; but the King agreed to so un∣equal
a match, chiefly that he might fortify himself,
by this alliance, against the enterprizes of his uncles and
the incurable turbulency as well as inconstancy of his
barons.</P>
<P>THE administration of the King, tho' it was not, in
this interval, sullied by any unpopular act, except the
seizure of the charter of London<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 727. Walsingham, p. 347.</NOTE>, which was soon
after restored, had not tended much to fortify his autho∣rity;
and his presonal character brought him into con∣tempt,
even while his public government appeared in a
good measure unexceptionable. Indolent, expensive, ad∣dicted
to low pleasures; he spent his whole time in
feasting and jollity, and dissipated in idle show, or in
<PB N="29" REF="37"/>
bounty to favourites of no reputation, that revenue
which the people expected to see him employ in enter∣prizes
directed to public honour and advantage. He for∣got
his rank by admitting all men to his familiarity;
and he was not sensible, that their acquaintance with the
qualities of his mind was not able to impress them with
the respect which he neglected to perserve from his birth
and station. The earls of Kent and Huntington, his
half brothers, were his chief confidents and favourites;
and tho' he never devoted himself to them with so pro∣fuse
an affection as that with which he had been attached
to the duke of Ireland, it was easy for men to see that
every grace passed thro' their hands, and that the King
had rendered himself a mere cypher in the government.
The small regard, which the public bore to his person,
disposed them to murmur against his administration, and
to receive with greedy ears every complaint, which the
discontented or ambitious grandees suggested to them.</P>
<P>GLOCESTER soon perceived all the advantages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1397.</NOTE> which
this dissolute conduct gave him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cabals of the duke of Gloce∣ster.</NOTE> and finding, that both
resentment and jealousy on the side of his nephew still
prevented him from acquiring any ascendant over that
prince, he determined to cultivate his popularity with
the nation, and to revenge himself on those who eclipsed
him in favour and authority. He seldom appeared at
court or in council: He never declared his opinion but
in order to disapprove of the measures embraced by the
King and his favourites: And he courted the friendship
of every man, whom disappointments or private resent∣ment
had rendered an enemy to the administration. The
long truce with France was very unpopular with the
English, who breathed nothing but war against that hos∣tile
nation; and Glocester took care to encourage all the
vulgar prejudices, which prevailed on this subject. For∣getting
<PB N="30" REF="38"/>
the misfortunes, which attended the English arms
during the latter years of Edward; he made an invidi∣ous
comparison between the glories of that reign and the
inactivity of the present, and he lamented that Richard
should have degenerated so far from the heroic virtues,
by which his father and his grandfather were distinguished.
The military men were inflamed with a desire of war,
when they heard him talk of the signal victories formerly
obtained, and of the easy prey which might be made of
the French riches by the superior valour of the English:
The populace readily embraced the same sentiments:
And all men exclaimed, that this prince, whose councils
were so much neglected, was the true support of English
honour, and alone able to raise the nation to its former
power and splendor. His great abilities, his popular
manners, his princely extraction, his immense riches,
his high office of constable<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vii. p. 152.</NOTE>; all these advantages, not
a little assisted by his want of court-favour, gave him a
mighty authority in the kingdom, and rendered him ex∣tremely
formidable to Richard and his ministers.</P>
<P>FROISSART<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Liv. 4. chap. 86.</NOTE>, a contemporary author and very im∣partial,
but whose credit is somewhat impaired by his
want of exactness in material facts, ascribes to the duke
of Glocester more desperate views, and such as were
totally incompatible with the government and domestic
tranquillity of the nation. According to that historian,
he proposed to his nephew, Roger Mortimer, earl of
Marche, whom Richard had declared his successor,
to give him immediate possession of the throne, by the de∣position
of a prince, so unworthy of government and
authority: And when Mortimer declined this project,
he resolved to make a partition of the kingdom between
himself, his two brothers, and the earl of Arundel; and
to dispossess Richard entirely of the crown. The King,
<PB N="31" REF="39"/>
it is said, being informed of these designs, saw, that
either his own ruin or that of Glocester was inevitable;
and he resolved, by a hasty blow, to prevent the execu∣tion
of such destructive projects. This is certain, that
Glocester, by his own confession, had often affected to
speak contemptuously of the King's person and govern∣ment;
had deliberated concerning the lawfulness of
throwing off allegiance to him; and had even born part
in a secret conference, where his deposition was pro∣posed
and talked of, and determined<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 378. Tyrrel, vol. iii. part 2. p. 972, from the re∣cords. Parliamentary History, vol. i. p. 473. That this confession was genuine, and obtained without violence, may be entirely depended on. Judge Rickhill, who brought it over from Calais, was tried on that account, and acquitted in the first parliament of Henry IV. when Glocester's party was prevalent. His acquittal, notwithstanding his innocence, may even appear marvellous, considering the times. See Cotton, p. 393.</NOTE>: But it is reason∣able
to think, that his schemes were not so far advanced
as to make him think of their immediate execution. The
danger, probably, was still too distant to render a despe∣rate
remedy entirely necessary for the security of the go∣vernment.</P>
<P>BUT whatever opinion we may form of Glocester's
conspiracies, his aversion to the French truce and alliance
was public and avowed; and that court, which had now
a great influence over the King, pushed him to provide
for his own safety, by taking revenge of the dangerous
designs of his uncle. The resentment of his former vio∣lences
revived; the sense of his refractory and uncom∣pliant
behaviour was still recent; and a man, whose am∣bition
had once usurped royal authority, and who had
murdered all the faithful servants of the King, was
thought capable, on a favourable opportunity, of renew∣ing
the same treasonable enterprizes. The King's pre∣cipitate
temper admitted of no deliberation: He ordered
<PB N="32" REF="40"/>
Glocester to be unexpectedly arrested; to be hurried into
a ship which was lying in the river; and to be carried
over to Calais, where alone, he thought, that, by reason
of his numerous partizans, he could safely be detained
in custody<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 4. chap. 90. Walsing. p. 354.</NOTE>. The earls of Arundel and Warwic were
seized at the same time: The malecontents, so suddenly
deprived of their leaders, were astonished, and overawed:
And the concurrence of the dukes of Lancaster and York,
in those measures, with that of the earls of Derby and
Rutland, the sons of these princes<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. viii. p. 7.</NOTE>, bereaved them of
all possibility of resistance.</P>
<P>A PARLIAMENT was immediately summoned at West∣minster;<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th Sept.</NOTE>
and the King doubted not to find the peers,
and still more the commons, very compliant with his
will. This house had in a former parliament given him
very sensible proofs of their obedience<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">In the former parliament, the commons had shewn themselves in a disposition to be very complaisant to the King; yet there happened an incident in their proceedings, which is very curious, and shews us the state of the house in that period. The members were either country gentlemen, or merchants, who were assembled for a few days, and were entirely unacquainted with business; so that it was easy to lead them astray, and draw them into votes and resolutions very different from their settled purpose. A member had proposed some petitions concern∣ing the state of the nation; in which, among other things, the house recommended f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gality to the King, and for that purpose, desired, that the court should not be so much frequented as formerly with <HI>bishops</HI> and <HI>ladies.</HI> The King was displeased with this freedom: The commons very humbly craved pardon: He was not satisfied unless they would name the mover of that petition. It happened to be one Haxey, whom the parliament, in order to make atonement, condemned for this offence to die the death of a traitor. But the King, at the desire of the archbishop of Canterbury, and the prelates, pardoned him. When a parliament in those times, not agitated by any faction, and being at entire freedom, could be guilty of such monstrous extrava∣gance, it is easy to judge what might be expected from them in more trying situations. See Cotton's Abridg. p. 361, 362.</NOTE>; and the present
<PB N="33" REF="41"/>
suppression of Glocester's party made him still more as∣sured
of a favourable election. As a farther expedient
for that purpose, he is also said to have employed the
influence of the sheriffs; a practice which, as it was
then somewhat new, gave great umbrage, but which the
established authority of that assembly rendered afterwards
more familiar to the nation. Accordingly, the parlia∣ment
passed whatever acts the King was pleased to
dictate to them<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">The nobles brought numerous retainers with them to give them security, as we are told by Walsingham, p. 354. The King had a few Cheshire men for his guard.</NOTE>: They annulled forever the commission
which usurped upon the royal authority, and declared it
treasonable to attempt, in any future period, the revival
of any similar commission<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Statutes at large, 21 Richard II.</NOTE>: They abrogated all the acts,
which attainted the King's ministers, and which that
parliament who passed them, and the whole nation, had
sworn inviolably to maintain: And they declared the
general pardon then granted to be invalid, as extorted by
force, and never ratified by the free consent of the King.
Tho' Richard, after he resumed the government, and lay
no longer under constraint, had voluntarily, by procla∣mation,
confirmed that general indemnity; this circum∣stance
seemed not, in their eyes, to merit the least con∣sideration.
Even a particular pardon granted six years
after to the earl of Arundel, was annulled by par∣liament;
on pretence, that it was procured by surprize,
and that the King was not then acquainted with the de∣gree
of guilt incurred by that nobleman.</P>
<P>THE commons then entered an impeachment against
Fitz-Alan, archbishop of Canterbury, and brother to
Arundel, and accused him of his concurrence in pro∣curing
<PB N="34" REF="42"/>
the illegal commission, and in attainting the
King's ministers. The primate pleaded guilty; but as
he was protected by the ecclesiastical privileges, the
King was satisfied with a sentence, which banished him
the kingdom, and sequestered his temporalities<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 368.</NOTE>. An
appeal or accusation was presented against the duke of
Glocester, and the earls of Arundel and Warwic, by
the earls of Rutland, Kent, Huntington, Somerset, Sa∣lisbury,
and Nottingham, together with the lords Spen∣cer
and Scrope, and they were accused of the same
crimes which had been imputed to the archbishop, as
well as of their appearance against the King in a
hostile manner at Haringay-park. The earl of Arundel,
who was brought to the bar, very wisely confined all
his defence to the pleading both the general and parti∣cular
pardon of the King; but was over-ruled, con∣demned
and executed<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 377. Froissart, liv. 4. chap. 90. Walsing. p. 354.</NOTE>. The earl of Warwic, who
was also convicted of high treason, was, on account of
his submissive behaviour, pardoned as to his life, but
doomed to perpetual banishment in the Isle of Man.
No new acts of treason were imputed to either of these
noblemen. The only crimes, for which they were con∣demned,
were the old attempts against the crown, which
seemed to be obliterated, both by the distance of time,
and by repeated pardons<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Tyrrel, vol. iii. part 2. p. 968. from the records.</NOTE>. The reasons of this method
of proceeding, it is difficult to conjecture. The recent
conspiracies of Glocester seem certain from his own
consession: But perhaps, the King and ministry had
not, at that time, in their hands, any satisfactory proof
of their reality; perhaps, it was difficult to convict Arun∣del
and Warwic, of any concurrence in them; perhaps,
an enquiry into these conspiracies would have involved in
the guilt some of those great noblemen, who now con∣curred
<PB N="35" REF="43"/>
with the crown, and whom it was necessary to co∣ver
from all imputation; or perhaps, the King, according
to the genius of that age, was very indifferent about
saving even the appearances of justice and equity, and
was only solicitous by any means to ensure success in these
prosecutions. This point, like many others in antient
history, we are obliged to leave altogether undetermined.</P>
<P>A WARRANT was issued to the earl Mareschal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of the duke of Glocester.</NOTE> go∣vernor
of Calais, to bring over the duke of Glocester,
in order to his trial; but the governor returned for an∣swer,
that the duke had died suddenly of an apoplexy
in that fortress. Nothing could be more suspicious than
the time of that prince's death: It became immediately
the general opinion, that he was murdered by orders
from his nephew: In the subsequent reign undoubted
proofs were produced to parliament, that he had been
suffocated with pillows by his keepers<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 399, 400. Dugdale, vol. ii. p. 171.</NOTE>: And it appeared,
that the King, apprehensive lest the public trial and exe∣cution
of so popular a prince, and so near a relation,
might prove both dangerous and invidious, had taken
this base method of gratifying, and as he sancied, con∣cealing
his revenge upon him. Both parties, in their
successive triumphs, seem to have had no farther con∣cern
than that of retaliating upon their adversaries;
and neither of them were aware, that, in imitating,
they indirectly justified, as far as it lay in their power,
all the illegal violences of the opposite party.</P>
<P>THIS session concluded with the creation or advance∣ment
of several peers; the earl of Derby was made
duke of Hereford; the earl of Rutland, duke of Albe∣marle;
the earl of Kent, duke of Surrey; the earl of
Huntington, duke of Exeter; the earl of Nottingham,
duke of Norfolk; the earl of Somerset, marquis of Dor∣set;
<PB N="36" REF="44"/>
lord Spencer, earl of Glocester; Ralph Nevil, earl
of Westmoreland; Thomas Piercy, earl of Worcester;
William Scrope, earl of Wiltshire<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 370, 371.</NOTE>. The parliament,
after a session of twelve days, was then adjourned to
Shrewsbury. The King, before the departure of the
members, exacted of them an oath for the perpetual
maintenance and establishment of their acts, similar to
that which had formerly been required by the duke of
Glocester and his party, and which had already prov∣ed
so vain and fruitless.</P>
<P>BOTH King and parliament met in the same dispo∣sitions
at Shrewsbury.<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th Jan.</NOTE> So anxious was Richard for the
security of these acts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1398.</NOTE> that he obliged the lor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and com∣mons
to swear anew to them on the cross of Canter∣bury<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 371.</NOTE>; and he soon after procured a bull from the Pope,
by which they were, as he imagined, perpetually secured
and established<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 355.</NOTE>. The parliament, on the other hand,
conferred on him <HI>for life</HI> the duties on wool, wool-fells,
and leather, and granted him besides, a subsidy of one
whole tenth and fifteenth and of a half tenth and fifteenth.
They also reversed the attainder of Tresilian and the
other judges; and with the approbation of the present
judges, declared the answers, for which these magistrates
had been impeached, to be just and legal<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Statutes at large, 21 Rich. II.</NOTE>: And they
carried so far their retrospect as to reverse, on the peti∣tion
of the lord Spencer, earl of Glocester, the attainder
pronounced against the two Spencers in the reign of
Edward II<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 372.</NOTE>. The antient history of England is nothing
but a catalogue of reversals: Every thing is in fluctuation
and movement: One faction is continually undoing what
<PB N="37" REF="45"/>
was established by another: And the multiplied oaths,
which each party requires for the security of the pre∣sent
acts, betray a perpetual consciousness of their in∣stability.</P>
<P>THE parliament, before they were dissolved, elected
a committee of twelve lords and six commoners<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The names of the commissioners were the dukes of Lancaster, York, Albemarle, Surrey, and Exeter, the marquis of Dorset, the earls of March, Salisbury, Northumberland, Glocester, Winchester, and Wilt∣shire, John Bussey, Henry Green, John Russel, Robert Teye, Henry Chelmeswike, and John Golo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re. It is to be remarked, that the duke of Lancaster always concurred with the rest in all their proceedings, even in the banishment of his son, which was afterwards so much com∣plained of.</NOTE>, whom
they vested with the whole power both of lords and com∣mons,
and endowed with full authority to finish all bu∣siness,
which had been laid before the houses, and which
they had not had leisure to bring to a conclusion<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 372. Walsingham, p. 355.</NOTE>. This
was a very unusual concession; and tho' it was limited
in the object, might, either immediately or as a prece∣dent,
have proved dangerous to the constitution: But
the cause of that extraordinary measure was an event very
singular and unexpected, which engaged the attention
of the parliament.</P>
<P>AFTER the destruction of the duke of Glocester and
the heads of that party, a misunderstanding broke out
among those noblemen, who had joined in the prosecu∣tion;
and the King wanted either authority sufficient to
appease it, or foresight to prevent it. The duke of
Hereford appeared in parliament, and accused the duke
of Norfolk of having spoke to him, in private, many slan∣derous
words of the King, and of having imputed to his
majesty an intention of subverting and destroying many
of his principal nobility<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 372. Parliamentary history, vol. i. p. 490.</NOTE>. Norfolk denied the charge,
<PB N="38" REF="46"/>
gave Hereford the lie, and offered to prove his inno∣cence
by duel. The challenge was accepted: The time
and place of combat were appointed: And as the event
of this important trial by arms might require the inter∣position
of legislative authority, the parliament thought
it more suitable to delegate their power to a committee,
than to prolong the session beyond the usual time, which
custom and general convenience had prescribed to it<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">In the first year of Henry VI. when the authority of parliament was great, and when that assembly could least be suspected of lying un∣der violence, a like concession was made to the council from like mo∣tives of convenience. See Cotton, p. 564.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Hereford was certainly very little deli∣cate
in the point of honour, to betray a private conversa∣tion
to the ruin of the person who had entrusted him; and
we may thence be more inclined to believe the duke of
Norfolk's denial, than the other's asseveration. But
Norfolk had in these transactions betrayed an equal
neglect of honour, which brings him entirely to a level
with his antagonist. Tho' he had publickly joined with
the duke of Glocester and that party in all the former
violences put upon the King; and his name stands
among the appellants who accused the duke of Ireland
and the other ministers: Yet was he not ashamed
publickly to impeach his former associates for the very
crimes, which he had concurred with them in commit∣ting,
and his name encreases the list of those appellants
who brought them to a trial. Such were the principles
and practices of those antient knights and barons during
the prevalence of the feudal government, and the reign
of chivalry.</P>
<P>THE lists for this decision of truth and right were ap∣pointed
at Coventry before the King: All the nobility
of England bandied into parties, and adhered either to
the one duke or the other: The whole nation was held
<PB N="39" REF="47"/>
in suspence with regard to the event: But when the two
champions appeared in the field, accoutered for the
combat, the King interposed to prevent, both the pre∣sent
effusion of such noble blood, and the future conse∣quences
of the quarrel. By the advice and authority of
the parliamentary commissioners, he stopped the duel;
and to show his impartiality, he ordered, by the same au∣thority, both the combatants to leave the kingdom<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 380. Walsingham, p. 356.</NOTE>, as∣signing
one country for the place of Norfolk's exile,
which he declared perpetual, and another for that of
Hereford, which he limited to ten years.</P>
<P>HEREFORD was a man of great prudence and command
of temper; and he behaved himself with so much sub∣mission
in these delicate circumstances, that the King,
before his departure, promised to shorten the term of his
exile four years; and he also granted him letters patent,
by which he was empowered, in case any inheritance
should in the mean time fall to him, to enter imme∣diately
in possession, and to postpone the doing homage
till his return.</P>
<P>THE weakness and fluctuation of Richard's councils
appear no where more evident than in the conduct of this
affair.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Banishment of Henry duke of Hereford.</NOTE> No sooner had Henry left the kingdom, than
the King's jealousy of the immense power and riches of
that family revived; and he was sensible, that, by
Glocester's death, he had only removed a counterpoize
to the Lancastrian interest, which was now become for∣midable
to his crown and kingdom. Being informed,
that Hereford had opened a treaty of marriage with the
daughter of the duke of Berry, uncle to the French
King, he determined to prevent the finishing of an alliance,
which would extend so much the interest of that noble∣man
into foreign countries; and he sent over the earl of
<PB N="40" REF="48"/>
Salisbury to Paris with a commission for that purpose.
The death of the duke of Lancaster, which happened
soon after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1399.</NOTE> called upon him to take new resolutions with
regard to that opulent succession.<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d Feb.</NOTE> The present duke, in
consequence of the King's patent, desired to be put in
possession of the estate and jurisdictions of his father:
But Richard, afraid of strengthening the hands of a man,
whom he had already so sensibly injured, applied to the
parliamentary commissioners, and persuaded them that
this affair was but an appendage of that business,
which the parliament had delegated to them. By
their authority, he revoked his letters patent, and re∣tained
possession of the estate of Lancaster: And by the
same authority, he seized and tried the duke's attorney,
who had procured and insisted on the letters, and had
him condemned as a traitor, for faithfully executing that
trust to his master<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Tyrrel, vol. iii. part 2. p. 991, from the records.</NOTE>. A most extravagant act of power<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
even tho' the King changed, in favour of the attorney,
the penalty of death into that of banishment.</P>
<P>HENRY, the new duke of Lancaster, had long ac∣quired,
by his conduct and abilities, the esteem of the
public; and having served with distinction against the
insidels in Lithuania, he had joined to his other praises
those of piety and valour, virtues which have at all times
a great influence over mankind, and were, during those
ages, the qualities chiefly held in estimation<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 343.</NOTE>. He was
connected with most of the principal nobility by blood,
alliances, or friendship; and as the injury, done him by
the King, might in its consequences affect all of them,
he easily brought them, by a sense of common interest,
to take part in his resentment. The people, who must
have an object of affection, and who found nothing in
the King's person, which they could love or revere,
<PB N="41" REF="49"/>
and were even disgusted with many parts of his conduct<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">He levied fines from those who had ten years before joined the duke of Glocester and his party: They were obliged to pay him mo∣ney, before he would allow them to enjoy the benefit of the indemnity; and in the articles of charge against him, it is asserted, that the pay∣ment of one fine did not suffice. It is indeed likely, that his ministers would abuse the power put into their hands; and this grievance ex∣tended to very many people. Historians agree in representing this prac∣tice as a great oppression. See Otterburn, p. 199.</NOTE>,
easily transferred to Henry that attachment, which the
death of the duke of Glocester had left without any fixed
direction. His misfortunes were lamented; the in∣justice,
which he had suffered, complained of; and all
men turned their eyes towards him, as the only person
who could retrieve the lost honour of the nation, or re∣dress
the supposed abuses of the government.</P>
<P>WHILE such was the disposition of the people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Return of Henry.</NOTE> Richard
had the imprudence to embark for Ireland, in order to
revenge the death of his cousin, Roger earl of Marche,
the presumptive heir of the crown, who had lately been
slain in a skirmish by the natives; and he thereby left
the kingdom of England open to the attempts of his pro∣voked
and ambitious enemy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th July.</NOTE> Henry, embarking at
Nantz with a retinue of sixty persons, among whom
were the archbishop of Canterbury and the young earl
of Arundel, nephew to that prelate, landed at Ravenspur
in Yorkshire; and was immediately joined by the earls
of Northumberland and Westmoreland, two of the most
potent barons in England. He here took a solemn oath,
that he had no other purpose in this invasion, than to
recover the dutchy of Lancaster, unjustly detained from
him; and he invited all his friends in England, and all
lovers of their country, to second him in this reasonable
and moderate pretension. Every place was in commo∣tion:
The malecontents in all quarters flew to arms:
London discovered the strongest symptoms of its dispo∣sition
<PB N="42" REF="50"/>
to mutiny and rebellion: And Henry's army, en∣creasing
on every day's march, soon amounted to the
number of 60,000 men.</P>
<P>THE duke of York was left guardian of the realm;<NOTE PLACE="marg">General in∣surrection.</NOTE> a
place to which his birth intitled him, but which both his
slender abilities, and his natural connexions with the duke
of Lancaster, rendered him utterly incapable of filling in
such a dangerous emergency. All the chief nobility,
who were attached to the crown, and who could either
have seconded the guardian's good intentions, or have
overawed his infidelity, had attended the King into Ire∣land;
and the efforts of Richard's friends were every
where more feeble than those of his enemies. The duke
of York, however, appointed the rendezvous of his
forces at St. Albans, and soon assembled an army of
40,000 men; but found them entirely destitute of zeal
and attachment to the royal cause, and more inclined to
join the party of the rebels. He hearkened therefore
very readily to a message from Henry, who entreated
him not to oppose a loyal and humble supplicant in the
recovery of his legal patrimony; and the guardian even
declared publickly that he would second his nephew in so
reasonable a request. His army, embraced with accla∣mations
the same party; and the duke of Lancaster, re∣inforced
by their numbers, was now intirely master of
the kingdom. He hastened to Bristol, into which some
of the King's ministers had thrown themselves; and soon
obliging that place to surrender, he yielded to the cries
of the populace, and without giving them a trial, order∣ed
the earl of Wiltshire, Sir John Bussy, and Sir Henry
Green, whom he there took prisoners, to be led out to
immediate execution.</P>
<P>THE King, receiving intelligence of this invasion
and insurrection, hastened over from Ireland, and landed
in Milford Haven with a body of 20,000 men: But
<PB N="43" REF="51"/>
even this army, so much inferior to the enemy, were
either overawed by the general combination of the king∣dom,
or seized with the same spirit of rebellion; and
they gradually deserted him, till he found that he had
not above 6000 men, who followed his standard. It ap∣peared,
therefore, necessary to retire secretly from this
small body, which served only to expose him to danger;
and he fled to the isle of Anglesea, where he purposed to
embark either for Ireland or France, and there await
the favourable opportunities, which the return of his
subjects to a sense of duty, or their future discontents
against the duke of Lancaster, would probably afford him.
Henry, sensible of this danger, sent to him the earl of
Northumberland with the strongest professions of loyalty
and submission; and that nobleman, by treachery and
false oaths, made himself master of the King's person,
and carried him to his enemy at Flint Castle. Richard
was conducted to London,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st Septr.</NOTE> by the duke of Lancaster,
who was there received with the acclamations of the mu∣tinous
populace. It is pretended, that the recorder met
him on the road; and in the name of the city, entreated
him, for the public safety, to put Richard to death, with
all his adherents who were prisoners<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Walsingham.</NOTE>; but the duke
very prudently determined to make many others par∣ticipate
of his guilt, before he would proceed to those
extremities. For this purpose, he issued writs of elec∣tion
in the King's name, and appointed the immediate
meeting of a parliament at Westminster.</P>
<P>SUCH of the peers, as were the most devoted to the
King, were either fled or imprisoned; and no opponents,
even among the barons, dared to appear against Henry
amid that scene of outrage and violence, which com∣monly
attends revolutions, more especially in England
during those turbulent ages: And it is also easy to ima∣gine,
<PB N="44" REF="52"/>
that a house of commons, elected during this uni∣versal
serment, and this triumph of the Lancastrian
Party, would be extremely attached to that cause, and
ready to second every suggestion of their leader. That
order, being as yet of too little weight to stem the tor∣rent,
was always carried along with it, and served only
to encrease the violence, which the public interest re∣quired
it should endeavour to controul. The duke of
Lancaster therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deposition of the King.</NOTE>, sensible that he would be entirely
master, began to carry his views to the crown itself; and
he deliberated with his partizans concerning the most
proper means of effecting his violent purpose. He first
extorted a resignation from Richard<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2744. Otterbourne. p. 212.</NOTE>; but as he knew,
that that deed would plainly appear the result of force and
fear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th Sept.</NOTE> he also proposed, notwithstanding the danger of the
precedent to himself and his posterity, to have him so∣lemnly
deposed in parliament for his pretended tyranny
and misconduct. A charge, consisting of thirty-three
articles, was accordingly drawn up against him, and pre∣sented
to that assembly<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Tyrrel, vol. iii. part 2. p. 1008, from the records. Knyghton, p. 2746. Otterbourne, p. 214.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IF we examine these articles, which are expressed with
extreme acrimony against Richard, we shall find, that,
except some rash speeches, which are imputed to him<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Art. 15. 26.</NOTE>,
and of whose reality, as they are said to have passed in
private conversation, we may very reasonably entertain
some doubt; the chief amount of the charge is contained
in his violent conduct during the two last years of his
reign, and naturally divides itself into two principal heads.
The first and most considerable is the revenge, which he
took on the princes and great barons, who had formerly
usurped, and still persevered in controuling and threat∣ning
<PB N="45" REF="53"/>
his authority; the second is the violation of the
laws and general privileges of his people. But the for∣mer,
however irregular in many of its circumstances, was
fully supported by authority of parliament, and was but
a copy of the violence, which the princes and barons
themselves, during their former triumph, had exercised
against him and his party. The detention of Lancaster's
estate was, properly speaking, a revocation, by the ap∣pearance
at least of parliamentary authority, of a grace,
which the King himself had formerly granted him. The
murder of Glocester (for the secret execution, however
merited, of that prince, certainly deserves this appellation)
was a private deed, formed not any precedent, and
implied not any assumed or arbitrary power of the
crown, which could justly give umbrage to the people.
It was really the effect of the King's weakness, rather
than ambition; and proves, that, instead of being dan∣gerous
to the constitution, he possessed not even the au∣thority
requisite for the execution of the laws.</P>
<P>THE second head of accusation, as it consists mostly
of general facts, was framed by Richard's inveterate
enemies, and was never allowed to be answered by him
or his friends; it is more difficult to form a judgment
of. The greatest part of these grievances, objected to
Richard, seems to be the exertion of arbitrary preroga∣tives;
such as the dispensing power<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Art. 13. 17, 18.</NOTE>, levying purvey∣ance<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Art, 22.</NOTE>, employing the marshal's court<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Art. 27.</NOTE>, extorting loans<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Art. 14.</NOTE>,
granting protections from law-suits<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Art. 16.</NOTE>; prerogatives,
which, though often complained of, had often been exer∣cised
by his predecessors, and still continued to be so by
his successors. But whether his irregular acts of this
kind were more frequent and injudicious and violent than
usual, or were only laid hold of and more exaggerated,
<PB N="46" REF="54"/>
by the factions, to which the weakness of his reign had
given birth, we are not able at this distance to determine
with certainty. There is however one circumstance, in
which his conduct is visibly different from that of his
grandfather: He is not accused of having imposed one
arbitrary tax, without consent of parliament, during his
whole reign<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">We learn from Cotton, p. 362. that the King, by his chancellor, told the commons, <HI>that they were sunderly bound to him, and namely in for∣bearing to charge them with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sines and fifteens, the which he meant</HI> no more <HI>to charge them in his own person.</HI> These words <HI>no more</HI> allude to the prac∣tice of his predecessors: He had not himself imposed any arbitrary taxes: Even the parliament, in the articles of his deposition, tho they complain of heavy taxes, affirm not, that they were imposed ille∣gally or by arbitrary will.</NOTE>: Scarce a year passed during the reign of
Edward, which was free from complaints with regard to
this grievous and dangerous exertion of authority. But,
perhaps, the great ascendant, which Edward had ac∣quired
over his people, together with his great prudence,
enabled him to make a use very advantageous to his sub∣jects
of this and other arbitrary prerogatives, and ren∣dered
them a smaller grievance in his hands, than a less
absolute authority in those of his grandson. This is a
point, which it would be rash for us to decide positively
on either side; but it is certain, that a charge drawn
up by the duke of Lancaster, and assented to by a par∣liament,
situated in these circumstances, forms no man∣ner
of presumption with regard to the unusual irregula∣rity
or violence of the King's conduct in this parti∣cular<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">To show how little credit is to be given to this charge against Ri∣chard, we may observe, that a law in the 13 Edw. III. had been made against the continuance of sheriffs for more than one year: But the inconvenience of changes having afterwards appeared from expe∣rience, the commons in the twentieth of this King, applied by petition that the sheriffs might be continued; tho' that petition had not been enacted into a statute, by reason of other disagreeable circumstances, which attended it. See Cotton, p. 361. It was certainly a very mo∣derate exercise of the dispensing power for the king to continue the sheriffs, after he found that that practice would be acceptable to his subjects, and had been applied for by one house of parliament: Yet is this made an article of charge against him by the present parliament. See art. 18. Walsingham, speaking of a period early in Richard's mi∣nority, says, <HI>But what do acts of parliament signify, when, after they are made, they take no effect; since the King, by the advice of the privy-council, takes upon him to alter, or wholly set aside, all those things, which by general consent had been ordained in parliament?</HI> If Richard, therefore, exercised the dispensing power, he was warranted by the examples of his uncles and grandfather, and indeed of all his predecessors from Henry III.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN the charge against Richard was presented to
the parliament, tho' it was liable, almost in every article,
<PB N="47" REF="55"/>
to objections, it was not canvassed, nor examined, nor
disputed in either house, and seemed to be received with
unanimous approbation. One man alone, the bishop of
Carlisle, had the courage, amidst this universal disloyalty
and violence, to appear in defence of his unhappy ma∣ster,
and to plead his cause against all the power of the
prevailing party. Tho' some topics, employed by that
virtuous prelate, may seem to favour too much the doc∣trine
of passive obedience, and to make too large a sa∣crifice
of the rights of mankind; he was naturally push∣ed
into that extreme by his abhorrence of the present li∣centious
factions; and such intrepidity, as well as disin∣terestedness
of behaviour, proves, that, whatever his
speculative principles were, his heart was elevated far
above the meanness and abject submission of a slave. He
represented to the parliament, that all the abuses of go∣vernment,
which could justly be imputed to Richard,
far from amounting to tyranny, were merely the result
of error, youth, or misguided council, and admitted of
a remedy, more easy and saluta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than a total fubversion
of the constitution. That even had they been much more
violent and dangerous, than they really were, they had
chieflly proceeded from former examples of resistance,
<PB N="48" REF="56"/>
which, making the prince sensible of his precarious situa∣tion,
had obliged him to establish his throne by irregular
and arbitrary expedients. That a rebellious disposition in
subjects was the principal cause of tyranny in Kings: Laws
could never secure the subject, which did not give secu∣rity
to the sovereign: And if the maxim of inviolable
loyalty, which formed the basis of the English govern∣ment,
were once rejected, the privileges, belonging to
the several orders of the state, instead of being fortified
by that licentiousness, would thereby lose the surest foun∣dation
of their force and ftability. That the parliamen∣tary
deposition of Edward II. far from making a pre∣cedent,
which could controul this maxim, was only the
example of successful violence; and it was sufficiently
to be lamented, that crimes were so often committed in
the world, without establishing principles which might
justify and authorize them. That even that precedent,
false and dangerous as it was, could never warrant the
present excesses, which were so much greater, and which
would entail distraction and misery on the nation, to
their latest posterity. That the succession, at least, of
the crown, was then preserved inviolate: The lineal
heir was placed on the throne: And the people had an
opportunity, by their legal obedience to him, of making
atonement for the violences which they had committed
against his predecessor. That a descendant of Lionel,
duke of Clarence, the elder brother of the late duke of
Lancaster, had been declared in parliament successor
to the crown: He had left posterity: And their title,
however it might be overpowered by present force and
saction, could never be obliterated from the minds of the
people. That if the turbulent disposition alone of the
nation, had overturned the well-established throne of so
good a prince as Richard; what bloody commotions
must ensue, when the same cause was united to the mo∣tive
of restoring the legal and undoubted heir to his
<PB N="49" REF="57"/>
authority? That the new government, intended to be
established, would stand on no principles; and would
scarce retain any pretence, by which it could challenge
the obedience of men of sense or virtue. That the claim
of lineal descent was so gross as scarcely to deceive the
most ignorant of the populace: Conquest could never
be pleaded by a rebel against his sovereign: The con∣sent
of the people had no authority in a monarchy not
derived from consent, but established by hereditary right;
and however the nation might be justified, in deposing
the misguided Richard, it could never have any reason
for passing by his lawful heir and successor, who was
plainly innocent. And that the duke of Lancaster
would give them but a bad specimen of the legal mode∣ration,
which might be expected from his future go∣vernment,
if he added, to the crime of his past rebellion,
the guilt of excluding the family, which, both by right
of blood, and by declaration of parliament, would, in
case of Richard's decease, or voluntary resignation, have
been received as the undoubted heirs of the mo∣narchy<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Sir John Heywarde, p. 101.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALL the circumstances of this event, compared to
those attending the late revolution in 1688, show the
difference between a great and civilized nation, delibe∣rately
vindicating its established privileges, and a tur∣bulent
and barbarous aristocracy, plunging headlong
from the extremities of one faction into those of an∣other.
This noble freedom of the bishop of Carlisle,
instead of being applauded, was not so much as to∣lerated:
He was immediately arrested, by orders of the
duke of Lancaster, and sent a prisoner to the abbey of
St. Albans. No farther debate was attempted: Thirty∣three
long articles of charge were, in one meeting, voted
<PB N="50" REF="58"/>
against Richard; and voted unanimously by the same
peers and prelates, who, a little before, had voluntarily
and unanimously authorized those very acts of violence,
of which they now complained. That prince was de∣posed
by the suffrages of both houses; and the throne
being now vacant, the duke of Lancaster stepped forth,
and having crossed himself on his forehead, and on his
breast, and called upon the name of Christ<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 389.</NOTE>, he pro∣nounced
these words, which we shall give in the original
language, because of their singularity.</P>
<P>In the name of Fadher, Son, and Holy Ghost, I Henry
of Lancaster, challenge this rewme of Ynglande, and the
croun, with all the membres, and the appurtenances; als I
that am descendit by right line of the blode, coming fro the
gude King Henry therde, and throge that right that God of
his grace hath sent me, with helpe of kyn, and of my frendes
to recover it; the which rewme was in poynt to be ondone by
defaut of governance, and ondoying of the gude lawes<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2757.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN order to understand this speech, it must be observed,
that there was a silly story, received among some of the
lowest vulgar, that Edmond earl of Lancaster, son of
Henry III. was really the elder brother of Edward I;
but that, by reason of some deformities in his person, he
had been postponed in the succession, and his younger
brother imposed on the nation in his stead. As the pre∣sent
duke of Lancaster inherited from Edmond by his mo∣ther,
this genealogy made him the true heir of the mo∣narchy;
and it is therefore insinuated in Henry's speech:
But the absurdity was too gross to be openly avowed ei∣ther
by him, or by the parliament. The case is the
same with regard to his right of conquest: He was a
subject who rebelled against his sovereign: He entered
the kingdom with a retinue of no more than sixty per∣sons:
<PB N="51" REF="59"/>
He could not therefore be the conqueror of Eng∣land;
and this right is accordingly insinuated, not avowed.
Still there is a third claim, derived from his merits in
saving the nation from tyranny and oppression; and this
claim is also insinuated: But as it seemed, by its nature,
better calculated as a reason for his being <HI>elected</HI> King by
a free choice, which he was determined never to avow,
than for giving him an immediate right of possession, he
durst not speak openly even on this head; and to obviate
any notion of election, he challenges the crown as his due,
either by acquisition or inheritance. The whole forms
such a piece of jargon and nonsense, as is almost with∣out
example: No objection however was made to it in
the parliament: The unanimous voice of lords and com∣mons
placed Henry on the throne: He became King,
nobody could tell how or wherefore: The title of the
house of Marche, formerly recognized by parliament,
was neither invalidated nor repealed; but passed over in
total silence: And as a concern for the liberties of the
people seems to have had no hand in this revolution,
their right to dispose of the government, as well as all
their other privileges, was left precisely on the same foot∣ing
as before. But Henry, having, when he claimed the
crown, dropped some obscure hint concerning conquest,
which, it was thought, might endanger these privileges,
he soon after made a public declaration, that he did not
thereby intend to deprive any one of his franchises or li∣berties<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2759. Otterborn, p. 220.</NOTE>:
Which was the only circumstance, that had
common sense or meaning, in all these transactions.</P>
<P>THE subsequent events discover the same headlong
violence of conduct,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th oct.</NOTE> and the same rude notions of civil
government. The deposition of Richard dissolved the
parliament: It was necessary to summon a new one:
<PB N="52" REF="60"/>
And Henry, in six days after, called together, without
any new election, the same members; and this assembly
he denominated a new parliament. They were employed
in the usual task of reversing every deed of the opposite
party. All the acts of the last parliament of Richard,
which had been confirmed by their oaths, and by a
papal bull, were abrogated: All the acts, which had
passed in the parliament where Glocester prevailed, and
which had been abrogated by Richard, were again re∣established<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 390.</NOTE>: The answers of Tresillian, and the other
judges, which a parliament had annulled, but which
a new parliament and new judges had approved, here re∣ceived
a second condemnation. The peers, who had ac∣cused
Glocester, Arundel, and Warwic, and who had
received higher titles for that piece of service, were all of
them degraded from their new dignities: Even the prac∣tice
of prosecuting appeals in parliament was wholly abo∣lished;
and trials were restored to the course of common
law<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Henry iv. cap. 14.</NOTE>. The natural effect of this conduct was to render
the people giddy with such rapid and perpetual changes,
and to make them lose all notions of right and wrong
in the measures of government.</P>
<P>THE earl of Northumberland made a motion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d Oct.</NOTE> in the
house of peers, with regard to the unhappy prince whom
they had deposed. He asked them, what advice they
would give the King for the future treatment of him;
since Henry was resolved to spare his life. They unani∣mously
replied, that he should be imprisoned under a secure
guard, in some secret place, and should be deprived of all
commerce with any of his friends or partizans. It was
easy to foresee, that he would not remain long alive in
the hands of such barbarous and sanguinary enemies.
Historians differ with regard to the manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of the King.</NOTE>, in which he
<PB N="53" REF="61"/>
was murdered. It was long the prevailing opinion, that
Sir Piers Exton, and others of his guards, fell upon him
in the castle of Pomfret, where he was confined, and dis∣patched
him with their halberts. But it is more probable,
that he was starved to death in prison; and after all sub∣sistence
was denied him, he prolonged his unhappy life,
it is said, for a fortnight, before he reached the end of
his miseries. This account is more consistent with the
story, that his body was exposed in public, and that no
marks of violence were observed upon it. He died in
the thirty-fourth year of his age, and the twenty-third of
his reign. He left no posterity, either legitimate or ille∣gitimate.</P>
<P>ALL the writers, who have transmitted to us the hi∣s∣tory
of Richard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His charac∣ter.</NOTE> composed their works during the reigns
of the Lancastrian princes; and candor requires, that we
should not give entire credit to the reproaches which have
been thrown upon his memory. But after making all
proper abatements, he still appears to have been a weak
prince, and unfit for government, less for want of na∣tural
parts and capacity, than of solid judgment and a
good education. He was violent in his temper, profuse
in his expences; fond of idle show and magnificence;
devoted to favourites, and addicted to pleasure: Passions,
all of them, the most inconsistent with a prudent oeco∣nomy,
and consequently dangerous in a limited and
mixed government. Had he possessed the talents of gain∣ing,
and still more those of over-awing, his great barons,
he might have escaped all the misfortunes of his reign,
and been allowed to carry much farther his oppressions
over the people, if he really was guilty of any, without
their daring to rebel, or even to murmur against him.
But when the grandees were tempted, by his want of
prudence and of vigour, to resist his authority, and execute
the most violent enterprizes upon him, he was naturally
<PB N="54" REF="62"/>
led to seek for an opportunity of retaliation; justice was
neglected; the lives of the chief nobility sacrificed; and
all these evils seem to have proceeded less from a settled
design of establishing arbitrary power, than from the in∣solence
of victory, and the necessities of the King's situa∣tion.
The manners indeed of the age were the chief
source of such violences: Laws, which were feebly exe∣cuted
in peaceable times, lost all their authority during
public convulsions: Both parties were alike guilty: Or
if any difference may be remarked between them, we
shall find, that the authority of the crown, being more
legal, was commonly carried, when it prevailed, to less
desperate extremities, than those of the aristocracy.</P>
<P>ON comparing the conduct and events of this reign,
with those of the preceding, we shall find equal reason
to admire Edward, and to blame Richard; but the cir∣cumstance
of opposition, surely, will not lie in the strict
regard paid by the former to national privileges, and the
neglect of them by the latter. On the contrary, the
prince of small abilities, as he felt his want of power,
seems to have been always more moderate in this respect
than the other. Every parliament, assembled during the
reign of Edward, remonstrate against the exertion of
some arbitrary prerogative or other: We hear not any
complaints of that kind during the reign of Richard, till
the assembling of his last parliament, which was sum∣moned
by his inveterate enemies, which dethroned him,
which framed their complaints during the time of the
most furious convulsions, and whose testimony can there∣fore
have, on that account, much less authority with
every equitable judge<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Compare, in this view, the abridgment of the records, by Sir Robert Cotton, during these two reigns.</NOTE>. Both these princes experienced
the encroachments of the Great upon their authority.
Edward, reduced to necessities, was obliged to make
<PB N="55" REF="63"/>
an express bargain with his parliament, and to sell some
of his prerogatives for present supply; but as they were
acquainted with his genius and capacity, they ventured
not to demand any exorbitant concessions, or such as
were incompatible with regal and sovereign power:
The weakness of Richard tempted the parliament to
extort a commission, which in a manner dethroned the
prince, and transferred the sceptre into the hands of the
nobility. The events were also suitable to the character
of each. Edward had no sooner got the supply, than
he departed from the engagements, which had induced
the parliament to grant it; he openly told his people,
that he had but <HI>dissembled</HI> with them when he seemed to
make them these concessions; and he resumed and re∣tained
all his prerogatives. But Richard, because he
was detected in consulting and deliberating with the
judges on the lawfulness of restoring the constitution,
found his barons immediately in arms against him; was
deprived of his liberty; saw his favourites, his ministers,
his tutor, butchered before his face, or banished and at∣tainted;
and was obliged to give way to all this violence.
There cannot be a more remarkable opposition between
the fortunes of two princes: It were happy for society,
that this opposition depended always on the justice or
injustice of the measures which men embrace; and not
rather on the different degrees of prudence and vigour,
with which these measures are supported.</P>
<P>THERE was a sensible decay of the authority of the
ecclesiastics during this period.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Miscellan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ous trans∣actions during this reign.</NOTE> The disgust, which the
laity had received from the numerous usurpations both
of the court of Rome, and of their own clergy, had
weaned the kingdom very much from superstition; and
strong symptoms appeared, from time to time, of a ge∣neral
desire to shake off the bondage of the Romish
church. In the committee of eighteen, to whom
<PB N="56" REF="64"/>
Richard's last parliament delegated their whole power,
there is not the name of one ecclesiastic to be found;
a neglect which is almost without example, while the
catholic religion subsisted in England<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The following passage in Cotton's abridgment, p. 196, shows a strange prejudice against the church and churchmen. <HI>The commons after∣wards coming into the parliament, and making their protestation, shewed, that for want of good redress about the King's person in his houshold, in all his courts, touching maintainers in every county, and purveyors, the commons were daily pilled, and nothing defended against the enemy, and that it should shortly deprive the King and undo the state. Wherefore in the same government, they entirely require redress. Whereupon the King appointed sundry bishops, lords and nobles, to sit in privy council about these matters: Who since that they must begin at the head and go at the request of the commons, they in the presence of the King charged his confessor not to come into the court but upon the four principal festivals.</HI> We should little expect that a Popish privy council, in order to preserve the King's morals, should order his confessor to be kept at a distance from him. This incident happened in the minority of Richard. As the popes had for a long time resided at Avignon, and the majority of the sacred college were Frenchmen, this circumstance naturally en∣creased the aversion of the nation to the papal power: But the preju∣dice against the English clergy cannot be accounted for from that cause.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE aversion entertained against the established church
soon found principles and tenets, and reasonings, by
which it could justify and support itself. John Wick∣liffe,
a secular priest, educated at Oxford, began, in the
latter end of Edward III. to spread the doctrines of re∣formation
by his discourses, sermons and writings; and
he made many disciples among men of all ranks and sta∣tions.
He seems to have been a man of parts and learn∣ing;
and has the honour of being the first person in Eu∣rope,
who publicly called in question those doctrines,
which had universally passed for certain and undisputed
during so many ages. Wickliffe himself, as well as his
disciples, who received the name of Wickliffites or Lol∣lards,
was distinguished by a remarkable austerity of life
and manners; a circumstance common to almost all those
<PB N="57" REF="65"/>
who dogmatize in any new way, both because men,
who draw to them the attention of the public, and ex∣pose
themselves to the odium of great multitudes, are
obliged to be very guarded in their conduct, and because
few, who have a strong propensity to pleasure or business,
will enter upon so difficult and laborious an undertaking.
The doctrines of Wickliffe, being derived from his
search into the scriptures and into ecclesiastical antiquity,
were nearly the same with those propagated by the re∣formers
in the sixteenth century: He only carried some
of them farther than was done by the more sober part
of these reformers. He denied the doctrine of the real
presence, the supremacy of the church of Rome, the
merit of monastic vows: He maintained, that the scrip∣ture
was the sole rule of faith; that the church was de∣pendant
on the state, and ought to be reformed by it;
that the clergy ought to possess no estates; that the beg∣ging
friars were a general nuisance, and ought not to
be supported<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 191. 208. 283, 284. Spelman concil. vol. ii. p. 630. Knyghton, p. 2657.</NOTE>; that the numerous ceremonies of the
church were hurtful to true piety: He asserted, that oaths
were unlawful, that dominion was founded in grace,
that every thing was subject to fate and destiny, and
that all men were predestinated either to eternal salva∣tion
or reprobation<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Harpsfield, p. 668. 673, 674. Waldens. tom. i. lib. 3. art. I. cap. 8.</NOTE>. From the whole of his doctrines,
Wickliffe appears to have been strongly tinctured with
enthusiasm, and to have been thereby the better qualified
to oppose a church, whose distinguishing character was
superstition.</P>
<P>THE propagation of these principles gave great alarm
to the clergy; and a bull was issued by Pope Gregory
XI. for taking Wickliffe into custody, and examining
<PB N="58" REF="66"/>
into the scope of his opinions<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Spelm. conc. vol. ii. p. 621. Walsingham, p. 201, 202, 203.</NOTE> Courteney, bishop of
London, cited him before his tribunal; but the reformer
had now got very powerful protectors, who screened him
from the ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The duke of Lan∣caster,
who then governed the kingdom, encouraged the
principles of Wickliffe; and he made no scruple, as well
as lord Piercy, the mareschal, to appear openly in court
with him, in order to give him countenance upon his
trial: He even insisted, that Wicklisse should sit in the
bishop's presence, while his principles were examined:
Courteney exclaimed against this insult: The mob of
London, thinking their prelate affronted, attacked the
duke and mareschal, who escaped from their hands with
some difficulty<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Harpsfield in Hist. Wickl. p. 683.</NOTE>. And the populace, soon after, broke
into the houses of both these noblemen, threatned their
persons, and plundered their goods. The bishop of
London had the merit of appeasing their fury and resent∣ment.</P>
<P>THE duke of Lancaster, however, still continued his
protection to Wickliffe, during the minority of Richard;
and the principles of that reformer had so far propagated
themselves, that when the Pope sent to Oxford a new
bull against these doctrines, the university deliberated for
some time, whether they should receive the bull; and
they never took any vigorous measures in consequence of
the papal orders<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Wood's Ant. Oxon. lib. I. p. 191, &amp;c. Walsingham, p. 201.</NOTE>. Even the populace of London were
at length brought to entertain favourable sentiments of
this reformer: When he was cited before a synod at
Lambeth, the mob broke into the assembly, and so
overawed the prelates, who found both the people and
the court against them, that they dismissed him without
any farther censures.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="67"/>
THE clergy, we may well believe, were more wanting
in power than inclination to punish this new heresy,
which struck at all their credit, possessions and authority.
But there was hitherto no law in England, by which the
secular arm was empowered to support orthodoxy; and
the ecclesiastics endeavoured to supply the defect by a very
extraordinary and very unwarrantable artifice. In the
year 1381, there was an act passed, enjoining sheriffs
to apprehend the preachers of heresy and their abettors;
but this statute had been surreptitiously obtained by the
clergy, and had the formality of an enrolment without
the consent of the commons. In the subsequent session,
the lower house complained of this fraud; affirmed,
that they had no intention to bind themselves to the pre∣lates
farther than their ancestors had done before them;
and required that the pretended statute should be re∣pealed,
which was done accordingly<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Cotton's abridgment, p. 285.</NOTE>. But it is remark∣able,
that, notwithstanding this vigilance of the com∣mons,
the clergy had so much art and influence, that the
repeal was suppressed, and the act, which never had
any legal authority, remains to this day upon the statute
book<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">5 Rich. II. chap. 5.</NOTE>: Tho' the clergy still thought proper to keep it
in reserve, and not proceed to the immediate execution
of it.</P>
<P>BUT besides the defect of power in the church, which
saved Wickliffe, that reformer himself, notwithstanding
his enthusiasm, seems not to have been actuated by the
spirit of martyrdom; and in all subsequent trials before
the prelates, he so explained away his doctrine by tor∣tured
meanings, as to render it quite innocent and inof∣fensive<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 206. Knyghton, p. 2655, 2656.</NOTE> Most of his followers imitated his cautious
disposition, and saved themselves either by recantations or
explanations. He died of a palsy in the year 1385 at his
<PB N="60" REF="68"/>
rectory of Lutterworth in the county of Leicester; and
the clergy, mortified that he should have escaped their
vengeance, took care, besides assuring people of his eternal
damnation, to represent his last distemper as a visible
judgment of heaven upon him for his multiplied heresies
and impieties<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 312. Ypod. Neust. p. 537.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE proselytes, however, of Wickliffe's opinions
still encreased in England<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2663.</NOTE>: Some monkish writers re∣present
the half of the kingdom as infected by those prin∣ciples:
They were carried over to Bohemia by some
youth of that nation, who studied in Oxford: But tho'
the age seemed strongly disposed to receive them, affairs
were not yet fully ripe for this great revolution; and the
finishing blow to ecclesiastical power was reserved to a
period of more curiosity, literature, and inclination for
novelties.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, the English parliament continued to
check the clergy and the court of Rome by more sober
and more legal expedients. They enacted anew the sta∣tute
of <HI>provisors,</HI> and affixed higher penalties to the
transgression of it, which, in some instances, was even
made capital<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">13 Rich. II. cap. 3. 16 Rich. II. cap. 4.</NOTE>. The court of Rome had fallen upon a
new device, which encreased their authority over the
prelates: The Pope, who found that the expedient of
arbitrarily depriving them was violent, and liable to op∣position,
attained the same end by transferring such of
them, as were obnoxious, to poorer sees, and even to
nominal sees, <HI>in partibus infidelium.</HI> It was thus that the
archbishop of York, and the bishops of Durham and
Chichester, the King's ministers, had been treated after
the prevalence of Glocester's faction: The good bishop
of Carlisle met with the same fate after the accession of
<PB N="61" REF="69"/>
Henry IV. For the Pope always joined with the pre∣vailing
powers, when they did not thwart his pretensions.
The parliament, in the reign of Richard, enacted a law
against this abuse: And the King made a general re∣monstrance
to the court of Rome against all those imposi∣tions,
which he calls <HI>horrible excesses</HI> of that court<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vii. p. 672.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was usual at this time for the church, that they
might elude the mortmain act, to make their votaries
leave lands in trust to certain persons, under whose
name the clergy enjoyed the benefit of the bequest:
The parliament also stopped the progress of this abuse<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 27. 38. Cotton, p. 355.</NOTE>.
In the 17th of the King, the commons prayed, <HI>that re∣medy
might be had against such religious persons as cause their
villains to marry free women inheritable, whereby the estate
comes to those religious hands by collusion</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 355.</NOTE>. This was a new
device of the clergy.</P>
<P>THE papacy was at this time somewhat weakened by
a schism, which lasted for forty years, and gave great
scandal to the devoted partizans of the holy see. After
the Popes had resided many years at Avignon, Gregory
XI. was persuaded to return to Rome; and upon his
death, which happened in 1380, the Romans, resolute
to fix, for the future, the seat of the papacy in Italy,
besieged the cardinals in the conclave, and constrained
them, tho' they were mostly Frenchmen, to elect Urban
VI. an Italian, into that high dignity. The French
cardinals, so soon as they recovered their liberty, fled
from Rome, and protesting against the forced election,
chose Robert, son of the count of Geneva, who took
the name of Clement VII. and resided at Avignon. All
the kingdoms of Christendom, according to their se∣veral
interests and inclinations, were divided between
<PB N="62" REF="70"/>
these two pontiffs. The court of France adhered to
Clement, and were followed by their allies, the King
of Castile, and King of Scotland: England of course
was thrown into the other party, and declared for Ur∣ban.
Thus the appellation of <HI>Clementines</HI> and <HI>Urbanists</HI>
distracted Europe for several years; and each party damned
the other as schismatics, and as rebels to the true vicar
of Christ. But this circumstance, tho' it weakened the
papal authority, had not so great an effect as might na∣turally
be imagined. Tho' any King could easily, at
first, make his kingdom embrace the party of one Pope
or the other, or even keep it some time in suspence be∣tween
them, he could not so easily transfer his obedience
at pleasure: The people attached themselves to their
own party as to a religious opinion; and conceived an
extreme abhorrence to the opposite party, whom they
regarded as little better than Saracens or infidels. Cru∣sades
were even undertaken in this quarrel; and the
zealous bishop of Norwich, in particular, led over, in
1382, near 60,000 bigots into Flanders against the Cle∣mentines;
but after losing a great part of his followers,
he returned with disgrace into England<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Froissart, lib. 2. chap. 133, 134. Walsingham, p. 298, 299, 300, &amp;c. Knyghton, p. 2671.</NOTE>. Each Pope,
sensible, from this prevailing spirit of the people, that
the kingdom, which once embraced his cause, would al∣ways
adhere to him, boldly maintained all the preten∣sions
of his see, and stood not much more in awe of
the sovereigns, than if his authority had not been en∣dangered
by a rival.</P>
<P>WE meet with this preamble to a law enacted at the
very beginning of this reign: “Whereas divers persons
of small garrison of land or other possessions do make
great retinue of people, as well of esquires as of
<PB N="63" REF="71"/>
others, in many parts of the realm, giving to them
hats and other livery of one suit by year, taking again
towards them the value of the same livery or percase
the double value, by such covenant and assurance, that
every of them shall maintain other in all quarrels, be
they reasonable or unreasonable, to the great mis∣chief
and oppression of the people, &amp;c<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">I Rich. II. chap. 7.</NOTE>”. This
preamble contains a true picture of the state of the king∣dom.
The laws had been so feebly executed, even during
the long, active, and vigilant reign of Edward III. that
no subject could trust to their protection. Men openly
associated themselves, under the patronage of some great
man, for their mutual defence. They had public badges
by which their confederacy was distinguished. They
supported each other in all quarrels, iniquities, extor∣tions,
murders, robberies, and other crimes. Their
chieftain was more their sovereign than the King himself;
and their own band was more connected with them than
their country. Hence the perpetual turbulence, disor∣ders,
factions, and civil wars of those times: Hence the
small regard paid to a character or the opinion of the
public: Hence the large discretionary prerogatives of the
crown, and the danger which might have ensued from
the too great limitation of them. If the King had pos∣sessed
no arbitrary powers, while all the nobles assumed
and exercised them, there must have ensued an absolute
anarchy in the state.</P>
<P>ONE great mischief, attending these confederacies,
was the extorting from the King pardons for the most
enormous crimes. The parliament often endeavoured,
in the last reign, to deprive the prince of this preroga∣tive;
but in the present, they were contented with an
<PB N="64" REF="72"/>
abridgement of it. They enacted, that no pardon for
rapes or murder from malice prepense should be valid,
unless the crime was particularly specified in it<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">13 Rich. II. chap. I.</NOTE>. There
were also some other circumstances required for the
passing any pardons of this kind: An excellent law;
but ill observed, like most laws, which thwart the man∣ners
of the people, and the prevailing customs of the
times.</P>
<P>IT is easy to observe, from these voluntary associations
among the people, that the whole force of the seudal
system was in a manner dissolved, and that the English
had nearly returned in that particular to the same situa∣tion
in which they stood before the Norman conquest.
It was indeed impossible, that that system could long sub∣sist,
under the constant revolutions, to which landed pro∣perty
is every where subject. When the great feudal
baronies were first erected, the lord lived in opulence in
the midst of his vassals: He was in a situation to pro∣tect
and cherish and defend them: The quality of pa∣tron
naturally united itself to that of superior: And
these two principles of authority mutually supported each
other. But when, by the various divisions and mixtures
of property, a man's superior came to live at a distance
from him, and could no longer give him shelter or coun∣tenance;
the tie gradually became more fictitious than
real: New connexions from neighbourhood or other
causes were formed: Protection was sought by voluntary
services and attachment: The appearance of valour, spi∣rit,
ability in any great man extended his interest very
far: And if the sovereign was deficient in these qualities,
he was equally, if not more exposed to the usurpations
of the aristocracy than even during the vigour of the
feudal system.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="73"/>
THE greatest novelty introduced into the civil go∣vernment
during this reign was the creation of peers
by patent. The lord Beauchamp of Holt was the first
peer, who was advanced to the house of lords in this
manner. The practice of levying benevolences is also
mentioned in this reign.</P>

<P>THE English had so long been familiarized to the
hereditary succession of their monarchy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Title of the King.</NOTE> the in∣stances
of departure from it had always born such
strong symptoms of injustice and violence, and so little
of a national choice or election, and the returns to the
true line had ever been deemed such fortunate incidents
in their history, that Henry was afraid, left, in resting
his title on the consent of the people, he should build on
a foundation, to which the people themselves were not
accustomed, and whose solidity they would with difficulty
be brought to recognize. The idea too of choice seemed
always to imply that of conditions, and a liberty of re∣calling
the consent upon any supposed violation of them;
an idea which was not naturally agreeable to a sovereign,
and might be dangerous to the people themselves, who,
lying so much under the influence of turbulent nobles,
had ever paid but a very imperfect obedience even to
their hereditary princes. For these reasons Henry was
determined never to have recourse to this claim; the
only one, on which his authority could consistently stand:
He chose rather to patch up his title in the best manner
he could from other pretensions: And in the end, he left
<PB N="67" REF="75"/>
himself, in the eyes of men of sense,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XVIII.</NOTE> no foundation of
right, but his present possession; a very precarious claim,
which, by its very nature, was liable to be overthrown
by every faction of the great, or prejudice of the people.
He had indeed a present advantage over his competitor:
The heir of the house of Mortimer, who had been de∣clared
in parliament the true heir of the crown, was a
boy of seven years of age<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, vol. i. p. 151.</NOTE>: His friends consulted his
safety by keeping silence with regard to his title: Henry
detained him and his younger brother in an honourable
custody at Windsor castle: But he had reason to dread,
that, in proportion as that nobleman grew to man's
estate, he would draw to him the attachment of the peo∣ple,
and make them reflect on the fraud, violence, and
injustice, by which he had been excluded from the
throne. Many favourable topics would occur in his be∣half:
He was born in the country; possessed an extensive
interest from the greatness and alliances of his family;
however criminal the deposed monarch might be, this
youth was entirely innocent; he was of the same religion,
and educated in the same manners with the people, and
could not be governed by any separate interest: These
views would all concur to favour his claim; and tho' the
abilities of the present prince might ward off any dan∣gerous
revolution, it was justly to be apprehended, that
his authority could with difficulty be brought to equal
that of his predecessors.</P>
<P>HENRY in his very first parliament had reason to see
the danger attending that station, which he had assumed,
and the obstacles, which he would meet with, in go∣verning
an unruly aristocracy, always divided by faction,
and still more inflamed with the resentments, consequent
on such recent convulsions. The peers on their as∣sembling
<PB N="68" REF="76"/>
broke out into violent animosities; forty gaunt∣lets,
the gages of furious battle, were thrown on the
floor of the house of lords by noblemen who gave mutual
challenges to each other; and <HI>liar</HI> and <HI>traitor</HI> resounded
from all quarters. The King had so much authority
with these doughty champions, as to prevent all the com∣bats,
which they threatened; but he was not able to
bring them to a proper composure, or to an amicable
disposition towards each other.</P>
<P>IT was not long before these passions broke out in
action.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1400.</NOTE> The earls of Rutland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An insur∣rection.</NOTE> Kent, and Huntington
and lord Spencer, who were now degraded from the titles
of Albemarle, Surry, Exeter, and Glocester, conferred
on them by Richard, entered into a conspiracy, together
with the earl of Salisbury and lord Lumley, for raising
an insurrection, and for seizing the King's person at
Windsor<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 362. Otterbourne, p. 224.</NOTE>; but the treachery of Rutland gave him
warning of the danger. He suddenly withdrew to Lon∣don;
and the conspirators, who came to Windsor with
a body of 500 horse, found that they had missed this blow,
on which all the success of their enterprize depended.
Henry appeared, next day, at Kingston upon Thames,
at the head of 20,000 men, mostly drawn from the city;
and his enemies, unable to resist his power, dispersed
themselves, with a view of raising their followers in the
several counties, which were the seat of their interest.
But the adherents of the King were hot in the pursuit,
and every where opposed themselves to their progress.
The earls of Kent and Salisbury were seized at Ciren∣cester
by the citizens; and were next day beheaded with∣out
farther ceremony, according to the custom of the
times<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 363. Ypod. Neust. p. 556.</NOTE>. The citizens of Bristol treated Spencer and
<PB N="69" REF="77"/>
Lumley in the same manner. The earl of Huntington,
Sir Thomas Blount, Sir Benedict Sely, who were also
taken prisoners, suffered death, with many others of the
conspirators, by orders from Henry. And when the
quarters of these unhappy men were brought to London,
no less than eighteen bishops and thirty-four mitred
abbots, joined the populace, and met them with the
most indecent marks of joy and exultation.</P>
<P>BUT the spectacle the most shocking to every one,
who retained any sentiment either of honour or humanity,
still remained. The earl of Rutland appeared, carrying
on a pole the head of lord Spencer, his brother-in-law,
which he presented in triumph to Henry, as a testimony
of his loyalty. This infamous man, who was soon after
duke of York by the death of his father, and first prince
of the blood, had been instrumental in the murder of his
uncle, the duke of Glocester<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, vol. ii. p. 171.</NOTE>; had then deserted
Richard, by whom he was trusted; had conspired against
the life of Henry, to whom he had sworn allegiance; had
betrayed his associates, whom he had seduced into this
enterprize; and now displayed, in the face of the world,
these badges of his multiplied dishonour.</P>
<P>HENRY was sensible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1401.</NOTE> that, tho' the execution of these
conspirators might seem to give security to his throne,
the animosities, which remain after such bloody scenes,
are always dangerous to royal authority; and he there∣fore
determined not to encrease, by any hazardous enter∣prize,
those numerous enemies, with whom he was every
where surrounded. While he was only a subject, he was
believed to have strongly imbibed all the principles of his
father, the duke of Lancaster, and to have adopted the
prejudices which the Lollards inspired against the abuses
of the established church: But finding himself possessed
<PB N="70" REF="78"/>
of the throne by so precarious a title, he thought super∣stition
a very necessary implement of public authority;
and he resolved, by every expedient, to pay court to the
clergy. There were hitherto no penal laws enacted
against heresy; an indulgence which had nowise pro∣ceeded
from a spirit of toleration in the Romish church,
but from the ignorance and simplicity of the people, which had
rendered them unfit either for starting or re∣ceiving
any new or curious doctrines, and which needed
not to be restrained by any rigorous punishments. But
when the learning and genius of Wickliffe had once
broke the fetters of prejudice, the ecclesiastics called
aloud for the punishment of his disciples; and the King,
who was very little scrupulous in his conduct, was easily
induced to sacrifice his principles to his interest, and to
acquire the favour of the church by that most effectual
method, the gratifying their vengeance against all oppo∣nents.
He engaged the parliament to pass a law for
this purpose, and it was enacted, that when any heretic,
who relapsed or refused co abjure his opinions, was deli∣vered
over to the secular arm by the bishop or his com∣missaries,
he should be committed to the flames by the
civil magistrate before the whole people<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">2 Henry IV. chap. vii.</NOTE>. This wea∣pon
did not remain long unemployed in the hands of the
clergy: William Sautre, rector of St. Osithes in London,
had been condemned by the convocation of Canterbury;
his sentence was ratified by the house of peers; the King
issued his writ for the execution<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. viii. p. 178.</NOTE>; and the unhappy
man attoned for his erroneous opinions by the penalty
of fire. This is the first instance of that kind in Eng∣land;
and thus one horror more was added to those dis∣mal
scenes, which at that time were already but too
familiar to the people.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="79"/>
BUT the utmost precaution and prudence of Henry
could not shield him from those numerous inquietudes,
which assailed him from every quarter. The connexions
of Richard with the royal family of France, made that
court exert its activity to recover his authority, or revenge
his death<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. viii. p. 123.</NOTE>; but tho' the confusions of England, tempted
the French to undertake some enterprize, by which they
might distress their ancient enemy, the greater confusions,
which they experienced at home, obliged them quickly
to accommodate matters; and Charles, content with re∣covering
his daughter from Henry's hands, laid aside his
preparations, and renewed the truce between the two
kingdoms<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. viii, p. 142, 152. 219.</NOTE>. The attack of Guienne was also an inviting
attempt, which the present factions, that prevailed among
the French, obliged them to neglect. The Gascons,
affectionate to the memory of Richard, who had been
born among them, refused to swear allegiance to a prince
that had usurped his throne, and murdered his person;
and the appearance of a French army on their frontiers,
would probably have tempted them to change masters<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. viii. p. 110, 111.</NOTE>.
But the earl of Worcester, arriving with some English
troops, gave countenance to the partizans of England,
and overawed their opponents. Religion too was here
found a cement of their union with that kingdom.
The Gascons had been engaged by Richard's authority to ac∣knowledge
the Pope of Rome; and they were sen∣sible,
that if they submitted to France, it would be
necessary for them to pay obedience to the Pope of
Avignon, whom they had been taught to detest as a
schismatic. Their principles on this head were too fast
rooted to admit of any sudden or violent alteration.</P>
<P>THE revolution in England proved likewise the occa∣sion
of an insurrection in Wales.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrection in Wales.</NOTE> Owen Glendour, or
<PB N="72" REF="80"/>
Glendourduy, descended from the ancient princes of
that country, had become obnoxious on account of his
attachments to Richard; and Reginald, lord Gray of
Ruthyn, who was closely connected with the new King,
and who possessed a great fortune in the marches of
Wales, thought the opportunity favourable for oppres∣sing
his neighbour, and taking possession of his estate<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Vita Ric. sec. p. 171, 172.</NOTE>.
Glendour, provoked at the injustice, and still more at
the indignity, recovered possession by the sword<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 364.</NOTE>: Henry
sent assistance to Gray<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Vita Ric. sec. 172, 173.</NOTE>; the Welsh took party with
Glendour: A troublesome and tedious war was kindled,
which Glendour long sustained by his valour and acti∣vity,
aided by the natural strength of that country, and
the untamed spirit of its inhabitants.</P>
<P>As Glendour committed devastations promiscuously on
all the English, he infested the estate of the earl of
Marche; and Sir Edmund Mortimer, uncle to that
nobleman, led out the retainers of the family, and gave
battle to the Welsh chieftain. His troops were routed,
and he himself was taken prisoner<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, vol, i. p. 150.</NOTE>: At the same time,
the earl himself, who had been allowed to retire to his
castle of Wigmore, and who, tho' a mere boy, took the
field with his followers, fell also into Glendour's hands,
and was carried by him into Wales<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. i. p. 151.</NOTE>. As Henry hated
mortally all the family of Marche, he allowed the earl
to remain in captivity; and tho' that young nobleman
was nearly allied to the Piercies, to whose assistance he
himself had owed his crown, he refused to the earl of
Northumberland permission to treat of his ransom with
Glendour.</P>
<P>THE uncertainty in which Henry's affairs stood for
a long time with France, as well as the confusion, in∣cident
<PB N="73" REF="81"/>
to all great changes in government, tempted the
Scots to make incursions into England; and Henry, de∣sirous
of taking revenge upon them, but afraid of ren∣dering
his new government unpopular by requiring great
supplies from his subjects, summoned at Westminster a
council of the peers, without the commons, and laid
before them the state of his affairs<NOTE N="j" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. viii. p. 125, 126.</NOTE>. The military part
of the feudal constitution was now entirely gone: There
remained only so much of that fabric as affected the civil
rights and properties of men: And the peers here under∣took,
but voluntarily, to attend the King in an expe∣dition
against Scotland, each of them at the head of a
certain number of his retainers<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. viii. p. 125.</NOTE>.
Henry conducted this
army to Edinburgh, of which he easily took possession;
and he there summoned Robert III. to do homage to
him for his crown<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. viii. p. 155, 156, &amp;c.</NOTE>. But finding, that the Scots would
neither submit nor give him battle, he returned in three
weeks, after making this useless bravade; and he dis∣persed
his army.</P>
<P>IN the subsequent season,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1402.</NOTE> Archibald earl of Douglas,
at the head of 12,000 men, and attended by many of
the principal nobility of Scotland, made an irruption into
England, and committed devastations on the northern
counties. On his return home, he was overtaken by the
Piercies, at Homeldon on the borders of England,
and a fierce battle ensued, where the Scots were totally
routed. Douglas himself was taken prisoner; as was
Mordac earl of Fife, son of the duke of Albany, and ne∣phew
of the Scots King, with the earls of Angus,
Murray, and Orkney, and many others of the Scots
gentry and nobility<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 366. Vita Ric. sec. p. 180. Chron. Otterbourne, p. 237.</NOTE>. When Henry received intel∣ligence
<PB N="74" REF="82"/>
of this victory, he sent the earl of Northum∣berland
orders not to ransom his prisoners, which that
nobleman regarded as his right, by the laws of war,
that prevailed in that age. The King intended to de∣tain
them, that he might be able by their means to make
an advantageous peace with Scotland; but by this policy
he gave a new cause of disgust to the family of Piercy.</P>
<P>THE obligations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1403.</NOTE> which Henry had owed to the earl
of Northumberland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The earl of Northum∣berland re∣bels.</NOTE> were of a kind the most likely to
produce ingratitude on the one side, and discontent on
the other. The prince naturally became jealous of that
power, which had advanced him to the throne; and the
subject was not easily satisfied in the returns, which he
thought so great a favour had merited. Tho' Henry, on
his accession, had bestowed the office of constable on
Northumberland for life<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. viii. p. 89.</NOTE>, and conferred other gifts on
that family, these favours were regarded as their due;
the refusal of any other request was deemed an injury.
The impatient spirit of Harry Piercy, and the factious
disposition of the earl of Worcester, younger brother of
Northumberland, inflamed the discontents of that noble∣man;
and the precarious title of Henry tempted him to
seek revenge, by overturning that throne, which he had
at first established. He entered into a correspondence
with Glendour: He gave liberty to the earl of Dou∣glas,
and made an alliance with that martial chieftain:
He rouzed up all his partizans to arms; and such unli∣mited
authority at that time belonged to the great fami∣lies,
that the same men, whom, a few years before, he
had conducted against Richard, now followed his stan∣dard
in opposition to Henry. When the war was ready
to break out, Northumberland was seized with a sudden
illness at Berwic; and young Piercy taking the command
<PB N="75" REF="83"/>
of the troops, marched towards Shrewsbury, in order to
join his forces with those of Glendour. The King had
happily a small army on foot, with which he had in∣tended
to act against the Scots; and knowing the im∣portance
of celerity in all civil wars, he instantly hur∣ried
down, that he might give battle to the rebels. He
approached Piercy near Shrewsbury, before that noble∣man
was joined by Glendour; and the policy of the one
leader, and impatience of the other, made them both
hasten to a general engagement.</P>
<P>THE evening before the battle, Piercy sent a mani∣festo
to Henry, in which he renounced his allegiance,
set that prince at defiance, and in the name of his father
and uncle, as well as his own, enumerated all the griev∣ances
of which the nation had reason to complain. He
represented the perjury, of which Henry had been guilty,
when, on landing at Ravenspur, he had sworn upon the
gospels, before the earl of Northumberland, that he
had no other intention but to recover possession of the
dutchy of Lancaster, and that he would ever remain a
faithful subject to King Richard. He aggravated his
guilt in first dethroning and then murdering that prince,
and in usurping on the title of the house of Mortimer,
to whom, both by lineal succession, and by declarations of
parliament, the throne, when vacant by Richard's death,
did of right belong. He complained of the cruel policy,
in allowing the young earl of Marche, whom he ought
to regard as his sovereign, to remain a captive in the
hands of his enemies, and in even refusing to all his
friends permission to treat of his ransom. He charged him
again with perjury in loading the nation with heavy taxes,
after having sworn that, without the utmost necessity, he
would never levy any impositions upon them. And he
reproached him with the arts employed in procuring fa∣vourable
elections into parliament; arts, which he him∣self
<PB N="76" REF="84"/>
had before imputed to Richard, and which he had
made one chief reason of that prince's arraignment and de∣position<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 21, 22, &amp;c.</NOTE>.
This manifesto was very well calculated to in∣flame
the quarrel between the parties: The bravery of the
two leaders, promised an obstinate engagement: And the
equality of the armies, being each about 12,000 men, a
number which rendered them not unmanageable by the
commanders, gave reason to expect a great effusion of
blood on both sides, and a very doubtful issue to the
combat.</P>
<P>WE shall scarcely find any battle in those ages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21st July. Battle of Shrewsbury.</NOTE> where
the shock was more terrible and more constant. Henry
exposed his person in the thickest of the fight: His gal∣lant
son, whose military feats became afterwards so fa∣mous,
and who here performed his apprenticeship in arms,
signalized himself on his father's footsteps, and even a
wound, which he received on the face with an arrow,
could not oblige him to quit the field<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">T. Livii, p. 3.</NOTE>. Piercy supported
that renown, which he had acquired in so many bloody
combats. And Douglas, his antient enemy and now his
friend, still appeared his rival, amidst the horror and con∣fusion
of the day. This nobleman performed feats of va∣lour,
which are almost incredible: He seemed determined
that the King of England should fall that day by his arm:
He sought him all over the field of battle: And as Henry,
either to elude the attacks of the enemy upon his person,
or to encourage his own men by the belief of his pre∣sence
every where, had accoutered several captains in the
royal garb, the sword of Douglas rendered this honour
fatal to many<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 366, 367. Hall, fol. 22,</NOTE>. But while the armies were contending
in this furious manner, the death of Piercy, by an un∣certain
hand, decided the victory, and the royalists pre∣vailed.
There are said to have fallen that day on both
<PB N="77" REF="85"/>
sides near two thousand three hundred gentlemen; but
the persons of greatest distinction were on the King's;
the earl of Stafford, Sir Hugh Shirley, Sir Nicholas
Gausel, Sir Hugh Mortimer, Sir John Massey, Sir John
Calverley. About six thousand private men perished, of
whom two thirds were of Piercy's army<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Chron. Otterbourne, p. 224. Ypod Neust p. 560.</NOTE>. The earls
of Worcester and Douglas were taken prisoners; The
former was beheaded at Shrewsbury; the latter was treat∣ed
with the courtesy, which was due to his rank and
merit.</P>
<P>THE earl of Northumberland, having recovered his
health, had levyed an army, and was on his march to
join his son; but being opposed by the earl of Westmore∣land,
and hearing of the event of the battle at Shrews∣bury,
he dismissed his forces, and came with a small re∣tinue
to the King at York<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Chron. Otterbourne, p. 225.</NOTE>. He pretended, that his
sole intention in arming was to mediate between the two
parties: Henry thought proper to accept the apology,
and even granted him a pardon for his offence: All the
other rebels were treated with equal lenity; and except
the earl of Worcester and Sir Richard Vernon, who
were regarded as the chief authors of the insurrection, no
person, engaged in this dangerous design, seems to have
perished by the hands of the executioner<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. viii, p. 353.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT Northumberland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1405.</NOTE> tho' he had been pardoned,
knew, that he never should be trusted, and that he was
too powerful to be cordially forgiven by a prince, whose
situation gave him such reasonable grounds of jealousy.
It was the effect either of Henry's vigilance or good for∣tune,
or of the narrow genius of his enemies, that no
proper concert was ever formed among them. They rose
in rebellion one after another; and thereby afforded him
<PB N="78" REF="86"/>
an opportunity of suppressing singly those insurrections,
which, had they been united, might have proved fatal
to his authority. The earl of Nottingham, son to the
duke of Norfolk, and the archbishop of York, brother to
the earl of Wiltshire, whom Henry, then duke of Lan∣caster,
had beheaded at Bristol, tho' they had remained
quiet, while Piercy was in the field, still harboured in
their breast a violent hatred against the enemy of their fa∣milies;
and they determined, in conjunction with the
earl of Northumberland, to seek revenge against him.
They betook themselves to arms before that powerful
nobleman was prepared to join them; and publishing a
manifesto, in which they reproached Henry with his usur∣pation
of the crown and the murder of the late King,
they required, that the right line should be restored, and
all public grievances be redressed. The earl of West∣moreland,
whose power lay in the neighbourhood, ap∣proached
them with an inferior force at Shipton near
York; and being afraid to hazard a battle, he attempted
to subdue them by a stratagem, which nothing but the
greatest folly and simplicity on their part could have ren∣dered
successful. He desired a conference with the arch∣bishop
and earl between the two armies: He heard their
grievances with great patience; He begged them to pro∣pose
the remedies: He approved of every thing which
they suggested: He granted them all their demands: He
also engaged that Henry should give them entire satisfac∣tion:
And when he saw them pleased with the facility of
his concessions, he observed to them, that, since amity
was now in effect restored between them, it were better
on both sides to dismiss their forces, which otherwise
would prove an insupportable burthen to the country.
The archbishop and the earl of Nottingham immediately
issued orders to that purpose: Their troops disbanded
upon the field: But Westmoreland, who had secretly
<PB N="79" REF="87"/>
issued contrary orders to <HI>his</HI> army, seized the two rebels
without resistance, and carried them to the King, who
was advancing with hasty marches to suppress the rebel∣lion<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 373. Otterbourne, p. 255.</NOTE>.
The trial and punishment of an archbishop
might have proved a very troublesome and dangerous un∣dertaking,
had Henry proceeded regularly, and allowed
time for an opposition to form itself against that unusual
measure. The celerity of the execution alone could here
render it safe and prudent. Finding that Sir William
Gascoigne, the chief justice, made some scruple of acting
on this occasion, he appointed Sir William Fulthorpe a
judge for that purpose; who, without any indictment,
trial or defence, pronounced sentence of death upon the
prelate, which was instantly executed. This was the
first instance in England of a capital punishment inflicted
on a bishop; whence the clergy of that rank might learn,
that their crimes, as well as those of laics, were not to
pass with impunity. The earl of Nottingham was con∣demned
and executed in the same summary manner: But
tho' many other persons of condition, such as the lord
Falconberge, Sir Ralph Hastings, Sir John Colville,
were engaged in this rebellion, no more seem to have
fallen victims to Henry's severity.</P>
<P>THE earl of Northumberland, on receiving this intel∣ligence,
fled into Scotland, together with lord Bardolf<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 374.</NOTE>;
and the King, without opposition, reduced all the
castles and fortresses, belonging to these noblemen. He
thence turned his arms against Glendour, over whom his
son, the prince of Wales, had obtained some advantages:
But that enemy, more troublesome than dangerous, still
found means of defending himself in his fastnesses, and
of eluding, tho' not resisting, all the force of England.
In a subsequent season,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1407.</NOTE> the earl of Northumberland and
<PB N="80" REF="88"/>
lord Bardolf, impatient of their exile, entered the north,
in hopes of raising the people to arms; but found the
country in such a posture as rendered all their attempts
unsuccessful. Sir Thomas Rokesby, sheriff of York∣shire,
levied some forces, attacked the invaders at Bram∣ham,
and gained a victory, in which both Northumber∣land
and Bardolf were slain<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 377. Chron. Otterb. p. 261.</NOTE>. This prosperous event,
joined to the death of Glendour, which happened soon
after, freed Henry from all his domestic enemies; and
this prince, who had mounted the throne by such unjus∣tifiable
methods, and held it by such an exceptionable
title, had yet, by his valour, prudence, and address, ac∣customed
his people to the yoke, and had obtained a
greater ascendant over his haughty barons, than the law
alone, not supported by these active qualities, was ever
able to confer.</P>
<P>ABOUT the same time, fortune gave Henry an advan∣tage
over that neighbour, who, by his situation, was best
enabled to disturb his government. Robert the Third,
King of Scots, was a prince, tho' of slender capacity,
extremely innocent and inoffensive in his conduct: But
Scotland, at that time, was still less fitted than England
for cherishing, or even enduring, sovereigns of that cha∣racter.
The duke of Albany, Robert's brother, a prince
of more abilities, at least of a more boisterous and violent
disposition, had assumed the government of the state; and
not satisfied with present authority, he entertained the
criminal purpose of extirpating his brother's children,
and of acquiring the crown to his own family. He threw
in prison David, his eldest nephew; who there perished
with hunger: James alone, the younger brother of Da∣vid,
stood between that tyrant and the throne; and King
Robert, sensible of his son's danger, embarked him on
<PB N="81" REF="89"/>
board a ship, with a view of sending him into France,
and entrusting him to the protection of that friendly
power. Unfortunately, the vessel was taken by the Eng∣lish;
prince James, a boy about nine years of age, was
carried to London; and tho' there subsisted a truce at
that time between the two kingdoms, Henry constantly
refused to restore the young prince to his liberty. Robert,
worn out with cares and infirmities, was unable to bear
the shock of this last misfortune; and he soon after died,
leaving the government in the hands of the duke of Al∣bany<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 10.</NOTE>. Henry was now more sensible than ever of the
importance of the acquisition, which he had made:
While he retained such a pledge in his hands, he was
sure of keeping the duke of Albany in dependance; or
if offended, he could easily, by restoring the true heir,
take ample revenge upon the usurper. But tho' the
King, by detaining James in the English court, had
shown himself somewhat deficient in generosity, he made
ample amends by giving that prince an excellent education,
which afterwards qualified him, when he mounted the
throne, to reform, in some measure, the rude and bar∣barous
manners of his native country.</P>
<P>THE hostile dispositions, which always prevailed be∣tween
France and England, were restrained, during the
greatest part of this reign, from appearing in action.
The jealousies and civil commotions, with which both
nations were disturbed, kept each of them from taking
advantage of the unhappy situation of its neighbour. But
as the abilities and good fortune of Henry had been able
sooner to compose the English factions, this prince be∣gan,
in the latter part of his reign, to look abroad, and
to foment the animosities between the families of Bur∣gundy
and Orleans, by which the government of France
<PB N="82" REF="90"/>
was, during that period, so much distracted. He knew,
that one great source of the national discontent against
his predecessor, was the inactivity of his reign; and he
hoped, by giving a new direction to the restless and un∣quiet
spirits of his people, to prevent their breaking out
in dome stic wars and disorders.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1411.</NOTE> That he might join
policy to force, he first entered into treaty with the duke
of Burgundy, and sent that prince a small body of troops,
which supported him against his enemies<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 380.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1412.</NOTE> Soon after,
he hearkened to more advantageous proposals made him
by the duke of Orleans, and dispatched a greater body
to support that party<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. viii. p. 715. 738.</NOTE>. But the leaders of the opposite
factions having made a temporary accommodation of their
differences, the interests of the English were sacrificed;
and this effort of Henry proved, in the issue, entirely
vain and fruitless. The declining state of his health and
the shortness of his reign, prevented him from renewing
the attempt, which his more fortunate son carried to so
great a length against the French monarchy.</P>
<P>SUCH were the military and foreign transactions of
this reign:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliamen∣tary trans∣actions.</NOTE> The civil and parliamentary are somewhat
more memorable; and more worthy of our attention.
During the two last reigns, the elections of the com∣mons
had appeared a circumstance of government not to
be neglected; and Richard was even accused of using
unwarrantable methods for procuring to his partizans a
seat in that house. This practice formed one consider∣able
article of charge against him in his deposition; yet
Henry scrupled not to tread in his footsteps, and to en∣courage
the same abuses in elections. Laws were en∣acted
against such undue influence, and even a sheriff
was punished for an iniquitous return, which he had
made<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 429.</NOTE>: But laws commonly were, at that time, very
<PB N="83" REF="91"/>
ill executed; and the liberties of the people, such as they
were, stood on a surer basis than on laws and parliamen∣tary
elections. Tho' the house of commons was little
able to withstand the violent currents, which perpetually
ran between the monarchy and the aristocracy, and that
house might easily be brought, at a particular time, to
make the most unwarrantable concessions to either; the
general institutions of the state still remained invariable;
the interests of the several members continued on the
same footing; the sword was in the hands of the sub∣ject;
and the government, tho' thrown into temporary
disorders, soon settled itself on its antient foundations.</P>
<P>DURING the greatest part of this reign, the King
was obliged to court popularity; and the house of com∣mons,
sensible of their own importance, began to assume
powers, which had not usually been exercised by their
predecessors. In the first session of this reign, they pro∣cured
a law, that no judge, in concurring with any ini∣quitous
measure, should be excused by pleading the or∣ders
of the King, or even the danger of his own life
from the menaces of the sovereign<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 364.</NOTE>. In the second year of Henry, they insisted on maintaining the practice of not granting any supply before they received an an∣swer
to their petitions; which was a tacit method of
bargaining with the prince<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 406.</NOTE>. In the fifth year, they
desired the King to remove from his household four of∣ficers
who had displeased them, among whom was his
own confessor; and Henry, though he told them, that
he knew of no offence, which these persons had com∣mitted,
yet, in order to gratify them, complied with their
request<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 426.</NOTE>. In the sixth year, they voted the King sup∣plies,
but appointed treasurers of their own, to see the
money disbursed for the purposes intended, and required
<PB N="84" REF="92"/>
them to deliver in their accounts to the house<NOTE N="j" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 438.</NOTE>. In the
eighth year, they proposed thirty very important articles
for the regulation of the government and household,
which were all granted them; and they even obliged all
the members of council, all the judges, and all the offi∣cers
of the household, to swear to the observance of
them<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 456. 457.</NOTE>. The abridger of the records observes the un∣usual
liberties taken by the speaker and the house during
this period<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 462.</NOTE>. But the great authority of the commons
was but a temporary advantage arising from the present
situation. In a subsequent parliament, when the speaker
made his customary applications to the throne for liberty
of speech, the King, having now overcome all his do∣mestic
difficulties, plainly told him, that he would have
no novelties introduced, and would enjoy his prerogatives.
But on the whole, the limitations of the government
seem to have been more sensibly felt, and more carefully
maintained by Henry than by any of his predecessors.</P>
<P>DURING this reign, when the house of commons were,
at any time, brought to make unwary concessions to
the crown, they also showed their freedom by a very
speedy retractation of them. Henry, tho' he entertained a
perpetual and well-grounded jealousy of the family of
Mortimer, allowed not their name to be once mentioned
in parliament; and as none of the rebels had ventured
to declare the earl of Marche king, he never attempt∣ed
to procure, what would not have been refused him,
an express declaration against the claim of that noble∣man;
because he knew that such a declaration, in the
present circumstances, would have no authority, and
would only serve to revive the memory of Mortimer's
title in the minds of the people. He proceeded in his
purpose after a more artful and covert manner. He pro∣cured
<PB N="85" REF="93"/>
a settlement of the crown on himself and his heirs∣male<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 454.</NOTE>,
thereby tacitly excluding the females, and trans∣ferring
the Salic law to the English government. He
thought, that, tho' the house of Plantagenet had at first
derived their title from females, this was a remote event,
unknown to the generality of the people; and if he could
once accustom the nation to the practice of excluding
women, the title of the earl of Marche would gradually
be forgot and neglected by them. But he was very un∣fortunate
in this attempt. During the long contests with
France, the injustice of the Salic law had been so much
exclaimed against by the nation, that a contrary prin∣ciple
had taken deep root in the minds of men, and it
was now become impossible to eradicate it. The same
house of commons, therefore, in a subsequent session,
apprehensive that they had overturned the foundations
of the English government, and that they had opened
the door to move civil wars than might ensue even from
the irregular advancement of the house of Lancaster,
applied with such earnestness for a new settlement of the
crown, that Henry yielded to their request, and agreed
to the succession of the princesses of his family<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. viii. p. 462.</NOTE>. A cer∣tain
proof, that no-body was, in his heart, satisfied with
the King's title to the crown, or knew on what principle to
rest it.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the commons, during this reign, showed a
very laudable zeal for liberty in their transactions with
the crown; their efforts against the church were still
more extraordinary, and seemed to anticipate very much
on the spirit which became so general in little more than
a century afterwards. I know, that the credit of these
passages rests entirely on one antient historian<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Walsingham.</NOTE>; but

<PB N="86" REF="96"/>
that historian was contemporary, was a churchman, and
it was contrary to the interests of his order to preserve
the memory of such transactions, much more to forge
precedents, which posterity might, some time, be tempt∣ed
to imitate. This is a truth so evident, that the most
likely way of accounting for the silence of the records on
this head, is by supposing, that the authority of some
churchmen was so great as to procure a razure, with re∣gard
to these circumstances, which the indiscretion of
one of that order has happily preserved to us.</P>
<P>IN the sixth of Henry, the commons, who had been
required to grant supplies, proposed in plain terms to the
King, that he should seize all the temporalities of the
church, and employ them as a perpetual fund to serve
the exigences of the state. They insisted, that the
clergy possessed a third of the lands of the kingdom;
that they contributed nothing to the support of the
public burdens; and that their exorbitant riches tended
only to disqualify them for performing their ministerial
functions with proper zeal and attention. When this
address was presented, the archbishop of Canterbury,
who then attended the King, objected, that the clergy,
tho' they went not in person to the wars, sent their vas∣sals
and tenants in all cases of necessity; while at the
same time, they themselves, who staid at home, were
employed, night and day, in offering up their prayers
for the happiness and prosperity of the state. The speaker
smiled, and replied without reserve, that he thought the
prayers of the church but a very slender supply. The
archbishop, however, prevailed in the dispute: The
King discouraged the application of the commons: And
the lords rejected the bill which the lower house had
framed for despoiling the church of her revenues<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 371. Ypod Neust. p. 563.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="97"/>
THE commons were not discouraged by this repulse:
In the eleventh of the King they returned to the charge
with more zeal than before: They made a calculation
of all the ecclesiastical revenues, which, by their account,
amounted to 485,000 marks a year, and included 18,400
ploughs of land. They proposed to divide this riches
among fifteen new earls, 1500 knights, 6000 esquires,
and a hundred hospitals; besides 20,000 pounds a year
which the King might take for his own use: And they
insisted, that the clerical functions would be better per∣formed
than at present, by 15,000 parish priests, at the
rate of seven marks apiece of yearly stipend<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 379. Tit. Livius.</NOTE>. This
application was accompanied with an address for mitiga∣ting
the statutes enacted against the Lollards, which
shows from what source the address came. The King
gave the commons a severe reply, and farther to satisfy
the church, and to prove that he was quite in earnest,
he ordered a Lollard to be burned before the dissolution of
the parliament<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. viii. p. 627. Otterbourne, p. 267.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WE have now related almost all the memorable trans∣actions
of this reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1413.</NOTE> which was busy and active; but
produced few events, that deserve to be transmitted to
posterity. The King was so much employed in de∣sending
his crown, which he had obtained by such un∣warrantable
means, and possessed by so bad a title, that
he had little leisure to look abroad, or perform any acti∣ons,
which might redound to the honour or advantage of
the nation. His health declined visibly some months be∣fore
his death: He was subject to fits, which bereaved
him, for the time, of his senses: And tho' he was yet
in the flower of his age, his end was visibly approaching.
<PB N="88" REF="98"/>
HE expired at Westminster in the forty-sixth year of his
age, and the thirteenth of his reign.</P>
<P>THE great popularity, which Henry enjoyed before he
attained the crown,<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th March Death and character of the King.</NOTE> and which had so much aided him in
the acquisition of it, was entirely lost many years before
the end of his reign; and he governed his people more
by terror than by affection, more by his own policy than
by their sense of duty or allegiance. When men came
to reflect in cold blood on the crimes which had led him
to the throne; the rebellion against his prince; the depo∣sition
of a lawful King guilty sometimes perhaps of oppres∣sion,
but more frequently of imprudences; the exclusion of
the true heir; the murder of his sovereign and near re∣lation;
these were such enormities as drew on him the
hatred of his subjects, sanctified all the rebellions against
him, and made the executions, tho' not remarkably se∣vere,
which he found necessary for the maintenance of his
authority, appear cruel as well as iniquitous to the people.
Yet without pretending to apologize for these crimes,
which must ever be held in detestation, it may be re∣marked,
that he was insensibly led into this blameable
conduct by a train of incidents, which few men possess
virtue enough to withstand. The injustice with which
his predecessor had treated him, in first condemning him
to banishment, and then despoiling him of his patrimony,
made him naturally think of revenge, and of recovering
his lost rights; the headlong zeal of the people hurried
him into the throne; the care of his own security, as
well as his ambition, made him an usurper; and the
steps have always been so few between the prisons of
princes and their graves, that we need not wonder if
Richard's fate was no exception to the general rule. All
these considerations make Henry's situation, if he retained
any sense of virtue, very much to be lamented; and the
inquietude with which he possessed his envied greatness,
<PB N="89" REF="99"/>
and the remorses, by which it is said he was continually
haunted, render him an object of our pity, even when
seated upon the throne. But it must be owned, that his
prudence and vigilance and foresight, in maintaining his
power, were admirable: His command of temper re∣markable:
His courage, both military and political,
without blemish: And he possessed many qualities, which
fitted him for his high station, and which rendered his
usurpation of it, tho' pernicious in after times, rather
salutary, during his own reign, to the English nation.</P>
<P>HENRY was twice married: By his first wife, Mary
de Bohun, daughter and co-heir of the earl of Hereford,
he had four sons, Henry, his successor in the throne,
Thomas duke of Clarence, John duke of Bedford, and
Humphrey duke of Glocester; and two daughters,
Blanche and Philippa, the former married to the duke
of Bavaria, the latter to the King of Denmark. His
second wife, Jane, whom he married after he was King,
and who was daughter to the King of Navarre, and wi∣dow
of the duke of Brittany, brought him no issue.</P>

<P>THE many jealousies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XIX.</NOTE> to which Henry IV's situa∣tion
naturally exposed him, had so infected his
temper, that he had been persuaded to entertain unrea∣sonable
suspicio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s with regard to the fidelity of his eldest
son;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's former dis∣orders.</NOTE> and during the latter years of his life, he had ex∣cluded
that prince from all share in public business, and
was even displeased to see him at the head of armies,
where his martial talents, tho' useful to the support of
government, acquired him a renown, which, he thought,
might prove dangerous to his own authority. The active
spirit of young Henry, restrained from its proper exer∣cise,
broke out in extravagancies of every kind; and the
riot of pleasure, the frolics of debauchery, the outrage
of wine, filled the vacancies of a mind, better adapted to
the pursuits of ambition, and the cares of government.
This course of life threw him among companions, whose
disorders, if accompanied with spirit and humour, he se∣conded
and indulged; and he was detected in many sal∣lies,
which, to severer eyes, appeared totally unworthy
<PB N="91" REF="101"/>
of his rank and station. There even remains a tradi∣tion,
that, when heated with liquor and jollity, he scru∣pled
not to accompany them in attacking the passengers
on the streets and high-ways, and despoiling them of
their goods; and he found an amusement in the inci∣dents,
which the terror and regret of these defenceless
people produced on such occasions. This extreme of dis∣soluteness
proved equally disagreeable to his father, as
that eager application to business, which had at first
given him occasion of jealousy; and he saw in his son's
behaviour the same neglect of decency, the same attach∣ment
to low company, which had destroyed the personal
character of Richard, and which, more than all his errors
in government, had tended to overturn his throne. But
the nation in general considered the young prince with
more indulgence; and observed so many gleams of ge∣nerosity,
spirit, and magnanimity, breaking continually
thro' the cloud, which a wild conduct threw over his
character, that they never ceased hoping for his amend∣ment,
and ascribed all the weeds, which shot up in that
rich soil, to the want of proper culture and attention in
the King and his ministers. There passed an event which
encouraged these agreeable views, and gave much occa∣sion
for favourable reflexions to all men of sense and
candour. A riotous companion of the prince's had been
indicted before Gascoigne, the chief justice, for some
disorders; and Henry was not ashamed to appear at the
bar with the criminal, in order to give him countenance
and protection. Finding, that his presence had not over∣awed
the chief justice, he proceeded to insult that ma∣gistrate
on his tribunal; but Gascoigne, mindful of the
character which he then bore, and the majesty of the
sovereign and of the laws, which he sustained, ordered
the prince to be carried to prison for his rude behaviour<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 33.</NOTE>.
<PB N="92" REF="102"/>
The spectators were agreeably disappointed, when they
saw the heir of the crown submit peaceably to this sen∣tence,
make reparation for his error by acknowledging it,
and check his impetuous nature in the midst of its extra∣vagant
career.</P>
<P>THE memory of this incident, and of many others of
a like nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His re∣formation.</NOTE> rendered the prospect of the future reign
no wise disagreeable to the nation, and encreased the joy,
which the death of so unpopular a prince as his father,
naturally occasioned. The first steps taken by the young
King confirmed all those prepoffessions, entertained in
his favour<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 382.</NOTE>. He called together his former companions,
acquainted them with his intended reformation, exhorted
them to imitate his example, but strictly inhibited
them, till they had given proofs of their sincerity in
this particular, to appear any more in his presence;
and he thus dismissed them with liberal presents<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 33. Hollingshed, p. 543. Goodwin's Life of Henry V. p. I.</NOTE>. The
wise ministers of his father, who had checked his riots,
found that they had unknowingly been paying the highest
court to him; and were received with all the marks of
favour and confidence. The chief justice himself, who
trembled to approach the royal presence, met with prai∣ses,
instead of reproaches, for his past conduct, and was
exhorted to persevere in the same rigorous and impartial
execution of the laws. The surprize of those, who ex∣pected
an opposite behaviour, augmented their satisfaction;
and the character of the young King appeared brighter
than if it had never been shaded by any errors.</P>
<P>BUT Henry was anxious not only to repair his own
misconduct, but also to make amends for those iniqui∣ties,
into which policy or the necessity of affairs had be∣trayed
his father. He expressed the deepest sorrow for
<PB N="93" REF="103"/>
the fate of the unhappy Richard, did justice to the me∣mory
of that unfortunate prince, even performed anew
his funeral obsequies with pomp and solemnity, and che∣rished
all those who had distinguished themselves by
their loyalty and attachment towards him<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hist. Croyland. contin. Hall, fol. 34. Holingshed, p. 544.</NOTE>. Instead of
continuing the restraints which the jealousy of his father
had imposed on the earl of Marche, he received that
young nobleman with singular courtesy and favour; and
by this magnanimity so gained on the gentle and unambi∣tious
nature of his rival, that he remained ever after sin∣cerely
attached to him, and gave him no disturbance in
his future government. The family of Piercy was re∣stored
to its fortune and honours<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Holingshed, p. 545.</NOTE>. The King seemed
ambitious
to bury all party distinctions in oblivion: The
instruments of the preceding reign, who had been ad∣vanced
from their blind zeal for the Lancastrian interest,
more than from their merits, gave place every where to
men of more honourable characters: Virtue seemed now
to have an open career, in which it might exert itself:
The exhortations, as well as example, of the prince
gave it encouragement: All men were unanimous in
their attachment to Henry; and the defects of his title
were forgot, amidst the personal regard, which was uni∣versally
paid to him.</P>
<P>THERE remained among the people only one party
distinction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lol∣lards.</NOTE> derived from religious differences,
and which, as it is of a peculiar and commonly a very
obstinate nature, the popularity of Henry was not able
to overcome. The Lollards were every day encreasing
in the kingdom, and were become a formed party, which
appeared extremely dangerous to the church, and even
formidable to the civil authority<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 382.</NOTE>. The enthusiasm by
<PB N="94" REF="104"/>
which these sectaries were generally actuated, the great
alterations which they pretend to introduce, the hatred
which they expressed against the established hierarchy,
gave an alarm to Henry, who, either from a sincere at∣tachment
to the antient religion, or from the dread of
the unknown consequences, which attend all important
changes, was determined to execute the laws against such
bold innovators. The head of this sect was Sir John
Oldcastle, lord Cobham, a nobleman, who had distin∣guished
himself by his valour and his military talents,
and had, on many occasions, acquired the esteem both of
the late and of the present King<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 382.</NOTE>. His high character
and his zeal for the new sect pointed him out to Arundel,
archbishop of Canterbury, as the proper victim of eccle∣siastical
severity; whose punishment would strike a terror
into the whole party, and teach them that they must ex∣pect
no mercy under the present administration. He ap∣plied
to Henry for a permission to indict lord Cobham<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Fox's Acts and Monuments, p. 513.</NOTE>;
but the generous nature of that prince was averse to such
sanguinary methods of conversion. He represented to
the primate, that reason and conviction were the best
expedients for supporting truth; that every gentle means
ought first to be tried, in order to reclaim men from
error; and that he himself would endeavour, by a con∣versation
with Cobham, to reconcile him to the Catholic
faith. But he found that nobleman obstinate in his opi∣nions,
and determined not to sacrifice truths of such in∣finite
moment to his complaisance for sovereigns<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ix. p. 61. Walsingham, p. 383.</NOTE>. Hen∣ry's
principles of toleration, or rather his love of the
practice, could carry him no farther; and he then gave
full reins to ecclesiastical severity against this inflexible he∣resiarch.
The primate indicted Cobham; and with the
assistance of his three suffragans, the bishops of London,
<PB N="95" REF="105"/>
Winchester, and St. David's, condemned him to the flames
for his erroneous opinions. Cobham, who was confined
to the Tower, made his escape before the day of his exe∣cution.
The bold spirit of this man, provoked by per∣secution
and stimulated by zeal, was urged to attempt the
most criminal enterprizes; and his unlimited authority
over the sect proved, that he well merited the attention
of the civil magistrate. He formed in his retreat very
violent designs against his enemies; and dispatching his
emissaries to all quarters, appointed a general rendezvous
of the party, in order to seize the person of the King at
Eltham,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1414.</NOTE> and put their persecutors to the sword<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 385.</NOTE>. Henry,
apprized of their intention, removed to Westminster:<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 January.</NOTE>
Cobham was not discouraged by this disappointment;
but changed the place of rendezvous to the fields near St.
Giles: The King, having shut the gates of the city, to
prevent any re-inforcement to the Lollards from that
quarter, came into the fields in the night-time, seized
such of the conspirators as appeared, and afterwards laid
hold of the several parties, who were hastening to the
place appointed. It appeared, that few were in the se∣cret
of the conspiracy: The rest implicitly followed
their leaders: But upon the trial of the prisoners, the
treasonable designs of the sect were rendered certain,
both from evidence and from the confession of the crimi∣nals
themselves<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 554. Hall, fol. 35. Holingshed, p. 544.</NOTE>. Some were executed; the greater
number pardoned<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ix. p. 119. 129. 193.</NOTE>. Cobham himself, who made his
escape by flight, was not brought to justice, till four
years after; when he was hanged as a traitor; and his
body was burnt on the gibbet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Punish∣ment of lord Cobham.</NOTE> in execution of the sen∣tence
pronounced against him as a heretic<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 400. Otterbourne, p. 280. Holingshed, p. 561.</NOTE>. This cri∣minal
<PB N="96" REF="106"/>
design, which was perhaps somewhat aggravated
by the clergy, brought discredit upon the party, and
checked the progress of that sect, which had embraced
the speculative doctrines of Wickliffe, and at the same
time aspired to a reformation of ecclesiastical abuses.</P>
<P>THESE two points were the great objects of the Lol∣lards;
but the generality of the nation was not affected
in the same degree by both of them. Common sense
and obvious reflection had discovered to the people the
advantages of a reformation in discipline; but the age
was not yet so far advanced as to be seized with the spirit
of controversy, or to enter into those abstruse doctrines,
which the Lollards endeavoured to propagate throughout
the kingdom. The very notion of heresy alarmed the
generality of the people: Innovation in fundamental
principles was suspicious: Curiosity was not, as yet, a
proper counter-balance to authority: And even many,
who were the greatest friends to the reformation of
abuses, were anxious to express their detestation of the
speculative tenets of the Wicliffites, which, they feared,
threw disgrace on so good a cause. This turn of thought
appears evidently in the proceedings of the parliament,
which was summoned immediately after the detection of
Cobham's conspiracy. That assembly passed severe laws
against the new heretics: They enacted, that whoever
was convicted of Lollardy before the Ordinary, besides
suffering capital punishment according to the laws for∣merly
established, should also forfeit his lands and goods
to the King; and that the chancellor, treasurer, justices
of the two benches, sheriffs, justices of peace, and all
the chief magistrates in every city and borough, should
take an oath to use their utmost endeavours for the ex∣tirpation
of heresy<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">2 Hen. V. chap. 7.</NOTE>. Yet this very parliament, when
<PB N="97" REF="107"/>
the King demanded supply, renewed the offer formerly
pressed upon his father, and entreated him to seize all
the ecclesiastical revenues, and convert them to the use
of the crown<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 35.</NOTE>. The clergy were alarmed: They could
offer the King no bribe which was equivalent: They
only agreed to confer on him all the priories alien, which
depended on capital abbies in Normandy, and had been
bequeathed them when that province remained united to
England: And Chicheley, now archbishop of Canterbury,
endeavoured to divert the blow, by giving occupation to
the King, and by persuading him to undertake a war
against France, in order to recover his lost rights to that
kingdom<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibid. fol. 35, 36.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was the dying injunction of the late King to his
son, not to allow the English to remain long in peace,
which was apt to breed intestine commotions; but to
employ them in foreign expeditions, by which the prince
might acquire honour; the nobility, in sharing his dan∣gers,
might attach themselves to his person; and all the
restless spirits find occupation for their inquietude. The
natural disposition of Henry sufficiently inclined him to
follow this advice, and the civil disorders of France,
which had been lengthened out beyond those of England,
opened a full career to his ambition.</P>
<P>THE death of Charles V.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1415.</NOTE> which followed so soon after
that of Edward III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of France.</NOTE> and the youth of his son, Charles VI.
put the two kingdoms for some time in a similar situation;
and it was not to be apprehended, that either of them,
during a minority, would be able to make much advan∣tage
of the weakness of the other. The jealousies also
between Charles's three uncles, the dukes of Anjou,
Berri, and Burgundy, had distracted the affairs of France
rather more than those between the dukes of Lancaster,
York, and Glocester, Richard's three uncles, disordered
<PB N="98" REF="108"/>
those of England; and had carried off the attention of
the French nation from any vigorous enterprize against
foreigners. But in proportion as Charles advanced in
years, the factions were composed; his two uncles, the
dukes of Anjou and Burgundy, died; and the King
himself, assuming the government, gave symptoms of
genius and spirit, which revived the drooping hopes of
his country. This promising state of affairs was not of
long continuance: The unhappy prince fell suddenly into
a fit of frenzy, which rendered him incapable of exer∣cising
his authority; and tho' he recovered from this dis∣order,
he was so subject to relapses, that his judgment
was gradually, but sensibly impaired, and no steady plan
of government could be pursued by him. The admini∣stration
of affairs was disputed between his brother,
Lewis, duke of Orleans, and his cousin german, John
duke of Burgundy: The propinquity to the crown
pleaded in favour of the former: The latter, who, in
right of his mother, had inherited the county of Flan∣ders,
which he annexed to his father's extensive domi∣nions,
derived a lustre from his superior power: The
people were divided between these contending princes:
And the King, now resuming and now dropping his
authority, kept the victory undecided, and prevented any
regular settlement of the state, by the final prevalence of
either party.</P>
<P>AT length, the dukes of Orleans and Burgundy,
seeming to be moved by the cries of the nation and by the
interposition of common friends, agreed to bury all past
quarrels in oblivion, and to enter into strict amity to∣gether:
They swore before the altar to the sincerity of
this friendship; the priest administered the sacrament to
both of them; they gave to each other every pledge,
which could be deemed sacred among men: But all this
solemn preparation was only a cover for the basest trea∣chery,
<PB N="99" REF="109"/>
which was deliberately meditated by the duke of
Orleans. He made his rival be assassinated in the
streets of Paris: He endeavoured for some time to con∣ceal
the part which he took in the crime: But being de∣tected,
he embraced a resolution still more criminal and
more dangerous to society, by openly avowing and justi∣fying
it<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">La Laboureur, liv. xxvii. chap. 23, 24.</NOTE>.
The parliament of Paris itself, the tribunal
of justice, heard the harangues of the duke's advocate
in defence of assassination, which he denominated ty∣rannicide;
and that assembly, partly influenced by faction,
partly overawed by power, pronounced no sentence of
condemnation against this detestable doctrine<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ibid. liv. 27. chap. 27. Monstrelet, chap. 39.</NOTE>. The
same question was afterwards agitated before the council
of Constance; and it was with difficulty, that a feeble
decision, in favour of the contrary opinion, was pro∣cured
from these fathers of the church, the ministers of
peace and of religion. But the mischievous effects of
that tenet, had they been before any wise doubtful, ap∣peared
sufficiently from the present incidents. The com∣mission
of this crime, which destroyed all trust and secu∣rity,
rendered the war implacable between the French parties,
and cut off every means of peace and accommo∣dation.
The princes of the blood, conspiring with the young
duke of Orleans; and his brothers, made violent
war on the duke of Burgundy; and the unhappy King,
seized sometimes by one party, sometimes by another,
transferred alternately to each of them the appearance of
legal authority. The provinces were laid waste by mutual
depredations: Assassinations were every where committed
from the animosity of the several leaders; or what was
equally terrible, executions were ordered without any
legal or free trial, by pretended courts of judicature.
The whole kingdom was distinguished into two parties,
<PB N="100" REF="110"/>
the Burgundians, and the Armagnacs; so the adherents
of the young duke of Orleans were called, from the
count of Armagnac, father-in-law to that prince. The
city of Paris, distracted between them, but inclining
more to the Burgundians, was a perpetual scene of blood
and violence; the King and royal family were often de∣tained
captives in the hands of the populace; their faith∣ful
ministers were butchered or imprisoned before
their
face; and it was dangerous for any man, amidst these
enraged factions, to be distinguished by a strict adherence
to the principles of probity and honour.</P>
<P>DURING this scene of general violence, there rose into
some consideration a body of men, which usually makes
no figure in public transactions even in the most peaceful
times; and that was the university of Paris, whose opi∣nions
were sometimes required, and more frequently of∣fered,
in the multiplied disputes between the parties.
The schism, by which the church was at that time di∣vided,
and which occasioned frequent controversies in the
university, had raised the masters to an unusual degree of
importance; and this connexion between literature and
superstition had bestowed on the former a weight to which
reason and knowledge are not, of themselves, any wise
intitled among men. But there was another society
whose sentiments were much more decisive at Paris, the
fraternity of butchers, who, under the direction of their
ringleaders, had declared for the duke of Burgundy, and
committed the most violent outrages against the opposite
party. To counterbalance their power, the Armagnacs
made interest with the fraternity of carpenters; the po∣pulace
ranged themselves on the one side or the other;
and the fate of the capital depended on the prevalence of
either party.</P>
<P>THE advantage, which might be made of these con∣fusions,
was easily perceived in England; and according
<PB N="101" REF="111"/>
to the maxims, which usually prevail among nations, it
was determined to lay hold of the favourable opportunity.
The late King, who was courted by both the French
parties, fomented the quarrel, by alternately sending as∣sistance
to both; but the present sovereign, impelled by
the vigour of youth and the ardour of ambition, de∣termined
to push his advantages to a greater length, and
to carry a violent war into that distracted kingdom. But
while he was making preparations for that end, he tried
to effectuate his purpose by negotiation; and he sent
over ambassadors to Paris, offering a perpetual peace and
alliance; but demanding Catharine, the French King's
daughter, in marriage, two millions of crowns as her
portion, the payment of one million six hundred thou∣sand
as the arrears of King John's ransom, and the im∣mediate
possession and full sovereignty of Normandy and
of all the other provinces, which had been ravished from
England by the arms of Philip Augustus; together with
the superiority of Brittany and Flanders<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ix. p. 208.</NOTE>. Such exorbi∣tant
demands showed, that he was sensible of the present
miserable condition of France; and the terms, offered by
the French court, tho' much inferior, discovered their
consciousness of the same melancholy truth. They were
willing to give him the princess in marriage, to pay him
eight hundred thousand crowns, to resign the entire so∣vereignty
of Guienne, and to annex to that province the
country of Perigord, Rovergue, Xaintonge, the Angou∣mois,
and other territories<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 211. It is reported by some historians (see Hist. Croyl. Cont. p. 500) that the Dauphin, in derision of Henry's claims and dis∣solute character, sent him a box of tennis balls; intimating that these implements of play were better adapted to him than the instruments of war. But this story is by no means credible; the grea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> concessions made by the court of France, show, that they had already entertained a just idea of Henry's character, as well as of their own situation.</NOTE>. As Henry rejected these
<PB N="102" REF="112"/>
conditions, and scarce hoped that his own demands
would be complied with, he never interrupted a mo∣ment
his preparations for war, and having assembled a
great fleet and army at Southampton, having invited all
the nobility and military men of the kingdom to attend
him by the hopes of glory and of conquest, he came to
the sea-side, with a purpose of embarking on his expe∣dition.</P>
<P>BUT while Henry was meditating conquests upon his
neighbours, he unexpectedly found himself in danger
from a conspiracy at home, which was happily detected
in its infancy. The earl of Cambridge, second son of
the late duke of York, having espoused the sister of the
earl of Marche, had zealously embraced the interests of
that family; and had held some conferences with the
lord Scrope of Masham, and Sir Thomas Grey of Heton,
about the means of recovering to that nobleman his just
right to the crown of England. The conspirators, so
soon as they were detected, acknowledged their guilt to
the King<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ix. p. 300. T. Livii, p. 8.</NOTE>; and Henry proceeded without delay to their
trial and condemnation. The utmost that could be ex∣pected
of the best King in those ages, was, that he
would so far observe the essentials of justice, as not to
make an innocent person a victim to his severity: But
as to the formalities of law, which are often as mate∣rial
as the essentials themselves, they were sacrificed
without scruple to the least interest or convenience. A
jury of commoners was summoned: The three conspi∣rators
were indicted before them: The constable of South∣ampton
castle swore, that they had separately confessed their
guilt to him: Without other evidence, Sir Thomas
Gray was condemned and executed: But as the earl of
Cambridge and lord Scrope, pleaded the privilege of
<PB N="103" REF="113"/>
their peerage, Henry thought proper to summon a court
of eighteen barons, in which the duke of Clarence pre∣sided:
The evidence, given before the jury, was read
to them: The prisoners, tho' one of them was a prince,
of the blood, were not examined, nor produced in
court, nor heard in their own defence; but received
sentence of death upon this proof, which was every way
irregular and illegal; and the sentence was soon after
executed. The earl of Marche was accused of having
given his approbation to this conspiracy, and received
a general pardon from the King<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ix. p. 303.</NOTE>. He was probably ei∣ther
innocent of the crime imputed to him, or had made
reparation by his early repentance and discovery<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">St. Remi, chap. iv. Godwin, p. 65.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE successes, which the arms of England have,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasion of France.</NOTE> in
different ages, obtained over those of France, have been
much owing to the favourable situation of the former
kingdom. The English, happily seated in an island,
could make advantage of every misfortune which attend∣ed
their neighbours, and were little exposed to the dan∣ger
of retaliation. They never left their own country,
but when conducted by a King of extraordinary genius,
or found their enemy divided by intestine factions, or
were supported by a powerful alliance on the con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inent;
and as all these circumstances concurred at present to fa∣vour
their enterprize, they had reason to expect from it
a proportionable success. The duke of Burgundy, expel∣led
France by a combination of the princes, had been
secretly soliciting the alliance of England<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ix. p. 137, 138.</NOTE>; and Henry
knew, that that prince, tho' he scrupled at first to join
the inveterate enemy of his country, would willingly, if
he saw any probability of success, both assist him with
his Flemish subjects, and draw over to the same cause
<PB N="104" REF="114"/>
all his numerous partizans in France. Trusting there∣fore
to this circumstance, but without establishing any
concert with the duke, he put to sea, and landed near
Harfleur,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th Au∣gust.</NOTE> at the head of an army of 6000 men at arms,
and 24,000 foot, mostly archers. He immediately began
the siege of that place, which was valiantly defended by
the lords d'Estoûville, de Guitri, de Gaucourt, and
others of the French nobility: But as the garrison was
weak, and the fortifications in bad repair, they were at
last obliged to capitulate; and they promised to surrender
if they received no succour before the eighteenth of Sep∣tember.
The day came, and there was no appearance
of a French army to relieve them: Yet they still de∣layed,
on various pretences, to open their gates; till
Henry, incensed at their breach of faith, ordered a general
assault, took the town by storm, and put all the garrison
to the sword; except some gentlemen, whom the victo∣rious
army, in hopes of reaping profit by their ransom,
were induced to spare<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">De Laboureur, liv. 35. chap. 4, 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE fatigues of this siege, and the unusual heat of the
season, had so wasted the English army, that Henry
could enter on no farther enterprize. and was obliged to
think of returning into England. He had dismissed his
transports, which could not safely anchor in an open
road upon the enemy's coast: and he lay under a neces∣sity
of marching by land to Calais, before he could reach
a place of safety. A numerous French army of 14,000
men at arms and 40,000 foot was by this time assembled
in Normandy under the constable d' Albert; a force,
which, if prudently conducted, was sufficient either to
trample down the English in the open field, or to har∣rass
and reduce to nothing their small army, before they
could finish so long and difficult a march. Henry, there∣fore,
<PB N="105" REF="115"/>
very cautiously offered to sacrifice his conquest of
Harfleur for a safe passage to Calais; but his proposal
being rejected by the French court, he determined to
force his way by valour and policy thro' all the oppo∣sition
of the enemy<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Laboureur, liv. 35. chap. 6.</NOTE>. That he might not discourage his
own army by the appearance of flight, or expose them to
those hazards which naturally attend precipitate marches,
he made very slow and deliberate journies<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">T. Livii, p. 12.</NOTE>, till he reach∣ed
the Somme, which he proposed to pass at the ford of
Blanquetague, the same place where Edward, in a like
situation, had before escaped from Philip de Valois. But
he found the ford rendered impassable by the precaution of
the French general, and guarded by a strong body on the
opposite bank<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">St. Remi, chap. 58.</NOTE>; and he was therefore obliged to march
higher up the river, in order to seek for a safe passage.
He was continually harrassed on his march by flying
parties of the enemy; saw bodies of troops on the other
side ready to oppose every attempt; his provisions were
cut off; his soldiers languished with sickness and fatigue;
and his affairs seemed to be reduced to a desperate situa∣tion:
When he was so dexterous or so fortunate as to
seize by surprize a passage near St. Quintin, which had
not been sufficiently guarded, and he safely carried over
his army<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">T. Livii, p. 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY then bent his march northwards to Calais;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Azincour.</NOTE>
but he was still exposed to great and imminent danger
from the enemy, who had also passed the Somme, and
threw themselves full in his way, with a purpose of in∣tercepting
his retreat. After he had passed the small
river of Ternois at Blangi,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th Octr.</NOTE> he was surprized to observe
from the heights the whole French army drawn up in
the plains of Azincour, and so posted that it was impos∣sible
<PB N="106" REF="116"/>
for him to proceed on his march, without coming
to an engagement. Nothing in appearance could be
more unequal than the battle upon which all his safety
and his fortunes depended. The English army were
little more than half the number, which had disembarked
at Harffieur; and they laboured under every discourage∣ment
and necessity. The enemy were four times more
numerous; were headed by the Dauphin and all the
princes of the blood; and were plentifully supplied with
provisions of every kind. Henry's situation was exactly
similar to that of Edward at Cressy, and that of the Black
Prince at Poictiers; and the memory of these great
events, inspiring the English with courage, made them
hope for a like deliverance from their present difficulties.
The King likewise observed the same prudent conduct
which had been followed by these great commanders.
He drew up his army on a narrow ground between two
woods, which guarded each flank; and he patiently ex∣pected
in that posture the attack of the enemy<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">St. Remi, chap. 62.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HAD the French constable been able, either to reason
justly upon the present circumstances of the two armies,
or to profit by past experience, he had declined a com∣bat,
and had waited till necessity, obliging the English
to advance, had made them relinquish the advantages of
their situation. But the impetuous valour of the French
nobility, and a vain confidence in superior numbers,
brought on this fatal action, which proved the source of
infinite calamities to their country. The French archers
on horseback and their men at arms, crowded in their
ranks, advanced upon the English archers, who had
fixed pallisadoes in their front to break the impression of
the enemy, and who safely plyed them, from behind that
defence, with a shower of arrows, which nothing could
<PB N="107" REF="117"/>
resist<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 392. T. Livii, p. 19. La Laboureur, liv. 35. chap. 7. Monstrelet, chap. 147.</NOTE>. The clay soil, moistened by some rain, which
had lately fallen, proved another obstacle to the force of
the French cavalry: The wounded men and horses dis∣composed
their ranks: The narrow compass, in which
they were pent, hindered them from recovering any or∣der:
The whole army was a scene of confusion, terror,
and dismay: And Henry, perceiving his advantage, or∣dered
the English, archers, who were light and unimcum∣bered,
to advance upon the enemy, and seize the mo∣ment
of victory. They fell with their battle-axes upon
the French, who, in their present posture, were incapable
either of flying or of making defence: They hewed them
in pieces without resistance<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 393. Ypod. Neust. p. 584.</NOTE>. And being seconded by
the men at arms, who also pushed on against the enemy,
they covered the field with the killed, wounded, dis∣mounted,
and overthrown. After all appearance of op∣position
was over, the English had leisure to make pri∣soners;
and having advanced with uninterrupted success
to the open plain, they there saw the remains of the
French rear-guard, which still maintained the appearance
of a line of battle. At the same time, they heard an
alarm from behind: Some gentlemen of Picardy, having
collected about 600 peasants, had fallen upon the Eng∣lish
baggage, and were doing execution on the dis∣armed
followers of the camp, who fled before them.
Henry, seeing the enemy on all sides of him, began to
entertain apprehensions from his prisoners; and he
thought it necessary to issue general orders for putting
them to death<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">T. Livii, p. 20. Le Laboureur, liv. 35. chap. 7. Sr. Remi, chap. 62. Monstrelet, chap. 147. Hall, fol. 50.</NOTE>: But on the discovery of the truth, he
stopped the slaughter, and was still able to save a great
number.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="118"/>
No battle was ever more fatal to France, by the num∣ber
of princes and nobility, slain or taken prisoners.
Among the former were the constable himself, the count
de Nevers and the duke of Brabant, brothers to the duke
of Burgundy, the count de Vaudemont, brother to the
duke of Lorraine, the duke of Alençon, the duke of
Barre, the count de Marle. The most eminent prisoners
were the dukes of Orleans and Bourbon, the counts
d'Eu, Vendôme, and Richemont, and the mareschal
de Boucicaut. An archbishop of Sens also perished fight∣ing
in this battle. The killed are computed on the
whole to have amounted to ten thousand men; and as
the slaughter fell chiefly upon the cavalry, it is pretend∣ed,
that, of these, eight thousand were gentlemen<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">St. Remi, chap. 64. This author says he was present in the battle. Monstrelet, chap. 148. makes the number amount to 8400.</NOTE>.
Henry was master of 14,000 prisoners. The person of
chief note, who fell among the English, was the duke
of York, who perished fighting by the King's side, and
had an end more honourable than his life. He was suc∣ceeded
in his honours and fortune by his nephew, son
to the earl of Cambridge, executed in the beginning of
the year. All the English who were slain, exceeded
not forty<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 393. Otterbourne, p. 277. St. Remi, chap. 64.</NOTE>; tho' some writers make the numbers more
considerable<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Monstrelet, chap. 147.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE three great battles of Cressy, Poictiers, and A∣zincour
bore a singular resemblance to each other, in their
most considerable circumstances. In all of them, there
appears the same temeritty in the English princes, who,
without any object of moment, merely for the sake of
plunder, had ventured so far into the enemies country as
to leave themselves no resource; and unless saved by the
utmost imprudence in the French commanders, were,
<PB N="109" REF="119"/>
from their very situation, exposed to inevitable destruc∣tion.
But allowance being made for this temeriy, which,
according to the irregular plans of war, followed in those
ages, seems to have been, in some measure, unavoidable;
there appears, in the day of action, the same presence of
mind, dexterity, courage, firmness, and precaution on
the part of the English: The same precipitation, confu∣sion,
and vain confidence on the part of the French:
And the events were such as might have been expected
from such opposite conduct. The immediate conse∣quences
too of these three great victories were similar:
Instead of pushing the French with vigour, and taking
advantage of their consternation, the English princes,
after their victory, seem rather to have relaxed their
efforts, and to have allowed the enemy leisure to recover
from his losses. Henry interrupted not his march a mo∣ment
after the battle of Azincour; he carried his pri∣soners
to Calais, and from thence to England; he even
concluded a truce with the enemy; and it was not till
after an interval of two years that any body of English
troops appeared in France.</P>
<P>THE poverty of all the European princes, and the
small resources of their kingdoms, were the causes of
these continual interruptions in their hostilities; and
tho' the maxims of war were in general very destructive,
their military operations were mere incursions, which,
without any settled plan, they carried on against each
other. The lustre, however, attending the victory of
Azincour, procured some supplies from the English par∣liament;
tho' still unequal to the expences of a campaign.
They granted Henry an entire fifteenth of moveables;
and they conferred on him <HI>for life</HI> the duties of tonnage
and poundage, and the subsidies on the exportation of
wool and leather. This concession is more considerable
than that which had been granted to Richard II. by his
<PB N="110" REF="120"/>
last parliament, and which was afterwards, on his depo∣sition,
made so great an article of charge against him.</P>
<P>BUT during this interruption of hostilities from Eng∣land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of France.</NOTE>
France was exposed to all the furies of civil war;
and the several parties became every day more enraged
against each other. The duke of Burgundy, in hopes
that the French ministers and generals were entirely dis∣credited,
by the misfortune at Azincour, advanced with
a great army to Paris, and attempted to re-instate him∣self
in possession of the government, as well as of the
King's person. But his partizans in that city were over∣awed
by the court, and kept in subjection: The duke
despaired of success: And he retired with his forces,
which he immediately dispersed in the Low Countries<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Le Laboureur, liv. 35. chap. 10.</NOTE>.
He was next year invited to make a new attempt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1416.</NOTE> by
some violent quarrels, which broke out in the royal
family. The Queen, Isabella, daughter of the duke of
Bavaria, who had been hitherto an inveterate enemy to
the Burgundian faction, had received a great injury from
the other party, which the implacable spirit of that
princess was never able to forgive. The public neces∣sities
obliged the count d'Armagnac, created constable of
France in place of d' Albert, to seize the great treasures
which Isabella had amassed; and when she expressed her
displeasure at this injury, he inspired into the weak
mind of the King some jealousies against her conduct,
and pushed him to seize and put to the torture, and after∣wards
throw into the Seine, Bois-bourdon, her favourite,
whom he accused of a commerce of gallantry with that
princess. The Queen herself was sent to Tours, and
confined under a guard<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">St. Remi, chap. 74.</NOTE>; and after these multiplied
insults, she no longer scrupled to enter into a corres∣pondence
<PB N="111" REF="121"/>
with the duke of Burgundy. As her son, the
Dauphin Charles, a youth of sixteen, was entirely go∣verned
by the faction of Armagnac, she extended her
animosity to him, and sought his destruction with the
most unrelenting hatred. She had soon an opportunity
of rendering her unnatural purpose effectual. The duke
of Burgundy, in concert with her, entered France at the
head of a great army: He made himself master of
Amiens, Abbeville, Dourlens, Montreüil, and other
towns in Picardy; Senlis, Rheims, Chalons, Troye,
and Auxerre, declared themselves for his party<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">St. Remi, chap. 79.</NOTE>. He
got possession of Beaumont, Pontoise, Vernon, Meulant,
Montlheri, towns in the neighbourhood of Paris; and
carrying farther his progress towards the west, he seized
Etampes, Chartres, and other fortresses; and was at last
able to deliver the Queen, who fled to Troye, and de∣clared
openly against those ministers, who, she said,
detained her husband in captivity<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">St. Remi, chap. 81. Monstrelet, chap. 178, 179.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MEAN-WHILE, the partizans of Burgundy raised a
commotion in Paris, which always inclined to that fac∣tion.
Lile-Adam, one of the duke's captains, was re∣ceived
into the city in the night-time, and headed the
insurrectiion of the people, which in a moment became
so impetuous, that nothing could oppose it. The per∣son
of the King was seized: The Dauphin made his
escape with difficulty: Great numbers of the faction of
Armagnac were immediately butchered: The count
himself, and many persons of note, were thrown into
prison: Murders were daily committed from private ani∣mosity,
under pretence of faction: And the populace, not
satiated with their fury, and deeming the course of public
justice too dilatory, broke open the prisons, and put to
<PB N="112" REF="122"/>
death the count d'Armagnac, and all the other nobility
who were there confined<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">St. Remi, chap. 85, 86. Monstrelet, chap. 118.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE France was in such furious combustion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1417.</NOTE> and
was so ill prepared to resist a foreign enemy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New inva∣sion of France. 11st August.</NOTE> Henry, hav∣ing
collected some treasures, and levied an army, landed
in Normandy at the head of 25,000 men; and met with
no considerable opposition from any quarter. He made
himself master of Falaise and Cherbourg; Evreux and
Caen submitted to him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1418.</NOTE> Pont de l'Arche opened its
gates; and Henry, having subdued all the lower Nor∣mandy,
and received a reinforcement of 15000 men
from England<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 400.</NOTE>, formed the siege of Roüen, which was
defended by a garrison of 4000 men, seconded by the
inhabitants, to the number of 15000<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">St. Remi, chap. 91.</NOTE>. The cardinal
des Ursins here attempted to incline him towards peace,
and to moderate his pretensions: But the King replied
to him in such terms as shewed that he was fully sen∣sible
of all his present advantages: “Do you not see,”
said he, “that God has led me hither as by the hand?
France has no sovereign: I have just pretensions on
that kingdom: Every thing is here in the utmost con∣fusion:
No one thinks of resisting me. Can I have a
more sensible proof, that that Being, who disposes of
empires, has determined to put the crown of France
upon my head?”<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Juvenal des Ursins.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT tho' Henry had opened his mind to this scheme
of ambition, he still continued to negotiate with his ene∣mies,
and endeavoured to obtain more secure, tho' less
considerable advantages. He made, at the same time,
offers of peace to both parties; to the Queen and duke
<PB N="113" REF="123"/>
of Burgundy on the one hand, who having possession of
the King's person, carried the appearance of legal autho∣rity<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ix. p. 717. 749.</NOTE>; and to the Dauphin on the other, who being the
undoubted heir of the monarchy, was adhered to by
every one that had a regard to the true interests of their
country<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. ix. p. 626, &amp;c.</NOTE>.
These two parties also carried on a continual
negotiation with each other. The terms proposed on
all sides were perpetually varying: The events of the
war, and the intrigues of the cabinet, intermingled with
each other: And the fate of France remained long in
this uncertainty. After many negotiations, Henry offered
the Queen and the duke of Burgundy to make peace
with them, to espouse the princess Catharine, to accept
of all the provinces ceded to Edward III. by the treaty
of Bretigni, with the addition of Normandy, which he
was to receive in full and entire sovereignty<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. ix. p. 762.</NOTE>. These
terms were accepted of:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1419.</NOTE> There remained only some cir∣cumstances
to adjust, in order to the full completion of
the treaty: But in this interval the duke of Burgundy
secretly finished his treaty with the Dauphin; and these
two princes agreed to share the royal authority during
King Charles's life, and to unite their arms in expelling
foreign enemies<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. ix. p. 776. St. Remi, chap. 95.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS alliance, which seemed to cut off from Henry
all hopes of farther success, proved in the issue the most
favourable event which could have happened for his pre∣tensions.
Whether the Dauphin and duke of Burgundy
were ever sincere in their mutual engagements is un∣certain;
but very fatal effects resulted from their
momentary and seeming union. The two princes
agreed to an interview, in order to concert the means
<PB N="114" REF="124"/>
of rendering effectual their common attack of the Eng∣lish;
but how both or either of them could with safety
venture upon this conference, it seemed somewhat
difficult to contrive. The assassination perpetrated by
the duke of Burgundy, and still more, his open avowal
of the deed, and defence of the doctrine, tended to
dissolve all the bands of civil society; and even men of
honour, who detested the example, might deem it just,
on a favourable opportunity, to retaliate upon the au∣thor.
The duke, therefore, who neither dared to give,
nor could pretend to require any trust, agreed to all the
contrivances for mutual security, which were proposed
by the ministers of the Dauphin. The two princes
came to Montereau: The duke lodged in the castle;
the Dauphin in the town, which was divided from the
castle by the river Yonne: The bridge between them
was chosen for the place of interview: Two high rails
were drawn across the bridge: The gates on each side
were guarded, the one by the officers of the dauphin, the
other by those of the duke: The princes were to enter
into the intermediate space by the opposite gates, accom∣panied
each by ten persons; and with all these marks
of diffidence, to conciliate their mutual friendship. But
it appeared, that no precautions are sufficient, where
laws have no place, and where all principles of honour
are utterly abandoned. Tannegui de Chatel, and others
of the Dauphin's retainers, were zealous partizans of the
house of Orleans,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Assassination of the duke of Burgundy.</NOTE> and they determined to seize the oppor∣tunity
of revenging on the assassin the murder of that
prince. They no sooner entered the rails, than they drew
their swords and attacked the duke of Burgundy: His
friends were astonished, and thought not of making any
defence; and all of them either shared his fate, or were
taken prisoners by the retinue of the Dauphin<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">St. Remi, chap. 97. Monstrele<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, chap. 211.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="125"/>
THE extreme youth of this prince, made it doubtful
whether he was admitted into the secret of the conspi∣racy:
But as the deed was committed under his eye'
by his most intimate friends, who still retained their con∣nexions
with him, the blame of the action, which was
certainly more imprudent than criminal, fell entirely up∣on
him. The whole state of affairs was every where
changed by that unexpected incident. The city of
Paris, which was passionately devoted to the family of
Burgundy, broke out into the highest fury against
the Dauphin. The court of King Charles entered from in∣terest
into the same views; and as all the ministers about
that monarch had owed their preferment to the late duke,
and foresaw their downfall if the Dauphin recovered pos∣session
of his father's person, they were concerned to pre∣vent
by any means the success of his enterprize. The
Queen, persevering in her unnatural animosity against her
son, encreased the general flame, and inspired into the
King, as far as he was susceptible of any sentiment,
the same prejudices by which she herself had long been
actuated. But above all, Philip count de Charolois,
now duke of Burgundy, thought himself bound by every
tye of honour and of duty, to revenge the murder of his
father, and to prosecute the assassin to the utmost extre∣mity.
And in this general transport of rage, every con∣sideration
of national and family interest was buried in
oblivion by all parties: The subjection to a foreign
enemy, the expulsion of the lawful heir, the slavery of
the kingdom, appeared but small evils, if they led to the
gratification of the present passion.</P>
<P>THE King of England had, before the death of the
duke of Burgundy, profited extremely by the distractions
of France, and was daily making a considerable progress
in Normandy. He had taken Roüen after an obstinate
<PB N="116" REF="126"/>
siege<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">T. Livii, p. 69. Monstrelet, chap. 201.</NOTE>. He had made himself master of Pontoise and
Gisors: He even threatened Paris, and by the terror of
his power, had obliged the court to remove to Troye:
And in the midst of his successes, he was agreeably sur∣prised,
to find his enemies, instead of combining against
him for their mutual defence, disposed to rush into his
arms, and to make him the instrument of their vengeance
upon each other. A league was immediately concluded
at Arras between him and the duke of Burgundy. That
prince, without stipulating any thing for himself, except
the prosecution of his father's murder, and the marriage
of the duke of Bedford with his sister, was willing to sa∣crifice
the kingdom to Henry's ambition, and he agreed
to every demand, which was made by that monarch. In
order to finish that astonishing treaty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1420.</NOTE> which was to trans∣fer
the crown of France to a stranger, Henry went to
Troye, accompanied by his brothers, the dukes of Cla∣rence
and Glocester; and was there met by the duke of
Burgundy. The imbecility, into which Charles had
fallen, made him incapable of seeing any thing but thro'
the eyes of those who attended him; as they, on their
part, saw every thing thro' the medium of their passions.
The treaty, being already concerted among the parties,
was immediately drawn and signed and ratified: Henry's
will seemed to be a law throughout this whole negotia∣tion:
Nothing was attended to but his advantages.</P>
<P>THE principal articles of the treaty were, that Henry
should espouse the princess Catharine:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Treaty of Troye.</NOTE> That King
Charles, during his lifetime, should enjoy the title and
dignity of King of France: That Henry should be de∣clared
and acknowledged heir of the monarchy, and be
entrusted with the present administration of the govern∣ment:
That that kingdom should pass to his heirs gene∣ral:
That France and England should for ever be united
<PB N="117" REF="127"/>
under one Kings; but should still retain their several
usages, customs, and privileges: That all the princes,
peers, vassals, and communities of France, should swear,
both that they would adhere to the future succession of
Henry, and pay him present obedience as regent: That
that prince should unite his arms to those of King Charles
and the duke of Burgundy, in order to subdue the ad∣herents
of Charles, the pretended Dauphin: And that
these three princes should make no peace nor truce with
him but by common consent and agreement<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ix. p. 895. St. Remi, chap. 101. Monstrelet, chap. 223.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SUCH was the tenor of this famous treaty; a treaty,
which as nothing but the most violent animosity could
dictate, so nothing but the power of the sword could carry
it into execution. It is hard to say, whether its conse∣quences,
had it taken place, would have proved more
pernicious to England or to France. It must have re∣duced
the former kingdom to the rank of a province: It
would have entirely disjointed the succession of the latter
monarchy, and have brought on the destruction of every
descendant of the royal family: As the houses of Orleans,
Anjou, Alencon, Brittany, Bourbon, and of Burgundy
itself, whose titles were preferable to that of the English
princes, would on that account have been exposed to per∣petual
jealousy and persecution from the sovereign.
There was even a palpable deficiency in Henry's claim,
which no art could palliate. For besides the insuperable
objections, to which Edward IIId's pretensions were ex∣posed,
<HI>he</HI> was not heir to that monarch: If female suc∣cession
was admitted, the right had devolved to the house
of Mortimer: Allowing, that Richard II. was a tyrant,
and that Henry IVth's merits, in deposing him, were so
great towards the English, as to justify that nation for
placing him on the throne; Richard had nowise offended
<PB N="118" REF="128"/>
France, and his rival had merited nothing of that king∣dom:
It could not possibly be pretended, that the crown
of France was become an appendage to that of England;
and that a prince, who, by any means, got possession of
the latter, was, without farther question, intitled to the
former. So that on the whole, it must be allowed, that
Henry's claim to France was, if possible, still more unin∣telligible,
than the title, by which his father had mounted
the throne of England.</P>
<P>BUT tho' all these considerations were overlooked,
amidst the hurry of passions, by which the courts of
France and Burgundy were actuated, they would neces∣sarily
revive during times of more leisure and tranquillity;
and it behoved Henry to push his present advantages,
and allow men no leisure for reason or reflection. In a
few days after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of the King.</NOTE> he espoused the princess, Catharine: He
carried his father-in-law to Paris, and put himself in
possession of that capital: He obtained from the parlia∣ment
and the three estates a ratification of the treaty of Troye: He supported the duke of Burgundy in pro∣curing
a sentence against the murderers of his father:
And he immediately turned his arms with success against
the adherents of the Dauphin, who, so soon as he heard
of the treaty of Troye, took on him the style and autho∣rity
of regent, and appealed to God and his sword for
the maintenance of his title.</P>
<P>THE first place which Henry subdued, was Sens,
which opened its gates after a slight resistance. With the
same facility, he made himself master of Montereau.
The defence of Melun was more obstinate; Barbasan,
the governor, held out for the space of four months
against the besiegers; and it was famine alone which
obliged him to capitulate. Henry promised to spare the
lives of all the garrison, except such as were accomplices
in the murder of the duke of Burgundy; and as Barbasan
himself was suspected to be of the number, his punish∣ment
<PB N="119" REF="129"/>
was demanded by Philip: But the King had the
generosity to intercede for him, and to prevent his execu∣tion<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hollingshed, p. 577.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE necessity of providing supplies both of men and
money obliged Henry to go over to England;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1421.</NOTE> and he
left the duke of Exeter, his uncle, governor of Paris
during his absence. The authority, which naturally at∣tends
success, procured him from the English parlia∣ment
a subsidy of a fifteenth; but if we may judge by
the smallness of this supply, the nation was nowise san∣guine
on their King's victories; and in proportion as the
prospect of their union with France came nearer, they
began to open their eyes, and to see the dangerous conse∣quences
with which it must necessarily be attended. It
was fortunate for Henry, that he had other resources,
besides pecuniary supplies from his native subjects. The
provinces, which he had already conquered, maintained
his troops; and the hopes of farther advantages allured,
to his standard all men of ambitious spirits in England,
who desired to signalize themselves by arms. He assem∣bled
a new army of twenty four thousand archers, and
four thousand horsemen<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Monstrelet, chap. 242.</NOTE>, and marched them to Dover,
the place of embarkation. Every thing had remained in
tranquillity at Paris, under the duke of Exeter; but there
had happened in another quarter of the kingdom a mis∣fortune,
which hastened his departure.</P>
<P>THE detention of the King of Scots in England had
hitherto proved very advantageous to Henry; and by
keeping the regent in awe, had preserved, during the
whole course of the French war, the northern frontier in
tranquillity. But when intelligence arrived in Scotland,
of the progress made by Henry, and the near prospect of
his succession to the crown of France, the nation was
<PB N="120" REF="130"/>
alarmed, and foresaw their own inevitable ruin, if the
subjection of their ally left them to combat alone an
enemy, who was already so much superior to them in
power and riches. The regent entered into the same
views; and tho' he declined an open war with Eng∣land,
he permitted a body of seven thousand Scots, un∣der
the command of the earl of Buchan, his second son,
to be transported into France for the service of the Dau∣phin.
To render this aid ineffectual, Henry had carried
over the young King of Scots, whom he obliged to send
orders to his countrymen to leave the French service;
but the Scots general replied, that he would obey no
commands which came from a King in captivity, and
that a prince, while in the hands of his enemy, was no∣wise
entitled to authority. These troops, therefore, con∣tinued
still to act under the earl of Buchan; and were
employed by the Dauphin to oppose the progress of the
duke of Clarence in Anjou. The two armies encoun∣tered
at Baugé: The English were defeated: The duke
himself was slain by Sir Allan Swinton, a Scots knight,
who commanded a company of men at arms: And the
earls of Somerset<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">His name was John, and he was afterwards created duke of so∣merset. He was grandson of John of Gaunt duke of Lancaster. The earl of Dorset was brother to Somerset, and succeeded him in that title.</NOTE>. Dorset, and Huntingdon, were
taken prisoners<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">St. Remi, chap. 110. Monstrelet, chap. 239. Hall, fol. 76.</NOTE>. This was the first action, which
turned the tide of success against the English; and the
Dauphin, that he might both attach the Scots to his
service, and reward the valour and conduct of the earl
of Buchan, honoured that nobleman with the office of
constable.</P>
<P>BUT the arrival of the King of England, with so
considerable an army, was more than sufficient to repair
<PB N="121" REF="131"/>
this loss. Henry was received at Paris with great expres∣sions
of joy; so obstinate were the prejudices of the peo∣ple:
And he immediately conducted his army to Chartres,
which had long been besieged by the Dauphin. That
prince decamped on the approach of the English; and
being resolved to decline a battle, he retired with his
army<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">St. Remi, chap. 3.</NOTE>. Henry made himself master of Dreux without
a blow: He laid siege to Meaux at the sollicitation of
the Parisians, who were much incommoded by the gar∣rison
of that place. This enterprize employed the Eng∣lish
arms during the space of eight months: The bastard
of Vaurus, the governor of Meaux, distinguished him∣self
by an obstinate defence; but was at last obliged to
surrender at discretion. The cruelty of this officer was
equal to his bravery: He was accustomed to hang with∣out
distinction all the English and Burgundians who fell
into his hands: And Henry, in revenge of his barba∣rity,
ordered him immediately to be hanged on the same
tree, which he had made the instrument of his inhuman
executions<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. x. p. 212. T. Livii, p. 93, 93. St. Remi, chap. 116. Monstrelet, chap. 260.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS success was followed by the surrender of many
other places in the neighbourhood of Paris, which held
for the Dauphin: That prince was chaced beyond the
Loire, and almost totally abandoned all the northern pro∣vinces:
He was even pursued into the south by the united
arms of the English and Burgundians, and threatened
with total destruction: Notwithstanding the bravery and
fidelity of his captains, he saw himself unequal to his
enemies in the open field; and found it necessary to tem∣porize,
and to avoid all hazardous actions with a rival,
who had gained so much the ascendant over him. And
to crown all the other prosperities of Henry, his Queen
<PB N="122" REF="132"/>
was delivered of a son, who was called by his father's
name, and whose birth was celebrated by rejoicings no
less pompous and no less sincere at Parts than at London.
The infant prince seemed to be universally regarded as
the future heir of both monarchies.</P>
<P>BUT the glory of Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1422.</NOTE> when it had nearly reached
the summit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death</NOTE>, was stopped short by the hand of nature;
and all his mighty projects vanished into smoke. He
was seized with a fistula, which the surgeons at that time
had not skill enough to cure; and he was at last sensible,
that his distemper was mortal, and that his end was ap∣proaching.
He sent for his brother the duke of Bedford,
the earl of Warwic, and a few more noblemen, whom
he had honoured with his confidence; and he delivered
to them, in great tranquillity, his last will with regard to
the government of his kingdom and family. He entreated
them to continue; towards his infant son, the same fidelity
and attachment, which they had always professed to him
during his lifetime, and which had been cemented by so
many mutual good offices. He expressed his indifference
on the approach of death; and tho' he regreted, that
he must leave unfinished a work so happily begun, he
declared himself confident, that the final acquisition of
France would be the effect of their prudence and valour.
He left the regency of that kingdom to his eldest bro∣ther,
the duke of Bedford; that of England to his
younger, the duke of Glocester; and the care of his
son's person to the earl of Warwic. He recommended
to all of them an anxious care to maintain the friendship
of the duke of Burgundy; and advised them never to
give liberty to the French princes taken at Azincour, till
his son was of age, and could himself hold the reins of
government. And he conjured them, if the success of
their arms should not enable them to place young Henry
<PB N="123" REF="133"/>
on the throne of France, never at least to make peace
with that kingdom, unless the enemy, by the cession of
Normandy, and its annexation to the crown of England,
made compensation for all the hazards and expence of
his enterprize<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Monstrele<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, chap. 26<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Hall, fol. 80.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HE next applied himself to his devotions, and ordered
his chaplain to read the seven penitential psalms. When
he came to that passage of the fifty-first psalm; <HI>Build
thou the walls of Jerusalem;</HI> he interrupted him, and pro∣fessed his serious intention, after he should have fully
subdued France, to have made a crusade against the in∣fidels,
and recover possession of the Holy Land<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">St. Remi, chap. 118. Monstreler, chap. 265.</NOTE>. So
ingenious are men in deceiving themselves, that Henry
forgot in those moments, all the blood spilt by his ambi∣tion;
and received comfort from this late and feeble re∣solve,
which, as the mode of these enterprizes was now
past, he certainly would never have carried into execu∣tion.
He expired in the thirty fourth year of his age and the tenth of his reign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">31 August.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS prince possessed many eminent virtues; and if
we give indulgence to ambition in a monarch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and charac∣ter of the King.</NOTE> or
rank it, as the vulgar are inclined to do, among his vir∣tues,
they were unstained by any considerable blemish.
His abilities appeared, equally in the cabinet and in
the field; the boldness of his enterprizes was no less re∣markable
than his personal valour in conducting them.
He had the talent of attaching his friends by affability,
and of gaining his enemies by address and clemency.
The English, dazzled by the lustre of his character,
still more than by that of his victories, were reconciled
to the defects of his title: The French almost forgot
that he was an enemy: And his care of maintaining justice
in his civil administration, and preserving discipline in
<PB N="124" REF="134"/>
his armies, made some amends to both nations for the
calamities inseparable from those wars, in which his short
reign was almost entirely occupied. That he could for∣give
the earl of Marche, who had a better right to the
throne than himself, is a sure proof of his magnanimity;
and that the earl relied so entirely on his friendship is no
less a proof of his established character for candour and
sincerity. There remain in history few instances of such
mutual trust; and still fewer where neither party found
reason to repent it.</P>
<P>THE exterior figure of this great prince, as well as
his deportment, was engaging. His stature was some∣what
above the middle size; his countenance beautiful;
his limbs genteel and slender, but full of vigour; and he
excelled in all warlike and manly exercises<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">T. Livii, p. 4.</NOTE>. He left
by his Queen, Catherine of France, only one son, not
full nine months old; whose misfortunes in the course of
his life, surpassed all the glories and successes of his fa∣ther.</P>
<P>IN less than two months after Henry's death, Charles
VI. of France, his father-in-law, terminated his unhap∣py
life. He had, for several years, possessed only the ap∣pearance
of royal authority: Yet was this circumstance
of considerable moment to the English; and divided the
duty and affections of the French between them and the
Dauphin. This prince was proclaimed and crowned
King of France at Poictiers, under the name of Charles
VII. Rheims, the place where that ceremony was
usually performed, was at that time in the hands of his
enemies.</P>
<P>CATHERINE OF France, Henry's widow, married
soon after his death, a Welch gentleman, Sir Owen
Tudor, said to be descended from the antient princes of
<PB N="125" REF="135"/>
that country: She bore him two sons, Edmund and
Jasper, of whom, the eldest was created earl of Rich∣mond;
the second earl of Pembroke. The family of
Tudor, first raised to distinction by this alliance,
mounted afterwards the throne of England.</P>
<P>THE long schism,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Miscellane∣ous trans∣actions.</NOTE> which had divided the Latin church
for near forty years, was finally terminated in this reign
by the council of Constancei which deposed the Pope,
John XXIII. for his crimes, and elected Martin V. in his
place, who was acknowledged by almost all the kingdoms
of Europe. This great and unusual act of authority in
the council gave the Roman Pontiffs ever after a mortal
antipathy to these assemblies. The same jealousy,
which had long prevailed in most European countries,
between the civil aristocracy and monarchy, now also
took place between these powers in the ecclesiastical
body. But the great separation of the bishops in the
several states, and the difficulty of assembling them, gave
the Pope a mighty advantage, and made it more easy for
him to collect all the power of the Hierarchy in his own
person. The cruelty and treachery which attended the
punishments of John Huss and Jerome of Prague, the
unhappy disciples of Wickliffe, who were burned alive
for their errors by this council, prove this melancholy
truth, that toleration is none of the virtues of priests in
any form of ecclesiastical government. But as the Eng∣lish
prince had little or no concern in these great trans∣actions,
we are here the more concise in relating them.</P>
<P>THE first commission of array, which we meet with,
was issued in this reign<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ix. p. 254, 255.</NOTE>. The military part of the feudal
system, which was the most essential circumstance of it,
was entirely dissolved; and could no longer serve for the
defence of the kingdom. Henry, therefore, when he
<PB N="126" REF="136"/>
went to France in 1415, empowered certain commission∣ers
to take a review of all the freemen in each county
able to bear arms, to divide them into companies, and to
keep them in readiness for resisting the enemy. This
was the aera, when the feudal militia gave place to one
which was perhaps still less orderly and regular.</P>
<P>WE have an authentic and exact account of the ordi∣nary
revenues of the crown during this reign; and they
amount only to 55,714 pounds 10 shillings and 10 pence
a-year<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. x. p. 113.</NOTE>. This is nearly the same with the revenues of
Henry III. and the Kings of England had neither become
much richer nor poorer in the course of so many years.
The ordinary expences of the government amounted to
52,507 pounds 16 shillings and 10 pence: So that the
King had of surplus only 3206 pounds 14 shillings for
the support of his houshold; for his wardrobe; for the
expence of embassies; and other articles. This sum
was nowise sufficient; he was therefore obliged to have
frequent recourse to parliamentary supplies, and was
thus, even in time of peace, not altogether independant
of his people. But wars were a monstrous expence,
which neither the prince's ordinary revenue, nor the ex∣traordinary
supplies, were able to bear; and he was al∣ways
reduced to many miserable shifts, in order to make
any tolerable figure in them. He commonly borrowed
money from all quarters; he pawned his jewels, and
sometimes the crown itself<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 190.</NOTE>; he ran in arrears to his
army; and he was often obliged, notwithstanding all
these expedients, to stop in the midst of his career of
victory, and to grant truces to the enemy. The high
pay which was given to soldiers agreed very ill with this
low revenue. All the extraordinary supplies granted by
parliament to Henry during the course of his reign were
<PB N="127" REF="137"/>
only seven tenths and fifteenths, about 203,000 pounds<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Parliamentary History, vol. ii. p. 168.</NOTE>.
It is easy to compute how soon this money must be ex∣hausted
by armies of 24,000 archers, and 6000 horse;
when each archer had a sixpence a-day<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">It appears from many passages of Rymer, particularly vol. ix. p. 258, that the King paid 20 marks a-year for an archer, which is a good deal above sixpence a-day. The price had risen, as is natural, by raising the denomination of money.</NOTE>, and each horse-man
two shillings. The most splendid successes proved
commonly very fruitless, when supported by so poor a
revenue; and the debts and difficulties, which he there∣by
incurred, made the King pay dear for his victories.
The civil administration, likewise, even in time of peace,
could never be very regular, where the government was
so ill enabled to support itself. Henry a year before his
death owed debts, which had been contracted when he
was prince of Wales<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. x. p. 114.</NOTE>. It was in vain that the parlia∣ment
pretended to restrain him from arbitrary practices,
when he was reduced to such necessities. Ttho' the right
of levying purveyance, for instance, had been ex∣presly
guarded against by the great charter itself,
and was frequently complained of by the commons, it
was found absolutely impracticable to abolish it; and the
parliament at length, submitting to it as a legal preroga∣tive,
contented themselves with enacting laws to limit
and confine it. The duke of Glocester, in the reign of
Richard II. possessed a revenue of 60,000 crowns, (about
30,000 pounds a-year of our present money) as we learn
from Froissart<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Liv. iv. chap. 86.</NOTE>, and was consequently richer than
the King himself, if all circumstances be duly consi∣dered.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that the city of Calais alone was
an annual expence on the crown of 19,119 pounds<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. x. p. 11<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>;
<PB N="128" REF="138"/>
that is, above a third of the common charge of the go∣vernment
in time of peace. This fortress was of no use
to the defence of England, and only gave that kingdom
an inlet to annoy France. Ireland cost two thousand
pounds a-year, over and above its own revenue; which
was certainly very low. Every thing contributes to give
us a very mean idea of the state of Europe in those ages.</P>
<P>FROM the most early times, till the reign of Edward
III. the denomination of money had never been altered:
A pound fterling was still a pound troy; that is, about
three pounds of our present money. That conqueror
was first obliged to innovate in this important article. In
the twentieth year of his reign, he coined twenty-two
shillings out of a pound troy; in his twenty-seventh
year he coined twenty-five shillings But Henry V. who
was also a conqueror, raised still farther the denomina∣tion,
and coined thirty shillings, from a pound troy<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Fleetwood's Chronicon Preciosum, p. 52.</NOTE>:
His revenue therefore would be about 110,000 pounds
of our present money; and by the cheapness of provi∣sions,
would be equivalent to above 330,000 pounds.</P>
<P>NONE of the princes of the house of Lancaster ven∣tured
to impose taxes without consent of parliament:
Their doubtful or bad title became so far of advantage to
the constitution. The rule was then fixed, and could
not safely be broke afterwards even by more absolute
princes.</P>

<P>DURING the reigns of the Lancastrian princes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XX.</NOTE>
the authority of parliament seems to have been
more confirmed, and the privileges of the people more
regarded, than during any former period; and the two
preceding Kings, tho' men of great spirit and abilities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Govern∣ment dur∣ing the mi∣nority.</NOTE>
abstained from such exertions of prerogative, as even
weak princes, whose title was undisputed, were tempted
to think that they might venture upon with Impunity.
The long minority, of which there was now the pros∣pect,
encouraged still farther the lords and commons to
extend their authority; and without paying much regard
to the verbal destination of Henry V. they assumed the
power of giving a new arrangement to the whole admi∣nistration.
They declined altogether the name of <HI>Re∣gent</HI>
<PB N="130" REF="140"/>
with regard to England: They appointed the duke
of Bedford to be <HI>protector</HI> or <HI>guardian</HI> of that kingdom,
a title which they supposed to imply less authority: They
invested the duke of Glocester with the same dignity
during the absence of his elder brother<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. x. p. 261. Cotton, p. 564.</NOTE>; and in order
to limit the power of both these princes, they named a
council, without whose advice and approbation no mea∣sure
of importance could be determined<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 564.</NOTE>. The person
and education of the infant prince was committed to
Henry Beaufort, bishop of Winchester, his great uncle,
and the legitimated son of John of Gaunt, duke of Lan∣caster;
who, as his family could never have any pre∣tensions
to the crown, might safely, they thought, be
intrusted with that important charge<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 83. Monstrelet, vol. ii. p. 27.</NOTE>. The two prin∣ces,
the dukes of Bedford and Glocester, who might
deem themselves injured by this plan of government, yet,
being persons of great integrity and honour, acquiesced
willingly in any appointment, which seemed to give se∣curity
to the public; and as the wars in France appeared
to be the object of greatest moment, they avoided every
dispute, which might throw an obstacle in the way of
these conquests.</P>

French Kings was considered with a superficial eye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of France.</NOTE>
every advantage seemed to be on the side of the former;
and the total expulsion of Charles appeared to be an
event, which might naturally be expected from the su∣perior
power of his rival. Tho' Henry was yet in his
infancy, the administration was devolved on the duke of
Bedford, the most accomplished prince of his age; whose
experience, prudence, valour, and generosity perfectly
qualified him for this high office, and enabled him both
<PB N="131" REF="141"/>
to maintain union among his friends, and to gain the
confidence of his enemies. The whole power of England
was at his command: He was at the head of armies
enured to victory: He was seconded by the most renowned
generals of the age, the earls of Somerset, Warwic,
Salisbury, Suffolk, and Arundel, Sir John Talbot, and
Sir John Fastolfe: And besides Guienne, the antient
inheritance of England, he was master of the capital,
and of all the northern provinces, which were best
enabled to furnish him with supplies both of men and
money, and to assist and support his English forces.</P>
<P>BUT Charles, notwithstanding the present inferiority
of his power, possessed some advantages, derived partly
from his situation, partly from his personal character,
which promised him success, and served, first to con∣troul,
then to overbalance, the superior force and opu∣lence
of his enemies. He was the true and undoubted
heir of the monarchy: Every Frenchman, who knew the
interests, or desired the independance of his country,
turned his eyes towards him as its sole refuge: The ex∣clusion
given him, by the imbecillity of his father, and
the forced or precipitate consent of the states, had plainly
no validity: That spirit of faction, which had blinded
the people, could not long hold them in so gross a delu∣sion:
Their national and inveterate hatred against the
English, the authors of all their miseries, must soon re∣vive,
and give them an indignation at bending their
necks under the yoke of that hostile people: Great
nobles and princes, accustomed to maintain an inde∣pendance
against their native sovereigns, would never en∣dure
a subjection to strangers: And tho' most of the prin∣ces
of the blood were, since the fatal battle of Azincour,
detained prisoners in England, the inhabitants of their
demesnes, their friends, their vassals, all declared a
<PB N="132" REF="142"/>
zealous attachment to the King, and exerted themselves
in resisting the violence of foreign invaders.</P>
<P>CHARLES himself, tho' only in his twentieth year,
was of a character well calculated to become the object
of these benevolent sentiments; and perhaps from the
favour, which naturally attends youth, was the more
likely, on account of his tender age, to acquire the
good-will of his native subjects. He was a prince of
the most friendly and benign disposition, of easy and fa∣miliar
manners, and of a just and sound, tho' not a very
vigorous understanding. Sincere, generous, affable, he
engaged from affection the services of his followers, even
while his low fortunes might make it their interest to desert
him; and the lenity of his temper could pardon in
them those sailles of discontent, to which princes in his
situation are so frequently exposed. The love of plea∣sure
often seduced him into indolence; but amidst all his
irregularities the goodness of his heart still shone forth;
and by exerting at intervals his courage and activity,
he proved, that his general remissness proceeded not from
the want, either of a just spirit of ambition, or of per∣sonal va<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our.</P>
<P>THO' the virtues of this amiable prince lay some time
in obscurity, the duke of Bedford knew, that his title
alone made him formidable, and that every foreign as∣sistance
would be requisite, ere an English regent could
hope to complete the conquest of France; an enterprize,
which, however it might seem to be much advanced,
was still exposed to many and great difficulties. The
chief circumstance, which had procured to the English
all their present advantages, was the resentment of the
duke of Burgundy against Charles; and as that prince
seemed intent rather in gratifying his passion than con∣sulting
his interests, it was the more easy for the regent,
by demonstrations of respect and confidence, to retain
<PB N="133" REF="143"/>
him in the alliance of England. He bent therefore all
his endeavours to that purpose: He gave the duke every
proof of friendship and regard: He even proffered him
the regency of France, which Philip declined: And that
he might corroborate national connexions by private ties,
he concluded his own marriage with the princess of Bur∣gundy,
which had been stipulated by the treaty of Arras.</P>
<P>BEING sensible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1423.</NOTE> that next to the alliance of Burgundy,
the friendship of the duke of Brittany was of the greatest
importance towards forwarding the English conquests;
and that, as the provinces of France, already subdued,
lay between the dominions of these two princes, he could
never hope for any security without preserving his con∣nexions
with them; he was very intent on strengthening
himself also from that quarter. The duke of Brittany,
having received many just reasons of displeasure from the
ministers of Charles, had already acceded to the treaty
of Troye, and had, with other vassals of the crown,
done homage to Henry V. in quality of heir to the king∣dom:
But as the regent knew, that the duke was much
governed by his brother, the count de Richemont, he
endeavoured to fix his friendship, by paying his court
and doing services to this haughty and ambitious prince.</P>
<P>ARTHUR, count de Richemont, had been taken pri∣soner
at the battle of Azincour, had been treated with
great indulgence by the late King, and had even been
permitted on his parole to take a journey into Brittany,
where the state of affairs required his presence.
The death of that victorious monarch happened before Riche∣mont's
return; and this prince pretended, that, as his
word was given personally to Henry V. he was not
bound to fulfil it towards his son and successor:<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th April.</NOTE> A
chicane which the regent, as he could not force him to
compliance, deemed it prudent to overlook. An inter∣view

<PB N="134" REF="146"/>
was settled at Amiens between the dukes of Bedford,
Burgundy, and Brittany, at which the count de Riche∣mont
was also present<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 84. Monstrelet, vol. i. p. 4. Stowe, p. 364.</NOTE>: The alliance was renewed
between these princes: And the regent persuaded Philip
to give in marriage to Richemont his eldest sister, widow
of the deceased Dauphin, Lewis, the elder brother of
Charles. Thus Arthur was connected both with the
regent and the duke of Burgundy, and seemed en∣gaged
by interest to prosecute the same object, in for∣warding
the progress of the English arms.</P>
<P>WHILE the vigilance of the duke of Bedford was em∣ployed
in gaining or confirming these allies, whose neigh∣bourhood
rendered them so important, he did not over∣look
the state of more remote countries. The duke of
Albany, regent of Scotland, had died; and his power
had devolved to Murdac, his son, a prince of a weak
understanding and of indolent dispositions; who, far
from possessing the talents requisite for the government of
that fierce people, was not even able to maintain autho∣rity
in his own family, or restrain the petulance and in∣solence
of his sons. The ardour of the Scots to serve in
France, where Charles treated them with great honour
and distiction, and where the regent's brother enjoyed
the dignity of constable, broke out afresh under this
feeble administration: New succours daily came over,
and filled the armies of the French King: The earl of
Douglas conducted a reinforcement of 5000 men to his
assistance. And it was justly to be dreaded, that the
Scots, by commencing open hostilities in the north,
would occasion a diversion still more considerable of the
English power, and would ease Charles, in part, of that
load, by which he was at present so grievously oppressed.
<PB N="135" REF="147"/>
The duke of Bedford, therefore, persuaded the English
council to form an alliance with James their prisoner; to
free that prince from his long captivity; and to con∣nect
him with England, by marrying him to a daugh∣ter
of the Earl of Somerset and cousin of the young
King<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 86. Stowe, p. 364. Grafton, p. 501.</NOTE>. As the Scots regent, tired of his present dig∣nity,
which he was not able to support, was now be∣come
entirely sincere in his applications for James's liberty,
the treaty was soon concluded; forty thousand pounds
of ransom were stipulated<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. x. p. 299, 300. 326.</NOTE>; and the King of Scots was
restored to the throne of his ancestors, and proved, in his
short reign, one of the most illustrious princes, who had
ever governed that kingdom. He was murdered in 1437
by his traiterous kinsman the earl of Athole. His affec∣tions
inclined him to the party of France; but the Eng∣lish
had never reason, during his life-time, to complain
of any breach of the neutrality by Scotland.</P>
<P>BUT the regent was not so employed in these political
negotiations as to neglect the operations of war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Military operations.</NOTE> from
which alone he could hope to succeed in expelling the
French monarch. Tho' the chief seat of Charles's power
lay in the southern provinces, on the other side of the
Loire; his partizans were possessed of some fortresses in the
northern, and even in the neighbourhood of Paris; and
it behoved the duke of Bedford first to clear these coun∣tries
of the enemy, before he could think of attempting
more distant conquests. The castle of Dorsoy was taken af∣ter
a siege of six weeks: That of Noyelle and the town of
Rüe in Picardy underwent the same fate: Pont sur Seine,
Vertus, Montaigu were subjected by the English arms:
And a more considerable advantage was soon after gained
<PB N="136" REF="148"/>
by the united forces of England and Burgundy. John
Stuart, constable of Scotland, and the lord d'Estissac had
formed the siege of Crevant in Burgundy: The earls of
Salisbury and Suffolk, with the count de Toulongeon,
were sent to its relief: A fierce and well disputed action
ensued; The Scots and French were defeated: The constable of Scotland and the count de Ventadour were
taken prisoners: And above a thousand men, among
whom was Sir William Hamilton, were left on the field
of battle<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 85. Monstrelet, vol. ii. p. 8. Holingshed, p. 586. Grafton, p. 500.</NOTE>. The taking of Gaillon upon the Seine, and
of la Charité upon the Loire was the fruit of this vic∣tory:
And as this latter place opened an entrance into
the southern provinces, the acquisition of it appeared on
that account of the greater importance to the duke of
Bedford, and seemed to promise a successful issue to the
war.</P>
<P>THE more King Charles was threatened with an in∣vasion
in those provinces which adhered to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1424.</NOTE> the
more necessary it became, that he should retain posses∣sion
of every fortress, which he still held within the
quarters of the enemy. The duke of Bedford had be∣sieged
in person, during the space of three months, the
town of Yvri in Normandy; and the brave governor,
unable to make any longer defence, was obliged to ca∣pitulate;
and he agreed to surrender the town, if, before
a certain term, no relief arrived to him. Charles, in∣formed
of these conditions, determined to make an at∣tempt
for saving the place. He collected, with some
difficulty, an army of 14,000 men, of whom the half
were Scots; and he sent them thither under the com∣mand
of the earl of Buchan, the constable of France;
who was attended by the earl of Douglas, his country∣man,
<PB N="137" REF="149"/>
the duke of Alençon, the mareschal de la Fayette,
the count d'Aumale, and the viscount de Narbonne.
When the constable arrived within a few leagues of
Yvri, he found that he was come too late, and that the
place was already surrendered. He immediately turned
to the left, and sat down before Verneüil, which the
inhabitants, in spite of the garrison, delivered up to him<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Monstrelet, vol. ii. p. 14. Grafton, p. 504.</NOTE>.
Buchan might now have returned in safety, and with the
glory of making an acquisition no less important than the
place, which he was sent to relieve: But hearing of
Bedford's approach, he called a council of war; and
asked their opinions with regard to the conduct which he
should follow in this emergence. The wiser part of the
council declared for a retreat; and represented, that all
the past misfortunes of the French had proceeded from
their rashness in giving battle, when no necessity obliged
them to risque a decisive action; that this army was the
last resource of the King, and the only defence of the
few provinces which remained to him; and that every
reason invited him to embrace cautious councils, which
left time for his subjects to return to their sense of duty,
and gave leisure for discord to arise among his enemies,
who, being united by no common band of interest or mo∣tive
of alliance, could not long persevere in their animo∣sity
against him. All these prudential considerations
were overborne by a vain point of honour, not to turn
their backs to the enemy; and they resolved to await
the arrival of the duke of Bedford.</P>
<P>THE numbers were nearly equal in this rencounter;<NOTE PLACE="marg">27th of August. Battle of Vernüil.</NOTE> and as the long continuance of the war had introduced
discipline, which, however imperfect, sufficed to main∣tain
some appearance of order in such small armies, the
battle was fierce, and well disputed, and attended with
<PB N="138" REF="150"/>
bloodshed on both sides. The constable drew up his
forces under the walls of Verneüil, and resolved to abide
the attack of the enemy: But the impatience of the vis∣count
of Narbonne, who broke his ranks, and obliged
the whole line to follow him in some hurry and confusion,
was the cause of the misfortune, which ensued. The
English archers, fixing their pali<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adoes before them, ac∣cording
to their usual custom, sent a volley of arrows
into the thickest of the French army; and tho' beat
from their ground, and obliged to take shelter among the
baggage, they soon rallied, and continued to commit
great slaughter upon the enemy. The duke of Bedford,
mean-while, at the head of the men at arms, made im∣pression
on the French, broke their ranks, chased them
off the field, and rendered the victory entirely compleat
and decisive<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 88, 89, 90. Monstrelet, vol. ii. p. 15. Stowe, p. 365. Hollingshed, p. 588.</NOTE>. The constable himself perished in
battle, the earl of Douglas and his son, the counts of
Aumale, Tonnerre and Ventadour, with many other
considerable nobility. The duke of Alençon, the ma∣reschal
de la Fayette, the lords of Gaucour and Morte∣mar
were taken prisoners. There fell about four thou∣sand
of the French; and sixteen hundred of the English;
a loss then esteemed so unusual on the side of the victors,
that the duke of Bedford prohibited all rejoicings for his
success. Verneuil was surrendered next day upon capi∣tulation<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Monstrelet, vol. ii. p. 15.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE condition of the King of France appeared now
very terrible, and almost desperate. He had lost the
flower of his army and the bravest of his nobles in this
fatal action: He had no resources for recruiting or sub∣sisting his troops: He wanted money even for his personal
subsistance; and tho' all parade of a court was banished,
it was with difficulty he could keep a table, supplied with
<PB N="139" REF="151"/>
the plainest necessaries, for himself and his few followers:
Every day brought him intelligence of some loss or mis∣fortune: Towns, which were bravely defended, were
obliged at last to surrender for want of relief or supply:
He saw his partizans entirely chaced from all the provin∣ces
which lay north of the Loire: And he expected soon
to lose, by the united efforts of his enemies, all the ter∣ritories,
of which he had hitherto continued master;
when an accident happened, which saved him on the
brink of ruin, and lost the English such an opportunity
for compleating their conquests, as they never afterwards
were able to recall.</P>
<P>JAQUELINE, countess of Hainault and Holland, and
heir of these provinces, had espoused John duke of Bra∣bant,
cousin german to the duke of Burgundy; but
having unhappily made this choice, from the usual mo∣tives
of princes, she soon found reason to repent her of
the unequal alliance. She was a princess of a masculine
spirit and uncommon understanding; the duke of Bra∣bant
was of a sickly complexion and weak mind: She
was in the vigour of her age; he had only reached his
fifteenth year: these causes had inspired her with such
contempt of her husband, which soon proceeded to anti∣pathy,
that she determined to break a marriage, where,
it is probable, nothing but the ceremony had as yet in∣tervened.
The court of Rome was commonly very open
to applications of this nature, when seconded by power
and money; but as the princess foresaw great opposi∣tion
from her husband's relations, and was impatient to
effect her purpose, she made her escape into England,
and threw herself under the protection of the duke of
Glocester. That prince, with many noble qualities, had
the defect of being governed by an impetuous temper
and vehement passions; and he was rashly induced, as
well by the charms of the countess herself, as by the
<PB N="140" REF="152"/>
prospect of possessing her rich inheritance, to offer him∣self
to her as a husband. Without waiting for a papal
dispensation; without endeavouring to reconcile the duke
of Burgundy to this measure; he entered into a con∣tract
of marriage with Jaqueline, and immediately at∣tempted
to put himself in possession of her dominions.
Philip was disgusted with so precipitant a conduct: He
resented the injury done to the duke of Brabant his near
relation: He dreaded to have the English established on
all sides of him: And he foresaw the consequences, which
must attend the extensive and uncontrouled dominion of
that nation, if, before the full settlement of their power,
they insulted and injured an ally, to whom they had al∣ready
been so much indebted, and who was so necessary
for supporting them in their farther progress. He en∣couraged,
therefore, the duke of Brabant to make re∣sistance:
He engaged many of Jaqueline's subjects to
adhere to that prince: He himself marched troops to his
support: And as the duke of Glocester still persevered
in his purpose, a sharp war was suddenly kindled in the
Low Countries. The quarrel soon became personal as
well as political. The English prince wrote to the duke
of Burgundy, complaining of the opposition made to his
pretensions; and tho' in the main, he employed amicable
terms in his letter, he took notice of some falshoods, into
which, he said, Philip had been betrayed during the
course of these transactions. This unguarded expression
was highly resented: The duke of Burgundy insisted,
that he should retract it: And mutual challenges and de∣fiances
passed between them on this occasion<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Monstrelet, vol. ii, p. 19, 20, 21.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Bedford could easily foresee the bad
effects of so ill-timed and imprudent a quarrel. All the
succours, which he expected from England, and which
were so necessary in this critical emergence, were inter∣cepted
<PB N="141" REF="153"/>
by his brother, and employed in Holland and
Hainault: The forces of the duke of Burgundy, which
he also depended on, were diverted by the same wars:
And besides this double loss, he was in imminent danger
of alienating for ever that confederate, whose friendship
was of the utmost importance to his interests, and whom
the late King had injoined him, with his dying breath,
to gratify by every mark of regard and attachment. He
inforced all these topics to the duke of Glocester: He en∣deavoured
to mitigate the resentment of the duke of Bur∣gundy:
He interposed with his good offices between
these princes: But he was not successful in any of his
endeavours; and he found, that the impetuosity of his
brother's temper was still the chief obstacle to all ac∣commodation<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Monstrelet, p. 18.</NOTE>. For this reason, instead of pushing the
victory gained at Verneüil, he found himself obliged to
take a journey into England, and to try, by his coun∣cils
and authority, to moderate the measures of the duke
of Glocester.</P>
<P>THERE had likewise broke out some differences among
the English ministry, which had proceeded to great ex∣tremities,
and which required the regent's presence to
compose them<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 368. Hollingshed, p. 590.</NOTE>. The bishop of Winchester, to whom
the care of the King's person and education had been
entrusted, was a prelate of great capacity and experi∣ence,
but of an intriguing and dangerous character; and
as he aspired to the government of affairs, he had conti∣nual
disputes with his nephew the protector, and he
gained frequent advantages over the vehement and impo∣litic
temper of that prince.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1425.</NOTE> The duke of Bedford em∣ployed
the authority of parliament to reconcile them;
and these rivals were obliged to promise before that as∣sembly,
<PB N="142" REF="154"/>
that they would bury all quarrels in oblivion<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 98, 99. Hollingshed, p. 593, 594. Polydore Virgil, p. 466. Grafton, p. 512, 519.</NOTE>.
Time also seemed to open expedients for composing the
difference with the duke of Burgundy. The credit of
that prince had procured a bull from the Pope; by which
not only Jaqueline's contract with the duke of Glocester
was annulled; but it was also declared, that even in case
of the duke of Brabant's death, it should never be law∣ful
for her to espouse the English prince. Humphrey,
despairing of success, married another lady of inferior
rank, who had lived some time with him, as his mistress<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 367.</NOTE>.
The duke of Brabant died; and his widow, before she
could recover possession of her dominions, was obliged
to declare the duke of Burgundy her heir, in case she
died without children, and to promise never to marry
any person without his consent. But tho' the affair was
thus terminated to the advantage of Philip, it left a dis∣agreeable
impression on his mind: It excited an extreme
jealousy of the English, and opened his eyes to his true
interests: And as nothing but his animosity against
Charles had engaged him in alliance with them, it coun∣terbalanced
that passion by another of the same kind,
which in the end became prevalent, and brought him
back, by degrees, to his natural connexions with his fa∣mily
and his native country.</P>
<P>ABOUT the same time, the duke of Brittany began to
withdraw himself from the English alliance. His bro∣ther,
the count de Richemont, tho' connected by mar∣riage
with the dukes of Burgundy and Bedford, was ex∣tremely
attached by inclination to the French interest;
and he willingly hearkened to all the advances which
Charles made him for obtaining his friendship. The
high office of constable, vacant by the earl of Buchan's
<PB N="143" REF="155"/>
death, was offered him; and as his martial and ambitious
temper aspired to the command of armies, which he
had in vain attempted to obtain from the duke of Bedford,
he not only accepted that trust, but brought over his
brother to an alliance with the French monarch. The
new constable, having made this one change in his
measures, firmly adhered ever after to his engagements
with France. Tho' his pride and violence, which would
admit of no rival in his master's confidence, and even
prompted him to assassinate the other favourites, had so
much disgusted Charles, that he once banished him the
court, and refused to admit him to his presence, he still
acted with vigour for the service of that monarch, and
obtained at last, by his perseverance, the pardon of all
his past offences.</P>
<P>IN this situation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1426.</NOTE> the duke of Bedford, on his return,
found the affairs of France, after passing eight months
in England. The duke of Burgundy was much disgusted.
The duke of Brittany had entered into engagements
with Charles, and had done homage to that prince for
his dutchy. The French had been allowed to recover
from the astonishment, into which their frequent disasters
had thrown them. An incident even happened, which
served extremely to raise their courage. The earl of
Warwic had besieged Montargis with a small army of 3000
men, and the place was reduced to extremity, when the
bastard of Orleans undertook to throw relief into it.
This general, who was natural son to the prince assas∣sinated
by the duke of Burgundy, and who was after∣wards
created count de Dunois, conducted a body of
1600 men to Montargis; and made an attack on the
enemy's trenches with so much valour, prudence, and
good fortune, that he not only penetrated into the place,
but gave a severe blow to the English, and obliged
<PB N="144" REF="156"/>
Warwic to raise the siege<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Monstrelet, vol. ii. p. 32, 33. Hollingshed, p. 597.</NOTE>. This was the first signal
action, which raised the same of Dunois, and opened
him the road to all those great honours, which he after∣wards
attained.</P>
<P>BUT the regent, soon after his arrival, revived the
credit of the English arms, by an important enterprize,
which he happily atchieved. He secretly brought to∣gether,
in separate detachments, a considerable army to the
frontiers of Brittany; and fell so unexpectedly upon that
province, that the duke, unable to make resistance,
yielded to all the terms required of him: He renounced
the French alliance; he engaged to maintain the treaty
of Troye; he acknowledged the duke of Bedford for
regent of France; and promised to do homage for his
dutchy to King Henry<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Monstrelet, vol. ii. p. 35, 36.</NOTE>. And the English prince, hav∣ing
thus freed himself from a dangerous enemy who lay
behind him, resolved on an undertaking, which, if suc∣cessful,
would, he hoped, cast the balance between the
two nations, and prepare the way for the final conquest
of France.</P>
<P>THE city of Orleans was so situated between the pro∣vinces
commanded by Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1428.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Siege of Orleans.</NOTE> and those possessed by
Charles, that it opened an easy entrance to either; and
as the duke of Bedford intended to make a great effort
to penetrate into the south of France, it behoved him to
begin with this place, which, in the present circumstan∣ces,
was become the most important in the kingdom. He
committed the conduct of the enterprize to the earl of
Salisbury, who had newly brought him over a reinforce∣ment
of 6000 men from England, and who had much
distinguished himself, by his abilities, during the course
of the present wars. Salisbury, passing the Loire, made
<PB N="145" REF="157"/>
himself master of several small places, which surrounded
Orleans on that side<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Monstrelet, vol. ii. p. 38, 39. Polyd. Virg. p. 468.</NOTE>; and as his intentions were there∣by
known, the French King used every expedient to sup∣ply
the city with a garrison and provisions, and enable
it to maintain a long and obstinate siege. The lord of
Gaucour, a brave and experienced captain, was appointed
governor: Many officers of distinction threw themselves
into the place: The troops, which they conducted, were
enured to war, and were determined to make the most
obstinate resistance: And even the inhabitants, disciplined
by the long continuance of hostilities, were well quali∣fied,
in their own defence, to second the efforts of the
most veteran forces. The eyes of all Europe were turned
towards this scene; where, it was reasonably supposed,
the French were to make their last stand for maintaining
the independance of their monarchy, and the rights of
their sovereign.</P>
<P>THE earl of Salisbury at last approached the place
with an army, which consisted only of 10,000 men;
and not being able, with so small a force, to invest so
great a city, that commanded a bridge over the Loire,
he stationed himself on the southern side towards So∣logne,
leaving the other, towards the Beausse, still open
to the enemy. He there attacked the fortifications,
which guarded the entry to the bridge; and after an
obstinate resistance, he carried several of them: But was
himself killed by a cannon ball as he was taking a view
of the enemy<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 105. Monstrelet, vol. ii. p. 39. Stowe, p. 369▪ Hollingshed, p. 599. Grafton, p. 531.</NOTE>. The earl of Suffolk succeeded to the
command; and being re-inforced with great numbers of English
and Burgundians, he passed the river with the
main body of his army, and invested Orleans on the
other side. As it was now the depth of winter, Suffolk,
<PB N="146" REF="158"/>
who found it difficult, in that season, to throw up in∣trenchments
all around, contented himself, for the pre∣sent,
with erecting redoubts at different distances, where
his men were lodged in safety, and were ready to inter∣cept
the supplies, which the enemy might attempt to
throw into the place. Tho' he had several pieces of
artillery in his camp, (and this is the first siege in Europe,
where cannon were found to be of importance) the art of
engineering was hitherto so imperfect, that Suffolk trusted
more to famine than force for subduing the city; and he
proposed in the spring to render the circumvallation more
compleat, by drawing intrenchments from one redoubt to
another. Numberless seats of valour were performed
both by the besiegers and besieged during this winter:
Bold sallies were made, and repulsed with equal bold∣ness:
Convoys were sometimes introduced and often
intercepted: The supplies were still unequal to the con∣sumption
of the place: And the English seemed daily,
tho' slowly, to be advancing towards the completion of their enterprize.</P>
<P>BUT while they lay in this situation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1429.</NOTE> the French
parties ravaged all the country around; and the besieg∣ers,
who were obliged to draw their provisions from a
distance, were themselves exposed to the danger of
want and famine. Sir John Fastolffe was bringing up a
large convoy, of every kind of stores, which he escorted
with a detachment of 2,500 men; when he was at∣tacked
by a body of 4000 French, under the command
of the counts of Clermont and Dunois. Fastolffe drew
up behind his waggons; but the French generals, cau∣tious
of attacking him in that posture, planted a battery
of cannon against him, which threw every thing into
confusion, and would have ensured them the victory;
had not the impatience of some Scots troops, who
<PB N="147" REF="159"/>
broke the line of battle, brought on an engagement, in
which Fastolffe was victorious. The count de Dunois
was wounded; and above 500 French were left on the
field of battle. This action, which was of great im∣portance
in the present conjuncture, was commonly call∣ed
the battle of <HI>Herrings;</HI> because the convoy brought
a great quantity of that kind of provisions, for the use
of the English army during the Lent season<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 106. Monstrelet, vol. ii. p. 41, 42. Stowe, p. 369▪ Hollingshed, p. 600. Polyd. Virg. p. 469. Grafton, p. 532.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CHARLES seemed now to have but one expedient for
saving this city, which had been so long invested. The
duke of Orleans, who was still prisoner in England,
prevailed on the protector and the council to consent,
that all his demesnes should be allowed to preserve a neu∣trality
during the war, and should be sequestered, for
greater security, into the hands of the duke of Burgundy.
This prince, who was much less cordial in the English
interests than formerly, went to Paris, and made the pro∣posal
to the duke of Bedford; but the regent replied
very coldly, that he was not of a humour to beat the
bushes, while others ran away with the game: An an∣swer,
which so much disgusted the duke, that he recalled
all the troops of Burgundy, that acted in the siege<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 106. Monstrelet, vol. ii. p. 42. Stowe, p. 369. Grafton, p. 533.</NOTE>.
The place, however, was every day more and more closely
invested by the English: Great scarcity began already to
be felt by the garrison and inhabitants: Charles, in
despair of collecting an army, which should dare to ap∣proach
the enemy's entrenchments, not only gave the city
for lost, but began to entertain a very dismal prospect
with regard to the general state of his affairs. He saw
that the country, in which he had hitherto, with great
difficulty, subsisted, would be laid entirely open to the
<PB N="148" REF="160"/>
invasion of a powerful and victorious enemy; and he
talked already of retiring with the remains of his forces
into Languedoc and Dauphiny, and of defending himself
as long as possible in those distant provinces. But it
was fortunate for this good prince, that he lay under the
dominion of women; and that the women, whom he
consulted, had the spirit to support his sinking resolutions
in this desperate extremity. Mary of Anjou, his Queen,
a princess of great merit and prudence, vehemently op∣posed
this measure, which, she foresaw, would discou∣rage
all his partizans, and serve as a general signal for
deserting a prince, who seemed himself to despair of suc∣cess.
His mistress too, the fair Agnes Sorel, who lived
in entire amity with the Queen, seconded all her remon∣strances,
and threatened, that, if he thus pusillanimous<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y
threw away the scepter of France, she would seek in the
court of England a fortune more correspondent to her wishes.
Love was able to rouze in the breast of Charles
that courage, which ambition had failed to excite: He
resolved to dispute every inch of ground with ant imperi∣ous
enemy; and rather to perish with honour in the
midst of his friends than yield ingloriously to his bad for∣tune:
When relief was unexpectedly brought him by
another female of a very different character, who gave
rise to one of the most singular revolutions, that is to be
met with in history.</P>
<P>IN the village of Domremi near Vaucouleurs, on the
borders of Lorraine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The maid of Orleans.</NOTE> there lived a country girl of twenty∣seven
years of age, called Joan d'Arc, who was servant
in a small inn, and who in that station had been ac∣customed
to tend the horses of the guests, to ride them
without a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>addle to the watering-place, and to perform
other offices, which, in well-frequented inns, commonly
fall to the share of the men servants<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 107. Monstrelet, vol. ii. p. 42. Grafton, p. 534.</NOTE>. This girl was of
<PB N="149" REF="161"/>
an irreproachable life, and had not hitherto been remark∣ed
for any singularity; whether that she had met with
no occasion to excite her genius, or that the unskilful
eyes of those, who conversed with her, had not been
able to discern her uncommon merit. It is easy to ima∣gine,
that the present situation of France was an in∣teresting
object even to persons of the lowest rank, and
would become the frequent subject of their conversation:
A young prince, expelled his native throne, by the se∣dition
of subjects and by the arms of strangers, could
not fail to move the compassion of all his people, whose
hearts were uncorrupted by faction; and the peculiar
character of Charles, so strongly inclined to friendship
and the tender passions, naturally rendered him the hero
of that sex, whose generous minds know no bounds in
their affections. The siege of Orleans, the progress of
the English before that place, the great distress of the
garrison and inhabitants, the importance of saving this
city and its brave defenders, had turned thither the eyes
of all the world; and Joan, inflamed by the general
sentiment, was seized with a wild desire of bringing relief
to her sovereign in his present distresses. Her unexperi∣enced
mind, working day and night on this favourite
object, mistook the impulses of her passion for heavenly
inspirations; and she fancied, that she saw visions, and
heard voices, exhorting her to re-establish the throne of
France, and to expel the foreign invaders. An uncom∣mon
intrepidity of temper made her overlook all the
dangers, which might attend her in such a path; and
thinking herself destined by heaven to this office, she
threw aside that bashfulness and timidity, which would
naturally adhere to her sex, her years, and her low ssta∣tion.
She went to Vaucouleurs; procured admission to
Baudricourt, the governor; informed him of her inspira∣tions
and intentions; and conjured him not to neglect
<PB N="150" REF="162"/>
the voice of God, who spoke thro' her, but to second
those heavenly revelations, which impelled her to this
glorious enterprize. Baudricourt treated her at first with
some neglect; but on her frequent returns to him, and
importunate solicitations, he began to remark something
extraordinary in the maid, and was inclined, at all ha∣zards,
to make so easy an experiment. It is uncertain,
whether this gentleman had discernment enough to per∣ceive,
that great use might be made with the vulgar
of so uncommon an engine; or, what is more likely
in that credulous age, was himself a convert to this
visionary: But he adopted at last the scheme of Joan;
and he gave her some attendants, who conducted her
to the French court, which at that time resided at
Chinon.</P>
<P>IT is the business of history to distinguish between the
<HI>mira<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulous</HI> and the <HI>marvellous;</HI> to reject the first in all
narrations merely profane and human; to scruple the
second; and when obliged by undoubted testimony, as
in the present case, to admit of something extraordinary,
to receive as little of it as is consistent with the known
facts and circumstances. It is pretended, that Joan, im∣mediately
on her admission, knew the King, tho' she
had never seen his face before, and tho' he purposely
kept himself in the crowd of courtiers, and had laid
aside every thing in his dress and apparel, which might
distinguish him: That she offered him, in the name of
the supreme Creator, to raise the siege of Orleans, and
conduct him to Rheims to be there crowned and anoint∣ed;
and on his expressing some doubts of her mission,
revealed to him, before some sworn confidents, a secret,
which was unknown to all the world but himself, and
which nothing but a heavenly inspiration could discover
to her: And that she demanded, as the instrument of
her future victories, a particular sword, which was kept
<PB N="151" REF="163"/>
in the church of St. Catharine de Fierbois, and which,
tho' she had never seen it, she described by all its marks,
and by the place in which it had long been laid and ne∣glected<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 107. Hollingshed, p. 600.</NOTE>. This is certain, that all these miraculous
stories were spread abroad, in order to catch the vulgar.
The more the King and his ministers were determined
to give into the illusion, the more scruples they pre∣tended.
An assembly of grave doctors and theologians
cautiously examined Joan's mission, and pronounced it
undoubted and supernatural. She was sent to the par∣liament,
then residing at Poictiers; and was interro∣gated
before that assembly: The presidents, the coun∣sellors
who came persuaded of her imposture, went
away convinced of her inspiration. A ray of hope be∣gan
to break thro' that despair, in which the minds of
all men were before enveloped. Heaven had now de∣clared
itself in favour of France, and had laid bare its
out-stretched arm to take vengeance on her invaders.
Few could distinguish between the impulse of inclination
and the force of conviction; and none would submit to
the trouble of so disagreeable a scrutiny.</P>
<P>AFTER these artificial precautions and preparations
had been for some time employed, Joan's requests were at
last complied with: She was armed cap-a-pee, mounted
on horseback, and shown in that martial habiliment be∣fore
the whole people. Her dexterity in managing her
steed, tho' acquired in her former occupation, was re∣garded
as a new proof of her mission; and she was re∣ceived
with the loudest acclamations by the spectators.
Her former occupation was even denied: She was no
longer the servant of an inn. She was converted into a
shepherdess, an employment much more agreeable to
the imagination. To render her still more interesting,
<PB N="152" REF="164"/>
near ten years were subtracted from her age; and all
the sentiments of love and of chivalry, were thus united to
those of enthusiasm, in order to inflame the fond fancy
of the people with prepossessions in her favour.</P>
<P>WHEN the engine was thus dressed up in full splen∣dor,
it was time to essay its force against the enemy,
Joan was sent to Blois, where a large convoy was pre∣pared
for the supply of Orleans, and an army of ten
thousand men, under the command of St. Severe, assem∣bled
to escort it. She ordered all the soldiers to confess
themselves before they set out on the enterprize: She ba∣nished
from the camp all women of bad fame: She dis∣played
in her hands a consecrated banner; where the Su∣preme
Being was represented, grasping the globe of earth,
and surrounded with flower de luces. And she insisted,
in right of her prophetic mission, that the convoy should
enter Orleans, by the direct road from the side of
Beausse; but the count de Dunois, unwilling to submit
the rules of the military art to her inspirations, ordered
it to approach by the other side of the river, where, he
knew, the weakest part of the English army was sta∣tioned.</P>
<P>PREVIOUS to this attempt, the maid had wrote to the
regent and to the English generals before Orleans, com∣manding
them, in the name of the omnipotent Creator,
by whom she was commissioned, immediately to raise
the siege and to evacuate France; and menacing them
with divine vengeance in case of their disobedience. All
the English affected to speak with derision of the maid
and of her heavenly commission; and said, that the
French King was now indeed reduced to a sorry pass,
when he had recourse to such ridiculous expedients: But
they felt their imagination secretly struck with the
vehement persuasion, which prevailed in all around
them; and they waited with an anxious expectation,
<PB N="153" REF="165"/>
not unmixed with horror, for the issue of these extra∣ordinary
preparations.</P>
<P>As the convoy approached the river, a sally was made
by the garrison on the side of Beausse, to prevent the
English general from sending any detachment to the
other side:<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th April.</NOTE> The provisions were peaceably embarked in
boats, which the inhabitants of Orleans had sent to re∣ceive
them: The maid covered with her troops the em∣barkation:
Suffolk ventured not to attack her: And the
French general carried back the army in safety to Blois;
an alteration of affairs, which was already visible to all
the world, and which had a proportional effect on the
minds of both parties.</P>
<P>THE maid entered the town of Orleans, arrayed in
her military garb, and displaying her consecrated stand∣ard;
and was received, as a celestial deliverer, by all
the inhabitants. They now believed themselves invincible
under her sacred influence; and Dunois himself, per∣ceiving
such a mighty alteration both in friends and foes,
consented, that the next convoy, which was expected in
a few days, should enter by the side of Beausse. The
convoy approached:<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th May.</NOTE> No sign of resistance appeared in
the besiegers: The waggons and troops passed without
interruption between the redoubts of the English: A dead
silence and astonishment reigned among those troops,
formerly so elated with victory, and so fierce for the
combat.</P>
<P>THE earl of Suffolk was in a situation very unusual
and extraordinary; and which might well confound the
man of the greatest capacity and firmest temper. He
saw his troops overawed, and strongly impressed with the
idea of a divine influence, accompanying the maid. In∣stead
of banishing these vain terrors by hurry and action
and war, he waited till the soldiers should recover from
the panic; and he thereby gave leisure for these prepos∣sessions
<PB N="154" REF="166"/>
to sink still deeper into their minds. The mili∣tary
maxims, which are prudent in common cases, de∣ceived
him in these unaccountable events. The English
felt their courage daunted and overwhelmed; and thence
inferred a divine vengeance hanging over them. The
French drew the same inference from an inactivity so
new and unexpected. Every circumstance was now re∣versed
in the opinions of men, on which all depends:
The spirit, resulting from a long course of uninterrupted
success, was on a sudden transferred from the victors to
the vanquished.</P>
<P>THE maid called aloud, that the garrison should re∣main
no longer on the defensive; and she promised her
followers the assistance of heaven in attacking those re∣doubts
of the enemy, which had so long kept them in
awe, and which they had never hitherto dared to insult.
The generals seconded her ardour: An attack was made
on one redoubt, and it proved successful<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Monstrelet, vol. ii. p. 45.</NOTE>: All the English,
who defended the entrenchments, were put to the sword
or taken prisoners: And Sir John Talbot himself, who
had drawn together, from the other redoubts, some
troops to bring them relief, dared not to appear in the
open field against so formidable an enemy.</P>
<P>NOTHING seemed impossible after this success to the
Maid and her enthusiastic votaries. She urged the ge∣nerals
to attack the main body of the English in their
entrenchments: But Dunois, still unwilling to hazard
the fate of France by too great temerity, and sensible
that the least reverse of fortune would make all the pre∣sent
visions evaporate, and restore every thing to its
former condition, checked her vehemence, and proposed
to her first to expel the enemy from their forts on the
other side of the river, and thus lay the communication
<PB N="155" REF="167"/>
with the country entirely open, before she attempted any
more hazardous enterprize. Joan was persuaded, and
these forts were vigorously assailed. In one attack the
French were repulsed; the maid was left almost alone; she
was obliged to retreat, and join the runaways; but dis∣playing
her sacred standard, and animating them with her
countenance, her gestures, her exhortations, she led
them back to the charge, and overpowered the English
in their entrenchments. In the attack of another fort, she
was wounded in the neck with an arrow; she retreated
a moment behind the assailants; she pulled out the arrow
with her own hands; she had the wound quickly dressed;
and she hastened back to head the troops, and to plant
her victorious banner on the ramparts of the enemy.</P>
<P>BY all these successes, the English were entirely chaced
from their fortifications on that side: They had lost above
six thousand men in these different actions; and what
was still more important, their wonted courage and con∣fidence
was wholly gone, and had given place to amaze∣ment
and despair. The Maid returned triumphant over
the bridge, and was again received as the guardian angel
of the city. After performing such miracles, she con∣vinced
the most obdurate incredulity of her divine mis∣sion:
Men felt themselves animated as by a superior
energy, and thought nothing impossible to that divine
hand, which so visibly conducted them. It was in vain
even for the English generals to oppose with their soldiers
the prevailing opinion of supernatural influence: They
themselves were probably moved with the same belief:
The utmost they dared to advance, was, that Joan was
not an instrument of God; she was only the implement
of the Devil: But as the English had felt, to their sad
experience, that the Devil might be allowed sometimes
to prevail, they derived not much consolation from the
enforcing of this opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="168"/>
IT might prove extremely dangerous for Suffolk, with
such intimidated troops, to remain any longer in the
presence of such a courageous and victorious enemy; and
he therefore raised the siege,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The siege of Orleans raised.</NOTE> and retreated with all the
precautions imaginable. The French resolved to push
their conquests,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th May.</NOTE> and to allow the English no leisure to
recover from their consternation. Charles formed a
body of six thousand men, and sent them to attack Jer∣geau,
whither Suffolk had retired with a detachment of
his army. The siege lasted ten days; and the place
was obstinately defended. Joan displayed her wonted
intrepidity on this occasion. She descended into the
fossee, in leading the attack; and she there received a
blow on the head with a stone, by which she was con∣founded
and beat to the ground: But she soon recovered
herself; and in the end rendered the assault successful:
Suffolk was obliged to yield himself prisoner to a French∣man
called Renaud; but before he submitted, he asked
his adversary, whether he was a gentleman. On receiv∣ing
a satisfactory answer, he demanded, whether he was
a knight. Renaud replied, that he had not yet attained
that honour. <HI>Then I make you one,</HI> replied Suffolk: Upon
which, he gave him the blow with his sword, which
dubbed him into that fraternity; and he immediately
surrendered himself his prisoner.</P>
<P>THE remainder of the English army was commanded
by Fastolffe, Scales and Talbot, who thought of nothing
but of making their retreat, as soon as possible, into a
place of safety; while the French esteemed the overtaking
them equivalent to a victory. So much had the events,
which passed before Orleans, altered every thing between
the two nations! The vanguard of the French under
Xaintrailles attacked the rear of the enemy at the village
of Patay.<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th June.</NOTE> The battle lasted not a moment: The Eng∣lish
were discomfited and fled: The brave Fastolffe him∣self
<PB N="157" REF="169"/>
showed the example of flight to his troops; and the
order of the garter was taken from him, as a punish∣ment
for this instance of cowardice<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Monstrelet, vol. ii. p. 46.</NOTE>. Two thousand
men were killed in this action; and both Talbot and
Scales taken prisoners.</P>
<P>IN the account of all these successes, the French
writers, to magnify the wonder, represent the maid
(who was now known by the appellation of <HI>the Maid
of Orleans</HI>) as not only active in the combats, but as per∣forming
the office of general; directing the troops, con∣ducting
the military operations, and swaying the delibe∣rations
in all councils of war. It is certain, that the
policy of the French court endeavoured to maintain this
appearance with the public: But it is much more pro∣bable,
that Dunois and the wiser commanders prompted
her in all her measures, than that a country girl, with∣out
experience or education, could, on a sudden, be∣come
expert in a profession, which requires more genius
and capacity, than any other active scene of life. It is suf∣ficient
praise, that she could distinguish the persons on
whose judgment she might rely; that she could seize
their hints and suggestions, and, on a sudden, deliver
their opinion as her own; and that she could curb, on
occasion, that visionary and enthusiastic spirit, with which
she was undoubtedly actuated, and could temper it with
prudence and discretion.</P>
<P>THE raising of the siege of Orleans was one part of
the maid's promise to Charles: The crowning him at
Rheims was the other: And she now insisted vehemently,
that he should forthwith set out on that enterprize. A
few weeks before, such a proposal would have appeared
the most extravagant in the world. Rheims lay in a
distant quarter of the kingdom; was then in the hands
<PB N="158" REF="170"/>
of a victorious enemy; the whole road, which led to it,
was occupied by their garrisons; and no imagination
could be so sanguine as to think, that such an attempt
could so soon come within the bounds of possibility.
But as it was extremely the interest of Charles to main∣tain
the belief of something extraordinary and divine in
these events, and to avail himself of the present conster∣nation
of the English; he resolved to follow the exhor∣tations
of his warlike prophetess, and to lead his army
upon this promising adventure. Hitherto, he had kept
remote from the scene of war: As the safety of the state
depended entirely upon his person, he had been per∣suaded
to restrain his military ardour: But observing this
prosperous turn of affairs, he now determined to appear
at the head of his armies, and to set the example of va∣lour
to all his soldiers. And the French nobility saw
at once their young sovereign assuming a new and more
brilliant character, seconded by fortune, and conducted
by the hand of heaven; and they caught fresh zeal to
exert themselves in replacing him on the throne of his
ancestors.</P>
<P>CHARLES set out for Rheims at the head of twelve
thousand men:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of France crowned at Rheims.</NOTE> He passed by Troye, which opened its
gates to him: Chalons imitated the example: Rheims
sent him a deputation with its keys, before his approach
to it: And he scarce perceived, as he passed along, that
he was marching thro' an enemy's country. The cere∣mony
of his coronation was here performed<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Monstrelet, vol. ii. p. 48.</NOTE> with the
holy oil,<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th July.</NOTE> which a pigeon had brought to King Clovis
from heaven, on the first establishment of the French
monarchy: The maid of Orleans stood by his side, in
compleat armour, and displaying her sacred banner,
which had so often dissipated and confounded his fiercest
<PB N="159" REF="171"/>
enemies: And the people shouted with the most unfeign∣ed
joy, on viewing such a complication of wonders.
After the completion of the ceremony, the Maid threw
herself at the King's feet, embraced his knees, and with
a flood of tears, which pleasure and tenderness extorted
from her, she congratulated him on this singular and
marvellous event.</P>
<P>CHARLES, thus crowned and anointed, became more
venerable in the eyes of all his subjects, and seemed,
in a manner, to receive anew, from a heavenly commis∣sion,
his title to their allegiance. The inclinations of
men swaying their belief, no one doubted of the inspira∣tions
and prophetic spirit of the Maid: So many inci∣dents,
which passed all human comprehension, left little
room to question a superior influence: And the real and
undoubted facts gave credit to every exaggeration, which
could scarce be rendered more wonderful. Laon, Sois∣sons,
Chateau-Thierri, Provins, and many other towns
and fortresses in that neighbourhood, immediately after
Charles's coronation, submitted to him on the first sum∣mons;
and the whole nation was disposed to give him
the most zealous testimonies of their duty and affection.</P>
<P>NOTHING can impress us with a higher idea of the
wisdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prudence of the duke of Bedford.</NOTE> address, and resolution of the duke of Bedford,
than his being able to maintain himself in so perilous a
situation, and to preserve some footing in France, after
the defection of so many places, and amidst the univer∣sal
inclination of the rest to imitate that contagious
example. This prince seemed present every where by
his vigilance and foresight: He employed each resource,
which fortune had yet left him: He held all the Eng∣lish
garrisons in a posture of defence: He kept a watch∣ful
eye over every attempt among the French towards
an insurrection: He retained the Parisians in obedience,
by employing alternately caresses and severity: And
<PB N="160" REF="172"/>
knowing that the duke of Burgundy was already wa∣vering
in his fidelity, he acted with so much skill and
prudence, as to renew, in this dangerous crisis, an al∣liance,
which was so important to the credit and support
of the English government.</P>
<P>THE small supplies which he received from England
set the talents of this great man in still a stronger light.
The ardour of the English for foreign conquests was now
extremely abated by time and reflection: The parliament
seems even to have become sensible of the danger, which
might attend their farther progress: No supply of money
could be obtained by the regent during his greatest dis∣tresses;
and men inlisted slowly under his standard, or
soon deserted, by reason of the wonderful accounts,
which had reached England, of the magic, and sorcery,
and diabolical power of the maid of Orleans<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. x. p. 459. 472.</NOTE>. It hap∣pened
fortunately, in this emergency, that the bishop
of Winchester, now created a cardinal, landed at Calais
with a body of 5000 men, which he was conducting into
Bohemia, on<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> crusade against the Hussites. He was per∣suaded
to lend these troops to his nephew during the pre∣sent
difficulties<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. x. p. 421.</NOTE>; and the regent was thereby enabled to
take the field, and to oppose the French King, who was
advancing with his army to the gates of Paris.</P>
<P>THE extraordinary capacity of the duke of Bedford
appeared also in his military operations. He attempted
to restore the courage of his troops by boldly advancing
to the face of the enemy; but he chose his posts with so
much caution, as always to decline a combat, and to
render it impossible for Charles to attack him. He still
attended that prince in all his movements; covered his
own towns and garrisons; and kept himself in a posture
to reap advantage from every imprudence or false step of
<PB N="161" REF="173"/>
the enemy. The French army, which consisted mostly
of volunteers, who served at their own expence, soon
after retired and was dissolved: Charles went to Bourges,
the ordinary place of his residence; but not till he made
himself master of Compiegne, Beauvais, Senlis, Sens,
Laval, Lagni, St. Denis, and of many places in the
neighbourhood of Paris, which the affections of the
people had put into his hands.</P>
<P>THE regent endeavoured to revive the declining state
of his affairs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1430.</NOTE> by bringing over the young King of Eng∣land,
and having him crowned and acknowledged King
of France at Paris<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. x. p. 432.</NOTE>. All the vassals of the crown, who
lived within the provinces possessed by the English, swore
anew allegiance and did homage to him. But this cere∣mony
was cold and insipid in comparison of the eclat
which had attended the coronation of Charles at Rheims;
and the duke of Bedford expected more effect from an
accident, which put into his hands the person, who had
been the author of all his calamities.</P>
<P>THE maid of Orleans, after the coronation of Charles,
declared to the count de Dunois, that her wishes were
now satisfied, and that she had no farther desire than to
return to her former condition, and to the occupations
and course of life, which became her sex: But that
nobleman, sensible of the mighty advantages, which
might still be reaped from her presence in the army, ex∣horted
her to persevere, till, by the final expulsion of
the English, she had brought all her prophecies to their
full completion. In pursuance of this advice, she threw
herself into the town of Compiegne, which was at that
time besieged by the duke of Burgundy, assisted by the
earls of Arundel and Suffolk; and the garrison on her
<PB N="162" REF="174"/>
appearance believed themselves thenceforth invincible.
But their joy was of short duration. The Maid, next
day after her arrival, headed a sally upon the quarters of
John de Luxembourg;<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th May.</NOTE> she twice drove the enemy from
their entrenchments; finding their numbers to encrease
every moment, she ordered a retreat; when hard pressed
by the pursuers, she turned upon them, and made them
again recoil; but being here deserted by her friends, and
surrounded by the enemy, she was at last, after exerting
the utmost valour, taken prisoner by the Burgundians<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 371.</NOTE>.
The common opinion was, that the French officers,
finding the merit of every victory ascribed to her, had,
in envy to her renown, by which they themselves were
so much eclipsed, willingly exposed her to this fatal
accident.</P>
<P>THE envy of her friends on this occasion was not a
greater proof of her merit than the triumph of her ene∣mies.
A complete victory would not have given more
joy to the English and their partizans. The service of
<HI>Te Deum,</HI> which has so often been prophaned by princes,
was publicly celebrated on this fortunate event at Paris.
The duke of Bedford fancied, that, by the captivity of
that extraordinary woman, who had blasted all his suc∣cesses,
he would again recover his former ascendant over
France; and to push farther the present advantage, he
purchased the captive from John de Luxembourg, and
formed a prosecution against her, which, whether it pro∣ceeded
from vengeance or policy, was equally barbarous,
and dishonourable.</P>
<P>THERE was no possible reason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1431.</NOTE> why Joan should not
be regarded as a prisoner of war, and be entitled to all
the courtesy and good usage, which civilized nations
<PB N="163" REF="175"/>
practise towards enemies on these occasions. She had
never, in her military capacity, forfeited, by any act of
treachery or cruelty, her claim to that treatment: She
was unstained with any civil crime: Even the virtues
and the very decorums of her sex had ever been rigidly
observed by her<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">We learn from her trial in Pasquier, that when accused of having put to death Franquet d' Arras her prisoner, she justified herself by say∣ing, that he was a known robber, and lay under sentence of death by a civil magistrate. She was so careful of observing decorums, that, when she was in any town or garrison, she always went to bed with some women of character in the place: When in the camp, she lay in armour, and always had one of her brothers on each side of her. The English never reproached her with any thing in regard to her morals.</NOTE>: And tho' her appearing in war, and
leading armies to battle, may seem an exception, she had
thereby performed such signal service to her prince, that
she had abundantly compensated for this irregularity;
and was even, on that very account, the more an object
of praise and admiration. It was necessary, therefore,
for the duke of Bedford to interest religion some way in
the prosecution; and to cover under that cloak his fla∣grant
violation of justice and humanity.</P>
<P>THE bishop of Beauvais, a man wholly devoted to the
English interest, presented a petition against Joan, on
pretence, that she was taken within the bounds of his
diocese, and he desired to have her tried by an ecclesias∣tical
court for sorcery, impiety, idolatry and magic:
The university of Paris was so mean as to join in the
same request: Several prelates, among whom the car∣dinal
of Winchester was the only Englishman, were ap∣pointed
her judges: They held their court in Roüen,
where the young King of England then resided: And
the Maid, cloathed in her former military apparel, but
loaded with irons, was produced before this tribunal.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="176"/>
SHE first desired to be eased of her chains: Her judges
answered that she had once already attempted an escape
by throwing herself from a tower: She confessed the
fact, maintained the justice of her intention, and owned,
that, if she could, she would still execute that purpose.
All her other speeches showed the same firmness and in∣trepidity:
Tho' harrassed with interrogatories, during
near the course of four months, she never betrayed any
weakness or womanish submission; and no advantage
was gained over her. The point, which her judges
pushed most vehemently, was her visions and revelations
and intercourse with departed saints; and they asked her,
whether she would submit to the church the truth of
these inspirations: She replied, that she would submit
them to God, the fountain of truth. They then ex∣claimed,
that she was a heretic, and denied the autho∣rity
of the church. She appealed to the Pope: They re∣jected
her appeal.</P>
<P>THEY asked her, why she put trust in her standard
which had been consecrated by magical incantations:
She replied, that she put trust in the Supreme Being
alone, whose image was impressed upon it. They de∣manded,
why she carried in her hand that standard at
the anointment and coronation of Charles at Rheims:
She answered, that the person, who had shared the dan∣ger,
was entitled to share the glory. When accused of
going to war contrary to the decorums of her sex, and
of assuming government and command over men; she
scrupled not to reply, that her sole purpose was to defeat
the English, and to expel them from the kingdom of
France. In the issue, she was condemned for all the
crimes of which she had been accused, aggravated by he∣resy;
her revelations were declared to be inventions of the
devil to delude the people; and she was sentenced to be
delivered over to the secular arm.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="177"/>
JOAN, so long surrounded by inveterate enemies, who
treated her with every mark of contumely; brow-beaten
and overawed by men of superior rank, and men invested
with the ensigns of a sacred character, which she had
been accustomed to revere; felt her spirit at last subdued,
and those visionary dreams of inspiration, in which she
had been buoyed up by the triumphs of success and the
applauses of her own party, gave way to the terrors of
that punishment to which she was sentenced. She pub∣licly
declared herself willing to recant; she acknowledged
the illusion of those revelations which the church had re∣jected;
and she promised never more to maintain them.
Her sentence was then mitigated: She was condemned
to perpetual imprisonment, and to be fed during life on
bread and water.</P>
<P>ENOUGH was now done to fulfil all political views,
and to convince both the French and the English, that
the opinion of divine influence, which had so much en∣couraged
the one and daunted the other, was entirely
without foundation. But the barbarous vengeance of
Joan's enemies was not satisfied with this victory. Sus∣pecting,
that the female dress, which she had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow con∣sented
to wear, was disagreeable to her, they purposely
placed in her apartment a suit of men's apparel; and
watched for the effect of that temptation upon her. On
the sight of a dress, in which she had acquired so much
renown, and which she once believed, she wore by the
particular appointment of heaven, all her former ideas
and passions revived; and she ventured in her solitude to
cloath herself again in the forbidden garment. Her in∣sidious
enemies caught her in that situation: Her fault
was interpreted to be no less than a relapse into heresy:
No recantation would now suffice, and no pardon could
be granted her. She was condemned to be burned in
the market-place of Roüen; and the infamous sentence
<PB N="166" REF="178"/>
was accordingly executed. This admirable heroine, to
whom the more generous superstition of the antients
would have erected alters, was, on pretence of heresy and
magic,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution of the maid of Orleans.</NOTE> delivered over alive to the flames, and expiated
by that dreadful punishment the signal services, which
she had rendered to her prince and to her native country.<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th June.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE affairs of the English,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1432.</NOTE> far from being advanced by
this execution, went every day more and more to decay:
The great abilities of the regent were unable to resist the
strong inclination, which had seized the French to return
under the obedience of their rightful sovereign, and
which that act of cruelty was ill fitted to remove.
Chartres was surprized by a stratagem of the count de
Dunois: A body of the English, under lord Willoughby,
was defeated at St. Celerin upon the Sarte<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Monstrelet, vol. ii. p. 100.</NOTE>: The fair
in the suburbs of Caën, seated in the midst of the English
territories, was pillaged by de Lore, a French captain
of reputation: The duke of Bedford himself was obliged
by Dunois to raise the siege of Lagni with some dis∣honour:
And all these misfortunes, tho' light, yet be∣ing
continued and uninterrupted, brought discredit to
the English, and menaced them with an approaching loss
of all their conquests. But the chief detriment, which
the regent sustained, was by the death of his dutchess,
who had hitherto preserved some appearance of friendship
between him and her brother, the duke of Burgundy<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. ii. p. 87.</NOTE>:
And his marriage soon afterwards, with Jaqueline of
Luxembourg, was the beginning of a breach between
them<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 373. Grafton, p. 554.</NOTE>. Philip complained, that the regent had never
had the civility to inform him of his intentions, and
that so sudden a marriage was a slight on his sister's me∣mory.
The cardinal of Winchester mediated a recon∣ciliation
<PB N="167" REF="179"/>
between these princes, and brought them both
to St. Omers for that purpose. The duke of Bedford
here expected the first visit both as he was son, brother,
and uncle to a King, and because he had already made
such advances as to come into the duke of Burgundy's
territories, in order to have an interview with him: But
Philip, proud of his great power and independant domi∣nions,
refused to pay this compliment to the regent: And
the two princes, unable to adjust the ceremonial, parted
without seeing each other<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Monstrelet, vol. ii. p. 90. Grafton, p. 561.</NOTE>. A very bad prognostic of
their cordial intentions to renew past friendship and
amity!</P>
<P>NOTHING could be more repugnant to the interests of
the house of Burgun∣dy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Defection of the duke of Burgundy.</NOTE> than to unite the crowns of
France and England on the same head; an event, which,
had it taken place, would have reduced the duke to the
rank of a petty prince, and have rendered his situation
entirely dependant and precarious. The title also to the
crown of France, which, after the failure of the elder
branches, might accrue to the duke or his posterity, had
been sacrificed by the treaty of Troye; and strangers
and enemies were thereby irrevocably fixed upon the
throne. Revenge alone had carried Philip into these im∣politic
measures; and a point of honour had hitherto in∣duced
him to maintain them. But as it is the nature of
passion gradually to decay; while the sense of interest
maintains an eternal influence and authority; the duke
had, for some years, appeared sensibly to relent in his
animosity against Charles, and to hearken willingly to
the apologies made by that prince for the murder of the
late duke of Burgundy. His extreme youth was pleaded
in his favour; his incapacity to judge for himself; the
ascendant gained over him by his ministers; and his in∣ability
<PB N="168" REF="180"/>
to resent a deed, which, without his knowledge,
had been perpetrated by those under whose guidance he
was then placed. The more to gratify the pride of Philip,
the King of France had banished from his court and
presence Tanegui de Chatel, and all those concerned in
that assassination; and had offered to make any other
atonement, which could be required of him. The ills,
which Charles had already suffered, had tended to gratify
the duke's revenge; the miseries to which France had
been so long exposed, had begun to move his compas∣sion;
and the cries of all Europe admonished him, that
his resentment, which might hitherto be deemed pious,
would, if carried farther, be universally condemned as
barbarous and unrelenting. While the duke was in this
disposition, every disgust, which he received from Eng∣land,
made a double impression upon him; the entreaties
of the count de Richemont and the duke of Bourbon, who
had married his two sisters, had weight; and he deter∣mined
finally to unite himself to the royal family of
France, from which his own was descended. For this
purpose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1435.</NOTE> a congress was appointed at Arras under the
mediation of deputies from the Pope and the council of Bas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e:
The duke of Burgundy came thither in person:
The duke of Bourbon, the count de Richemont and
other persons of high rank, appeared as ambassadors from
France: And the English having also been invited to
attend, the cardinal of Winchester, the archbishop of
York, and others, received from the protector and
council a commission for that purpose<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Monstrelet, vol. ii. p. 110.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE conferences were held in the abbey of St. Vaast;<NOTE PLACE="marg">August.</NOTE>
and began with discussing the proposals of the two
crowns, which were so wide of each other as to admit
of no hopes of accommodation. England offered, that
<PB N="169" REF="181"/>
each party should remain in possession of what they had
at present, after making some equal exchanges for mutual
convenience: France offered to cede Normandy with
Guienne, but both of them loaded with the usual homage
and vassalage to the crown. As the claims of England
upon France were universally unpopular in Europe; the
mediators declared the offers of Charles very reasonable;
and the cardinal of Winchester, with the English ambas∣sadors,
immediately left the congress. There remained
nothing but to discuss the mutual pretensions of Charles
and Philip. These were easily adjusted: The vassal was
in a situation to give law to his superior; and he exact∣ed
conditions, which, had it not been for the present ne∣cessity,
would have been deemed, to the last degree, dis∣honourable
and disadvantageous to the crown of France.
Besides making repeated atonements and acknowledge∣ments
for the murder of the duke of Burgundy, Charles
was obliged to cede all the towns of Picardy which lay
between the Somme and the Low Countries; he yielded
several other territories; he agreed, that these and all the
other dominions of Philip should be held by him, during
his life-time, without doing any homage or swearing
fealty to the present King; and he freed his subjects
from all obligations to allegiance, if ever he infringed
this treaty<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Monstrelet, vol. ii. p. 112. Graston, p. 565.</NOTE>. Such were the conditions, upon which
France purchased the friendship of the duke of Bur∣gundy.</P>
<P>THE duke sent over a herald to England with a letter,
in which he notified the conclusion of the treaty of Ar∣ras,
and apologized for his departure from that of Troye.
The council received the herald with great coldness:
They even assigned him his lodgings in a shoemaker's
house, by way of insult; and the populace were so in∣censed,
<PB N="170" REF="182"/>
that, if the duke of Glocester had not given him
guards, his life would have been exposed to danger, when
he appeared in the streets. The Flemings, and other
subjects of Philip, were insulted, and some of them mur∣dered
by the Londoners; and every thing seemed to tend
towards a rupture between the two nations<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Monstrelet, vol. ii. p. 120. Hollingshed, p. 612.</NOTE>. These
violences were not disagreeable to the duke of Burgundy;
as they afforded him a pretence for the farther measures,
which he intended to take against the English, whom
he now regarded as implacable and dangerous enemies.</P>
<P>A FEW days after the duke of Bedford received intel∣ligence<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th Sept. Death of the duke of Bedford.</NOTE>
of this treaty, so fatal to the interests of England,
he died at Roüen; a prince of great abilities, and of
many virtues; and whose memory, except from the bar∣barous
execution of the maid of Orleans, was unsullied
by any considerable blemish. Isabella, Queen of France,
died a little before him, despised by the English, detested
by the French, and reduced in her latter years to regard
with an unnatural horror, the progress and successes of
her own son, in recovering possession of his kingdom.
This period was also signalized by the death of the earl
of Arundel<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Monstrelet, vol. ii. p. 105. Hollingshed, p. 610.</NOTE>, a great English general, who, tho' he
commanded three thousand men, was foiled by Xain∣trailles
at the head of six hundred, and soon after expired
of the wounds which he received in the action.</P>
<P>THE violent factions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1436.</NOTE> which prevailed in the court
of England, between the duke of Glocester and the car∣dinal
of Winchester, prevented the English from taking
the proper measures for repairing these multiplied losses;
and threw all their affairs into confusion. The popu∣larity
of the duke and his near relation to the crown,
gave him advantages in the contest, which he often lost
<PB N="171" REF="183"/>
by his open and unguarded temper, unfit to struggle
with the politic and interested spirit of his rival. The
balance, meanwhile, of these parties, kept every thing
in suspence: Foreign affairs were much neglected: And
tho' the duke of York, son to that earl of Cam∣bridge,
who was executed in the beginning of the last
reign, was appointed successor to the duke of Bedford,
it was seven months before his commission passed the
seals; and the English remained so long in an enemy's
country, without a proper head or governor.</P>
<P>THE new governor on his arrival found the capital
already lost.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Decline of the English in France.</NOTE> The Parisians had always been more at∣tached
to the Burgundian than to the English interest;
and after the conclusion of the treaty of Arras, their
affections, without any farther controul, universally led
them to return to their allegiance under their native so∣vereign.
The constable, together with Lile-Adam, the
same person who had before put Paris into the hands of
the duke of Burgundy, was introduced in the night-time
by intelligence with the citizens: The lord Willoughby,
who commanded only a small garrison of 1500 men, was
expelled: That nobleman discovered great valour and pre∣sence
of mind on the occasion; but unable to guard
so large a place against such multitudes, he retired into
the Bastile, and being there invested, delivered up the
place, and was contented to stipulate for the safe retreat
of his troops into Normandy<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Monstrelet, vol. ii. p. 127. Grafton, p. 568.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the same season, the duke of Burgundy took
openly part against England, and commenced hostili∣ties
by the siege of Calais, the only place which now
gave the English any sure hold of France, and still ren∣dered
them dangerous. As he was beloved among his
own subjects, and had acquired the epithet of <HI>Good,</HI> from
<PB N="172" REF="184"/>
his popular qualities, he was able to interest all the in∣habitants
of the Low-Countries in the success of this
enterprize; and he invested that place with an army,
very formidable from its numbers, but without experi∣ence,
discipline, or military spirit<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Monstrelet, vol. ii. p. 126. 130. 132. Hollingshed, p. 613. Grafton, p. 571.</NOTE>. On the first alarm
of this siege, the duke of Glocester assembled some for∣ces,
sent a defiance to Philip, and challenged him to
wait the event of a battle, which he promised to give,
as soon as the wind would permit him to reach Calais.
The warlike genius of the English had at that time
rendered them terrible to all the northern parts of Europe;
much more to the Flemings, who were more expert in
manufactures, than in arms; and the duke of Burgundy,
being already foiled in some attempts before Calais, and
observing the discontent and terror of his own army,
thought proper to raise the siege, and to retreat into his<NOTE PLACE="marg">26th June.</NOTE>
own territories, before the arrival of the enemy<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Monstrelet, vol. ii. p. 136. Hollingshed, p. 614.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE English were still masters of many fine provin∣ces
in France; but retained possession, more by the ex∣treme
weakness of Charles, than by the strength of their
own garrisons or the force of their armies. Nothing
indeed can be more surprising than the feeble efforts
made, during the course of several years, by these two
potent nations against each other; while the one strug∣gled
for independancy, and the other aspired to a total
conquest of its rival. The general want of industry,
commerce, and police, in that age, had rendered all the
European nations, and France and England no less than
the others, unfit for bearing the burthens of war, when
it was prolonged beyond one season; and the continu∣ance
of hostilities had, long ere this time, exhausted the
force and patience of both these kingdoms. Scarce
<PB N="173" REF="185"/>
could the appearance of an army be brought into the
field on either side; and all the mighty operations con∣sisted
in the surprize of places, in the rencounter of de∣tached
parties, and in incursions upon the open coun∣try;
which were performed by small bodies assembled
on a sudden from the neighbouring garrisons. In this
method of conducting the war, the French King had
much the advantage: The affections of the people were
entirely on his side: Intelligence was early brought him
of the state and motions of the enemy: The inhabitants
were ready to join in any attempts against the garrisons:
And thus ground was continually, tho' slowly, gained
against the English. The duke of York, who was a
prince of ability, struggled against these difficulties during
the course of five years; and being assisted by the valour
of lord Talbot, soon after created earl of Shrewsbury,
he performed actions which acquired him honour, but
merit not the attention of posterity. It would have been
well, had this feeble war, in sparing the blood of the
people, prevented likewise all other oppressions; and
had the fury of men, which reason and justice cannot
restrain, thus happily received a check from their impo∣tence
and inability. But the French and English, tho'
they exerted such small force, were, however, stretching
beyond their resources, which were still smaller; and the
troops, destitute of pay, were obliged to subsist by plun∣dering
and oppressing the country, both of friends and
enemies. The fields in all the north of France, which
was the seat of war, were laid waste and left unculti∣vated<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 562.</NOTE>.
The cities were gradually depopulated, not by
the blood spilt in battle, but by the more destructive pil∣lage
of the garrisons: And both parties, weary of hosti∣lities,
which decided nothing, seemed at last desirous of
<PB N="174" REF="186"/>
peace, and they set on foot negotiations for that pur∣pose.
But the proposals which came from France and
from England, were still so wide of each other, that all
hopes of accommodation immediately vanished. The
English ambassadors demanded restitution of all the pro∣vinces
which had once been annexed to England, to∣gether
with the final cession of Calais and its district;
and required the possession of these extensive terri∣tories
without the burthen of any fealty or homage
on the part of their prince: The French offered only
part of Guienne, part of Normandy, and Calais, loaded
with the usual burthens. It appeared in vain to continue
the negociation, while there was so little prospect of
agreement. The English were still too haughty to stoop
from the vast hopes, which they had formerly entertained,
and to accept of terms more suitable to the present con∣dition
of the two kingdoms.</P>
<P>THE duke of York soon after resigned his govern∣ment
to the earl of Warwic, a nobleman of reputa∣tion,
whom death prevented from a long enjoyment of
his dignity. The duke, upon the demise of this noble∣man,
returned to his charge, and during his administra∣tion
a truce was concluded between the King of England
and the duke of Burgundy, which had become necessary
for the commercial interest of their subjects<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 573.</NOTE>. The war
with France continued in the same languid and feeble
state as before.</P>
<P>THE captivity of five princes of the blood, taken pri∣soners
in the battle of Azincour, was a considerable ad∣vantage
which England long enjoyed above its enemy;
but this superiority was now entirely lost. Some of
these princes had died; some had been ransomed for sums
of money; and the duke of Orleans, the most powerful
among them, was the last who remained in the hands of
<PB N="175" REF="187"/>
the English. He offered the sum of 54,000 nobles<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. x. p. 764. 776. 782. 795, 796. This sum was equal to 36,000 pounds sterling of our present money. A subsidy of a tenth and fifteenth was fixed by Edward III. at 29,000 pounds, that is 58,000 of our present money. The parliament granted only one subsidy during the course of seven years, from 1437 to 1444.</NOTE> for
his liberty; and when this proposal was laid before the
council of England, as every question was there an ob∣ject
of faction, the party of the duke of Glocester, and
that of the cardinal of Winchester, were divided in their
sentiments with regard to it. The duke reminded the
council of the dying advice of the late King, that none
of these prisoners should on any account be released, till
his son was of sufficient age to hold, himself, the
reins of government. The cardinal insisted on the great∣ness
of the sum proffered, which in reality was near
equal to two thirds of all the extraordinary supplies, that
the parliament, during the course of seven years, granted
for the support of the war. And he added, that the re∣lease
of this prince was more likely to be advantageous
than prejudicial to the English interests; by filling the
court of France with faction, and giving a head to those
numerous malecontents, whom Charles was at present¦able
with great difficulty to restrain. The cardinal's
party, as usual, prevailed: The duke of Orleans was
released, after a melancholy captivity of twenty-five
years<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 578.</NOTE>: And the duke of Burgundy, as a pledge of his
entire reconciliation with the family of Orleans, facili∣tated
to that prince the payment of his ransom. It must
be confessed, that the princes and nobility in those ages,
went to war on very disadvantageous terms. If they were
taken prisoners, they either remained in captivity during
life, or purchased their liberty at the price which the

THE sentiments of the cardinal, some time after, pre∣vailed
in another point of still greater moment. That
prelate had always encouraged every proposal of accom∣modation
with France; and had represented the utter
impossibility, in the present circumstances, of pushing
farther the conquests in that kingdom, and the great dif∣ficulty
of even maintaining those which were already
made. He insisted on the extreme reluctance of the
parliament to grant supplies; the disorders in which the
English affairs in Normandy were involved; the daily
progress made by the French King; and the advantage
of stopping his hand by a temporary accommodation,
which might leave room for time and accidents to ope∣rate
in favour of the English. The duke of Glocester,
high spirited and haughty, and educated in the lofty pre∣tensions,
which the first successes of his two brothers
had rendered familiar to him, could not yet be induced
to relinquish all hopes of prevailing over France; much
less, could he see with patience, his own opinion thwarted
and rejected by the influence of his rival in the English
council. But notwithstanding his opposition, the earl
of Suffolk, a nobleman who always adhered to the car∣dinal's
party, was dispatched to Tours, in order to ne∣gotiate
with the French ministers. It was found im∣possible
to adjust the terms of a lasting peace; but a truce
for twenty-two months was concluded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th May. Truce with France.</NOTE> which left every
thing on the present footing between the parties. The
numerous disorders, under which the French government
laboured, and which time alone could remedy, induced
Charles to assent to this truce; and the same motives
engaged him afterwards to prolong it<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Raymer, vol. ix. p. 101. 108. 206. 214.</NOTE>. But Suffolk,
not content with executing this object of his commission,
proceeded also to finish another business, which seems
<PB N="177" REF="191"/>
rather to have been implied than included in the powers,
which had been granted him<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xi. p. 53.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN proportion as Henry advanced in years, his cha∣racter
became fully known in the court, and was no
longer ambiguous to either faction. Of the most harm∣less,
inoffensive, simple manners; but of the most slender
capacity; he was fitted, both by the softness of his tem∣per,
and the weakness of his understanding, to be per∣petually
governed by those who surrounded him; and it
was easy to foresee, that his reign would prove a perpe∣tual
minority. As he had now reached the twenty-third
year of his age, it was natural to think of choosing him
a Queen; and each party was ambitious of having him
receive one from their hand; as it was probable, that this
circumstance would decide forever the victory between
them. The duke of Glocester proposed a daughter of
the count d'Armagnac; but had not credit to effectuate
his purpose. The cardinal and his friends had cast their
eye on Margaret of Anjou, daughter of Regnier, titular
King of Sicily, Naples, and Jerusalem, descended from
the count of Anjou, brother of Charles V. who had left
these magnificent titles, but without any real power or
possessions, to his posterity. This princess herself was
the most accomplished of her age both in body and mind;
and seemed to possess those qualities, which would
equally qualify her to acquire the ascendant over Henry,
and to supply all his defects and weaknesses. Of a
masculine, courageous spirit, of an enterprizing temper,
endowed with solidity as well as vivacity of understand∣ing,
she had not been able to conceal these great talents
even in the privacy of her father's family; and it was
reasonable to expect, that, when she should mount the
throne, they would break out with still superior lustre.
The earl of Suffolk, therefore, in concert with his asso∣ciates
<PB N="178" REF="192"/>
of the English council, made proposals of marriage
to Margaret, which were accepted. But this nobleman,
besides pre-occupying the princess's favour by being the
chief means of her advancement, endeavoured to ingra∣tiate
himself with her and her family, by very extraor∣dinary
concessions: Tho' Margaret brought no dowry
with her,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of the King with Mar∣garet of Anjou.</NOTE> he ventured of himself, without any direct au∣thority
from the council, but probably with the allowance
of the cardinal, and the ruling members, to engage by
a secret article, that the province of Maine, which was
at that time in the hands of the English, should be de∣livered
up to Charles of Anjou her uncle<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 590.</NOTE>, who was
prime minister and favourite of the French King, and who
had already received from his master the grant of that
province as his appanage.</P>
<P>THE treaty of marriage was ratified in England:
Suffolk obtained first the title of marquis, then that of
duke; and even received the thanks of parliament, for
his services in concluding it<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 630.</NOTE>. The princess fell imme∣diately
into close connexions with the cardinal and his
party, the dukes of Somerset, Suffolk, and Buckingham<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hollingshed, p. 626.</NOTE>;
who, fortified by her powerful friendship, resolved on the
final ruin of the duke of Glocester.</P>
<P>THIS generous prince, worsted in all court intrigues,
for which his temper was not suited, but possessing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1447.</NOTE> in a
high degree, the favour of the public, had already re∣ceived
from his rivals a most cruel mortification, which
he had hitherto born patiently, but which it was impos∣sible,
that a person of his spirit and humanity could ever
forgive. His dutchess, the daughter of Reginald, lord
Cobham, had been accused of the crime of witchcraft, and
it was pretended, that a waxen figure of the King was
<PB N="179" REF="193"/>
found in her possession, which she and her associates, Sir
Roger Bolingbroke a priest, and one Margery Jordan of
Eye, melted in a magical manner before a slow fire, with
an intention of making Henry's force and vigour waste
away, by like insensible degrees. The accusation was
well calculated to affect the weak and credulous mind of
the King, and to gain belief in an ignorant age; and the
dutchess was brought to trial with her confederates.
The nature of this crime, so opposite to all common
sense, seems always to exempt the accusers from observing
the rules of common sense in their evidence: The pri∣soners
were pronounced guilty; the dutchess was con∣demned
to do public penance, and to suffer perpetual
imprisonment, and the others were executed<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 381. Hollingshed, p. 622. Grafton, p. 587.</NOTE>. But as
these violent proceedings were ascribed solely to the ma∣lice
of the duke's enemies, the people, contrary to their
usual practice on such occasions, acquitted the unhappy
sufferers; and encreased their esteem and affection to∣wards
a prince, who was thus exposed, without protec∣tion,
to such mortal injuries.</P>
<P>THESE sentiments of the public made the cardinal
of Winchester and his party sensible, that it was necessary
to destroy a man, whose popularity might become dan∣gerous,
and whose resentment they had so much cause
to apprehend. In order to effectuate their purpose, a par∣liament
was summoned to meet, not at London, which
was supposed to be too well affected to the duke, but at
St. Edmondsbury, where they expected that he would lie
entirely at mercy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th Feb. Murder of the duke of Glocester.</NOTE> As soon as he appeared, he was ac∣cused
of treason, and thrown into prison. He was soon
after found dead in his bed<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 597.</NOTE>; and tho' it was pretended
that his death was natural, and tho' his body, which
<PB N="180" REF="194"/>
was exposed to public view, bore no marks of outward
injury, no one doubted that he had fallen a sacrifice to
the vengeance of his enemies. A trick, formerly practised
on Edward II. on Richard II. and on Thomas of Wood∣stock,
duke of Glocester, could deceive no body. The
reason of this violence seems not, that the ruling party
apprehended his acquittal in parliament on account of his
innocence, which, in such times, was seldom much re∣garded;
but that they imagined his public trial and exe∣cution
would have been more invidious than his private
murder, which they pretended to deny. Some gentlemen
of his retinue were afterwards tried for aiding him in his
treasons, and were condemned to be hanged, drawn and
quartered. They were hanged and cut down; but just
as the executioner was proceeding to quarter them, their
pardon was produced, and they were recovered to life<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Fabian Chron. anno 1477.</NOTE>
The most barbarous kind of mercy that can possibly be
imagined!</P>
<P>THIS prince is said to have received a more learned
education than was usual in his age, to have founded one
of the first public libraries in England, and to have been
a great patron of learned men. Among other advantages,
which he reaped from this turn of mind, it tended much,
to cure him of credulity; of which the following in∣stance
is given by Sir Thomas More. There was a man,
who pretended, that, tho' he was born blind, he had re∣covered
his sight by touching the shrine of St. Albans.
The duke, happening soon after to pass that way, que∣stioned
the man, and seeming to doubt of his sight, asked
him the colour of several cloaks, worn by persons in his
retinue. The man told him very readily. <HI>You are a
knave,</HI> cried the prince; <HI>had you been born blind, you could
not have distinguished colours:</HI> And immediately ordered
him to be put in the stocks as an impostor<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 597.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="195"/>
THE cardinal of Winchester died fix weeks after his
nephew, whose murder was universally ascribed to him
as well as to the duke of Suffolk, and which, it is said,
gave him more remorse in his last moments, than could
naturally be expected from a man hardened, during the
course of a long life, in falshood and in politics. What
share the Queen had in this guilt is uncertain; her usual
activity and spirit made the public conclude with some
reason that the duke's enemies durst not have ventured
on such a deed without her privity. But there hap∣pened
soon after an event, of which she and her favourite,
the duke of Suffolk, bore uncontestibly the whole odium.</P>
<P>THAT article of the marriage treaty, by which the
province of Maine was to be yielded to Charles of An∣jou,
the Queen's uncle, had probably been hitherto kept
a secret; and during the lifetime of the duke of Glo∣cester,
it would have been dangerous to venture on the
execution of it. But as the court of France insisted stre∣nuously
on performance, orders were now dispatched,
under Henry's hand, to Sir Francis Surienne, governor
of Mans, commanding him to surrender that place to
Charles of Anjou. Surienne, either questioning the au∣thenticity
of the order, or regarding his government as
his only fortune, refused compliance; and it became ne∣cessary
for a French army, under the count de Dunois,
to lay siege to the city. The governor made as good a
defence as his situation could permit; but receiving no
relief from Edmund duke of Somerset, who was at that
time governor of Normandy, he was at last obliged to
capitulate, and to surrender not only Mans, but all the
other fortresses of that province, which was thus en∣tirely
alienated from the crown of England.</P>
<P>THE bad effects of this measure stopped not here.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1448.</NOTE>
Surienne, at the head of all his garrisons, amounting to
2500 men, retired into Normandy, in expectation of
<PB N="182" REF="196"/>
being taken into pay, and of being quartered in some
towns of that province. But Somerset, who had no
means of subsisting such a multitude, and who was pro∣bably
incensed at Surienne's disobedience, refused to admit
him; and this adventurer, not daring to commit depre∣dations
on the territories either of the King of France
or of England, marched into Brittany, seized the town
of Fougeres, repaired the fortifications of Pontorson and
St. James de Beuvron, and subsisted his troops by the
ravages, which he committed on all that province<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Monstrelet, vol. iii. p. 6.</NOTE>. The
duke of Brittany complained of this violence to the
King of France, his liege lord: Charles remonstrated
with the duke of Somerset: That nobleman replied,
that the injury was done without his privity, and that
he had no authority over Surienne and his companions<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 7. Hollingshed, p. 629.</NOTE>.
Tho' this answer might appear very satisfactory to Charles,
who had often felt severely the licentious, independant
spirit of such mercenary soldiers, he never would admit
the apology. He still insisted, that these plunderers
should be recalled, and that reparation should be made
to the duke of Brittany for all the damages, which they
had committed: And in order to render an accommoda∣tion
absolutely impracticable, he made the estimation of
damages amount to no less a sum than 1,600,000 crowns.
He was sensible of the superiority, which the present
state of his affairs gave him over England; and he de∣termined
to take advantage of it</P>
<P>No sooner was the truce concluded between the two<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of France.</NOTE>
kingdoms, than Charles employed himself, with great
industry and judgment, in repairing those numberless ills,
to which France, from the continuance of wars both
foreign and domestic, had so long been exposed. He
restored the course of public justice; he introduced order
<PB N="183" REF="197"/>
into the finances; he established discipline in his troops;
he repressed faction in his court; he revived the languid
state of agriculture and the arts; and in the course of a
few years, he rendered his kingdom flourishing within
itself, and formidable to all its neighbours. Meanwhile,
affairs in England had taken a very different turn. The
court was divided into parties, which were enraged
against each other: The people were discontented with
the government: Conquests in France, which were an
object more of glory than of interest, were overlooked
amidst domestic incidents, which engrossed all mens at∣tention:
The governor of Normandy, ill supplied with
money, was obliged to dismiss the greater part of his
troops, and to allow the fortifications of the towns and
castles to fall into disrepair: And the nobility and people
of that province had, during the open communication
with France, enjoyed frequent opportunities of renewing
connexions with their antient master, and of concert∣ing
the means for expelling the English.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1449.</NOTE> The occasion
therefore seemed favourable to Charles for breaking the
truce;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Renewal of the war with France.</NOTE> and Normandy was at once invaded by four
powerful armies; one commanded by the King himself;
a second by the duke of Brittany; a third by the duke of
Alençon; and a fourth by the count de Dunois. The
places opened their gates almost as soon as the French ap∣peared
before them: Verneüil, Nogent, Chateau Gaillard,
Ponteau de mer, Gisors, Mant<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Vernon, Argentan,
Lisieux, Fecamp, Coutances, Belesme, Pont de l'Arche,
fell in an instant into the hands of the enemy: The duke
of Somerset was so far from having an army, which could
take the field, and relieve these places, that he was not
able to supply them with the necessary garrisons and
provisions: He retired with the few troops, of which he
was master, into Roüen; and thought it sufficient, if,
till the arrival of succours from England, he could save
<PB N="184" REF="198"/>
that capital from the general ftate of the province. The
King of France, at the head of a formidable army, fifty
thousand strong, presented himself before the gates:
The dangerous example of revolt had infected the inha∣bitants,
and they called aloud for a capitulation. So∣merset,
unable to resist at once both the enemies within
and from without, retired with his garrison into the pa∣lace
and castle; which, being places not tenable, he
was obliged to surrender: He purchased a retreat to Har∣fleur
by the payment of 56,000 crowns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th Nov.</NOTE> by engaging to
surrender Arques, Tancarville, Caudebec, Honfleur,
and other places in the higher Normandy, and by deli∣vering
hostages for the performance of these articles<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Monstrelet, vol, iii. p. 21. Grafton, p. 643.</NOTE>.
The governor of Honfleur refused to obey his orders;
upon which, the earl of Shrewsbury, who was one of
the hostages, was detained prisoner; and the English
were thus deprived of the only general, capable of re∣covering
them from their present distressed situation.
Harfleur made a better defence under Sir Thomas Cur∣son,
the governor; but was finally obliged to open its
gates to the count de Dunois. Succours at last appeared
from England under Sir Thomas Kyriel, and landed
at Cherbourg: But these came very late, amounted only
to 4000 men, and were soon after put to rout at Four∣migni
by the count de Clermont<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Hollingshed, p. 631.</NOTE>. This battle, or ra∣ther
skirmish, was the only action fought by the Eng∣lish
for the defence of their dominions in France, which
they had purchased, at such an expence of blood and
treasure. Somerset, shut up in Caën without any prospect
of relief, found it necessary to capitulate: Falaise opened
its gates, on condition that the earl of Shrewsbury
should be restored to liberty: And Cherbourg, the last
place of Normandy, which remained in the hands of the
<PB N="185" REF="199"/>
English, being delivered up, the conquest of that im∣portant
province was finished in a twelvemonth by
Charles, to the infinite joy of the inhabitants and of
his whole kingdom<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 646.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A LIKE rapid success attended the French arms in
Guienne; tho' the inhabitants of that province were,
from long custom, better inclined to the Eng∣lish go∣vernment.
The count de Dunois was dispatched thi∣ther,
and met with no resistance in the field, and very
little from the towns. Great improvements had been
made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Eng∣lish expel∣led France.</NOTE> during this age, in the structure and management
of artillery, and none in fortification; and the art of
defence was by that means more unequal, than either
before or since, to the art of attack. After all the small
places about Bourdeaux were reduced, that city agreed
to submit, if not relieved by a certain time; and as no
one in England thought seriously of these distant con∣cerns,
no relief appeared; the place surrendered; and
Bayonne being taken soon after, this whole province,
which had remained united to England, since the acces∣sion
of Henry II. was, after a period of three centuries,
finally swallowed up by the French monarchy.</P>
<P>THO' no peace nor truce was concluded between
France and England, the war was in a manner at an
end. The English, torn in pieces by the civil dissen∣sions
which ensued, made but one feeble effort more
for the recovery of Guienne: And Charles, occupied
at home, in regulating the government, and fencing
against the intrigues of his factious son, Lewis the Dau∣phin,
scarce ever attempted to invade them in their island,
or to retaliate upon them, by availing himself of their
intestine confusions.</P>

<P>A WEAK prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXI.</NOTE> seated on the throne of England,
had never failed, however gentle and innocent,
to be infested with faction, discontent, rebellion, and
civil commotions; and as the incapacity of Henry ap∣peared
every day in a fuller light, these dangerous con∣sequences began, from past experience, to be universally
and justly apprehended. Men also of unquiet spirits, no
longer employed in foreign wars, whence they were now
excluded by the situation of the neighbouring states,
were the more likely to excite intestine disorders, and
by their emulation, rivalship, and animosities, to tear
the bowels of their native country. But tho' these
causes alone were sufficient to breed confusion, there con∣curred
another circumstance of the most dangerous na∣ture:
A pretender to the crown appeared. The title itself
<PB N="187" REF="201"/>
of the weak prince, who enjoyed the name of sovereignty,
was disputed: And the English were now to pay the
severe, tho' late penalty, of their turbulence against
Richard II. and of their levity in violating, without any
necessity or just reason, the lineal succession of their mo∣narchs.</P>
<P>ALL the males of the house of Mortimer were ex∣tinct;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Claim of the duke of York to the crown.</NOTE>
but Anne, the sister of the last earl of Marche,
having espoused the earl of Cambridge, beheaded in the
reign of Henry V. had transmitted her latent, but not
yet forgotten claim to her son, Richard, duke of York.
This prince, thus descended by his mother from Phi∣lippa,
only daughter of the duke of Clarence, second
son of Edward III. stood plainly in the order of succes∣sion
before the King, who derived his descent from the
duke of Lancaster, third son of that monarch; and that
claim could not, in many respects, have fallen into more
dangerous hands than those of the duke of York.
Richard was a man of valour and abilities, of a prudent
conduct and mild dispositions: He had enjoyed an op∣portunity
of displaying these virtues in his government
of France: And tho' recalled from that command by
the intrigues and superior interest of the duke of Somer∣set,
he had been sent to suppress a rebellion in Ireland;
had succeeded, much better in that enterprize than his
rival in the defence of Normandy; and had even been
able to attach to his person and family, the whole Irish
nation, whom he was sent to subdue<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 387.</NOTE> In the right of
his father, he bore the rank of first prince of the blood;
and by this station, he gave a lustre to his title derived
from the family of Mortimer, which, tho' of great no∣bility,
was equaled by other families in the kingdom,
and had been eclipsed by the royal descent of the house
<PB N="188" REF="202"/>
of Lancaster. He possessed an immense fortune from the
union of so many successions, those of Cambridge and
York on the one hand, with those of Mortimer on the
other: Which last inheritance had before been augmented
by an union of the estates of Clarence and Ulster, with
the patrimonial possessions of the family of Marche. The
alliances too of Richard, in marrying the daughter of
Ralph Nevil, earl of Westmoreland, had very widely
extended his interest among the nobility, and had pro∣cured
him many connexions in that formidable order.</P>
<P>THE family of Nevil was perhaps at this time the most
potent, both from their opulent possessions and from the
characters of the men, that has ever appeared in Eng∣land.
For besides the earl of Westmoreland, the lords
Latimer, Fauconbridge, and Abergavenny; the earls
of Salisbury and Warwic were of that family, and were
of themselves, on many accounts, the greatest noblemen
of the kingdom. The earl of Salisbury, brother-in-law
to the duke of York, was the eldest son by a second
marriage of the earl of Westmoreland; and inherited by
his wife, daughter and heir of Montacute, earl of Sa∣lisbury,
killed before Orleans, the possessions and title of
that great family. His eldest: son, Richard, had married
Anne, the daughter and heir of Beauchamp, earl of
Warwic, who died governor of France; and by that
alliance he enjoyed the possessions, and had acquired the
title of that other family, one of the most opulent, most
antient,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The earl of Warwic.</NOTE> and most illustrious of the kingdom. The per∣sonal
qualities also of these two earls, especially of War∣wic,
enhanced the splendor of their nobility, and en∣creased
their influence over the people. This latter
nobleman, commonly known, from the subsequent
events, by the appellation of the <HI>King-maker,</HI> had distin∣guished
himself, by his gallantry in the field, by the hospi∣tality
of his table, by the magnificence, and still more
<PB N="189" REF="203"/>
by the generosity of his expence, and by the spirited and
bold manner, which attended him in all his actions.
The undesigning frankness and openness of his character
rendered his conquest over men's affections the more cer∣tain
and infallible: His presents were regarded as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure
testimonies of esteem and friendship; and his professions
as the overflowings of his genuine sentiments. No less
than 30,000 people are said to have daily lived at his
board in the different manors and castles which he pos∣sessed
in England: The military men, allured by his
munificence and hospitality, as well as by his bravery,
were zealously attached to his interests: The people in
general bore him an unlimited affection: His numerous
retainers were more devoted to his will, than to the
prince or to the laws: And he was the greatest, as well
as the last, of those mighty barons, who formerly over∣awed
the crown, and rendered the people incapable of
any regular system of civil government.</P>
<P>BUT the duke of York, besides the family of Nevil,
had many other partizans among the great nobility.
Courtney, earl of Devonshire, descended from the royal
blood of France, was attached to his interests: Mou∣bray,
duke of Norfolk, from his hereditary hatred to the
family of Lancaster, had embraced the same party: And
the discontents, which universally prevailed among the
people, rendered every combination of the great the more
dangerous to the established government.</P>
<P>THO' the people were never willing to grant the
supplies necessary for keeping possession of the conquered
provinces in France, they repined extremely at the loss
of these boasted acquisitions; and fancied, because a sud∣den
irruption could make conquests, that, without steady
counsels and an uniform expence, it was possible to main∣tain
them. The voluntary cession of Maine to the queen's uncle,
had made them suspect treachery in the loss of
<PB N="190" REF="204"/>
Normandy and Guienne. They still considered Mar∣garet
as a French woman and a latent enemy of the
kingdom. And when they saw her father and all her
relations active in promoting the success of the French,
they could not be persuaded, that she, who was all
powerful in the English council, would very zealously
oppose them in their enterprizes.</P>
<P>BUT the most fatal blow, which was given to the po∣polarity
of the crown and to the interests of the house
of Lancaster, was by the assassination of the virtuous
duke of Glocester, whose character, had he been alive,
would have kept in awe the partizans of York, but
whose memory, being extremely cherished by the people,
served to throw an infinite odium on all his murderers.
By this event, the reigning family suffered a double pre∣judice:
It was deprived of its firmest support; and it was
loaded with all the infamy of that imprudent and bar∣barous
execution.</P>
<P>AS the duke of Suffolk was known to have had an
active hand in this crime, he partook deeply of the ha∣tred,
which attended it; and the clamours, which neces∣sarily
rose against him, as prime minister and declared fa∣vourite
of the queen, were thereby augmented to a ten∣fold
pitch, and became absolutely uncontroleable. The
great nobility could ill brook to see a subject exalted
above them; much more one who was only great grand∣son
to a merchant, and who was of a birth so much in∣ferior
to theirs. The people complained of his arbitrary
measures; which were, in some degree, a necessary con∣sequence
of the irregular power then possessed by the
prince, but which the least disaffection easily magnified
into tyranny. The immense acquisitions, which he daily
made, were the object of envy; and as they were made
at the expence of the crown, which was itself reduced
to the most scandalous poverty, they appeared on that
<PB N="191" REF="205"/>
account, to all indifferent persons, the more exception∣able
and invidious.</P>
<P>THE revenues of the crown, which had long been
disproportioned to its power and dignity, had been ex∣tremely
dilapidated during the minority of Henry<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 609.</NOTE>;
both by the rapacity of the courtiers, which the King's
uncles could not controul, and by the necessary expences
of the French war, which had always been so ill supplied
by the grants of parliament. The royal demesnes were dis∣sipated,
and at the same time the King was loaded with
a debt of 372,000 pounds, a sum so immense, that the
parliament could never think of discharging it. This un∣happy
situation forced the ministers upon many arbitrary
measures: The household itself could not be supported
without stretching to the utmost the right of purveyance,
and rendering it a kind of universal robbery upon the
people: The public clamour rose high upon this occa∣sion,
and no one had the equity to make allowance for
the necessity of the King's situation. Suffolk, once be∣come
odious, bore the blame of the whole; and every
grievance in every part of the administration was uni∣versally
imputed to his tyranny and injustice.</P>
<P>THIS nobleman, sensible of the public hatred under
which he laboured,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Impeach∣ment of the duke of Suffolk.</NOTE> and foreseeing an attack from the
commons, endeavoured to overawe his enemies, by boldly
presenting himself to the charge, and by insisting upon
his own innocence, and even upon his merits and those of
his family in the public service. He rose up in the house
of peers; took notice of the clamours propagated against
him; and complained, that, after serving the crown in
thirty-four campaigns, after staying abroad seventeen
years without once returning to his own country; after
losing a father and three brothers in the wars with France;
<PB N="192" REF="206"/>
after being himself a prisoner, and purchasing his liberty
by a large ransom; it should yet be suspected, that he
had been debauched from his allegiance by that enemy
whom he had ever opposed with such zeal and fortitude,
and that he had betrayed his prince, who had rewarded
his services by the highest honours and greatest offices,
which it was in his power to confer<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 641.</NOTE>. This speech did
not answer the purpose intended. The commons, rather
the more provoked at his challenge, opened their charge
against Suffolk, and sent up to the house of peers an ac∣cusation
of high treason, divided into several articles.
They insisted, that he had persuaded the French King
to invade England with an armed force, in order to
depose the King, to place on the throne his own son,
John de la Pole, whom he intended to marry to Mar∣garet,
the only daughter of the late John, duke of So∣merset,
and to whom, he imagined, he would by that
means acquire a title to the crown: That he had con∣tributed
to the release of the duke of Orleans, in hopes,
that that prince would aid and assist King Charles in
expelling the English from France, and recovering full
possession of his kingdom: That he had afterwards en∣couraged
that King to make open war on Normandy
and Guienne, and had promoted his conquests by betray∣ing
the secrets of England, and obstructing the succours
proposed to be sent over to those provinces: And that he
had, without any powers or commission, promised by
treaty to deliver up the province of Maine to Charles of
Anjou, and had accordingly delivered it up; a concession,
which proved in the issue the chief cause of the loss of
Normandy<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 642. Hall, fol. 157. Holingshed, p. 631. Grafton, p. 607.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="207"/>
IT is evident, from a review of these articles, that the
commons adopted without enquiry all the popular cla∣mours
against the duke of Suffolk, and charged him with
crimes, of which none but the vulgar could seriously
believe him guilty. Nothing can be more incredible,
than that a nobleman of his rank and character could
think of acquiring the crown to his family, and of de∣posing
Henry by foreign force, and together with him,
Margaret, his patron, a princess of so much spirit and
penetration. Suffolk appealed to many noblemen in the
house, who knew, that he had intended to marry his son
to one of the co-heirs of the earl of Warwic, and was
disappointed in his design only by the death of that lady:
And he observed, that Margaret of Somerset could bring
to her husband no title to the crown; because she her∣self
was not so much as comprehended in the entail,
settled by act of parliament. It is easy to account for
the loss of Normandy and Guienne from the situation
of affairs in the two kingdoms, without supposing any
treachery in the English ministers; and it may safely
be affirmed, that greater vigour of council was requisite to
defend them from the arms of Charles VII. than to con∣quer
them at first from his predecessor. It could never
be the interest of any English minister to betray and
abandon these provinces; much less of one, who was
so well established in his master's favour, who enjoyed
such high honours and ample possessions in his own
country, who had nothing to dread but the effects of po∣pular
hatred, and who could never think, without the
most extreme reluctance, of becoming a fugitive and
exile in a foreign land. The only article, which car∣ries
any face of probability, is his engagement for the
delivery of Maine to Charles of Anjou; but Suffolk
maintained, with great appearance of truth, that this
measure was known and consented to by several at the
<PB N="194" REF="208"/>
council board<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 643.</NOTE>; and it seems hard to ascribe to it, as
is done by the parliament, the subsequent loss of Nor∣mandy
and expulsion of the English. Normandy lay
open on every side to the invasion of the French: Maine,
an inland province, must soon after have fallen without
any attack: And as the English possessed in other parts
more fortresses than they could garrison or provide for,
it seemed no bad policy to contract their force, and to
render the defence practicable, by reducing it into
smaller compass.</P>
<P>THE commons were probably sensible, that this charge
of treason against Suffolk would not bear a strict scrutiny;
and they therefore sent up, soon after, a new charge of
misdemeanors, which they also divided into several ar∣ticles.
They affirmed, among other imputations, that
he had procured exorbitant grants from the crown, had
embezzled the public money, had conferred offices on
improper persons, had perverted justice by maintaining
iniquitous causes, and had procured pardons to notorious
offenders<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 643.</NOTE>. The articles are mostly general; but are
not improbable: And as Suffolk seems to have been a
bad man and a bad minister, it will not be rash in us
to think, that he was guilty, and that many of these
articles could have been proved against him. The court
was alarmed at the prosecution of a favourite minister,
who lay under such a load of popular prejudices; and an
expedient was fallen upon to save him from present ruin.
The King sent for all the lords, spiritual and temporal,
to his apartment: The prisoner was produced before
them, and asked what he could say in his own defence:
He denied the charge; but submitted to the King's
mercy: Henry expressed himself not to be satisfied with
regard to the first bill of treasons; but in consideration of
the second of misdemeanors, he declared, that, by virtue
<PB N="195" REF="209"/>
of Suffolk's own submission, not by any judicial autho∣rity,
he banished him the kingdom, during five years.
The lords remained silent; but so soon as they returned
to their own house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His banish∣ment,</NOTE> they entered a protest, that this
sentence should nowise infringe their privileges, and that
if Suffolk had insisted upon his right, and had not sub∣mitted
voluntarily to the King's orders, he was intitled
to a trial by his peers in parliament.</P>
<P>IT was easy to see, that these irregular proceedings
were meant to favour Suffolk, and that, as he still pos∣sessed
the Queen's confidence, he would, on the first fa∣vourable
opportunity, be restored to his country, and be
re-instated in his former power and credit. A captain of
a vessel was therefore employed by his enemies to inter∣cept
him in his passage to France: He was seized near
Dover;<NOTE PLACE="marg">and death.</NOTE> his head struck off on the side of a long boat,
and his body thrown into the sea<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 158. Hist. Croyland. contin. p. 525. Stowe, p. 388. Grafton, p. 610.</NOTE>. No enquiry was
made after the authors and accomplices of this atrocious
act of violence.</P>
<P>THE duke of Somerset succeeded to Suffolk's power in
the ministry, and credit with the Queen; and as he was the
person, in whose hands the French provinces were lost,
the public, who judge always by the event, soon made
him equally the object of their animosity and hatred.
The duke of York was absent in Ireland during all these
transactions; and however it might be suspected, that
his partizans had excited and supported the prosecution
of Suffolk, no immediate ground of complaint could, on
that account, lie against him. But there happened soon
after an incident, which rouzed the jealousy of the court,
and discovered to them the extreme danger, to which
<PB N="196" REF="210"/>
they were exposed from the pretensions of that wise and
popular prince.</P>
<P>THE humours of the people, set afloat by the
parliamentary impeachment, and by the fall of so great
a favourite as Suffolk, broke out in various commo∣tions,
which were soon suppressed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Popular in∣surrection.</NOTE> but there arose one
in Kent, which was likely to have been attended with
more dangerous consequences. A man of low condi∣tion,
one John Cade, a native of Ireland, who had been
obliged to fly into France for his crimes, observed on his
return the discontents of the people; and he laid on them
the foundation of projects, which were at first attended
with surprising success. Me took the name of John Mor∣timer,
intending, as is supposed, to pass himself for a
son of that Sir John Mortimer, who had been sentenced
to death by parliament, and executed in the begin∣ning
of this reign, without any trial or evidence,
merely upon an indictment of high treason, given in
against him<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 364. Cotton, p. 564. This author admires, that such a piece of injustice should have been committed in peaceable times: He might have added, and by such virtuous princes as Bedford and Glocester. But it is to be presumed, that Mortimer was guilty; tho' his condemnation was highly irregular and illegal. The people had at this time a very feeble sense of law and a constitution; and power was
very imperfectly restrained by these limits. When the proceedings of a parliament were so irregular, it is easy to imagine, that those of a king would be more so.</NOTE>. On the first mention of that popular
name, the common people of Kent, to the number of
20,000, flocked to Cade's standard; and he excited
their zeal, by publishing complaints against the nume∣rous
abuses of government, and demanding redress of
their grievances. The court, not yet fully sensible of
the danger, sent a small force against the rioters, under
the command of Sir Humphrey Stafford, who was de∣feated
<PB N="197" REF="211"/>
and slain in an action near Sevenoke<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 159. Holingshed, p. 634.</NOTE>; and Cade,
advancing with his followers towards London, encamped
on Black-heath. Tho' elated by his victory, he still
maintained the appearance of moderation; and sending
the court a very plausible list of grievances<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 388, 389. Holingshed, p. 633.</NOTE>, he pro∣mised,
that when these were redressed, and when lord
Say, the treasurer, and Cromer, high sheriff of Kent,
were punished for their malversations, he would imme∣diately
lay down his arms. The council, who observed,
that nobody was willing to fight against men so reason∣able
in their pretensions, carried the King, for present
safety, to Kenilworth; and the city immediately opened
their gates to Cade, who maintained, during some time,
great order and discipline among his followers. He al∣ways
led them out into the fields during the night-time;
and published severe edicts against plunder and violence of
every kind: But being obliged, in order to gratify their
malevolence against Say and Cromer, to put these mi∣nisters
to death without a legal trial<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 612.</NOTE>; he found, that,
after the commission of this crime, he was no longer
master of their riotous disposition, and that all his orders
were neglected<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 160.</NOTE>. They broke into a rich house, which
they plundered; and the citizens, alarmed with this act
of violence, shut their gates against them, and being
seconded by a detachment of soldiers, sent them by lord
Scales, governor of the tower, they repulsed the rebels
with great slaughter<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hist. Croyl. contin. p. 526.</NOTE>. The Kentishmen were so dis∣couraged
with this blow, that, upon receiving a general
pardon from the primate then chancellor, they retreated
towards Rochester, and then dispersed. The pardon
was soon after annulled, as being extorted by violence:
A price was set on Cade's head<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xi. p. 275.</NOTE>, who was killed by one
<PB N="198" REF="212"/>
Iden, a gentleman of Sussex; and many of his followers
were capitally punished for their rebellion.</P>
<P>IT was imagined by the court, that the duke of York
had secretly instigated Cade to this attempt, in order to
make an experiment of the dispositions of the people
towards his title and family<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 661. Stowe, p, 391.</NOTE>: And as the trial had suc∣ceeded
to his wish, the ruling party had greater reason
than ever to apprehend the future consequences of his
pretensions. At the same time, they heard that he in∣tended
to return from Ireland; and fearing, that he meant
to bring an armed force along with him, they issued or∣ders,
in the King's name, for opposing him, and for re∣fusing
him access into England<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 394.</NOTE>. But the duke dis∣armed
his enemies by coming attended with no more
than his ordinary retinue: The precautions of the mi∣nisters
served only to shew him their jealousy and ma∣lignity
against him: He was sensible, that his title, by
being dangerous to the King, was also become dangerous
to himself: He now saw the impossibility of remaining
in his present situation, and the necessity of proceeding
forward in support of his claim. His partizans, there∣fore,
were instructed to maintain in all companies, his
right by succession, and by the established laws and con∣stitution
of the kingdom: These questions became every
day more and more the subject of conversation: The
minds of men were insensibly sharpened against each
other by disputes, before they came to more dangerous
extremities: And various topics were pleaded in support
of the pretensions of each party.</P>
<P>THE partizans of the house of Lancaster maintained,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The parties of Lanca∣ster and York.</NOTE>
that tho' the exaltation of Henry IV. might at first be
deemed somewhat irregular, and could not be justified
<PB N="199" REF="213"/>
by any of those principles, on which that prince chose
to rest his title, it was yet founded on general consent,
was a national act, and was derived from the voluntary
approbation of a free people, who, being loosened from
their allegiance by the tyranny of the preceding govern∣ment,
were moved by gratitude, as well as by a sense of
public interest, to commit the sceptre into the hands of their
deliverer: That even if that establishment were allowed
to be at first invalid, it had acquired solidity by time, the
only principle which ultimately gives authority to go∣vernment,
and removes those scruples, which the ire∣gular
steps, attending almost all revolutions, naturally
excite in the minds of the people: That the right of
succession was a rule admitted only for general good, and
for the maintenance of public order; and could never
be pleaded to the overthrow of national tranquillity, and
the subversion of regular establishments: That the prin∣ciples
of liberty, no less than the maxims of internal
peace, were injured by these pretensions of the house of
York; and if so many re-iterated acts of the legislature,
by which the crown was entailed on the present family,
were now invalidated, the English nation must be con∣sidered,
not as a free people who could dispose of their
own government, but as a troop of slaves, who were
implicitly transmitted by succession from one hand to an∣other:
That the nation was bound to allegiance under
the house of Lancaster by moral, no less than by
political duty; and were they to infringe those numerous
oaths of fealty, which they had sworn to Henry and his
predecessors, they would thenceforth be so thrown loose
from all principles, that it would be found difficult ever
after to fix and restrain them: That the duke of York
himself had frequently done homage to the King as his
lawful sovereign, and had thereby, in the most solemn
manner, made an indirect renunciation of those claims,
<PB N="200" REF="214"/>
with which he now dared to disturb the tranquillity of the
public: That even tho' the violation of the rights of
blood, made on the deposition of Richard, was perhaps
rash and imprudent, it was now too late to remedy the
mischief; the danger of a disputed succession could no
longer be obviated; the people, accustomed to a govern∣ment,
which, in the hands of the late King, had been
so glorious, and in that of his predecessor, so prudent
and salutary, would still ascribe a right to it; by causing
multiplied disorders, and by shedding an inundation of
blood, the advantage would only be obtained, of exchang∣ing
one pretender for another; and the house of York
itself, if established on the throne, would, on the first
opportunity, be exposed to those revolutions, which the
giddy spirit, excited in the people, gave so much reason
to apprehend: And that tho' the present King enjoyed not
the shining talents, which had appeared in his father and
grandfather, he might still have a son, who should be
endowed with them; he was himself eminent for the
most harmless and inoffensive manners; and if active
princes were dethroned on pretence of tyranny, and in∣dolent
ones on the plea of incapacity, there would thence∣forth
remain in the constitution no settled and established
rule of obedience to any sovereign.</P>
<P>THESE strong topics in favour of the house of Lan∣caster,
were opposed by arguments no less convincing
on the side of the house of York. The partizans of this
latter family asserted, that the maintenance of order in
the succession of princes, so far from incroaching on the
rights of the people, or invalidating their fundamental
title to good government, was established only for the
purposes of government, and served to prevent those
numberless confusions, which must ensue, if no rule was
followed but the uncertain and disputed views of present
convenience and advantage: That the same maxims,
<PB N="201" REF="215"/>
which ensured the public peace, were also salutary to
national liberty; the privileges of the people could only
be maintained by the observance of laws; and if no
account was made of the rights of the sovereign, it could
less be expected, that any regard would be paid to the
property and freedom of the subject: That it was never
too late to correct any pernicious precedent; an unjust
establishment, the longer it stood, acquired the greater
sanction and validity; it could, with more appearance
of reason, be pleaded as an authority for a like injustice;
and the maintenance of it, instead of favouring public
tranquillity, tended to disjoint every principle by which
human society was supported: That usurpers would be
happy, if their present possession of power, or their con∣tinuance
for a few years, could convert them into legal
princes; but nothing would be more miserable than the
people, if all restraints on violence and ambition were
thus removed, and a full scope given to the attempts of
every turbulent innovator: That time indeed bestowed
a solidity on government, whose first foundation was the
most infirm; but it required a long course of time to
operate this effect, and the total extinction of those clai∣mants,
whose title was built on the original principles
of the constitution: That the deposition of Richard, and
the advancement of Henry IV. were not deliberate na∣tional
acts; but the result of the levity and violence of
the people, and proceeded from those very defects in hu∣man
nature, which the establishment of political society,
and of an order in succession, was calculated to prevent:
That the subsequent entails of the crown were a con∣tinuance
of the same violence and usurpation; they were
not ratified by the legislature, since the consent of the
rightful King was still wanting; and the acquiescence,
first of the family of Mortimer, then of the family of
York, proceeded from present necessity, and implied no
renunciation of their pretensions: That the restoration
<PB N="202" REF="216"/>
of that order of succession, could not be considered as a
changes, which familiarized the people to revolutions; but
as a correction of former changes, which had itself en∣couraged
the giddy spirit of innovation, rebellion, and
disobedience: And that as the original title of Lancaster
stood only, in the person of Henry IV. on present con∣venience,
even this principle, unjustifiable as it was, when
not supported by laws, and warranted by the constitution,
had now entirely gone over to the other side; nor was
there any comparison between a prince utterly unable to
sway the scepter, and governed entirely by corrupt mini∣sters,
or by an imperious Queen, engaged in foreign and
hostile interests; and a prince of mature years, of ap∣proved
wisdom and experience, a native of England, the
lineal heir of the crown, who by his restoration would
replace every thing on their antient foundations.</P>
<P>So many plausible arguments could be urged on both
sides of this interesting question, that the people were
extremely divided in their sentiments; and tho' the
noblemen of greatest power and influence seem to have
embraced the party of York, the opposite cause had the
advantage of being supported by the present laws, and
by the immediate possession of royal authority. There
were also many great noblemen of the Lancastrian party,
who balanced the power of their antagonists; and kept
the nation in suspence between them. The earl of
Northumberland adhered to the present government:
The earl of Westmoreland, in spite of his connections
with the duke of York, and with the family of Nevil,
of which he was the head, was brought over to the
same party; and the whole north of England, the most
warlike part of the kingdom, was, by means of these
two potent noblemen, engaged warmly in the interests
of Lancaster. Edmund Beau<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort, duke of Somerset,
and his brother Henry, were great supports of that
cause; as were also Henry Holland, duke of Exeter,
<PB N="203" REF="217"/>
Stafford, duke of Buckingham, the earl of Shrewsbury,
the lords Clifford, Dudley, Scales, Audley, and other
noblemen.</P>
<P>WHILE the kingdom was in this situation, it might
naturally be expected, that so many turbulent barons,
possessed of co much independant authority, would im∣mediately
have flown to arms, and have decided the quar∣rel,
after their usual manner, by war and battle, under
the standard of the contending princes. But there were
still many causes, which retarded these desperate extremi∣ties,
and made a long train of faction, intrigue and ca∣bal,
precede the military operations. By the gradual
progress of arts in England, as well as in other parts of Eu∣rope,
the people were now become of some consequence;
laws were beginning to be respected by them; and it
was requisite, by various pretences, previously to recon∣cile
their minds to the overthrow of such an antient esta∣blishment
as that of the house of Lancaster, ere their
concurrence could reasonably be expected. The duke
of York himself, the new claimant, was of a very mo∣derate
and cautious character, an enemy to violence,
and inclined to trust rather to time and policy, than to
sanguinary measures, for the success of his pretensions.
The very imbecillity itself of Henry tended to keep the
factions in suspence, and make them stand long in awe
of each other: It rendered the Lancastrian party unable
to strike any violent blow against their enemies; it en∣couraged
the Yorkists to hope, that, after banishing the
King's ministers, and getting possession of his person,
they might gradually undermine his authority, and be
able, without the perilous experiment of a civil war,
to change the succession, by parliamentary and legal au∣thority.</P>
<P>THE disposition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1451.</NOTE> which appeared in a parliament, assem∣bled
soon after the arrival of the duke of York from Ireland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th Nov.</NOTE>
<PB N="204" REF="218"/>
favoured these expectations, and both discovered an unusual
boldness in the commons, and were a proof of the gene∣ral
discontents which prevailed against the administration.
The lower house, without any previous enquiry or exa∣mination,
without alledging any other cause than common
fame, ventured to present an address against the
duke of Somerset, the dutchess of Suffolk, the bishop of
Chester, Sir John Sutton lord Dudley, and several others
of inferior rank; and they prayed the King to remove
them for ever from his person and councils, and to pro∣hibit
them from approaching within twelve miles of the
court<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Parliamentary History, vol. ii. p. 263.</NOTE>. This was a violent attack, somewhat arbitrary,
and supported but by few precedents, against the ministry;
yet the King durst not entirely and openly oppose it: He
replied, that, except the lords, he would banish all the
others from court during a year, unless he had occasion
for their assistance in suppressing any rebellion. At the
same time, he rejected a bill, which had passed both hou∣ses
for attainting the late duke of Suffolk, and which dis∣covered
a very general prejudice against the measures of
the court.</P>
<P>THE duke of York,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1452.</NOTE> trusting to these symptoms,
raised an army of 10,000 men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first armament of the duke of York.</NOTE> with which he marched
towards London; demanding a reformation of the go∣vernment,
and the removal of the duke of Somerset
from all his power and authority<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 394.</NOTE>. He found unex∣pectedly
the gates of the city shut against him; and
on his retreating into Kent, he was followed by the
King at the head of a superior army; in which several
of Richard's friends, particularly Salisbury and Warwic
appeared; probably with a view of mediating between
the parties, and of seconding, on occasion, the duke of
<PB N="205" REF="219"/>
York's pretensions. A parley ensued; Richard still in∣sisted
upon the removal of Somerset, and his submitting
to a trial in parliament: The court pretended to com∣ply
with his demand; and that nobleman was put under
arrest: The duke of York was then persuaded to pay
his respects to the King in his tent; and on repeating
his charge against the duke of Somerset, he was sur∣prized
to see that minister step from behind the curtain,
and offer to justify his innocence. Richard now found,
that he was betrayed; that he was in the hands of his
enemies; and that it was become necessary, for his own
safety, to lower his pretensions. No violence, however,
was attempted against him: The nation was not in a
disposition to bear the destruction of so popular a prince:
He had many friends in Henry's army: And his son,
who was not in the power of the court, might still be
able to revenge his death on all his enemies: He was
therefore dismissed; and he retired to his seat at Wigmore
on the borders of Wales<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 620.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE the duke of York lived in this retreat, there
happened an incident, which, by encreasing the public
discontents, proved favourable to his hopes. Several
Gascon lords, affectionate to the English government,
and disgusted with the new dominion of the French,
came to London, and offered to return to their allegiance
under Henry<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hollingshed, p. 640.</NOTE>. The earl of Shrewsbury, with a body
of 8000 men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1453.</NOTE> was sent over to support them. Bour∣deaux
opened its gates to him:<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th July</NOTE> He made himself master
of Fronsac, Castillon, and some other places: His affairs
bore for some time a prosperous aspect: But as King
Charles hastened to resist this dangerous invasion, the
fortunes of the English were then reversed; Shrewsbury,
a venerable warrior above eighty years of age, was kill∣ed
in battle; his conquests were lost; Bourdeaux was

again obliged to submit to the French King<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Polyd. Virg. p. 501. Grafton, p. 623.</NOTE>; and all
hopes of recovering that province were for ever extin∣guished.</P>
<P>THO' the English might deem themselves happy to be
fairly rid of distant dominions, which were of no use to
them, and which they never could defend against the
growing power of France; they expressed great discon∣tent
on this occasion; and they threw all the blame on
the ministry, who had not been able to effect impossibi∣lities.
While they were in this disposition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13 October.</NOTE> the birth of
a son to Henry, who was baptized under the name of
Edward, was deemed no joyful incident; and as it re∣moved
all hopes of the peaceable succession of the duke
of York, who was otherwise, in the right of his father,
and by the laws enacted since the accession of the house
of Lancaster, next heir to the crown, it had rather a
tendency to inflame the quarrel between the parties.
But the duke was incapable of violent councils; and
even when no visible obstacle lay between him and
the throne, he was prevented by his own scruples from
mounting it. Henry, always unfit to exercise the go∣vernment,
fell at this time into a distemper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1454.</NOTE> which so
far encreased his natural imbecillity, that it rendered
him incapable of maintaining even the appearance of
royalty. The Queen and the council, destitute of this
support, found themselves unable to resist the York party;
and they were obliged to yield to the torrent. They sent
Somerset to the Tower; and appointed Richard lieu∣tenant
of the kingdom, with powers to open and hold a
session of parliament<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xi. p. 344.</NOTE>. That assembly also, taking
into consideration the state of the kingdom, created him
protector during pleasure. Men, who thus entrusted
royal authority to one, who had such evident and strong
<PB N="207" REF="221"/>
pretensions to the crown, were not surely averse to his
taking immediate and full possession of it. Yet the duke,
instead of pushing them to make farther concessions,
appeared somewhat timid and irresolute even in receiving
that power which was tendered to him. He desired, that
it might be recorded in parliament, that this authority
was conferred on him of their own free motion, with∣out
any application on his part: He expressed his hopes,
that they would assist him in the exercise of it: He
made it a condition of his acceptance, that the other
lords, who were appointed to be of his council, should
also accept of that trust, and should exercise it: And
he required, that all the powers of his office should be
specified and defined by act of parliament. This mo∣deration
of Richard was certainly very unusual and very
amiable; but it was attended with bad consequences in
the present state of affairs, and by giving time for the
animosities of faction to arise and ferment, it proved the
source of all those furious wars and commotions, which
ensued.</P>
<P>THE enemies of the duke of York soon found it
in their power to make advantage of his excessive caution.
Henry having so far recovered from his distemper, as
to carry the appearance of exercising the royal power;
they moved him to resume his authority, to annul the
regency of the duke, to release Somerset from the
Tower<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xi. p. 361. Hollingshed, p. 642. Grafton, p. 626.</NOTE>, and to commit the administration into the
hands of that nobleman.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1455.</NOTE> Richard, sensible of the dan∣gers,
which might attend his former acceptance of the
parliamentary commission, should he submit to the an∣nulling
of it, levied an army; but still without ad∣vancing
any pretensions to the crown. He complained
only of the King's ministers, and demanded a reforma∣tion
<PB N="208" REF="222"/>
of the government. A battle was fought at St.
Albans, in which the Yorkists were superior, and with∣out
suffering any loss on their side, slew above 5000 of
their enemies;<NOTE PLACE="marg">First battle of St. Al∣bans.</NOTE> among whom were the duke of Somer∣set,
the earl of Northumberland, the earl of Stafford,
eldest son to the duke of Buckingham,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d May.</NOTE> lord Clifford, and
many other persons of distinction<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 399. Hollingshed, p. 643.</NOTE>. The King him∣self
fell into the hands of the duke of York, who treated
him with great respect and tenderness: He was only
obliged (which he regarded as no hardship) to commit
the whole authority of the crown into the hands of his
rival.</P>
<P>THIS was the first blood spilt in that fatal quarrel,
which was not finished in less than a course of thirty
years, which was signalized by twelve pitched battles,
which opened a scene of extraordinary fierceness and
cruelty, is computed to have cost the lives of eighty
princes of the blood, and almost entirely annihilated the
antient nobility of England. The strong attachments,
which, at that time, men of the same kindred bore to
each other, and the vindictive spirit which was considered
as a point of honour, rendered the great families impla∣cable
in their resentments, and widened every moment
the breach between the parties. Yet affairs did not im∣mediately
proceed to the last extremities: The nation
was kept for some time in suspense: The vigour and
spirit of Queen Margaret, supporting her small power,
still proved a balance to the great authority of Richard,
which was checked by his irresolute temper. A parlia∣ment,
which was soon after assembled, discovered plainly
by the contrariety of their proceedings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th July.</NOTE> the contrariety
of the motives by which they were actuated. They
granted the Yorkists a general indemnity; and they re∣stored
the protectorship to the duke, who in accepting it,
<PB N="209" REF="223"/>
still persevered in all his former precautions: But at the
same time, they renewed their oaths of fealty to Henry,
and fixed the continuance of the protectorship to the
majority of his eldest son Edward, who was vested in
the usual dignities of prince of Wales, duke of Corn∣wal,
and earl of Chester. The only decisive act, passed
by this parliament, was a full resumption of all the
grants, which had been made since the death of Henry V.
and which had reduced the crown to the most scandalous
poverty.</P>
<P>IT was not found difficult to wrest power from hands
so little tenacious as those of the duke of York.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1456.</NOTE> Mar∣garet,
availing herself of that prince's absence, pro∣duced
her husband before the house of lords; and as his
state of health permitted him at that time to act his part
with some tolerable decency, he declared his intentions
to resume the government, and to put an end to Richard's
authority. This measure, being unexpected, was not
opposed by the contrary party: The house of lords, who
were many of them disgusted with the late act of re∣sumption,
assented to Henry's proposal: And the King
was accordingly declared to be reinstated in his sovereign
authority. The duke of York even acquiesced in this
irregular act of the peers; and no disturbance ensued.
But that prince's claim to the crown was too well known,
and the steps, which he had taken to promote it, were
too evident, ever to allow sincere trust and confidence to
have place between the parties.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1457.</NOTE> The court retired to
Coventry, and invited the duke of York and the earls of
Salisbury and Warwic to attend the King's person. As
they were on the road, they received intelligence, that
designs were formed by their enemies against their liber∣ties
and lives. They immediately separated themselves:
Richard withdrew to his castle of Wigmore in the county
<PB N="210" REF="224"/>
of Hereford: Salisbury to Middleham in Yorkshire:
And Warwic to his government of Calais, which had
been committed to him after the battle of St. Albans,
and which, as it gave him the command of the only
regular military force maintained by England, was of
the utmost importance in the present juncture. Still,
men of peaceable dispositions, and among the rest Bour∣chier,
archbishop of Canterbury, thought it not too
late to interpose with their good offices, in order to pre∣vent
that effusion of blood, with which the kingdom
was threatened; and the awe, in which each party stood
of the other, rendered their mediation for some time suc∣cessful.
It was agreed, that all the great leaders on both
sides should meet in London, and be solemnly reconciled.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1458.</NOTE>
The duke of York and his partizans came thither with
numerous retinues, and took up their quarters near each
other for mutual security. The chieftains of the Lan∣castrian
party used the same precaution. The mayor, at
the head of 5000 men, kept a strict guard, night and
day; and was extremely vigilant in maintaining peace
between them<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Fabian Chron. anno 1458. The author says, that some lords brought 900 retainers, some 600, none less than 400. See also Graf∣ton, p. 633.</NOTE>. Terms were adjusted, which took not
away the ground of difference. An outward reconcilia∣tion
only was procured: And in order to notify this ac∣cord
to the whole people, a solemn procession to St.
Paul's was appointed, where the duke of York led
Queen Margaret, and a chieftain of one party marched
hand in hand with a chieftain of the opposite<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Hollingshed, p. 648. Polyd. Virg. p. 506. Grafton, p. 634.</NOTE>. The less
real cordiality prevailed, the more were the exterior de∣monstrations
of friendship and amity redoubled. But it
was evident to all men of sense, that a contest for a
crown could not thus be peaceably accommodated; that
<PB N="211" REF="225"/>
each party only watched for an opportunity of subvert∣ing
the other; and that much blood must yet be spilt,
ere the nation could be restored to perfect tranquillity, or
enjoy a settled and established government.</P>
<P>EVEN the smallest accident,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1459.</NOTE> without any formed de∣sign,
was sufficient, in the present disposition of mens
minds, to dissolve the seeming amity between the parties;
and had the intentions of the leaders been ever so ami∣cable,
they would have found it difficult to restrain the animosity
of their followers. One of the King's reti∣nue
insulted one of the earl of Warwic's: Their com∣panions
on each side took part in the quarrel: A fierce
combat ensued: The earl apprehended his life to be
aimed at: He fled over to his government at Calais<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Crafton, p. 635.</NOTE>;
and both parties, in every county of England, openly
made preparations for deciding the contest by war and
arms.</P>
<P>THE earl of Salisbury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Blore-heath.</NOTE> marching to join the duke of
York, was overtaken, at Blore-heath on the borders of
Staffordshire, by lord Audley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d Sept.</NOTE> who commanded much
superior forces; and a small rivulet with steep bank<SUP>s</SUP>
ran between the two armies. Salisbury here supplied his
defect in numbers by stratagem; a refinement, of which
there occur few instances in the English civil wars,
where a headlong courage, more than military conduct,
is commonly to be remarked. He feigned a retreat,
and allured Audley to follow him with precipitation: But
when part of the royal army had passed the brook, Salis∣bury
suddenly turned upon them; and partly by the
surprize, partly by the division of the enemies forces,
put them to rout: The example of flight was followed
by the rest of the army: And Salisbury, obtaining a
<PB N="212" REF="226"/>
complete victory, reached the general rendezvous of the
Yorkists at Ludlow<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hollingshed, p. 649. Grafton, p. 936.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE earl of Warwic brought over to this rendezvous a
choice body of veterans from Calais, on whom, it was
thought, the fortune of the war would much depend;
but this reinforcement proved, in the issue, the ruin of
the duke of York's party. When the royal army ap∣proached,
and a general action was every hour expected,
Sir Andrew Trollop, who commanded the veterans, de∣serted
to the King in the night-time; and the York∣ists
were so dismayed by this instance of treachery,
which made every man apprehensive of his fellow, that
they separated next day without striking a stroke<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hollingshed, p. 650. Grafton, p. 537.</NOTE>: The
duke of York fled to Ireland: The earl of Warwic,
attended by many of the other leaders, escaped to his
government of Calais; where his great popularity among
all orders of men in the kingdom, particularly among
the military, soon drew to him partizans, and rendered
his power very formidable. The friends of the house
of York in England kept themselves every where in
readiness to rise on the first summons from their leaders.</P>
<P>AFTER meeting with some successes at sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1460.</NOTE> War∣wic
landed in Kent, with the earl of Salisbury, and the
earl of Marche, eldest son to the duke of York; and
being met by the primate, the lord Cobham, and other
persons of distinction, he marched, amidst the acclama∣tions
of the people, to London. The city immediately
opened its gates to him; and his troops encreasing on
every day's march, he soon found himself in a condi∣tion
to face the royal army, which hastened from Co∣ventry
to attack him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Northamp∣ton.</NOTE> The battle was fought at North∣ampton;<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th July.</NOTE>
and was soon decided against the royalists by
<PB N="213" REF="227"/>
the infidelity of lord Grey of Ruthin, who, commanding
Henry's vanguard, deserted to the enemy during the
heat of action, and spread a consternation thro' the
troops. The duke of Buckingham, the earl of Shrews∣bury,
the lords Beaumont and Egremont, and Sir Wil∣liam
Lucie were killed in the action or pursuit: The
slaughter fell chiefly on the gentry and nobility; the
common people were spared by orders of the earls of
Warwic and Marche<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 409.</NOTE>. Henry himself, that empty sha∣dow
of a King, was again taken prisoner; and as the
innocence and simplicity of his manners, which bore the
appearance of sanctity, had procured him the tender re∣gard
of the people<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 169. Grafton, p. 595.</NOTE>, the earl of Warwic and the other
leaders took care to distinguish themselves by their respect∣ful
demeanour towards him.</P>
<P>A PARLIAMENT was summoned in the King's name,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A parlia∣ment.</NOTE>
and met at Westminster;<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th Oct.</NOTE> where the duke of York soon
after appeared from Ireland. This prince had never hi∣therto
advanced openly any claim to the crown: He had
only complained of ill ministers, and demanded a redress
of grievances: And even in the present crisis, when the
parliament was surrounded by his victorious army, he
showed such a regard to law and liberty, as is very unusual
during the prevalence of a party in any civil dissensions;
and was still less to be expected, in those violent and li∣centious
times. He advanced towards the throne; and
being met by the archbishop of Canterbury, who asked
him, whether he had yet paid his respects to the King?
he replied, that he knew of none to whom he owed that
title. He then stood near the throne<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Hollingshed, p. 655.</NOTE>, and addressing
himself to the house of peers, he gave them a deduction
of his title by descent, mentioned the cruelties by which
the house of Lancaster had paved at first their way to so∣vereign
<PB N="214" REF="228"/>
power, insisted on the calamities which had at∣tended
the government of Henry, exhorted them to re∣turn
into the right path, by doing justice to the lineal
successor, and thus pleaded his cause before them as his
natural and lawful judges<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 665. Grafton, p. 643.</NOTE>. This cool and moderate
manner of demanding a crown, intimidated his friends
and encouraged his enemies: The lords remained in
suspence<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Hollingshed, p. 657. Grafton, p. 645.</NOTE>; and no one ventured to utter a word on this
occasion. Richard, who had probably expected, that
the peers would have invited him to place himself on the
throne, was much disappointed at their silence; but de∣siring
them to reflect on what he had proposed to them,
he departed the house. The peers took the matter under
consideration, with as great tranquillity as if it had been
a common subject of debate: They desired the assistance
of some considerable members among the commons in
their deliberations: They heard, in several successive
days, the reasons alledged for the duke of York: They
even ventured to propose objections to his claim, founded
on former entails of the crown, and on the oaths of
fealty sworn to the house of Lancaster<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 666.</NOTE>: They also
observed, that, as Richard had all along born the arms
of York, not those of Clarence, he could not claim as
successor to the latter family: And after receiving an∣swers
to these objections, derived from the violence and
power by which the house of Lancaster supported their
present possession of the crown; they ventured at last
to pronounce a decision. Their sentence was calculated,
as far as possible, to please both parties: They declared
the title of the duke of York to be certain and inde∣feasible;
but in consideration, that Henry had enjoyed
the crown, without dispute or controversy, during the
course of thirty-eight years, they determined that he
<PB N="215" REF="229"/>
should continue to possess the title and dignity during
the remainder of his life; that the administration of the
government, meanwhile, should remain with Richard,
that he should be acknowledged the true and lawful heir
of the monarchy, that every one should swear to main∣tain
his succession, that it should be treason to attempt
his life, and that all former settlements of the crown, in
this and the two last reigns, should be abrogated and
rescinded<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 666. Grafton, p. 647.</NOTE>. The duke of York acquiesced in this deci∣sion:
Henry himself, being a prisoner, could not oppose
it: Even if he had enjoyed his liberty, he would not
probably have felt any violent reluctance against it: And
the act thus passed with the unanimous consent of the
whole legislative body. Tho' the mildness of this com∣promise
is chiefly to be ascribed to the moderation of
the duke of York, it is impossible not to observe in
those transactions visible marks of a higher regard to law,
and a more fixed authority, enjoyed by parliament, than
has appeared in any former period of English history.</P>
<P>IT is probable, that the duke of York, without em∣ploying
either menaces or violence, could have obtained
from the commons a settlement more consistent and uni∣form:
But as many, if not all the members of, the upper
house, had received grants, concessions, or dignities,
during the last sixty years, when the house of Lancaster
was possessed of the government, they were afraid of in∣validating
their own titles by too sudden and violent an
overthrow of that family; and in thus temporizing be∣tween
the parties, they fixed the throne on a basis, upon
which it could not possibly stand. The duke, appre∣hending
his chief danger to arise from the genius and
spirit of Queen Margaret, sought a pretence for banish∣ing
her entirely the kingdom; and for that purpose, he
<PB N="216" REF="230"/>
sent her, in the King's name, a summons to come imme∣diately
to London; intending, in case of her disobedience,
to proceed to extremities against her. But the queen
needed not this menace to excite her activity in behalf
of the rights of her family. After the defeat at North∣ampton,
she had fled with her infant son to Durham,
and from thence to Scotland; but soon returning, she
applied to the northern barons, and employed every mo∣tive
to procure their assistance. Her affability, insinua∣tion,
and address, qualities in which she excelled; her
caresses, her promises wrought a powerful effect on every
one who approached her: The admiration of her great
qualities was succeeded by compassion towards her help∣less
condition: The nobility of that quarter, who re∣garded
themselves as the most warlike of the kingdom,
were moved by indignation to find the southern barons
dispose of the crown and settle the government: And
that they might allure the people to their standard, they
promised them the spoils of all the provinces on the other
side the Trent. By these means, the Queen had collect∣ed
an army twenty thousand strong, with a celerity
which was neither expected by her friends, nor appre∣hended
by her enemies.</P>
<P>THE duke of York, informed of her appearance in
the north, hastened thither with a body of 5000 men,
to suppress, as he imagined, the beginnings of an insur∣rection;
when, on his arrival at Wakefield, he found
himself so much out-numbered by his enemies. He threw
himself into Sandal castle, which was situated in the
neighbourhood; and he was advised by the earl of Sa∣lisbury,
and other prudent counsellors, to remain in that
fortress, till his son, the earl of Marche, who was levy∣ing
forces in the borders of Wales, could advance to his
assistance<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 412.</NOTE>. But the duke, tho' deficient in political
<PB N="217" REF="231"/>
courage, possessed personal bravery to an eminent degree;
and notwithstanding all his wisdom and experience, he
thought, that he should be forever disgraced, if, by
taking shelter behind walls, he should for a moment re∣sign
the victory to a woman.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Wakefield. 24th Dec.</NOTE> He descended into the
plain, and offered battle to the enemy, which was in
stantly accepted. The great inequality of number was
sufficient alone to decide the victory; but the Queen,
by sending a detachment, who fell on the back of the
duke's army, rendered her advantage still more certain
and undisputed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the Duke of York.</NOTE> The duke himself was killed in the
action; and as his body was found among the slain, the
head was cut off by Margaret's orders, and fixed on
the gates of York, with a paper crown upon it, in de∣rision
of his pretended title. His son, the earl of Rut∣land,
a youth of seventeen, was brought to lord Clifford;
and that barbarian, in revenge of his father's death, who
had perished in the battle of St. Alban's, murdered,
in cold blood, and with his own hands, this innocent
prince, whose exterior figure, as well as other accom∣plishments,
are represented by historians as extremely
amiable. The earl of Salisbury was wounded and taken
prisoner, and immediately beheaded, with several other
persons of distinction, by martial law at Pomfret<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Polyd. Virg. P. 510.</NOTE>. There fell near three thousand of the Yorkists in this
battle: The duke himself was greatly and justly lament∣ed
by his own party; a prince who surely merited a
better fate, and whose errors in conduct proceeded en∣tirely
from such qualities, as render him the more an ob∣ject
of esteem and affection. He perished in the fiftieth
year of his age, and left behind him three sons, Edward,
George, and Richard, with three daughters, Anne, Eli∣zabeth,
and Margaret.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="232"/>
THE queen, after this important victory, divided her
army; and sent the smaller division under Jasper Tudor,
earl of Pembroke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1461.</NOTE> half brother to the King, against
Edward, the present duke of York. She marched her∣self
with the larger division towards London, where the
earl of Warwic was left with the command of the York∣ists.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Mortimer's cross.</NOTE>
Pembroke was defeated by Edward at Mortimer's
Cross in Herefordshire with the loss of near 4000 men:
His army was dispersed; he himself escaped by flight;
but his father, Sir Owen Tudor, was taken prisoner,
and immediately beheaded by Edward's orders. This
barbarous practice, being once begun, was continued by
both parties, from revenge, which covered itself under
the pretence of retaliation<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Holingshed, p. 660. Grafton, p. 650.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MARGARET compensated this defeat by a victory
which she obtained over the earl of Warwic. That
nobleman, on the approach of the Lancastrians, led out
his army, re-inforced by a strong body of the Lon∣doners,
who were very affectionate to his cause; and
he gave battle to the Queen at St. Albans. While the
armies were warmly engaged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Second battle of St. Albans.</NOTE> Lovelace, who commanded
a considerable body of the Yorkists, treacherously with∣drew
from the combat; and this dishonourable action,
of which there are many instances in these civil wars,
decided the victory in favour of the Queen. About
2300 of the Yorkists perished in the battle and flight;
and the person of the King fell again into the hands of
his own party. This weak prince was sure to be almost
equally a prisoner whichever party had the keeping of him;
and scarce any more decorum was observed by the one
than by the other in their method of treating him. Lord
Bonville, to whose care he had been entrusted, staid with
him after the defeat, on assurance of pardon, given him
<PB N="219" REF="233"/>
by Henry: But Margaret, regardless of her husband's
promise, ordered immediately the head of that noble∣man
to be struck off by the executioner<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Holingshed, p. 660.</NOTE>. Sir Thomas
Kiriel, a brave warrior, who had signalized himself in the
French wars, was treated in the same inhuman manner.</P>
<P>THE Queen made no great advantage of this victory:
Young Edward advanced upon her from the other side;
and collecting the remains of Warwic's army, was soon
in a condition of giving her battle with superior forces.
She was sensible of her danger, if she lay between the
enemy and the city of London; and she found it neces∣sary
to retreat with her army to the north<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 652.</NOTE>. Edward
entered London amidst the acclamations of the citizens,
and immediately opened a new scene to his party. This
prince, in the bloom of youth, remarkable for the beauty
of his person, for his bravery, his activity, his affability,
and every popular quality, found himself so much pos∣sessed
of public favour, that, elated with the spirit
natural to his age, he resolved no longer to con∣fine
himself within those narrow limits, which his
father had prescribed to himself, and which had been
found by experience so prejudicial to his cause. He
determined to assume the name and dignity of King;
to insist openly on his claim; and thenceforth, to treat
the opposite party as traitors and rebels to his lawful
authority. But as a national consent, or the appearance
of it, seemed, notwithstanding his plausible title, to be
still requisite to precede this bold measure, and as the
assembling a parliament might occasion too many delays,
and be attended with other inconveniencies, he ventured
to proceed in a lese regular manner, and to put it out of
the power of his enemies to throw obstacles in the way
of his advancement. His army was ordered to assemble
in St. John's Fields; infinite numbers of people sur∣rounded
<PB N="220" REF="234"/>
rounded them; an harangue was pronounced to this
mixed multitude, setting forth the title of Edward, and
inveighing against the tyranny and usurpation of the ri∣val
family; and the people were then asked, whether
they would have Henry of Lancaster for King? They
universally exclaimed against the proposal. It was then
demanded, whether they would accept of Edward, eldest
son of the late duke of York? They expressed their con∣sent
with loud and joyful acclamations<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 415. Holingshed, p. 661.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Edward IV assumes the crown.</NOTE> A great num∣ber
of bishops, lords, magistrates, and other persons of
distinction, were then assembled at Baynard's castle, who
ratified the popular election; and the new King was
next day proclaimed in London,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5th March.</NOTE> under the name of Ed∣ward
IV<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Graston, p. 653.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN this manner, finished the reign of Henry VI. a mo∣narch,
who, while yet in his cradle, had been pro∣claimed
King both of France and England, and who
began his life with the most splendid prospects, which
any prince in Europe had ever enjoyed. The revolution
was unhappy for his people, as it was the source of
civil wars; but was almost entirely indifferent to Henry
himself, who was utterly incapable of exercising his au∣thority,
and who, provided he met personally with good
usage, was equally easy, as he was equally enslaved, in
the hands of his enemies and of his friends. His weak∣ness
and his disputed title were the chief causes of the
public misfortunes: But whether his Queen, and his
ministers, were not guilty of some great abuses of power,
it is not easy for us at this distance to determine: There
remain no proofs on record of any considerable violation
of the laws, except in the death of the duke of Gloce∣ster,
which was a private crime, formed no precedent,
<PB N="221" REF="235"/>
and was but too much of a piece with the usual ferocity
and cruelty of the times.</P>
<P>THE most remarkable law, which passed in this reign,
was that for the due election of members of paliament
in counties.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Miscella∣neous tran∣sactions of this reign.</NOTE> After the fall of the feudal system, the di∣stinction
of tenures was in a great measure lost; and
every freeholder, as well those who held of mesne lords,
as the immediate tenants of the crown, were by degrees
admitted to give their votes at elections. This inno∣vation
was confirmed by a law of Henry IV.<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Statutes at large, 7 Henry IV. cap. 15.</NOTE>; which
gave right to such a multitude of electors, as was the oc∣casion
of great disorder. In the eighth and tenth of this
King, therefore, laws were enacted, limiting the elec∣tors
to such as possessed forty shillings a-year in land,
free from all burden, within the county<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 8 Henry IV. cap. 7. 10 Henry IV. cap. 2.</NOTE>. This sum
was equivalent to near twenty pounds a-year of our pre∣sent
money; and it were to be wished, that the spirit,
as well as letter of this law, had been maintained.</P>
<P>THE preamble of the statute is remarkable: “Where∣as
the elections of knights, have of late, in many
counties of England, been made by outrageous, and
excessive numbers of people, many of them of small
substance and value, yet pretending to a right equal
to the best knights and esquires; whereby manslaugh∣ters,
riots, batteries, and divisions among the gentle∣men
and other people of the same counties, shall very
likely rise and be, unless due remedy be provided in
this behalf, &amp;c.” We may learn from these expres∣sions
what an important matter the election of a member
of parliament was now become in England: That as∣sembly
was beginning in this period to assume great au∣thority:
The commons had it much in their power to
enforce the execution of the laws; and if they failed in
<PB N="222" REF="236"/>
their duty, in this particular, it proceeded less from any
exorbitant power of the crown, than from the licentious
spirit of the aristocracy, and perhaps from the rude edu∣cation
of the age, and their own want of a due sense of
the advantages resulting from a regular administration of
justice.</P>
<P>WHEN the duke of York, the earls of Salisbury and
Warwic, f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed the kingdom upon the desertion of their
troops, a parliament was summoned at Coventry in 1460,
by which they were all attainted. This parliament
seems to have been very irregularly constituted, and
scarcely deserves the name: Insomuch, that an act
passed in it, “that all such knights of any county,
as were returned by virtue of the King's letters,
without any other election, should be valid, and that
no sheriff, for returning them, should incur the pe∣nalty
of the statute of Henry IV.”<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 664.</NOTE> All the acts of
that parliament were afterwards reversed; “because it
was unlawfully summoned, and the knights and barone
not duly chosen<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Statutes at large, 39 Henry VI. cap. 1.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THE parliaments in this reign, instead of relaxing their
vigilance against the usurpations of the court of Rome,
endeavoured to enforce the former statutes enacted to
that purpose. The commons petitioned, that no foreigner
should be capable of any church preferment, and that
the patron might be allwed to present anew upon the
non-residence of any incumbent<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 585.</NOTE>: But the King eluded
these petitions. Pope Martin wrote him a severe letter
against the statute of provisors; which he calls an abo∣minable
statute, that would infallibly damn every one,
who observed it<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Collection of Records, vol. i. p. 99.</NOTE>. The cardinal of Winchester was
legate; and being also a kind of prime minister, and im∣mensely
<PB N="223" REF="237"/>
mensely rich from the profits of his clerical dignity, the
parliament became jealous of his extending the papal
power; and they protested, that the cardinal should ab∣sent
himself in all affairs and councils of the King, when∣ever
the Pope or See of Rome was touched upon<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 593.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PERMISSION was given by parliament to export corn
when it was at low prices; wheat at six shillings and
eight pence a quarter, money of that age; barley at three
shillings and four pence<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Statutes at large, 15 Henry VI. cap. 2. 23 Henry VI. cap. 6.</NOTE>. It appears from these prices,
that corn still remained at about half its present value;
tho' other commodities were much cheaper. The inland
commerce of corn was also opened in the eighteenth of
the King, by allowing any collector of the customs to
give a licence for carrying it from one county to another<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 625.</NOTE>.
The same year a kind of navigation act was proposed
with regard to all places within the Streights; but the
King rejected it<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 626.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>YOUNG Edward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXII.</NOTE> now in his twentieth year, was
of a temper well fitted to make his way thro' such
a scene of war, havoc, and devastation, as must con∣duct
him to the full possession of that crown, which he
claimed from hereditary right, but which he had assumed
from the tumultuary election alone of his own party. He
was bold, active, enterprizing; and his hardness of heart
and severity of character rendered him impregnable to all
those movements of compassion, which might relax his
vigour in the prosecution of the most bloody revenges
against his enemies. The very commencement of his
reign gave symptoms of his sanguinary disposition. A
tradesman of London, who kept shop at the sign of the
<PB N="225" REF="239"/>
crown, having said, that he would make his son heir to
the crown; this harmless pleasantry was interpreted to
be spoke in derision of Edward's assumed title; and he
was condemned and executed for the offence<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Habington in Kennet, p. 431. Grafton, p. 791.</NOTE>. Such
an act of tyranny was a proper prelude to the scenes,
which ensued. The scaffold, as well as the field, stream∣ed
incessantly with the noblest blood of England, spilt
in the quarrel between the two contending families,
whose animosity was now become implacable. The
people, divided in their affections, took also opposite
symbols of party: The partizans of the house of Lan∣caster
chose the red rose as their mark of distinction;
those of York were denominated from the white; and
these civil wars were thus known, all over Europe, by
the name of the quarrel between the two roses.</P>
<P>THE licence, in which queen Margaret had been
obliged to indulge her troops, struck a great terror into
the city of London and all the southern parts of the king∣dom;
and as she there expected a very obstinate re∣sistance,
she prudently retired northwards among her own
partizans. The same licence, joined to the zea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of fac∣tion,
soon brought great multitudes to her standard; and
she was able, in a few days, to assemble an army sixty
thousand strong in Yorkshire. The King and the earl of
Warwic made haste, with an army of forty thousand,
to check her progress; and when they reached Pom∣fret,
they dispatched a body of troops, under the com∣mand
of the lord Fitzwalter, to secure the passage of
Ferrybridge over the river Are, which lay between them
and the enemy. Fitzwalter took post at the place as∣signed
him; but was not able to defend it against lord
Clifford, who attacked him with superior numbers. The
Yorkists were chased over the river with great slaugh∣ter;
<PB N="226" REF="240"/>
and lord Fitzwalter himself was slain in the ac∣tion<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">W. Wyrcester, p. 489. Hall, fol. 186. Holingshed, p. 664.</NOTE>.
The earl of Warwic, dreading the consequences
of this misfortune, at a time when a decisive action was
every hour expected, immediately ordered his horse to
be brought him, which he stabbed before the whole ar∣my;
and kissing the hilt of his sword, swore, that he
was determined to share the fate of the meanest soldier<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Habington, p. 432.</NOTE>.
And to shew the greater fecurity, a proclamation was at
the same time issued, giving to every one who pleased
full liberty to retire; but menacing the severest punish∣ments
to those who should discover any symptoms of
cowardice in the ensuing battle<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Holingshed, p. 664.</NOTE>. Lord Falconbridge was
sent to recover the post which had been lost; he passed the
river some miles above Ferrybridge, and falling unexpect∣edly
on lord Clifford, he revenged the former disaster by
the defeat of the party and the death of their leader<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hist. Croyl. cont. p. 532.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE two hostile armies met at Touton;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Touton. 29th of March.</NOTE> and a fierce
and bloody battle ensued. While the Yorkists were ad∣vancing
to the charge, there happened a great fall of
snow, which, driving full on the faces of their enemies,
blinded them; and this advantage was improved by a
stratagem of lord Falconbridge. That nobleman or∣dered
some infantry to advance before the line, and
after having sent a volley of flight-arrows, as they were
called, amidst the enemy, immediately to retire. The
Lancastrians, imagining that they were got within reach
of the opposite army, discharged all their arrows, which
thus fell short of the Yorkists, without doing any execu∣tion<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 186.</NOTE>. After the quivers of the enemy were exhausted,
Edward advanced his line, and committed slaughter with
impunity on the dismayed Lancastrians: The bow how∣ever
was soon laid aside, and the sword decided the combat,
<PB N="227" REF="241"/>
which ended in a total victory on the side of the York∣ists.
Edward issued orders to give no quarter<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Habington, p. 432.</NOTE>: The
routed army was pursued to Tadcaster with great blood∣shed
and confusion; and above thirty-six thousand men
are computed to have fallen in the battle and pursuit<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Holingshed, p. 665. Grafton, p. 656. Hist. Croyl. cont. p. 533.</NOTE>:
Among these were the earl of Westmoreland, and his
brother, Sir John Nevil, the earl of Northumberland,
the lords Dacres and Welles, and Sir Andrew Trollop<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 187. Habington, p. 433.</NOTE>.
The earl of Devonshire, who was now engaged in Hen∣ry's
party, was brought a prisoner to Edward; and was
soon after beheaded by martial law at York. His head
was fixed on a pole erected over the gates of that city;
and the head of duke Richard and that of the earl of Sa∣lisbury
were taken down, and buried with their bodies.
Henry and Margaret had remained at York during the
action; but learning the defeat of their army, and being
sensible, that no place in England could now afford them
shelter, they fled with great precipitation into Scotland.
They were accompanied by the duke of Exeter, who,
tho' he had married Edward's sister, had taken part with
the Lancastrians, and by Henry duke of Somerset, who
had commanded in the unfortunate battle of Touton,
and who was the son of that nobleman killed in the first
battle of St. Albans.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the great animosity, which pre∣vailed
between the two kingdoms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry escapes in∣to Scotland.</NOTE> Scotland had never
exerted itself with vigour, to take advantage either of
the wars which England carried on with France, or of
the civil wars which broke out between the contending
families. James I. more laudably employed, in civilizing
his subjects and taming them to the salutary yoke of law
and justice, avoided all hostilities with foreign nations;
<PB N="228" REF="242"/>
and tho' he seemed interested to maintain a balance be∣tween
France and England, he gave no farther assist∣ance
to the former kingdom in its greatest distresses,
than permitting, and perhaps encouraging, his subjects
to inlist in the French service. After the murder of that
excellent prince, the minority of his son and successor,
James II. and the distractions incident to it, retained the
Scots in the same state of neutrality; and the superiority,
visibly acquired by France, rendered it then unnecessary
for her ally to interpose in her defence. But when the
quarrel commenced between the houses of York and
Lancaster, and became absolutely incurable but by the
total extinction of one party; James, who had now
risen to man's estate, was tempted to seize this ad∣vantage,
and he endeavoured to recover those pla∣ces,
which the English had formerly conquered from
his ancestors. He laid siege to the castle of Roxbo∣rough
in 1460, and had provided himself of a small
train of artillery for that enterprize: But his cannon
were so ill framed, that one of them burst as he was
firing it, and put an end to his life in the flower of his
age. His son and successor, James III. was also a mi∣nor:
The usual distractions ensued in the government:
The Queen-dowager, Anne of Gueldres, aspired to the
regency: The family of Douglas opposed her preten∣sions:
And Queen Margaret, when she fled into Scot∣land,
found there a people little less divided by faction,
than those by whom she had been expelled. Tho' she
pleaded the connexions between the royal family of Scot∣land
and the house of Lancaster, by the young King's
grandmother, who was a daughter of the earl of So∣merset;
she could engage the Scots council to go no
farther than to express their good wishes in her favour:
But on her offer to deliver to them immediately the im∣portant
fortress of Berwic, and to contract her son in
marriage with a sister of King James, she found a be∣tter
<PB N="229" REF="243"/>
reception; and the Scots promised the assistance of
their arms to re-instate her family upon the throne<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 137. Habington, p. 434.</NOTE>.
But as the danger from that quarter seemed not very ur∣gent
to Edward, he did not pursue the fugitive King
and Queen into their retreat; but returned to London,
where a parliament was summoned for settling the go∣vernment.</P>
<P>ON the meeting of this assembly, Edward found the<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th Nov. A parliament.</NOTE>
good effects of his vigorous measure in assuming the
crown, as well as of his victory at Touton, by which he
had secured it: The parliament no longer hesitated be∣tween
the two families, or proposed any of those ambi∣guous
decisions, which could only tend to perpetuate
and inflame the animosities of party. They recognized
the title of Edward to the crown, by hereditary descent,
thro' the family of Mortimer; and declared, that he was
King in right, from the death of his father, who had
also the same lawful title; and that he was in possession
of the throne from the day that he assumed the go∣vernment,
tendered to him by the acclamations of the
people<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 670.</NOTE>. They expressed their abhorrence of the usurpa∣tion
and intrusion of the house of Lancaster, particularly
that of the earl of Derby, otherwise called Henry IV.
which, they said, had been attended with every kind of
disorder, the murder of the sovereign and the oppression
of the subjects. They annulled every grant which had
passed in those reigns; they reinstated the King in all
the possessions, which had belonged to the erown at the
pretended deposition of Richard II. and tho' they con∣firmed
judicial deeds and the decrees of inferior courts,
they reversed all attainders passed in any pretended par∣liament;
particularly the attainder of the earl of Cam∣bridge,
the King's grandfather; as well as that of the
<PB N="230" REF="244"/>
earls of Salisbury and Glocester and of lord Lumley,
who were forfeited for adhering to Richard II<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 672. Statutes at large, 1 Edw. IV. cap. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MANY of these votes were the result of the usual vio∣lence
of party: The common sense of mankind, in more
peaceable times, repealed them: And the statutes of the
house of Lancaster, being the deeds of an established go∣vernment,
and enacted by princes long possessed of au∣thority,
have always been held as valid and obligatory.
The parliament, however, in subverting such deep foun∣dations,
had still the pretence of replacing the govern∣ment
on its antient and natural basis: But in their sub∣sequent
measures, they were more guided by revenge, or
at least the views of convenience, than by the maxims of
equity and justice. They passed an act of forfeiture and
attainder against Henry VI. and Queen Margaret, and
their infant son, prince Edward: The same act was ex∣tended
to the dukes of Somerset and Exeter; to the
carls of Northumberland, Devonshire, Pembroke, Wilts;
to the viscount Beaumont, the lords Roos, Nevil, Clif∣ford,
Wells, Dacre, Gray of Rugemont, Hungerford; to
Alexander Hedie, Nicholas Latimer, Edmond Mountfort,
John Heron, and many other persons of distinction<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 670. W. Wyrcester, p. 490.</NOTE>.
The parliament vested the estates of all these attainted
persons in the crown; tho' their sole crime was the ad∣hering
to a prince, whom every individual of the parlia∣ment
had so long recognized, and whom that very King
himself, who was now seated on the throne, had acknow∣ledged
and obeyed as his lawful sovereign.</P>
<P>THE necessity of supporting the government established,
will justify more fully some other acts of violence; tho'
the method of conducting them may still appear excep∣tionable.
John earl of Oxford and his son, Aubrey de
<PB N="231" REF="245"/>
Vere, were detected in a correspondence with Marga∣ret,
were tried by martial law before the constable, were
condemned and executed<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">W. de Wyrcester, p. 492. Hall, fol. 189. Grafton, p. 658. Fabian, fol. 215. Fragm. ad finem T. Sproti.</NOTE>. Sir William Tyrrel, Sir
Thomas Tudenham, and John Montgomery were con∣victed
in the same arbitrary court; were executed, and
their estates forfeited. This introduction of martial law
into civil government was a high strain of prerogative;
which, were it not for the violence of the times, would
probably have appeared exceptionable to a nation so jea∣lous
of their liberties as the English were now become<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">That we may judge how arbitrary a court, that of the constable of England was, we may peruse the patent granted to the earl of Rivers in this reign, as it is to be found in Spellman's Glossary in verb. <HI>Constabu∣larius;</HI> as also, more fully in Rymer, vol. xi. p. 581. Here is a clause of it: <HI>Et ulterius de uberiori gratia nostra eidem comiti de Rivers plenam po∣testatem damus ad cognoscendum, &amp; procedendum, in omnibus, &amp; singulis, cau∣sis et negotiis, de et super crimine lesae majestatis seu super occasione caeterisque causis, quibuscunque per praefatum comitem de Rivers, ut constabularium Angliae—quae in curia constabularii Angliae ab antiquo,</HI> viz. <HI>tempore dicti domini Gulielmi conquestoris seu aliquo tempore citra tractari, audiri, examinari, aut decidi consueverant, aut jure debuerant, aut debent, causasque et negotia prae∣dicta cum omnibus et singulis emergentibus, incidentibus &amp; connexis, audiendum, examinandum, et fine debito terminandum, etiam</HI> summarie et de plano, sine strepitu et figura justitiae, sola facti verita'e inspecta, <HI>ac etiam manu re∣gia, si opportunum visum fuerit eidem comiti de Rivers, vices nostras, appella∣tione remota.</HI> The office of constable was perpetual in the monarchy; its jurisdiction was not limited to times of war, as appears from this patent, and as we learn from the same author: Yet its authority was in direct con∣tradiction to <HI>Magna Charta;</HI> and it is evident that no <HI>regular</HI> liberty could subsist with it. It involved a full dictatorial power, continually subsisting in the state. The only check on the crown, besides the want of force to support all its prerogatives, was, that the office of constable was commonly either hereditary or during life; and the person invested with it, was, for that reason, not so proper an instru∣ment of arbitrary power in the King. Accordingly, the office was sup∣pressed by Henry VIII. the most arbitrary of all the English princes. The practice, however, of exercising martial law, still subsisted; and was not abolished till the Petition of Right under Charles I. This was the epoch of true liberty, confirmed by the Restoration, and enlarged and secured by the Revolution.</NOTE>.
<PB N="232" REF="246"/>
It was impossible but such a great and sudden revolution
must leave the roots of discontent and dissatisfaction in
the subjects, which would require great art, or in lieu of
it, great violence to extirpate them. The latter was
more suitable to the genius of the nation in that uncul∣tivated
age.</P>
<P>BUT the new establishment seemed precarious and
uncertain; not only from the domestic discontents of the
people, but from the efforts of foreign powers. Lewis,
the eleventh of the name, had succeeded to his father,
Charles, in 1460; and was led, from the obvious mo∣tives
of national interest, to feed the flames of civil dis∣cord
among such dangerous neighbours, by giving sup∣port
to the weaker party. But the intriguing and politic
genius of this prince was here checked by itself: Having
attempted to subdue the independant spirit of his own
vassals, he had excited such an opposition at home, as
prevented him from making all the advantage, which the
opportunity afforded, of the dissensions among the Eng∣lish.
He sent however a small body to Henry's assist∣ance
under Varenne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1462.</NOTE> Seneschal of Normandy<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Monstrelet, vol. iii. p. 95.</NOTE>, who
landed in Northumberland, and got possession of the
castle of Alnewic; but as the indefatigable Margaret
went in person to France, where she solicited larger sup∣plies<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">W. Wyrcester, p. 493. Hall, fol. 190. Hollingshed, p. 665.</NOTE>; and promised Lewis to deliver up Calais, if her
family was by his means restored to the throne of Eng∣land;
he was afterwards persuaded to send along with
her a body of 2000 men at arms<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">W. Wyrcester, p. 493.</NOTE>, which enabled her to
<PB N="233" REF="247"/>
take the field, and to make an inroad into England. Tho'
reinforced by a numerous train of adventurers from Scot∣land,
and by many partizans of the family of Lancaster;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1464.</NOTE>
she received a check at Hedgley-more from lord Monta∣cute
or Montague,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th April.</NOTE> brother to the earl of Warwic, and
warden of the east Marches between Scotland and Eng∣land<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xi. p. 500.</NOTE>.
Montague was so elated with this success, that,
while a numerous reinforcement was on their march to
join him by orders from Edward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Hexham. 15th May.</NOTE> he yet ventured, with
his own troops alone, to attack the Lancastrians at
Hexham, and he obtained a complete victory over them.
The duke of Somerset, the lords Roos, and Hungerford,
were taken in the pursuit, and immediately beheaded by
martial law at Hexham<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">W. Wyrcester, p. 498. Hall, fol. 190. Grafton, p. 661.</NOTE>. Summary justice was in like
manner executed at Newcastle on Sir Humphrey Nevil,
and several other gentlemen<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Fabian, fol. 215. Polyd. Virg. p. 512, 513.</NOTE>. All those who were spared
in the field, suffered on the scaffold; and the utter
extermination of their adversaries was now become the
plain object of the York party; a conduct, which re∣ceived
but too plausible an apology from the preceding
practice of the Lancastrians.</P>
<P>THE fate of the unfortunate royal family, after this
defeat, was very singular. Margaret, flying with her
son into a forest, where she endeavoured to conceal her∣self,
was beset, during the darkness of the night, by
robbers, who either ignorant or regardless of her quality,
despoiled her of her rings and jewels, and treated her
with the utmost indignity. The partition of this rich
booty raised a quarrel among them; and while their at∣tention
was thus engaged, she took the opportunity of
making her escape with her son into the thickest of the
forest, where she wandered for some time, over-spent
<PB N="232" REF="248"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="233" REF="249"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="234" REF="250"/>
with hunger and fatigue, and sunk with terror and af∣fliction.
While in this wretched condition, she saw a
robber approach with his naked sword; and finding
that she had no means of escape, she suddenly em∣braced
the resolution of trusting entirely for protec∣tion
to his faith and generosity. She advanced to∣wards
him; and presenting to him the young prince,
called out to him, <HI>Here, my friend, I commit to your
care the safety of your King's son.</HI> The man, whose
humanity and generous spirit had been obscured, but
not entirely lost, by his vicious course of life, was
struck with the singul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rity of the event, and charmed
with the confidence reposed in him; and he vowed, not
only to abstain from all injury against the princess, but
to devote himself entirely to her safety and protection<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Monstrelet, vol. iii. p. 96.</NOTE>.
By his means she dwelt some time concealed in the forest,
and was at last conducted to the sea-coast, whence she
made her escape into Flanders. She passed thence into
her father's court, where she lived several years in pri∣vacy
and retirement. Her husband was not so fortunate
or so dextrous in finding the means of his escape. Some
of his friends took him under their protection, and con∣veyed
him into Lancashire; where he remained con∣cealed
during a twelvemonth; but he was at last detect∣ed,
delivered up to Edward, and thrown into the Tower<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 191. Fragm. ad finem Sproti.</NOTE>.
The safety of his person was owing less to the generosity
of his enemies, than to the contempt, which they had
entertained of his courage and his understanding.</P>
<P>THE imprisonment of Henry, the expulsion of Mar∣garet,
the execution and confiscation of all the most con∣siderable
Lancastrians, seemed to give full security to
Edward's government; whose title by blood, being now
<PB N="235" REF="251"/>
recognized by parliament, and universally submitted to
by the people, was no longer in danger of being im∣peached
by any antagonist. In this prosperous situation,
the King delivered himself up, without controul, to those
pleasures which his youth, his high fortune, and his na∣tural
temperament invited him to enjoy; and the cares
of royalty were less attended to, than the dissipation of
amusement, or the allurements of passion. The cruel
and unrelenting spirit of Edward, tho' enured to the fe∣rocity
of civil wars, was at the same time extremely
devoted to the softer passions, which, without mitigating
his severe temper, maintained a great influence over him,
and shared his attachment with the pursuits of ambition,
and the thirst of military glory. During the present in∣terval
of peace, he lived in the most familiar and so∣ciable
manner with his subjects<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Polyd. Virg. p. 513. Biondi.</NOTE>, particularly with the
Londoners; and the beauty of his person, as well as
the gallantry of his address, which, even unassisted by
his royal dignity, would have rendered him extremely
acceptable to the fair sex, facilitated all his applications
for their favour. This easy and pleasurable life aug∣mented
every day his popularity among all ranks of men:
He was the peculiar favourite of the young and gay of
both sexes: The disposition of the English, little ad∣dicted
to jealousy, kept them from taking umbrage at
these liberties: And his indulgence in amusements, while
it gratified his inclination, was thus become, without
design, a means of supporting and securing his govern∣ment:
But as it is difficult to reduce the ruling passion
within strict rules of prudence, the amorous temper of
Edward led him into a snare which proved very fatal to
his future repose, and to the stability of his throne.</P>
<P>JAQUELINE DE LUXEMBOURG, dutchess of Bedford,
<PB N="236" REF="252"/>
had, after her husband's death, so far sacrificed her am∣bition
to love, that she espoused, in second marriage,
Sir Richard Wideville, a private gentleman, afterwards
created lord Rivers, to whom she bore several children,
and among the rest, Eli∣zabeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's marriage with the lady Elizabeth Gray.</NOTE> who was remarkable for
the grace and beauty of her person, as well as for other
amiable accomplishments. This young lady had married
Sir John Gray of Groby, by whom she had children; and
her husband being killed in the second battle of St. Albans,
fighting on the side of Lancaster, and his estate being
for that reason confiscated, his widow retired to live with
her father, at his seat of Grafton in Northamptonshire.
The King came accidentally to the house, after a hunt∣ing
party, in order to pay a visit to the dutchess of Bed∣ford;
and as the occasion seemed favourable for obtain∣ing
some grace from this gallant monarch, the young
widow flung herself at his feet, and with many tears,
entreated him to take pity on her impoverished and di∣stressed
children. The sight of so much beauty in af∣fliction,
strongly affected the amorous Edward; love
stole insensibly into his heart under the guise of com∣passion;
and her sorrow, so becoming a virtuous matron,
made his esteem and regard quickly correspond to his
affection. He raised her from the ground with assurances
of favour; he found his passion encrease every moment,
by the conversation of the amiable object; and he was
soon reduced in his turn to the posture and stile of a
supplicant at the feet of Elizabeth. But the lady, either
averse to dishonourable love from a sense of duty, or
perceiving that the impression which she had made was
so deep as to give her hopes of obtaining the highest
elevation, obstinately refused to gratify his passion; and
all the endearments, caresses, and importunity of the
young and amiable Edward, proved fruitless against her
rigid and inflexible virtue. His passion, irritated by op∣position,
<PB N="237" REF="253"/>
and encreased by his veneration for such ho∣nourable
sentiments, carried him at last beyond all bounds
of reason; and he offered to share his throne, as well
as his heart, with the woman, whose beauty of person,
and dignity of character, seemed so well to entitle her
to both. The marriage was celebrated privately at
Grafton<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 193. Fabian, fol. 216.</NOTE>: The secret was carefully kept for some
time: No one suspected, that so libertine a prince could
sacrifice so much to a romantic passion: And there were
in particular strong reasons, which at that time ren∣dered
this step in the highest degree dangerous and im∣prudent.</P>
<P>THE King, desirous to secure his throne, as well by
the prospect of issue, as by foreign alliances, had, a
little before, determined to make application to some
neighbouring princess; and he had cast his eye on Bona
of Savoy, sister to the Queen of France, who, he hoped,
would, by his marrying her, ensure him the friendship
of that power, which was alone both able and inclined
to give support and assistance to his rival. To render
the negotiation more successful, the earl of Warwic had
been dispatched to Paris, where the princess then re∣sided;
he had demanded Bona in marriage for the King;
his proposals had been accepted; the treaty was fully
concluded; and nothing remained but the ratification of
the terms agreed on, and the bringing over the princess
into England<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 193. Habington, p. 437. Holingshed, p. 667. Grafton, p. 665. Polyd, Virg. p. 513.</NOTE>. But when the secret of Edward's mar∣riage
broke out, the haughty earl, deeming himself
affronted, both by being employed in this deceitful ne∣gotiation,
and by being kept a stranger to the King's
intentions, who had owed every thing to his friendship,
immediately returned to England, inflamed with rage
<PB N="238" REF="254"/>
and indignation. The influence of passion, over so young
a man as Edward, might have served as an excuse for his
imprudent conduct, had he deigned to acknowledge his
error, or had pleaded his weakness as an apology:
But his faulty shame or pride prevented him from so
much as mentioning the affair to Warwic; and that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Warwic disgusted.</NOTE>
nobleman was allowed to depart the court, full of the
same ill humour and discontent, which he brought to it.</P>
<P>EVERY incident now tended to widen the breach be∣tween
the King and this powerful subject.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1466.</NOTE> The Queen
lost not her influence by marriage; and she was equally
solicitous to draw every grace and favour to her own
friends and kindred, and to exclude those of the earl,
whom she regarded as her mortal enemy. Her father
was created earl of Rivers: He was made lord treasurer
in the room of lord Mountjoy<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">W. Wyrcester, p. 506.</NOTE>: He was invested in the
office of constable for life; and his son received the sur∣vivance
of that high dignity<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xi. p. 581.</NOTE>. The same young noble∣man
was married to the only daughter of lord Scales,
enjoyed the great estate of that family, and had the title
of Scales conferred upon him. Catharine, the Queen's
sister, was married to the young duke of Buckingham,
who was a ward of the crown<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">W. Wyrcester, p. 505.</NOTE>: Mary, another of her
sisters, espoused William Herbert, created earl of Hun∣tingdon:
Anne, a third sister, was given in marriage to
the son and heir of Gray, lord Ruthyn, created earl of
Kent<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 506.</NOTE>. The daughter and heir of the duke of Exeter,
who was also the King's niece, was contracted to Sir
Thomas Gray, one of the Queen's sons by her former
husband; and as the lord Montague was treating of a
marriage between his son and this lady, the preference
<PB N="239" REF="255"/>
given to young Gray was deemed an injury and affront
to the whole family of Nevil.</P>
<P>THE earl of Warwic could not endure the least dimi∣nution
of that credit, which he had long enjoyed, and
which, he thought, he had merited by such important
services. Tho' he had received so many grants from the
crown, that the revenue arising from them amounted,
besides his patrimonial estate, to 80,000 crowns a year,
according to the computation of Philip de Comines<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Liv. 5. chap. 4.</NOTE>;
his ambitious spirit was still dissatisfied, so long as he saw
others surpass him in authority and influence with the
King<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Polyd. Virg. p. 514.</NOTE>. Edward also, jealous of that power which had
supported him, and which he himself had contributed
still higher to exalt, was well pleased to raise up rivals
in credit to the earl of Warwic; and he justified by this
political view, his extreme partiality to the Queen's
kindred. But the other nobility of England, envying
the sudden growth of the Widevilles<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Hist. Croyl. cont. p. 539.</NOTE>, were more in∣clined
to take part with Warwic's discontent, to whose
grandeur they were already accustomed, and who had
reconciled them to his superiority by his gracious and
popular manners. And as Edward obtained from par∣liament
a general resumption of all grants, which he had
made since his accession, and which had extremely im∣poverished
the crown<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">W. Wyrcester, p. 508.</NOTE>; this act, tho' it passed with
some exceptions, particularly one in favour of the earl
of Warwic, gave a general alarm to the nobility, and
disgusted many, even zealous partizans of the family of
York.</P>
<P>BUT the most considerable associate, whom Warwic
acquired to his party, was George, duke of Clarence,
<PB N="240" REF="256"/>
the King's second brother. This prince deemed him∣self
no less injured than the other grandees, by the un∣controuled
influence of the queen and her relations;
and as his fortunes were still left on a precarious footing,
while theirs were fully established, this neglect, joined
to his unquiet and restless spirit, inclined him to give
countenance to all the malecontents<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 673.</NOTE>. The favourable
opportunity of gaining him was espied by the earl of
Warwic, who offered him in marriage his eldest daugh∣ter,
and co-heir of his immense fortunes; a settlement
which, as it was superior to any that the King himself
could confer upon him, immediately attached him to the
earl's party<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">W. Wyrcester, p. 511. Hall, fol. 200. Habington, p. 439. Holingshed, p. 671. Polyd. Virg. p. 515.</NOTE>. Thus an extensive and dangerous com∣bination
was insensibly formed against Edward and his
ministry: Tho' the object of the malecontents was not
at present to overturn the throne, it was difficult to fore∣see
the extremities, to which they might be carried; and
as opposition to an administration was usually in those
ages prosecuted by force of arms, civil convulsions and
disorders were likely to be soon the result of these in∣trigues
and confederacies.</P>
<P>WHILE this cloud was gathering at home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alliance with the duke of Burgundy.</NOTE> Edward
carried his views abroad, and endeavoured to secure him∣self
against his factious nobility, by entering into foreign
alliances. The dark and dangerous ambition of Louis XI.
the more it was known, the greater alarm it excited
among all his neighbours and vassals; and as it was sup∣ported
by great abilities, and unrestrained by any prin∣ciples
of faith or humanity, they found no security to
themselves but by a jealous combination against him.
Philip, duke of Burgundy, was now dead: His rich and
<PB N="241" REF="257"/>
extensive dominions were devolved to Charles, his only
son, whose martial disposition acquired him the sirname
of <HI>Hardy,</HI> and whose ambition, more outrageous than
that of Lewis, but seconded by less power and policy,
was regarded with a more favourable eye by the other
powers of Europe. The opposition of interests, and
still more, a natural antipathy of character, produced
a declared animosity between these two bad princes; and
Edward was thus secure of the sincere attachment of
either of them, for whom he should choose to declare
himself. The duke of Burgundy, being descended by
his mother, a daughter of Portugal, from John of Gaunt,
was naturally inclined to favour the house of Lancaster<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 4. 6.</NOTE>:
But this consideration was easily overbalanced by poli∣tics;
and Charles, perceiving the interest of that house
to be extremely decayed in England, sent over his na∣tural
brother, commonly called the bastard of Burgundy,
to carry in his name proposals of marriage to Margaret the
King's sister. The alliance of Burgundy was more popular
with the English, than that of France; the commercial
interests of the two nations invited the princes to a close
union; their common jealousy of Lewis was a natural
cement between them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1468.</NOTE> and Edward, pleased with
strengthening himself by so potent a confederate, soon
concluded the alliance, and bestowed his sister upon
Charles<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 169. 197.</NOTE>. A league, which Edward at the same time
concluded with the duke of Brittany, seemed both to
encrease his security, and to open to him the prospect of
rivalling his predecessors in those foreign conquests,
which, however short-lived and unprofitable, had ren∣dered
their reign so popular and illustrious<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">W. Wyrcester, p. 5. Parliament. Hist. vol. li p. 332.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="258"/>
BUT whatever ambitious schemes the King might
have built on these alliances, they were soon frustrated
by intestine commotions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1469.</NOTE> which engrossed all his atten∣tion.
These disorders probably arose not immediately
from the intrigues of the earl of Warwic, but from ac∣cident,
assisted by the turbulent spirit of the age, by the
general humour of discontent which that popular noble∣man
had instilled into the nation, and perhaps by some
remains of attachment to the house of Lancaster. The
hospital of St. Leonards near York,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrec∣tion in Yorkshire.</NOTE> had received, from
an antient grant of King Athelstane, a right of levying
a thrave of corn from every plough-land in the county;
and as these charitable establishments are very liable to
abuse, the country people complained, that the re∣venue
of the hospital was no longer expended for the re∣lief
of the poor, but was secreted by the managers, and
employed for their private purposes. After long repining
at the contribution, they refused payment: Ecclesiastical
and civil censures were issued against them: Their goods
were distrained, and their persons thrown into jail:
Till, as their ill-humour daily encreased, they rose in
arms; fell upon the officers of the hospital, whom they
put to the sword; and proceeded in a body, fifteen thou∣sand
strong, to the gates of York<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 200. Holingshed, p. 672. Polyd. Virg. p. 516.</NOTE>. The lord Montague,
who commanded in those parts, opposed himself to their
progress; and having been so fortunate in a skirmish as
to seize Robert Hulderne their leader, he ordered him
immediately to be led to execution; according to the
barbarous and illegal practice of those times<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 674.</NOTE>. The
rebels, however, still continued in arms; and be∣ing
soon headed by men of greater distinction, Sir
Henry Nevil, son of lord Latimer, and Sir John Co∣niers,
<PB N="243" REF="259"/>
they advanced southwards, and began to appear
dangerous to the government. Herbert, earl of Pem∣broke,
who had received that title on the forfeiture of
Jasper Tudor, was ordered by Edward to march a∣gainst
them at the head of a body of Welshmen;
and he was joined by five thousand archers under the
command of Stafford, earl of Devonshire, who had suc∣cecded
in that title to the family of Courtney, which had
also been forfeited. But a trivial difference about quar∣ters
having begot an animosity between these two noble∣men,
the earl of Devonshire retired with his archers, and
lest Pembroke alone to encounter the rebels<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 221. Holingshed, p. 672. Fragm. ad finem Sprotti.</NOTE>. The two
armies approached hear Banbury;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Banbury.</NOTE> and Pembroke, hav∣ing
prevailed in a skirmish, and having taken Sir
Henry Nevil prisoner, ordered him immediately to be
put to death, without any form of process. This
execution enraged, without terrifying, the rebels:
They attacked the Welsh army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">26th July.</NOTE> routed them, put them
to the sword without mercy; and having seized Pem∣broke,
they took immediate revenge upon him for the
death of their leader<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 201, 202. Grafton, p. 676.</NOTE>. The King, imputing this mis∣fortune
to the earl of Devonshire, who had deserted Pem∣broke,
ordered him to be executed in a like summary
manner. But these speedy executions, or rather open
murders, did not stop there: The northern rebels, send∣ing
a party to Grafton, seized the earl of Rivers and his
son John; men who had become obnoxious by their near
relation to the King and his partiality towards them:
And these noblemen were immediately executed by orders
from Sir John Coniers<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fabian, fol. 217.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="260"/>
THERE is no part of English history since the Con∣quest,
so obscure, so uncertain, so little authentic or
consistent, as that of the wars, between the two Roses:
Historians differ about many material circumstances; some
events of the utmost consequence, in which they almost
all agree, are incredible and contradicted by records<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">We shall give an instance: Almost all the historians, even Co∣mines, and the continuator of the annals of Croyland, assert that Ed∣ward was about this time taken prisoner by Clarence and Warwic, and was committed to the custody of the archbishop of York, brother to the earl; but being allowed to take the diversion of hunting by this pre∣late, he made his escape, and afterwards chaced the rebels out of the kingdom. But that all the story is false appears from Rymer, where we find, that the King, throughout all this period, continually exercised his authority, and never was interrupted in his go∣vernment. On the 7th of March 1470, he gives a commission of array to Clarence, whom he then imagined a good subject; and on the 23d of the same month, we find him issuing an order for apprehending him. Besides, in the King's manifesto against the duke and earl, (Claus. 10. Edward IV. m. 7. 8.) where he enu∣merates all their treasons, he mentions no such fact: He does not so much as accuse them of exciting young Welles's rebellion: He only says, that they exhorted him to continue in his rebellion. We may judge how smaller facts will be misrepresented by historians, who can in the most material transactions mistake so grossly. There may even some scruple arise with regard to the proposals of marriage made to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ona of Savoy; tho' almost all the historians concur in it, and the fact be very likely in itself▪ For there are no traces in Rymer of any such embassy of Warwic's to France. The chief certainty in this and the preceding reign arises either from public records, or from the notice taken of certain passages by the French historians. On the contrary, for some centuries after the Conquest, the French history is not com∣pleat without the assistance of English authors.</NOTE>;
and it is remarkable, that this profound darkness falls
upon us just on the eve of the restoration of letters, and
when the art of Printing was already known in Europe.
All we can distinguish with certainty thro' the deep cloud,
which covers that period, is a scene of horror and blood∣shed,
<PB N="245" REF="261"/>
savage manners, arbitrary executions, and treache∣rous
dishonourable conduct in all parties. There is no
possibility, for instance, of accounting for the views and
intentions of the earl of Warwic at this time. It is
agreed, that he resided, with his son-in-law, the duke
of Clarence, in his government of Calais, during the
commencement of this rebellion; and that his brother
Montague, acted with vigour against the northern rebels.
We may thence presume, that the insurrection had not
proceeded from the secret councils and instigation of
Warwic; tho' the murder, committed by the rebels,
on the earl of Rivers, his capital enemy, forms, on the
other hand, a violent presumption against him. He and
Clarence came over to England, offered their service to
Edward, were received without any suspicion, were en∣trusted
by him in the highest commands<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xi. p. 647, 649, 650.</NOTE>, and still per∣severed
in their fidelity. Soon after, we find the rebels
quieted and dispersed by a general pardon granted by Ed∣ward
from the advice of the earl of Warwic: But why so
courageous a prince, if secure of Warwic's fidelity, should
have granted a general pardon to men, who had been
guilty of such violent and personal outrages against him,
is not intelligible; nor why that nobleman, if unfaithful,
should have endeavoured to appease a rebellion, of which
he was able to make such advantages. But it appears,
that, after this insurrection, there was an interval of
peace, during which the King loaded the family of Nevil
with honours and favours of the highest nature: He
made the lord Montague a marquess, by the same name:
He created his son, George, duke of Bedford<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 702.</NOTE>: He
declared publicly his intention of marrying that young
nobleman to his eldest daughter, Elizabeth, who, as he
<PB N="246" REF="262"/>
had yet no sons, was the presumptive heir of the crown:
Yet we find, that, soon after, being invited to a feast
by the archbishop of York, a younger brother of War∣wic
and Montague, he entertained a sudden suspicion,
that they intended to seize his person or to murder him:
And he abruptly departed from the entertainment<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Fragm. Ed. IV. ad fin. Sprotti.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOON after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1470.</NOTE> there broke out another rebellion, which
is as unaccountable as all the preceding events; chiefly
because no sufficient reason is assigned for it, and because,
so far as it appears, the family of Nevil had no hand in
exciting and fomenting it. It arose in Lincolnshire,
and was headed by Sir Robert Welles, son to the lord of
that name. The army of the rebels amounted to 30,000
men; but the lord Welles himself, far from giving coun∣tenance
to them, fled into a sanctuary, in order to se∣cure
his person against the King's anger or suspicions.
He was drawn from this retreat by a promise of safety;
and was soon after, notwithstanding this assurance, be∣headed,
along with Sir Thomas Dymoc, by orders from
Edward<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 204. Fabian, fol. 218. Habington, p. 442. Ho∣lingshed, p. 674.</NOTE>. The King fought a battle with the rebels,
defeated them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th March.</NOTE> took Sir Robert Welles and Sir Thomas
Launde prisoners, and ordered them immediately to be
beheaded.</P>
<P>EDWARD, during these transactions, had so little jea∣lousy
of the earl of Warwic or duke of Clarence, that
he granted them commissions of array for levying forces
against the rebels<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xi. p. 652.</NOTE>: But these noblemen, so soon as they left the court, raised troops in their own name, issued
declarations against the government, and complained of
<PB N="247" REF="263"/>
grievances, oppressions, and bad ministers. The unex∣pected
defeat of Welles disconcerted all their measures;
and they retired northwards into Lancashire, where they
expected to be joined by lord Stanley, who had married
the earl of Warwic's sister. But as that nobleman
refused all concurrence with them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Warwic and Cla∣rence ba∣nished.</NOTE> and as lord Mon∣tague
also remained quiet in Yorkshire; they were ob∣liged
to dissolve their army, and to fly into Devonshire,
where they embarked and made sail towards Calais<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">The King offered by proclamation a reward of 1000 pounds, or 100 pounds a year in land, to any that would seize them. Whence we may learn that land was at that time sold for about ten years pur∣chase. See Rymer, vol. xi. p. 654.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE deputy governor, whom Warwic had left at
Calais, was one Vaucler, a Gascon, who, seeing the
earl return in this miserable condition, refused him ad∣mission
into the place; and would not so much as per∣mit
the dutchess of Clarence to land, tho' a few days
before, she had been delivered on ship-board of a son,
and was at that time extremely disordered by sickness.
With difficulty, he would allow a few <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laggons of wine
to be carried to the ship for the use of the ladies: But
as he was a man of sagacity, and well acquainted with
the revolutions, to which England was subject, he se∣cretly
apologized to Warwic for this appearance of infi∣delity,
and represented it as proceeding entirely from
zeal for his service. He said, that the place was ill sup∣plied
with provisions; that he could not depend on the
attachment of the garrison; that the inhabitants, who
lived by the English commerce, would certainly declare
for the established government; that the place was at
present unable to resist the power of England on the one
hand, and that of the duke of Burgundy on the other;
and that, by seeming to declare for Edward, he would
acquire the confidence of that prince, and still keep it in
<PB N="248" REF="264"/>
his power, when it should become safe and prudent, to
restore the fortress to its ancient master<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 4. Hall, fol. 205.</NOTE>. It is uncer∣tain,
whether Warwic was satisfied with this apology,
or suspected a double infidelity in Vaucler; but he feign∣ed
to be entirely convinced by him; and having seized
some Flemish vessels which he found lying off Calais, he
immediately made sail towards France.</P>
<P>THE King of France, uneasy at the close conjunction
between Edward and the duke of Burgundy, received
with the greatest demonstrations of regard and friend∣ship
the unfortunate Warwic<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Polyd. Virg. p. 519.</NOTE>, with whom he had for∣merly
maintained a secret correspondence, and whom he
hoped still to make his instrument in overturning the go∣vernment
of England, and re-establishing the house of
Lancaster. No animosity was ever greater than that
which had long prevailed between that house and the
earl of Warwic. His father had been executed by or∣ders
from Margaret: He himself had twice reduced
Henry to captivity, had banished the queen, had put to
death all their most zealous partizans either in the field or
on the scaffold, and had occasioned innumerable ills to that
unhappy family. For this reason, believing that such
inveterate rancour would never admit of any cordial re∣conciliation,
he had not mentioned Henry's name, when
he took arms against Edward; and he rather endea∣voured
to prevail by means of his own adherents, than
revive a party, which he sincerely hated. But his pre∣sent
distresses and the entreaties of Lewis, made him
hearken to terms of accommodation; and Margaret be∣ing
sent for from Angers, where she then resided, an
agreement was from common interest soon formed be∣tween
them. It was stipulated, that Warwic should
<PB N="249" REF="265"/>
adopt the cause of Henry, and endeavour to restore him
to liberty and to re-establish him on the throne; that the
administration of the government, during the minority
of young Edward, Henry's son, should reside conjointly
in the earl of Warwic and the duke of Clarence; that
prince Edward should marry the lady Anne, second
daughter of that nobleman; and that the crown, in case
of the failure of male issue in that prince, should descend
to the duke of Clarence, to the entire exclusion of
King Edward and his posterity. Never was confederacy
on all sides, less natural or more evidently the work of
necessity: But Warwic hoped, that all former passions
of the Lancastrians might be lost in present political
views; and that at worst, the independant power of his
family, and the affections of the people, would be able
to give him security, and enable him to exact the full
performance of all the conditions agreed on. The mar∣riage
of prince Edward with the lady Anne was imme∣diately
celebrated in France.</P>
<P>EDWARD reasonably foresaw, that it would be easy
to dissolve an alliance, composed of such discordant parts.
For this purpose, he sent over a lady of great sagacity
and address, who belonged to the train of the dutchess of
Clarence, and who, under colour of attending her mis∣tress,
was empowered to negotiate with the duke, and
renew the connexions of that prince with his own fa∣mily<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 5. Hall, fol. 207. Holingshed, p. 675.</NOTE>.
She represented to Clarence, that he had unwa∣rily,
to his own ruin, become the instrument of War∣wic's
vengeance, and had thrown himself entirely in the
power of his most inveterate enemies; that the mortal
injuries, which the one royal family had suffered from
the other, were now past all forgiveness, and no idea of
an imaginary union in interests could ever suffice to
<PB N="250" REF="266"/>
obliterate them; that eyen if the leaders were willing
to forget past offences, the animosity of their adherents
would prevent a sincere coalition of parties, and would, in
spi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of all temporary and verbal agreements, preserve an
eternal opposition of measures between them; and that a
prince, who deserted his own kindred, and joined the
murderers of his father, left himself single, without
friends, without protection, and would not, when mis∣fortunes
inevitably fell upon him, be so much as entitled to
any pity or regard from the rest of mankind. Clarence
was only one and twenty years of age, and seems to
have possessed but a slender capacity; yet he could easily
see the force of these reasons; and on the promise of for∣giveness
from his brother, he secretly engaged, on a
favourable opportunity, to desert the earl of Warwic,
and abandon the Lancastrian party.</P>
<P>DURING this negotiation, Warwic was secretly car∣rying
on a correspondence of the same nature with his
brother, the marquess of Montague, who was entirely
trusted by Edward; and like motives produced a like
resolution in that nobleman. The marquess also, that
he might render the projected blow the more deadly and
incurable, resolved, on his side, to watch a favourable
opportunity for committing <HI>his</HI> perfidy, and still to main∣tain
the appearance of being a zealous adherent to the
house of York.</P>
<P>AFTER these mutual snares were thus carefully laid,
the decision of the quarrel advanced apace. Lewis pre∣pared
a fleet to escort the earl of Warwic, and offered
him a supply of men and money<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 4. Hall, fol. 207.</NOTE>. The duke of Bur∣gundy,
on the other hand, enraged at that nobleman for
his seizure of the Flemish ships before Calais, and anxi∣ous
<PB N="251" REF="267"/>
to support the reigning family in England, with
whom his own interests were now connected, fitted out a
larger fleet, with which he guarded the Channel; and
he incessantly warned his brother-in-law of the imminent
perils, to which he was exposed. But Edward, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> al∣ways
brave and often active, had very little foresight or
penetration. He was not sensible of his danger: He
made no suitable preparations against the earl of War∣wic
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 687.</NOTE>: He even said, that the duke might spare himself
the trouble of guarding the seas, and that he wished for
nothing more than to see Warwic set foot on English
ground<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 5. Hall, fol. 208.</NOTE>. A vain confidence in his own prowess, joined
to the immoderate love of pleasure, had made him inca∣pable
of all sound reason and reflection.</P>
<P>THE event soon happened,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. Warwic and Cla∣rence return.</NOTE> of which Edward seemed
so desirous. A storm dispersed the Flemish navy, and
left the seas open to Warwic<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 5.</NOTE>. That nobleman seized
the opportunity, and setting sail, quickly landed at Dart-mouth,
with the duke of Clarence, the earls of Oxford
and Pembroke, and a small body of troops; while the
King was in the north, engaged in suppressing an insur∣rection,
which had been raised by the lord Fitz-Hugh,
brother in law to Warwic. The scene, which ensues,
seems more like the fiction of a poem or romance than
an event in true history. The prodigious popularity of
Warwic<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 205.</NOTE>, the zeal of the Lancastrian party, the spirit
of discontent with which many were infected, and the
general instability of the English nation, occasioned by
the late frequent revolutions, drew such multitudes to
his standard, that in a very few days his army amounted
to sixty thousand men, and was continually encreasing.
<PB N="252" REF="268"/>
Edward hastened southwards to encounter him; and the
two armies approached each other near Nottingham,
where a decisive action was every moment expected.
The rapidity of Warwic's progress had incapacitated
the duke of Clarence from executing <HI>his</HI> plan of treache∣ry;
and the marquess of Montague had here the oppor∣tunity
of striking the first blow. He communicated the
design to his adherents, who promised him their concur∣rence:
They took to arms in the night-time, and hasten∣ed
with loud acclamations to Edward's quarters: The
King was alarmed at the noise, and starting from his
bed, heard the cry of war, usually employed by the
Lancastrian party. Lord Hastings, his chamberlain, in∣formed
him of the danger, and urged him to make his
escape by speedy flight from an army, where he had so
many concealed enemies, and where few seemed to be
zealously attached to his service. He had just time to
get on horseback, and to hurry with a small retinue to
Lynne, in Norfolk, where he luckily found some ships
ready,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Edward IV. expel∣led.</NOTE> on board which he presently embarked<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 5. Hall, fol. 208.</NOTE>. And
after this manner, the earl of Warwic, in no longer space
than eleven days after his first landing, was left entire
master of the kingdom.</P>
<P>BUT Edward's danger did not end with his embarka∣tion.
The Easterlings or Hanse-Towns were then at
war both with France and England; and some ships of
these people, hovering on the English coast, espied the
King's vessels, and gave chace to them; nor was it
without extreme difficulty, that he made his escape into
the port of Alcmaer in Holland. He had fled from
England with such precipitation, that he had carried no∣thing
of value along with him; and the only reward,
<PB N="253" REF="269"/>
which he could bestow on the captain of the vessel, that
brought him over, was a robe, lined with sables; pro∣mising
him an ample recompence, if fortune should ever
become more propitious to him<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is not likely, that Edward could be very fond of
presenting himself in this lamentable condition before the
duke of Burgundy; and that having so suddenly, after
his mighty vaunts, lost all footing in his own kingdom
he could be insensible to the ridicule, which must attend
him in the eyes of that prince. The duke, on his part,
was no less embarrassed how he should receive the de∣throned
monarch. As he had ever borne a greater af∣fection
to the house of Lancaster than to that of York,
nothing but political views had engaged him to contract
an alliance with the latter family; and he foresaw, that
probably the revolution in England would now turn this
alliance against him, and render the reigning family in
that kingdom, his implacable and jealous enemy. For
this reason, when the first rumour of that event reached
him, attended with the circumstance of Edward's death,
he seemed rather pleased with the catastrophe; and it was
no disagreeable disappointment to find, that he must ei∣ther
undergo the burthen of supporting an exiled prince,
or the dishonour of abandoning so near a relation<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Habington, p. 445.</NOTE>. He
began already to say, that his connexions were with the
kingdom of England, not with the King; and that it
was indifferent to him, whether the name of Edward▪ or
that of Henry was employed in the articles of treaty<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 6. Hall, fol. 211.</NOTE>.
These sentiments were continually strengthened by the
subsequent events. Vaucler, the deputy governor of
Calais, tho' he had been confirmed in his command by
Edward, and even received an annual pension from the
<PB N="254" REF="270"/>
duke of Burgundy on account of his fidelity to the
crown<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ton, p. 683.</NOTE>, no sooner saw his old master, Warwic, reinstated
in authority, than he declared for him, and with great
demonstrations of zeal and attachment, put the whole
garrison in his livery<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 6. Hall, fol. 211.</NOTE>. And the intelligence, which the
duke received every day from England, seemed to pro∣mise
an entire and full settlement in the family of Lan∣caster.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after Edward's flight had left the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry VI. restored.</NOTE>
kingdom at Warwic's disposal, that nobleman hastened to
London; and taking Henry from his confinement in
the Tower, into which he had been the chief cause of
throwing him, he proclaimed him King with great so∣lemnity.
A parliament was summoned in the name of
that prince to meet at Westminster; and as this as∣sembly
could pretend to no liberty amidst such enraged
factions, governed by such an impetuous spirit as War∣wic,
their votes were entirely dictated by the ruling par∣ty<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 691. Fabian, fol. 219. Polyd. Virg. p. 521.</NOTE>.
The treaty with Margaret was here fully exe∣cuted:
Henry was recognized for lawful King; but his
incapacity for government being avowed, the regency
was entrusted to Warwic and Clarence till the majority
of prince Edward; and in default of that prince's issue,
Clarence was declared successor to the crown. The usual
business also of reversals went on without opposition:
Every statute, made during the reign of Edward, was
repealed; that prince was declared to be an usurper; he
and his adherents were attainted; and in particular,
Richard, duke of Glocester, his younger brother: All
the attainders of the Lancastrians, the dukes of Somer∣set
<PB N="255" REF="271"/>
and Exeter, the earls of Richmond, Pembroke, Ox∣ford
and Ormond, were reversed; and every one was
restored, who had lost either honours or fortune, by his
former adherence to the cause of Henry.</P>
<P>THE ruling party were more sparing in their execu∣tions,
than was usual after any revolution during those
violent times. The only victim of distinction was John
Tibetot, earl of Worcester, constable of England.
This accomplished person, born in an age and nation
where the nobility valued themselves on ignorance as
their privilege, and left learning to monks and school∣masters,
for whom indeed the spurious erudition that
prevailed, was best fitted, had been struck with the first
rays of true science, which began to penetrate from the
south, and had been zealous, by his exhortations and
example, to propagate the love of letters among his un∣polished
countrymen. It is pretended, that knowledge
had not produced on this nobleman himself, the effect
which so naturally attends it, of humanizing the temper,
and softening the heart<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 210. Stowe, p. 422.</NOTE>; and that he had enraged the
Lancastrians against him, by the severities which he ex∣ercised
upon them, during the prevalence of his own
party. He endeavoured to conceal himself after the flight
of Edward; but was caught on the top of a tree in the
forest of Weybridge, was conducted to London, tried
before the earl of Oxford, condemned and executed.
All the other considerable Yorkists either fled beyond sea,
or took shelter in sanctuaries; where the ecclesiastical
privileges afforded them protection. In London alone,
it is computed, that no less than 2000 persons saved them∣selves
in this manner<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 7.</NOTE>; and among the rest, Edward's
<PB N="256" REF="272"/>
Queen, who was there delivered of a son, called by his
father's name<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 210. Stowe, p. 423. Hollingshed, p. 677. Graf∣ton, p. 690.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>QUEEN Margaret, the other rival Queen, had not yet
appeared in England, but on receiving intelligence of
Warwic's success, was preparing with prince Edward for
her journey. All the banished Lancastrians flocked to
her; and among the rest, the duke of Somerset, son to
the duke beheaded after the battle of Hexham. This
nobleman, who had long been regarded as the head of
the party, had fled into the Low Countries on the dis∣comfiture
of his friends; and as he concealed his name
and quality, he had languished in the most extreme want
and indigence. Philip de Comines tells us<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Liv. 3. chap. 4.</NOTE>, that he him∣self
there saw him, as well as the duke of Exeter, in a
condition no better than that of the meanest beggar;
till being discovered by Philip duke of Burgundy, they
had small pensions allotted them, and were living in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lence and obscurity, when the success of their party
called them from their retreat. But both Somerset and
Margaret were detained by contrary winds, from reaching
England<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 692. Polyd. Virg. p. 522.</NOTE>, till a new revolution in that kingdom, no less
sudden and surprising than the former, threw them into
greater misery than that from which they had just emerged.</P>
<P>THO' the duke of Burgundy, by neglecting Edward,
and paying court to the established government, had
endeavoured to conciliate the friendship of the Lancastri∣ans,
he found that he had not succeeded to his wish; and
the antient connexions between the King of France,
and the earl of Warwic, still held him in great doubt
and anxiety<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 205.</NOTE>. This nobleman, too hastily regarding
<PB N="257" REF="273"/>
Charles as his determined enemy, had sent over to Calais
a body of 4000 men, who committed inroads on the
Low-Countries<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 6.</NOTE>; and the duke of Burgundy saw him∣self
in danger of being oppressed by the united arms of
France and of England. He resolved therefore to grant
some assistance to his brother-in-law; but in such a co∣vert
manner, as should give the least offence possible to
the government of England.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1471.</NOTE> He equipped four large
vessels, in the name of some private merchants, at
Terveer in Zealand; and causing fourteen ships to be
secretly hired of the Easterlings, he delivered this small
squadron to Edward, who, receiving also a sum of money
from the duke, immediately set sail for England. No
sooner was Charles informed of his departure, than he
issued a proclamation inhibiting all his subjects to give
him countenance or assistance<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>; an artifice which could
not blind the earl of Warwic, but which might serve as
a decent pretence, if he was so disposed, for maintaining
friendship with the house of Burgundy.</P>
<P>EDWARD, impatient to take revenge of his enemies,
and to recover his lost authority, made an attempt
to land with his forces, which exceeded not 2000
men, on the coast of Norfolk; but being there repulsed<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Hollingshed, p. 679.</NOTE>,
he sailed northwards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25 March. Edward IV. re∣turns.</NOTE> and disembarked at Ravenspur in
Yorkshire. Finding, that the new magistrates, who
had been placed in authority by the earl of Warwic,
kept the people every where from joining him, he pre∣tended,
and even made oath, that he came not to chal∣lenge
the crown, but only the inheritance of the house
of York, which of right belonged to him, and that he
did not intend to raise a civil war in the kingdom<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 214. Habington, p. 447. Hollingshed, p. 679. Grafton, p. 698. Fabian, fol. 219.</NOTE>. His
<PB N="258" REF="274"/>
partizans every moment flocked to his standard: He was
admitted into the city of York<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Polyd. Virg. p. 524. Leland's collect. vol. ii. p. 504.</NOTE>: And he was soon in a
situation, which gave him hopes of success in all his
claims and pretensions. The marquis of Montague com∣manded
in the northern counties; but from froe myste∣rious
reasons, which, as well as many other important
transactions in that age, no historian has cleared up, he
totally neglected the beginnings of an insurretion,
which he ought to have esteemed so formidable<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 215. Habington, p. 447. Hollingshed, p. 680. Polyd. Virg. p. 524.</NOTE>. War∣wic
assembled an army at Leicester, with an intention
of meeting and of giving battle to the enemy; but
Edward, by taking another road, passed him unmolested,
and presented himself before the gates of London. Had
he here been refused admittance, he was totally ruin∣ed:
But there were many causes, which inclined the
citizens to favour him. His numerous friends, issu∣ing
forth from their sanctuaries, were active in his
cause; many rich merchants, who had formerly lent
him money, saw no other chance for their payment
but his restoration; the city-dames, who had been li∣beral
of their favours to him, and who still retained an
affection for this young and gallant prince, swayed their
husbands and friends in his behalf<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 7.</NOTE>; and above all,
the archbishop of York, Warwic's brother, to whom
the care of the city was committed, had secretly, from
unknown reasons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th April.</NOTE> entered into a correspondence with
him, and he facilitated Edward's admission into London.
The most likely cause, which can be assigned for those
multiplied infidelities, even in the family itself of Nevil, is
the spirit of faction, which, when it becomes inve∣terate,
it is very difficult for any man entirely to shake
<PB N="259" REF="275"/>
off. These persons, who had long distinguished them∣selves
in the York party, were unable to act with zeal
and cordiality for the support of the Lancastrians; and
they were inclined, by every prospect of favour or ac∣commodation,
offered them by Edward, to return to
their antient connexions. However this may be, Ed∣ward's
entrance into London, made him master not only
of that rich and powerful city, but also of the person of
Henry, who, destined to be the perpetual sport of for∣tune,
thus fell again into the hands of his enemies<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 702.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT appears not, that Warwic, during his short admi∣nistration,
which had continued only six months, had
been guilty of any unpopular acts, or had any wise de∣served
to forfeit that general favour, with which he had
so lately overwhelmed Edward. But this prince, who
was formerly the defendant, was now the aggressor;
and having overcome the difficulties, which always at∣tend
the beginnings of an insurrection, possessed many
advantages above his enemy: His partizans were actuated
by that zeal and courage, which the notion of an attack
inspires; his opponents were intimidated for a like rea∣son;
every one, who had been disappointed in the hopes,
which he had entertained from Warwic's elevation, either
became a cool friend, or an open enemy to that noble∣man;
and each malecontent, from whatever cause, proved
an accession to Edward's army. The King, therefore,
found himself in a condition to face the earl of War∣wic,
who, being reinforced by his son-in-law, the duke
of Clarence, and his brother the marquis of Montague,
took post at Barnet, in the neighbourhood of London.
The arrival of Queen Margaret was every day expected,
who would have drawn together all the true Lancastri∣ans,
and have brought a mighty accession to Warwic's
<PB N="260" REF="276"/>
forces▪ But this very consideration proved a motive to
the earl rather to hurry on a decisive action, than to
share the victory with rivals and antient enemies, who,
he foresaw, would, in case of success, claim the chief
merit in the enterprize<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 7.</NOTE>. But while his jealousy was
all directed towards that side, he overlooked the danger∣ous
infidelity of friends, who lay the nearest to his bo∣som.
His brother, Montague, who had lately tempo∣rized,
seems now to have remained sincerely attached to
the interests of his family: But his son-in-law, tho'
bound to him by every tye of honour and gratitude, tho'
he shared the power of the regency, tho' he had been in∣vested
by Warwic in all the honours and patrimony of
the house of York, resolved to fulfil the secret engage∣ments,
which he had formerly taken with his brother,
and to support the interests of his own family: He de∣ferted
to the King in the night-time, and carried over a
body of 12,000 men along with him<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 700. Comines, liv. 3. chap. 7. Leland's Collect. vol. ii. p. 505.</NOTE>. Warwic was
now too far advanced to retreat; and as he rejected with
disdain all terms of peace offered him by Edward and
Clarence, he was obliged to hazard a general engage∣ment.
The battle was fought with great obstinacy on<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th April.</NOTE>
both sides:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Barnet, and death of Warwic.</NOTE> The two armies, in imitation of their lead∣ers,
exerted uncommon acts of valour: And the victory
remained long undecided between them. But an acci∣dent
threw at last the balance to the side of the Yorkists.
Edward's cognisance was a sun; that of Warwic a star
with rays; and the mistiness of the morning rendering
it difficult to distinguish them, John earl of Oxford, who
fought on the side of the Lancastrians, was, by mistake,
attacked by his friends, and chaced off the field of battle<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Habington, p. 449.</NOTE>.
<PB N="261" REF="277"/>
Warwic, contrary to his more usual practice, engaged
that day on foot, resolving to show his army, that he
meant to share every fortune with them, and he was
slain in the thickest of the engagement<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 7.</NOTE>: His brother
underwent the same fate: And as Edward had issued or∣ders
not to give any quarter, a great and undistinguished
slaughter was made in the pursuit<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 218.</NOTE>. There fell about
1500 on the side of the conquerors.</P>
<P>THE same day that this decisive battle was fought<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Leland's Collect. vol. ii. p. 505.</NOTE>,
Queen Margaret and her son, now about eighteen years
of age, and a very promising youth, arrived at Wey∣mouth,
supported by a small body of French forces.
When this princess received intelligence of her husband's
captivity, and of the defeat and death of the earl of
Warwic, her courage, which had supported her under
so many disastrous events, here quite left her; and she
immediately foresaw all the dismal consequences of this
calamity. She took sanctuary at first in the abbey of
Beaulieu<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 219. Habington, p. 451. Grafton, p. 706. Polyd. Virg. p. 528.</NOTE>; but being encouraged by the appearance of
Tudor, earl of Pembroke, and Courtney, earl of Devon∣shire,
of the lords Wenloc and St. John, with other
men of rank, who exhorted her still to hope for success,
she resumed her former spirit, and determined to defend
to the utmost the ruins of her fallen fortunes. She ad∣vanced
thro' the counties of Devon, Somerset, and Glo∣cester,
encreasing her army on each day's march; but
was at last overtaken by the rapid and expeditious Ed∣ward,
at Teukes∣bury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Teukesbury.</NOTE> on the banks of the Severne.
The Lancastrians were here totally defeated: The earl
of Devonshire and lord Wenloc were killed in the field:<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th May.</NOTE>
<PB N="262" REF="278"/>
The duke of Somerset, and about twenty other persons
of distinction, having taken shelter in a church, were
surrounded, dragged out, and immediately beheaded:
About 3000 of their side fell in battle: And the army
was entirely dispersed.</P>
<P>QUEEN Margaret and her son were taken prisoners,
and brought to the King, who asked the prince, after an
insulting manner, how he dared to invade his dominions?
The young prince, more mindful of his high birth than
of his present fortune, replied, that he came thither to
claim his just inheritance. The ungenerous Edward,
insensible to pity, struck him on the face with his gaunt∣let;
and the dukes of Clarence and Glocester, lord
Hastings and Sir Thomas Gray, taking the blow as a
signal for farther violence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of prince Ed∣ward.</NOTE> hurried the prince into the
next apartment, and there dispatched him with their
daggers<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 221. Habington, p. 453. Hollingshed, p. 688. Polyd. Virg. p. 530.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">21st May.</NOTE> Margaret was thrown into the Tower: King
Henry expired in that confinement a few days after the
battle of Teukesbury; but whether he died of a natural
or violent death is uncertain.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of Henry VI.</NOTE> It is pretended, and was
generally believed, that the duke of Glocester killed him
with his own hands<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Comines, Hall, fol. 223. Grafton, p. 703.</NOTE>: But the universal odium under
which that prince's memory deservedly labours, inclined
perhaps the nation to aggravate his crimes without any
sufficient authority. It is certain, however, that Hen∣ry's
death was very sudden; and tho' he laboured before
under an ill state of health, this circumstance, joined to
the general manners of the age, gave a very natural
ground of suspicion; which was rather increased than
diminished, by the exposing of his body to public view.
<PB N="263" REF="279"/>
That precaution served only to recal many similar in∣stances
in the English history, and to suggest the com∣parison.</P>
<P>ALL the hopes of the Lancastrians seemed now to be
utterly extinguished. Every legitimate prince of that
family was dead: Almost all the great leaders of the
party had perished in battle or on the scaffold: Jasper,
earl of Pembroke, who was levying forces in Wales,
dispersed his army, when he received intelligence of the
battle of Teukesbury; and he fled into Brittany with
his nephew, the young earl of Richmond<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Habington, p. 454. Polyd. Virg. p. 531.</NOTE>. The bastard
of Falconbridge, who had levied some forces, and ad∣vanced
to London during Edward's absence, was repulsed;
his men deserted him; he was taken prisoner and imme∣diately
executed<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Hollingshed, p. 689, 690, 693. Hist. Croyl. cont. p. 554.</NOTE>: And peace being how fully restored
to the nation, a parliament was summoned, which ra∣tified,
as usual,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th Octob.</NOTE> all the acts of the victor, and recognized
his legal authority.</P>
<P>BUT this prince, who had been so firm and active,
and intrepid during the course of adversity, was still un∣able
to resist the allurements of a prosoerpus fortune;
and he wholly devoted himself, as before, to pleasure and
amusement, after he became entirely master of his king∣dom,
and had no longer any enemy who could give him
anxiety or alarm. He recovered, however, by this gay
and inoffensive course of life, and by his easy, familiar
manners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1472.</NOTE> that popularity, which it it is natural to ima∣gine,
he had lost by the repeated cruelties exercised upon
his enemies; and the example also of his jovial festivity,
served to abate the former acrimony of faction among
his subjects, and to restore the social disposition, which
<PB N="264" REF="280"/>
had been so long interrupted between the opposite parties.
All men seemed to be fully satisfied with the present go∣vernment;
and the memory of past calamities served only
to impress the people more strongly with a sense of their
allegiance, and with the resolution of never incurring any
more the hazard of renewing such direful scenes.</P>
<P>BUT while the King was thus indulging himself in
pleasure, he was rouzed from the lethargy by a prospect
of foreign conquests, which, it is probable, his desire
of popularity, more than the spirit of ambition, had
made him covet. Tho' he deemed himself very little be∣holden
to the duke of Burgundy, for the reception which
that prince had given him during his exile<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 7.</NOTE>, the politi∣cal
interests of their states maintained still a close con∣nexion
between them; and they agreed to unite their
arms in making a powerful invasion on France. A league
was formed, in which Edward stipulated to pass the seas
with an army, exceeding 10,000 men, and to invade the
French territories: Charles promised to join him with all
his forces: The King was to challenge the crown of
France, and to obtain at least the provinces of Nor∣mandy
and Guienne: The duke was to acquire Cham∣paigne
and some other territories, and to free all his do∣minions
from the burthen of homage to the crown of
France: And neither party was to make peace without
the consent of the other<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xi. P. 806, 807, 808, &amp;c.</NOTE>. They were the more encour∣aged
to hope for success from this league, as the count de
St. Pol, constable of France, who was master of St.
Quintin, and some towns on the Somme, had secretly
promised them his assistance; and there were also hopes
of engaging the duke of Brittany to enter into the con∣federacy.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="281"/>
THE prospect of a French war was always a sure
means of making the parliament open their purses, as
far as the habits of that age would permit.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1474.</NOTE> They voted
the King a tenth of rents, or two shillings in the pound;
which must have been very inaccurately levied, since it
produced only 31,460 pounds; and they added to this
supply a whole fifteenth, and three quarters of another<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 696, 700. Hist. Croyl. cont. p. 558.</NOTE>:
But as the King deemed these sums still unequal to the
undertaking, he attempted to levy money by the way of
<HI>benevolence;</HI> a fort of exaction, which, except during the
reign of Richard II. had scarce ever been practised in
former times, and which, tho' the consent of the parties
was pretended to be gained, could not be esteemed en∣tirely
voluntary<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 226. Habington, p. 461. Grafton, p. 719. Fabian, fol. 221.</NOTE>. The clauses, annexed to the par∣liamentary
grant, show sufficiently the spirit of the na∣tion
in this respect. The money levied by the fifteenth
was not to be put into the King's hands, but to be kept
in religious houses; and if the expedition into France
did not take place, it was immediately to be refunded to
the people. After these grants, the parliament was dis∣solved,
which had sat near two years and a half, and
had undergone several prorogations; a practice not very
usual at that time in England.</P>
<P>THE King passed over to Calais with an army of<NOTE PLACE="marg">1475.</NOTE>
1500 men at arms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasion of France.</NOTE> and 15000 archers; attended with
all the chief nobility of England, who, prognosticating
future successes from the past, were eager to appear in
this great theatre of honour<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 4. chap. 5. This author says, (chap. II.) that the King artfully brought over some of the richest of his subjects, who, he knew, would he soon tired of the war, and would promote all proposals of peace, which he foresaw, would be soon necessary.</NOTE>. But all their sanguine
<PB N="266" REF="282"/>
hopes were damped, when they found, on entering the
French territories, that neither the constable opened his
gates to them, nor did the duke of Burgundy bring them
the smallest assistance. That prince, transported by his
ardent temper, had carried all his armies to a great di∣stance,
and had employed them in wars on the frontiers
of Germany, and against the duke of Lorrain; and tho'
he came in person to Edward, and endeavoured to apo∣logize
for this breach of treaty, there was no prospect
that they would be able this campaign to make a con∣junction
with the English. This circumstance gave
great disgust to the King, and inclined him to hearken
to those advances, which Lewis continually made him for
an accommodation.</P>
<P>THAT monarch, more swayed by political views than
by the point of honour, deemed no submissions too mean,
which, could free him from enemies, who had proved
so formidable to his predecessors, and who, united to
so many other enemies, might still shake the well∣established
government of France. It appears from
Comines, that discipline was, at this time, very im∣perfect
among the English; and that their civil wars,
tho' long continued, yet, being always decided by hasty
battles, had still left them ignorant of the improvements,
which the military art was beginning to receive upon the
continent<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 4. chap. 5.</NOTE>. But as Lewis was sensible, that the war∣like
genius of the people would soon render them ex∣cellent
soldiers, he was far from despising them for their
present want of experience; and he employed all his
art to detach them from their alliance with Bur∣gundy.
When Edward sent a herald to claim the
crown of France, and to carry him a defiance in
case of refusal; so far from answering to this bravade in
<PB N="267" REF="283"/>
like haughty terms, he relied with great temper, and
even made the herald a considerable present<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 4. chap. 5. Hall, fol. 227.</NOTE>: He took
afterwards an opportunity of sending a herald to the
English camp; and giving him directions to apply to
the lords Stanley and Howard, who, he heard, were
friends to peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th Au∣gust.</NOTE> he desired the good offices of these
noblemen in promoting an accommodation with their
master<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 4. chap. 7.</NOTE>. As Edward was now fallen into like dispo∣sitions,
a truce was soon concluded on terms more ad∣vantageous
than honourable to Lewis. He stipulated to
pay Edward immediately 75,000 crowns, on condition
that he should withdraw his army from France, and
promised to pay him 50,000 crowns a year during
their joint lives:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace of Pecquigni.</NOTE> It was added, that the Dauphin, when
of age, should marry Edward's eldest daughter<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xii. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7.</NOTE>. In
order to ratify this treaty, the two monarchs agreed to
have a personal interview; and for this purpose, suitable
preparations were made at Pecquigni near Amiens: A
close rail was drawn across a bridge in that place, with
no larger intervals than would allow the arm to pass;
a precaution which was used to prevent a like accident
with that which happened to John Duke of Burgundy
in his conference with the Dauphin at Montereau. Ed∣ward
and Lewis came to the opposite sides; conferred
privately together; and having confirmed their friend∣ship,
and interchanged many mutual civilities, they soon
after parted<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 4. chap. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LEWIS was anxious not only to gain the King's
friendship; but also that of the nation, and of all the
considerable persons in the English court. He bestowed
pensions, to the amount of 16,000 crowns a year, on se∣veral
of the King's favourites; on lord Hastings two
<PB N="268" REF="284"/>
thousand crowns; on lord Howard and others in pro∣portion;
and these great ministers were not ashamed
thus to receive wages from a foreign prince<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 235.</NOTE>. As the
two armies, after the conclusion of the truce, remained
some time in the neighbourhood of each other, the Eng∣lish
were not only admitted freely into Amiens, where
Lewis resided, but had also all their charges defrayed,
and had wine and victuals furnished them in every inn,
without any payments being demanded. They flocked
thither in such multitudes, that once above nine thou∣sand
of them were in the town, and they might have
made themselves masters of the King's person; but
Lewis, concluding from their careless and dissolute man∣ner
of living, that they had no bad intentions, was care∣ful
not to betray the least signs of fear or jealousy. And
when Edward, informed of this disorder, desired him to
shut the gates against them; he replied, that he would
never agree to exclude the English from the place where
he resided; but Edward, if he pleased, might recall
them, and place his own officers at the gates of Amiens
to prevent their returning<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 4. chap. 9. Hall, fol. 233.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LEWIS'S desire of confirming a mutual amity with
England, engaged him even to make imprudent ad∣vances,
which cost him afterwards some pains to evade.
In the conference at Pecquigni, he had said to Edward,
that he wished to have a visit from him at Paris; that he
would there endeavour to amuse him with the ladies;
and that, in case any offences were then committed,
he would assign him the cardinal of Bourbon for con∣fessor,
who, from fellow-feeling, would not be over and
above severe in the penances, which he would injoin.
This hint made deeper impressions than Lewis intended.
<PB N="269" REF="285"/>
Lord Howard, who accompanied him back to Amiens,
told him, in confidence, that, if he was so disposed, it
would not be impossible to persuade Edward to take a
journey with him to Paris, where they might make merry
together. Lewis pretended at first not to hear this offer;
but his Howard's repeating it, he expressed his concern,
that his wars with the duke of Burgundy would not
permit him to attend his royal guest, and do him the ho∣nours
he intended, “Edward,” said he, privately to Co∣mines,
“is a very handsome and a very amorous prince:
Some lady at Paris may like him as well as he shall
do her; and may invite him to return in another man∣ner.
It is better that the sea should be between us<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 4. chap. 10. Habington, p. 469.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THIS treaty did very little honour to either of these
monarchs: It discovered the imprudence of Edward,
who had taken his measures so ill with his allies, as to
be obliged, after such expensive preparations, to return
without making any acquisitions, equivalent to them:
It showed the want of dignity in Lewis, who, rather
than run the hazard of a battle, agreed to subject his
kingdom to a tribute, and thus acknowledge the supe∣riority
of a neighbouring prince, possessed of much less
power and territory than himself. But as Lewis made
interest the sole test of honour, he thought, that all the
advantages of the treaty were on his side, and that he
had over-reached Edward by sending him out of France
on such easy terms. For this reason, he was very solicitous
to conceal his triumph; and he strictly enjoined his cour∣tiers
never to show the English the least sign of mockery or
ridicule against them. But he did not himself very care∣fully
observe so prudent a rule: He could not forbear,
one day, in the joy of his heart, throwing out some
raillery on the easy simplicity of Edward and his coun∣cil:
<PB N="270" REF="286"/>
When he perceived, that he was overheard by a
Gascon, who had settled in England. He was imme∣diately
sensible of the blunder; sent a message to the
gentleman; and offered him such advantages in his own
country, as engaged him to remain in France. <HI>It is
but just,</HI> said he, <HI>that I pay the penalty of my talkativeness</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE most honourable part of Lewis's treaty with
Edward was the stipulation for the liberty of Queen
Margaret, who, tho' after the death of her husband and
son, she could no longer be formidable to the govern∣ment,
was still detained in custody by Edward. Lewis
paid fifty thousand crowns for her ransom; and that
princess, who had been so active in the stage of the
world, and who had experienced such a variety of
fortune, passed the rest of her days in tranquility
and privacy, till the year 1482, when she died: An
admirable princess, but more illustrious by her undaunted
spirit in adversity, than by her moderation in prosperity.
She seems neither to have enjoyed the virtues, nor been
subject to the weaknesses of her sex; and was as much
tainted with the ferocity, as endowed with the courage,
of that barbarous age in which she lived.</P>
<P>THO' Edward had so little reason to be satisfied with
the conduct of the duke of Burgundy, he reserved to
that prince a power of acceding to the treaty of Amiens:
But Charles, when the offer was made him, haughtily
replied, that he was able to support himself without the
assistance of England, and that he would make no peace
with Lewis, till three months after Edward's return into
his own country. This prince possessed all the ambi∣tion
and courage of a conqueror; but being defective in
policy and prudence, qualities no less essential, he was
<PB N="271" REF="287"/>
unfortunate in all his enterprizes; and perished at last
in battle against the Swiss<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 5. chap. 8.</NOTE>; a people, whom he de∣spised,
and who, tho' brave and free, had hitherto been
in a manner overlooked in the general system of Europe.
This event,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1477.</NOTE> which happened in the year 1477, produced
a great alteration in the views of all the princes, and was
attended with consequences which were felt for many
generations. Charles left only one daughter, Mary, by
his first wife; and this princess being heir of his opulent
and extensive dominions, was courted by all the poten∣tates
of Christendom, who contended with each other
for the possession of so rich a prize. Lewis, the head of
her family, might, by a proper application, have ob∣tained
this match for the Dauphin, and have thereby
united to the clown of France all the provinces of the
Low Countries, together with Burgundy, Artois, and
Picardy; which would at once have rendered his king∣dom
an overmatch for all his neighbours. But a man
wholly interested is as rare as one entirely endowed with
the opposite virtue; and Lewis, though impregnable to
all the sentiments of generosity and friendship, was,
on this occasion, carried from the road of true po∣licy
by the passions of animosity and revenge. He had
imbibed so deep a hatred of the house of Burgundy, that
he chose rather to subdue the princess by force of arms,
than unite her to his family by marriage: He con∣quered
the dutchy of Burgundy and that part of Pi∣cardy,
which had been ceded to Philip the Good by the
treaty of Arras: But he forced the states of the Nether∣lands
to bestow their sovereign in marriage on Maxi∣milian
of Austria, son to the emperor, Frederic, from
whom they looked for protection in their present di∣stresses:
<PB N="272" REF="288"/>
And by these means, France lost the opportu∣nity,
which she never could recover, of making that im∣portant
acquisition of power and territory.</P>
<P>DURING this interesting crisis, Edward was no less
defective in policy, and was no less actuated by private
passions, unworthy of a sovereign and a statesman. Jea∣lousy
of his brother, Clarence, had caused him to neglect
the advances which were made of marrying that prince,
now a widower, to the heiress of Burgundy<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Polyd. Virg. Hall, fol. 240. Holingshed, p. 703. Habington, p. 474. Grafton, p. 742.</NOTE>; and he
sent her proposals of espousing Anthony earl of Ri∣vers,
brother to his queen, who still retained an entire
ascendant over him. But the match was rejected with
disdain<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 240.</NOTE>; and Edward resenting this treatment of his
brother-in-law, permitted Lewis to proceed without in∣terruption
in his conquests over that defenceless ally.
Any pretence sufficed him for giving himself up entirely
to indolence and pleasure, which were now become his
ruling passions. The only object, which divided his
attention, was the improving the revenues of the crown,
which had been extremely dilapidated by the necessities
or negligence of his predecessors; and some of his expe∣dients
for that purpose, tho' unknown to us, were deem∣ed,
during the time, oppressive to the people<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 241. Hist. Croyl, cont. p. 559.</NOTE>. The
detail of private wrongs naturally escapes the notice of
history; but an act of tyranny, of which Edward was
guilty in his own family, has been taken notice of by all
historians, and has met with very general and deserved
censure.</P>
<P>THE duke of Clarence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial and execution of the duke of Clarence.</NOTE> by all his services in deserting
Warwic, had never been able to recover the King's
friendship, which he had forfeited by his former confede∣racy
<PB N="273" REF="289"/>
with that nobleman. He was still regarded at
court as a man of a dangerous and a fickle character; and
the imprudent openness and violence of his temper, tho'
it rendered him much less dangerous, tended extremely
to multiply his enemies, and to enrage them against him.
Among these, he had had the misfortune to give dis∣pleasure
to the queen herself, as well as to his brother,
the duke of Glocester, a prince of the deepest policy, of
the most unrelenting ambition, and the least scrupulous
in the means which he employed for the attainment of
his pernicious purposes. A combination between these
potent adversaries being secretly formed against Clarence,
it was determined to begin with attacking his friends;
in hopes, that, if he patiently endured this injury, his
pusillanimity would dishonour him in the eyes of the
public; if he made resistance and expressed resentment,
his passion would betray him into measures, which might
give them advantages against him. The King, hunting
one day in the park of Thomas Burdet of Arrow, in
Warwickshire, had killed a white buck, which was a
great favourite of the owner; and Burdet, vexed at the
loss, broke into a passion, and wished the horns of the
deer in the belly of the person who had advised the King
to commit that insult upon him. This natural expression
of resentment, which would have been overlooked or
forgotten, had it come from any other person, was ren∣dered
criminal and capital in that gentleman, by the
friendship in which he had the misfortune to live with
the duke of Clarence: He was tried for his life; the
judges and jury were found servile enough to condemn
him; and he was publickly beheaded at Tyburn for
this pretended offence<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Habington, p. 475. Holingshed, p. 703. Sir Thomas More in Kennet, p. 498.</NOTE>. About the same time, one
<PB N="274" REF="290"/>
John Stacey, an ecclesiastic, much connected with the
duke, as well as with Burdet, was exposed to a like
iniquitous and barbarous persecution. This person, be∣ing
more learned in mathematics and astronomy than was
usual in that age, lay under the reproach of necromancy
with the ignorant vulgar; and the tyrannical court laid
hold of this popular rumour to effect his destruction.
He was tried in a court of justice for that imaginary
crime; many of the greatest peers countenanced the pro∣secution
by their presence; he was condemned, put to
the torture, and executed<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Hist. Croyl. Cont. p. 561.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Clarence was alarmed, when he found
these acts of tyranny exercised on all around him: He
reflected on the fate of the good duke of Glocester in
the last reign, who, after seeing the most infamous pre∣tences
employed for the destruction of his nearest con∣nections,
at last fell himself a victim to the vengeance of
his enemies. But Clarence, instead of securing his own
life against the present danger, by silence and reserve,
was open and loud in justifying the innocence of his
friends, and in exclaiming against the iniquity of their
persecutors. The King, highly offended with his liberty,
or using that pretence against him, committed him to the
Tower<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 562.</NOTE>, summoned a parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1478.</NOTE> and tried him for his
life before the house of peers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th Jan.</NOTE> the supreme tribunal of
the nation.</P>
<P>THE duke was accused of arraigning public justice,
by maintaining the innocence of men, who had been
condemned in courts of judicature, and of inveighing
against the iniquity of the King, who had given orders
for their prosecution<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 430.</NOTE>. Many rash expressions were im∣puted
<PB N="275" REF="291"/>
to him, and some too reflecting on his brother's
legitimacy; but he was not accused of any overt act of
treason; and even the truth of these speeches may be
doubted, since the liberty of judgment was taken from
the court, by the King's appearing personally as his
brother's accuser<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hist. Croyl. cont. p. 562.</NOTE>, and pleading the cause against him.
But a sentence of condemnation, even when this extra∣ordinary
circumstance had not place, was a necessary
consequence, in those times, of any prosecution by the
court or the prevailing party; and the duke of Clarence
was accordingly pronounced guilty by the peers. The
house of commons were no less slavish and unjust:
They both petitioned for the execution of the duke,
and afterwards passed a bill of attainder against him<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 430. Hist. Croyl. cont. p. 562.</NOTE>.
The measures of the parliament, during that age, furnish
us with examples of a strange contrast of freedom and
servility: They scruple to grant, and sometimes refuse
to the King the smallest supplies, the most necessary
for the support of government, even the most necessary
for the maintenance of wars, for which the nation, as
well as the parliament itself, expressed a great fondness:
But they never scruple to concur in the most flagrant
act of injustice or tyranny, which falls on any indivi∣dual,
however distinguished by birth or merit. These
maxims, so ungenerous, so opposite to all the principles
of good government, so contrary to the practice of pre∣sent
parliaments, are very remarkable in all the trans∣actions
of the English history for more than a century
after the period, in which we are now engaged.</P>
<P>THE only favour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th Feb.</NOTE> which the King granted his bro∣ther
after his condemnation, was to leave him the choice
<PB N="274" REF="292"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="275" REF="293"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="276" REF="294"/>
of his death; and he was privately drowned in a butt of
Malmesey in the Tower: A whimsical choice, which
implies that he had an extraordinary passion for that
liquor. The duke left two children, by the eldest
daughter of the earl of Warwic, a son created an earl
by his grandfather's title; and a daughter, afterwards
countess of Salisbury. Both this prince and princess
were also unfortunate in their end, and died violent
deaths; a fate which, for many years, attended almost
all the descendants of the royal blood in England. There
prevails a report, that a chief source of the violent pro∣secution
of the duke of Clarence, whose name was
George, was a current prophecy, that the King's sons
should be murdered by one, the first letter of whose
name was G<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 239. Holingshed, p. 703. Grafton, p. 741. Polyd Virg. p. 537. Sir Thomas More in Kennet, p. 497.</NOTE>. It is not impossible, that in those igno∣rant
times, such a silly rsextremelyeason might have influence:
But it is more probable, that the whole story is the inven∣tion
of a subsequent age, and founded on the murder of
these children by the duke of Glocester. Comines re∣marks,
that at that time, the English were never with∣out
some superstitious prophecy or other, by which they
accounted for every event.</P>
<P>ALL the glories of Edward's reign terminated with
the civil wars; where his laurels too were extremely
sullied with blood, violence and cruelty. His spirit
seems afterwards to be sunk in indolence and pleasure, or
his measures were frustrated by imprudence and the want of
foresight. There was no object of which he was fonder
than to have all his daughters settled by splendid marriages,
tho' most of these princesses were yet in their infancy,
and tho' the completion of his views, it was obvious,
must depend on numberless accidents, which were im∣possible
<PB N="277" REF="295"/>
possible to be foreseen or prevented. His eldest daugh∣ter,
Elizabeth, was contracted to the Dauphin; his se∣cond,
Cicely, to the eldest son of James III. King of
Scotland; his third, Anne, to Philip, the eldest son of
Maximilian and the dutchess of Burgundy; his fourth,
Catharine, to John, son and heir to Ferdinand, King
of Arragon, and Isabella, Queen of Castile<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xi. p. 110.</NOTE>. None of
these projected marriages took place; and the King
himself saw in his life-time the rupture of the first, that
with the Dauphin, for which he had always discovered a
peculiar fondness. Lewis, who paid no regard to trea∣ties
or engagements, found his advantage in contracting
the Dauphin to the princess Margaret, the daughter of
Maximilian; and the King, notwithstanding his indo∣lence,
prepared himself to revenge this indignity. The
French monarch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1482.</NOTE> eminent for prudence, as well as false∣hood,
endeavoured to guard against the blow; and by
a proper distribution of presents in the court of Scot∣land,
he excited James to make war upon England.
This weak prince, who lived on bad terms with his own
nobility, and whose force was very unequal to the enter∣prize,
levied an army; but when they were preparing
to enter England, the barons, conspiring against his
favourites, put them to death without trial; and the
army presently dispersed. The duke of Glocester, at∣tended
by the duke of Albany, James's brother, who had
been banished his country, entered Scotland at the head
of an army, took Berwic, and obliged the Scots to ac∣cept
of a peace, by which they resigned that fortress to
Edward. This success emboldened the King to think
more seriously of a French war; but while he was making
preparations for that enterprize, he was seized with a
distemper, of which he expired in the forty-second year
<PB N="278" REF="296"/>
of his age, and the twenty-third of his reign: A prince
more splendid and showy, than either prudent or virtuous;
brave, tho' cruel; addicted to pleasure, tho' capable of
activity in great emergencies;<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th April. Death and character of Edward IV.</NOTE> and less fitted to prevent ills
by wise precautions, than to remedy them, after
they took place, by his vigour and enterprize. Besides
five daughters, this King left two sons; Edward, prince
of Wales, his successor, then in his thirteenth year, and
Richard, duke of York, in his seventh.</P>

who envied the sudden growth and unlimited credit of
that aspiring family<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Sir Thomas More, p. 481</NOTE>. At the head of this latter party
was the duke of Buckingham, a man of very noble birth,
<PB N="280" REF="298"/>
of ample possessions, of great alliances, of shining parts;
who, tho' he had married the Queen's sister, was too
haughty to act in subserviency to her inclinations, and
aimed rather at maintaining an independant influence and
authority. Lord Hastings, the chamberlain, was another
leader of the same party; and as this nobleman had, by
his bravery and enterprize, as well as by his approved
fidelity, acquired the confidence and favour of his master,
he had been able, tho' with some difficulty, to support
himself against the credit of the Queen. The lords
Howard and Stanley maintained a connexion with these
two noblemen, and brought a considerable accession of
influence and credit to their party. All the other barons,
who had no particular dependance on the Queen, ad∣hered
to the same interest; and the people in general,
from their natural envy against the prevailing power,
bore great favour to the cause of these noblemen.</P>
<P>BUT Edward knew, that, tho' he himself had been
able to overawe those rival factions, many disorders might
result from their contests during the minority of his son;
and he therefore took care, in his last illness, to summon
together several of the leaders on both sides, and, by
composing their antient quarrels, to provide, as far as
possible, for the future tranquillity of the government.
After expressing his intentions, that his brother, the duke
of Glocester, then absent in the north, should be en∣trusted
with the regency, he recommended to them peace
and unanimity during the tender years of his son;
represented to them the dangers which must attend the
continuance of their animosities; and engaged them to
embrace each other with all the symptoms of the most
cordial reconciliation. But this temporary or feigned
agreement lasted no longer than the King's life: He had
no sooner expired, than the jealousies of the parties broke
<PB N="281" REF="299"/>
out afresh: And each of them applied, by separate mes∣sages,
to the duke of Glocester, and endeavoured to ac∣quire
his favour and friendship.</P>
<P>THIS prince, during his brother's lifetime, had en∣deavoured
to live on good terms with both parties; and
his high birth, his extensive abilities, and his great ser∣vices,
had enabled him to support himself without falling
into a dependance on either. But the new situation of
affairs, when the supreme power was devolved upon him,
immediately changed all his measures; and he secretly
determined to preserve no longer that neutrality which he
had hitherto maintained. His exorbitant ambition, unre∣strained
by any principle either of justice or humanity, made
him carry his views to the possession of the crown itself;
and as this object could not be attained without the ruin
of the Queen and her family, he fell, without hesitation,
into concert with the opposite party. But being sensible,
that the most profound dissimulation was requisite to the
effecting his criminal purposes, he redoubled his profes∣sions
of zeal and attachment to that princess; and he
gained such credit with her, as to influence her conduct
in a point, which, as it was of the utmost importance,
was violently disputed between the opposite factions.</P>
<P>THE King, at the time of his father's deaths, resided
in the castle of Ludlow, on the borders of Wales; whi∣ther
he had been sent, that the influence of his presence
might overawe the Welsh, and restore the tranquillity of
that country, which had been disturbed by some late
commotions. His person was committed to the care of
his uncle, the earl of Rivers, the most accomplished
nobleman in England, who, having united an uncom∣mon
taste for literature<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This nobleman first introduced the noble art of Printing into England. Caxton was recommended by him to the patronage of Edward IV. See Catalogue of royal and noble authors.</NOTE> to great abilities in business, and
<PB N="282" REF="300"/>
valour in the field, was intitled, by his talents, still
more than by nearness of blood, to direct the education
of the young monarch. The Queen, anxious to pre∣serve
that ascendant over her son, which she had so long
maintained over her husband, wrote to the earl of Rivers,
that he should levy a body of forces, in order to escort
the King to London, to protect him during his corona∣tion,
and to keep him from falling into the hands of their
enemies. The opposite faction, sensible that Edward
was now of an age when great advantages could be made
of his name and countenance, and was approaching to
the age when he would be legally intitled to exert in per∣son
his authority, foresaw, that the tendency of this
measure was to perpetuate their subjection under their
rivals; and they vehemently opposed a resolution, which
they represented as the signal for renewing a civil war
in the kingdom. Lord Hastings threatened instantly to
depart to his government of Calais<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hist. Croyl. cont. p. 564, 565.</NOTE>: The other nobles
seemed resolute to oppose force by force: And as the
duke of Glocester, on pretence of pacifying the quarrel,
had declared against all appearance of an armed power,
which might be dangerous, and was nowife necessary,
the Queen, trusting to the sincerity of his friendship,
and overawed by so violent an opposition, revoked her orders
to her brother, and desired him to bring up no greater
retinue than would be necessary to support the state and
dignity of the young sovereign<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Sir T. More, p. 483.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Glocester, meanwhile, set out from
York, attended by a numerous train of the northern
gentry. When he reached Northampton, he was joined
by the duke of Buckingham, who was also attended by
a splendid retinue; and as he heard, that the King was
every hour expected on that road, he resolved to await
<PB N="283" REF="301"/>
his arrival, under colour of conducting him thence in
person to London. The earl of Rivers, apprehensive
that the place would be too narrow to contain so many
attendants, sent his pupil forward by another road to
Stony-Stratford; and came himself to Northampton, in
order to apologize for this measure, and to pay his respects
to the duke of Glocester. He was received with the
greatest appearance of cordiality: He passed the evening
in an amicable and friendly manner with Glocester and
Buckingham: He proceeded on the road with them next
day to join the King: But as he was entering Stony-Stratford,
he was arrested by orders of the duke of Glo∣cester<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hist. Croyl. cont. p. 564, 565.</NOTE>:
Sir Richard Gray,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The earl of Rivers ar∣rested. 1st of May.</NOTE> one of the Queen's sons,
was at the same time put under a guard, together with
Sir Thomas Vaughan, who possessed a considerable office
in the King's houshold; and all the prisoners were in∣stantly
conducted to Pomfret. Glocester approached the
young prince with the greatest demonstrations of respect;
and endeavoured to satisfy him with regard to the violence
committed on his uncle and brother: But Edward, much
attached to these near relations, by whom he had been
tenderly educated, was not such a master of dissimula∣tion
as to conceal his displeasure<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Sir T. More, p. 484.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE people, however, were extremely rejoiced at this
revolution;<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th May.</NOTE> and the duke was received in London with
the loudest acclamations: But the Queen no sooner re∣ceived
intelligence of her brother's imprisonment, than
she foresaw, that Glocester's violence would not stop
there, and that her own ruin, if not that of all her child∣ren,
was finally determined. She therefore fled into
the sanctuary of Westminster, attended by the marquis
of Dorset; and she carried thither the five princesses to∣gether
<PB N="284" REF="302"/>
with the duke of York<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hist. Croyl. cont, p. 565.</NOTE>. She trusted, that the
ecclesiastical privileges, which had formerly, during the
total ruin of her husband and family, given her protection
against the fury of the Lancastrian faction, would not
now be violated by her brother-in-law, while her son
was seated on the throne; and she resolved to await
there the return of better fortune. But Glocester, an∣xious
to have the duke of York in his power, proposed
to take him by force from the sanctuary; and he repre∣sented
to the privy council, both the indignity put upon
the government by the Queen's ill-grounded apprehen∣sions,
and the necessity of the young prince's appearance
at the ensuing coronation of his brother. It was farther
alledged, that ecclesiastical privileges were originally cal∣culated
only to give protection to unhappy men, perse∣cuted
for their debts or crimes; and were entirely useless
to a person, who, by reason of his tender age, could lie
under the burden of neither, and who, for the same
reason, was utterly incapable of claiming security from
any sanctuary. But the two archbishops, cardinal Bour∣chier,
the primate, and Rotheram archbishop of York,
protesting against the sacrilege of this measure; it was
agreed, that they should first endeavour to bring the
Queen to compliance by persuasion, before any violence
should be employed against her. These prelates were
known to be persons of integrity and honour; and being
themselves entirely persuaded of the sincerity of the
duke's intentions, they employed every argument, ac∣companied
with zealous entreaties, exhortations, and
assurances, to bring her over to the same opinion. She
continued long obstinate, and insisted, that the duke of
York, by living in the sanctuary, was not only secure
himself, but gave also security to the King, whose life
<PB N="285" REF="303"/>
no one would dare to attempt, while his successor and
avenger remained in safety. But finding, that no one
supported her in her sentiments, and that force, in case
of refusal, was threatened by the council, she at last
complied, and produced her son to the two prelates.
She was here on a sudden struck with a kind of presage
of his future fate: She tenderly embraced him; she be∣dewed
him with her tears; and bidding him an eternal
adieu, delivered him, with many expressions of regret
and reluctance, into their custody<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Sir T. More, p. 491.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Glocester, being the nearest male of
the royal family capable of exercising the government,
seemed fully intitled, by the customs of the realm, to the
office of protector;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke of Glocester protector.</NOTE> and the council, not waiting for
Duke of the consent of parliament, installed him, without scruple,
in that high dignity<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Hist, Croyl. cont. p. 566.</NOTE>. The general prejudice entertain∣ed
by the nobility against the Queen and her kindred,
occasioned this precipitation and irregularity; and no one
foresaw any danger to the succession, much less to the
life of the infant princes, from a measure so obvious and
so natural. Besides that the duke had hitherto been able
to cover, by the most profound dissimulation, his fierce
and savage nature; the numerous issue of Edward, to∣gether
with the two children of Clarence, seemed to be
an eternal obstacle to his ambition; and it appeared
equally impracticable for him to dispatch so many persons
possessed of a preferable title, and imprudent to exclude
them. But a man, who had abandoned all principles
of honour and humanity, was soon carried by his pre∣dominant
passion beyond the reach of fear or precaution;
and Glocester, having so far succeeded in his views, no
longer hesitated in removing the farther obstructions
which lay between him and the crown. The death of
<PB N="286" REF="304"/>
the earl of Rivers, and of the other prisoners detained
in Pomfret was first determined; and he easily ob∣tained
the consent of the duke of Buckingham, as well
as of lord Hastings, to this violent and sanguinary
measure. However easy it was, in those illegal and
barbarous times, to procure a sentence against the most
innocent person, it appeared still more easy to dispatch
an enemy, without any trial or form, of process; and
orders were accordingly issued to Sir Richard Ratcliffe, a
proper instrument in the hands of this tyrant, to cut
off the heads of the noble prisoners. The protector then
assailed the fidelity of Buckingham by all the arguments
capable of swaying a vicious mind, which knew no mo∣tive
of action but interest and ambition. He represented,
that the murder of persons so nearly related to the King,
whom that prince professed so openly to love, and whose
injuries he so much resented, would never pass unpunished;
and all the actors in that scene were bound in prudence to
prevent the effects of his future vengeance; That it
would be impossible to keep the Queen forever at a
distance from her son, and equally impossible to prevent
her from instilling into his tender mind the thoughts of
retaliating, by like executions, the sanguinary insults
committed on her family: That the only method of ob∣viating
these mischiefs was by putting the sceptre into
the hands of a man, of whose friendship the duke might
be assured, and whose years and experience taught him
to pay resect to merit and to the rights of antient no∣bility:
And that the same necessity which had carried
them so far in resisting the usurpation of these intruders,
must justify them in attempting farther innovations, and
in makings by national consent, a new settlement of the
succession. To these reasons, he added the offers of great
private advantages to the duke of Buckingham, and he
<PB N="287" REF="305"/>
easily obtained from him a promise of supporting him in
all his enterprizes.</P>
<P>THE duke of Glocester, knowing the importance of
gaining lord Hastings, sounded at a distance his senti∣ments,
by the means of one Catesby, a lawyer, who was
a great confident of that nobleman; but found him im∣pregnable
in his allegiance and fidelity to the children of
Edward, who had ever honoured him with his friend∣ship<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Sir T. More, p. 493.</NOTE>.
He saw, therefore, that there was no longer any
measures to be kept with him; and he determined to ruin
utterly the man, whom he despaired of engaging to
concur in his usurpation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th June.</NOTE> On the very day when Rivers,
Gray, and Vaughan, were executed, or rather murdered,
at Pomfret, by Hastings's advice, the protector summoned
a council in the Tower; whither that nobleman, suspect∣ing
no design against him, repaired without hesitation.
The duke of Glocester was capable of committing the
most bloody and treacherous murders with the utmost
coolness and indifference. On taking his place at the
council-board, he appeared in the easiest and most jovial
humour in the world. He seemed to indulge himself in
familiar conversation with the counsellors, before they
should enter upon business; and having paid some com∣pliments
to Morton, bishop of Ely, on the good and
early strawberries which he railed in his garden at Hol∣born,
he begged the favour of having a dish of them,
which that prelate immediately dispatched a servant to
bring him. The protector then left the council, as if
called away by some other business; but soon after re∣turning
with an angry and enflamed countenance, he asked
them, what punishment those deserved that had plotted
against <HI>his</HI> life, who was so nearly related to the King,
and was entrusted with the administration of the govern∣ment?
<PB N="288" REF="306"/>
Hastings replied, that they merited the punish∣ment
of traitors. <HI>These traitors,</HI> cried the protector,
<HI>are the sorceress, my brother's wife, and Jane Shore, his
mistress, with others their associates: See to what a condi∣tion
they have reduced me by their incantations and witch∣craft:</HI>
Upon, which he laid bare his arm, all shrivelled
and decayed. But the counsellors, who knew that this
infirmity had attended him from his birth, looked at each
other in amazement; and above all, lord Hastings, who
as he had, since Edward's death, engaged in an intrigue
with Jane Shore<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Sir Thomas More, who has been followed, or rather transcribed, by all the historians of this short reign, says, that Jane Shore had fallen into connexions with lord Hastings; and this account agrees best with the course of the events: But in a proclamation of Richard's, to be found in Rymer, vol. xii. p. 204, the marquis of Dorset is reproached with these connexions. This reproach, however, might have been invented by Richard, or founded only on popular rumour; and is not suf∣ficient to overbalance the authority of Sir Thomas More. The procla∣mation is remarkable for the hypocritical purity of manners affected by Richard: This bloody and treacherous tyrant upbraids the marquis and others, with their gallantries and intrigues as the molt terrible enor∣mities.</NOTE>, was naturally anxious concerning
the issue of these extraordinary proceedings. <HI>Certainly
my lord,</HI> said he, <HI>if they be guilty of these crimes, they de∣serve
the severest punishment. And do you reply to me,</HI> ex∣claimed
the Protector, <HI>with your</HI> ifs <HI>and your</HI> ands? <HI>You
are the chief abettor of that witch Shore: You are yourself
a traitor: And I swear by St. Paul, that I will not dine be∣fore
your head be brought me.</HI> He struck the table with
his hand: Armed men rushed in at the signal: The
counsellors were thrown into the utmost consternation:
And one of the guards, as if by accident or mistake,
aimed a blow at lord Stanley, with a poll-ax, who, aware
of the danger, slunk below the table, and tho' he saved
his life, he received a severe wound on the head, in the
<PB N="289" REF="307"/>
protector's presence. Hastings was seized, was hurried
away, and instantly beheaded on a timber-log, which
lay in the court of the Tower<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hist. Croyl. cont. p. 566.</NOTE>. Two hours after, a
proclamation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution of lord Hastings.</NOTE> well penned and fairly wrote, was read
to the citizens or London, enumerating Hastings's of∣fences,
and apologizing to them, from the suddenness
of the discovery, for the sudden execution of that noble∣man,
who was very popular among them: But the say∣ing
of a merchant was much talked of on that occasion,
who remarked, that the proclamation was certainly
drawn by the spirit of prophecy<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Sir T. More, p. 496.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LORD Stanley, the archbishop of York, the bishop of
Ely, and other counsellors, were committed prisoners in
different chambers of the Tower: And the protector,
in order to carry on the farce of his accusations, ordered
the goods of Jane Shore to be seized; and he summoned
her to answer before the council for forcery and inchant∣ment.
But as no proofs, which could be received even
in that ignorant age, were produced against her, he or∣dered
her to be tried in the spiritual court, for her adul∣teries
and lewdness and she did penance in a white
sheet at St. Paul's before the whole people. This lady
was born of reputable parents in London, was well edu∣cated,
and married to a substantial citizen; but unhap∣pily,
views of interest, more than the maid's inclina∣tions,
had been consulted in this match, and her mind,
tho' framed for virtue, had proved unable to resist the
allurements of Edward, who solicited her favours. But
while seduced from her duty by this gay and amorous
monarch, she still made herself respectable by her other
virtues; and the ascendant, which her charms and viva∣city
long maintained over him, was all employed in, acts
<PB N="290" REF="308"/>
of beneficence and humanity. She was still forward to
oppose calumny, to protect the oppressed, to relieve the
indigent; and her good offices, the genuine result of her
heart, never waited the solicitation of presents, or the
hopes of reciprocal favours. But she lived not only to
feel the bitterness of shame imposed on her by this bar∣barous
tyrant, but to experience in old age and poverty,
the ingratitude of those courtiers, who had long solicited
her friendship, and been protected by her credit. No
one, among the great multitudes, whom she had oblig∣ed,
appeared to bring her consolation or relief: She
languished out her life in solitude and indigence: And
amidst a court, enured to the most atrocious crimes, the
frailties of this woman justified all violations of friend∣ship
towards her, and all oblivion of former favours.</P>
<P>THOSE acts of violence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The protector aims at the crown.</NOTE> exercised against all the near∣est
connexions of the late King, prognosticated the se∣verest
fate to his defenceless children; and after the mur∣der
of Hastings, the protector made no longer a secret
of his intentions to usurp the crown. The licentious life
of Edward, who was not restrained in his pleasures by
any principle either of honour or prudence, afforded a
pretence for declaring his marriage with the Queen in∣valid,
and all his posterity illegitimate. It was asserted,
that before his espousals with the lady Elizabeth Gray,
he had paid court to the lady Eleanor Talbot, daughter
of the earl of Shrewsbury; and being repulsed by the
virtue of that lady, he was obliged, ere he could gratify
his desires, to consent to a private marriage, without any
witnesses, by Stillington, bishop of Bath, who after∣wards
revealed the secret<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hist. Croyl. cont. p. 567. Comines. Sir Thomas More, p. 482.</NOTE>: It was also maintained, that
the act of attainder, passed against the duke of Clarence,
<PB N="291" REF="309"/>
had virtually incapacitated his children from succeed∣ing
to the crown; and these two families being set aside,
the protector of course remained the only true and le∣gitimate
heir of the house of York. But as it would be
difficult, if not impossible, to prove the preceding mar∣riage
of the late King; and as the principle which ex∣cluded
the heirs of an attainted blood, from private suc∣cessions
was never extended to the crown <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the protector
resolved to make use of another plea still more shameful
and scandalous. His partizans were taught to maintain,
that both Edward IV. and the duke of Clarence, were
illegitimate; that the dutchess of York had received
different lovers into her bed, who were the fathers of
these children; that their resemblance to those gallants
was a sufficient proof of their spurious, birth; and that
the duke of Glocester alone, of all her sons, appeared,
by his features and countenance, to be the lawful offspring
of the duke of York. Nothing can be imagined more
impudent than this assertion, which threw so foul an
imputation on his own mother, a princess of irreproach∣able
virtue, and then alive; yet the place chosen for first
promulgating it was the pulpit, before the whole people,
and in the protector's presence. Dr. Shaw was appointed
to preach in St. Paul's;<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d June.</NOTE> and having chosen this passage
for his text, <HI>Bastard slips shall not thrive,</HI> he enlarged on
all the topics, which could discredit the birth of Edward
IV. the duke of Clarence, and of all their children. He
then broke out in a panegyric on the duke of Glocester;
and exclaimed, “Behold this excellent prince, the ex∣press
image of his noble father, the genuine descend∣ant
of the house of York, bearing, no less in the vir∣tues
of his mind, than in the features of his coun∣tenance,
the character of the gallant Richard, once
your hero and favourite: He alone is entitled to your
allegiance: He must deliver you from the dominion of
<PB N="292" REF="310" MS="y"/>
all intruders: He alone can restore the lost glory and
honour of the nation.” It was previously contrived,
that, as the doctor should pronounce these words, the
duke of Glocester should enter the church; and it was
expected that the audience should cry out, <HI>God save
King Richard;</HI> which would immediately have been laid
hold of as a popular consent, and interpreted to be the
voice of the nation: But by a ridiculous mistake, worthy
of the whole scene, the duke did not appear, till after
this exclamation was already recited by the preacher.
The doctor was therefore obliged to repeat his rhetorical
figure out of its proper place: The audience, less from
the absurd conduct of the discourse, than from their de∣testation
of these proceedings, kept a profound silence;
and the protector and his preacher, were equally abashed
at the ill success of their stratagem.</P>
<P>BUT the duke was too far advanced to recede from his
criminal and ambitious projects. A new expedient was
tried to work on the people. The mayor, who was
brother to Dr. Shaw, and entirely in the protector's in∣terests,
called an assembly of the citizens; where the
duke of Buckingham, a man who possessed some talents
for eloquence, harangued them on the protector's title
to the throne, and displayed those numerous virtues, of
which, he pretended, that prince was possessed. He
next asked them, whether they would not have the
duke for King? and then stopt, in expectation of hear∣ing
the cry, <HI>God save King Richard.</HI> He was surprized
to observe them silent; and turning about to the mayor,
he asked him the reason. The mayor replied, that per∣haps
they did understand him. Buckingham then re∣peated
his discourse with some variation; inforced th
ame topics, asked the same question, and was received
with the same silence. “I now see the cause,” said
<PB N="293" REF="311"/>
the mayor, “the citizens are not accustomed to be ha∣rangued
by any but their recorder; and know not
how to answer a person of your grace's quality.” The
recorder, Fitz-Williams, was then commanded to repeat
the substance of the duke's speech; but the man, who
was very averse to the office, took care, throughout his
whole discourse, to have it understood, that he spoke
nothing of himself, and that he only conveyed to them
the sense of the duke of Buckingham. Still the audience
kept a profound silence: “This is wonderful obstinacy,”
cried the duke: “Express your meaning, my friends,
one way or other: When we apply to you on this occa∣sion,
it is merely from the regard which we bear to
you. The lords and commons have sufficient autho∣rity,
without your consent, to appoint a King: But I
require you here to declare in plain terms, whether or
not you will have the duke of Glocester for your so∣vereign.”
After all these efforts, some of the meanest
apprentices, incited by the protector's and Buckingham's
servants, raised a feeble cry, <HI>God save King Richard</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Sir Thomas More, p. 496.</NOTE>:
The sentiments of the nation, were now sufficiently de∣clared;
The voice of the people was the voice of God:
And Buckingham,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th June.</NOTE> with the mayor hastened to Bay∣nard's
castle, where the protector then resided, that they
might engage him to assume the government.</P>
<P>WHEN Richard was told, that a great multitude was
in the court, he refused to appear to them, and pretended
to be apprehensive for his persona<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l safety: A circumstance
much taken notice of by Buckingham, who observed to
the citizens, that the prince was ignorant of the whole
design. At last, he was persuaded to come forth, but he
still kept at some distance; and he asked the meaning of
their intrusion and importunity. Buckingham told him,
<PB N="294" REF="312"/>
that the nation were resolved to have him for King:
The protector declared his purpose to maintain his loyalty
to the present sovereign, and exhorted them to adhere to
the same resolution. He was told, that the nation were
determined to have another prince; and if he rejected
their unanimous voice, they must look out for one, who
would be more compliant.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pro∣tector as∣sumes the throne.</NOTE> This argument was too
powerful to be resisted: He was prevailed on to accept of
the crown: And he thenceforth acted is legitimate and
rightful sovereign.</P>
<P>THIS ridiculous farce was soon after followed by a
scene truly tragical: The murder of the two infant
princes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of Edward V. and of the duke of York.</NOTE> Richard sent orders to Sir Robert Brakenbury,
constable of the Tower, to put his nephews to death;
but this gentleman, who had sentiments of honour, re∣fused
to have any hand in the infamous office. The ty∣rant
then sent Sir James Tyrrel, who promised obedi∣ence;
and he ordered Brakenbury to resign to this gentle∣man
the keys of the Tower for one night, Tyrrel,
choosing three associates, Slater, Dighton and Forest,
came in the night-time to the door of the chamber
where the princes were lodged; and sending in the assas∣sins,
he bid them execute their commission; while he
himself said without. They found the young princes
in bed, and fallen into a sound sleep. After suffocating
them with the bolster and pillows, they showed their
naked bodies to Tyrrel, who ordered them to be buried
at the stair foot, deep in the ground, under a heap of
stones<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Sir T. More, p. 501.</NOTE>. These circumstances were all confessed by the
actors in the following reign; and they were never pu∣nished
for the crime: Probably, because Henry, whose
maxims of government were extremely arbitrary, desired
establish it as a principle, that the commands of the

reigning sovereign ought to justify every enormity in
those who paid obedience to them. But there is one cir∣cumstance
not so easy to be accounted for: It is pre∣tended,
that Richard, displeased with this indecent man∣ner
of burying his nephews, whom he had murdered,
gave his chaplain orders to dig up the bodies, and to in∣ter
them in consecrated ground; and as the man died soon
after, the place of their burial remained unknown, and
the bodies could never be found by any search, which
Henry VII. could make for them. Yet in the reign of
Charles II. when there was occasion to remove some
stones and to dig into the very spot, which was mention∣ed
as the place of their first interment, the bones of two
persons were there found, which by their size corre∣sponded
exactly to the age of Edward and his brother:
They were concluded with certainty to be the remains of
those princes, and were interred under a marble monu∣ment
by orders of King Charles<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 551.</NOTE>. Perhaps, Richard's
chaplain had died before he found an opportunity of execut∣ing
his master's commands; and the bodies being supposed
to be already removed, a diligent search was not made
for them by Henry in the place where they had been
interred.</P>

<HEAD>RICHARD III.</HEAD>
<P>THE first acts of Richard's administration were to
bestow rewards on those who had assisted him in
usurping the crown, and to gain by favours those, who,
he thought, were best able to support his future go∣vernment.
Thomas, lord Howard, was created duke
of Norfolk; Sir Thomas Howard, his son, earl of Sur∣rey;
lord Lovel, a viscount by the same name; even
lord Stanley was set at liberty and made lord steward of
the houshold. This nobleman had become obnoxious
by his first opposition to Richard's views, and also by
his marrying the countess dowager of Richmond, the
heiress of the Somerset family; but sensible of the ne∣cessity
of submission to the present government, he coun∣terfeited
such zeal for Richard's cause, that he was re∣ceived
into favour, and even found means to be entrusted
with the most important commands by that politic and
jealous tyrant.</P>
<P>BUT the person, who, both from the greatness of his
services, and the power and splendor of his family, was
best intitled to favours under the new government, was
the duke of Buckingham; and Richard seemed deter∣mined
to spare no pains nor bounty in securing him to
his interests. Buckingham was descended from a daugh∣ter
of Thomas of Woodstock, duke of Glocester, uncle
to Richard II. and by this pedigree, he was both allied
to the royal family, and had claims for dignities as well
as estates, of a very extensive nature. The duke of
Glocester, and Henry earl of Derby, afterwards Henry
IV. had married the two daughters and co-heirs of Bo∣hun,
earl of Hereford, one of the greatest of the an∣tient
barons, whose immense property came thus to be
<PB N="297" REF="315"/>
divided into two shares. The one was inherited by the
family of Buckingham; the other was united to the
crown by the family of Lancaster, and after the forfeit∣ure
of that royal line, was seized as legally devolved to
them, by the sovereigns of the house of York. The
duke of Buckingham laid hold of the present opportu∣nity,
and claimed the restitution of that portion of the
Hereford estate, which had escheated to the crown, as
well as of the great office of constable, which had long
continued by inheritance in his ancestors of that family.
Richard readily complied with these demands, which
were probably the price stipulated to Buckingham for
his assistance in promoting the usurpation. That noble∣man
was installed in the office of constable; he received
a grant of the estate of Hereford<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Dugdale's Baron. vol. i. p. 168, 169.</NOTE>; many other digni∣ties
and honours were conferred upon him; and the King
thought himself secure of preserving the fidelity of a man,
whose interests seemed to be so closely connected with
those of the present government.</P>
<P>BUT it was impossible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke of Buckingham dis∣contented.</NOTE> that friendship could long re∣main
inviolate between two men of such corrupt mo∣rals
as Richard and the duke of Buckingham. Histori∣ans
ascribe their first quarrel to the King's refusal of
making restitution of the Hereford estate; but it is cer∣tain
from records, that he passed a grant for that pur∣pose,
and that the full demands of Buckingham were sa∣tisfied
in this particular. Perhaps, Richard was soon
sensible of the danger which might ensue from conferring
such an immense property on a man of so turbulent a cha∣racter,
and afterwards raised difficulties about the execu∣tion
of his own grant: Perhaps he refused some other
demands of Buckingham, whom he found it impossible
to satisfy for his past, services: Perhaps, he resolved, ac∣cording
<PB N="298" REF="316"/>
to the usual maxim of politicians, to seize the
first opportunity of ruining this powerful subject, who
had been the principal instrument of his own elevation;
and the discovery of this intention begot the first suspi∣cions
in the duke of Buckingham. However this may
be, it is certain, that the duke, soon after Richard's acces∣sion,
began to form a conspiracy against the government,
and attempted to overthrow that usurpation, which he
himself had so zealously contributed to establish.</P>
<P>NEVER was there an usurpation in any country more
flagrant than that of Richard, nor more repugnant to every principle of justice and public interest. His claim was entirely founded on impudent allegations, never at∣tempted
to be proved, some of them incapable of proof,
and all of them, implying scandalous reflections on his
own family, and on the persons with whom he was the
most nearly connected. His title was never acknowledged
by any national assembly, scarce even by the lowest po∣pulace
to whom he appealed; and had become prevalent
merely for want of some person of distinction, who might
stand forth against him, and give a voice to those senti∣ments
of general detestation, which arose in every bo∣som.
Were men disposed to pardon these violations of
public right, the sense of private and domestic duty,
which is not to be effaced in the most barbarous times,
must have begot an abhorrence against him; and have
represented the murder of the young and innocent prin∣ces,
his nephews, with whose protection he had been
entrusted, in the most odious colours imaginable. To
endure such a bloody usurper seemed to draw disgrace
upon the nation, and to be attended with immediate dan∣ger
to every individual, who was distinguished by his
birth, merit, or services. Such was become the general
voice of the people; all parties were united in the same
<PB N="299" REF="317"/>
sentiments; and the Lancastrians, so long oppressed, and,
of late, so much discredited, felt their blasted hopes
again revive, and anxiously attended to the consequences
of these extraordinary events. The duke of Bucking∣ham,
whose family had been devoted to that interest,
and who, by his mother, a daughter of Edmund, duke
of Somerset, was allied to the house of Lancaster, was
easily inclined to espouse the cause of this party, and to
endeavour the restoring if to its antient superiority. Mor∣ton,
bishop of Ely, a zealous Lancastrian, whom the
King had imprisoned, and had afterwards committed to
the custody of Buckingham, encouraged these sentiments;
and by his exhortations the duke cast his eye on the
young earl of Richmond, as the only person, who could
free the nation from the tyranny of the present usurper<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Hist. Croyl. cont. p. 568.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY, earl of Richmond,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The earl of Richmond.</NOTE> was at this time detained
in a kind of honourable custody by the duke of Brittany;
and his descent, which seemed to give him some preten∣sions
to the crown, had been a great object of jealousy
both in the late and in the present reign. John, the
first duke of Somerset, who was grandson of John of
Gaunt, by a spurious branch, but legitimated by act of
parliament, had left only one daughter, Margaret; and
his younger brother, Edmund, had succeeded him in his
titles, and in a considerable part of his fortune. Mar∣garet
had espoused Edmund, earl of Richmond, half bro∣ther
of Henry VI. and son of Sir Owen Tudor and Ca∣therine
of France, relict of Henry V. and she bore him
only one son, who received the name of Henry, and who,
after his father's death, inherited the honours and fortune
of Richmond. His mother, being a widow, had espous∣ed
in second marriage Sir Henry Stafford, uncle to Buck∣ingham,
and after the death of that gentleman, had mar∣ried
<PB N="300" REF="318"/>
the present lord Stanley; but had no children by ei∣ther
of these husbands; and her son, Henry, was thus, in
the event of her death, the only lawful heir of all her
fortunes. But this was not the most considerable ad∣vantage,
which he had reason to expect from her suc∣cession:
He would represent the eldest branch of the
house of Somerset; he would inherit all the title of that
family to the crown; and tho' its claim, while any le∣gitimate
branch subsisted of the house of Lancaster, had
always been much disregarded, the zeal of faction, after
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> death of Henry VI. and the murder of prince Ed∣ward,
immediately conferred a weight and consideration
upon it.</P>
<P>KING Edward IV. finding, that all the Lancastrains
had cast their eyes towards the young earl of Rich∣mond,
as the object of their hopes, thought him also
worthy of his attention; and pursued him into his re∣treat
in Brittany, whither his uncle, the earl of Pem∣broke,
had carried him, after the battle of Teukesbury,
so fatal to his party. He applied to Francis II. duke of
Brittany, who was his ally, a weak but a good prince;
and desired him to deliver up this fugitive, who might be
the source of future disturbances in England: But the
duke, averse to so dishonourable a proposal, would only
consent, that, for the security of Edward, the young
nobleman should be detained in custody; and he received
an annual pension from England for the safe keeping or
subsistance of his prisoner. But towards the end of Ed∣ward's
reign, when the kingdom was menaced with a
war both from France and Scotland, the anxieties of the
English court with regard to Henry were very much en∣creased;
and Edward made a new proposal to the duke,
which covered, under the fairest appearances, the most
bloody and treacherous intentions. He pretended, that
<PB N="301" REF="319"/>
he was desirous of gaining his enemy, and of uniting
him to his own family by a marriage with his daughter,
Elizabeth; and he solicited to have him sent over to
England, for the executing a scheme, which would re∣dound
so much to his advantage. These pretences, se∣conded
by bri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es to Peter Landais, a corrupt minister,
by whom the duke was entirely governed, gained credit
with the court of Brittany: Henry was delivered into the
hands of the English agents: He was ready to embark:
When a suspicion of Edward's real design was suggested
to the duke, who recalled his orders, and thus saved the
unhappy youth from the imminent danger, which hung
over him.</P>
<P>THESE symptoms of continued jealousy in the reign∣ing
family of England both seemed to give some autho∣rity
to Henry's pretensions, and made him the object of
general favour and compassion, on account of the dan∣gers
and persecutions to which he was exposed. The
universal detestation of Richard's conduct turned still
more the attention of the nation towards him; and as all
the descendants of the house of York were either women
or minors, he seemed to be the only person from whom
the nation could expect the expulsion of the odious and
bloody tyrant. But notwithstanding these circumstanes,
which were so favourable to Henry, Buckingham and
the bishop of Ely well knew, that there would still lie
many obstacles in his way to the throne; and that tho'
the nation had been extremely divided between Henry
VI. and the duke of York, when present possession and
hereditary right stood in opposition to each other; yet, so
soon as these titles were conjoined by Edward IV. The
bulk of the people had come over to the reigning family;
and the Lancastrians had extremely decayed both in
numbers and authority. It was therefore suggested by
<PB N="302" REF="320"/>
Morton, and readily assented to by the duke, that the
only means of overturning the present usurpation, was
to unite the opposite factions, by contracting a marriage
between the earl of Richmond and the princess Elizabeth,
eldest daughter of King Edward, and thereby blending
together the opposite pretensions of their families, which
had so long been the source of public disorders and
convulsions. They were sensible, that the people were
extremely desirous of repose after so many bloody and
destructive commotions; that both Yorkists and Lan∣castrians,
who now lay equally under oppression, would
embrace this scheme with ardour; and that the prospect
of reconciling the two parties, which was in itself so de∣sirable
an end, would, when added to the general hatred
of the present government, render their cause absolutely
invincible. In consequence of these views, the prelate,
by means of Reginald Bray, steward to the countess of
Richmond, opened the first proposals of such an union
to that lady; and the scheme appeared so advantageous
for her son, and, at the same time, so likely to succeed,
that it admitted not of the least hesitation. Dr. Lewis,
a Welsh physician, who had access to the Queen-dowager
in her sanctuary, carried the proposals to her;
and found, that revenge for the murder of her brother
and of her three sons, apprehensions for her surviving
family, resentment of her confinement and oppressions,
easily overcame all her prejudices against: the house of
Lancaster, and procured her approbation of a marriage,
to which the age and birth, as well as the present situa∣tion,
of the two parties, seemed so naturally to invite
them. She secretly borrowed a sum of money in the
city, sent it over to the earl of Richmond, required his
oath to fulfil the marriage as soon as he should arrive in
England, advised him to levy as many foreign forces as
<PB N="303" REF="321"/>
possible, and promised to join him, on his first appear∣ance,
with all the friends and partizans of her family.</P>
<P>THE plan being thus laid upon the solid foundations
of good sense and found policy, it was secretly com∣municated
to the principal persons of both parties in all
the counties of England; and a wonderful alacrity ap∣peared
in every order of men, to forward its success and
completion. But it was impossible, that so extensive a
conspiracy could be conducted so secretly as entirely to
escape the jealous and vigilant eye of Richard; and he
soon received intelligence, that his enemies, headed by
the duke of Buckingham, were forming some design
against his authority. He immediately put himself in a
posture of defence by levying some troops in the North;
and he summoned the duke to appear at court, in such
terms as seemed to promise him a renewal of their for∣mer
friendship. But that nobleman, well acquainted
with the barbarity and treachery of Richards replied only
by taking arms in Wales, and giving the signal to his
accomplices for a general insurrecion in all parts of Eng∣land.
But there happened at that very time to fall such
heavy rains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">October.</NOTE> so incessant and continued, as exceeded any
known in the memory of man; and the Severne, with
the other rivers in that neighbourhood, swelled to a
height which rendered them impassable, and prevented
Buckingham from marching into the heart of England
to join his associates. The Welshmen, partly moved
by superstition at this extraordinary event, partly distressed
by famine in their camp, fell off from him; and Buck∣ingham
finding himself deserted by his followers, put
on a disguise, and took shelter in the house of Banister,
an old servant of his family. But being detected in his
retreat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bucking∣ham exe∣cuted.</NOTE> he was brought to the King at Salisbury; and
was instantly tried, condemned, and executed, according
<PB N="304" REF="322" MS="y"/>
to the summary method practised in those ages<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Hist. Croyl. cont. p. 568.</NOTE>. The
other conspirators, who took arms in four different
places, at Exeter, at Salisbury, at Newbury, at Maid∣stone,
hearing of the duke of Buckingham's misfortunes,
despaired of success, and immediately dispersed them∣selves.</P>
<P>THE marquis of Dorset and bishop of Ely made their
escape beyond sea: Many others were equally fortunate.
Several fell into Richard's hands, of whom he made
some examples. His executions seem not to have been
remarkably severe; tho' we are told of one gentleman,
William Colingbourne, who suffered under colour of this
rebellion, but in reality for a distich of quibbling verses,
which he had composed against Richard and his mini∣sters<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>The lines were:
<Q><L>The Rat, the Cat, and Lovel that Dog,</L>
<L>Rule all England under the Hog.</L></Q>
Alluding to the names of Ratcliffe and Catesby; and to Richard's arms, which were a boar.</P></NOTE>.
The earl of Richmond, in concert with his
friends, had set fail from St. Malo's, carrying on board
a body of 5000 men, levied in foreign parts; but his
fleet being at first drove back by a storm, he appeared not
on the coast of England till after the dispersion of all his
friends; and he found himself obliged <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> return to the
court of Brittany.</P>
<P>THE King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1484.</NOTE> thus triumphant in all places, and
strengthened by this unsuccessful attempt to dethrone
him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d of Jan.</NOTE> ventured at last to summon a parliament; a mea∣sure
which his crimes and flagrant usurpation had made
him hitherto decline. Tho' it was natural that the par∣liament,
in a contest of national parties, should always
<PB N="305" REF="323"/>
adhere to the victor, he seems to have apprehended, lest
his title, founded on no principle, and supported by no
party, might be rejected by that assembly. But his
enemies being now at his feet, the parliament had no
choice but to recognize his authority, and acknowledge
his right to the crown. His only son Edward, then a
youth of twelve years of age, was created prince of
Wales: The duties of tonnage and poundage were
granted him for life: And Richard, in order to recon∣cile
the nation to his government, passed some popular
laws, particularly one against the late practice of extort∣ing
money on pretence of benevolences.</P>
<P>ALL the other measures of the King tended to the
same object. Sensible, that the only circumstance which
could give him security was to gain the confidence of
the Yorkists, he paid court to the Queen-dowager with
such art and address, made such earnest protestations of
his sincere good-will and friendship, that this princess,
tired of confinement, and despairing of any success from
her former projects, ventured to leave her sanctuary, and
to put herself and her daughters into the hands of the
tyrant. But he soon carried farther his views for the
establishment of his throne. He had married Anne, the
second daughter of the earl of Warwic, and widow of
Edward prince of Wales, whom Richard himself had
murdered; but this princess having born him but one
son, who died about this time, he considered her as an
invincible obstacle to the settlement of his fortune, and
be was believed to have carried her off by poison; a
crime for which the public could not be supposed to have
any very solid proof, but which the usual tenor of his
conduct made it reasonable to suspect. He now thought
it in his power to remove the chief perils which threaten∣ed
his government. The earl of Richmond, he knew
<PB N="306" REF="324"/>
could never be dangerous but from his projected mar∣riage
with the princess Elizabeth, the true heir of the
crown; and he therefore intended, by means of a papal
dispensation, to espouse himself this princess, and thus to
unite in his own family their contending titles. The
Queen-dowager, eager to recover her lost authority,
neither scrupled this alliance, which was very unusual
in England, and was regarded as incestuous; nor felt
any horror at marrying her daughter to the murderer of
her three sons and of her brother: She even conjoined
so far her interests with those of the u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urper, that she
wrote to all her partizans, and among the rest to her son
the marquis of Dorset, desiring them to withdraw from
the earl of Richmond; an injury which, the earl could
never afterwards forgive: The court of Rome was ap∣plied
to for a dispensation: Richard thought, that he
could easily defend himself during the interval, till it
arrived; and he had afterwards the agreeable prospect
of a full and secure settlement. He flattered himself,
that the English nation, seeing all danger removed of
a disputed succession, would then acquiesce under the
dominion of a prince, who was of mature years, of great
abilities, and of a genius qualified for government; and
that they would forgive him all the crimes which he had
committed in paving his way to the throne.</P>
<P>BUT the crimes of Richard were so horrid and so
shocking to humanity, that the natural sentiments of
men, without any political or public views, were suffi∣cient
to render his government unstable; and every per∣son
of probity and honour was earnest to prevent the
sceptre from being farther polluted by that bloody and
treacherous hand which held it. All the exiles flocked
to the earl of Richmond in Brittany, and exhorted him
to hasten his attempt of a new invasion, and to prevent
<PB N="307" REF="325"/>
the marriage of the princess Elizabeth, which must prove
so fatal to all his hopes. The earl, sensible of the urgent
necessity, but dreading the treachery of Peter Landais,
who had entered into a negotiation with Richard for
delivering him up, was obliged to attend only to his
present safety; and he made his escape to the court of
France. The ministers of Charles VIII. who had now
succeeded to the throne after the death of his father
Lewis, gave him countenance and protection; and being
desirous of raising disturbances to Richard, they secretly
encouraged the earl in the levies which he made for the
support of his enterprize against England. The earl of
Oxford, whom Richard's suspicions had thrown into
confinement, having made his escape, here joined Henry;
and enflamed his ardour for the attempt, by the favour∣able
accounts which he brought of the dispositions of the
English nations, and their universal hatred of Richard's
crimes and usurpation.</P>
<P>THE earl of Richmond set out from Harfleur in Nor∣mandy<NOTE PLACE="marg">1485.</NOTE>
with a retinue of about 2000 persons;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasion by the earl of Richmond. 7th of Au∣gust.</NOTE> and after a
navigation of six days, he arrived at Milford-Haven in
Wales, where he landed without opposition. He di∣rected
his course to that part of the kingdom, in hopes
that the Welsh, who regarded him as their countryman,
and who had been already prepossessed in favour of his
cause by means of the duke of Buckingham, would join
his standard, and enable him to make <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead against the
established government. Richard, who knew not in
what quarter he might expect the invader, had taken
post at Nottingham, in the centre of the kingdom; and
having given commissions to different persons in the seve∣ral
counties, whom he empowered to oppose his enemy,
he proposed in person to fly, on the first alarm, to the
<PB N="308" REF="326"/>
place which was exposed to danger. Sir Rice ap
Thomas and Sir Walter Herbert were entrusted with
this authority in Wales; but the former immediately de∣serted
to Henry; the second made but feeble opposition
to him: And the earl, advancing towards Shrewsbury,
received every day some reinforcement from his partizans.
Sir Gilbert Talbot joined him with all the vassals and
retainers of the family of Shrewsbury; Sir Thomas
Bourchier, Sir Walter Hungerford, brought their friends
to share his fortune; and the appearance of men of di∣stinction
in his camp made already his cause wear a fa∣vourable
aspect.</P>
<P>BUT the danger to which Richard was chiefly exposed,
proceeded not so much from the zeal of his open enemies,
as from the infidelity of his pretended friends. Scarce
any nobleman of distinction was sincerely attached to his
cause, except the duke of Norfolk; and all those who
feigned the most loyalty were only watching an oppor∣tunity
to betray and desert him. But the persons of
whom he entertained the greatest suspicion, were the
lords Stanley and his brother Sir William; whose con∣nexions
with the earl of Richmond, notwithstanding
their professions of attachment to his person, were never
entirely forgot or overlooked by him. When he em∣powered
lord Stanley to levy forces, he still retained his
eldest son, lord Strange, as a pledge of his fidelity; and
that nobleman was, on this account, obliged to employ
great precaut<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and reserve in his proceedings. He
raised a powerful body of his friends and retainers in
Cheshire and Lancashire, but without openly declaring
himself: And tho' Henry had received secret assurances
of his friendly intention, the armies on both sides knew
not what to infer from, his equivocal behaviour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d Aug. Battle of Bosworth.</NOTE> The
two rivals, at last, approached each other, at Bosworth
near Leicester; Henry at the head of six thousand men,
<PB N="309" REF="327"/>
Richard with an army of above double the number;
and a decisive action was every hour looked for between
them. Stanley, who commanded about seven thousand
men, took care to post himself at Atherstone, not far
from the expected field of battle; and he made such a
disposition as enabled him on occasion to join either
party. Richard had too much sagacity not to discover
his intentions from these movements; but he kept the
secret from his own men for fear of discouraging them:
He took not immediate revenge on Stanley's son, as
some of his courtiers advised him; because he hoped that
so valuable a pledge would induce the father to prolong
still farther his ambiguous conduct: And he hastened to
decide by arms the quarrel with his competitor; being
certain, that a victory over the earl of Richmond
would enable him to take ample revenge of all his ene∣mies,
open and concealed.</P>
<P>THE van of Richmond's army, consisting of archers,
was commanded by John earl of Oxford: Sir Gilbert
Talbot led the right wing; Sir John Savage the left:
The earl himself, accompanied by his uncle, the earl
of Pembroke, placed himself in the main body. Richard
also took post in <HI>his</HI> main body, and entrusted the com∣mand
of his van to the duke of Norfolk: As his wings
were never engaged, we have not learned the names of
the several commanders. Soon after the battle began,
lord Stanley, whose conduct in this whole affair discovers
great precaution and abilities, appeared in the field, and
declared for the earl of Richmond. This measure, which
was so unexpected to the men, tho' not to their leaders,
had a proportional effect on both armies: It inspired un∣usual
courage into Henry's soldiers; it threw Richard's
into dismay and confusion. The intrepid tyrant, sensible
of his desperate situation, cast his eye around the field,
and perceiving his rival at no great distance, he drove
<PB N="310" REF="328"/>
against him with fury, in hopes, that either Henry's
death or his own would soon decide the victory between
them. He killed with his own hands Sir William
Brandon, standard-bearer to the earl: He dismounted
Sir John Cheyney: He was now within reach of Rich∣mond
himself, who declined not the combat; when Sir
William Stanley, breaking in with his troops, sur∣rounded
Richard, who, fighting bravely to the last mo∣ment,
was overwhelmed by the numbers of his ene∣mies,
and perished by a fate too mild and honourable<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death</NOTE>
for his multiplied and detestable enormities. His men
every where sought for safety by flight.</P>
<P>THERE fell in this battle about 4000 men on the side
of the vanquished; and among these the duke of Nor∣folk,
the lord Ferrars of Chartley, Sir Richard Rat∣cliffe,
Sir Robert Piercy, and Sir Robert Brakenbury.
The loss was very inconsiderable on the side of the vic∣tors.
Sir William Catesby, a great instrument of Ri∣chard's
crimes, was taken, and soon after beheaded, with
some others, at Leicester, The body of Richard was
found in the field, covered with dead enemies, and all
besmeared with blood: It was thrown carelessly across
a horse; was carried to Leicester amid the shouts of the
insulting spectators; and was interred in the Gray-Friars
church of that place.</P>
<P>THE historians who favour Richard (for even he has<NOTE PLACE="marg">and charac∣ter of Rich∣ard III.</NOTE>
met with partizans among the later writers) maintain,
that he was well qualified for government, had he legally
obtained it; and that he committed no crimes but such as
were necessary to procure him possession of the crown:
But this is a very poor apology, when it is confessed, that
he was ready to commit the most horrid crimes, which
appeared necessary for that purpose; and it is certain,
that all his courage and capacity, qualities in which he

<P>THUS have we pursued the History of England thro'
a series of many barbarous ages; till we have at last
reached the dawnings of civility and science, and have
the prospect, both of greater certainty in our historical
narrations, and of being able to present to the reader
a spectacle more worthy of his attention. The want
of certainty, however, and of circumstances, is not alike
to be complained of throughout every period of this long
narration. This island possesses many antient historians
of good credit, as well as many historical monuments;
and it is rare, that the annals of so uncultivated a people,
as were the English as well as the other European na∣tions,
after the decline of Roman learning, have been
transmitted to posterity so compleat, and with so little
mixture of falsehood and of fable. This advantage we
owe entirely to the clergy of the church of Rome; who,
founding their authority on their superior knowledge,
preserved the precious literature of antiquity from a total
extinction<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Every one that has perused the ancient Monkish writers, knows, that, however barbarous their own style, they are full of allusions to the Latin classics, especially the poets. There seems also in those middle ages to have remained many antient books, that are now lost. Malmesbury, who flourished in the reign of Henry I. and King Stephen, quotes Livy's description of Caesar's passage over the Rubicon Fitz-Stephen, who lived in the reign of Henry II. alludes to a passage in the lar∣ger history of Sallust. In the collection of letters, which passes under the name of Thomas a Becket, we see how familiar all the antient history and ancient books were to the more ingenious and more dignified churchmen of that time, and consequently how much that order of men must have surpassed all the other members of the society. That prelate and his friends call each other philosophers in all the course of their correspondence, and consider the rest of the world as sunk into total ignorance and barbarism.</NOTE>; and under shelter of their numerous privi∣leges
<PB N="312" REF="330"/>
and immunities, acquired a security by means of
the superstition, which they would in vain have claimed,
from the justice and humanity, of those turbulent and
licentious ages. Nor is the spectacle altogether unen∣tertaining
and uninstructive, which the history of those
times presents to us. The view of human manners and
actions, in all their variety of appearances, is both pro∣fitable
and agreeable; and if the aspect in some periods
seems horrid and deformed, we may thence learn to
cherish with the greater anxiety that science and civi∣lity
which has so close a connexion with virtue and hu∣manity,
and which, as it is a sovereign antidote against
superstition, is also the most effectual remedy against
vice and disorders of every kind.</P>
<P>THE rise, progress, perfection, and decline of art and
science, are curious objects of contemplation, and in∣timately
connected with a narration of civil transactions.
The events of no particular period can be fully accounted
for, but by considering the degrees of advancement,
which men have reached in those particulars.</P>
<P>THOSE who cast their eye on the general revolutions
of society, will find, that, as all the improvements of the
human mind had reached nearly to their state of perfec∣tion
about the age of Augustus, there was a sensible de∣cline
from that point or period; and men thenceforth
relapsed gradually into ignorance and barbarism. The
<PB N="313" REF="331"/>
unlimited extent of the Roman empire, and the conse∣quent
despotism of the monarchs, extinguished all emu∣lation,
debased the generous spirits of men, and de∣pressed
that noble flame, by which all the refined arts
must be cherished and enlivened. The military govern∣ment,
which soon succeeded, rendered even the lives and
properties of men insecure and precarious; and proved
destructive to those vulgar and more necessary arts of
agriculture, manufactures, and commerce; and in the
end, to the military art and genius itself, by which
alone the immense fabric of the empire could be sup∣ported.
The irruption of the barbarous nations, which
soon followed, overwhelmed all human knowledge,
which was already far in its decline; and men sunk
every age deeper into ignorance, stupidity, and super∣stition;
till the light of antient science and history, had
very nearly suffered a total extinction in all the Euro∣pean
nations.</P>
<P>BUT there is an ultimate point of depression, as well as
of exaltation, from which human affairs naturally return
in a contrary progress, and beyond which they seldom
pass either in their advancement or decline. The pe∣riod,
in which the people of Christendom were the low∣est
sunk in ignorance, and consequently in disorders of
every kind, may justly be fixed at the eleventh century,
about the age of William the Conqueror; and from
that aera, the sun of science, beginning to re-ascend,
threw out many gleams of light, which preceded the full
morning, when letters were revived in the fifteenth cen∣tury.
The Danes and other northern people who had
so long infested all the coasts, and even the inland parts
of Europe, by their depredations, having now learned
the arts of tillage and agriculture, found a settled sub∣sistence
at home, and were no longer tempted to desert
<PB N="314" REF="332"/>
their industry, in order to seek a precarious livelihood
by rapine and by the plunder of their neighbours. The
feudal governments also, among the more southern na∣tions,
were reduced to a kind of system; and tho' that
strange species of civil polity was ill fitted to ensure ei∣ther
liberty or tranquillity, it was preferable to the uni∣versal
licence and disorder, which had every where pre∣ceded
it. But perhaps there was no event, which tended
farther to the improvement of the age, than one, which
has not been much remarked, the accidental finding a
copy of Justinian's Pandects, about the year 1130, in
the town of Amalfi in Italy.</P>
<P>THE ecclesiastics, who had leisure, and some incli∣nation
to study, immediately adopted with zeal this ex∣cellent
system of jurisprudence, and spread the knowledge
of it in every part of Europe. Besides the intrinsic merit
of the performance, it was recommended to them by its
original connexion with the imperial city of Rome,
which, being the seat of their religion seemed to ac∣quire
a new lustre and authority, by the diffusion
of its laws over the western world. In less than
ten years after the discovery of the Pandects, Va∣carius,
under the protection of Theobald, archbishop
of Canterbury, read public lectures of civil law in the
university of Oxford; and the clergy every where, by
their example as well as exhortation, were the means
of spreading the highest esteem for this new science.
That order of men, having large possessions to defend,
were in a manner necessitated to turn their studies to∣wards
the law; and their properties being often endan∣gered
by the violence of the princes and barons, it be∣came
their interest to enforce the observance of general
and equitable rules, from which alone they could re∣ceive
protection. As they possessed all the knowledge
<PB N="315" REF="333"/>
of the age, and were alone acquainted with the habits
of thinking, the practice as well as science of the law,
fell mostly into their hands: And tho' the close connex∣ion,
which without any necessity they formed between
the canon and civil law, begot a jealousy in the laity of
England, and prevented the Roman jurisprudence from
becoming the municipal law of the country, as was the
case in many states of Europe, a great part of it was
secretly transferred into the practice of the courts of ju∣stice,
and the imitation of their neighbours, made the
English gradually endeavour to raise their own law from
its original state of rudeness and imperfection.</P>
<P>IT is easy to see what advantages Europe must have
reaped by its inheriting at once from the antients, so
complete an art, which was of itself so necessary for
giving security to all other arts, and which, by refining,
and still more, by bestowing solidity on the judgment,
served as a model to further improvements. The sen∣sible
utility of the Roman law both to public and pri∣vate
interest recommended the study of it, at a time
when the more exalted and speculative sciences carried
no charms with them; and thus the last branch of antient
literature, which remained uncorrupted, was happily the
first transmitted to the modern world. For it is remark∣able,
that in the decline of Roman learning, when the
philosophers were universally infected with superstition
and sophistry, and the poets and histrorians with barba∣rism,
the lawyers, who in other countries are seldom
models of science or politeness, were yet able, by the
constant study and close imitation of their predecessors,
to maintain the same good sense in their decisions and
reasonings, and the same purity in their language and
expression.</P>
<P>WHAT bestowed an additional merit on the civil law,
was the extreme ignorance and imperfection of that ju∣risprudence,
<PB N="316" REF="334"/>
which preceded it among all the European
nations, especially among the Saxons or antient Eng∣lish.
What absurdities prevailed at that time in the
administration of justice, may be conceived from the au∣thentic
monuments which remain of the antient Saxon
laws; where a pecuniary commutation was received for
every crime, where stated prices were fixed for men's
lives and members, where private revenges were autho∣rized
for all injuries, where the use of the ordeal, cors∣net,
and afterwards of the duel, was the received me∣thod
of proof, and where the judges were rustic free∣holders,
assembled of a sudden, and deciding a cause
from one debate or altercation of the parties. Such a
state of society was very little advanced beyond the rude
state of nature: Violence universally prevailed, instead
of general and equitable maxims: The pretended liberty
of the times, was only an incapacity of submitting to
government; And men, not protected by law in their
lives and properties, sought shelter, by their personal
servility and attachments, under some powerful chieftain,
or by voluntary combinations.</P>
<P>THE gradual progress of improvement, raised the Eu∣ropeans
somewhat from this uncultivated state; and af∣fairs,
in this island particularly, took very early a turn,
which was more favourable to justice and to liberty.
Civil employments and occupations soon became honour∣able
among the English: The situation of that people
rendered not the perpetual attention to wars so necessary
as among their neighbours, and all regard was not con∣fined
to the military profession: The gentry, and even
the nobility, began to deem an acquaintance with the
law, a requisite part of education: They were less di∣verted
than afterwards from studies of this kind by other
sciences; and in the age of Henry VI. we are told by
<PB N="317" REF="335"/>
Fortescue, there were in the Inns of Court about two
thousand students, most of them men of honourable
birth, who gave application to this branch of civil know∣ledge.
A circumstance which proves, that a considerable
advance was already made in the science of government,
and which prognosticated still a greater.</P>
<P>ONE chief advantage, which resulted from the intro∣duction
and progress of the arts, was the introduction
and progress of freedom; and this consequence affected
men both in their <HI>personal</HI> and <HI>civil</HI> capacities.</P>
<P>IF we consider the antient state of Europe, we shall
find, that the far greater part of the society were every
where bereaved of their <HI>personal</HI> liberty, and lived en∣tirely
at the will of their masters. Every one, that
was not noble, was a slave: The peasants were fold along
with the land: The few inhabitants of cities were not
in a better condition: Even the gentry themselves were
subjected to a long; train of subordination under the
greater barons or chief vassals of the crown; who, tho'
seemingly placed in a high state of splendor, yet, having
but a slender protection from the law, were exposed to
every tempest of state, and by the precarious con∣dition,
in which they lived, paid dearly for the power
of oppressing and tyrannizing over their inferiors. The
first incident, which broke in upon this violent system
of government, was the practice, begun in France, of
erecting communities and corporations, endowed with
privileges and a separate municipal government, which
gave them protection against the tyranny of the barons,
and which the prince himself deemed it prudent to re∣spect<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">There appear early symptoms of the jealousy, entertained by the barons against the progress of the arts, as destructive of their licentious power. A law was enacted, 7 Henry IV. cap. 17. prohibiting any one who did not possess twenty shillings a-year in land from binding his sons apprentices to any trade. They found already that the cities began to drain the country of the labourers and husbandmen; and did not foresee how much the encrease of commerce would increase the value of their estates. See farther, Cotton, p. 170. The Kings, to encourage the boroughs, granted them this privilege, that any villain, who had lived a twelvemonth in any corporation and had been of the gild, should be thenceforth regarded as free.</NOTE>.
The relaxation of the feudal tenures, and an
<PB N="318" REF="336"/>
execution, somewhat stricter, of the public law, bestow∣ed
an independence on vassals, which was unknown to
their forefathers. And even the peasants themselves,
tho' later than other orders of the state, made their escape
from those bonds of villenage or slavery, in which they
had formerly been retained.</P>
<P>IT may appear strange, that the progress of the arts,
which seems among the Greeks and Romans, to have
daily encreased the number of slaves, should, in later
times, have proved so general a source of liberty; but
this difference of the events proceeded from a great dif∣ference
in the circumstances, which attended those in∣stitutions.
The antient barons, being obliged to main∣tain
themselves continually in a military posture, and
little emulous of elegance or splendor, employed not
their villains as domestic servants, much less as manu∣facturers,
but composed their retinue of free-men, whose
military spirit; rendered the chieftain formidable to his
neighbours, and, who were ready to attend him in every
warlike enterprize. The villains were occupied entirely
in the cultivation of their master's land, and paid their
rents either in corn and cattle and other produce of the
farm, or in servile offices, which they performed about
the baron's family, and upon the farms which he retained
in his own possession. In proportion as agriculture im∣proved,
and money encreased, it was found, that these
<PB N="319" REF="337"/>
services, tho' extremely burthensome to the villain, were
of little advantage to the master; and that the produce
of a large estate could be much more conveniently dis∣posed
of by the peasant himself, who raised it, than by
the landlord or his bailiff, who were formerly accustomed
to receive it. A commutation was therefore made of
rents for services, and of money-rents for those in kind;
and as men, in a subsequent age, discovered, that farms
were better cultivated where the farmer enjoyed a secu∣rity
of possession, the practice of granting leases to the
peasant began to prevail, which entirely broke the bonds
of servitude, already much relaxed from the former prac∣tices.
After this manner, villenage went gradually into
difuse throughout the more civilized parts of Europe: The
interest of the master, as well as that of the slave, con∣curred
in this alteration. The latest laws which we
find in England for the enforcing or regulating this spe∣cies
of servitude, were enacted in the reign of Henry VII.
And tho' the antient statutes on this subject remain still
unrepealed by parliament, it appears, that, before the
reign of Elizabeth, the distinction of villain and freeman
was totally, tho' insensibly abolished, and that no person
remained in the state, to whom the former laws could be
applied.</P>
<P>THUS <HI>personal</HI> freedom became almost general in Eu∣rope;
an advantage which paved the way for the en∣crease
of <HI>political</HI> or <HI>civil</HI> liberty, and which, even where
it was not attended with this salutary effect, served to
give the members of the community some of the most
considerable advantages of it.</P>
<P>THE constitution of the English government, ever
since the invasion of this island by the Saxons, may
boast of this pre-eminence, that in no age the will of
the monarch was ever entirely absolute and uncontrouled:
<PB N="320" REF="338"/>
But in other respects the balance of power has extremely
shifted among the several orders of the state; and this fa∣bric
has experienced the same mutability, which has at∣tended
all human institutions.</P>
<P>THE antient Saxons, like the other German nations,
where each individual was enured to arms, and where
the independance of men was secured by a great equa∣lity
of possessions, seem to have admitted a considerable
mixture of democracy into their form of government,
and to have been one of the freest nations, of which
there remains any account in the records of history. Af∣ter
this tribe was settled in England, especially after the
dissolution pf the Heptarchy, the great extent of the
kingdom produced a great inequality in property; and
the balance seems to have inclined to the side of the
aristocracy. The Norman conquest threw more autho∣rity
into the hands of the sovereign, which, however, ad∣mitted
of great controul; tho' derived less from the general
forms of the constitution, which were inaccurate and
irregular, than from the independant power enjoyed by
each baron in his particular district or province. The
establishment of the great charter exalted still higher the
Aristocracy, imposed regular limits on royal power, and
gradually introduced some mixture of Democracy into
the constitution. But even during this period, from the
accession of Edward I. to the death of Richard III. the
condition of the commons was nowise desirable; a kind
of Polish Aristocracy prevailed; and tho' the King<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
were limited, the people were as yet far from being free.
It required the authority almost absolute of the sove∣reigns,
which, took place in the subsequent period, to
pull down these disorderly and licentious tyrants, who
were equal enemies to peace and to freedom, and to
establish that regular execution of the laws, which, in a
<PB N="321" REF="339"/>
following age, enabled the people to erect a regular and
equitable plan of liberty.</P>
<P>IN each of these successive alterations, the only rule
of government, which is intelligible or carries any au∣thority
with it, is the established practice of the age,
and the maxims of administration, which are at that time
prevalent, and universally assented to. Those who,
from a pretended respect to antiquity, appeal at every
turn to an original plan of the constitution, only cover
their turbulent spirit and their private ambition under the
appearance of venerable forms; and whatever period
they pitch on for their model, they may still be carried
back to a more antient period, where they will find the
measures of power entirely different, and where every
circumstance, by reason of the greater barbarity of the
times, will appear still less worthy of imitation. Above
all, a civilized nation, like the English, who have hap∣pily
established the most perfect and most accurate system
of liberty, that ever was found compatible with govern∣ment,
ought to be cautious of appealing to the practice
of their ancestors, or regarding the maxims of unculti∣vated
ages as certain rules for their present conduct. An
acquaintance with the history of the antient, periods of
their government is chiefly <HI>useful</HI> by instructing them to
cherish their present constitution from a comparison or
contrast with the condition of those distant times. And
it is also <HI>curious,</HI> by shewing them the remote, and com∣monly
faint and disfigured originals of the most finish∣ed
and most noble institutions, and by instructing them
in the great mixture of accident which commonly con∣curs
with a small ingredient of wisdom and forefight, in
erecting the complicated fabric of the most perfect go∣vernment.</P>

<P>THE victory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXIV.</NOTE> which the earl of Richmond gained
at Bosworth over Richard the third, was entirely
decisive; being attended, as well with the total rout and
dispersion of the royal army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">August 22.</NOTE> as with the death of the
King himself. The joy of so great success suddenly
prompted the soldiers, in the field of battle, to bestow on
their victorious general the appellation of King, which
he had not hitherto assumed; and the acclamations of
<HI>Long live Henry thg seventh,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Accession of Henry VII.</NOTE> by a natural and unpremedi∣tated
movement, resounded from all quarters. To be∣stow
some appearance of formality on this species of mi∣litary
election, Sir William Stanley brought a crown of
ornament, which Richard wore in battle, and which
had been found among the spoils; and he put it on the
head of the conqueror. Henry himself remained not in
suspense; but immediately, without hesttation, accepted
<PB N="323" REF="341"/>
of the magnificent present, which was tendered him.
He was come to the great crisis of his fortune; and being
Obliged suddenly to determine himself, amidst great dif∣ficulties,
which he must have frequently revolved in his
mind, he chose that part, which his ambition suggested
to him, and to which he seemed to be conducted by his
present prosperous success.</P>
<P>THERE were many titles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His title to the crown.</NOTE> on which Henry could
found his right to the throne; but no one of them free
from grent objections, if considered, either with respect
to justice or to policy.</P>
<P>DURING some years, Henry had been regarded as heir
to the house of Lancaster, by the party attached to that
family; but the title of the house of Lancaster itself to
the crown was generally thought to be very ill founded.
Henry the fourth, who had first raised that family to
royal dignity, had never clearly determined the founda∣tion
of his claim; and while he plainly invaded the or∣der
of succession, he had not acknowledged the election
of the people. The parliament had indeed often re∣cognized
the title of the Lancastrian princes; but these
votes had little authority, being considered as instances
of prudent complaisance towards a family in possession of
present power: And they had accordingly been often
reversed during the late prevalence of the house of
York. Prudent men also, who had been willing, for the
sake of peace, to submit to any established authority,
desired not to see the claims of a family revived, which
must produce many convulsions at present, and which
dis∣jointed
for the future the whole system of hereditary
right. Besides; allowing the title of the house of Lan∣caster
to be legal, Henry himself was not the true heir
of that family; and nothing but the obstinacy, natural
to a faction, which never, without the utmost reluctance,
<PB N="324" REF="342"/>
will submit to their antagonists, could have engaged the
partizans of that house to adopt the earl of Richmond
us their head. His mother indeed, Margaret, countess
of Richmond, was sole daughter and heir of the house
of Somerset, descended from John of Gaunt duke of
Lancaster: But the birth of the first of the Somerset line
was itself illegitimate and even adulterous. And tho'
the duke of Lancaster had obtained the legitimation of
his natural children by a patent from Richard the second,
confirmed in parliament; it might justly be doubted,
whether this deed could bestow any title to the crown;
since in the patent itself all the privileges conferred by
it are fully enumerated, and the succession to the king∣dom
is expresly excluded<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. vii. p. 849. Coke's Inst. 4 Inst. part 1. p. 37.</NOTE>. In all the settlements of the
crown, made during the reigns of the Lancastrian princes,
the line of Somerset had been entirely overlooked; and
it was not till the failure of the legitimate branch, that
men had paid any attention to their claim. And to add
to the general dissatisfaction against Henry's title, his
mother, from whom he derived all his right, was still
alive; and evidently preceded him in the order of suc∣cesson.</P>
<P>THE title of the house of York, both from the plain
reason of the case, and from the late popular govern∣ment
of Edward the fourth, had obtained universally
the preference in the sentiments of the people; and
Henry might engraft his claim on the right of that fa∣mily,
by his intended marriage with the princess Eli∣zabeth,
the heiress of it; a marriage, which he had so∣lemnly
promised to celebrate, and to the expectation of
which he had chiefly owed all his past successes. But
many reasons dissuaded Henry from adopting this expe∣dient.
<PB N="325" REF="343"/>
Were he to receive the crown only in right of
his spouse, his power, he knew, would be very limited;
and he must expect rather to enjoy the bare title of King
by a sort of courtesy, than possess the real authority
which belongs to it. Should the princess die before him
without issue, he must descend from the throne, and
give place to the next in succession: And even, if his
bed should be blest with offspring, it seemed dangerous
to expect, that filial piety in his children would prevail
over the ambition of obtaining present possession of re∣gal
power. An act of parliament, indeed, might be
easily procured to settle the crown on him during his life;
but Henry knew how much superior the claim of suc∣cession
by blood was to the votes of an assembly<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Bacon in Kennet's compleat History, p. 579.</NOTE>, which
had always been overborne by violence in the shock of
contending titles, and which had ever been more go∣verned
by the conjunctures of the times, than by any
considerations derived from reason or public interest.</P>
<P>THERE was yet a third foundation, on which Henry
might rest his claim, the right of conquest, by his victory
over Richard, the present possessor of the crown. But
besides that Richard himself was deemed no better than
an usurper, the army, which fought against him, con∣sisted
chiefly of Englishmen; and a right of conquest
over England could never be established by such a victo∣ry.
Nothing also would give greater umbrage to the
nation than a claim of this nature; which might be
construed as an abolition of all their rights and privi∣leges,
and the establishment of despotic authority in the
sovereign<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 579.</NOTE>. William himself, the Norman, tho' at the
head of a powerful and victorious army of foreigners,
had at first declined the invidious title of conqueror; and
<PB N="326" REF="344"/>
it was not till the full establishment of his authority,
that he had ventured to advance so violent and destructive
a pretension.</P>
<P>BUT Henry knew, that there was another foundation
of authority, somewhat resembling the right of conquest,
to wit, present possession; and that this title, guarded
by vigour and ability, would be sufficient to secure per∣petual
possession of the throne. He had before him the
example of Henry the fourth; who, supported by no
better pretension, had subdued many insurrections, and
had been able to transmit the crown peaceably to his
posterity. He was sensible, that this title, which had
been perpetuated thro' three successions of the family of
Lancaster, might still have subsisted, notwithstanding the
preferable claim of the house of York; had not the scep∣ter
devolved into the hands of Henry the sixth, which
were too feeble to sustain it. Instructed by these re∣cent
experiences, Henry was determined to put himself
in present possession of regal authority; and to show all
opposers, that nothing but force of arms and a suc∣cessful
war should be able to expel him. His claim as
heir to the house of Lancaster he was resolved to ad∣vance;
and never allow it to be discussed: And he
hoped that this title, favoured by the partizans of that
family, and seconded by present power, would secure him
a perpetual and an independant authority.</P>
<P>THESE views of Henry are not exposed to much
blame; because founded on good policy, and even on a
species of necessity: But there entered into all his measures
and councils another motive, which admits not of the
same apology.<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's pre∣judice a∣gainst the house of York.</NOTE> The violent contentions, which during
so long a period, had been maintained between the rival
of families of York and Lancaster, and the many san∣guinary
revenges which they had mutually exercised
<PB N="327" REF="345"/>
on each other, had inflamed the opposite factions to
a high pitch of animosity. Henry himself, who had seen
most of his near friends and relations perish in the field or
on the scaffold, and who had been exposed in his own
person to many hardships and dangers, had imbibed a
violent antipathy to the York, party, which no time nor
experience were ever able to efface. Instead of em∣bracing
the present happy opportunity of abolishing these
fatal distinctions, of uniting his title with that of his
spouse, and of bestowing favour indiscriminately on the
friends of both families; he carried into the throne all
the partialities which belong to the head of a faction,
and even the passions, which are carefully guarded against
by every true politician in that situation. To exalt the
Lancastrian party, to depress the retainers of the house
of York, were still the favourite objects of his purfuit;
and thro' the whole course of his reign, he never for∣got
these early prepossessions. Incapable from his na∣tural
temper of a more enlarged and more benevolent
system of policy, he exposed himself to many present in∣conveniencies,
by too anxiously guarding against that fu∣ture
possible event, which might disjoin his title from
that of the princess whom he espoused. And while he
treated the Yorkists as enemies, he soon rendered them
such, and taught them to discuss that right to the crown,
which he so carefully kept separate; and to perceive its
weakness and invalidity.</P>
<P>TO these passions of Henry, as well as to his suspi∣cious
politics, we are to ascribe the measure, which he
embraced two days after the battle of Bosworth. Ed∣ward
Plantagenet, earl of Warwic, son to the unfor∣tunate
duke of Clarence, was detained in a kind of con∣sinement
at Sherif-Hutton in Yorkshire by the jealousy
of his uncle, Richard; whose title to the throne was
<PB N="328" REF="346"/>
inferior to that of the young prince. Warwic had now
reason to expect better treatment, as he was no obstacle
to the succession either of Henry or Elizabeth; and from
a boy of such tender years no danger could reasonably
be apprehended. But Sir Robert Willoughby was dis∣patched
by Henry with orders to take him from Sherif-Hutton,
to convey him to the Tower, and to retain
him in close custody<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 579. Polydore Virgil, p. 565.</NOTE>. The same messenger carried di∣rections,
that the princess Elizabeth, who had been con∣fined
to the same place, should be conducted to Lon∣don,
in order to meet Henry, and there celebrate her
espousals.</P>
<P>HENRY himself set out for the capital, and advanced
by slow journies. Not to rouse the jealousy of the people,
he took, care to avoid all appearance of military triumph;
and so to restrain the insolence of victory, that every
thing about him bore the appearance of an established
monarch, making a peaceable progress thro' his domi∣nions,
rather than of a prince who had opened a way to
the throne by force of arms.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His joyful reception in London.</NOTE> The acclamations of the
people were every where loud, and no less sincere and
hearty._ Besides that a young and victorious prince, on
his accession, was naturally the object of popularity;
the nation promised themselves great felicity from the
new scene, which opened before them. During the
course of near a whole century the kingdom had been
laid waste by domestic wars and convulsions; and if at
any time the noise of arms had ceased, the sound of
faction and discontent still threatened new disorders.
Henry, by his marriage with Elizabeth, seemed to en∣sure
an union of the contending titles of the two fami∣lies;
and having prevailed over a hated tyrant, who had
<PB N="329" REF="347"/>
anew disjointed the succession even of the house of York,
and filled his own family with blood and murder, an un∣feigned
favour was observed every where to attend him.
Numerous and splendid troops of gentry and nobility
accompanied his progress. The mayor and companies of
London received him as he approached the city: The
crouds of people and citizens were zealous in their expres∣sions
of satisfaction. But Henry, amidst these general
effusions of joy, discovered still the stateliness and reserve
of his temper, which made him scorn to court populari∣ty:
He entered London in a close chariot, and would not
gratify the people with a sight of their new monarch.
He went first to St. Paul's church, where he offered
up the standards, taken in the field of battle; and sung
orisons for the victory, which he had there obtained.
He departed thence to the bishop of London's palace,
where lodgings were prepared for him.</P>
<P>BUT Henry did not so much neglect the favour of the
people, as to delay giving them assurance of his marri∣age
with the princess Elizabeth, which he knew to be
so passionately desired by the whole nation. On his
leaving Brittany, he had artfully dropt some hopes, that,
if he should succeed in his enterprize, and obtain the
crown of England, he would espouse Anne, the heiress
of that dutchy; and the report of this engagement had
already reached England, and had begot anxiety in the
people, and even in the princess Elizabeth herself. Henry
took care to dissipate these apprehensions, by solemnly re∣newing,
before the council and principal nobility, the promise,
which he had already given, to celebrate his
marriage with Elizabeth. But tho' bound by honour,
as well as interest, to compleat this alliance, he was re∣solved
to postpone it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His coro∣nation.</NOTE> till the ceremony of his own coro∣nation
should be finished, and till his title should be re∣cognized
<PB N="328" REF="348"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="329" REF="349"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="330" REF="350"/>
by the parliament. Anxious still to support
his personal and hereditary right to the throne, he dreaded
lest a preceding marriage with the princess should inply a
participation of sovereignty in her, and raise doubts of
his own title by the house of Lancaster.</P>
<P>THERE raged at that time in London, and other parts
of the kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sweating sickness.</NOTE> a species of malady, unknown to any
other age or nation, the Sweating sickness, which occa∣sioned
a sudden death to great multitudes; tho' it was
not propagated by any contagious infection, but arose
from the general disposition of the air and of the human
body. In less than twenty-four hours the patient com∣monly
died or recovered; but when the pestilence had
committed ravages for a few weeks, it was observed, ei∣ther
from alterations in the air, or from a more proper re∣gimen,
which had been discovered, to be considerably
abated<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 567.</NOTE>. Preparations were then made for the ceremony
of Henry's coronation. In order to heighten the splen∣dor
of that appearance, he bestowed the rank of knights
banneret on twelve persons; and he conferred peerages
on three. Jasper earl of Pembroke, his uncle, he created
duke of Bedford; Thomas lord Stanley, his father-in-law,
earl of Derby; and Edward Courteney, earl of
Devonshire.<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th of October.</NOTE> At the coronation likewise there appeared
a new institution, which the King had established for se∣curity
as well as pomp, a band of fifty archers, who
were denominated yeomen of the guard. But lest the
people should take umbrage at this unusual symptom of
jealousy in the prince, as if it implied a personal diffi∣dence
of his subjects, he declared the institution to be
perpetual. The ceremony of coronation was performed
by cardinal Bourchier, archbishop of Canterbury.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="351"/>
THE parliament being assembled at Westminster, the
majority immediately appeared to be devoted partizans
of Henry; all persons of another disposition, either de∣clining
to stand in these dangerous times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th of No∣vember. A parlia∣ment.</NOTE> or being ob∣liged
to dissemble their principles and inclinations. The
Lancastrian party had every where been successful in the
elections; and even many of them had been returned
knights and burgesses, who, during the prevalence of the
house of York, had been exposed to the rigour of the
law, and been condemned by sentence of attainder or
outlawry. Their right to take seats in the house being
questioned, the case was reserred to all the judges, who
assembled in the Exchequer Chamber, in order to deli∣berate
on so delicate a subject. The sentence pronounced
was very prudent, and contained a just temperament be∣tween
law and expediency<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 581.</NOTE>. The judges determined,
that the members attainted should forbear taking their
feats till an act were passed for the reversal of their at∣tainder.
There was no difficulty of obtaining this act;
and in it were comprehended an hundred and seven per∣sons
of the King's party<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rot. Parl. 1 Hen. VII. n. 2, 3, 4.—15. 17. 26—65.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>BUT a difficulty was started of a nature still more im∣portant.
The King himself had been attainted; and
his right of succession to the crown might thence be ex∣posed
to some doubt. The judges extricated themselves
from this dangerous question, by a singular position,
which they established; “That the crown takes away
all defects and flops in blood; and that from the time
the King assumed royal authority, the fountain was
cleared, and all attainders and corruptions of blood
discharged<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 58<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>.” Besides that the case, from its urgent
<PB N="332" REF="352"/>
necessity, admitted of no deliberation; the judges pro∣bably
thought, that no sentence of a court of judicature
ought to bar the right of succession; that the jealousy of
a King towards his heir might readily occasion stretches
of law and justice against him; and that a prince might
even be engaged in unjustifiable measures during his pre∣decessor's
reign, without meriting on that account to be
excluded from the throne, which was his birth-right.</P>
<P>WITH a parliament so obsequious as the present, the
King could not fail to obtain whatever act of settlement
he was pleased to require. He seems only to have en∣tertained
some doubts within himself on what title he
should found his pretensions. In his first address to the
parliament he mentioned his just title by hereditary right:
But lest that title should not be esteemed sufficient, he
subjoined his claim by the judgment of God, who had
given him victory over his enemies in the field of battle. And
again, lest this pretension should be interpreted as
assuming a right of conquest, he ensured to his subjects
the entire enjoyment of their former properties and pos∣seffions.</P>
<P>THE entail of the crown was drawn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Entail of the crown.</NOTE> according to the
sense of the King, and probably in the words, dictated
by him. He made no mention in it of the princess Eli∣zabeth,
nor any branch of the family of York; but in
other respects the act was composed with sufficient re∣serve
and moderation. He did not insist, that it should
contain a declaration or recognition of his preceding
right; as on the other hand, he avoided the appearance
of a new law or ordinance. He chose a middle course,
which, as is generally unavoidable in such cases, was
not entirely free from uncertainty and obscurity. It was
voted, “That the inheritance of the crown should rest,
<PB N="333" REF="353"/>
remain, and abide in the King<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 581.</NOTE>;” but whether as
rightful heir, or only as present possessor, was not deter∣mined.
In like manner, the King was contented that
the succession should be secured to the heirs of his body;
but he pretended not, in cafe of their failure, to exclude
the house of York, or give the preference to that of
Lancaster: He left that great point ambiguous for the
present; and trusted, that, if ever its determination:
should become requisite, future incidents would open
the way for the decision.</P>
<P>BUT after all these precautions, the King was so little
satisfied with his own title to the crown, that, in the
following year, he applied to Rome for a confirmation of
it; and as that court gladly laid hold of all opportunities,
which the imprudence, weakness, or necessities of princes
afforded it to extend its authority. Innocent the eighth,
the reigning pope, readily granted a bull, in whatever
terms the King was pleased to desire. All Henry's titles,
by succession, marriage, parliamentary choice, even con∣quest,
are there enumerated; and to the whole the sanc∣tion
of religion is added; excommunication is denounced
against every one who should either disturb him in the
present possession, or the heirs of his body in their future
succession to the crown; and from this penalty, no cri∣minal,
except in the article of death, can be absolved
but by the pope himself, or his special commiffioners. It
is difficult to imagine, that the security derived from this
bull, could be a compensation for the defect which it be∣trayed
in Henry's title, and for the danger of thus invit∣ing
the pope to interpose in these concerns.</P>
<P>IT was natural, and even laudable in Henry to reverse
the attainders, which had passed against the partizans of
<PB N="334" REF="354"/>
the house of Lancaster: But the revenges, which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
exercised against the retainers of the York family, to
which he was so soon to be allied, cannot be consdered
in the same light. Yet the parliament, at his instiga∣tion,
passed an act of attainder against the late King
himself, against the duke of Norfolk, the earl of Surrey,
viscount Lovel, the lords Zouche and Ferrars of Chart∣ley,
Sir Walter and Sir James Harrington, Sir William
Berkeley, Sir Humphrey Stafford, Catesby, and about
twenty other gentlemen, who had fought on Richard's
side in the battle of Bosworth. How men could be guilty
of treason, by supporting the King in possession against
the earl of Richmond, who assumed not the title of
King, it was not easy to determine; and nothing but a
servile complaisance in the parliament could have en∣gaged
them to make this stretch of justice. Nor was it
a small mortification to the people in general, to find,
that the King, prompted either by avarice or resent∣ment,
could, in the very beginning of his reign, so far
violate the cordial union, which had been previously
concerted between the parties, and to the expectation of
which he had plainly owed his succession to the throne.</P>
<P>THE King, having gained so many points of conse∣quence
from his parliament, thought it not expedient to
demand any supply from them, which the profound peace
enjoyed by the nation, and the late forfeitures of Rich∣ard's
adherents, seemed to render so me what superfluous.
The parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th of December.</NOTE> however, conferred on him during life
the duty of tonnage and poundage, which had been
enjoyed in the same manner by some of his immediate
predecessors; and they added, before they broke up,
other lucrative bills of no great moment. The King,
on his part, made some returns of grace and favour to
his people. He published his royal proclamation, offer∣ing
<PB N="335" REF="355"/>
pardon to all such, as had taken arms, or formed any
attempts against him; provided they submitted them∣selves
to mercy by a certain day, and took the usual oath
of fealty and allegiance. Upon this proclamation many
came out of their sanctuaries, and the minds of men
were every where much quieted. Henry chose to take
wholly to himself the merit of an act of grace, so agree∣able
to the nation; rather than communicate it with
the parliament, (as was his first intention) by passing a
bill to that purpose. The earl of Surrey, however,
tho' he had submitted, and delivered himself into the
King's hands, was sent prisoner to the Tower.</P>
<P>DURING this parliament, the King also bestowed fa∣vours
and honours on some particular persons, who were
attached to him. Edward Stafford, eldest son to the
duke of Buckingham, forfeited in the late reign, was
restored to all the honours of his family, as well as to
all its fortune, which was very ample. This genero∣sity,
so unusual in Henry, was the effect of his grati∣tude
to the memory of Buckingham, who had first con∣certed
the plan of his succession to the crown, and who
by his own ruin had made way for that great event.
Chandos of Brittany was created earl of Bath, Sir Giles
Daubeny lord Daubeny, and Sir Robert Willoughby
lord Broke. These were all the titles of nobility con∣ferred
by the King<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 566.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the ministers, whom the King most trusted and
favoured, were not chosen from among the nobility, or
even from among the laity. John Morton, and Richard
Fox, two clergymen, persons of industry, vigilance, and
capacity, were the men to whom he chiefly confided
his affairs and secret councils. They had shared with
<PB N="336" REF="356"/>
him all his former dangers and distresses; and he now
took care to make them participate in his good fortune.
They were both called to the privy council; and Mor∣ton
was created bishop of Ely, Fox of Exeter. The
former soon after, upon the death of Bourchier, was
raised to the see of Canterbury. The latter was made
lord privy seal; and successively, bishop of Bath and
Wells, Durham, and Winchester. For Henry, as lord
Bacon observes, loved to employ and advance prelates,
because, having rich bishoprics to bestow, it was easy for
him to reward their services: And it was his maxim to
raise them by slow steps, and make them first pass thro'
the inferior bishoprics<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 582.</NOTE>. He probably expected, that as
they were naturally more dependant on him than the no∣bility,
who, during that age, enjoyed possessions and ju∣risdictions
dangerous to royal authority; so the prospect
of some farther elevation would render them still more
active in his service, and more obsequious to his com∣mands.</P>
<P>IN presenting the bill of tonnage and poundage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1486.</NOTE> the
parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th of Ja∣nuary.</NOTE> anxious to preserve the true and undisputed
succession to the crown, had petitioned Henry, with de∣monstrations
of the greatest earnestness, to espouse the
princess Elizabeth; but they covered their real reason
under the dutiful pretence of their desire to have heirs of
his body. He now thought in earnest of satisfying
the minds of his people in that particular.<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's marriage.</NOTE> His marriage
was celebrated at London; and that with greater appear∣ance
of universal joy, than either his first entry or his
coronation. Henry remarked with much displeasure this
general favour which was borne the house of York. The
suspicions, which arose from it, not only disturbed his
<PB N="337" REF="357"/>
tranquillity during his whole reign, but bred disgust to∣wards
his spouse herself, and poisoned all his domestic
enjoyments. Tho' virtuous, amiable, and obsequious
to the last degree, she never met with a proper return of
affection, or even of complaisance from her husband;
and the malignant ideas of faction still, in his sullen
mind, prevailed over all the sentiments of conjugal
tenderness.</P>
<P>THE King had been carried along with such a tide
of success ever since his arrival in England, that he
thought nothing could withstand the fortune, and au∣thority
which attended him. He now resolved to make
a progress into the North, where the friends of the house
of York, and even the partizans of Richard, were most
numerous; in hopes of curing, by his presence and con∣versation,
the prejudices of the malecontents. When he
arrived at Nottingham, he heard that viscount Lovel,
with Sir Humphrey Stafford and Thomas, his brother,
had withdrawn themselves secretly from their sanctuary
at Colchester: But this news appeared not to him of
such importance as to stop his journey; and he proceeded
forward to York.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An insur∣rection.</NOTE> He there heard, that the Staffords
had levied an army in the county of Worcester, and
were approaching to besiege that city: And that Lovel,
at the head of an army of three or four thousand men,
was marching to attack him in York. Henry was not
dismayed with this intelligence. His active courage,
full of resources, immediately prompted him to find the
proper remedy. Tho' he knew himself to be surrounded
with enemies in these disaffected counties, he assembled
a small body of troops, in whom he could confide; and
he put them under the command of the duke of Bedford.
He joined to them all his own attendants; but he found
that this hasty armament was more formidable by their
<PB N="338" REF="358"/>
spirit and their zealous attachment to him, than by
the arms or military stores of which they were provided.
He therefore gave Bedford orders not to approach the
enemy; but previously to try every proper expedient to
dissipate them. Bedford published a general promise of
pardon to the rebels, which had a greater effect on their
leader than on his followers. Lovel, who had under∣taken
an enterprize, that exceeded his courage and ca∣pacity,
was so terrified with the fears of desertion among
his troops, that he suddenly withdrew himself, and, after
lurking some time in Lancashire, he made his escape
into Flanders, where he was protected by the dutchess
of Burgundy. His army submitted to the King's cle∣mency;
and the other rebels, hearing of this success,
raised the siege of Worcester, and dispersed themselves.
The Staffords took fanctuary in the church of Colnham,
a village near Abingdon; but as it was found, that that
church had not the privilege of giving protection to re∣bels,
they were taken thence: The eldest Stafford was
executed at Tyburn; the younger, pleading that he
was misled by his brother, obtained a pardon<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 569.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY's joy for this success was followed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th of September.</NOTE> some time
after, by the birth of a prince, to whom he gave the
name of Arthur, in memory of the famous British King
of that name, from whom, it was pretended, the family
of Tudor derived their descent.</P>
<P>THO' Henry had been able to dissipate that hasty re∣bellion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discontents of the peo∣ple.</NOTE>
which was raised by the relicts of Richard's par∣tizans,
his government was become in general very un∣popular:
The source of the public discontent arose chiefly
from his prejudice against the house of York, which was
universally beloved by the nation, and which, for that
<PB N="339" REF="359"/>
very reason, became every day more the object of his
hatred and jealousy. Not only a preference on all occa∣sions,
it was observed, was given to the Lancastrians;
but many of the opposite party had been exposed to great
soverity, and had been bereaved of their fortunes by acts
of attainder. A general resumption likewise had passed
of all grants made by the princes of the house of York;
and tho' this rigour had been covered under the pretence,
that the revenue was become insufficient to support the
crown, and tho' the liberalities, granted during the latter
years of Henry the sixth, were resumed by the same
law, yet the York-party, as they were the principal suf∣ferers
by the resumption, thought it chiefly levelled
against them. The severity, exercised against the earl
of Warwic, begot compassion towards youth and inno∣cence,
exposed to such oppression; and his confinement
in the Tower, the very place where Edward's children
had been murdered by their uncle, made the public ex∣pect
a like catastrophe for him, and led them to make a
comparison between Henry and that detested tyrant.
And when it was remarked, that the Queen herself met
with harsh treatment, and even after the birth of a son,
was not admitted to the honour of a public coronation,
Henry's prepossessions were then concluded to be abso∣lutely
incurable, and men became equally obstinate in
their disgust against his government. Nor was the man∣ner
and address of the King calculated to cure these
prejudices contracted against his administration; but had,
in every thing, a tendency to promote fear, or at best
reverence, rather than good-will and affection<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 583.</NOTE>. And
while the high, idea, entertained of his policy and vigour,
retained the nobility and men of character in obedience;
the effects of his unpopular government soon appeared
<PB N="340" REF="360"/>
in the public, by incidents of a very extraordinary na∣ture.</P>
<P>THERE lived in Oxford, one Richard Simon, a priest,
who possessed some subtlety, and still more boldness and
temerity. This man had entertained the design of
disturbing Henry's government, by raising up a pretender
to his crown; and for that purpose, he cast his eyes
on Lambert Simnel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lambert Simnel.</NOTE> a youth of fifteen years of age,
who was son of a baker, and who, being endowed with
understanding above his years, and address above his
condition, seemed well fitted to personate a prince of
royal extraction. A report had been spread among the
people, and received with great avidity, that Richard,
duke of York, second son to Edward the fourth, had,
by a secret escape, saved himself from his uncle's cruelty,
and lay somewhere concealed in England. Simon, taking
advantage of this rumour, had at first instructed his pu∣pil
to assume that name, which he found to be so fondly
cherished by the public: But hearing afterwards a new
report, that Warwic had made his escape from the
Tower, and observing that this news was attended with
no less general satisfaction, he changed the plan of his
imposture, and made Simnel personate that unfortunate
prince<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 569, 570.</NOTE>. Tho' the youth was qualified by nature for the
part which he was instructed to act; yet was it remarked,
that he was better informed in circumstances relating to
the royal family, and particularly in the adventures of
the earl of Warwic, than he could be supposed to have
learned from one of Simon's condition: And it was
thence conjectured, that persons of higher rank, parti∣zans
of the house of York, had laid the plan of this con∣spiracy,
and had conveyed proper instructions to the
actors. The Queen dowager herself was exposed to
<PB N="341" REF="361"/>
great suspicion; and it was indeed the general opinion,
however unlikely it might seem, that she had secretly
given her consent to this imposture. This woman was
of a very restless disposition. That character of ambi∣tion
and intrigue, which she had betrayed during the
reign of her husband, had not abandoned her during
the usurpation of Richard; and in her closet was first
laid the plan of the great confederacy, which overturned
the throne of the tyrant, and raised the earl of Rich∣mond
to royal dignity. Finding, that, instead of re∣ceiving
the reward of these srvices, she herself was
fallen into absolute insignificance, her daughter treated
with severity, and all her friends brought under sub∣jection,
she had conceived the most violent animosity
against Henry, and had resolved to make him feel the
effects of her resentment. The impostor, she knew,
however successful, might easily at last be set aside; and
if a way could be found at his risque to subvert the King's
government, she hoped that a scene would be opened,
which, tho' difficult, at present exactly to foresee, would
gratify her revenge, and be on the whole less irksome
to her, than that slavery and contempt, to which she
was reduced<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 570.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT whatever care Simon might take to convey in∣struction
to his pupil, Simnel, he knew, that the im∣posture
would not bear a close inspection; and he was
therefore determined to open the first public scene of it
in Ireland. That island, which was zealously attached
to the house of York, and bore an affectionate regard to
the memory of Clarence, Warwic's father, who had
been their lieutenant, was improvidently allowed by Hen∣ry
to remain in the same condition, in which he found it;
and all the counsellors and officers, who had been ap∣pointed
<PB N="342" REF="362"/>
by his predecessor, still retained their authority.
No sooner did Simnel present himself to Thomas Fitz∣gerald,
earl of Kildare, the deputy, and claim his pro∣tection
as the unfortunate Warwic, than that credulous
nobleman, not suspecting so bold a fiction, lent attension
to him, and began to consult some persons of rank with
regard to this extraordinary incident. These he found
even more sanguine in their zeal and belief than himself:
And in proportion as the story diffused itself among those
of lower condition, it became the object of still higher
passion and credulity; till the people in Dublin with
one consent tendered their allegiance to Simnel, as to
the true Plantagenet. Fond of a novelty, which flat∣tered
their natural propension, they overlooked the daugh∣ters
of Edward the fourth, who stood before Warwic in
of the order of succession;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolt of Ireland.</NOTE> they payed the pretended prince
attendance as their sovereign, lodged him in the castle
of Dublin, crowned him with a diadem taken from a sta∣tue
of the virgin, and publicly proclaimed him King,
under the appellation of Edward the sixth. The whole
island followed the example of the capital; and not a
sword was any where drawn in Henry's quarrel.</P>
<P>WHEN this intelligence was conveyed to Henry, it
reduced him to some perplexity. Determined always to
face his enemies in person, he yet scrupled at present to
leave England, where he suspected the conspiracy was
first framed, and where, he knew, many persons of con∣dition,
and the people in general were much disposed to
give it countenance. In order to discover the secret
source of the contrivance, and take measures against
this open revolt, he held frequent consultations with his
ministers and counsellors, and laid plans for a vigorous
defence of his authority, and the suppression of his ene∣mies.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="363"/>
THE first event, which followed these deliberations,
gave great surprize to the public: It was the seizure of
the Queen, dowager, the forfeiture of all her lands and
revenue, and the close confinement of her person in the
nunnery of Bermondesey. So arbitrary and violent an
act of authority was covered with a very thin pretence.
It was alleged, that, notwithstanding the secret agree∣ment
to marry her daughter to Henry, she had yet yield∣ed
to the solicitations and menaces of Richard, and de∣livered
that princess and her sisters into the hands of
the tyrant. This crime, which was now become ob∣solete,
and might admit of alleviations, was therefore
suspected not to be the real cause of the severity, with
which she was treated; and men believed, that the
King, unwilling to accuse so near a relation of a con∣spiracy
against him, had cloaked his vengeance or pre∣caution
under the pretext of an offence, known to the
whole world<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 583. Polydore Virgil, p. 571.</NOTE>. They were afterwards the more con∣firmed
in this suspicion, when they found, that the un∣fortunate
Queen, tho' she survived this disgrace several
years, was never treated with any more lenity, but was
allowed to end her life in poverty, solitude, and con∣finement.</P>
<P>THE next measure of the King was of a less ex∣ceptionable
nature. He ordered that Warwic should be
taken from the Tower, be led in procession through the
streets of London, be conducted to St. Paul's, and there
exposed to the eyes of the whole people. He even gave
directions, that some persons of condition, who were
attached to the house of York, and were best acquainted
with the person of this prince, should approach him
and converse with him: And he trusted, that these, being
convinced of the absurd imposture of Simnel, would
<PB N="344" REF="364"/>
put a stop to the credulity of the people. The expedient
had its effect in England: But in Ireland the people still
persisted in their revolt, and zealously retorted on the
King the reproach of propagating an imposture, and of
having shewn a counterfeit Warwic to the people.</P>
<P>HENRY had soon reason to apprehend, that the de∣sign
against him was not laid on such <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>light foundations
as the absurdity of the contrivance seemed to promise.
John earl of Lincoln, son of John de la Pole, duke of
Suffolk, and of Elizabeth, eldest sister to Edward the
fourth, was engaged to take part in the conspiracy.
This nobleman, who possest capacity and courage, had
entertained very aspiring views; and his ambition was
encouraged by the known intentions of his uncle, Ri∣chard,
who had formed a design, in case himself should
die without issue, of declaring Lincoln successor to
the crown. The King's jealousy against all eminent
persons of the York-party, and his rigour towards War∣wic,
had farther struck Lincoln with apprehensions, and
made him resolve to seek for safety in the most dangerous
councils. Having fixed a secret correspondence with Sir
Thomas Broughton, a man of great interest in Lan∣cashire,
he set out for Flanders, where Lovel had arrived
a little before him; and he lived, during some time, in
the court of his aunt, the dutchess of Burgundy, by
whom he had been invited over.</P>
<P>MARGARET,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrigues of the dutch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess of Burgundy.</NOTE> widow of Charles the Bold, duke of
Burgundy, having born no children to her husband, at∣tached
herself with an entire friendship to her daughter-in-law,
married to Maximilian, archduke of Austria;
and after the death of that princess, she persevered in her
affection to Philip and Margaret, her children, and oc∣cupied
herself in the care of their education and of their
persons. By her virtuous conduct and demeanor, she
<PB N="345" REF="365"/>
had acquired great authority among the Flemings; and
lived with much dignity, as well as oeconomy, upon that
ample dowry, which she inherited from her husband.
The resentments of this princess were no less warm than
her friendships; and that spirit of faction, which it is so
difficult for a social and sanguine temper to guard against,
had taken strong possession of her heart, and entrenched
somewhat on the probity, which shone forth in other
parts of her character. Hearing of the malignant jea∣lousy,
entertained by Henry against her family, and his
oppression of all its partizans; she was moved with
the highest indignation, and she determined to make
him repent of that enmity, of which so many of her
friends, without any reason or necessity, had fallen the
victims. After consulting with Lincoln and Lovel, she
hired a body of two thousand veteran Germans, under
the command of Martin Swart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1487.</NOTE> a brave and experienced
officer<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 572, 573.</NOTE>; and sent them over, together with these two
noblemen, to join Simnel in Ireland. The countenance,
given by persons of such high condition, and the ac∣cession
of this military force, raised extremely the courage
of the Irish, and made them entertain the resolution of
invading England, where they believed the spirit of dis∣affection
to prevail as much as it had appeared to do in
Ireland.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lambert Simnel invades Eng∣land.</NOTE>. The poverty also, under which they laboured,
made it impossible for them to maintain any longer their
new court and army, and inspired them with a strong
desire of enriching themselves by plunder and preferment
in England.</P>
<P>HENRY was not ignorant of these intentions of his
enemies; and he prepared himself for resistance. He or∣dered
troops to be mustered in different parts of the king∣dom,
<PB N="346" REF="366"/>
and put them under the command or the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Bedford, and the earl of Oxford. He consin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

would revenge the injuries suffered by his mother, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Queen dowager: And to gratify the people by an ap∣pearance
of devotion, he made a pilgrimage to our lady
of Walsingham, famous for miracles; and there offered
up prayers for succese and for deliverance from his ene∣mies.</P>
<P>BEING informed that Simnel and his forces were land∣ed
at Foudrey in Lancashire, he drew together his own
troops, and advanced towards them as far as Coventry.
The rebels had entertained hopes, that the disaffected
counties in the North would rise in their favour: But
the people, averse to join Irish and German invaders,
convinced of Lambert's imposture, and kept in awe by
the King's reputation for success and conduct, either
remained in tranquillity, or gave all assistance to the
royal army. The earl of Lincoln, therefore, who com∣manded
the rebels, finding no hopes but in speedy vic∣tory,
was determined to bring the matter to a decision;
and the King, supported by the native courage of his
temper, and emboldened by a great accession of volunteers,
which had joined him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th of June.</NOTE> under the earl of Shrewsbury
and lord Strange,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Stoke.</NOTE> declined not the combat. The op∣posite
armies met at Stoke in the county of Notingham,
and fought a battle, which was more bloody and more
obstinately disputed than could have been expected from
the inequality of their force. All the leaders of the re∣bels
were resolved to conquer or to die, and they inspired
their troops with a like resolution. The Germans also,
being veteran and experienced soldiers, kept the victory
long doubtful; and even the Irish, tho' ill-armed and
almost defenceless, showed themselves not defective in
spirit and bravery. The King's victory was purchased
<PB N="347" REF="367"/>
with loss, but was entirely decisive. Lincoln, Brough∣ton
and Swart perished in the field of battle, with four
thousand of their troops. As Lovel was never more
heard of, he was believed to have undergone the same
fate. Simnel with his tutor, Simon, was taken pri∣soner.
Simon, being a priest, was not tried at law, and
was only committed to close custody: Simnel was too
contemptible either to excite apprehension or resentment
in Henry. He was pardoned, and made a scullion in
the King's kitchen; whence he was afterwards advanced
to the rank of a falconer<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 586. Pol. Virg. P. 574.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY had now leisure to revenge himself of his
enemies. He made a progress into the northern parts,
where he gave many proofs of the rigours of his justice.
A strict enquiry was made after those who had assisted or
favoured the rebels. The punishments were not all san∣guinary.
The King made his revenge subservient to his
avarice. Heavy fines were levied upon the delinquents.
In giving sentence, the proceedings of the courts, and
even the courts themselves, were entirely arbitrary.
Either the criminals were tried by commissioners ap∣pointed
for that purpose, or they suffered punishment
by sentence of a court-martial. And as a rumour had
prevailed before the battle of Stoke, that the rebels had
gained the victory, that the King's army was cut in
pieces, and that the King himself had escaped by flight,
Henry was resolved to interpret the belief or propaga∣tion
of this report as a mark of disaffection; and he
punished many for that pretended crime. But such, in
this age, was the situation of the English government,
that the royal prerogative, which was but imperfectly
restrained during the most peaceable periods, was sure,
<PB N="348" REF="368"/>
in tumultuous, or even suspicious times, which fre∣quently
occurred, to break all bounds of law and or∣der.</P>
<P>AFTER the King had satisfied his rigour by the punish∣ment
of his enemies, he resolved to give contentment to
the people, in a point, which, tho' a mere ceremony,
was very passionately desired by them. The Queen had
been married near two years, but had not yet been
crowned; and this affectation of delay had given great
discontent to the public, and had been one principal
source of the disaffection which prevailed. The King,
instructed by experience,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th of No∣vember.</NOTE> now finished the ceremony of
her coronation; and to shew a still more gracious dis∣position,
he gave liberty to her half-brother, the marquis
of Dorset, who had been able to clear himself of all the
crimes of which he was accused.</P>

<P>THE King acquired great reputation throughout all<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXV.</NOTE>
Europe by the prosperous and vigorous conduct
of his domestic affairs;<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of fo∣reign af∣fairs.</NOTE> and as some incidents, about
this time, invited him to look abroad,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1488.</NOTE> and exert him∣self
in behalf of his allies, it will be necessary, in order
to give a just account of his foreign measures, to explain
the condition of the neighbouring kingdoms; beginning
with Scotland, which lies most contiguous.</P>
<P>THE kingdom of Scotland had not as yet attained that<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Scotland.</NOTE>
state, which distinguishes a civilized monarchy, and
Scotland, which enables the government, by the force of its laws
and institutions alone, without any extraordinary capa∣city
in the sovereign, to maintain itself in order and
tranquillity. James the Third, who now filled the
<PB N="350" REF="370"/>
throne, was a prince of little industry and of a narrow
genius; and tho' it behoved him to yield the reins of
government to his ministers, he had never been able to
make any choice, which could give contentment both to
himself and to his people. When he bestowed his con∣fidence
on any of the principal nobility, he found, that
they exalted their own family to such a height, as was
dangerous to the prince, and gave umbrage to the state:
When he conferred favour on any person of meaner
birth, on whose submission he could more depend, the
barons of his kingdom, enraged at the power of an up∣start
minion, proceeded to the utmost extremities against
their sovereign. Had Henry entertained the ambition of
conquests, a tempting opportunity now offered of re∣ducing
that kingdom to subjection; but as he was pro∣bably
sensible, that a warlike people, tho' they might be
over-run by reason of their domestic divisions, could not
be retained in obedience without a regular military force,
which was then unknown in England, he rather pro∣posed
the renewal of the peace with Scotland, and sent
an embassy to James for that purpose. But the Scots,
who never desired a long peace with England, and who
thought that their security consisted in preserving them∣selves
constantly in a warlike posture, would not agree
to more than a seven years truce, which was accordingly
concluded<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Polyd. Virg. p. 575.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE European states on the continent were then
hastening fast to that situation, in which they have re∣mained,
without any material alterations, for near three
centuries; and began to unite themselves into one ex∣tensive
system of policy, which comprehended the chief
powers of Christendom.<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Spain.</NOTE> Spain, which had hitherto
been almost entirely occupied within herself, now be∣came
<PB N="351" REF="371" MS="y"/>
formidable by the union of Arragon and Castile, in
the persons of Ferdinand and Isabella, who, being princes
of great capacity, employed their force in enterprizes the
most advantageous to their combined monarchy. The
conquest of Granada from the Moors was then under∣taken,
and brought near to a happy conclusion. And
in that expedition the military genius of Spain was re∣vived;
honour and security were attained; and her
princes, no longer held in fear by a domestic enemy <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o
dangerous, began to enter into all the transactions of
Europe, and make a great figure in every war and ne∣gotiation.</P>
<P>MAXIMILIAN,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Low Countries.</NOTE> King of the Romans, son to the em∣peror
Frederic, had, by his marriage with the heiress of
the house of Burgundy, acquired an interest in the Low
Country provinces; and tho' the death of his spouse had
weakened his connection with that territory, he still
pretended to the government as tutor to his son Philip,
and his authority had been acknowledged by Brabant,
Holland, and several of the provinces. But as Flanders
and Hainault still refused to submit to his regency, and
even appointed other tutors to Philip, he had been en∣gaged
in long wars against that obstinate people, and
never was able thoroughly to subdue their spirit. That
he might free himself from the opposition of France, he
had concluded a peace with Lewis the Eleventh, and
had given his daughter Margaret, then an infant, in
marriage to the Dauphin; together with Artois,
Franche-Compté, and Charolois as her dowry. But this
alliance had not produced the desired effect:. The Dau∣phin
succeeded to the crown of France under the appel∣lation
of Charles the Eighth; but Maximilian still found
the mutinies of the Flemings fomented by the intrigues
of the court of France.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="372"/>
FRANCE, during the two preceding reigns, had made
a mighty encrease in power and greatness; and had not
other states of Europe at the same time received an ac∣cession
of force,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of France.</NOTE> it had been impossible to have retained
her within her antient boundaries. Most of the great
fiefs, Normandy, Champagne, Anjou, Dauphiny, Gui∣enne,
Provence, and Burgundy had been united to the
crown; the English had been expelled from all their
conqnests; the authority of the prince had been raised
to such a condition as enabled him to maintain law and
order; a considerable military force was kept on foot,
and the finances were able to support them. Lewis the
Eleventh indeed, from whom many of these advantages
were derived, was dead, and had left his son, in very
early youth and ill educated, to sustain the weight of the
monarchy: But having entrusted the government to his
daughter, Anne, Lady of Beaujeu, a woman of spirit and
capacity, the French power suffered no check or decline.
On the contrary, this princess formed the great project,
which at last she happily effected, of uniting to the crown
Britanny, the last and most independent fief of the
monarchy.</P>
<P>FRANCIS the Second,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Britanny.</NOTE> duke of Britanny, was a good,
but a weak prince, who, conscious of his own unfitness
for government, had resigned himself entirely to the di∣rection
of Peter Landais, a man of very mean birth,
more remarkable for his ability than for his virtue or in∣tegrity.
The nobles of Britanny, displeased with the
great advancement of this favourite, had even proceeded
to disaffection against their sovereign; and after many
tumults and conspiracies, they at last united among
themselves, and in a violent manner, seized, tried, and
put to death the obnoxious minister. Fearing the resent∣ment
of the prince for this invasion of his authority,
<PB N="353" REF="373"/>
many of them retired to France; and others, for their
protection and safety, maintained a correspondence with
that court. The French ministry, observing the great
dissentions among the Bretons, thought the opportunity
favourable for invading that dutchy; and so much the
rather as they could cover their ambition under the specious
pretence of providing for domestic security.</P>
<P>LEWIS, duke of Orleans, first prince of the blood,
and presumptive heir of the monarchy, had disputed the
administration with the lady of Beaujeu; and tho' his
pretensions had been rejected by the states, he still main∣tained
cabals with many of the grandees, and laid
schemes for subverting the authority of that princess.
Finding his conspiracies detected, he took arms, and
fortified himself in Beaugenci; but as his revolt was
precipitate, before his confederates were ready to rise
with him, he had been obliged to submit, and to receive
whatever conditions the French ministry were pleased to
impose upon him. Actuated however by his ambition,
and even by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his fears, he soon retired out of France,
and took shelter with the duke of Britanny, who was
desirous of strengthening himself against the designs
of the lady of Beaujeu by the friendship and credit of the
duke of Orleans. This prince also, observing the
ascendant which he soon acquired over the duke of Bri∣tanny,
had engaged many of his partizans to join him
at that court, and had formed the design of aggrandizing
himself by a marriage with Anne, the heiress of that
opulent dutchy.</P>
<P>THE barons of Britanny, who saw all favour engrossed
by the duke of Orleans and his train, renewed a stricter
correspondence with France, and even invited the French
King to make an invasion on their country. Desirous
<PB N="354" REF="374"/>
however to preserve its independancy, they had regu∣lated
the number of succours, which France was to send
them, and had stipulated that no fortified place in Bri∣tanny
should remain in the possession of that monarchy.
A vain precaution, where revolted subjects treat with a
power so much superior!<NOTE PLACE="marg">French in∣vasion of Britanny.</NOTE> The French invaded Britan∣ny
with forces three times more numerous than those
which they had promised to the barons; and advancing
into the heart of the country, laid siege to Ploermel.
To oppose them, the duke raised a numerous, but ill-disciplined
army, which he put under the command of
the duke of Orleans, the count of Dunois, and others
of the French nobility. The army, discontented with
this choice, and jealous of their confederates, soon dis∣banded,
and left their prince with too small a force to
keep the field against his invaders. He retired to
Vannes; but being hotly pursued by the French, who
had made themselves masters of Ploermel, he escaped
to Nantz; and the enemy, having taken and garrisoned
Vannes, Dinant, and other places, laid close siege to
that city. The barons of Britanny, finding their coun∣try
menaced with total subjection, began gradually to
withdraw from the French army, and to make peace
with their sovereign.</P>
<P>THIS desertion, however, of the Bretons discouraged
not the court of France from pursuing her favourite
project of reducing Britanny to subjection. The situa∣tion
of Europe appeared very favourable to the execution
of this design. Maximilian was engaged in close
alliance with the duke of Britanny, and had even open∣ed
a treaty for marrying his daughter; but he was on all
occasions so necessitous of money, and at that time so
disquicted by the mutinies of the Flemings, that little
<PB N="355" REF="375"/>
effectual assistance could be expected from him. Fer∣dinand
was entirely occupied in the conquest of Granada;
and it was also known, that if France resigned to him
Rousillon and Cerdagne, to which he had pretensions,
she could at any time engage him to abandon the inte∣rests
of Britanny. England alone was both enabled by
her power, and engaged by her interests, to support the
independency of that dutchy; and the most dangerous
opposition was therefore, by the French, expected from
that quarter. In order to cover their real designs, no
sooner were they informed of Henry's success against
Simnel and his partizans, than they dispatched ambas∣sadors
to the court of London, and made professions of
the utmost trust and confidence in that monarch.</P>
<P>THE ambassadors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">French em∣bassy to England.</NOTE> after congratulating Henry on the
late victory, and communicating to him in the most cor∣dial
manner, as to an intimate friend, some successes of
their master against Maximilian, came in the progress of
their discourse to mention the late transactions in Bri∣tanny.
They told him that the duke of Britanny hav∣ing
given protection to French sugitives and rebels, the
King had been necessitated, contrary to his intention and
inclination, to carry war into that dutchy: That the ho∣nour
of the crown was interested not to suffer a vassal so
far to forget his duty to his liege lord; nor was the se∣curity
of the government of France less concerned to
prevent the consequences of this dangerous temerity:
That the fugitives were no mean nor obscure persons;
but, among others, the duke of Orleans, first prince of
the blood, who, finding himself obnoxious to justice for
treasonable practices in France, had fled into Britanny;
where he still persevered in laying schemes of rebellion
against his sovereign: That the war being thus, on the
<PB N="356" REF="376"/>
part of the French monarch, entirely defensive, it would
immediately cease, when the duke of Britanny, by re∣turning
to his duty, should remove the causes of it:
That their master was sensible of the obligations which
that duke, in very critical times, had conferred on
Henry; but it was known also, that in times still more
critical, he or his mercenary counsellors had deserted
him, and put his life in the utmost hazard: That his
sole refuge in such desperate extremities had been the
court of France, which not only protected his person,
but supplied him with men and money, with which,
aided by his own valour and conduct, he had been en∣abled
to mount the throne of England: That France,
in this transaction, had, from friendship to Henry, acted
contrary to what, in a narrow view, might be esteemed
her own interest; since, instead of an odious tyrant, she
had contributed to establish on a rival throne a prince
endowed with such virtue and ability: And that as both
the justice of the cause and the obligations conferred on
Henry thus preponderated on the side of France, their
master expected, that, if the situation of Henry's affairs
allowed him not to give assistance to that kingdom, he
would at least preserve a neutrality between the contend∣ing
parties<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 589.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS discourse of the French ambassadors was plau∣sible;
and to give it greater weight, they communicated
to Henry, as in confidence, their master's intention,
after he should have composed the differences with Bri∣tanny,
to lead an army into Italy, and make good his
pretensions to the kingdom of Naples: A project, which,
they knew, would give no umbrage to the court of Eng∣land.
<PB N="357" REF="377"/>
But all these artifices were in vain employed
against the penetration of the King. He clearly saw,
that France had entertained the view of subduing Bri∣tanny;
but he also perceived, that she would meet with
great, and, as he thought, insuperable difficulties in the
execution of her project. The native force of that dut∣chy,
he knew, had always been considerable, and had
often, without any foreign assistance, resisted the power
of France; the natural temper of the French nation,
he imagined, would make them easily abandon every
enterprize, which required perseverance; and as the
heir of the crown was confederated with the duke of
Britanny, the courtiers would be still more remiss in pro∣secuting
a scheme which must draw on them his resent∣ment
and displeasure. Should even these internal ob∣structions
be removed, Maximilian, whose enmity to
France was well known, and who now paid his addresses
to the heiress of Britanny, would be able to make a di∣version
on the side of Flanders; nor could it be expected
that France, if she prosecuted such ambitious projects,
would be allowed to remain in tranquillity by Fer∣dinand
and Isabella. Above all, he thought, the French
court could never expect, that England, so deeply in∣terested
to preserve the independancy of Britanny, so
able by her power and situation to give effectual and
prompt assistance, would permit such an accession of
force to her rival. He imagined, therefore, that the mi∣nisters
of France, convinced of the impracticability of
their schemes, would at last embrace pacific views, and
would abandon an enterprize, so obnoxious to all the
potentates of Europe.</P>
<P>THIS reasoning of Henry was solid, and might very
justly engage him in dilatory and cautious measures:
<PB N="358" REF="378"/>
But there entered into his conduct another motive, which
was apt to draw him beyond the just bounds, because
founded on a ruling passion. His frugality, which by
degrees degenerated into avarice, made him averse to all
warlike enterprizes and distant expeditions; and engaged
him previously to try the expedient of negotiation. He
dispatched Urswic, his almoner, a man of address and
ability, to make offer of his mediation to the contending
parties: An offer, which, he thought, if accepted by
France, would soon lead to a composure of all diffe∣rences;
if refused or eluded, would at least discover the
perseverance of that court in their ambitious projects.
Urswic found the lady of Beaujeu, now dutchess of
Bourbon, engaged in the siege of Nantz, and had the
satisfaction to find that his master's mediation was very
readily embraced, and with many expressions of confi∣dence
and moderation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dissimula∣tion of the French court.</NOTE> That able princess concluded,
that the duke of Orleans, who governed the court of Bri∣tanny,
foreseeing that every accommodation must be
made at his expence, would use all his interest to have
Henry's proposal rejected; and would by that means
make an effectual apology for the French measures, and
draw on the Bretons the reproach of obstinacy and in∣justice.
The event justified her prudence. When the
English ambassador made the same applications to the
duke of Britanny, he received for answer, in the name
of that prince, that having so long acted the part of pro∣tector
and guardian to Henry, during his youth and ad∣versity,
he had expected, from a monarch of such virtue,
more effectual assistance, in his present distreffes, than
a barren offer of mediation, which suspended not the
progress of the French arms: That if Henry's gratitude
was not sufficient to engage him in such a measure, his
prudence, as King of England, should discover to him
<PB N="359" REF="379"/>
the pernicious consequences attending the conquest of
Brittany, and its annexation to the crown of France:
That that kingdom, already become too powerful, would
be enabled, by so great an accession of force, to display,
to the ruin of England, that hostile disposition, which
had always subsisted between those rival nations: That
Brittany, so useful an ally, which, by its situation, gave
the English an entrance into the heart of France; being
annexed to that kingdom, would be equally enabled from
its situation to disturb, either by pyracies or naval arma∣ments,
the commerce and peace of England: And that
if the duke refused Henry's mediation, it proceeded nei∣ther
from an inclination to a war, which he experienced
to be so ruinous to him, nor from a confidence in his
own force, which he knew to be so much inferior to that
of the enemy; but merely from a sense of his present ne∣cessity,
which must engage the King to act the part of
his confederate, not of a mediator.</P>
<P>WHEN this answer was reported to the King, he
abandoned not the system of conduct which he had
formed: He only concluded, that some more time was
requisite to quell the obstinacy of the Bretons and make
them submit to reason. And when he learned, that the
people of Brittany, anxious for their duke's safety, had
formed a tumultuary army of 60,000 men, and had ob∣liged
the French to raise the siege of Nantz, he fortified
himself the more in his opinion, that the court of France
would at last be reduced, by multiplied obstacles and dif∣ficulties,
to abandon the project of reducing Brittany to
subjection. He continued therefore the scheme of ne∣gotiation,
and thereby exposed himself to be deceived by
the artifices of the French ministry; who, still pretend∣ing
pacific intentions, sent lord Bernard Daubigni, a
Scots man of quality, to London, and pressed Henry not
<PB N="360" REF="380"/>
to be discouraged in offering his mediation to the court
of Brittany. The King on his part dispatched another
embassy composed of Urswic, the abbot of Abingdon,
and Sir Richard Tonstal, who carried new proposals for
an amicable accommodation. No effectual succours,
meanwhile, were provided for the distressed Bretons.
The lord Woodville, brother to the Queen dowager, a
man of courage and enterprize, having asked leave to
raise underhand a body of volunteers and transport them
into Brittany, met with a refusal from the King, who
was desirous of preserving the appearance of a strict neu∣trality.
That nobleman, however, still persisted in his
intentions. He went over to the Isle of Wight, of
which he was governor; levied a body of 400 men;
and having at last obtained, as is supposed, the secret per∣mission
of Henry, sailed with them to Brittany. This
enterprize proved fatal to the leader, and brought small
relief to the unhappy duke. The Bretons rashly en∣gaged
in a general action with the French at St. Aubin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th July.</NOTE>
and were totally discomfited. Woodville and all the
English were put to the sword; together with a body of
Bretons, who had been accoutered in the garb of Eng∣lishmen,
in order to strike a greater terror into the
French, to whom the martial prowess of that nation was
always formidable<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Argentré Hist. de Bretagne, liv. xii.</NOTE>. The duke of Orleans, the prince
of Orange, and many other persons of rank were taken
prisoners: And the military force of Brittany was to∣tally
dissipated. The death of the duke, which followed
soon after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th Sep∣tember.</NOTE> threw affairs into still greater confusion, and
seemed to threaten the state with a final subjection.</P>
<P>THO' the King prepared not against these events, so
hurtful to the interest of England, with sufficient vigour
<PB N="361" REF="381"/>
and precaution, he had not altogether overlooked them.
Determined to maintain a pacific conduct, as far as the
situation of affairs would permit, he yet knew the war∣like
disposition of his subjects, and observed, that their
antient and inveterate animosity to France was now re∣vived
by the prospect of this great accession to its power
and grandeur. He resolved therefore to make advantage
of those humours, and to draw some supplies of money
from the people, on pretence of giving assistance to the
duke of Brittany. He had summoned a parliament to
meet at Westminster<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">9th November, 1487.</NOTE>; and he soon persuaded them to
grant him a considerable subsidy<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 579, says that this imposition was a capita∣tion tax; the other historians say it was a tax of two shillings on the pound.</NOTE>. But this supply, tho'
voted by parliament, involved the King in unexpected
difficulties. The counties of Durham and York, al∣ways
discontented with Henry's government, and farther
provoked by the late oppressions, under which they had
laboured, after the suppression of Simnel's rebellion, re∣sisted
the commissioners who were appointed to levy the
new tax.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An insur∣rection in the north.</NOTE> The commissioners, terrified with this ap∣pearance
of sedition, made application to the earl of
Northumberland, and desired of him advice and assistance
in the execution of their office. That nobleman thought
the matter of importance enough to consult the King;
who, unwilling to yield to the humours of a discontented
populace, and foreseeing the pernicious consequences
of such a precedent, renewed his orders for a strict levy
of the imposition. Northumberland summoned toge∣ther
the justices and chief freeholders, and delivered the
King's commands in the most imperious terms, which,
he thought, would inforce obedience, but which tended
only to provoke the people, and make them believe him
<PB N="362" REF="382"/>
the adviser of those orders which he delivered to them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 595.</NOTE>.
They flew to arms, and attacked Northumberland's
house, whom they put to death. Having incurred such
deep guilt, their mutinous humour prompted them to de∣clare
against the King himself; and being instigated by
one John Achamber, a seditious fellow of mean birth, they
chose Sir John Egremond their leader, and prepared
themselves for a vigorous resistance. Henry was not
dismayed with an insurrection so precipitant and ill sup∣ported.
He immediately levied a force which he put un∣der
the command of the earl of Surrey, whom he had
delivered from confinement, and restored to his favour.
His intention was to send down these troops, in order
to check the progress of the rebels; while he himself
should follow with a greater body, which would abso∣lutely
insure success. But Surrey thought himself strong
enough to encounter a raw and unarmed multitude; and
he succeeded in the attempt.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suppressed.</NOTE> The rebels were dissipated;
John Achamber taken prisoner, and afterwards executed
with some of his accomplices; Sir John Egremond fled
to the dutchess of Burgundy, who gave him protection;
the greater number of the rebels received a pardon.</P>
<P>HENRY had probably expected, when he obtained this
grant from the parliament, that he should be able to
terminate the affair of Brittany by negotiation, and that
he might thereby fill his coffers with the money levied
by the imposition. But as the distresses of the Bretons
still multiplied, and became every day more urgent; he
found himself under the necessity of taking some mea∣sures,
in order to support them. On the death of the
duke, the French had revived some antiquated claims to
the dominion of the dutchy; and as the duke of Orleans
was now captive in France, their former pretence for
<PB N="363" REF="383"/>
hostilities could no longer serve as a cover to their am∣bition.
The King resolved therefore to engage as auxi∣liary
to Brittany; and to consult the interest, as well as
desires of the people, by opposing himself to the progress
of the French power. Besides entering into a league
with Maximilian, and another with Ferdinand, which
were distant resources, he levied a body of troops, to the
number of 6000 men, with an intention of transporting
them into Brittany.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1489.</NOTE> Still anxious, however, for the
payment of his expences, he concluded a treaty with the
young dutchess, by which she engaged to deliver into
his hands two sea-port towns, there to remain till she
should entirely refund the charges of the armament<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Du Tilltet, Recueil des Traitez.</NOTE>.
Tho' he engaged for the service of these troops during
the space of eight months only, yet was the dutchess ob∣liged,
by the necessity of her affairs, to submit to such
rigid conditions, imposed by an ally, so much concerned
in interest to protect her.<NOTE PLACE="marg">King sends forces into Brittany.</NOTE> The forces arrived under the
command of lord Willoughby of Broke; and made the
Bretons, during some time, masters of the field. The
French retired into their garrisons; and proposed by di∣latory measures to waste the fire of the English, and dis∣gust them with their enterprize. The scheme was well
laid, and met with success. Lord Broke found such dis∣cord
and confusion in the councils of Brittany, that no
measures could be concerted for any undertaking; no
supply obtained; no provisions, carriages, artillery, or
military stores procured. The whole court was rent
into factions: No one minister had acquired the ascend∣ant:
And whatever project was formed by one, was
sure to be traversed by another. The English, discon∣certed
in every enterprize, by these animosities and un∣certain
councils, returned home as soon as the time of
<PB N="364" REF="384"/>
their service was elapsed; leaving only a small garrison
in those towns which had been put into their hands.
During their stay in Brittany, they had only contri∣buted
still farther to waste the country; and by their de∣parture,
they left it entirely at the mercy of the enemy.
So feeble was the succour, which Henry in this impor∣tant
conjuncture afforded his ally, whom the invasion of
a foreign enemy, concurring with domestic dissensions,
had reduced to the utmost distress!</P>
<P>THE great object of dissension among the Bretons was
the disposal of the young dutchess in marriage. The
mareschal Rieux seconded the suit of the lord Albert,
who led some forces to her assistance. The chancellor
Montauban, observing the aversion of the dutchess to
this suitor, insisted, that a petty prince, such as Albert,
was unable to support Anne in her present extremities;
and he recommended some more powerful alliance, par∣ticularly
that of Maximilian,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1490.</NOTE> King of the Romans.
This party at last prevailed; the marriage with Maxi∣milian
was celebrated by proxy; and the dutchess thence∣forth
assumed the title of Queen of the Romans. But
this magnificent appellation was all she gained by her
marriage. Maximilian, destitute of troops and money,
and embarrassed with the continual revolts of the Flem∣ings,
could give no assistance to his distressed consort:
While Albert, enraged at the preference given his rival,
deserted her cause, and received the French into Nantz,
the most important place in the dutchy, both for strength
and riches.</P>
<P>THE French court began now to change their scheme
with regard to the subjection of Brittany. Charles had
formerly been assianced, to Margaret daughter of Maxi∣milian;
who, tho too young to consummate her mar∣riage,
had been sent to Paris to be educated, and at this
<PB N="365" REF="385"/>
time bore the title of Queen of France. Besides the rich
dowry, which she brought the King, she was, after her
brother, Philip, then in early youth, heiress to all the
dominions of the house of Burgundy; and seemed in
many respects the most proper match, which could be
chosen for the young monarch. These circumstances
had so blinded the councils both of Maximilian and
Henry, that they never suspected any other intentions
in the French court; nor were able to discover, that
engagements, seemingly so advantageous and so solemnly
entered into, could be infringed and set aside. But
Charles began to perceive, that the conquest of Brittany,
in opposition to the natives, and to all the great powers
in Christendom, would prove a very difficult enterprize;
and that even, if he should over-run the country and
make himself master of the fortresses, it would be im∣possible
for him long to retain possession of them. The
marriage alone of the dutchess could fully re-annex
that fief to the crown; and the present and certain enjoyment
of so considerable a territory seemed preferable to the pro∣spect
of inheriting the dominions of the house of Bur∣gundy;
a prospect which became every day more distant
and precarious. Above all, the marriage of Maximilian
and Anne, appeared destructive to the grandeur and even
security of the French monarchy; while that prince,
possessing Flanders on the one hand, and Brittany on the
other, might thus from both quarters make inroads into
the heart of the country. The only remedy for these evils
was therefore concluded to be the dissolution of the two
marriages, which had been celebrated, but not consum∣mated;
and the espousal of the dutchess of Brittany by
the King of France.</P>
<P>IT was requisite that this expedient, which had not
been foreseen by any court of Europe, and which they
<PB N="366" REF="386"/>
were, all of them, so much engaged in point of interest
to oppose, should be kept a profound secret, and should
be discovered to the world only by the full execu∣tion
of it. The measures of the French ministry were in the
conduct of this delicate enterprize very wise and political.
While they pressed Brittany with all the rigours of war,
they secretly gained the count of Dunois, who possessed
great authority with the Bretons; and having also en∣gaged
in their interests the prince of Orange, cousin∣german
to the dutchess, they gave him his liberty, and
sent him into Brittany. These persons, supported by other
emissaries of France, prepared the minds of men
for the great revolution projected, and displayed, tho'
still with many precautions, all the advantages of an
union with the French monarchy. They represented to
the barons of Brittany, that their country, harrassed
during so many years with perpetual war, had need of
some repose, and of a solid and lastding peace with the
only power that was formidable to them: That their
alliance with Maximilian was not able to afford them
even present protection; and by uniting them closely
with a power, which was rival to the greatness of France,
fixed the in perpetual enmity with that powerful mo∣narchy:
That their near neighbourhood exposed them
first to the inroads of the enemy; and the happiest event,
which in such a situation could befal them, would be to
attain to peace, tho' by a final subjection to France, and
by the loss of that liberty, transmitted to them from their
ancestors: And that any other expedients, compatible
with the honour of the state, and their duty to their so∣vereign,
was preferable to a scene of such disorder and
devastation.</P>
<P>THESE suggestions had influence on the Bretons: But
the chief difficulty lay in surmounting the prejudices of
the young dutchess herself. That princess had imbibed a
<PB N="367" REF="387"/>
strong prejudice against the French nation, and particu∣larly
against Charles, who had been the author of all the
calamities, which, from her earliest infancy, had beffallen
her family. She had also fixed her affections on Maxi∣milian;
and as she now deemed him her husband, she
could not, she thought, without incurring the greatest
guilt, and violating the most solemn engagements, con∣tract
a marriage with another person. In order to over∣come
her obstinacy, Charles gave the duke of Orelans
his liberty, who, tho' formerly a suitor to the dutchess,
was now contented to ingratiate himself with the King,
by employing in his favour all the interest which he still
possessed in Britanny. The mareschal Rieux and chan∣cellor
Montauban were reconciled by his negotiations;
and these rival ministers now concurred with the prince
of Orange, and the count of Dunois, in pressing the
conclusion of a marriage with Charles. By their sug∣gestion,
Charles advanced with a powerful army and in∣vested
Rennes, at that time the residence of the dutchess;
who, assailed on all hands, and finding none to support
her in her inflexibility, at last opened the gates of the
city, and agreed to espouse the King of France. She
was married at Langey in Touraine;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annex∣tion of Brittany to France.</NOTE> conducted to St.
Denis, where she was crowned; and thence made her
entry into Paris, amidst the joyful acclamations of the
people, who regarded this marriage as the most prosper∣ous
event that could have befallen their monarchy.</P>
<P>THE triumph and success of Charles was the most
sensible mortification to the King of the Romans. He
had lost a considerable territory, which he thought he had
acquired, and an accomplished princess whom he had
espoused; he was affronted in the person of his daughter
margaret, who was sent back to him, after she had been
treated during some years as Queen of France; he had
<PB N="366" REF="388"/>

<PB N="367" REF="389"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="368" REF="390"/>
reason to reproach himself with his own supine security,
in neglecting the consummation of his marriage, which
was easily practicable for him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1491.</NOTE> and which would have
rendered the tye indissoluble: These considerations threw
him into the most violent rage, which he vented in very
indecent expressions; and he threatened France with an
invasion from the united arms of Austria, Spain and
England.</P>
<P>THE King of England had also just reason to reproach
himself with misconduct in this important transaction;
and tho' the affair had terminated in a manner which he
could not precisely foresee, his negligence, in leaving his
most useful ally so long exposed to the invasion of su∣perior
power, could not but appear on reflection the re∣sult
of timid caution and narrow politics. As he va∣lued
himself very much on his extensive forefight and
profound judgment, the ascendant acquired over him, by
a raw youth, such as Charles, could not but give him
the highest displeasure, and prompt him to seek vengeance,
after all remedy for his miscarriage was become absolutely
impracticable. But he was farther actuated by avarice,
a motive still more predominant with him than either
pride or revenge; and he sought even from his present
disappointments, the gratification of this ruling passion.
On pretence of a French war, he issued a commission for
levying a <HI>Benevolence</HI> on his people<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xii. p. 446. Bacon says that the benevolence was levied with consent of parliament, which is a mistake.</NOTE>; an arbitrary tax∣ation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th July.</NOTE>
which had been abolished by a recent law of
Richard the third, and which was the more provoking,
because, tho' really raised by menaces and extortion, it
was nevertheless pretended to be given by the voluntary
consent of the people. This violence fell chiefly on the
commercial part of the nation, who were possessed of
<PB N="369" REF="391"/>
the ready money. London alone contributed to the
amount of near 10,000 pounds. Archbishop Morton,
the chancellor, instructed the commissioners to employ a
dilemma, in which every one might be comprehended:
If the persons applied to live frugally, they were told,
that their parsimony must necessarily have enriched them:
If their method of living was splendid and hospitable,
they were concluded opulent on account of their ex∣pences.
This device was by some called chancellor
Morton's fork, and by others his crutch.</P>
<P>SO little apprehensive was the King of a parliament,
on account of his levying this arbitrary imposition, that
he soon after summoned that assembly to meet at West∣minster;<NOTE PLACE="marg">27th Octo∣ber.</NOTE>
and he even expected to enrich himself farther
by working on their passions and prejudices. He knew
the resentment, which the English had conceived against
France, on account of the conquest of Brittany; and
he took care to insist on that topic,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A parlia∣ment.</NOTE> in the speech, which
he himself pronounced to the parliament. He told them,
that France, elevated with her late successes, had even
proceeded to a contempt of England, and had refused to
pay the tribute, which Lewis the eleventh had stipulated
to Edward the fourth: That it become so warlike a na∣tion
as the English to be rouzed by this indignity, and
not to limit their pretensions merely to repressing the
present injury: That for his part, he was determined to
lay claim to the crown of France itself, and to maintain
by force of arms so just a title transmitted to him by his
gallant ancestors: That Crecy, Poictiers, and Azincourt
were sufficient to instruct them in their superiority over
the enemy; nor did he despair of adding new names to
the glorious catalogue: That a King of France had
been prisoner at London, and a King of England had
been crowned at Paris; events which should animate
<PB N="370" REF="392"/>
them to an emulation of like glory with that enjoyed by
their forefathers: That the domestic dissensions of Eng∣land
had been the sole cause of her losing these foreign
dominions; and her present union and harmony would
be the effectual means of recovering them: That where
such lasting honour was in view, and such an important
acquisition, it became not brave men to repine at the
advance of a little treasure: And that for his part, he
was determined to make the war maintain itself, and
hoped, by the invasion of so opulent a kingdom as France,
to encrease, rather than diminish, the riches of the na∣tion<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Eacon, p. 602.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING these magnificent vaunts of the
King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1492.</NOTE> all men of penetration concluded, from the per∣sonal
character of the man, and still more, from the situa∣tion
of his affairs, that he had no serious intention of
pushing the war to such extremity as he pretended.
France was not now in the same condition as when such
successful inroads had been made into her by the former
Kings of England. The great fiefs were united to the
crown; the princes of the blood were desirous of peace
and tranquility; the kingdom abounded with able cap∣tains
and veteran soldiers; and the general aspect of its
affairs seemed rather to threaten its neighbours, than to
promise them any considerable advantages against it. The
levity and vain-glory of Maximilian were supported by
his pompous titles; but were ill seconded by military
power, and still less, by any revenue, proportioned to
them. The politic Ferdinand, while he made a show of
war, was actually negotiating for peace; and rather than
expose himself to any hazard, would accept of very mo∣derate
concessions from France. Even England was not
<PB N="371" REF="393"/>
free from domestic discontents; and in Scotland, the
death of Henry's friend and ally, James the third, who
had been murdered by his rebellious subjects, had made
way for the succession of his son, James the fourth, who
was devoted to the French interest, and would surely be
alarmed at any progress of the English arms. But all
these obvious considerations had no influence with the
parliament. Inflamed by the ideas of subduing France,
and of inriching themselves with the spoils of that king∣dom,
they gave into the snare prepared for them, and
voted the supply which the King demanded. Two fif∣teenths
were granted him; and the better to enable his
vassals and nobility to attend him, an act was passed,
empowering them to sell their estates, without paying
any fines for alienation.</P>
<P>THE nobility were universally seized with a desire of
military glory; and having credulously swallowed all the
boasts of the King, they dreamed of no less than carry∣ing
their triumphant arms to the gates of Paris, and put∣ting
the crown of France on Henry's head. Many of
them borrowed large sums or sold off manors, that they
might appear in the field with greater splendour, and lead
out their followers in more compleat order. The King
crossed the seas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France.</NOTE> and arrived at Calais on the sixth of
October, with an army of twenty-five thousand foot
and sixteen hundred horse, which he put under the com∣mand
of the duke of Bedford and the earl of Oxford:
But as some inferred, from his opening the campaign in
so late a season, that peace would soon be concluded be∣tween
the crowns, he was desirous of suggesting a con∣trary
inference. “He had come over,” he said, “to
make an entire conquest of France, which was not
the work of one summer. It was therefore of no
consequence at what season he began the invasion;
<PB N="372" REF="394" MS="y"/>
especially as he had Calais ready for winter quarters.”
As if he had seriously intended this enterprize, he in∣stantly
marched with his army into the enemy's country
and laid siege to Bulloigne:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasion of France.</NOTE> But notwithstanding this ap∣pearance
of a hostile disposition, there had been secret
advances made towards a peace above three months be∣fore;
and commissioners had been appointed to treat of
the terms. The better to reconcile the minds of men to
this unexpected measure, the King's ambassadors arrived
in the camp from the Low Countries, and informed him,
that Maximilian was in no readiness to join him; nor
was any assistance to be hoped for from that quarter.
Soon after, messengers came from Spain, and brought
news of a peace concluded between that kingdom and
France, in which Charles had made a cession of the coun∣ties
of Roussillon and Cerdagne to Ferdinand. Tho'
these articles of intelligence were carefully dispersed thro'
the army, the King was still apprehensive, lest a sudden
peace, after such magnificent promises and high expect∣ations,
might expose him to great reproach. In order
the more effectually to cover the intended measures, he
secretly engaged the marquiss of Dorset, together with
twenty three persons of condition, to present him a pe∣tition
for his agreeing to a treaty with France. The pre∣tence
was founded on the late season of the year, the
difficulty of supplying the army at Calais during winter,
the obstacles which arose in the siege of Bulloigne, the
desertion of those allies whose assistance had been most
relied on: Events which might, all of them, have been
foreseen before the embarkation of the troops.</P>
<P>IN consequence of these preparatory steps, the bishop
of Exeter and the lord Daubeney were sent to conser at
Estaples with the mareschal de Cordes, and to put the last
hand to the treaty. A few days sufficed for this purpose:
<PB N="373" REF="395"/>
The demands of Henry were wholly pecuniary; and the
King of France, who deemed the peaceable possession of
Brittany an equivalent for any money, and who was all
on fire for his projected expedition into Italy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d of No∣vember. Peace with France.</NOTE> readily
agreed to the proposals made him. He engaged to pay
Henry seven hundred and forty-five thousand crowns,
about one hundred and eighty-six thousand pounds ster∣ling;
partly as a reimbursement of the sums advanced
for Brittany, partly as arrears of the pension due to Ed∣ward
the fourth. And he stipulated a yearly pension to
Henry and his heirs of twenty-five thousand crowns.
Thus the King, as remarked by his historian, made profit
upon his subjects for the war; and upon his enemies for
the peace<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 605. Pol. Virg. p. 586.</NOTE>. And the people agreed, that he had fulfilled
his promise, when he said to the parliament, that he
would make the war maintain itself. Maximilian, was
comprehended in Henry's treaty, if he pleased to accept
of it; but he disdained to be in any respect beholden to
an ally, of whom, he thought, he had reason to com∣plain:
He made a separate peace with France, and ob∣tained
restitution of Artois, Franchecomte and Charolois,
which had been given as the dowry of his daughter,
when she was affianced to the King of France.</P>
<P>THE peace, concluded between England and France,
was the more likely to continue, because Charles, full
of ambition and youthful hopes, bent all his attention to
the side of Italy, and soon after undertook the conquest
of Naples; an enterprize, which Henry regarded with
the greater indifference, as Naples lay remote from him,
and France had never, in any age, been successful on
that quarter. The King's authority was fully established
at home; and every rebellion, which had been attempted
<PB N="374" REF="396"/>
against him, had hitherto tended only to confound his
enemies, and consolidate his power and influence. His
reputation for policy and conduct was every day agument∣ing;
his treasures had encreased even from the most
unprosperous events; the hopes of all pretenders to his
throne were cut off, as well by his marriage, as by the
issue which it had brought him. In this promising situ∣ation,
the King had reason to flatter himself with the
prospect of a durable peace and tranquility: But his in∣veterate
and indefatigable enemies, whom he had wan∣tonly
provoked, raised him up an adversary, who kept
him long in inquietude, and sometimes even brought him
into danger.</P>
<P>THE dutchess of Burgundy, full of resentment for the
depression of her family and its partizans, rather irritated
than discouraged by the ill success of her past enterprizes,
was determined at least to disturb that government, which
she found it so difficult to subvert. By means of her
emissaries, she propagated the report, that her nephew,
Richard Plantagenet, duke of York, had escaped from
the Tower when his elder brother was murdered, and
that he lay still somewhere concealed: And finding this
rumour, however improbable, to be greedily received by
the people, she had been looking out for some young
man, proper to personate that unfortunate prince.</P>
<P>THERE was one Osbec or Warbec, a renegado Jew
of Tournay, who had been carried by some business to
London in the reign of Edward the fourth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Perkin Warbec.</NOTE> and had there
a son born to him. Having had opportunities of being
known to the King, and obtaining his favour, he pre∣vailed
with that prince, whose manners were very affable,
to stand godfather to his son, to whom he gave the name
of Peter, corrupted after the Flemish manner, into Peter∣kin,
or Perkin. It was by some believed, that Edward,
<PB N="375" REF="397"/>
among his other amorous adventures, had had a secret
correspondence with Warbec's wife, and from this in∣cident
people accounted for that resemblance, which was
afterwards remarked between young Perkin and that mo∣narch<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 606.</NOTE>. Some years after the birth of this child, War∣bec
returned to Tournay; where Perkin his son remained
not long, but by different accidents was carried from
place to place, and his birth and fortunes became there∣by
unknown, and difficult to be traced by the most di∣ligent
enquiry. The variety of his adventures had hap∣pily
favoured the natural versatility and sagacity of his
genius; and he seemed to be a youth perfectly fitted to
act any part, or assume any character. In this light he
had been represented to the dutchess of Burgundy, who,
struck with the concurrence of so many circumstances
suited to her purpose, desired to be made acquainted with
the man, on whom she began already to ground her
hopes of success. She found him to exceed her most
sanguine expectations;<NOTE PLACE="marg">His im∣posture.</NOTE> so beautiful did he appear in his
person, so graceful in his air, so courtly in his address, so
full of docility and good sense in his behaviour and con∣versation.
The lessons, which were necessary to be
taught him, in order to his personating the duke of York,
were soon learned by a youth of such quick apprehension;
but as the season seemed not then favourable for his en∣terprize,
Margaret, in order the better to conceal him,
sent him, under the care of Lady Brampton, into Portu∣gal,
where he remained a year, unknown to all the world.</P>
<P>THE war, which was then ready to break out between
France and England, seemed to afford a proper oppor∣tunity
for the discovery of this new phaenomenon; and
Ireland, which still retained its attachments to the house
<PB N="376" REF="398"/>
of York, was pitched on as the proper place for his first
appearance<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Polyd. Virg. p. 589.</NOTE>. He landed at Corke; and immediately
assuming the name of Richard Plantagenet, drew to him
partizans among that ignorant and credulous people. He
wrote letters to the earls of Desmond and Kildare, in∣viting
them to join his party: He dispersed every where
the strange intelligence of his escape from his uncle
Richard's cruelty; and men, fond of every thing new
and wonderful, began to make him the general subject of
their discourse, and even the object of their favour.</P>
<P>THE news soon reached France; and Charles, prompt∣ed
by the private sollicitations of the dutchess of Bur∣gundy,
and the intrigues of one Frion, a secretary of
Henry, who had deserted his service, sent Perkin an in∣vitation
to repair to him at Paris. He received him with
all the marks of regard due to the duke of York; settled
on him a handsome pension, assigned him magnificent
lodgings, and in order to provide at once for his dignity
and security, gave him a guard for his person, of which
lord Congresall accepted the office of captain. The
French courtiers readily embraced a fiction, which their
sovereign thought it his interest to adopt: Perkin, both
by his deportment and person, supported the prepossession,
which was spread abroad of his royal pedigree: And
the whole kingdom was full of the accomplishments as
well as singular adventures and misfortunes, of the young
Plantagenet. Wonders of this nature are commonly
augmented at a distance. From France, the admiration
and credulity diffused themselves into England: Sir
George Neville, Sir John Taylor, and above a hundred
gentlemen more came to Paris, in order to offer their ser∣vice
to the supposed duke of York, and to share his
<PB N="377" REF="399"/>
fortunes: And the impostor had now the appearance of
a court attending him, and began to entertain hopes of
final success in his undertakings.</P>
<P>WHEN peace was concluded between France and Eng∣land
at Estaples, Henry applied to have Perkin put into
his hands; but Charles, resolute not to betray a young
man, of whatever birth, whom he had invited into his
kingdom, would agree only to dismiss him. The pre∣tended
Plantagenet retired to the dutchess of Burgundy
in Flanders, and craving her protection and assistance,
offered to lay before her all the proofs of that birth, to
which he laid claim.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is a∣vowed
by the dutch∣ess of Bur∣gundy.</NOTE> The princess affected ignorance
of his pretensions; even put on the appearance of distrust;
and having, as she said, been already deceived by Sim∣nel's
claim, she was determined never again to be se∣duced
by any impostor. She desired before all the world
to be instructed in his reasons for assuming the name
which he bore; seemed to examine every circumstance
with the most scrupulous nicety; put many particular
questions to him; affected astonishment at his answers;
and at last, after long and severe scrutiny, burst out in∣to
joy and admiration at his wonderful delivery, em∣braced
him as her nephew, the true image of Edward,
the sole heir of the Plantagenets, and the legitimate
successor of the English throne.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1493.</NOTE> She immediately as∣signed
him an equipage, suited to his pretended
birth; appointed him a guard of thirty halberdiers;
engaged every one to pay court to him; and on all
occasions honoured him with the appellation of the
<HI>White Rose of England.</HI> The Flemings, moved by
the authority, which Margaret, both from her rank
and personal character, enjoyed among them, readily
adopted the fiction of Perkin's royal descent: No sur∣mize
<PB N="378" REF="400"/>
of his true birth was as yet heard of: Little con∣tradiction
was made to the prevailing opinion: And the
English, from their great communication with the na∣tives
of the Low Countries, were every day more and
more prepossessed in favour of the impostor.</P>
<P>IT was not the populace alone of England, that gave
credit to Perkin's pretensions. Men of the highest birth
and quality, disgusted with Henry's government, by
which they found the nobility depressed, began to turn
their eyes towards this new claimant, and some of them
even entered into a correspondence with him. Lord
Fitzwater,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and by ma∣ny of the English no∣bility.</NOTE> Sir Simon Mountfort, Sir Thomas Thwaites
betrayed their inclination towards him: Sir William
Stanley himself, lord chamberlain, who had been so
active in raising Henry to the throne, moved either by
blind credulity or a restless ambition, entertained the
project of a revolt in favour of his enemy<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 608.</NOTE>. Sir Ro∣bert
Clifford and William Barley were still more open
in their measures: They went over to Flanders, offered
their service to Perkin, and were introduced by the dut∣chess
of Burgundy to his acquaintance. Clifford wrote
back to England, that he knew perfectly the person of
Richard duke of York, that this young man was un∣doubtedly
that prince himself, and that no circumstance
of his story was exposed to the least difficulty. Such
positive intelligence, conveyed by a person of such high
rank and character, was sufficient with many to put
the matter beyond all question, and excited the wonder
and attention even of the most indifferent. The whole
nation was held in suspence; a regular conspiracy was
formed against the King's authority; and a correspon∣dence
settled between the malecontents in Flanders and
those in England.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="401"/>
THE King was well informed of all these particu∣lars;
but agreeable to his character, which was both
cautious and resolute, he proceeded very deliberately,
but steadily, in counter-working the projects of his ene∣mies.
His first object was to ascertain the death of the
real duke of York, and to confirm the opinion, which
had always prevailed with regard to that event. Five
persons had been employed by Richard in the murder
of his nephews; Sir James Tirrel, to whom he had
committed the government of the Tower for that pur∣pose,
and who had seen the dead princes; Forrest, Digh∣ton,
and Slater, who perpetrated the action; and the
priest who buried the bodies. Tirrel and Dighton alone
were alive, and they agreed in the same story; but as
the priest was dead, and as the bodies had been re∣moved
by Richard's orders from the place where they
were first interred, and could not now be found, it was
not in Henry's power to put the fact, so much as he
wished, beyond all doubt and controversy.</P>
<P>HE met at first with more difficulty, but was in the
end more successful, in detecting who this wonderful
person was that thus boldly advanced pretensions to his
crown. He dispersed his spies all over Flanders and
England; he engaged many to pretend that they had
embraced Perkin's party; he directed them to insi∣nuate
themselves into the confidence of his friends; in
proportion as they conveyed intelligence of any conspi∣rator,
he bribed his retainers, his domestic servants, nay
sometimes his confessor, and by these means traced up
some other confederate; Clifford himself he engaged by
hopes of reward and pardon, to betray the secrets com∣mitted
to him; the more trust he gave any of his spies,
the higher resentment did he feign against them; some
of them he even caused to be excommunicated and pub∣licly
<PB N="380" REF="402"/>
anathematized, in order the better to procure them
the confidence of his enemies: And in the issue, the
whole plan of the conspiracy was laid clearly before him;
and the pedigree, adventures, life and conversation of
the pretended duke of York. This latter part of the
story was immediately published for the satisfaction of
the nation: The conspirators he reserved for a slower
and more secure vengeance.</P>
<P>MEAN WHILE, he remonstrated with the archduke
Philip,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1494.</NOTE> on account of the countenance and protection,
which was afforded in his dominions to so infamous an
imposture; contrary to treaties subsisting between the
sovereigns, and to the mutual amity, which had so
long been maintained by the subjects of both states.
Margaret had interest enough to get his applications
rejected; on pretence that Philip had no authority
over the demesnes of the dutchess dowager. And
the King, in resentment of this injury, cut off all
commerce with the Low Countries, banished the Fle∣mings
from England, and recalled his own subjects
from these provinces. Philip retaliated by like edicts;
but Henry knew, that so mutinous a people as the Flem∣ings
would not long bear, in compliance with the hu∣mours
of their prince, to be deprived of so beneficial a
branch of commerce as that which they carried on with
England.</P>
<P>HE had it in his power to inflict more effectual pu∣nishment
on his domestic enemies; and when his pro∣jects
were sufficiently matured, he failed not to make
them feel the effects of his resentment. Almost in the
same instant, he arrested Fitzwater, Mountfort, and
Thwaites, together with William Daubeney, Robert
Ratcliff, Thomas Cressenor, and Thomas Astwood.
<PB N="381" REF="403"/>
All these were arraigned, convicted, and condemned for
high treason, in adhering and promising aid to Perkin.
Mountfort, Ratcliff, and Daubeney were immediately
executed: Fitzwater was sent over to Calais, and re∣tained
in custody; but having practised on his keeper
for an escape, he soon after underwent the same fate.
The rest were pardoned, together with William Worse∣ley,
dean of St. Paul's, and some others, who had been
accused and examined, but not brought to public trial<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 592.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>GREATER and more solemn preparations were deem∣ed
requisite for the trial of Stanley, lord chamberlain,
whose authority in the nation, whose domestic connex∣ions
with the King, as well as his former great services,
seemed to secure him against any accusation or pu∣nishment.
Clifford was directed to come over privately
to England, and to throw himself at the King's feet,
while placed at the council-table; craving pardon for
his past offences, and offering to atone for them by any
services, which should be required of him. Henry told
him, that the best proof he could give of penitence, and
the only service he could now render him, was the full
confession of his guilt, and the discovery of all his
ac∣complices,
however distinguished by rank or character.
Encouraged by this exhortation, Clifford accused Stan∣ley
then present, as his chief abettor; and offered to lay
before the council the whole proof of his guilt. Stanley
himself could not discover more surprize than was affected
by Henry on this occasion. He received the intelligence
as absolutely false and incredible; that a man, to whom
he was in a great measure beholden for his crown, and
even for his life; a man, to whom, by every honour
and favour, he had endeavoured to express his gratitude;
<PB N="382" REF="404"/>
whose brother, the earl of Derby, was the King's father-in-law;
to whom he had even committed the trust of his per∣son,
by creating him lord chamberlain: That this man,
enjoying his full confidence and affection, not actuated
by any motive of discontent or apprehension, should en∣gage
in a conspiracy against him. Clifford was there∣fore
exhorted to weigh well the consequences of this
accusation; but as he persisted in the same positive asse∣verations,
Stanley was committed to custody, and was
soon after examined before the council<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 611. Polyd. Virg. p. 593.</NOTE>. He denied not
the guilt imputed to him by Clifford; he did not even
endeavour much to extenuate it; whether he thought
that a frank and open confession would serve for an
atonement, or trusted to his present connexions, and his
former services,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and execution of Stanley.</NOTE> for pardon and security. But princes
are often apt to regard great services as a ground of
jealousy, especially if accompanied with a craving and
restless disposition, in the person who has performed
them. The general discontent also, and mutinous hu∣mour
of the people, seemed to require some great example
of severity. And as Stanley was one of the most opulent
subjects in the kingdom, being possessed of above three
thousand pounds a year in land, and forty thousand marks
in plate and money,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1495.</NOTE> besides other property of great va∣lue,
the prospect of so rich a forfeiture was deemed no
small motive in Henry for proceeding to extremity
against him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th Feb.</NOTE> After six weeks delay, which was inter∣posed
in order to shew that the King was restrained by
doubts and scruples; he was brought to his trial, con∣demned,
and presently after beheaded. Historians are
not well agreed with regard to the crime which was proved against him. The general report is, that he
<PB N="383" REF="405"/>
should have said in confidence to Clifford, that, if he
was sure the young man, who appeared in Flanders,
was really son to King Edward, he never would bear
arms against him. This sentiment might disgust Henry
as implying a preference of the house of York to that of
Lancaster, but could scarcely be the ground, even in
those arbitrary times, of a sentence of high treason against
Stanley. It is more probable, therefore, as is asserted
by some historians, that he had expressly engaged to as∣sist
Perkin, and had actually sent him some supply of
money.</P>
<P>THE fate of Stanley made great impression on the
whole kingdom, and struck all Perkin's retainers with
the deepest dismay. From Clifford's desertion, they found
that all their secrets were discovered; and as it appeared,
that Stanley, while he seemed to live in the greatest
confidence with the King, had been continually sur∣rounded
by spies, who reported and registered every ac∣tion
which he committed, nay, every word which fell
from him, a general distrust took place, and all mutual
confidence was destroyed, even among the most intimate
friends and acquaintance. The jealous and severe tem∣per
of the King, together with his great reputation for
sagacity and penetration, kept men in awe, and quelled
not only the movements of sedition, but the very mur∣murs
of faction. Libels, however, crept out against
Henry's person and administration; and being greedily
propagated, by every secret art, showed that there still
remained among the people a considerable root of dis∣content,
which wanted only a proper opportunity to dis∣cover
itself.</P>
<P>BUT Henry continued more intent on increasing the
terrors of his people, that on gaining their affections.
Trusting to the great success which attended him in
<PB N="384" REF="406"/>
all his enterprizes, he gave every day, more and more,
a loose to his rapacious temper, and employed the arts
of perverted law and justice, in order to exact fines and
compositions from his people. Sir William Capel, al∣derman
of London, was comdemned on some penal sta∣tutes
to pay the sum of 2743 pounds, and was obliged to
compound for sixteen hundred and fifteen. This was the
first noted case of that nature; but it became a precedent,
which prepared the way for many others. The manage∣ment,
indeed, of these oppressive arts was the great secret
of the King's administration. While he depressed the
nobility, he exalted and honoured and caressed the law∣yers;
and by that means both bestowed authority on the
laws, and was enabled, whenever he pleased, to pervert
them to his own advantage. His government was op∣pressive;
but it was so much the less burthensome, as, by
extending his own authority, and curbing the nobles,
he became in reality the sole oppressor in his king∣dom.</P>
<P>As Perkin found, that the King's authority gained
ground daily among the people, and that his own pre∣tensions
were becoming obsolete, he resolved to attempt
something, which might revive the hopes and expectations
of his partizans. Having gathered together a band of
outlaws, pirates, robbers, and necessitous persons of all
nations, to the number of 600 men, he put to sea with
a resolution of making a descent in England; and of ex∣citing
the common people to arms, since all his cor∣respondence
with the nobility was cut off by Henry's
vigilance and severity. Information being brought him,
that the King had made a progress to the north, he cast
anchor on the coast of Kent, and sent some of his re∣tainers
ashore, who invited the country to join him.
The gentlemen of Kent gathered together some troops
<PB N="385" REF="407"/>
to oppose him; but they proposed to do more essential
service than by repelling the invasion: They carried
the semblance of friendship to Perkin, and invited him
to come himself ashore, in order to take the command
over them. But the wary youth, observing that they
had more order and regularity in their movements than
could be supposed in new levied forces, who had taken
arms against established authority, refused to commit
himself into their hands; and the Kentish troops despair∣ing
of success in their stratagem, set upon such of his
retainers, as were already landed; and besides some who
were slain and some who escaped, they took an hundred
and fifty prisoners. These were tried and condemned;
and all of them executed, by order from the King, who
was resolved to use no mixture of lenity towards men of
such desperate fortunes<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 595.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS year a Parliament was summoned in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE>
and another in Ireland; and some remarkable laws were
passed in both countries. The English Parliament en∣acted,
that no person who should by arms or otherwise
assist the King for the time being, should ever afterwards,
either by course of law or act of Parliament, be attainted
for such an instance of obedience. This statute might
be exposed to some blame, as favourable to usurpers;
were there any precise rules, which always, even during
the most factious times, could determine the true suc∣cessor,
and render every one inexcusable, who did not
submit to him. But as the titles of princes are then the
great subject of dispute, and each party pleads topics
in their own favour, it seems but equitable to secure
those who act in support of public tranquillity, an object
at all times of undoubted benefit and importance. Hen∣ry,
conscious of his disputed title, promoted this law in
<PB N="386" REF="408"/>
order to secure his partizans against all events; but as
he had himself observed a different practice with regad
to Richard's adherents, he had reason to apprehend, that,
during the violence which usually ensues on public con∣vulsions,
his example, rather than his law, would, in
case of a new revolution, be followed by his enemies.
And the attempt to bind the legislature itself, by pre∣scribing
rules to future Parliaments, was plainly contra∣dictory
to the fundamental principles of political govern∣ment.</P>
<P>THIS Parliament also passed an act, impowering the
King to levy, by course of law, all the sums which any
person had agreed to pay by way of benevolence: A
statute, by which that arbitrary method of taxation was
indirectly authorized and justified.</P>
<P>THE King's authority appeared equally prevalent and
uncontrolable in Ireland. Sir Edward Poynings had
been sent over with some troops into that country, with
an intention of quelling the partizans of the house of
York, and of reducing the natives to subjection. He
was not supported with forces sufficient for that important
enterprize: The Irish, by flying into their woods, and
morasses, and mountains, in some measure, eluded his
efforts: But Poynings summoned a parliament at Dub∣lin,
where he was more successful. He passed that me∣morable
statute, which still bears his name, and which
establishes the authority of the English government in
Ireland. By this statute, all the former laws of Eng∣land
were made to be of force in Ireland; and no bill
can be introduced into the Irish parliament, unless it
previously receive the sanction of the council of England.
This latter laws seems calculated for ensuring the domi∣nion
of the English over Ireland; but was really grant∣ed
at the desire of the Irish Commons, who proposed,
<PB N="387" REF="409" MS="y"/>
by that means, to secure themselves from the tyranny of
their lords, particularly of such lieutenants as were of
Irish birth<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Sir John Davis, p. 235.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE Henry's authority was thus established
throughout his dominions, and general tranquillity pre∣vailed,
the whole continent was thrown into combustion
by the French invasion of Italy, and by the rapid success
which attended Charles in that rash and ill-concerted
enterprize. The Italians, who had entirely lost the use
of arms, and who, in the midst of continual wars, had
become every day more unwarlike, were astonished to
meet with an enemy, that made the field of battle, not
a pompous tournament, but a scene of blood, and sought
at the hazard of their own lives the death of their ene∣my.
Their esseminate troops were dissipated every where
on the approach of the French army: Their best forti∣fied
cities opened their gates: Kingdoms and states
were in an instant overturned: And thro' the whole
length of Italy, which the French penetrated without
resistance, they seemed rather to be taking quarters in
their own country, than making conquests over an ene∣my.
The maxims, which the Italians, during that
age, followed in negotiations, were as ill calculated to
support their states, as the habits to which they were ad∣dicted
in war. A treacherous, deceitful, and inconslant
system of politics prevailed; and even those small remains
of fidelity and honour, which were preserved in the
councils of the other European princes, were ridiculed
in Italy, as proofs of ignorance and rusticity. Ludovico,
duke of Milan, who invited the French to invade Naples,
had never desired nor expected their success; and was
the first alarmed at the prosperous issue of those projects,
which he himself had concerted. By his intrigues a
<PB N="388" REF="410"/>
league was formed among several potentates to oppose
the progress of Charles's conquests and secure their own
independency. This league was composed of Ludovico
himself, the pope, Maximilian King of the Romans,
Ferdinand of Spain, and the republic of Venice. Henry
too entered into the confederacy; but was not put to
any expence or trouble in consequence of his engage∣ments.
The King of France, terrified by so powerful
a combination, retired from Naples with the greatest
part of his army, and returned to France. The forces,
which he left in his new conquests, partly by the revolt
of the inhabitants, partly by the invasion of the Spa∣niards,
were soon after subdued; and the whole king∣dom
of Naples suddenly returned to its allegiance under
Ferdinand, son to Alphonso, who had been suddenly
expelled by the irruption of the French. Ferdinand
died soon after; and left his uncle, Frederic, in peace∣able
possession of the throne.</P>

<P>AFTER Perkin was repulsed from the coast of Kent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXVI.</NOTE>
he retired into Flanders; but as he found it im∣possible
to find subsistance for himself and his followers,
while he remained in tranquillity, he soon after made an
attempt upon Ireland, which had always appeared for∣ward
to join every invader of Henry's authority. But
Poynings had now put the affairs of that island in so good
a posture, that Perkin met with little success; and being
tired of savage life, which he was obliged to lead,
while skulking among the wild Irish, he bent his course
towards Scotland, and presented himself to James the
fourth, who then governed that kingdom. He had been
previously recommended to that prince by the King of
France, who was disgusted at Henry for entering into
the league against him; and this recommendation was
even seconded by Maximilian, who, tho' one of the con∣federates,
stood on ill terms with the King, on account
<PB N="390" REF="412"/>
of his prohibition of commerce with the Low Countries.
The countenance given to Perkin by these princes pro∣cured
him a favourable reception with the King of Scot∣land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Perkin retires to Scotland.</NOTE> who assured him, that, whatever he were, he ne∣ver
should repent the putting himself into his hands<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 615. Polydore Virigil, p. 596, 597.</NOTE>:
The insinuating address and plausible behaviour of the
youth himself seem even to have gained him credit and
authority. James, whom years had not yet taught dis∣trust
and caution, was seduced to believe the story of
Perkin's birth and adventures; and he carried his con∣fidence
so far as to give him in marriage the lady Cathe∣rine
Gordon, daughter of the earl of Huntley, and a
near kinswoman of his own; a young lady too, eminent
for virtue as well as beauty.</P>
<P>THERE subsisted at that time a great jealousy between
the courts of England and Scotland;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1496.</NOTE> and James was
probably the more forward on that account to adopt any
fiction, which, he thought, might reduce his enemy to
distress or difficulty. He suddenly resolved to make an
inroad into England, attended with some of the border∣ers;
and he carried Perkin along with him, in hopes,
that the appearance of the pretended prince might raise
an insurrection in the northern counties. Perkin himself
disperst a manifesto, in which he set forth his own story,
and craved the assistance of all his subjects in expelling
the usurper, whose tyranny and mal-administration,
whose depression of the nobility by the elevation of mean
persons, whose oppression of the people by multiplied im∣positions
and vexations, had justly, he said, rendered
him odious to all men. But Perkin's pretensions, at∣tended
by repeated disappointments, were now become
stale in the eyes even of the populace; and the hostile
<PB N="391" REF="413"/>
dispositions, which subsisted between the kingdoms, ren∣dered
a prince, supported by the Scots, but an unwelcome
present to the English nation. The ravages also, com∣mitted
by the borderers, accustomed to licence and dis∣order,
struck a terror into all men; and made the people
prepare rather for repelling the invaders than for joining
them. Perkin, that he might support his pretensions to
royal birth, feigned great compassion for the misery of
his plundered subjects; and publicly remonstrated with his
only against the depredations exercised by the Scots army<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 598.</NOTE>:
But James told him, that he doubted his concern was
only employed in behalf of his enemy, and that he was
anxious to preserve what never should belong to him.
That prince now began to perceive, that his attempt
would be fruitless; and hearing of an army, which was
on its march to attack him, he thought proper to retreat
into his own country.</P>
<P>THE King discovered little anxiety to procure either
reparation or vengeance for this insult committed on him
by the Scots nation: His chief concern was to draw ad∣vantage
from it, by the pretence which it would afford
him to levy impositions on his own subjects. He sum∣moned
a parliament, to whom he made bitter complaints
against the irruption of the Scots, the absurd imposture
which was countenanced by that nation, the cruel de∣vastation
which they had spread in the northern counties,
and the multiplied insults which had thus been offered
both to the King and kingdom of England. The par∣liament
made the expected return to this discourse of the
King, granting him a subsidy to the amount of 120,000
pounds, together with two fifteenths. After making
this grant, they were dismissed.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="414"/>
THE vote of parliament for imposing the tax was
without much difficulty procured by the authority of
Henry;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1497.</NOTE> but he found it not so easy to levy the money
upon his subjects. The people, who were acquainted
with the immense treasures amassed by the King, could
ill brook the new impositions raised on every slight occa∣sion;
and it is probable, that the slaw, which was uni∣versally
known to lie in his title, made his reign the more
subject to insurrections and rebellions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrection in the West.</NOTE> When the sub∣sidy
began to be levied in Cornwal, the inhabitants,
numerous and poor, robust and courageous, murmured
against a tax, occasioned by a fudden inroad of the
Scots, from which they esteemed themselves entirely se∣cure,
and which had usually been repelled by the force
of the northern counties. Their ill humour was farther
incited by one Michael Joseph, a sarrier of Bodmin, a
notable talking fellow, who, by thrusting himself for∣ward
on every occasion, and being loudest in every com∣plaint
against the government, had acquired an authority
among these rude people. Thomas Flammoc too, a
lawyer, who had become the oracle of the neighbour∣hood,
encouraged the sedition, by informing them, that
the tax, tho' imposed by parliament, was entirely illegal;
that the northern nobility were obliged, by their tenures,
to defend the nation against the Scots; and that if these
new impositions were tamely submitted to, the avarice of
Henry and of his courtiers would soon render the bur∣then
intolerable to the nation. A petition, he said,
must be delivered to the King, seconded by such force
as would give it authority; and in order to procure
the concurrence of the rest of the kingdom, care must
be taken, by their orderly deportment, to shew that they
had nothing in view but the public good, and the re∣dress
of all those grievances, under which the people had
so long laboured.</P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="415"/>
ENCOURAGED by these speeches, the multitude fltocked
together, and armed themselves with axes, bills, bows,
and such weapons as country people are usually possessed
of. Flammoc and Joseph were chosen their leaders.
They soon conducted the Cornish thro' the county of
Devon, and reached that of Somerset. At Taunton the
rebels killed, in their fury, an officious and eager commis∣sioner
of the subsidy, whom they called the provost of
Perin. When they reached Wells, they were joined
by lord Audley, a nobleman of an antient family, po∣pular
in his deportment, but vain, ambitious, and rest∣less
in his temper. He had from the beginning enter∣tained
a secret correspondence with the first movers of
the insurrection; and was now joyfully received by them
as their leader. Proud of the countenance given them
by so considerable a nobleman, they pushed on their
march; breathing destruction to the King's ministers
and favourites, particularly Morton, now a cardinal,
and Sir Reginald Bray, who were deemed his most
active instruments in all his oppressions. Amidst their
rage against the administration, they carefully followed
the directions given them by their leaders; and as they
met with no resistance, they committed, during their
march, no violence or disorder.</P>
<P>THE rebels had been told by Flammoc, that the in∣habitants
of Kent, as they had ever, during all ages,
remained unsubdued, and had even maintained their in∣dependancy
during the Norman conquest, would surely
embrace their party, and declare themselves for a cause,
which was no other than that of public good and ge∣neral
liberty. But the Kentish people had very lately
distinguished themselves by repelling Perkin's invasion;
and having received from the King many gracious ac∣knowledgments
for this service, their affections were,
<PB N="394" REF="416"/>
by that means, much conciliated to his government. It
was easy, therefore, for the earl of Kent, lord Aberga∣venny,
and lord Cobham, who possessed great authority
in those parts, to retain the people in obedience; and
the Cornish rebels, though they pitched their camp near
Eltham, at the very gates of London, and invited all
the people to join them, got reinforcement from no quar∣ter.
There wanted not discontents every where, but
no one would take part in so rash and ill-concerted an
enterprize; and the situation in which the King's affairs
then stood, discouraged even the boldest and most daring.</P>
<P>HENRY, in order to oppose the Scots, had already
levied an army, which he put under the command of
lord Daubeney, the chamberlain; and so soon as he
heard of the Cornish insurrection he ordered it to
march southwards, and suppress the rebels. Not to leave
the northern frontier defenceless, he dispatched thither
the earl of Surry, who summoned out the forces on the
borders, and made head against the enemy. Henry found
here the concurrence of the three most fatal incidents,
which can befal a monarchy; a foreign enemy, a do∣mestic
rebellion, and a pretender to his throne; but he
enjoyed great resources in his army and treasure, and
still more, in the intrepidity and courage of his own
temper. He gave not, however, immediately full scope
to his military spirit. On other occasions, he had al∣ways
hastened to a decision, and it was an usual saying
with him, <HI>that he desired but to see his rebels:</HI> But as the
Cornish insurgents behaved in an inoffensive manner,
and committed no spoil on the country; as they received
no accession of force on their march or in their encamp∣ment;
and as such hasty and popular tumults might be
expected to diminish every moment by delay; he took
post in London, and carefully prepared the means of en∣suring the victory.</P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="417"/>
AFTER all his forces were collected, he divided them
into three bodies, and marched out to assail the enemy.
The first body, commanded by the earl of Oxford, and
under him by the earls of Essex and Suffolk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Blackheath.</NOTE> were ap∣pointed
to place themselves behind the hill on which the
rebels were encamped: The second and most considerable,
Henry put under the command of lord Daubeney, and
ordered him to attack the enemy in front, and bring on
the action. The third, he kept as a body of reserve
about his own person, and took post in St. George's
field; where he secured the city, and could easily, as
occasion served, either restore the fight or finish the vic∣tory.
To put the enemy off their guard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 22d.</NOTE> he had spread
a report that he was not to attack them till some days
after; and the better to confirm them in this opinion,
he began not the action till near the evening. Dau∣beney,
beat a detachment of the rebels from Deptford∣bridge;
and before the main body could be in order to
receive him, he had gained the ascent of the hill, and
placed himself in array before them. They were very
formidable for their numbers, being sixteen thousand
strong, and were not defective in valour; but being tu∣multuary
troops, ill armed, and unprovided of cavalry
or artillery, they were but an unequal match for the
King's forces. Daubeney began the attack with cour∣age,
and even with a contempt of the enemy, which
had almost proved fatal to him. He rushed into the
midst of them, and was taken prisoner; but soon after
was relieved by his own troops. After some resistance,
the rebels were broke, and put to flight<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 601.</NOTE>. Lord Audley,
Flammoc, and Joseph, their leaders, were taken, and
all three executed. The latter seemed even to exult in
his end, and boasted, with a preposterous ambition, that
<PB N="396" REF="418"/>
he should make a figure in history. The rebels, being
surrounded on every side by the King's troops, were al∣most
all made prisoners; and immediately dismissed with∣out
farther punishment: Whether, that Henry was Sa∣tisfied
with the victims who had fallen in the field, and
who amounted to near two thousand, or that he pitied the
ignorance and simplicity of the multitude, or favoured them
on account of their inoffensive behaviour, or was pleased
that they had never, during their insurrection, disputed his
title, and had shewn no attachment to the house of York,
the most capital crime of which, in his eyes, they could
have been guilty.</P>
<P>THE Scottish King was not idle during these commo∣tions
in England. He levied a considerable army, and
sat down before the castle of Norham in Northumber∣land;
but found that place, by the precaution of Fox,
bishop of Durham, so well provided both in men and
ammunition, that he made little or no progress in the
siege. Hearing that the earl of Surry had collected some
forces and was advancing upon him, he retreated back∣wards
into his own country, and left the frontiers ex∣posed
to the inroads of the English general, who be∣sieged
and took Aiton, a small castle lying a sew miles
beyond Berwic. These unsuccessful or frivolous attempts
on both sides, prognosticated a speedy end to the war;
and Henry, notwithstanding his superior force, was no
less desirous than James of terminating the differences
between the nations. Not to depart, however, from his
dignity, by making the first advances towards peace, he
employed in this friendly office Peter Hialas, a man of
address and learning, who had come to him as ambassador
from Ferdinand and Isabella, and who was charged with
a commission of negotiating the marriage of the infanta
<PB N="397" REF="419"/>
Catherine, their daughter, with Arthur prince of
Wales<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 603.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HIALAS took a journey northwards, and offered his
mediation between James and Henry, as minister of a
prince, who was in alliance with both potentates.
Commissioners were soon appointed to meet, and confer
on the terms of accommodation. The first demand of
the English was, that Perkin should be put into their
hands; but James replied, that he himself was no judge
of Perkin's pretensions, but having received him as a
supplicant, and promised him protection, he was deter∣mined
not to betray a man, whatever he was, who had
trusted to his good faith and his generosity. The next
demand of the English met with no better reception:
They required reparation for the ravages committed by
the late inroads into England: The Scots commissioners
replied, that the spoils were like water spilt upon the
ground, which could never be recovered, and that Hen∣ry's
subjects were better able to bear the loss, than their
master's to repair it. Henry's commissioners next pro∣posed,
that the two Kings should have an interview at
Newcastle, in order to adjust all differences; but James
said, that he meant to treat of a peace, not to go a beg∣ging
for it. Lest the conferences should break off al∣together
without effect, a truce was concluded for some
months;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Truce with Scot∣land.</NOTE> and James perceiving, that while Perkin remained in Scotland, he never should enjoy a solid peace
with Henry, privately desired him to depart the king∣dom.</P>
<P>ACCESS was now barred Perkin into the Low Coun∣tries;
his usual retreat in all his disappointments. The
Flemish merchants, who felt severely the loss resulting
<PB N="398" REF="420"/>
from their want of commerce with England, had made
such interest in the arch-duke's council, that commis∣sioners
were sent to London, in order to treat of an ac∣commodation.
The Flemish court agreed that all Eng∣lish
rebels should be excluded the Low Countries; and in
this prohibition the demesnes of the dutchess-dowager
were expresly comprehended. When this principal ar∣ticle
was agreed to, all the other terms were easily ad∣justed.
A treaty of commerce was finished, which was
favourable to the Flemings, and to which they gave long
the appellation of <HI>Intercursus magnus,</HI> the great treaty.
And when the English merchants returned to their usual
abode at Antwerp, they were publicly received, as in
procession, with great joy and festivity.</P>
<P>PERKIN was a Fleming by descent, tho' born in
England; and it might therefore be doubted, whether he
was comprehended in the treaty between the two na∣tions:
But as he must dismiss all his English retainers if
he took shelter in the Low Countries, and as he was
sure of a cold reception, if not bad usage, among a
people who were determined to keep on terms of friend∣ship
with the court of England; he thought fit rather
to hide himself, during some time, in the wilds and fast∣nesses
of Ireland. Impatient however of a retreat, which
was both disagreeable and dangerous, he held consulta∣tions
with his followers, Herne, Skelton, and Astley,
three broken tradesmen; and by their advice, he resolved
to try the affections of the Cornish, whose mutinous dis∣position,
notwithstanding the King's lenity, still subsisted,
after the suppression of their rebellion. No sooner did he
appear at Bodmin in Cornwal, than the populace, to the
number of three thousand men, stocked to his standard;
and Perkin, elated with this appearance of success, took
on him, for the first time, the appellation of Richard
the fourth, King of England. Not to suffer the ex∣pectations
<PB N="399" REF="421"/>
of his followers to languish, he presented
himself before Exeter; and by many fair promises, in∣vited
that city to join his cause. Finding that the in∣habitants
shut their gates against him, he laid siege to
the place; but being unprovided of artillery, ammuni∣tion,
and of every thing requisite for that attempt, he
made no progress in his undertaking. Messengers were
sent to the King, informing him of this insurrection
and the citizens of Exeter meanwhile were determined to
hold out to the last extremity, in expectation of receiving
succour from the known vigilance of that monarch.</P>
<P>WHEN Henry was informed, that Perkin was landed
in England, he expressed great joy, and prepared him∣self
with alacrity to attack him, in hopes of being able,
at last, to put a period to a pretension, which had so
long given him vexation and inquietude. All the cour∣tiers,
sensible that their activity on this occasion would
be the most acceptable service which they could render
the King, prepared themselves for the enterprize, and
forwarded his preparations. The lords Daubeney, and
Broke, with Sir Rice ap Thomas, hastened forward
with a small body of troops to the relief of Exeter.
The earl of Devonshire, and the most considerable
gentlemen in the county of that name, took arms of
their own accord, and marched to join the King's ge∣nerals.
The duke of Buckingham put himself at the
head of a troop of young nobility and gentry, who served
as voluntiers, and who longed for an opportunity of
displaying their courage and their loyalty. The King
himself prepared to follow with a considerable army;
and thus all England seemed united against a pretender,
who had at first engaged their attention and divided their
affections.</P>
<P>PERKIN, informed of these great preparations, imme∣diately
broke up the siege of Exeter, and retired to
<PB N="400" REF="422"/>
Taunton. Tho' his followers now amounted to the
number of near seven thousand men, and seemed still
resolute to defend his cause, he himself despaired of
success, and secretly withdrew to the sanctuary of Beau∣lieu
in the new forest. The Cornish rebels submitted
themselves to the King's mercy, and found that it was
not yet exhausted in their behalf. Except a few persons
of desperate fortunes, who were executed, and some
others who were severely fined, all the rest were dismist
with impunity. The Lady Catherine Gordon, wife to
Perkin, fell into the conqueror's hands, and was treated
with a generosity, which does him honour. He soothed
her mind with many tokens of regard, placed her in a
reputable station about the Queen, and assigned her a
pension, which she enjoyed even under his successor.</P>
<P>HENRY next deliberated what course to take with
Perkin himself. Some counselled him to make the pri∣vileges
of the church yield to reasons of state, to take him
by violence from the sanctuary, to inflict on him the pu∣nishment
due to his temerity, and thus at once to put an
end to an imposture which had long disturbed the go∣vernment,
and which the credulity of the people and
the artifices of malecontents were still capable of reviving.
But the King deemed not the matter of such importance
as to merit so, violent a remedy. He employed some per∣sons
to deal with Perkin, and persuade him, under pro∣mise
of pardon, to deliver himself into the King's hands<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 606.</NOTE>.
The King conducted him in a species of mock triumph
to London.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Perkin taken pri∣soner.</NOTE> As Perkin passed along the road, and
through the streets of that city, men of all ranks stocked
about him, and the populace treated with the highest de∣ri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion
his fallen fortunes. They seemed desirous of re∣venging
themselves by their insults for the shame which
<PB N="401" REF="423"/>
their former belief of his impostures had thrown upon
them. Tho' the eyes of the nation were generally
opened with regard to Perkin's real parentage and station,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1498.</NOTE>
Henry thought proper to require of him a confession of
his life and adventures; and he ordered the account of
the whole to be published soon after for the satisfaction of
the public. But as his regard to decency made him sup∣press
entirely the share which the dutchess of Burgundy
had had in contriving and conducting the imposture, the
people, who knew that she had been the chief instrument
in the whole affair, were inclined, on account of the
silence on that head, to pay the less credit to the authen∣ticity
of the narrative.</P>
<P>BUT Perkin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1499.</NOTE> tho' his life was granted him, was still
detained in custody; and keepers were appointed to guard
him. Impatient of confinement, he broke loose from
his keepers, and flying to the fanctuary of Shyne, put
himself into the hands of the prior of that monastery.
The prior had obtained great credit by his character of
sanctity; and he prevailed with the King again to grant
a pardon to Perkin. But in order to reduce him to still
greater contempt, he was set in the stocks at West∣minster
and Cheapside, and obliged in both places to
read aloud to the people the confession which had been
formerly published in his name. He was then thrown into
the Tower, where his habits of restless intrigue and enter∣prize
still followed him. He insinuated himself into the
intimacy of four servants of Sir John Digby, lieutenant
of the Tower; and by their means, opened a corre∣spondence
with the earl of Warwic, who was confined
to the same prison. That unfortunate prince, who had
from his earliest infancy been shut up from the commerce
of men, and who was ignorant even of the most com∣mon
affairs of life, had fallen into a simplicity which
<PB N="402" REF="424"/>
made him susceptible of any impressions. The continued
dread also of the more violent effects of Henry's tyranny,
joined to the natural love of liberty, engaged him to em∣brace
a project for his escape, by the murder of the lieu∣tenant;
and Perkin offered to conduct the whole enter∣prize.
The conspiracy escaped not the King's vigilance:
It was even very generally believed, that the scheme was
laid by himself, in order to draw Perkin and Warwic
into the snare: But the subsequent execution of two of
Digby's servants for the contrivance, seems to clear the
King of that imputation, which was indeed founded
more on the general idea entertained of his character,
than on any positive evidence.</P>
<P>PERKIN, by this new attempt, after so many enormi∣ties,
had rendered himself totally unworthy of mercy;
and he was accordingly arraigned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Perkin executed.</NOTE> condemned, and soon
after hanged at Tyburn, persisting still in the confession
of his imposture<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Stowe, Baker, Speed, Biondi, Hollingshed, Bacon. Some late writers have been so whimsical as to doubt, whether Perkin was an im∣postor, and even to assert him to be the real Richard Plantagenet, duke of York. But to refute this fancy, we need but reflect on the few fol∣lowing particulars. 1. Had not the Queen-mother, and the other heads of the York party, been fully assured of the death of both the young princes, would they have agreed to call over the earl of Rich∣mond, the head of the Lancastrian party, and marry him to the princess Elizabeth? 2. The story told constantly by Perkin of his escape is ut∣terly incredible, that those who were sent to murder his brother took pity on him, and granted him his liberty. 3. What became of him during the course of seven years, from his supposed death till his appear∣ance in Ireland in 1491? Why was not the Queen-mother, the dutchess of Bur∣gundy, and the other friends of the family applied to, during that time, for his support and education? 4. Tho' the dutchess of Burgundy at last acknowledged him for her nephew, she had lost all pre∣tence to authority by her former acknowledgment and support of Lam∣bert Sim<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el, an avowed impostor. It is remarkable, that Mr. Carte, in order to preserve the weight of the dutchess's testimony, in favour of Parkin, supresses entirely this material fact. A remarkable effect of party prejudices, and the author's desire of blackening Henry the Seventh, whose hereditary title to the crown was defective. 5. Pefkin himself con∣fessed his imposture more than once, and read his confession before the whole people. It is pretended that this confession was drawn from him by torture; but no ancient historian gives any ground for this surmise. 6. He renewed his confession at the foot of the gibbet on which he was executed. 7. After Henry the Eighth's accession the titles of the house of York and Lancaster were fully confounded, and there was no longer any necessity for defending Henry the Seventh and his title; yet all the historians of that time, when the events were recent, some of these historians too, such as Sir Thomas More, of the highest authority, agree in treating Perkin as an impostor.</NOTE>. It happened about that very time,
<PB N="403" REF="425"/>
that one Wilford, a cordwainer's son, encouraged by
the surprising credit which had been given to other im∣postures,
had undertaken to personate the earl of War∣wic;
and a priest had even ventured from the pulpit to
recommend his cause to the people, who seemed still to
retain a propensity to adopt it. This incident served
Henry as an apology for his severity towards that unfor∣tunate
prince. He was brought to trial, and accused,
not of contriving his escape, (for as he was committed
for no crime, the desire of liberty must have been regar∣ded
as natural and innocent) but of forming designs to
disturb the government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The earl of Warwic executed. 21st of November.</NOTE> and raise an insurrection among
the people. Warwic confessed the indictment, was con∣demned,
and the sentence was executed upon him.</P>
<P>THIS violent tyranny, the great stain of Henry's
reign, by which he destroyed the last remaining male
of the line of Plantagenet, begot great discontent among
the people, who saw an unhappy prince, that had long
been denied all the privileges of his high birth, even
cut off from the common benefits of nature, now at last
deprived of life itself, merely for resisting that oppression
<PB N="404" REF="426"/>
under which he laboured. In vain did Henry endea∣vour
to alleviate the odium of this guilt, by sharing it
with his ally, Ferdinand of Arragon, who, he said,
had scrupled to give his daughter Catherine in marriage
to Arthur, while any prince of the house of York re∣mained
alive. Men, on the contrary, felt higher indig∣nation
at seeing a young prince sacrificed, not to law
and justice, but to the jealous politics of two subtile and
crafty tyrants.</P>
<P>BUT tho' these discontents festered in the minds
of men, they were so checked by Henry's watchful po∣licy
and steady severity, that they seemed not to weaken
his government; and foreign princes, deeming his throne
now entirely secure, paid him rather the greater court∣ship
and attention. The archduke Philip, in particular,
desired an interview with the King; and this monarch,
who had passed over to Calais, agreed to meet him at
St. Peter's church near that city. The archduke, on his
approaching the King, made haste to alight, and offered
to hold Henry's stirrup; a mark of condescension, which
that prince would not admit of. He called the King
<HI>father, patron, protector;</HI> and by his whole behaviour
expressed a strong desire of conciliating the friendship of
England. The duke of Orleans had succeeded to the
kingdom of France under the appellation of Lewis the
Twelfth; and having carried his arms into Italy, and
subdued the dutchy of Milan, his progress begot jealousy
in Maximilian, Philip's father, as well as in Ferdinand,
his father-in-law. By the council, therefore, of these
monarchs, the young prince endeavoured by every art
to acquire the amity of Henry, whom they regarded as
the chief counterpoize to the greatness of France. No
particular plan however of alliance seems to have been
concerted between these two princes in their interview:
<PB N="405" REF="427"/>
All passed in general professions of affection and regard;
at least, in remote projects of a closer union, by the fu∣ture
intermarriages of their children, who were then in
a state of infancy.</P>
<P>THE pope too,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1500.</NOTE> Alexander the Sixth, neglected not
the friendship of a monarch, whose reputation was spread
over all Europe. He sent a nuntio to England, who ex∣horted
the King to take part in the great alliance pro∣jected
for the recovery of the Holy Land, and to lead in
person his forces against the Turk. The general frenzy
for crusades was now entirely exhausted in Europe; but
it was still thought a necessary piece of decency to pre∣tend
zeal for those pious enterprizes. Henry regretted
the distance of his situation, which rendered it incon∣venient
for him to expose his person in defence of the
Christian cause. He promised, however, his utmost
assistance by aids and contributions; and rather than
the pope should go alone to the holy wars, unaccompanied
by any monarch, he even promised to overlook all
other considerations, and to attend him in person. He
only required as a necessary condition, that all differences
should be previously composed among Christian princes,
and that some sea-port towns in Italy should be put into
his hands for his retreat and security. It was easy to
conclude from this answer, that Henry had determined
with himself not to intermeddle in any wars against the
Turk: But as a great name, without any real assistance,
is sometimes of service, the knights of Rhodes, who were
at that time esteemed the bulwark of Christendom, chose
the King protector of their order.</P>
<P>BUT the prince, whose alliance Henry valued the
most, was that of Ferdinand of Arragon, whose vigorous
and steady policy, always attended with success, had
<PB N="406" REF="428"/>
rendered him in many respects, the most considerable
monarch in Europe. There was also a remarkable simi∣larity
of character between these two princes: Both
were full of craft, intrigue, and design; and tho' a
resemblance of this nature be a slender foundation of
confidence and friendship, where the interests of the par∣ties
in the least interfere; yet such was the situation of
Henry and Ferdinand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1501.</NOTE> that no jealousy ever on any oc∣casion
arose between them. The King had now the
satisfaction of compleating a marriage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of prince Arthur with Ca∣therine of Arragon. 12th of No∣vember.</NOTE> which had been
projected and negotiated during the course of seven years,
between Arthur prince of Wales and the infanta Ca∣therine,
fourth daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella; he
near sixteen years of age, she eighteen. But this mar∣riage
proved in the issue unprosperous. The young
prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d of A∣pril. His death.</NOTE> a few months after, sickened and died, very
much regreted by the whole nation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1502.</NOTE> Henry, desirous
to continue his alliance with Spain, and also unwilling
to restore Catherine's dowry, which was two hundred
thousand ducats, obliged his second son, Henry, whom
he created prince of Wales, to be contracted to the
princess. The prince made all the opposition which a
youth of twelve years of age was capable of; but as the
King persisted in his resolution, the espousals were at
last, by means of the pope's dispensation, concluded be∣tween
the parties: An event, which was afterwards at∣tended
with the most important consequences.</P>
<P>THE same year, another marriage was concluded,
which was also,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of the princess Margaret with the King of Scotland.</NOTE> in the next age, productive of great
events; The marriage of Margaret, the King's eldest
daughter, with James King of Scotland. This alliance
had been negotiated during three years, tho' interrupted
by several broils; and Henry hoped, from the comple∣tion
of it, to remove all source of discord with that
<PB N="407" REF="429"/>
neighbouring kingdom, by whose animosity England
had been so often infested. When this marriage was
deliberated on in the English council, some objected,
that England might, by means of that alliance, fall un∣der
the dominion of Scotland. “No;” replied Henry,
“Scotland, in that event, would only become an ac∣cession
to England.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">1503.</NOTE> Amidst these prosperous events,
the King met with a domestic calamity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th of Fe∣bruary.</NOTE> which made not
such impression on him as it merited. His queen died
in child-bed; and the infant lived not long after. This
princess was deservedly a great favourite of the nation;
and the general affection for her encreased, on account
of the harsh treatment, which, it was thought, she met
with from her consort.</P>
<P>THE situation of the King's affairs, both at home
and abroad, was now, in every respect, very fortunate.
All the efforts of the European princes, both in war
and negotiation, were turned to the side of Italy; and
the various events, which there arose, made Henry's
alliance be courted by every party, and yet interested
him so little as never to touch him with concern or
anxiety. His close connexions with Spain and Scotland
ensured his tranquillity; and his continued successes
over domestic enemies, owing to the prudence and vi∣gour
of his conduct, had reduced the people to entire
submission and obedience. Henry therefore, uncontroul∣ed
by apprehension or opposition of any kind, gave full
scope to his natural propensity;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oppres∣sions of the people.</NOTE> and avarice, which had
ever been his predominant passion, being encreased by
age, and encouraged by absolute authority, broke all
restraints of shame or justice. He had found two mini∣sters,
Empson and Dudley, perfectly qualified to second
his rapacious and tyrannical inclinations, and to prey
upon his defenceless people. These instruments of oppres∣sion
<PB N="408" REF="430"/>
were both lawyers, the first of mean birth, of bru∣tal
manners, of an unrelenting temper; the second bet∣ter
born, better educated, and better bred, but equally
unjust, severe, and inflexible. By their knowledge in
the law, these men were qualified to pervert the forms
of justice to the oppression of the innocent; and the
formidable authority of the King supported them in all
their iniquities.</P>
<P>IT was their usual practice at first to observe so far
the appearance of law as to give indictments to those
whom they intended to oppress: Upon which the per∣sons
were committed to prison, but never brought to
trial; and were at last obliged to recover their liberty,
by paying heavy fines and ransoms, which were called
mitigations and compositions. By degrees, the very ap∣pearance
of law was neglected: They sent forth their
precepts to attach men, and summon them before them∣selves
and some others, at their private houses, in a court
of commission, where, in a summary manner, without
trial or jury, arbitrary decrees were issued, both in pleas
of the crown and controversies between private parties.
Juries themselves, when summoned, proved but small
security to the subject; being brow-beat by these oppres∣sors;
nay, fined, imprisoned, and punished, if they g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve
sentence against the inclination of the ministers. The
whole system of the feudal law, which still prevailed,
was turned into a scheme of oppression. Even the
King's wards, after they came to full age, were not
suffered to enter in possession of their lands without pay∣ing
exorbitant fines. Men were also harassed with in∣formations
of intrusion upon scarce colourable titles.
When an outlawry in a personal action was issued against
any man, he was not allowed to purchase his charter of
<PB N="409" REF="431"/>
pardon, except on the payment of a great sum; and if
he refused the composition required of him, the strict
law, which, in such cases, allows forfeiture of goods,
was rigorously insisted on. Nay, without any colour of
law, the half of men's lands and rents were seized during
two years, as a penalty in case of outlawry. But the
chief instruments of oppression, employed by these mi∣nisters,
were the penal statutes, which, without consi∣deration
of rank, quality, or services, were rigidly put
in execution against all men: Spies, informers, and
inquisitors were rewarded and encouraged in every cor∣ner
of the kingdom: And no difference was made whe∣ther
the statute was beneficial or hurtful, recent or ob∣solete,
possible or impossible to be executed. The sole
end of the King and his ministers was to amass money,
and bring every one under the lash of their authority<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Bacon, 629, 630. Hollingshed, p. 504. Polyd. Virg. p. 613. 615.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THRO' the prevalence of such an arbitrary and iniqui∣tous
administration, the English, it may safely be af∣firmed,
were considerable losers by the ancient privilege,
which secured them from all taxations and impositions,
except such as were levied by their own consent. Had
the King been empowered to lay on general taxes at
pleasure, he would naturally have abstained from these
oppressive expedients, which destroyed all security in
private property, and begot an universal diffidence thro'
the nation. In vain did the people look for pro∣tection
from the parliament, which was pretty frequent∣ly
summoned during this reign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1504.</NOTE> That assembly was so
overawed, that, at this very time, during the greatest
rage of Henry's oppressions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th Jan. A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> the commons chose Dudley
their speaker, the very man who was the chief instru∣ment
<PB N="410" REF="432"/>
of his oppressions. And tho' the King was known
to be immensely opulent, and had no pretence of
wars or expensive enterprizes of any kind, they grant∣ed
him the subsidy, which he demanded. But so insa∣tiable
was his avarice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1505.</NOTE> that next year he levied a new
benevolence, and renewed that arbitrary and oppressive
method of taxation. By all these arts of accumulation,
joined to a rigid frugality in his expence, he so filled his
coffers, that he is said to have possessed in ready money
the sum of 1,800,000 pounds: An incredible treasure,
if we consider the scarcity of money in those days<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Silver was during this reign at 37 shillings and sixpence a pound, which makes Henry's treasure above 2,750,000 pounds sterling. Be∣sides, many commodities have become thrice as dear by the encrease of gold and silver in Europe. And what is a circumstance of still greater weight, all other states were then very poor, in comparison of what they are at present: These circumstances make Henry's treasure appeal very great; and may lead us to conceive the oppressions of his govern∣ment.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT while Henry was enriching himself with the
spoils of his oppressed people, there happened an event
abroad, which engaged his attention, and was even the
object of his anxiety and concern. Isabella, queen of
Castile, died about this time; and it was foreseen, that
by this incident the fortunes of Ferdinand, her husband,
would be much affected. The King was not only at∣tentive
to the fate of his ally, and watchful lest the ge∣neral
system of Europe should be affected by so impor∣tant
an event: He also considered the similarity of his
own situation with that of Ferdinand, and regarded the
issue of these transactions as a precedent for himself.
Joan, the daughter of Ferdinand by Isabella, was mar∣ried
to the archduke Philip, and being, in right of her
mother, heiress of Castile, seemed entitled to dispute
with Ferdinand the present administration of that king∣dom.
<PB N="411" REF="433"/>
Henry knew, that, notwithstanding his own pre∣tensions
by the house of Lancaster, the greatest part of
the nation were convinced of the superiority of his wife's
title; and he dreaded lest the prince, who was daily ad∣vancing
towards manhood, might be tempted by ambi∣tion
to lay immediate claim to the throne. By his per∣petual
attention to depress the partizans of the York
family, he had more closely united them into one party,
and encreased their desire of shaking off that yoke, under
which they had so long laboured, and of taking every
advantage, which his oppressive government should give
his enemies against him. And as he possessed no inde∣pendent
force like Ferdinand, and governed a kingdom
more turbulent and unruly, which he himself, by his
narrow politics, had confirmed in factious prejudices;
he apprehended that his situation would prove in the
issue still more precarious.</P>
<P>NOTHING could turn out more contrary to the King's
inclinations than the transactions in Spain. Ferdinand
had become very unpopular in Castile, chiefly by reason
of his former exactions and impositions; and the states
of the kingdom discovered an evident resolution of pre∣ferring
the title of Philip and Joan.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1506.</NOTE> In order to take
advantage of these favourable dispositions, the archduke,
now King of Castile, attended by his consort, embarked
for Spain during the winter season; and meeting with a
violent tempest in the channel, was obliged to take shel∣ter
in the harbour of Weymouth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A rival of the King of Castile.</NOTE> Sir John Trenchard,
a gentleman of authority in the county of Dorset, hear∣ing
of a fleet upon the coast, had assembled some forces;
and being joined by Sir John Cary, who was also at the
head of an armed body, he came to that town. Finding,
that Philip, in order to relieve his sickness and fatigue,
was already come ashore, he invited him to his house;
<PB N="412" REF="434"/>
and immediately dispatched an express to inform the
court of this important incident. The King sent in all
haste the earl of Arundel to compliment the archduke
on his arrival in England, and to inform him, that he
intended to pay him a visit in person, and to give him
a suitable reception in his kingdom. Philip knew,
that he could not now depart without the King's consent;
and therefore, for the sake of dispatch, he resolved to
anticipate his visit, and to have an interview with him
at Windsor. Henry received him with all the magni∣ficence
possible, and with all the seeming cordiality;
but he resolved, notwithstanding, to extract some advan∣tage
from this involuntary visit, payed him by his royal
guest.</P>
<P>EDMOND de la Pole, earl of Suffolk, nephew to Ed∣ward
the fourth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrigues of the earl of Suffolk.</NOTE> and brother to the earl of Lincoln,
slain at the battle of Stoke, had some years before killed
a man in a sudden fit of passion, and had been obliged
to apply to the King for a remission of his crime. The
King had granted his request; but being little indulgent
to all persons connected with the house of York, he
obliged him to appear openly in court and plead his par∣don.
Suffolk more resenting the affront, than grateful
for the favour, had fled into Flanders, and taken shelter
with his aunt, the dutchess of Burgundy: But being
promised forgiveness by the King, he returned into Eng∣land,
and obtained a new pardon. Actuated, however,
by the natural inquietude of his temper, and uneasy from
debts which he had contracted by his expences at prince
Arthur's marriage, he again made an elopement into
Flanders. The King, well acquainted with the general
discontent which prevailed against his administration, ne∣glected
not this incident, which might become of im∣portance;
and he employed his usual artifices to elude
<PB N="413" REF="435"/>
the efforts of his enemies. He directed Sir Robert Cur∣son,
governor of the castle of Hammes, to fly from his
charge, and to infinuate himself into the confidence of
Suffolk, by making him a tender of his services. Upon
information secretly conveyed by Curson, the King seized
William Courtney, earl of Devonshire, his brother in
law, married to the lady Catherine, daughter of Edward
the fourth; William de la Pole, brother to the earl of
Suffolk; Sir James Tirrel, and Sir James Windham,
with some persons of inferior quality; and he committed
them all to custody. The lord Abergavenny and Sir
Thomas Green were also apprehended; but were soon
after freed from their confinement. William de la Pole
was detained in prison during a long time: And the earl
of Devonshire recovered not his freedom during the
King's life. But Henry's chief severity fell upon Sir
James Windham, and Sir James Tirrel, who were both
brought to their trial, condemned, and executed: The
fate of the latter gave universal satisfaction, on account
of his participation in the murder of the young princes,
sons to Edward the fourth. Notwithstanding these dis∣coveries
and executions, Curson was still able to main∣tain
his credit with the earl of Suffolk; and Henry, in
order to remove all suspicious, had ordered him to be ex∣communicated,
together with Suffolk himself, for his
pretended rebellion. But after that traitor had performed
all the services expected from him, he suddenly deserted
the earl, and came over to England, where the King
received him with unusual marks of favour and confi∣dence.
Suffolk, astonished at this instance of perfidy,
finding that even the dutchess of Burgundy, tired with
so many fruitless attempts, had become indifferent to his
cause, fled secretly into France, thence into Germany, and
returned at last into the Low Countries; where he
<PB N="414" REF="436"/>
was protected, tho' not countenanced, by the archduke
Philip, then in close alliance with the King.</P>
<P>HENRY neglected not the present opportunity of com∣plaining
to Philip of the reception, which Suffolk had
met with in his dominions. “I really thought,” re∣plied
the King of Castile, “that your greatness and
felicity had set you far above apprehensions from any
person of so little consequence: But to give you sa∣tisfaction,
I shall banish him my state.” “I expect,
that you will carry your complaisance farther,” said
the King: “I desire to have Suffolk put into my hands,
where alone I can depend upon his submission and
obedience.” “That measure,” said Philip, “will
reflect dishonour upon you as well as myself. You
will be thought to have used me as a prisoner.” “Then
the matter is at an end,” replied the King, “for I
will take that dishonour upon me; and so your ho∣nour
is saved<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 633.</NOTE>.” The King of Castile found him∣self
under a necessity of complying; but he first exacted
Henry's promise that he would spare Suffolk's life. That
nobleman was invited over to England by Philip; as if
the King would grant him a pardon, by the intercession
of his friend and ally. Upon his appearance, he was
committed to the Tower; and the King of Castile,
having fully satisfied Henry, as well by this concession,
as by signing a treaty of commerce between England and
Castile, which was advantageous to the former king∣dom<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xiii. p. 142.</NOTE>,
was at last allowed to depart, after a stay of three
months.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1507.</NOTE> He landed in Spain, was joyfully received by
the Castilians, and put in possession of the throne. He
died soon after; and Joan, his widow, falling into deep
melancholy, Ferdinand was again enabled to re-instate
<PB N="415" REF="437"/>
himself in his authority, and to govern, till the day of
his death, the whole Spanish monarchy.</P>
<P>THE King survived these transactions two years; but
little memorable occurs in the remaining part of his
reign, except his affiancing his second daughter Mary
with the young archduke Charles, son of Philip of Ca∣stile.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1508.</NOTE>
He entertained also some intention of marriage
for himself, first with the Queen-dowager of Naples,
relict of Ferdinand; afterwards with the dutchess-dow∣ager
of Savoy, daughter of Maximilian, and sister of
Philip.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sickness of the King.</NOTE> But the decline of his health put an end to
all such thoughts; and he began to cast his eye towards
that future existence, which the iniquities and severities
of his reign rendered a very dismal prospect to him. To
allay the terrors, under which he laboured, he endea∣voured,
by distributing alms and founding religious
houses, to make atonement for his crimes, and to pur∣chase,
by the sacrifice of part of his ill-gotten treasures,
a reconciliation with his offended Maker. Remorse even
seized him at intervals for the abuses of his authority by
Empson and Dudley; but not sufficient to make him
stop the rapacious hands of those oppressors. Sir Wil∣liam
Capel was again fined two thousand pounds under
some frivolous pretences, and was committed to the
Tower for daring to murmur against that iniquity. Har∣ris,
an alderman of London, was indicted, and died of
vexation before his trial came to an issue. Sir Law∣rence
Ailmer, who had been mayor, and his two sheriffs,
were condemned in heavy fines, and sent to prison till
they made payment. The King gave countenance to all
these oppressions; till death, by its nearer approaches,
impressed new terrors upon him; and he then ordered,
by a general clause in his will,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1509.</NOTE> that restitution should be
made to all those whom he had injured.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His death 22d April.</NOTE> He died of a
<PB N="416" REF="438"/>
consumption at his favourite palace of Richmond, after
a reign of twenty-three years and eight months, and in
the fifty-second year of his age<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Dugd. baronage II. p. 237.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE reign of Henry the seventh was, in the main,
fortunate for his people at home, and honourable abroad.
He put an end to the civil wars with which the nation
had been long harrassed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And cha∣racter.</NOTE> he maintained peace and order
in the state, he depressed the former exorbitant power of
the nobility, and, together with the friendship of some
foreign princes, he acquired the consideration and regard
of all. He loved peace without fearing war; tho' agi∣tated
with continual suspicions of his servants and mini∣sters,
he discovered no timidity either in the conduct of
his affairs, or in the day of battle; and tho' often severe
in his punishments, he was commonly less actuated by
revenge than by the maxims of policy. The services,
which he rendered the people, were derived from his
views of private interest, rather than the motives of pub∣lic
spirit; and where he deviated from selfish regards, it
was unknown to himself, and ever from the malignant
prejudices of faction, or the mean projects of avarice;
not from the sallies of passion, or allurements of plea∣sure;
still less, from the benign motives of friendship and
generosity. His capacity was excellent, but somewhat
contracted by the narrowness of his heart; he possessed
insinuation and address, but never employed these talents,
except where some great point of interest was to be gain∣ed;
and while he neglected to conciliate the affections of
his people, he often felt the danger of resting his autho∣rity
on their fear and reverence alone. He was always
extremely attentive to his affairs. But possessed not the
faculty of seeing far into futurity; and was more expert
<PB N="417" REF="439"/>
at providing a remedy for his mistakes than judicious in
avoiding them. Avarice was on the whole his ruling
passion<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">As a proof of Henry's attention to the smallest profits, Bacon tells us, that he had seen a book of accompts kept by Empson, and sub∣scribed in almost every leaf by the King's own hand. Among other articles was the following. “<HI>Item,</HI> Received of such a one <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive marks for a pardon, which, if it do not pass, the money to be repayed, or the party otherwise satisfied. Opposite to this memorandum, the King had wrote with his own hand, “otherwise satisfied.” Bacon, p. 630.</NOTE>; and he remains an instance, almost singular,
of a man, placed in a high station, and possessed of ta∣lents
for great affairs, in whom that passion predominated
above ambition. Even among private persons, avarice
is commonly nothing but a species of ambition, and is
chiefly incited by the prospect of that regard, distinction
and consideration which attend on riches.</P>
<P>THE power of the Kings of England had always been
somewhat irregular or discretionary; but was scarce ever
so absolute during any former reign, at least after the
establishment of the great charter, as during that of
Henry. Besides the personal character of the man, full
of vigour, industry, and severity, deliberate in all pro∣jects,
steady in every purpose, and attended with cau∣tion,
as well as good fortune, in each enterprize; he
came to the throne after long and bloody civil wars,
which had destroyed all the great nobility, who alone
could resist the encroachments of his authority: The
people were tired with discord and intestine convulsions,
and willing to submit to usurpations, and even to inju∣ries,
rather than plunge themselves anew into like mi∣series:
The fruitless efforts made against him served al∣ways,
as is usual, to confirm his authority: As he ruled
by a faction, and the lesser faction, all those on whom
he conferred offices, sensible that they owed every thing
<PB N="418" REF="440"/>
to his protection, were content to support his power,
tho' at the expence of justice and national privileges.
These seem the chief causes which at this time bestowed
on the crown so considerable an addition of prerogative,
and rendered the present reign a kind of epoch in the
English constitution.</P>
<P>THIS prince, tho' he exalted his own prerogative
above law, is celebrated by his historian for many good
laws, which he caused to be enacted for the government
of his subjects. Several considerable regulations, indeed,
are found among the statutes of this reign, both with re∣gard
to the police of the kingdom, and its commerce:
But the former are generally contrived with much better
judgment than the latter.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His laws.</NOTE> The more simple ideas of order
and equity are sufficient to guide a legislator in every thing
that regards the internal administration of justice: But
the principles of commerce are much more com∣plicated,
and require long experience and deep reflection
to be well understood in any state. The real conse∣quence
of a law or practice is there often contrary to
first appearances. No wonder, that during the reign of
Henry the seventh, these matters were often misunder∣stood;
and it may safely be affirmed, that even in the
age of lord Bacon, very imperfect and erroneous ideas
were formed on that subject.</P>
<P>EARLY in Henry's reign, the authority of the Star
Chamber, which was before founded on common law,
and very antient practice, was in some cases confirmed
by act of parliament<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rot. Parl. 3 H. 7. n. 17.</NOTE>: Lord Bacon extols the use of
this court; but men began, during the age of that histo∣rian,
to feel that so arbitrary a jurisdiction was totally
incompatible with liberty; and in proportion as the spirit
<PB N="419" REF="441"/>
of independance rose still higher in the nation, the aver∣sion
against it increased, till it was entirely abolished by
act of parliament in the reign of Charles the first, a little
before the commencement of the civil wars.</P>
<P>LAWS were passed in this reign, ordering the King's
suit for murder to be carried on within a year and day<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 1.</NOTE>.
Formerly, it did not usually commence till after that
term; and as the friends of the person murdered, in the
interval often compounded matters with the criminal,
that crime very frequently passed unpunished. Suits were
given to the poor <HI>in forma pauperis,</HI> as it is called: That
is, without paying dues for the writs, or any fees to the
council<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">11 H. 7. cap. 12.</NOTE>: A good law at all times, especially in that
age, when the people laboured under the oppression of
the great; but a law very difficult to be reduced to exe∣cution.
A law was made against carrying off any wo∣man
by force<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 2.</NOTE>. The benefit of clergy was abridged<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">4 H. 7. cap. 13.</NOTE>,
and the criminal, on the first offence, was ordered to
be burned in the hand with a letter marking his crime;
after which he was punished capitally for any new of∣fence.
This law was much too indulgent, yet was in
those days regarded as a violation of the rights of the
church. Sheriffs were no longer allowed to fine any
person, without previously summoning him before their
court<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">11 H. 7. cap. 15.</NOTE>. It is strange, that such a practice should ever
have prevailed. Attaint of juries was granted in cases
which exceeded forty pounds value<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. 24. 19 H. 7. cap. 3.</NOTE>. A law which has
an appearance of equity, but which was afterwards
found inconvenient. Actions popular were not allowed
to be eluded by fraud or covin. If any servant of the
King conspired against the life of the steward, treasurer,
<PB N="420" REF="442"/>
or comptroller of the King's houshold, this design, tho'
not followed by any act, was made liable to the punish∣ment
of felony<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 13.</NOTE>. This statute was procured by the
jealousy of archbishop Morton, who found himself ex∣posed
to the enmity of great numbers.</P>
<P>THERE scarce passed any session during this reign
wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ut some statute against engaging retainers, and
giving them badges or liveries<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. 1. &amp; 12. 11 H. 7. cap. 3. 19 H. 7. cap. 14.</NOTE>; a practice, by which
they were, in a manner, inlisted under some great lord,
and were kept in readiness to assist him in all wars, in∣surrections,
riots, violences, and even in bearing evi∣dence
for him in courts of justice<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 12. 11 H. 7. cap. 25.</NOTE>. This disorder,
which had arisen during turbulent times, when the law
could give little protection to the subject, was then deeply
rooted in England; and it required all the vigilance and
rigour of Henry to extirpate it. There is a story of his
severity against that abuse; which seems to merit praise,
tho' it is commonly cited as an instance of his avarice
and rapacity. The earl of Oxford, his favourite gene∣ral,
in whom he always placed great and deserved trust,
having splendidly entertained him at his castle of Hening∣ham,
was desirous of making a show of his magnificence
at the departure of his royal guest; and ordered all his
retainers, with their liveries and badges, to be drawn up
in two lines, that their appearance might be more gallant
and splendid. “My lord,” said the King, “I have
heard much of your hospitality; but the truth far ex∣ceeds
the report. These handsome gentlemen and
yeomen, whom I see on both sides of me, are, no
doubt, your menial servants.” The earl smiled, and
confessed that his fortune was too narrow for such
<PB N="421" REF="443"/>
magnificence. “They are most of them,” subjoined
he, “my retainers, who are come to do me service at
such a time, when they knew I was honoured with
your majesty's presence.” The King started a little,
and said, “By my faith, my lord, I thank you for my
good cheer, but I must not allow my laws to be brok∣en
in my sight. My attorney must speak with you.”
Oxford is said to have payed no less than fifteen thou∣sand
marks, as a composition for his offence.</P>
<P>THE encrease of the arts, more effectually than all
the severities of laws, put an end to this pernicious
practice. The nobility, instead of vying with each
other, in the number and boldness of their retainers, ac∣quired
by degrees a more civilized species of emulation,
and endeavoured to excel in the splendour and elegance
of their equipage, houses, and tables. The common
people, no longer maintained in a vicious idleness by
their superiors, were obliged to learn some calling or in∣dustry,
and became useful both to themselves and others.
And it must be acknowledged, in spite of those who de∣claim
so violently against the refinement of the arts, or
what they are pleased to call luxury, that, as much as
an industrious tradesman is both a better man and a bet∣ter
citizen than one of those idle retainers, who formerly
depended on the great families; so much is the life of a mo∣dern
nobleman more laudable than that of an antient baron.</P>
<P>BUT the most important law in its con
equences, which was enacted during the reign of Henry, was that
by which the nobility and gentry acquired a power of
breaking the antient entails, and of alienating their
estates<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">4 H. 7. cap. 24. The practice of breaking entails by means of a fine and recovery was introduced in the reign of Edward the 4th: But it was not, properly speaking, law, till the statute of Henry the 7th; which, by correcting some abuses that attended that practice, gave indi∣rectly a sanction to it.</NOTE>. By means of this law, joined to the beginning
<PB N="422" REF="444"/>
luxury and refinements of the age, the great fortunes of
the barons were gradually dissipated, and the property of
the commons encreased in England. It is probable, that
Henry foresaw and intended this consequence; because
the constant scheme of his policy consisted in depressing
the great, and exalting churchmen, lawyers, and men
of new families, who were more dependant on him.</P>
<P>THIS King's love of money naturally led him to en∣courage
commerce, which encreased his customs; but, if
we may judge by most of the laws enacted during his
reign, trade and industry were rather hurt than promoted
by the care and attention which were given to them.
Severe laws were made against taking interest for mo∣ney,
which was then denominated usury<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 5.</NOTE>. Even the
profits of exchange were prohibited, as savouring of
usury<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. 6.</NOTE>, which the superstition of that age zealously pro∣scribed.
All evasive contracts, by which profits could be
made from the loan of money, were also carefully guarded
against<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">7 H. 7. cap. 8.</NOTE>. It is needless to observe how unreasonable
and iniquitous these laws, how impossible to be executed,
and how hurtful to trade, if they could take place. We
may observe, however, to the praise of this King, that
sometimes, in order to promote commerce, he lent to
merchants sums of money, without interest; when he
knew, that their stock was not sufficient for those enter∣prizes,
which they had in view<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Polyd. Virg.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LAWS were made against the exportation of money,
plate, or bullion<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">4 H. 7. cap. 23.</NOTE>: A precaution, which serves to no
<PB N="423" REF="445"/>
other purpose than to make more be exported. But so
far was the anxiety on this head carried, that merchant
aliens, who imported commodities into the kingdom,
were obliged to invest, in English commodities, all the
money acquired by their sales, in order to prevent their
conveying it away in a clandestine manner<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HORSES were forbid to be exported; as if that ex∣portation
did not encourage the breed, and render them
more plentiful in the kingdom<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">11 H. 7. cap. 13.</NOTE>. To promote archery,
no bows were to be sold at a higher price than six shil∣lings
and four-pence<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 12.</NOTE>, reducing money to the denomi∣nation
of our time. The only effect of this regulation
must be either that the people would be supplied with bad
bows or none at all. Prices were also affixed to woollen
cloath<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">4 H. 7. cap. 8.</NOTE>, to caps and hats<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid, cap. 9.</NOTE>: And labourers wages were
regulated by law<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">II H. 7. cap. 22.</NOTE>. It is evident, that these circum∣stances
ought always to be left free, and be trusted to the
common course of business and commerce. To some it
may appear surprizing, that the price of a yard of scar∣let
cloth should be limited to six and twenty shillings, that
of a yard of coloured cloth to eighteen; higher prices
than these commodities bear at present: And that the
wages of a tradesman, such as a mason, bricklayer, tyler,
&amp;c. should be regulated at near ten-pence a day; which
is not much inferior to the present wages given in some
places of England. Labour and commodities have cer∣tainly
risen very much since the discovery of the West-Indies;
but not so much in every particular as is general∣ly
imagined. The greater industry of the present times
has encreased the number of tradesmen and labourers, so
as to keep wages nearer a par than could be expected
<PB N="424" REF="446"/>
from the great encrease of gold and silver. And the ad∣ditional
art employed in the finer manufactures, has
even made some of these commodities fall below their
former value. Not to mention, that merchants and
dealers, being contented with less profit than formerly,
afford the goods cheaper to their customers. It appears
by a statute of this reign<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">4 H. 7. cap. 9.</NOTE>, that goods bought for six∣teen
pence would sometimes be sold by the merchants
for three shillings. The commodities, whose price has
chiefly risen, are butchers meat, fowl, and fish, (espe∣cially
the latter) which cannot be much augmented in
quantity by the encrease of art and industry. The pro∣fession
which then abounded most, and was embraced by
persons of the lowest rank, was the church: By a clause
of a statute, all clerks or students of the university were
forbid to beg, without a permission from the vice-chan∣cellor<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">11 H. 7. cap. 22.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ONE great cause of the low state of industry during
this period, was the restraints put upon it; and the par∣liament,
or rather the King, (for he was the prime
mover in every thing) enlarged a little some of these li∣mitations;
but not to the degree that was requisite. A
law had been enacted during the reign of Henry the
fourth<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">7 H. 7. cap. 17.</NOTE>, that no man could bind his son or daughter to
an apprenticeship, unless he was possessed of twenty shil∣lings
a year in land; and Henry the seventh, because
the decay of manufactures was complained of in Norwich
from the want of hands, exempted that city from the
penalties of this law<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">11 H. 7. cap. 11.</NOTE>. Afterwards, the whole county of
Norfolk obtained a like exemption with regard to some
branches of the woollen manufacture<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">12 H. 7. cap. 1.</NOTE>. These absurd
<PB N="425" REF="447"/>
limitations proceeded from a desire of promoting hus∣bandry,
which however is never more effectually encour∣aged
than by the encrease of manufactures. For a like
reason, the law enacted against inclosures, and for the
keeping up farm houses<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">4 H. 7. cap. 19.</NOTE>, scarce deserves the high praises
bestowed on it by lord Bacon. If husbandmen under∣stood
agriculture, and have a ready vent for their com∣modities,
we need never dread a diminution of the people,
employed in the country. All methods of supporting po∣pulousness,
except by the interest of the proprietors, are
violent and ineffectual. During a century and a half after
this period, there was a continual renewal of laws and
edicts against depopulation; whence we may infer, that
none of them were ever executed. The natural course
of improvement at last provided a remedy.</P>
<P>ONE great check to industry in England was the
erecting corporations; an abuse which is not yet entirely
corrected. A law was enacted, that corporations should
not pass any by-laws without the consent of three of
the chief officers of state<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">19 H. 7. cap. 7.</NOTE>. They were prohibited to
impose tolls at their gates<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. 8.</NOTE>. The cities of Glocester
and Worcester had even imposed tolls on the Severne,
which were abolished<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. 18.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE is a law of this reign<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">12 H. 7. cap. 6.</NOTE>, containing a pre∣amble,
from which it appears, that the company of
merchant adventurers in London, had, by their own
authority, debarred all the other merchants of the king∣dom,
from trading to the great marts in the Low Coun∣tries,
unless each trader previously payed them the sum
of near seventy pounds. It is surprising that such a by-law
(if it deserves that name) could ever be carried into
<PB N="426" REF="448"/>
execution, and that the authority of parliament should
be requisite to abrogate it.</P>
<P>IT was during this reign, on the second of August
1492, a little before sun-set, that Christopher Columbus,
a Florentine, set out from Cadiz on his memorable voy∣age
for the discovery of the western world; and a few
years after, Vasquez de Gama, a Portuguese, passed the
Cape of Good Hope, and opened a new passage to the East Indies.
These great events were attended with the
most important consequences to all the nations of Eu∣rope,
even to such as were not immediately concerned in
those naval enterprizes. The enlargement of commerce
and navigation encreased industry and the arts every
where: The nobles dissipated their fortunes in expensive
pleasures: Men of an inferior rank both acquired a share
in the landed property, and created to themselves a con∣siderable
property of a new kind, in stock, commodities,
art, credit, and correspondence. In some nations the
privileges of the commons encreased, by this encrease of
property: In most nations, the Kings, finding arms to
be dropt by the barons, who could no longer endure their
former rude manner of life, established standing armies,
and mastered the liberties of the kingdom: But in all
places, the condition of the people, from the depression of
the petty tyrants, by whom they had formerly been op∣pressed,
rather than governed, received great improve∣ment,
and they acquired, if not entire liberty, at least
the most considerable advantages of it. And as the ge∣neral
course of events thus tended to depress the nobles
and exalt the people, Henry the seventh, who also em∣braced
that system of policy, has acquired more praise,
than his institutions, strictly speaking, seem of them∣selves
to deserve, on account of any profound wisdom
attending them.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="449"/>
IT was by accident only, that the King had not a
considerable hand in those great naval discoveries, by
which the present age was so much distinguished. Co∣lumbus,
after meeting many repulses from the courts of
Portugal and Spain, sent his brother Bartholomew into
England, in order to explain his projects to Henry, and
crave his protection for the execution of them. Henry
invited him to England; but his brother, in returning
to Spain, being taken by pyrates, was detained in
his voyage; and Columbus, meanwhile, having obtained
the countenance of Isabella, was supplied with a small
fleet, and happily executed his enterprize. Henry was
not discouraged by this disappointment: He fitted out
Sebastian Cabot, a Venetian, dwelling in Bristol; and
sent him westwards in 1498 in search of new countries.
Cabot discovered the main land of America towards the
sixtieth degree of northern latitude: He sailed south∣wards
along the coast, and discovered Newfoundland,
and other countries: But returned to England, without
making any conquest or settlement. Elliot and other
merchants in Bristol made a like attempt in 1502<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xiii. p. 37.</NOTE>.
The King expended fourteen thousand pounds in build∣ing
one ship called the <HI>Great Harry</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 484.</NOTE>. This was, pro∣perly
speaking, the first ship in the English navy. Be∣fore
this period, when the prince wanted a fleet, he
had no other expedient but hiring ships from the mer∣chants.</P>
<P>BUT though this improvement of navigation, and the
discovery of both the Indies, was the most memorable
incident that happened during this or any other period,
it was not the only great event by which the age was
distinguished. In 1453, Constantinople was taken by
the Turks; and the Greeks, among whom some remains

of learning were still preserved, being scattered by these
Barbarians, took shelter in Italy, and imported, to∣gether
with their admirable language, a tincture of their
science and their refined taste in poetry and eloquence.
About the same time, the purity of the Latin tongue was
revived, the study of antiquity became fashionable, and
the esteem for literature gradually propagated itself
throughout every nation of Europe. The art of printing,
invented about that time, facilitated extremely the pro∣gress
of all these improvements: The invention of gun∣powder
changed the whole art of war: Mighty innova∣tions
were soon after made in religion, such as not only
affected those states that embraced them, but even those
that adhered to the antient faith and worship: And thus
a general revolution was made in human affairs through∣out
this part of the world; and men gradually attained
that situation, with regard to commerce, arts, sciences,
government, police, and cultivation, in which they have
ever since persevered. Here therefore commences the
useful, as well as the most agreeable part of modern
annals; certainty has place in all the considerable, and
even most of the minute parts of historical narration; a
great variety of events, preserved by printing, give the
author the power of selecting, as well as adorning, the
facts, which he relates; and as each incident has a re∣ference
to our present manners and situation, instructive
lessons occur every moment during the course of the
narration. Whoever carries his anxious researches into
preceding periods is moved by a curiosity, liberal in∣deed
and commendable; not by any necessity for ac∣quiring
a knowledge of public affairs, or the arts of
civil government.</P>

<P>THE death of Henry the Seventh had been attended
with as open and visible a joy among the people as
decency would permit;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXVII.</NOTE> and the accession and coronation
of his son, Henry the Eighth, spread universally a declar∣ed
and unfeigned satisfaction.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Popularity of the new King.</NOTE> Instead of a monarch,
jealous, severe, and avaritious, who, in proportion as he
advanced in years, was sinking still deeper in those unpo∣pular
vices; a young prince of eighteen had succeeded
to the throne, who, even in the eyes of men of sense,
gave very promising hopes of his future conduct, much
more in those of the people, always enchanted with no∣velty,
youth, and royal dignity. The beauty and vi∣gour
of his person, accompanied with dexterity in every
manly exercise, was farther adorned with a blooming
and ruddy countenance, with a lively air, with the ap∣pearance
<PB N="430" REF="454"/>
of spirit and activity in all his demeanour<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">T. Mori, Lucubr. p. 182.</NOTE>.
His father, in order to remove him from the knowledge
of public business, had hitherto occupied him entirely in
the study of literature; and the proficiency, which he
made, gave no bad prognostic of his parts and capacity<SUP>b</SUP>.<NOTE PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 1.</NOTE>.
Even the vices of vehemence, ardour, and impatience,
to which he was subject, and which afterwards degene∣rated
into tyranny, were considered only as faults, inci∣dent
to unguarded youth, which would be corrected,
when time had brought him to greater moderation and
maturity. And as the contending titles of York and
Lancaster were now at last fully united in his person,
men justly expected from a prince, obnoxious to no
party, that impartiality of administration, which had so
long been unknown in England.</P>
<P>THE favourable prepossessions of the public were en∣couraged
by the measures, which Henry embraced in the
commencement of his reign. His grandmother, the
countess of Richmond and Derby, was still alive; and
as she was a woman much celebrated for prudence and
virtue, he very wisely shewed great deference to her opi∣nion
in the establishment of his new council.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His ministors.</NOTE> The mem∣bers
were Warham, archbishop of Canterbury, and
chancellor; the earl of Shrewsbury, steward; lord Her∣bert,
chamberlain; Sir Thomas Lovel, master of the
wards and constable of the Tower; Sir Edward Poyn∣ings,
knight of the garter, comptroller; Sir Henry Mar∣ney,
afterwards lord Marney; Sir Thomas Darcy,
afterwards lord Darcy; Thomas Ruthal, doctor of
laws; and Sir Henry Wyat<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Herbert, Stowe, p. 486. Hollingshed, p. 799.</NOTE>. These men had long
been accustomed to business under the late King, and
<PB N="431" REF="455"/>
were the least unpopular of all the ministers employed
by that monarch.</P>
<P>BUT the chief competitors for favour and authority
under the new King were the earl of Surrey, treasurer,
and Fox, bishop of Winchester, secretary and privy seal.
This prelate, who enjoyed great credit during all the
former reign, had acquired such habits of caution and
frugality as he could not easily lay aside; and he still op∣posed,
by his remonstrances, those schemes of dissipation
and expence, which the youth and passions of Henry
rendered agreeable to him. But Surrey was a more dex∣terous
courtier; and tho' few had borne a greater share
in the frugal politics of the last King, he knew how to
conform himself to the humours of his new master; and
no one was so forward in promoting that liberality, plea∣sure,
and magnificence, which began to prevail under the
young monarch<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert.</NOTE>. By this policy he ingratiated himself with Henry; he made profit, as well as the other cour∣tiers,
of the lavish disposition of his master; and he en∣gaged
him in such a course of play and idleness as ren∣dered
him negligent of affairs, and willing to entrust the
government of the state entirely into the hands of his
ministers. The immense treasures, amassed by the late
King, were gradually dissipated in the giddy expences
of Henry. One party of pleasure succeeded to another:
Tilts, tournaments and carousals were exhibited with all
the magnificence of that age: And as the present tran∣quillity
of the public permitted the court to indulge itself
in every amusement, serious business was but little at∣tended
to. Or if the King intermitted the course of
his festivity, he employed himself chiefly in an applica∣tion
to music and literature, which were his favourite
<PB N="432" REF="456"/>
pursuits, and which were well adapted to his genius.
He had made such proficiency in the former art, as even
to compose some pieces of church-music which were
sung in his chapel<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert.</NOTE>. He was initiated in the elegant
learning of the ancients. And tho' he was so unfor∣tunate
as to be seduced into a study of the barren con∣troversies
of the schools, which were then fashionable,
and had chosen Thomas Aquinas for his favourite au∣thor,
he still discovered a capacity fitted for more useful
and entertaining knowledge.</P>
<P>THE frank and careless humour of the King, as it
led him to dissipate the treasures, amassed by his father,
rendered him negligent in protecting the instruments,
whom that prince had employed in his extortions. A
proclamation being issued to encourage complaints, the
rage of the people was let loose on all the informers,
who had so long exercised an unbounded tyranny over
the nation<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Herbert, Stowe, p. 486. Hollingshed, p. 799. Polyd. Virg. lib. 27.</NOTE>: They were thrown into prison, condemned
to the pillory, and most of them lost their lives by
the violence of the populace.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Punish∣ment
of Empson and Dud∣ley.</NOTE> Empson and Dudley, who
were most exposed to public hatred, were immediately
cited before the council, in order to answer for their
conduct, which had rendered them so obnoxious. Emp∣son
made a shrewd apology for himself, as well as for
his associate. He told the council, that so far from his
being justly obnoxious to censure for his past conduct,
his enemies themselves grounded their clamour on ac∣tions,
which seemed rather to merit reward and approba∣tion:
That a strict execution of law was the crime, of
which he and Dudley were accused; tho' that law
<PB N="433" REF="457"/>
had been established by the voluntary consent of the
people, and tho' they had acted in obedience to the
King, to whom the administration of justice was
entrusted by the constitution: That it belonged not
to them, who were instruments in the hands of
the supreme power, to determine what laws were
recent or obsolete, expedient or hurtful; since they
were all alike valid, so long as they remained unrepealed
by the legislature: That it was natural for a licentious
populace to murmur against the restraints of authority;
but all wise states had ever made their glory to consist
in the just distribution of reward and punishment, and
had annexed the former to the observance and enforce∣ment
of the laws, the latter to their violation and infrac∣tion:
And that a sudden overthrow of all government
might be expected; where the judges were committed
to the mercy of the criminals, the rulers to that of the
subjects<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Herbert, Hollingshed, p. 804.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this defence, Empson and Dud∣ley
were sent to the Tower; and soon after brought to
their trial. The strict execution of laws, however ob∣solete, could never be imputed to them as a crime in a
court of judicature; and it is likely, that even where they
had exercised arbitrary power, the King, as they had
acted by the secret commands of his father, was not
willing that their conduct should undergo too severe a
scrutiny. In order, therefore, to gratify the people with
the punishment of these obnoxious ministers, crimes
very improbable, or indeed absolutely impossible, were
charged upon them, that they had entered into a
conspiracy against the King, and had intended, on
the death of the late King, to have seized by
<PB N="434" REF="458"/>
force the administration of the government. The jury
were so far moved by popular prejudices, joined to
court influence, as to give a verdict against them; which
was afterwards confirmed by a bill of attainder in par∣liament<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">This Parliament met on the 21st January, 15<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0. A law was there enacted, in order to prevent some abuses which had prevailed during the late reign. The forfeiture upon the penal statutes was reduced to the term of three years. Costs and damages were given against infor∣mers upon acquittal of the accused: More severe punishments were enacted against perjury: The false inquisitions procured by Empson and Dudley were declared null and invalid. Traverses were allowed; and the time of tendering them enlarged. 1 H. 8. c. 8. 10, 11, 12.</NOTE>,
and, at the earnest desire of the people, was
executed by warrant from the King. Thus, in those
arbitrary times, justice was equally violated, whether the
King sought power and riches, or courted popularity.</P>
<P>THE King, while he punished the instruments of past
tyranny, had yet such deference to former engagements
as to d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>berate, immediately after his accession, concern∣ing
the consummation of his marriage with the infanta
Catherine, to whom he was affianced during his father's
lifetime.<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's marriage.</NOTE> Her former marriage with his brother, and
the inequality of their years, were the chief objections,
which were urged against the espousing her: But on the
other hand, the advantages of her known virtue, modesty, and
sweetness of disposition were insisted on; the affection
which she bore the King; the large dowry to which she
was entitled as princess of Wales; the interest of ce∣menting
a close alliance with Spain; the necessity of
finding some confederate to counterbalance the power
of France; the expediency of fulfilling the engage∣ments
of the late King. When these considerations
were weighed, they determined the council, tho' con∣trary
to the opinion of the primate, to give Henry their
<PB N="435" REF="459"/>
advice for compleating the marriage; which was done ac∣cordingly.
The countess of Richmond, who had con∣curred
in the same sentiments, died soon after the mar∣riage
of her grandson.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE popularity of Henry's government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1510.</NOTE> his indisputed
title to the throne, his extensive authority, his large trea∣sures,
the tranquillity of his subjects, were circumstances
which rendered his domestic administration easy and pros∣perous:
The situation of foreign affairs was no less hap∣py
and desirable.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foreign af∣fairs.</NOTE> Italy continued still, as during the late
reign, to be the center of all the wars and negotiations of
the European princes; and Henry's alliance was courted
by both sides; at the same time, that he was not engaged
by any immediate interest or necessity to take part with
either. Lewis the Twelfth of France, after the con∣quest
of Milan, was the only great prince who possessed
any territory in Italy; and could he have remained in
tranquillity, he was enabled by his situation to prescribe
laws to all the Italian princes and republics, and to hold
the balance among them. But the desire of making a
conquest of Naples, to which he had the same title or
pretension with his predecessor, still engaged him in new
enterprizes; and as he foresaw opposition from Ferdi∣nand,
who was connected both by treaties and affinity
with Frederic of Naples, he endeavoured, by the offers
of interest, to which the ears of that monarch were ever
open, to engage him in an opposite confederacy. He
settled with him a plan for the partition of the kingdom
of Naples and the expulsion of Frederic: A plan,
which the politicians of that age regarded as the most
egregious imprudence in the French monarch, and the
basest treachery in the Spanish. Frederic, supported only
by subjects, who were either discontented with his go∣vernment,
<PB N="436" REF="460"/>
or indifferent about his fortunes, was unable
to resist so powerful a confederacy, and was deprived of
his dominions: But he had the satisfaction to see Naples
immediately prove the source of contention among his
enemies. Ferdinand gave secret orders to his general,
Gonsalvo, whom the Spaniards honour with the appella∣tion
of the <HI>great captain,</HI> to attack the armies of France, and
make himself master of all the dominions of Naples.
Gonsalvo prevailed in every enterprize, defeated the
French in two pitched battles, and ensured to his
prince the entire possession of that kingdom. Lewis,
unable to procure redress by force of arms, was obliged
to enter into a fruitless negotiation with Ferdinand for
the recovery of his share of the partition; and all Italy,
during some time, was held in suspence between these
two powerful monarchs.</P>
<P>THERE scarce has been any period, when the ba∣lance
of power was bettter secured in Europe, and
seemed more able to maintain itself, without any anxious
concern or attention of the princes. Several great mo∣narchies
were established; and no one so far surpassed
the rest as to give any foundation, or even pretence, for
jealousy. England was united in domestic peace, and
by its situation happily secured from the invasion of
foreigners. The coalition of the several kingdoms of
Spain, had formed one powerful monarchy, which Fer∣dinand
administered with arts fraudulent indeed and de∣ceitful,
but full of vigour and ability. Lewis the
Twelfth of France, a gallant and generous prince, by
espousing Anne of Brittany, widow to his predecessor, had
preserved the union with that principality, on which the
safety of his kingdom so much depended. Maximilian,
the emperor, besides the hereditary dominions of the Au∣strian
family, maintained authority in the empire, and
<PB N="437" REF="461"/>
notwithstanding his levity of disposition, was able to unite
the German princes in any great plan of interest, at least,
of defence. Charles, prince of Castile, grandson to
Maximilian and Ferdinand, had already succeeded to
the rich dominions of the house of Burgundy; and being
as yet in early youth, the government was entrusted
to Margaret of Savoy, his aunt, a princess endowed
with signal prudence and virtue. The internal force
of these several powerful states, which balanced each
other, might long have maintained general tranquillity,
had not the active and enterprizing genius of an ambi∣tious
pontiff first excited the slames of war and discord
among them.</P>
<P>ALEXANDER the Sixth was dead; a man of a singu∣lar
character,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Julius the Second.</NOTE> and, excepting his son Caesar Borgia, al∣most
the only man we read of in history, who has
joined great capacity with the blackest vices and the most
abandoned profligacy of manners. After a short inter∣val,
Julius the Second had succeeded to the papal throne,
who tho' endowed with many virtues, gave almost as
much scandal to the world as his detested predecessor.
His virtues were deemed unsuitable to his station of sove∣reign
pontiff, the spiritual judge and common father of
all Christians. Animated with an unextinguishable thirst
of glory, inflexible in his schemes, undaunted in his en∣terprizes,
indefatigable in his pursuits; magnanimous,

was to overwhelm, by their united arms, the
commonwealth of Venice.</P>
<P>THIS illustrious commonwealth, the great bulwark of
Europe against the barbarians, and the admired model
of civil polity, had risen to a considerable power, and
began to make a figure, which during that age bore
some proportion to that of the great monarchies. Her
riches surpassed those of any European city, her finances
were great, her commerce extensive, her naval power
formidable, her armies numerous and well supplied.
Trusting only to her own power, she had neglected
to maintain a cordial friendship with any other state;
and by the endless political suspicions, which she enter∣tained
even of her best allies, she had taught them to
regard her progress with like jealousy. No state
could reasonably complain of any injustice and usur∣pations
in her measures: But as great monarchs ne∣ver
see without displeasure a republic nearly on a
a level with themselves, it was easy for Julius, by his
negotiations among the European princes, to compleat
his scheme of a confederacy against her. Ferdinand
desired to wrest from the Venetians some towns on the
coast of Naples, which his predecessor had voluntarily,
for money, consigned into their hand: Lewis proposed
to recover a part of the territory of Milan, which he
himself had delivered to them by treaty: Maximilian
laid claim to great part of their dominions, which they
had acquired from petty princes or tyrants, that had

challenged another part of their dominions, as
the pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rimony of the church. In order to cover the
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cheme of this confederacy, the cardinal d'Amboise,
prime minister of France, had met at Cambray with
<PB N="439" REF="465"/>
Margaret of Savoy, under colour of accommodating a
difference between her and the duke of Guelders; and
it was there, that the alliance against Venice was se∣cretly
signed by the contracting powers, and all the
measures of operation concerted<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 8. Bembo.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Venetians were apprised of their danger, and
prepared themselves for resistance. They provided eve∣ry
means of defence, except the most essential, brave
and warlike forces, which it is impossible to raise, where
the ideas of military glory are extinguished, and men
have, from long habit, acquired other objects of ambi∣tion.
They sent into the field an army of 40,000 men
under experienced leaders, the count of Pitigliano and
Bartholomew Alviano; and hoped, that so great a force
would secure them from the invasion of Lewis, who had
led an army into Italy, and first took the field against
them. But the martial nobility of France, headed by
their gallant sovereign, utterly discomfitted these enervat∣ed
forces; and in the action of Ghierradadda, the power
and glory of Venice, the result of consummate wisdom,
and the work of ages, suffered in one day a check,
which it has never yet been able thoroughly to recover<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Seissel. hist. Louis XII. St. Gela <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Guicciard. lib. 8.</NOTE>.
Dismayed with this loss, the Venetians took a hasty re∣solution
of abandoning all their dominions on the con∣tinent
of Italy; and they accordingly withdrew their
garrisons from every place, and freed their subjects from
their oaths of allegiance. Lewis immediately put him∣self
in possession of Cremona, Bergamo, Brescia, Creme,
and all the places which had been dismembered from
the Milanese. Even Verona, Padua, Vicenza, and
other towns, which, by the treaty of Cambray, fell
<PB N="440" REF="466"/>
under the partition of Maximilian, offered to open their
gates to the French monarch. Had Maximilian, instead
of wasting his time at Trent, led his forces early into
Italy, an end had been put for ever to the power and do∣minion
of Venice. But Lewis, well acquainted with
the fickleness and inconstancy of that prince, was deter∣mined
to give him no pretext for deserting his alliance;
and therefore ordered the magistrates of those towns to
make their submissions to the emperor, whom, he told
them, they were now to regard as their lawful sovereign<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Buonacorsi, Petrus de Angleria, epist. 418.</NOTE>.
The Venetian senate, observing those delays, and re∣marking
the extreme regret, which their subjects dis∣covered
on losing the mild and equitable government of
the republic<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Guicciard. lib. 8.</NOTE>, began again to assume courage, and rein∣stated
themselves in the dominion of those cities, which
they had abandoned. From this time, their prudence
and sound policy gave a check to the malignity of their
fortune and the superiority of their enemies. They vo∣luntarily
made a sacrifice to Ferdinand of those towns,
which he laid claim to, and thereby detached him from
the alliance<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Petrus de Angleria.</NOTE>. They gratified the ambition of the Pope
by a like sacrifice; and farther flattered his vanity by the
lowest obeisance and the most dutiful submissions<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Bembo.</NOTE>.
After trying like arts with Maximilian, and finding his
pretensions to be utterly exorbitant, they rouzed their
patriot spirit, and prepared themselves for resistance, with
a courage, which, tho' ill seconded by the unwarlike
genius of their people, might have done honour to the
Roman senate during the most flourishing period of the
republic.</P>
<P>THE great force and secure situation of the consider∣able
monarchies, prevented any one of them from aspir∣ing
<PB N="441" REF="467"/>
to any conquest of moment; and tho' this con∣sideration
could not maintain general peace, or remedy
the natural inquietude of men, it rendered the princes of
this age more easy in deserting engagements and changing
their alliances, in which they were retained more by hu∣mour
and caprice than by any natural or durable interest.
Julius had no sooner humbled the Venetian republic, than
he was inspired with a nobler ambition, that of expelling
all foreigners from Italy, or, to speak in the stile af∣fcted
by the Italians of that age, the freeing that coun∣try
entirely from the dominion of the Barbarians<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Guicciard. lib. 8.</NOTE>. He
was determined to make the tempest fall first upon Lewis;
and in order to pave the way for this great enterprize, he
at once sought for a ground of quarrel with that mo∣narch,
and courted the alliance of other princes. He
declared war against the duke of Ferrara, the confede∣rate
of Lewis. He solicited the favour of England, by
sending Henry a sacred rose, perfumed with musk and
anointed with chrism<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Spelman, Concil. vol. ii. p. 725.</NOTE>. He engaged in his interest Bam∣bridge
archbishop of York, and Henry's ambassador at
Rome, whom he soon after created cardinal. He drew
over Ferdinand to his side, tho' that monarch, at first,
made no declaration of his intentions. And what he
chiefly valued, he framed a treaty with the Swiss cantons,
who, enraged by some neglects put upon them by Lewis,
accompanied with contumelious expressions, had deserted
the alliance of France, and waited an opportunity of
revenging themselves on that nation.</P>
<P>LEWIS was determined not to abandon the duke of
Ferrara, who suffered merely for his attachment to the
crown of France. Chaumont, his lieutenant in the
Milanese, received orders to defend him against Julius,
<PB N="442" REF="468"/>
who, supported by his own dauntless spirit, and con∣fiding
in the sacredness of his character, had set his ene∣my
at defiance. By a happy and unexpected movement,
Chaumont surrounded the pope and all his court in Bo∣logna;
and had he not allowed himself to be amused by a
treaty, which his profound respect for the holy father
made him the more willing to hearken to, he had been
able, without any bloodshed, to have reduced him to
captivity. Finding himself exposed to severe censure for
not pushing his advantages, he was agitated with such
violent regret, that he fell into a languishing illness, of
which he soon after died; tho' opposite remorses took
place on his death-bed, and he very humbly craved of
his holiness a remission of his grievous sin, in having at
all born arms against him<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">L'abbé du Bos, Histoire de la Ligue de Combray.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE the French monarch repelled the attacks of
his enemies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1511.</NOTE> he thought it also requisite to make an at∣tack
on the pope himself, and to despoil him, as much
as possible, of that sacred character, which chiefly ren∣dered
him formidable. He engaged some cardinals, dis∣gusted
with the violence of Julius, to desert him; and
by their authority, he was determined, in conjunction
with Maximilian, who still adhered to his alliance, to call
a general council, which might reform the church, and
check the exorbitancies of the Roman pontiff. A coun∣cil
Was summoned at Pisa, which from the beginning
bore a very inauspicious aspect, and promised little suc∣cess
to its adherents. Except a few French bishops,
who unwillingly obeyed their King's orders in attend∣ing
the council, all the other prelates kept at a distance
from an assembly, which they regarded as the offspring
of faction, intrigue, and worldly politics. Even Pisa,
<PB N="443" REF="469"/>
the place of their residence, showed them signs of con∣tempt;
which engaged them to transfer their session to
Milan, a town under the dominion of the French mo∣narch.
Notwithstanding this advantage, they did not
experience much more respectful treatment from the
inhabitants of Milan; and found it necessary to make
another remove to Lyons<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 10.</NOTE>. Lewis himself fortified
these violent prejudices in favour of the papal authority,
by the symptoms, which he discovered, of regard, de∣ference,
and submission to Julius, whom he always spared,
even when fortune had thrown into his hands the most
inviting opportunities of humbling him. And as it was
known, that his consort, who had great authority with
him, was extremely disquieted in mind, on account of
his dissentions with the holy father, all men prognosti∣cated
to Julius final success in this unequal contest.</P>
<P>THAT enterprizing pope knew his advantages, and
availed himself of them with the utmost temerity and
insolence. So much had he neglected his pontifical cha∣racter,
that he assisted in person at the siege of Miran∣dola,
visited the trenches, saw some of his attendants
killed by his side, and, like a young soldier, chearfully
bore all the rigours of winter and a severe season, in
pursuit of military glory<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. lib. 9.</NOTE>: Yet was he still able to
throw, even on his most moderate opponents, the charge
of impiety and prophaneness. He summoned a council
at the Lateran: He put Pisa under an interdict, and al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the places which gave shelter to the schismatical council:
He excommunicated the cardinals and prelates who at∣tended
it: He even directed his spiritual thunders against
the princes who adhered to it: He freed their subjects
from all oaths of allegiance, and gave their dominions to
every one, who could take possession of them.</P>

FERDINAND of Arragon, who had acquired the sir∣name
of the Catholic, regarded the cause of the pope
and of religion only as a cover to his ambition and self∣ish
politics: Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1512.</NOTE> naturally sincere and sanguine in
his temper, and the more so on account of his youth
and inexperience, was moved with a hearty desire of
protecting the pope from that oppression, to which he be∣lieved
him exposed from the ambitious enterprizes of
Lewis. Hopes had been given him by Julius, that the
title of the <HI>most Christian King,</HI> which had hitherto been
annexed to the crown of France, and which was regarded
as its most precious ornament, would, in reward of his
services, be transferred to that of England<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Guicciard. lib. xi. P. Daniel, vol. ii. p. 1893. Herbert, Hol∣lingshed, p. 831.</NOTE>. Impatient
also of acquiring that distinction in Europe, to which his
power and opulence entitled him, he could not long re∣main
neuter amidst the noise of arms; and the natural
enmity of the English against France, as well as their
antient claims upon that kingdom, led Henry to join
that alliance which the pope, Spain, and Venice had
formed against the French monarch. A herald was sent
to Paris, to exhort Lewis not to wage impious war
against the pope; and when he returned without success,
another was sent to make a demand of the antient pa∣trimonial
provinces, Anjou, Maine, Guienne, and Nor∣mandy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France. 4th of Fe∣bruary.</NOTE>
This message was understood as a declaration
of war; and a parliament, being summoned, readily
granted supplies for a purpose so much favoured by the
English nation<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Holingshed, p. 811.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUONAVISO, an agent of the pope at London, had
been corrupted by the court of France, and had previ∣ously
revealed to Lewis all the measures which Henry
was concerting against him. But this infidelity did the
<PB N="445" REF="471"/>
King inconsiderable prejudice, in comparison of what he
experienced from the selfish purposes of the ally, to
whom he chiefly trusted for assistance. Ferdinand, his
father-in-law, had so long persevered in a course of crook∣ed
politics, that he began even to value himself on his
dexterity in fraud and artifice; and he made a boast of
those shameful successes. Being told one day, that Lewis
the twelfth, a prince of a very different character, had
complained that he had once cheated him: “He lies,
the drunkard!” said he, “I have cheated him above
twenty times.” This prince considered his close con∣nexion
with Henry, only as the means which enabled
him the better to take advantage of his want of expe∣rience.
He advised him not to invade France by the
way of Calais, where he himself should not have it in
his power to assist him: He exhorted him rather to send
forces to Fontarabia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Expedition to Font∣arabia.</NOTE> whence he could easily make a
conquest of Guienne, a province, in which, it was ima∣gined,
the English had still some adherents. He pro∣mised
to assist this conquest by the junction of a Spanish
army. And so forward did he seem to promote the in∣terest
of his son-in-law, that he even sent vessels into
England, to transport over the forces which Henry had
levied for that purpose. The marquis of Dorset com∣manded
these troops, which consisted of ten thousand
men, mostly infantry; the lord Howard, son to the earl
of Surry, the lord Broke, lord Ferrars, and many others
of the young gentry and nobility, accompanied him in
this service. All were on fire to distinguish themselves
by military atchievements, and to make a conquest of
importance for their master. The secret purpose of Fer∣dinand
in this unexampled generosity was suspected by
no body.</P>
<P>THE small kingdom of Navarre lies on the frontiers
between France and Spain; and as John d'Albert, the
<PB N="446" REF="472"/>
present King, was connected in friendship and alliance
with Lewis, the opportunity seemed favourable to Ferdi∣nand,
while the English forces were conjoined with his
own, and while all adherents to the council of Pisa lay
under the sentence of excommunication, to put himself
in possession of these dominions. No sooner, therefore,
was Dorset landed in Guipiscoa, than the Spanish mo∣narch
declared his readiness to join him with his forces,
to make jointly an invasion of France, and to form the
siege of Bayonne, which opened the way into Guienne<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Hollingshed, p. 813.</NOTE>:
But he remarked to the English general how dangerous
it might prove to leave behind them the kingdom of
Navarre, which, being in close alliance with France,
could easily give admittance to the enemy, and cut off
all communication between Spain and the combined
armies. To provide against so dangerous an event, he
required, that John should stipulate a neutrality in the
present war; and when that prince expressed his willing∣ness
to enter into any engagement for that purpose, he
also required that he should give security for his strict
observance of it. John having likewise agreed to this
condition, Ferdinand demanded, that he should deliver
into his hands six of the most considerable places of his
dominions, together with his eldest son as a hostage.
These were not conditions to be proposed to a sovereign;
and as the Spanish monarch expected a refusal, he gave
immediate orders to the duke of Alva, his general, to
make an invasion of Navarre, and to reduce the whole
kingdom to subjection. Alva soon made himself master
of all the smaller towns; and being ready to form the
siege of Pampeluna, the capital, he summoned the mar∣quis
of Dorset to join him with the English army, and
to concert together all their operations.</P>
<P><PB N="447" REF="473"/>
DORSET began to suspect, that his master's interests
were very little regarded in all these transactions; and
having no orders to invade the kingdom of Navarre, or
make war any where but in France, he refused to take
any part in that enterprize.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deceit of Ferdinand.</NOTE> He remained therefore in his
quarters at Fontarabia; but so politic was the contrivance
of Ferdinand, that even while the English army lay in
that situation, it was almost equally serviceable to his
purposes, as if it had acted in conjunction with his own.
It kept the French army in awe, and prevented it from
advancing to succour the kingdom of Navarre; so that
Alva, having full leisure to conduct the siege, made him∣self
master of Pampeluna, and obliged John to seek for
shelter in France. The Spanish general applied again to
Dorset, and proposed to conduct with united councils the
operations of the <HI>holy league,</HI> so it was called, against
Lewis: But as he still declined forming the siege of
Bayonne, and rather insisted on the invasion of the prin∣cipality
of Bearne, a part of the King of Navarre's do∣minions,
which lies on the French side of the Pyrenees,
Dorset, justly suspicious of his sinister intentions, repre∣sented,
that, without new orders from his master, he
could not concur in such an undertaking. In order to
procure such orders, Ferdinand dispatched Martin de
Ampios, as his envoy, to London; and persuaded
Henry, that, by the refractory and scrupulous humour of
the English general, the most favourable opportunities
were lost, and that it was necessary he should, in all
things, act in concert with the Spanish commander,
who was best acquainted with the situation of the coun∣try,
and the reasons of every operation. But before or∣ders
to this purpose reached Spain, Dorset had become
extremely impatient; and observing that his farther stay
served not to promote the main undertaking, and that his
army was daily perishing by want and sickness, he de∣manded
<PB N="448" REF="474"/>
shipping from Ferdinand to transport them back
into England. Ferdinand, who was bound by treaty to
furnish him with this supply, whenever demanded, was
at last, after many delays, obliged to yield to his impor∣tunity;
and Dorset, embarking his troops, prepared
himself for the voyage.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Return of the English.</NOTE> Meanwhile, a messenger ar∣river
with orders from Henry, that the troops should
remain in Spain; but the soldiers were so discontented
with the treatment which they had met with, that they
mutinied, and obliged their commanders to set sail for
England. Henry was much displeased with the ill suc∣cess
of this enterprize; and it was with difficulty, that
Dorset, by explaining the fraudulent intentions of Fer∣dinand,
was at last able to appease him.</P>
<P>THERE happened this summer an action at sea, which
brought not any more decisive advantage to the English.
Sir Thomas Knevet, master of horse, was sent to the
coast of Brittany with a fleet of forty-five sail; and he
carried with him Sir Charles Brandon, Sir John Carew,
and many other young courtiers, who longed for an op∣portunity
of displaying their valour. After committing
some depredations, a French sleet of thirty-nine sail
issued from Brest, under the command of Primauget<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Or rather Porsmauget, according to P. Daniel's conjecture, vol. ii. p. 1901. Hence the English seamen called him Sir Pierce Morgan.</NOTE>,
and began an engagement with the English. Primau∣get's
ship was set on fire, who finding hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> destruction in∣evitable,
bore down upon the vessel of the English ad∣miral,
and grappling with her, resolved to make her
share the same fate. The ships of both fleets stood for
some time in suspence, as spectators of this dreadful en∣gagement;
and all men saw with horror the flames which
consumed both vessels, and heard the cries of fury and
despair which came from the miserable combatants. At
<PB N="449" REF="475"/>
last, the French vessel blew up; and at the same time
destroyed the English<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 17. Stowe, p. 490. Lanqnet's epitome of chronicles, fol. 273.</NOTE>. The rest of the French fleet
made their escape into different har<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ours.</P>
<P>THE war, which England waged against France,
though it brought little advantage to the former kingdom,
was of infinite prejudice to the latter; and by obliging
Lewis to withdraw his forces for the defence of his own
dominions, lost him that superiority, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> his arms, in
the beginning of the campaign, had attained in Italy.
Gaston de Foix, his nephew, a young hero, had been
entrusted with the command of the French forces; and
in a few months performed such feats of military art and
prowess, as were sufficient to render illustrious the whole
life of the oldest captain<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Guicciard. lib. 10.</NOTE>. His career finished with the
great battle of Ravenna, which, after the most obstinate
conflict, he gained over the Spanish and papal armies.
He perished the very moment his victory way compleat;
and with him perished the fortune of the French arms
in Italy. The Swiss, who had rendered themselves ex∣tremely
formidable by their bands of disciplined infantry,
invaded the Milanese with a numerous army, and raised
up that inconstant people to a revolt against the domi∣nion
of France. Genoa followed the example of that
dutchy; and thus Lewis, in a few weeks, entirely lost
his Italian conquests,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1513.</NOTE> except some garrisons; and Maxi∣milian
Sforza, the son of Ludovic, was again re-instated
in possession of Milan.</P>
<P>JULIUS discovered extreme joy on the discomfiture of
the French; and the more so, as he had been beholden
for it to the Swiss, a people, whose councils, he hoped,
<PB N="450" REF="476"/>
he should always be able to govern and direct. The pon∣tiff
survived this success a very little time; and in his
place was chosen John de Medici, who took the appella∣tion
of Leo the tenth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21st of Fe∣bruary. Leo the tenth.</NOTE> and proved one of the most illustri∣ous
princes that ever sat on that throne. Humane, be∣neficent,
generous, affable; the patron of every art, and
friend of every virtue<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 1.</NOTE>; he had a soul no less capable of
forming great designs than his predecessor, but was more
gentle, pliant, and artful in employing means for the
execution of them. By his negotiations, the emperor
Maximilian was detached from the French interest; and
Henry, notwithstanding his disappointments in the for∣mer
campaign, was still encouraged to prosecute his
warlike measures against Lewis.</P>
<P>HENRY hud summoned a new session of parliament<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">4th of November, 1512.</NOTE>,
and obtained a supply for his enterprize.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A parlia∣ment.</NOTE> It was a poll∣tax,
and imposed different sums, according to the sta∣tion
and riches of the person. A duke payed ten marks,
an earl five pounds, a lord four pounds, a knight four
marks; every man valued at eight hundred pounds in
goods, four marks. An imposition was also granted of
two fifteenths and four tenths<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Stowe.</NOTE>. With these supplies,
joined to the treasure which had been left by his father,
and which was not yet entirely dissipated, he was enabled
to levy a great army, and render himself very formidable
to his enemy. The English are said to have been much
encouraged in this enterprize, by the arrival of a vessel
in the Thames under the papal banner. It carried pre∣sents
of wine and hams to the King, and all the most
eminent courtiers; and such fond devotion was at that
time entertained towards the court of Rome, that these
trivial presents were every where received with the great∣est
triumph and exultation.</P>
<P><PB N="451" REF="477"/>
IN order to prevent all disturbance from Scotland,
while Henry's arms should be employed on the continent,
Dr. West, dean of Windsor, was dispatched in an em∣bassy
to James, the King's brother-in-law; and instruc∣tions
were given him to accommodate all differences be∣tween
the kingdoms, as well as to discover the inten∣tions
of the court of Scotland<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.</NOTE>. Some complaints had
already passed on both sides. One Barton, a Scotsman,
having suffered injuries from the Portugueze, for which
he could obtain no redress, had procured letters of marque
against that nation; but he had no sooner got to sea,
than he abused this liberty, committed depredations upon
the English, and much infested the narrow seas<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 489. Hollingshed, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>11.</NOTE>. Lord
Howard and Sir Edward Howard, admirals, and sons to
the earl of Surrey, sailing out against him, fought him
in a desperate rencounter, where the pyrate was killed;
and they brought his ships into the Thames. As Henry
refused all satisfaction for this act of justice, some of
the borderers, who wanted but a pretence for depreda∣tions,
entered England under the command of lord
Hume, warden of the marches, and committed great
ravages on that kingdom. Notwithstanding these mu∣tual
grounds of dissatisfaction, matters might easily have
been accommodated, had it not been for Henry's intended
invasion of France, which rouzed up the jealousy of the
Scottish nation<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Buchannan, lib. 13. Drummond in the life of James IV.</NOTE>. The antient league, which subsisted
between France and Scotland, was conceived to be the
strongest band of connexion; and the Scots universally
believed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with Scotland.</NOTE> that, were it not for the countenance which
they received from this foreign alliance, they had never
been able so long to maintain their independence against
<PB N="452" REF="478"/>
a people so much superior in force and riches. James
was farther incited to take part in the quarrel by the in∣vitations
of Anne, Queen of France, whose knight he
had ever in all tournaments profest himself, and who
summoned him, according to the ideas of romantic gal∣lantry,
prevalent in that age, to take the field in her de∣fence,
and prove himself her true and valorous cham∣pion.
The remonstrances of his consort and of his wisest
counsellors, were in vain opposed to the martial ardour
of that prince. He first sent a squadron of ships to the
assistance of France; the only fleet which Scotland seems
ever to have possessed. And though he made profession
still to maintain a neutrality, the English ambassador
easily foresaw, that a war would prove in the end in∣evitable,
and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e gave warning of the danger to his ma∣ster,
who sent the earl of Surry to put the borders in a
posture of defence, and to resist the invasion of the
enemy.</P>
<P>HENRY, all on fire for military fame, was little dis∣couraged
by this appearance of a diversion from the
North; and so much the less, as he flattered himself
with the assistance of all the considerable potentates of
Europe in his invasion of France. The pope still con∣tinued
to thunder out his excommunications against
Lewis, and all the adherents to the schismatical council:
The Swiss cantons made professions of the most violent
animosity against France: The ambassadors of Ferdinand
and Maximilian had signed with those of Henry a treaty
of alliance against that power, and had ftipulated the
time and place of their intended invasion: And though
Ferdinand disavowed his ambassador, and even signed a
truce for a twelvemonth with the common enemy; Henry
was not yet fully convinced of his selfish and sinister in∣tentions,
and still hoped for his concurrence after the
<PB N="453" REF="479"/>
expiration of that term. He had now got a minister
who complied with all his inclinations, and slattered
him in every scheme to which his sanguine and impetu∣ous
temper was inclined.</P>
<P>THOMAS WOLSEY, dean of Lincoln, and almoner
to the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wolsey mi∣nister.</NOTE> surpassed in favour all his ministers and
courtiers, and was fast advancing towards that unrivalled
grandeur, which he afterwards attained. This man was
the son of a butcher at Ipswich; but having got a learned
education, and being endowed with an excellent capa∣city,
he was admitted into the marquis of Dorset's family
as tutor to that nobleman's children, and soon gained the
friendship and countenance of his patron<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 997.</NOTE>. He was re∣commended
as chaplain to Henry the Seventh, and be∣ing
employed by that monarch in a secret negotiation,
which regarded his intended marriage with Margaret of
Savoy, Maximilian's daughter, he acquitted himself to
the King's satisfaction, and obtained the praise both of
diligence and dexterity in his conduct<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Cavendish, Fiddes's life of Wolsey. Stowe.</NOTE>. That prince
having given him a commission to Maximilian, who at
that time resided in Brussels, was surprized, in less than
three days after, to see Wolsey present himself before
him; and supposing that he had protracted his departure,
he began to reprove him for the dilatory execution of his
orders. Wolsey informed him, that he was just returned
from Brussels, and had successfully fulfilled all his ma∣jesty's commands. “But on second tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghts,” said
the King, “I found that somewhat was omitted in
your orders; and have sent a messenger after you
with fuller instructions.” “I met the messenger,”
replied Wolsey, “on my return: But as I had reflect∣ed
on that omission, I ventured of myself to exe∣cute
<PB N="454" REF="480"/>
what, I knew, must be your majesty's inten∣tions.”
The death of Henry, soon after this incident,
was the reason why Wolsey reaped no advantage from
the good opinion, which that monarch had entertained
of him: But from that moment he was looked on at
court as a rising man; and Fox, bishop of Winchester,
cast his eye upon him as one, who might be serviceable
to him in his present situation<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Antiq. Brit. Eccles, p. 309. Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.</NOTE>. This prelate, observing
that the earl of Surrey had totally eclipsed him in favour,
resolved to introduce Wolsey into the young prince's fa∣miliarity,
and hoped, that he might rival Surrey in his
insinuating arts, and yet be contented to act in the ca∣binet
a part subordinate to Fox himself, who had pro∣moted
him. In a very little time, Wolsey gained so
much on Henry's good graces, that he supplanted both
Surrey in his favour, and Fox in his trust and confidence.
Being admitted to the King's parties of pleasure, he
took the lead in every jovial conversation, and pro∣moted
all that frolic and entertainment, which he found
suitable to the age and inclination of the young monarch.
Neither his own years, which were near forty, nor his
character of a clergyman, were any restraint upon him,
or engaged him to check, by any useless severity, the
gaiety, in which Henry, who had small propension to
debauchery, passed his careless hours. During the in∣tervals
of amusement he introduced business and state
affairs, and insinuated those maxims of conduct, which
he was desirous his master should adopt. He observed
to him, that, while he entrusted his affairs into the hands
of his father's counsellors, he had the advantage indeed
of employing men of wisdom and experience, but men who
owed not their promotion to his favour, and who scarce
<PB N="455" REF="481"/>
thought themselves accountable to him for the exercise
of their authority: That by the factions, and cabals,
and jealousies, which prevailed among them, they more
obstructed the advancement of his affairs, than they
promoted it by the knowledge which age and practice
had conferred upon them: That while he thought pro∣per
to pass his time in those pleasures, to which his age
and royal fortune invited him, and in those studies,
which would in time enable him to sway the sceptre
with absolute authority, his best system of government
would be to entrust his authority into the hands of some
one person, who was the creature of his will, and who
could entertain no view but that of promoting his ser∣vice:
And that if this minister had also the same relish
for pleasure with himself, and the same taste for
science;
he could the more easily, at intervals, account to him
for his whole conduct, and introduce his master gradually
into the knowledge of public business, and thus, with∣out
tedious constraint or application, initiate him in the
science of government<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Cavendish, p. 12. Stowe, p. 499.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY entered into all the views of Wolsey; and
finding no one so capable of executing this plan of ad∣ministration
as the person who proposed it, he soon ad∣vanced
his favourite, from being the companion of his careless
hours, to be a member of his council; and from
being a member of his council, to be his sole and abso∣lute
minister. By this rapid advancement and uncon∣trouled
authority, the character and genius of Wolsey
had full opportunity to display itself. Insatiable in his
acquisitions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His charac∣ter.</NOTE> but still more magnificent in his expence:
Of extensive capacity, but still more unbounded enter∣prize:
Ambitious of power, but still more desirous of
<PB N="456" REF="482"/>
glory: Insinuating, engaging, persuasive; and, by turns,
lofty, elevated, commanding: Haughty to his equals,
but affable to his dependants; oppressive to the people,
but liberal to his friends; more generous than grateful;
less moved by injuries than by contempt; he seemed
framed to take the ascendant in every intercourse with
others, but exerted this superiority of <HI>nature</HI> with such
ostentation as exposed him to envy, and made every one
willing to recal the original inferiority or rather mean∣ness
of his <HI>fortune.</HI></P>
<P>THE branch of administration, in which Henry most
exerted himself, while he gave his entire confidence to
Wolsey, was the military, which, as it suited the natu∣ral
gallantry and bravery of his temper, as well as the
ardour of his youth, was the principal object of his at∣tention.
Finding, that Lewis had made great prepara∣tions
both by sea and land to resist him, he was no less
attentive to raise a formidable army and equip a consi∣derable
fleet for the invasion of France. The command
of the fleet was entrusted to Sir Edward Howard; who,
after scouring the channel some time, presented himself
before Brest, where the French navy then lay; and he
challenged them to a combat. The French admiral,
who expected from the Mediterranean a reinforcement
of some gallies under the command of Prejeant de Bi∣doux,
kept within the harbour, and saw with patience
the English burn and destroy the country in the neigh∣bourhood.
At last Prejeant arrived with six gallies, and
put into Conquet, a place within a few leagues of Brest,
where he secured himself behind some batteries, which
he had planted on rocks, that lay on each side of him.
Howard was notwithstanding determined to make an
attack;<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th April.</NOTE> and as he had but two gallies, he took himself
the command of one, and gave the other to Devereux
lord Ferrars. He was followed by some row-barges
<PB N="457" REF="483"/>
and some crayers under the command of Sir Thomas
Cheyney, Sir William Sidney, and other officers of di∣stinction.
He immediately <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>astened on Prejeant's ship,
and leaped on board of her, attended with one Carroz,
a Spanish cavalier, and seventeen Englishmen. The
cable, meanwhile, which fastened his ship to that of the
enemy, being cut, the admiral was thus left in the hands
of the French; and as he still continued the fight with
great gallantry, he was pushed overboard by their pikes<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">It was a maxim of Howard's, that no admiral was good for any thing, that was not brave even to a degree of madness. As the sea-service requires much less plan and contrivance and capacity than the land, this maxim has great plausibility and appearance of truth: Tho' the fate of Howard himself may serve as a proof that even there courage ought to be tempered with discretion.</NOTE>.
Lord Ferrars, seeing the admiral's galley fall off, fol∣lowed
with the other vessels; and the whole fleet was so
discouraged by the loss of their admiral, that they re∣tired
from before Brest<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 491. Herbert, Hollingshed, p. 816.</NOTE>. The French navy came out
of harbour; and even ventured to invade the coast of
Sussex. They were repulsed, and Prejeant, their ad∣miral,
lost an eye by the shot of an arrow. Lord How∣ard,
brother to the deceased admiral, received the com∣mand
of the English fleet; and little memorable passed
at sea during this summer.</P>
<P>GREAT preparations had been making at land, dur∣ing
the whole winter, for an invasion of France by the
way of Calais; but the summer was well advanced be∣fore
every thing was in sufficient readiness for the in∣tended
enterprize. The long peace, which the king∣dom
had enjoyed, had somewhat unfitted the English
for military expeditions; and the great change, which
had lately been introduced in the art of war, had ren∣dered
<PB N="458" REF="484"/>
it still more difficult to enure them to the use of
the weapons now employed in action. The Swiss, and
after them the Spaniards, had shown the advantage of
a stable infantry, who fought with pike and sword, and
were able to repulse even the heavy-armed cavalry, in
which the great force of the armies formerly consisted.
The practice of fire-arms was become very common;
Tho' the caliver, which was the weapon now used, was
so inconvenient, and attended with so many disadvan∣tages,
that it had not entirely discredited the use of
bows, a weapon in which the English excelled all Eu∣ropean
nations. The English archers still maintained
their reputation; and even during the present reign, the
king's allies had solicited him for supplies of this kind.
The second year after his accession, he sent a thousand
archers, under the command of lord Dacres, to the as∣sistance
of Ferdinand, his father-in-law, in his project∣ed
expedition against the Moors of Barbary; but as
that prince turned his arms against the French in Italy,
Darcy was sent back, without being employed in any service.
The King had also sent fifteen hundred arch∣ers
under the command of Sir Edward Poinings to the
assistance of Margaret, dutchess of Savoy, who made
use of them with great advantage against the duke of
Guelders, the great disturber of the Netherlands. A
considerable part of the forces, which Henry now le∣vied
for the invasion of France, consisted also of archers;
and so soon as affairs were in readiness, the vanguard of
the army, amounting to 8000 men, under the com∣mand
of the earl of Shrewsbury, sailed over to Calais.
Shrewsbury was accompanied with the earl of Derby,
the lords Fitzwater, Hastings, Cobham, and Sir Rice
ap Thomas, captain of the light horse. Another body
of 6000 men soon after followed under the command
<PB N="459" REF="485"/>
of lord Herbert, the chamberlain, attended with the
earls of Northumberland and Kent, the lords Audley
and Delawar, together with Carew, Curson, and other
gentlemen.</P>
<P>THE King himself prepared to follow with the main
body and rear of the army; and he appointed the queen
regent of the kingdom during his absence. That he
might secure her administration from all disturbance,
he ordered Edmond de la Pole, earl of Suffolk, to
be beheaded in the Tower, the nobleman who had
been attainted and imprisoned during the late reign.
The King was led to commit this act of violence
by the dying commands, as is imagined, of his fa∣ther,
who told him, that he never would be free from
danger, while a man of so turbulent a disposition as Suf∣folk
was alive. And as his brother, Richard de la Pole,
had accepted of a command in the French service, and
attempted very foolishly to revive the York vaction, and
to animate them against Henry, he probably drew <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore
suddenly the King's vengeance on the unhappy Suf∣folk.</P>
<P>AT last, Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th June.</NOTE> attended with the duke of Bucking∣ham
and many others of the nobility, arrived in Ca∣lais,
and entered upon his French expedition, whence
he fondly expected so much success and glory<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elcarius, lib. 14.</NOTE>. Of all
those allies, on whose assistance he so much relied, the
Swiss alone fully performed their engagements. Be∣ing
put in motion by a sum of money sent them by
Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasion of France.</NOTE> and incited by their victories obtained in Italy,
and by their animosity against France, they were pre∣paring
to enter that kingdom with an army of twenty-five
thousand men; and no equal force could be opposed
<PB N="460" REF="486"/>
to their incursion. Maximilian had received an advance
of 120,000 crowns from Henry, and had engaged to
reinforce the Swiss with 8000 men, but failed in his en∣gagements.
That he might make atonement to the
King, he himself appeared in the Low Countries, and
joined the English army with some German and Fle∣mish
soldiers, who were useful in giving an example of
discipline to Henry's new-levied forces. Observing the
disposition of the English monarch to he more bent on
glory than on interest, he inlisted himself in his service,
wore the cross of St. George, and received pay, a hun∣dred
crowns a day, as one of his subjects and captains.
But while he exhibited this extraordinary spectacle, of
an emperor of Germany serving under a King of Eng∣land,
he was treated with the highest respect by Henry,
and really directed all the operations of the combined
army.</P>
<P>BEFORE the arrival of Henry and Maximilian in
the camp, the earl of Shrewsbury and lord Herbert had
formed the siege of Teroüane, a town situate on the
frontiers of Picardy; and they began to attack the place
with vigour. Teligini and Crequi commanded in the
town, and had a garrison, which did not exceed a thou∣sand
men; yet male they such stout resistance as pro∣tracted
the siege a month; and they found themselves
at last more in danger from want of provisions and am∣munition
than from the assaults of the besiegers. Having
conveyed intelligence of their situation to Lewis, who
had advanced to Amiens with his army, that prince gave
orders to throw relief into the place.<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th Au∣gust.</NOTE> Fontrailles appear∣ed
at the head of 800 horsemen, each of whom carried a
sack of gun-powder behind him, and two quarters of bacon.
With this small force he made a sudden and unexpected
irruption into the English camp, and surmounting all re∣sistance,
<PB N="461" REF="487"/>
advanced to the fossee of the town, where
each horseman, threw down his burthen. They imme∣diately
returned at the gallop, and were so fortunate as
again to break thro' the English, and to receive little or
no loss, in this dangerous attempt<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Hist. de Chev. Bayard, chap. 57. Memoires de Bellai.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the English had,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Guinegate.</NOTE> soon after, full revenge for that
insult. Henry had received intelligence of the approach
of the French horse, who had advanced to protect this
incursion of Fontrailles; and he ordered some troops to
pass the Lis, in order to oppose them. The cavalry of
France, tho' they consisted chiefly of gentlemen, who
had behaved with great valour m many desperate ac∣tions
in Italy, were, on sight of the enemy, seized
with so unaccountable a panic, that they immediately
took to flight, and were pursued by the English.
The duke of Longueville, who commanded the French, Bussi
d'Amboise, Clermont, Imbercourt, the chevalier Bay∣ard,
and many other officers of distinction were taken
prisoners<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Memoires de Bellai, liv. 1. Polydore Virgil, lib. 27. Holling∣shed, p. 822, Herbert.</NOTE>. This action, or rather rout, is sometimes
called the battle of Guinegate, from the place where
it was fought; but more commonly the <HI>Battle of Spurs,</HI>
because the French, that day, made more use of their
spurs than of their swords or military weapons.</P>
<P>AFTER so considerable an advantage, the King, who
was at the head of a compleat army of above 50,000
men, might have made incursions to the gates of Paris,
and spread confusion and desolation every where. It
gave Lewis great joy, when he heard, that the English,
instead of pushing their victory, and attacking the dis∣mayed
troops of France, returned to the siege of an in∣considerable
place like Teroüane. The governors were
<PB N="462" REF="488"/>
obliged soon after to surrender the town; and Henry
found his acquisition of so little consequenee, tho' gain∣ed
at the expence of some blood, and what, in his pre∣sent
circumstances, was more important, of much va∣luable
time, that he immediately demolished the fortifi∣cations.
The anxieties of the French were again re∣newed
with regard to the motions of the English. The
Swiss at the same time had entered Burgundy with a very
formidable army, and laid siege to Dijon, which was in
no condition to resist them. Ferdinand himself, tho' he
had made a truce with Lewis, seemed disposed to lay
hold of every advantage which fortune should present to
him. Scarce over was the French monarchy in greater
danger, or less in a condition to defend itself against
those powerful armies, which on every side assailed or
threatened it. Even many of the inhabitants of Paris,
who believed themselves exposed to the rapacity and
violence of the enemy, began to dislodge, without
knowing what place could afford them greater safety and
protection.</P>
<P>BUT Lewis was extricated from his present difficulties
by the manifest blunders of his enemies. The Swiss
allowed themselves to be seduced into a negotiation by
Tremoüille, governor of Burgundy; and without mak∣ing
enquiry, whether that nobleman had any powers to
treat, they accepted of the conditions which he offered
them. Tremoüille, who knew, that he should be dis∣avowed
by his master, stipulated whatever they were
pleased to demand; and thought himself happy, at the
expence of some payments, and very large promises, to
get rid of so formidable an enemy<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Memoires du mareschal de Fleuranges, Beliarius, lib. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE measures of Henry showed equal ignorance in
the art of war with that of the Swiss in negotiation.
<PB N="463" REF="489"/>
Tournay was a great and rich city, which, tho' it lay
within the frontiers of Flanders, belonged entirely to
France, and afforded the troops of that kingdom a passage
into the middle of the Netherlands. Maximilian, who
was desirous to free his grandson from so troublesome a
neighbourhood, advised Henry to lay siege to this place;
and the English monarch, not considering that such an
acquisition nowise advanced his conquests in France,
was so imprudent as to follow this interested council.
The city of Tournay, by its antient charters, being ex∣empted
from the burthen of a garrison, the burghers,
even against the remonstrance of their sovereign, stre∣nuously
insisted on maintaining this dangerous privilege;
and they engaged, by themselves, to make a vigorous de∣fence
against the enemy<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Memories de Fleuranges.</NOTE>. Their courage failed them
when matters came to extremity; and after a few days
siege, the place was surrendered to the English.<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th Sep∣tember.</NOTE> Henry
so little regarded its privileges, that he immediately quar∣tered
a garrison in it, under the command of Sir Ed∣ward
Poinings. The bishop of Tournay was lately
dead; and as a new bishop was already elected by the
chapter, but not installed in his office, the King be∣stowed
the administration of the see on his favourite,
Wolsey, and put him in immediate possession of the re∣venues,
which were considerable<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Strype's Memorials, vol. i. p. 5, 6.</NOTE>. Hearing of the re∣treat
of the Swiss, and observing the season to be far
advanced, he thought proper to retire into England;
and he carried the greatest part of his army with him.
Success had attended him in every enterprize; and his
youthful mind was much elated with this seeming pro∣sperity;
but all men of judgment, comparing the ad∣vantages
of his situation with his progress, his expences
<PB N="464" REF="490"/>
with his acquisitions, were convinced, that this campaign,
so much vaunted, was, in reality, both ruinous and in∣glorious
to him<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE success, which, during this summer, had attended
Henry's arms in the North, was much more decisive.
The King of Scotland had summoned out the whole
force of his kingdom; and having passed the Tweed with
a brave, tho' a tumultuary army of above 50,000 men,
he ravaged those parts of Northumberland which lay
nearest that river, and employed himself in taking the
castles of Norham, Etal, Werke, Ford, and other places
of little importance. The lady Ford, a woman of great
beauty, being taken prisoner in her castle, was presented
to James, and so gained on the affections of that mo∣narch,
that he wasted in idle pleasure that critical time,
which, during the absence of his enemy, he should have
employed in pushing his conquests. His troops, lying
in a barren country, where they soon consumed all the
provisions, began to be pinched with necessity; and as
the authority of the prince was feeble, and military dis∣cipline,
during that age, extremely relaxed, many of
them had stolen from the camp, and retired homewards.
Meanwhile, the earl of Surrey, having collected a force
of 26,000 men, of which 5000 had been sent over from
the King's army in France, marched to the defence of
the country, and approached the Scots, who lay on some
high ground near the hills of Cheviot. The river Till
ran between the armies, and prevented an engagement:
Surrey therefore sent a herald to the Scots camp, chal∣lenging
the enemy to descend into the plain of Milfield,
which lay towards the south; and there, appointing a
day for the combat, try their valour on equal ground.
<PB N="465" REF="491"/>
As he received no satisfactory answer, he made a feint of
marching towards Berwic; as if he intended to enter
Scotland, to lay waste the borders, and cut off the pro∣visions
of the enemy. The Scots army, in order to pre∣vent
his purpose, put themselves in motion; and having
set fire to the huts in which they had quartered, they
descended from the hills. Surrey, taking advantage of
the smoke, which was blown towards him, and which
covered his movements, passed the Till with his artillery
and vanguard at the bridge of Twisel, and sent the rest
of his army to find a ford farther up the river.</P>
<P>AN engagement was now become inevitable between
the armies, and both sides prepared for it with great
tranquillity and order<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Buchannan, lib. 13. Drummond. Herbert. Polydore Virgil, lib. 27. Stowe, p. 493. Paullus Jovius.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th Sep∣tember.</NOTE>. The English divided their
army into two lines: Lord Howard led the main body
of the first line, Sir Edmond Howard the right wing,
Sir Marmaduke Constable the left. The earl of Surrey
himself commanded the main body of the second line,
lord Dacres the right wing, Sir Edward Stanley the left.
The Scots front presented three divisions to the enemy:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Flouden.</NOTE> The middle was led by the King himself; The right by
the earl of Huntley, assisted by lord Hume: The left by
the earls of Lenox and Argyle. A fourth division un∣der
the earl of Bothwel made a body of reserve. Hunt∣ley
began the battle; and after a sharp conflict, put
to flight the left wing of the English, and chaced them
off the field: But on returning from the pursuit, he
found the whole Scots army in great disorder. The di∣vision
under Lenox and Argyle, elated with the success
of the other wing, had broke their ranks, and notwith∣standing
the remonstrances and entreaties of La Motte,
<PB N="464" REF="492"/>

<PB N="465" REF="493"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="466" REF="494"/>
the French ambassador, had rushed headlong upon the
enemy. Not only Sir Edmond Howard, at the head
of his division, received them with great valour; but
Dacres, who commanded in the second line, wheeling
about during the action, fell upon their rear, and put
them to the sword without resistance. The division un∣der
the King himself and that under Bothwel, animated
by the valour of their leaders, still made head against
the English, and throwing themselves into a circle, pro∣tracted
the action till night separated the combatants.
The victory seemed yet uncertain, and the numbers
which fell on each fide were nearly equal, amounting to
above 5000 men: But the morning discovered evidently
where the advantage lay. The English had lost only
persons of small note; but the flower of the Scots no∣bility
had fallen in battle, and the King himself, after
the most diligent enquiry, could no where be found. In
searching the field, the English met with a dead body,
which resembled him, and was arrayed in a similar habit;
and they put it in a leaden coffin, and sent it to Lon∣don.
During some time it was kept unburied; because
James died under sentence of excommunication, on ac∣count
of his confederacy with France, and his opposi∣tion
to the holy see<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Buchannan, lib. 13. Herbert.</NOTE>: But upon Henry's application,
who pretended that that prince, in the instant before his
death, had discovered signs of repentance, absolution
was given him, and his body was interred. The Scots,
however, still asserted, that it was not James's body, which
was found in the field of battle, but that of one Elphinston,
who had been arrayed in arms resembling the King's, in
order to divide the attention of the English, and share
the danger with his master. It was believed that James
had been seen crossing the Tweed at Kelso; and some
<PB N="467" REF="495"/>
imagined that he had been killed by the vassals of lord
Hume, whom that nobleman had instigated to commit
so enormous a crime. But the, populace entertained the
opinion that he was still alive, and having gone secretly
in pilgrimage to the holy land, would soon return, and
take possession of the throne. This fond conceit was
long entertained in Scotland.</P>
<P>THE King of Scots and most of the chief nobility
being killed in the field of Flouden, so this battle was
called, a very inviting opportunity was offered to Henry
of gaining advantages over that kingdom, perhaps of
reducing it to subjection. But he discovered on this
occasion a mind truly great and generous. When the
Queen of Scotland, Margaret, who was created regent
during the infancy of her son, applied for peace, he
readily granted it; and took compassion of the helpless
condition of his sister and nephew. The earl of Surrey,
who had gained him so great a victory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1514.</NOTE> he restored to the
title of duke of Norfolk, which had been forfeited by his
father, for engaging on the side of Richard the third.
His son, lord Howard, was honoured with the title of
earl of Surrey. Sir Charles Brandon, his favourite, whom
he had before created viscount Lisle, was now raised to
the dignity of duke of Suffolk. Wolsey, who was both
his favourite and his minister, was created bishop of Lin∣coln.
Lord Herbert obtained the title of earl of Wor∣cester.
Sir Edward Stanley, that of lord Monteagle.</P>
<P>THO' peace with Scotland gave Henry security towards
the North, and enabled him to prosecute in tranquillity
his enterprise againist France, some other incidents had
happened, which more than counterbalanced this fortu∣nate
event, and served to open his eyes with regard to the
rashness of an undertaking, into which his youth and
high fortune had betrayed him.</P>
<P><PB N="468" REF="496"/>
LEWIS, fully sensible of the dangerous situation to
which his kingdom had been reduced during the former
campaign, was resolved, by every expedient, to prevent
the return of like perils, and to break the confederacy of
his enemies. The Pope was nowise disposed to push the
French to extremity; and provided they did not return
to take possession of Milan, his interest rather led him
to preserve the balance among the contending parties.
He accepted, therefore, of Lewis's offer to renounce
the council of Lyons; and he took off the excommuni∣cation
which his predecessor and himself had denounced
against that King and his kingdom. Ferdinand was now
fast declining in years, and as he entertained no farther
ambition than that of keeping possession of Navarre,
which he had subdued by his arms and policy, he rea∣dily
hearkened to the proposals of Lewis for prolonging
the truce mother year; and he even showed an inclina∣tion
of forming a more intimate connexion with that
monarch. Lewis had dropt hints of his intention to
marry his second daughter Renée, either to Charles, prince
of Spain, or his brother, Ferdinand, both of them grand∣children
to the Spanish monarch; and he declared his
resolution of bestowing on her, as her portion, his claim
to the dutchy of Milan. Ferdinand not only embraced
these schemes with avidity▪ but also engaged the em∣peror,
Maximilian, in the same views, and procured his
consent to a treaty, which opened so inviting a prospect
of aggrandizing their common grandchildren.</P>
<P>WHEN Henry was informed of Ferdinand's renewal
of the truce with Lewis, he fell into the most violent
rage, and loudly complained, that his father-in-law had
first, by the highest promises and professions, engaged
him in enmity with France, and afterwards, without
giving him the least warning, had now again sacrificed
<PB N="469" REF="497"/>
his interest to his own selfish purposes, and had left him
exposed alone to all the dangers and expences of the
war. In proportion to his easy credulity and unsuspect∣ing
reliance on Ferdinand was the vehemence with which
he exclaimed against the treatment, which he met with;
and he threatened revenge for this egregious treachery
and breach of faith<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Petrus de Angleria, Epist. 545, 546.</NOTE>. But he lost all patience when
informed of the other negotiation, by which Maximilian
was also seduced from his alliance, and where proposals
had been hearkened to, for the marriage of the prince of
Spain with the daughter of France. Charles, during the
lifetime of the late King, had been affianced to Mary,
Henry's second sister; and as the prince now approached
the age of puberty, the King had expected the immedi∣ate
completion of the marriage, and the honourable
settlement of a sister, for whom he had entertained a very
tender affection. Such a complication, therefore, of in∣juries
gave him the highest: displeasure, and inspired him
with a desire of expressing his disdain towards those who
had taken advantage of his youth and inexperience, and
had abused his too great facility.</P>
<P>THE duke of Longueville, who had been made pri∣soner
at the battle of Guinegate, and who was still de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ained
in England, was ready to take advantage of all
these dispositions of Henry, in order to procure a peace
and even an alliance, which he knew to be so passionately
desired by his master. He represented to the King, that
Anne, Queen of France, being lately dead, a door was
thereby opened for an affinity, which might tend to the
advantage of both kingdoms, and which would serve to
terminate honourably all the differences between them▪
That she had left Lewis no male children; and as he
<PB N="470" REF="498"/>
had ever entertained a strong desire of having heirs to
the crown, no marriage seemed more suitable to him
than that with the princess of England, whose youth and
beauty afforded the most flattering hopes in that parti∣cular:
That tho' the marriage of a princess of sixteen,
with a King of fifty-three, might seem unsuitable; yet
the other advantages, attending the alliance, were more
than a sufficient compensation for this inequality: And
that Henry, in loosening his connections with Spain,
whence he had never experienced any advantage, would
contract a close affinity with Lewis, a prince, who thro'
his whole life, had invariably maintained the character of probity and honour.</P>
<P>AS Henry seemed to hearken to this discourse with very
willing ears, Longueville informed his master of the pro∣bability,
which he discovered, of bringing this matter to
a happy conclusion; and he received full powers for ne∣gotiating
the treaty. The articles were easily adjusted
between the monarchs. Lewis agreed that Tournay
should remain in the hands of the English;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with France. 7th of Au∣gust.</NOTE> that Richard
de la Pole should be banished to Metz, there to live on
a pension assigned him by Lewis; that Henry should re∣ceive
payment of a million of crowns, being the arrears
due by treaty to his father and himself; and that the
princess Mary should bring four hundred thousand crowns
as her portion, and enjoy as large a jointure as any
queen of France, even the former, who was heiress of Britanny.
The two princes also stipulated the succours,
with which they should mutually supply each other, in
case either of them was attacked by any enemy<NOTE N="$" PLACE="foot">Du. Tillet.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN consequence of this treaty, Mary was sent over to
France with a splendid retinue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th of Oc∣tober.</NOTE> and Lewis met her at
Abbeville, where the espousals were celebrated. He
<PB N="471" REF="499"/>
was enchanted with the beauty, grace, and numerous
accomplishments of the young princess; and being na∣turally
of an amorous disposition, which his advanced
age had not entirely cooled, he was seduced into such a
course of gaiety and pleasure, as proved very unsuitable
to his declining state of health<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Brantome Eloge de Louis XII.</NOTE>. He died in less than
three months after his marriage, to the infinite regret of
his subjects,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st of Ja∣nuary.</NOTE> who, sensible of his tender concern for their
welfare, gave him with one voice the honourable appel∣lation
of <HI>father of his people.</HI></P>
<P>FRANCIS, duke of Angouleme, a youth of one and
twenty, who had married Lewis's eldest daughter, suc∣ceeded
him on the throne; and by his activity, valour,
generosity, and other virtues, gave prognostics of a
happy and glorious reign. This young monarch had
been extremely struck with the charms of the English
princess; and even during his predecessor's life-time, had
payed her such close attendance as made some of his
friends apprehend that he had entertained views of
gallantry towards her. But being warned, that, by in∣dulging
himself in this passion, he might readily exclude
his own title to the throne, he forbore all farther ad∣dresses;
and even watched the young dowager with a
very careful eye during the first months of her widow∣hood.
Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, was at that
time in the court of France, the most comely personage
of his time, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he most accomplished in all the exer∣cises,
which were then thought to befit a courtier and
a soldier. He was Henry's chief favourite; and that
monarch had even once entertained thoughts of marry∣ing
him to his sister, and had given indulgence to that
mutual passion, which took place between them. The
<PB N="472" REF="500"/>
queen asked Suffolk whether he had now the courage,
without farther reflection, to espouse her; and she told
him, that her brother would more easily forgive him for
not asking his consent, than for acting contrary to his
orders. Suffolk, declined not so inviting an offer; and
the marriage was secretly compleated at Paris. Francis,
who was pleased with this marriage, as it prevented
Henry from forming any powerful alliance by means of
his sister<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Petrus de Angleria, Epist. 544.</NOTE>, interposed his good offices in appeasing him:
And even Wolsey, having entertained no jealousy of
Suffolk, who was content to participate in the King's
pleasures, and had no ambition to interpose in state af∣fairs,
was active in reconciling the King to his sister and
brother-in-1aw; and he obtained them permission to re∣turn
to England.</P>
