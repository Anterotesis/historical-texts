<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. Palmer.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>IN every rank of life the friends of love,</L>
<L>(From Goddesses below to Gods above)</L>
<L>We claim you for our patrons, and prefer</L>
<L>Our suit to those, whose judgment cannot err;</L>
<L>For you have hearts, and we make no appeal</L>
<L>But to the test of what those hearts shall feel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If Nature quits us, every hope is fled,</L>
<L>For we have nought to tender in her stead,</L>
<L>No pageant to exhaust the Treasurer's chest,</L>
<L>Or rob the Painter of his natural rest:</L>
<L>Failing to please, we aim not to surprise;</L>
<L>Palling your ears, we cannot feast your eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But we believe you never will submit</L>
<L>To naturalize these substitutes for wit,</L>
<L>Therefore it is, our author keeps the stage</L>
<L>With all the pertinacity of age;</L>
<L>Not in defiance of the Public will,</L>
<L>But in the hope that you'll support him still;</L>
<L>Not in exclusion of another's name,</L>
<L>For dear to him is every brother's fame,</L>
<L>But to shew genius of a stronger growth,</L>
<L>Which else might sink to indolence and sloth,</L>
<L>That feeble plants, when nourish'd by your care,</L>
<L>Ev'n in the winter of their age will bear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If, ere the hour shall come that lay<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to rest</L>
<L>All hopes and fears within the human breast,</L>
<L>Once more your Poet ventures to convene</L>
<L>His Muse's Patrons to the moral scene,</L>
<L>'Tis in the hope that for your favors past</L>
<L>He may yet make some small return at last.</L>
<L>Here, if he fails, and shou'd this night's event</L>
<L>Prove that your favors and his fires are spent,</L>
<L>What on the part of candor shall be said,</L>
<L>But that his heart was stouter than his head?</L>
<L>But that, advancing to a fresh attack,</L>
<L>He dropt, and <HI>"died with harness on his back!"</HI></L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL! I could almost swear—yet I won't be sure. I wish he would look back once again.—Yes it is, by St. George, it is my dear brother Frederick.—Ah! my sweet fellow, wel∣come to England! Don't you remember little David?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>David! may I believe my eyes? 'Tis he, sure enough. Come to my arms my brave lad! Why you are alter'd out of knowledge, and in the navy uniform—That's right, my boy, there you're in your proper line.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, aye, Sir!—But we'll talk of that by-and-by. How are you in the first place? How fares it with you, my hearty? where are you come from? what sort of a cruize have you had in t'other country? Have you fallen in with father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, nor do I wish him to know of my arrival as yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be it so, be it so! Mum's the word for that.—Are you come home full or empty? Egad, you'll find father cling plaguily by the claws, damn'd close in the lockers.—If you are bare of the ready, I've plenty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you, David, thank you heartily; but I can shift. Keep your money my good lad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not that, with your leave; I know a little better than so, we may hope.—But what brings you home o'the sudden?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>My father's peremptory commands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Enough said: then 'tis on account of sister's wedding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe not—but I did not know till this moment she was married. Tell me the particu∣lars, for 'tis interesting intelligence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why she's married, that's all I can tell you; she has got a mate of father's own chusing; so he thinks he has done a mighty feat, and rigg'd her out for a fair weather voyage; but between you and me, I suspect there's foul wind in feather∣bed bay, and a kind of cat-and-dog harmony on board between 'em; that's my notion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can well believe it: She has not the best temper in the world. What is the gentle∣man's name and condition?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wrangle is his name, and wrangling I suspect to be his condition; but I heartily dislike the man, and therefore I wou'd not have you take his character from me: see him, and judge for yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is one marriage in our family then to begin with; and now I must tell you, David, in confidence, that I do not believe it was on account of this wedding my father call'd me home in such haste, but with a view to another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Like enough, like enough; that's your look-out, thank Heaven, and not mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bad luck for me, David, if it is as I fear; but you know Sir Paul Ruby is now dead, and my first love is a widow, young, blooming, and
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
mistress of a mine of wealth: You can remember Clara Middleton, how devotedly I was attach'd to her, and how cruelly my father tore me from her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do I remember it? Yes, to be sure, and in my mind never forgave old crusty for his hard∣heartedness to this hour; but if that be his sport, let him come on: By the Lord Harry, Fred. you'll be a gay fellow if you can bring that prize into harbour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hush! hush! that can never be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you are in the right not to be too sure, for all the world is after her; but if she has a hankering for you still, you know—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven forbid!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I won't flatter you, brother, you are a little gone off to be sure, rather the worse for wear, a small matter out of trim, but we can soon put that to rights, if your timbers are but staunch.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not there I shou'd fail, let us hope; but if death was the alternative, I cou'd not give my hand to Lady Ruby.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>I take you now; you'll be no man's se∣cond; I see how it is with you, first oar or none at all.—Lord love you, what a whim is that! 'Tis no denial to a good ship because another man has commanded her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are wide of the mark, friend David; it is not that I object to Lady Ruby as a widow, for I dare say she is still beautiful as an angel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's more than I know, for I never saw one; but I'm sure she's as fresh and as fine as a daisey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that is as lowly a similitude as you can well find for her; but with all her charms, and all her riches, and all the love she cou'd bestow upon me, were it warm and flattering as in our fondest moments, the barrier between us would be insuperable: fate has disunited us for ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then fate has play'd you a very foul trick, let me tell you; for, search the world through, you will no where find her fellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I dare trust you with a secret, I wou'd put that to the trial; and yet I think you are too good a fellow to tell tales.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me none to tell, and that's a sure way to prevent it; but I think you might venture to trust me too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>This it is, and I'll make a short story of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do so!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have brought a virtuous and lovely girl with me into England—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who has been the preserver of my life, the companion of my journey from Padua to this place, and whom I have pledg'd myself to make the partner of my fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your wife?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>My wife: the word is passed, and I must keep it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure you must; but I'm sorry for it; there's no more to be said.—Death and fury! What a torrent will you have about your ears! Why, father will come down on you like a water∣spout.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am now seeking out some place where she can be lodg'd and boarded with people of re∣putation, till I can arrange my affairs; but I have been so long out of England, that I am almost as much a stranger in London as herself. Perhaps, David, you can help me out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that's what I'm thinking of: I have a friend, a right one, as staunch an old cock as ever crow'd, my navy agent, Billy Bustler by name. I'm to dine with him to-day—and he has a sister Kate by the same token; a good soul! but if your Miss is'nt of the right sort, look you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh fie, fie,! Can you suppose any other∣wise?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well! but a word in time, you know—for Kate's a pure maiden, you must think, with a good deal of the buckram about her. Lord!
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
how I do set her up sometimes. So, if you've stowed away all your courtship, d'ye see, and got your marriage tack fairly a-board, why upon these terms I think I have interest enough with Kate to coax her into compliance.—Now, what say you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us about it directly; for my lovely charge is expecting me, and time is precious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say no more, my bright fellow! As for Billy, he's a sure card. Give me your arm, and we'll be down upon him in a whiff.</P>

<HEAD>SCENE II. <HI>A Chamber in Mr.</HI> Wrangle's <HI>House.</HI></HEAD>
<STAGE><HI>(Mr. and Mrs.</HI> Wrangle.)</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my dear, dear Mr. Wrangle, I have been sighing for a sight of you this many a long hour: Where in the world have you hidden your∣self from the eyes of your fond doating wife?—Come, come, my love, look kindly upon me: We that are so happy in each other, should always meet with rapture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my dear Lyddy, and who is so rapturous as I? Where is the husband that so doats upon his wife?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't say so, don't say so. Can you lay your hand upon your heart, and say you love me to the full as well as ever you did?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Better, better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, you don't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll swear you don't; I know to a certainty your affection abates, whereas mine in∣creases every hour: nay, it is so excessive, that I am almost afraid it grows troublesome to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't fear it; from my soul I believe our fondness for each other is equal and alike: The uninterrupted harmony of our nuptial state, and the fidelity I have ever manifested—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and what has my fidelity been, I would ask? Notorious, unique, the talk of all
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
the town. I am really so pointed at in all compa∣nies as a mere domestic creature, that I am almost asham'd to shew my face in any fashionable circle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never mind their sneering; your own conscience can acquit you of deserving it.—If I were you, Mrs. Wrangle, I wou'd sometimes pass an evening at home, if it were only to shew them you despise their spleen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sometimes, Mr. Wrangle! sometimes pass an evening at home! Where is the woman of fashion passes so many evenings at home as I do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>The present won't be one of the num∣ber, if I may judge from your dress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>The present indeed! How can you ex∣pect it? Is'nt it opera night? Wou'd you wish to deprive me of my only pleasure? Is there any thing in life I love so well as an opera?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes! your husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my husband to be sure—my husband is before every pleasure, so you need not take me up so quickly: for you know, my dear, you are all in all to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>With the opera to help it out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>The opera indeed! You should be asham'd to mention the opera, where I think, con∣sidering all things, I might expect to be indulg'd with a box to myself, instead of scrubbing into the pit, as I do at present; which give me leave to say, few women of my pretensions would put up with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Keep your temper Mrs. Wrangle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>And don't I keep my temper, Mr. Wrangle? Is'nt it the part of a friend to let you know the whole town cries out upon you? that you're the public talk? your character suffers by it—People know what a fortune I brought you; and you know in your heart, my dear, that if you had a little more of the gentleman in your spirit—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Sblood Madam, if I had a great deal less, you are enough to call it up.</P>

<P>There, there! now you are going to be in one of your <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>antarums.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then why do you provoke me to it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I provoke you! I only tell you of your faults, and you have not temper to hear of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very sharp-sighted in spying out my faults, methinks, and at the same time either shut your eyes upon your own, or find them too incurable to meddle with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I plead to no fault but the fault of keep∣ing terms with you; and that I'm resolved to cor∣rect out of hand: I'll put up with your ill humours no longer; my father, my family, the whole town shall know your treatment of me. I cou'd bear my lot well enough, if the world did but know I was not that happy wife they suppose me to be.</P>

<P>Never think about him; he grows quite intolerable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless me! I could not have believed it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, because you will believe me what I am not, never have been, nor ever shall be—happy with that man: My temper is quick, his sullen; my nature is open and sincere; his dark and jealous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>He jealous! Mr. Wrangle jealous!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! extremely so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cou'd not have believ'd it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now cannot I for the life of me com∣prehend why you cou'd not have believ'd it: be∣cause, tho' I am sufficiently guarded in my con∣duct, especially before him, yet I shou'd hope I am not too vain when I suppose some few attractions, some small pretensions, may still be said to belong to me—tho' comparatively nothing with what your ladyship possesses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, my dear Madam, you have charms in full measure; and if you rather chuse to be complimented upon them than your discre∣tion, your husband shall be credited by me for all the jealousy you think fit to ascribe to him, with as much or as little cause as you may be disposed to allow of</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>I believe there is no woman but wou'd be mortified if her husband was to say to her, “It is not in your power to make me jealous.”</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant you, the power is desirable, the exercise of it an experiment of some danger: 'tis like a dormant title; one wou'd not give it up, tho it may not suit us to assume it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>A-propos, to a title—now your year of widowhood is up, have you ask'd a certain question of that little heart of your's, and has the sly thing ever been brought to confession about this same Lord Sensitive, who follows you up and down like your shadow?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes—I've talk'd with the sly thing, as you call it, by the hour about him, and a very edifying conversation it was, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, indeed! as how!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I took it roundly to task, for I began to perceive it had got some foolish flutter∣ings, which you good wives know nothing of—now this I did not like; for, being as you see a free woman, I resolve to profit by past sorrows, and not enslave myself any more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Humph! that's a widow's resolution, made without meaning, and broken without re∣morse; but for my part, as I don't believe you are at all in love with him, I must wonder what amusement you can find in tormenting him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Law, child! the man torments him∣self; he takes all trouble off my hands, and makes me a bye-stander in my own quarrels: He sees things that never had existence; hears things that were never said; and seems to have a phantom ever at his beck, like a conjuror's familiar, that whis∣per's in his ear, and drives him upon extravagan∣cies that exceed all credibility.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now that is quite cruel, Mrs. Wrangle; it really gives me pain; but it is my misfortune to have every attention of mine misunderstood.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wou'd your lordship be understood then to have no attention for any lady in this room besides myself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wou'd be thought not to want more temptations than one for visiting Mrs. Wrangle; but whatever interpretation you may please to put upon my attentions, I must think myself highly honor'd when they are regarded as an object either by yourself or Lady Ruby.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very unlucky, ladies, and perhaps unseasonably intrude upon some more interesting business; Lady Ruby's thoughts at least seem to be otherwise engag'd than upon the present subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are not quite out of your guess; they were just then upon a ramble.—I think, my lord, you was last summer in Italy—</P>

<P>In Italy! Yes, yes, madam, I was in Italy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Did you make any long stay there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really I—I have almost forgot how long I staid.—But pray, madam, why do you wish to know? Have you any particular motive for en∣quiring how long I staid at Padua, or what pass'd whilst I was there?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you say so? Oh! you spite∣ful thing, what a persecution have you drawn upon me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed and indeed, Lady Ruby, you have alarm'd me: I feel every thing that falls from you, and am tremblingly alive to the slightest whis∣per that may wound my reputation where I am most interested to guard it. I entreat, if you have heard any thing against me, that you will suffer me to defend myself.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord, I don't perfectly understand you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not hear it was idle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Admit it was a serious one then, for ar∣gument's sake—such fooleries, I should hope, do not stick fast to a man's character, especially after the object is shaken off and forgotten.</P>
</SP>

<P>Perhaps that may be the worst part of the story, if the lady was not unworthy—but I am no inquisitor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll not impeach the lady's reputation, neither will I allow it to be said I have dealt disho∣norably with her in any shape—If any gentleman dares to fix that aspersion upon me, I am ready with my answer.</P>

<P>Hold, my Lord, I must set you right in one particular; and I insist on your believing me, when I declare to you, upon my honor, that Fre∣derick Mowbray is not my informer, neither does my information come by any other channel from him.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, who can suppose I wou'd? But with respect to entering into her history with you, I can't do it; for 'tis brother Frederick's affair, and he'll satisfy you in all points. It is not I that am going to marry her, but he; all I know is, that she is a person of rank, and an emigrant. Take notice, I have never seen her, and moreover it is a close secret from father.</P>
</SP>

<P>Billy, Billy, if it is a secret affair, don't meddle or make with it: as sure as can be you'll get into hot water with Sir Miles Mowbray.</P>

<P>Hot water indeed! let him take care then he don't scald his own fingers. I shall act the strait part by my friend David; if he deceives me, that is his fault; if I deceive him, I am a flincher, and no true Englishman—so I say the lady shall be welcome: I say it, and who shall gainsay it?</P>

<P>Come, sweet Kate, it only wants your concurrence; take a little pity into your heart for a poor orphan stranger, driven out of her own country by the murderers of her parents, and give her a small sample of your hospitality, for the honor of old England.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, I know it well: and why are you so superlatively blest, but because you had the grace to discover that I cou'd choose better for you than you cou'd for yourself? Why is a father call'd the head of his family, but as it is his business to think for all those whose heads can't think for themselves?

<P>When Lord Sensitive's confidential ser∣vant inform'd you of his attachment for Sabina Rosny, did he speak of her as a woman of character?</P>

<SP>
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
<SPEAKER>W. Woman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes, my lady; he gave the young gentlewoman a very high character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>For her discretion, I ask you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W. Woman.</SPEAKER>
<P>For her good qualities, my lady, her accomplishments, and above all, for her beauty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pooh! her beauty is out of the ques∣tion; I am simply talking of her character, of her conduct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W. Woman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, madam, I did not think it handsome to be over-curious about conduct; for I concluded Mr. Carrington too much a man of honor to betray his master's secrets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it shou'd seem indeed, by his taking you into counsel for the keeping them.—You may leave me.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Am I permitted once more to ap∣proach you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have the same permission, my Lord, that you always had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sensible my visits can no longer be acceptable to you: where suspicion has taken hold, kindness cannot keep its place; I had there∣fore determined never to intrude again, but a natu∣ral wish to attempt my justification, and, more than all, a natural weakness, which my heart cannot in∣instantly
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
shake off, induce me once more, and for the last time, to solicit an admission.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am happy, to see your lordship upon any terms; and I hope you will repeat you<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> visits for the last time so often, that our ac∣quaintance will improve by it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, madam, madam, whilst you can sport with my feelings in this manner, your levity convinces me how indifferent I am to you: nay, I believe from my soul I am become your aversion; and I am astonish'd, when your ladyship so well knows the real motives of my visits here, you have not ordered your doors to be shut against so un∣welcome an intruder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, my Lord, what is our quarrel just now? and why shou'd my doors, that are apt to be open to all persons of honor, and my friends in general, be shut against you in particular?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I understand some tattling busy∣body has impressed you with unfavourable notions of my conduct, in an affair, which delicacy for∣bids me to explain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then let delicacy prevail with you to forbear the subject. We may be good friends without searching into the secrets of each other's heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, madam, 'tis a compromise that saves us both from an unpleasant task: my heart is not pure enough for your inspection; your's, was I to search it, would disclose all the tender feel∣ings, all the fond unabated affections, that are there glowing and alive for a certain person, who sways it still, tho' absent and neglectful.—'Sdeath, madam! it is a discovery that would drive me into madness, nor will I stoop to friendship where I have once aspir'd to love!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is sincere at least: you think my nature steady to a first attachment; credit yourself for the same principle, and we have each of us our separate pursuits; they clash no longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I then be permitted to ask you one plain question?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart; propose it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you not at this moment still so wedded to a first attachment, as to be no longer susceptible of any other?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a question, let me observe to you, that none but the most intimate friend could expect an answer to; how then can your lordship look for it, when you will not submit to be re∣garded in that character?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if a lover presum'd to put such a question, wou'd you wave it in his case?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he was a man I dislik'd, I might perhaps avail myself of so fair an opportunity for getting rid of him; if he was one I esteem'd, I shou'd be sorry to find he had so self-tormenting a curiosity belonging to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, loveliest of women! ever charming, ever irresistible, pardon my too-anxious sensibility, and pity one who lives but in your sight. I find it is impossible to escape—scorn me, trifle with me, torture me as you will, still I must adore you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Must you be always in extremes? Now you are more intolerable than ever.—Let go my hand I desire of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Grudge me not this short respite from my anguish; for pity's sake do not leave me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Positively I must.—Ah! you have crush'd my hand—release it, I beseech you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Spare me these few moments, I am not so presumptuous as to flatter myself they can last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hardly think they shou'd; I don't believe any human hand could bear to be so squeez'd much longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus let me atone the injury I have done it.</P>
<STAGE>(Kisses her hand.)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perceive, my lord, our interviews should last no longer than whilst we keep up the spirit of controversy; as soon as ever we begin to be of the same mind, it is time we should part.</P>

<P>I humbly thank you.—In truth, my lady, I do greatly covet to be near you, near in every sense. Believe me I shou'd greet the moment as the happiest of my life, that connected me and mine in the closest and nearest alliance with your ladyship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has that always been your wish?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam!—My lady!—<STAGE>(Ahem)</STAGE> I am not fure I rightly comprehend your ladyship's question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I remind you of your past opinion, Sir Miles, it is because I wou'd not have you be deceived as to your present one—I do not think that within the period since you and I have ceas'd to be acquainted I have any such acquirements to boast of as shou'd induce you think better of me now that I am a widow, than you did before I was a wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a proof of your modesty, that you are pleas'd to say so; and what is so engaging? 'tis a token of your candor and sincerity (amiable qualities!) and I always did you the justice to say that you possess'd them in a very eminent degree.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! did you say that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did, I did upon my soul—I said it, I thought it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I suspect you do not think better of a woman for being only modest, candid, and sincere,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, Madam! Can I give a stronger proof how highly I esteem those virtues than by tendering you my son, my eldest son Frederick?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless me! wou'd you recommend so bad a bargain to your son?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so, my lady? how so? Why do you say—so bad a bargain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because you have only reckon'd up a ragged troop of virtues, which you once turn'd from your doors, when they were in better plight than at present, without naming money, which, I believe, in your opinion, is a virtue worth them all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know the value of money, Madam, tho' I won't call it a virtue; and I own to you that Sir Paul Ruby's property, so worthily bequeath'd to your ladyship, consolidated with what Frederick,
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
as my heir, may expect, are circumstances not to be overlooked in the calculations of a prudent father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir Miles, I am still so much your son's friend as to rejoice at having discover'd, that when interest prompts you to seek out an alliance for him, the good qualities of the lady you contract with will be no bar to your bargain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very much on the contrary, very much indeed; and therefore let me hope, my good lady, when my son, whom I look for hourly, shall arrive, you will graciously permit me to lay him at your feet.—In this hope I humbly take my leave—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your patience for a moment:—What∣ever hopes you are pleased to found upon this con∣versation, I must candidly tell you they are not at all to be depended upon; and recollect, Sir Miles, that if my affection for your son is now ex∣tinguish'd, it was your own authority that put an end to it;—let me add, that if I am not greatly flatter'd by the honor of this visit, it is because I clearly comprehend the motives of it.</P>

<P>FRIEND of my life! my benevolent preserver! I have now happily accomplish'd one effort of my gratitude, by escorting you to an asylum, where persecution cannot reach you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Generous Mowbray! I do wish to tell you, in the language you have taught me, how my poor heart is penetrated with your goodness to me, but I am not eloquent; I can only say I do thank you for your care of me, and for bringing me to your charitable country, which I do honor from my soul; indeed I do honor it; but, alas! it is not for me ever to be happy in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why do you say that? I am incapable of deceiving you: this instant I am going to my fa∣ther, and be assur'd it shall not be many days before the dubious situation you are in shall be honorably done away, and all my promises fulfill'd</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, no, my good friend, I shall not call upon you for those promises; we are now in England, and those promises are nothing, they are void.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can you mean, Sabina? Do you suspect my integrity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not suspect you at all—but you was sick, take notice, very sick, and derang'd in your senses, when, because I did do my possible in pity and compassion, to assist you in your malady, you was pleas'd to make those promises you speak, and I did let them pass for the time, saying nothing to the contrary of them, because they were very good and commodious for me, as a single woman, travelling alone with you, under pro∣tection of your honor; but now that you are at home▪ again, and, thanks to Heaven! in good
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
health, I shall not be so base to let you ruin your∣self by marrying poor me, only because you pledg'd your word when you did hardly know what that word meant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nobly conceiv'd! but I am not that wretch, to sacrifice my honor to a mean and mer∣cenary evasion: Tho' my heart has been wounded, as you know, it has not been debas'd; and I am determin'd to go this instant to my father, and an∣nounce the resolution I have taken.</P>

<P>Bless me! I did not know this room was occupied: I beg a thousand pardons—Mr. Mowbray!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady Ruby!—this is indeed a surprize.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I desire I may not break in upon your conference, Sir. My business with the master of this house may be transacted in his office.</P>
</SP>

<P>Our conference, Madam, is at an end. I was on the point of my departure.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means let me hasten it: I shou'd be sorry to deprive the lady of one moment of your company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>It has been my good fortune to be the lady's companion for some time, and we are just arriv'd in England. Mademoiselle Rosny is an emigrant of noble birth, as much to be admir'd for her virtues, as she is to be pitied for her mis∣fortunes.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rosny! is that the lady's name?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Madam, that is my name: Alas! I am the last that bear it: Those that did honor to it once are now no more: I am a miserable solitary relict.</P>

<P>How good, to feel for the distress'd and stranger! Ah, had you known my parents:—They perish'd at Marseilles; I fled to Padua, but sor∣row overtook me; I had great sufferings there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can well believe it.—Lord Sensitive has that to answer for.</P>
<STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sabina, you shall spare yourself the pain∣ful recital: Lady Ruby, if I rightly know her, is not curious to inquire into the private histories of the unfortunate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>In point of idle curiosity, I hope you do me no more than justice; but to know misfor∣tunes for the purpose of relieving them, permit me to say that I am curious.—If Mademoiselle Rosny shou'd prefer the protection of one of her own sex to her present situation, my heart and house are open to receive her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! that is great consideration for me truly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>What say you, amiable Sabina? I am, like you, a solitary woman: will you consent to be my companion and friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have all possible empressment for your goodness, and certainly so charming a lady cannot fail to have a tender heart for the unhappy; but I am without a friend in England, except this worthy gentleman, and I do think he will advise me for the best. It seems to me that you are not quite estrang'd to one another: Mr. Mowbray is very honorable and good to poor me; I pray you let me hear what he will say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you believe me worthy of the trust, and sincere in wishing for it—</P>

<P>How can I doubt of either? But my con∣nection with this lady is a delicate one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must suppose it is an honorable one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the strictest sense. Gratitude not less than, under Providence, for my life, bind me to Sabina Rosny. Through the sad period of an
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
excruciating illness, her soothing pity was my only support—snatch'd by her care from death, or a condition worse than death, could I do less than dedicate what's left of life and senses to the gene∣rous preserver of them? I am now going to my father—I need not say how much my fate de∣pends upon that interview.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, no! I do once more pray and implore of you, Mr. Frederick, not to speak of me to your father: I have reasons for that, which it would be great pain and difficulty for me to expli∣cate to you; but, since my lady is so good to per∣mit me to come to her, I do pray you let me avail myself of her kind favor, and then, when I will make my confession to her, you shall find yourself very happy that you have not spoken to your father.</P>

<P>No apology to me, my good Mrs. Ca∣therine; your brother knows that my business

<P>Every thing this house contains is so en∣tirely at your ladyship's command, that if you was to take away not only my amiable guest, but sister Kate into the bargain, I must submit and obey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kate.</SPEAKER>
<P>Law! brother! how you talk! as if such a person as me could be company for her ladyship—but Miss Rosny deserves better entertainment than we can give her; and to be sure, if your ladyship so wishes, much as we shall feel the loss of her sweet society, yet, with Mr. Frederick's consent, we shall resign her.</P>

<P>I am very thankful, indeed I am, good madam and good sir, for your politeness; and I am persuaded that the more I had known you, the more and more I shou'd have lov'd you; but adieu for the present! I will pay you my devoirs as soon as it is in my power.</P>

<P>Where am I? What is this obscurity, that ga∣thers like a cloud ready to burst upon me? Sabina meditates to set me free—but why? I cannot pe∣netrate her motives: I have no trace of what I may have divulg'd in the wand'rings of my reason. Perhaps she has discover'd my first love in the per∣son of this lady, and means to make a generous sa∣crifice of her right in me—I'll not permit it: no! tho' my heart should burst with the recoil of that unconquerable affection, which the sight of my

<P>Is she so? then I caught a glimpse of her for the first time.—Well! I say nothing, every man to his own fancy; but for my part, brother Frederick, if little England cou'd'nt furnish me with a mate to my liking, I wou'd be content to go single for the rest of my days.</P>

<P>David, we won't talk upon that subject just now.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure I will, if you wish it—But harkye, Frederick, I hope you don't take in ill part what I said to you, only because I thought it a pity an honest Englishman shou'd go out of his own country for a wife; whereas, do you see, if your heart is pledg'd, why there's an end of the matter.</P>

<P>I cannot say, Sir Miles, that I have any particular good news to impart to you; and yet, with your leave, I would fain solicit your attention for a few minutes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's the matter now? Why do you round me with a circumbendibus in this man∣ner, when I so often desire you to speak plainly, and to the point at once?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, then to the pointat once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, that's the way to be un∣derstood, son Wrangle; whereas to be verbose and circumstantial, is to be tedious; and when a man is tedious, you know, 'tis ten to one if his hearers are not tir'd with his preamble, before he lets them into the body of his bill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>At the present moment I conceive that fault does not lie with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't say it does, I don't say it does; yet a fault it is, lie where it will, and every man has his faults, which it is the part of a friend to tell him of, it is the part of a father—You yourself are not without faults, son Wrangle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own it, Sir; I do not affect to dis∣guise them; but the faults I would recommend to your cognizance are secret faults, which you do not see, and which I cannot remedy without your help.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, Sir, my insight may go deeper than you are aware of; I have spied out some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lurking peccadilloes in a certain person, which I shall not descant upon in your hearing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Peccadilloes, do you call 'em? they merit a much harder name, believe me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, well; if for obvious rea∣sons I don't give them hard names, let that be no proof with you I mean to overlook them.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you will not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be sure of that, son Wrangle; you will hardly doubt but I have my daughter's inte∣rest very thoroughly at heart, and, having been the author of your union, feel myself responsible

for the happiness or unhappiness that may result from it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Miles, I honor you for the can∣dor of that very liberal confession: Our's was not a match of passion; prudence concerted our al∣liance, and on your wisdom I repos'd my hopes; but indeed, and indeed I am not what I seem; I am not that happy man you suppos'd me to be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I'm sorry for it, but don't de∣spair; confiding your situation to me, you take a prudent step, and you shall find me, my dear Wrangle, a zealous friend to serve you—Tempers may be corrected! there shall be no want of admo∣nition on my part, in your behalf; in the mean time let it be a secret between you and me; don't tell your wife a word of what is pass'd: I shall take the affair into my own hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, on that condition I will not let her know I have appeal'd to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every husband ought to keep up his consequence and authority; whereas this wou'd only tend to lower you in her respect, as if you had not power of yourself to regulate your own concerns, without calling me in to assist you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very true, I see your motives, and am beholden to you for them. Under your fa∣therly correction, worthy Sir, I may now flatter myself we shall go on better than ever.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! my dear good lady! you are very considerate of me, and have great pity for unhap∣py Sabina; but it is my duty to explain to you my follies as well as my misfortunes: You are too good in crediting me for my innocence, but I will not be a deceiver, tho' I have myself been sacri∣fic'd by deceit.</P>

<P>What do I hear? Has Frederick—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! no, no, no! He is perfection of a man, and if he did know my wrongs, I do believe he wou'd expose his life for my redress; therefore I will not let the name of my betrayer pass my lips, for fear that it shou'd reach his ears.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>How's this, Sabina? Have you been wrong'd, betray'd, and yet did you consent to Frederick's proposal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not for the universe wou'd I consent; for I do know his heart too well, and my own conscience still better. Ah! my dear lady, if you can pity me, a stranger, for my sufferings, what must you feel for his, when you shall know your∣self to have been the cause of them?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I!—I the cause of them?</P>

<P>How cou'd my marriage so affect him? Had he not forsaken me, had he not renounc'd me, I wou'd have suffer'd death ere I wou'd have join'd my hand to any other man's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not how that was, I only know how he did rave when his poor mind was gone, and his life almost at the last moment: I'm sure, if ever woman was ador'd by man, you are by Mr. Frede∣rick; for myself then, if I was free (which I am not) judge if I cou'd in honor marry him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did he not freely offer it? Does he not still most strongly press it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>He presses it in honor, not in heart; and when he offer'd it he was beside himself with rage and disappointment for the loss of you: In fine, my Lady, I do wish I had a friend just now, who wou'd say to Mr. Frederick, that Sabina Rosny cannot, if she wou'd, accept his hand; and further, if she cou'd, for his sake she wou'd not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>And who so fit to say that, as Sabina Rosny herself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! Alas! how difficult for me, how dangerous for him! If I shou'd say how I was treated by a certain person of this country, (I did believe all Englishmen were honest) wou'd he not force me to confess the whole? And then—Oh terrible! Is it not better I shou'd bury my sad story in my heart, and suffer in secret?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>A villain shou'd be dragg'd to light, and punish'd by the world's contempt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let his own conscience be his punish∣ment! Tho' he has ruin'd me, basely betray'd me by a pretended marriage, and then cruelly aban∣don'd me; what can I say or do? Shall a poor alien like me contend with power like his?—Your laws will not redress me; my religion is not his religion: I know not who is that Italian monk that married us; I know not where to find him; or, if I cou'd, what then? My Lord wou'd little care for that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord shall care; doubt not but there are means to make him care, and feel and

<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I ask what shou'd prevent him from paying his addresses to your ladyship?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Simply this—because he has pledg'd them elsewhere, and is too much a man of honor to violate his engagements.</P>

<P>Oh!—if he is engaged elsewhere—that is if—if he is absolutely bound—that alters the ease.</P>

<P>I do indeed—I feel the force of it very thoroughly.</P>

<P>I'm satisfied you do, and I hope you will credit me when I declare to you, upon the word of truth, that if Frederick Mowbray was the one man whom I preferr'd before all men living, and I knew him guilty of having pledg'd his faith to another woman, whom he afterwards abandon'd, I wou'd as soon join hands with infamy, and be the outcast of society, as with such a traitor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>That—that is very strong, Lady Ruby, and bespeaks your utter abhorrence of double-dealing; but you will permit me to observe that much wou'd depend upon who, and what the woman was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wou'd not hear of such a plea, and you, my Lord, wou'd be the last man living to allow of it; 'twou'd be a mere evasion, not a miti∣gation of his guilt—Every mean wretch can blast the reputation of the fond believing victim, whom his unmanly cunning has seduc'd, and his unprin∣cipled inconstancy deserted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>

I most heartily beg your pardon for all the foolish things I have said or done since I had the honor of know∣ing you: I was betray'd into involuntary admira∣tion; it is not easy to reflect within the sphere of your attraction, but I have regain'd my senses, and shall be out of England before three days are at an end.</P>

<P>Ah! Billy, my fine fellow, how fares it with you?</P>

<P>I don't know whether I shall speak to you; I am not sure I shall acknowledge you.</P>

<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heyday! What's in the wind now, my heart of oak? What have I done to offend you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Billy B.</SPEAKER>
<P>What have you done? Inquire of sister Kate; she'll let you know what you have done, and set her claws into your face at the same time for your doings. You have brought a naughty woman into our house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis false.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Billy B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't say so! I have proof positive.—She a virtuous suffering innocent!—She to be married to your brother Mowbray! No such thing, friend David; she is married already, and your honorable brother has made free to steal a march with another man's wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you what, Billy, in one word—either prove what you say, prove it upon the spot, or fall to your prayers and take leave of life, for damn me if you don't tread upon your grave!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Billy B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Read then, and be convinc'd—Here is a trinket sister Kate found in her drawer after she had left us: 'tis the portrait of some gentleman; his name is not to it, but see what is inscribed at the back.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give it me, give it me—I shou'd know this face.—Aha! my Lord, have I discover'd you?—Now for the writing at the back, <HI>"The husband of the forsaken Sabina!"—</HI>Damnation!

<P>Mark me! Don't think at all, for this business belongs to me: Your only part is to be in∣violably secret, husht as death, till I have sifted it to the minutest grain: That done, I will report to you the particulars, and then, as I am sure my brother's honor will come out clear as the light, you must revoke every syllable you have utter'd in∣jurious to his reputation.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>

<P>Because I think your rashness will not attempt to make its passage thro' my body, and there is no other road.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>I comprehend you, and I take your mo∣tive in good part: You see my weakness, you per∣ceive I am relapsing into my former passion for Lady Ruby, and you tremble for the honor I have pledg'd to Sabina Rosny.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right; I tremble for your ho∣nor, I plant myself between you and ruin; and I conjure you, nay, I compel you turn back with me from that house, which will else be the tomb of your happiness, your fortune, and your fame.</P>

<P>I will not treat you as such, but follow you as my guardian genius, sent to snatch me from disgrace; for, alas! I must confess to you I am lost if I behold that syren, who first took possession of my soul.—Come, let us fly! Whither shall we go? Carry me to my sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>To your sister then!—Hav'nt you seen her yet?</P>
</SP>

<P>Step out of it then with me: the open air is common property, and we will talk together man to man.</P>

<P>What does the puppy prattle about?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh Sir, Sir! don't reprove him for his generous indignation against a cruel husband, who oppresses and insults your poor suffering daughter, 'till no longer able to endure her sorrows and his tyranny, she is compell'd to cast herself at your feet, and implore your pity and protection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm thunderstruck! I'm petrified!—This is one fault more, Wrangle, than I thought you had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rise, sister, rise! You are too vehement in your remonstrance; I must believe it is not in this gentleman's nature to oppress or insult an un∣offending wife, which I hope you are; and I am heartily sorry you make our father a party in your little domestic squabbles, which might easily be adjusted without his privity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me your hand, Frederick, you speak like an angel. I am friends with you from this moment for ever.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all means Mr. Wrangle, by all means; no man speaks better when his own faults are the topic, and I do not forget the promise I have made you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>To that promise I now appeal. The cause of Mrs. Wrangle's complaint is simply this—She had ordered her coach to make half a hundred idle visits, and I, in the expectation of her brother's coming, wou'd fain have prevail'd with her to stay at home and receive him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Monstrous prevarication!</P>

<P>Hush, child, hush!—A small stretch upon the truth would have been a softer phrase.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>About my daughter's temper! What is it you mean?—I heard a pretty many broad hints of your own temper, but not one of my daughter's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of my temper, Sir? No; whatever faults there may be in my temper, I owe no ac∣count of them to you; because, if you had taken the smallest pains to know me before I married Miss Mowbray, you must have seen and confess'd I was the last person living to make her happy, or be happy with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you had imparted that to me in good time—Your intelligence, Mr. Wrangle, is rather of the latest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true, Sir; and had you given me leave to chuse a husband for myself, Mr. Wrangle, be assured, is just the very last man in existence, on whom I shou'd have fix'd my choice.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heyday! why then did you both agree in persuading me you were the happiest fondest couple in all England?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>You persuaded yourself: We were miserable enough methinks not to be mistaken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very true: Mrs. Wrangle herself will do me the justice to say I never pretended to be happy with her.</P>
</SP>

<P>No, no, we had both a very sovereign dislike for each other: 'Tis the only point we ever agreed in.</P>

<P>Oh! Sabina, Sabina! you know not what you ask, nor see the ruin you invite upon yourself and me.—If you wou'd wish to preserve my senses, patiently to hear and honorably to decide, take me from hence without a moment's loss.</P>

<P>You are alarm'd for me, my dear dear friend, without a cause. It is my wish, my prayer, my supplication to Heaven for you, that you may be blest and happy all your long life with that charming lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sabina, what have you a mind to make of me? a villain, a betrayer of my word and faith! or a distracted husband without heart or head?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Husband! that cannot be. I tell you now in verity, as I did tell you before, you can∣not be my husband, because—because—Ah me!

ah me! How shall I speak it? I am much ashamed—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Speak, I beseech you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because—I am already married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Married! it cannot be!—Married!—Beware, Sabina; solemnly I adjure you to reflect that my unalterable purpose cannot be dispens'd with. If, because you see me combating a passion that was once my master, you suppose me con∣quer'd, you mistake: my faith, my honor, my confirm'd experience of your virtues never can be shaken, be the trial ever so severe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray you pardon my poor mode of speaking, but I do feel your goodness at my heart—indeed, indeed I do; and be not angry with me, my good friend, for that I did not tell you this be∣fore, but it is true no less—I am a wife—I will not say a happy one, for it was not for me to find a heart like your's; but I will hope the best, for I have not merited to be forsaken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is there a monster living that wou'd for∣sake you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! yes, for I am poor—My family, my fortune perish'd—yet I should not expect a noble Englishman would make my poverty my crime, when there was nothing else that he could urge against me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sabina, I must now believe that you are serious; my part therefore must change with your condition: but, tho' some obligations are dissolv'd, others are left in force, which honor cannot acquit me of—therefore, before I ask the name of your betrayer, be he who may, I solemn∣ly devote myself to your redress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! that is why I tremble to disclose his name.—Oh! my dear friend, I pray you to excuse me this one day. My Lady Ruby flatters me with hopes all shall be well.</P>

<P>Hold, hold sweet supplicant, be not so humble! I will not wound your tender sensibility for all the earth: Compose yourself.</P>

<P>Oh, he is so generous and so kind to poor Sabina, that my heart is fit to break: I do think he is the best man living, and I do know he loves you, my sweet lady—Heaven! how he does love you!—Will you, then, be very angry with me, if I shall be so bold to say, you are the only lady upon earth that does deserve him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! you seducing creature, that is not his opinion; for there is only this distinction be∣tween your fate and mine, that Frederick ran from me before marriage, Lord Sensitive from you after it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Sensitive! I'm thunderstruck,</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>And he'll redeem his honor, be assur'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, or his life must answer it.—I know him well, brave, generous, quick to feel and to resent each breath that glances at his fame—Either there is some error in his brain, or else some vil∣lainous traducer has impos'd on his credulity—I'll probe him to the heart.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Frederick! there are certain cases of the heart, which women are suppos'd to treat better than men—Leave this to me; if he does not receive his cure from under my hands, I'll then consent to turn him over as a desperate case to you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady Ruby, I have remember'd my promise; and as I know your late impressive words were pointed at my heart, I beg leave to assure you they have reach'd it. When I say I am your con∣vert, need I add that I am prepared to make atone∣ment to Sabina Rosny?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I congratulate your lordship on that re∣solution, and am persuaded you can only find your happiness where you have left your honor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll not attempt to varnish my misdeeds, I acknowledge that Sabina Rosny has every requi∣site of merit, birth, and beauty, to engage and fix my heart.—When I left her, on a sudden call to England, I was not guilty of a purpose <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o desert her; my promise of a speedy return was sincerely given—but in the interim—what shall I say? Your candor must supply the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>We'll talk not of the past: Sabina's candor, and your lordship's better thoughts, as soon as you shall meet, will bury all offences in obli∣vion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>You predict flatteringly, but I have many anxious hours to pass before that meeting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>'Tis a long distance between this and Padua; but if your resolution is made up—</P>

<SP>
<PB N="64" REF="63"/>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unalterably—I shall set out within this hour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wait a few moments, then; and tho' I cannot promise you a wind, as witches did of old, I'll do my best to give you a quick passage.—Sit down; your sylph shall be at your elbow before you can well draw a sigh.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can she mean? what project has her active fancy sprung, to back this bold profes∣sion?—Hark! I hear her.—Well, fair sylph, I keep my post, and wait your promis'd favor.—Hah! what now?—Sabina! Heaven uphold me! from what cloud have you dropt down on earth?</P>

<P>Come to my arms! Oh unexpected joy! Now we will part no more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! will you not forsake your poor Sabina any more?—Ah! what sad moments I have pass'd, counting the hours for your return, day after day, but all in vain—No lord, no letter, no hope left at last, no country to receive me, no parents, brothers, friends to fly to: miserable me! I did believe I was renounc'd of Providence, and destin'd to despair.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh my much-injur'd, my acknowledg'd wife!</P>

<P>That has sweet sound with it: my heart is comforted.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>My life shall be devoted to atonement.—Trust me, my sweet Sabina, 'tis not my nature to be base or cruel: once restor'd to your forgiveness, (and methinks your eyes promise me that) I will offend no more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not how to call it an offence; for what am I? My fortune nothing, my nobility a shadow—a heart to honor you is all that I can boast. How, then, can I be angry, if, when re∣turn'd to your own happy country, where so many fairer ladies court your attention, you forgot poor,
<PB N="65" REF="64"/>
humble, lost Sabina?—But of this no more—I have a friend, an honorable, noble friend, to whom I owe this happy meeting; I must take you to him—give me your hand.</P>

<P>Well, Sir, 'tis your own concern; if you are contented with each other, it's a proof you are soon pleas'd. Quarrel when you like, and make it up how you can, you have my leave. I find by late experience that the man who thinks for more heads than he carries on his own shoulders, lays out care for himself, and reaps no thanks for his kindness.</P>

<P>Believe me, my good Sir Miles—</P>

<P>Pardon me, my good Sir Caleb; that is a weakness I am cur'd of.—I was the dupe of credulity, when I believ'd you wou'd make my daughter happv, and when I took your word for your being so: I was the veriest dolt in creation, when I thought I could either qualify your fail∣ings, or compose your squabbles.—I pray you, Sir, be husband and wife in your own way, and never let me be middle man between you, henceforth and for ever.</P>

Frederick, give me your hand; I have to ask your pardon for my folly, in supposing I had a right over your affections, first, by diverting them from the woman of your heart, and secondly by directing them towards her; and all my wonder is, you had the patience to listen to my nonsensical authority in either instance.—I have also an apology to make to that amiable lady for a most impertinent visit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>That amiable lady thinks the apology ra∣ther due for her reception of you, than for your visit to her; and before many minutes are gone by, I expect she will be here to tell you so.</P>

<P>My lady Ruby, this is indeed an ho∣nor and a happiness—and a—My Lord, I am

your most obedient; may I request to be made known to this fair stranger?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>This fair stranger, Sir Miles, whom I have the honor to call wife, is ambitious to pay her compliments to the father of her best friend, and my greatest benefactor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, truly, Sir, I am very happy to make my humble obeisance to you, for the sake of your honorable son, my very good friend, Mr. Frederick Mowbray; for whose favors I have not the words to speak my gratitude, tho' I have a heart, that will never cease to feel them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord S.</SPEAKER>
<P>If such be your gratitude, lovely Sabi∣na, what shou'd mine be to those friends of honor, who have restor'd you to my heart, and bless'd me with a prospect of that state of happiness, which I truly hope the married part of this company will continue to enjoy, and the unmarried make haste to obtain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brother Wrangle, there's one wish for you and my sister, part it between you.—And brother Frederick, was I as you, I wou'd drop down on both my knees to my sweet Lady Ruby, and beg to go halves in the other wish with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if my prayers cou'd profit, for his sake I wou'd kneel and pray, till some kind saint, that favors virtuous love, shou'd hear me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(kneeling)</STAGE>
<P>Oh! more than ever dear, long-lost, lamented, and despair'd of even to distracti∣on; has your once-tender heart, wean'd by time, or alienated by suspicion, forgot its former feelings?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rise, Frederick, explanations of this nature shou'd be private; yet I will freely own, in presence of this company, 'twas the abrupt and se∣cret manner of your leaving me, which I could not reconcile to that generous sensibility I gave you credit for.—Did you write me one letter from abroad?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Several, many.—Did you answer one?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="68" REF="67"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>As truth shall judge me, not a line of your's ever reach'd my hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish to my soul they had pass'd through mine; I wou'd have stak'd my life for the delive∣ry of them.—Father, I shou'd like to know if any body here present cou'd give an account of those same unlucky letters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say no more, say no more—My con∣science flies in my face: but a man can do no more than own it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have done—This only let me assert, in vindication of the truth, that I ceas'd not from the tenderest expostulations on your silence, im∣ploring you to keep me in your thoughts, and pro∣mising eternal constancy on my part, till I heard you was married—then I confess I was not hypo∣crite enough to send you my congratulations—my exhausted spirits sunk under the shock of that in∣telligence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here let us pause.—You have a zealous advocate, from whom I have heard the rest.—I have now only to apologize to Sir Miles Mowbray for my reception of his visit, which if he is not discourag'd to repeat, I can only assure him that the same proposal will not be treated with the same indifference.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am infinitely happy to hear you say so; but really, Madam, I am so confounded and asham'd of my past mistakes in cases of the heart, that I dare not venture upon more than putting up a prayer in secret for your happiness, and my son's. Hitherto I have been an officious, and I fear an unfortunate father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suffer me for a moment to interrnpt your self-reproaches, so far at least as they apply to me.—I now declare from my soul, that if a second choice was in my power, I would volun∣tarily fix it where you first directed it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I protest, with equal and unfeign'd sincerity, that, brought to recollection by this scene, and resolute to emulate the examples I
<PB N="69" REF="68"/>
behold, my life shall be devoted to the blessing you bestowed upon me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excellently resolv'd on both sides! I only hope you will not want me to put you in mind of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>We all join in that hope.—Peace at home, for your sakes, ye happy husbands—war abroad for mine, and yours, my gallant com∣rades!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Corrected by experience, I will now venture to pronounce, that <HI>First Love</HI> is a faithful guide; and the parent, who attempts to turn that stream from its course, makes himselfe responsible for all the miseries and miscarriages, that may re∣sult from his diversion of it.</P>

<L>TO you, fair Ladies, and, kind Sirs, to you,</L>
<L>Circle so brilliant, and to me so new,</L>

<L>In verity I thank you, and am sure,</L>
<L>Lodg'd in your bosoms I may sleep secure:</L>
<L>Blels your brave hearts, happy may you remain,</L>
<L>Tho' my poor country bleeds in ev'ry vein!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah woe the time! and, therefore, 'tis I see</L>
<L>So many pitying eyes are turn'd on me;</L>
<L>So kind they look, as if they wou'd impart</L>
<L>Some of their own brave spirit to my heart:</L>
<L>And where's the wonder, as the case appears,</L>
<L>If those who rule the waves shou'd calm our fears?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! generous nation, pardon if I say</L>
<L>What my poor thoughts suggest in my poor way;</L>
<L>But I do think that Heav'n ordain'd a nest</L>
<L>On your white cliffs where halcyon peace may rest,</L>
<L>Sever'd one spot of consecrated ground,</L>
<L>And bade old Neptune roll his waves around:</L>

<L>But it is not for humble me to speak</L>
<L>Of things so great, with faculties so weak;</L>
<L>Enough that when I came, forsaken, poor,</L>
<L>A wand'ring emigrant, and sought your door,</L>
<L>Your generous favor gave me a retreat</L>
<L>Where the Muse haunts, and where the Graces meet,</L>
