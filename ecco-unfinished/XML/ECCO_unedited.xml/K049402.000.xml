<HEAD>EPISTLE
TO
Sir JOHN PRINGLE,
President of the ROYAL SOCIETY.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are few persons who
rival Sir John Pringle in
my esteem: there are still fewer
whose friendship I value more. It
is not, however, my purpose in this
letter, to proclaim these things to
the world; for what concern has
the world with private connec∣tions?
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
Ambition to have the
patronage of the Royal Society
to this work, is my motive for
addressing you in this public man∣ner.
The plan it recommends,
has been my guide many years;
and success has left me no doubt
of its solidity. Your sanction,
my friend, will ensure it a gra∣cious
reception, from a body of
learned men, who have distin∣guished
your literary merit by the
greatest honour they have to be∣stow.
It is my servent desire to
be useful to my country: the
stamp of that illustrious Society,
will give a currency to the work:
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
every one will read; and every
sensible farmer will profit by it.</P>
<P>Agriculture justly claims to be
the chief of arts: it enjoys beside
the signal pre-eminence, of com∣bining
deep philosophy with use∣ful
practice. The members of
your Society, cannot employ their
talents more profitably for their
country, or more honourably for
themselves, than in promoting and
improving an art, to which Bri∣tain
fundamentally is indebted for
the figure it makes all the world
over.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
The theory here suggested, is
in some measure new: it belongs
to the Royal Society to deter∣mine,
whether it be founded on
solid principles. It will give me
entire satisfaction, to be counte∣nanced
by a Society, which has
contributed more to promote na∣tural
knowledge, than any other
society existing, or that ever did
exist.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>BEHOLD another volume on husbandry! ex∣claims
a peevish man on seeing the title∣page:
how long shall we be pestered with such
trite stuff? “As long, sweet Sir, as you are
willing to pay for it: hold out your purse, and
wares will never be wanting.”</P>
<P>It must indeed be acknowledged, that the com∣merce
of books is carried on with no great degree
of candour: those of husbandry, with very little.
A bookseller contrives a new title, collects books
upon the subject, delivers them to his author to
pick and cull; and, “Here, Sir, is a spick and
span new work, full of curious matter.” A∣griculture
is the prime of arts: every thing is
made welcome on that subject; and provided the
title be new, it is to the bookseller of no great
importance, how threadbare the contents be.</P>
<P>Writers on agriculture, very few excepted,
deliver their precepts from a study lined with
books, without even pretending to experience.
Principles and propositions are assumed on the au∣thority
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
of former writers: opinions pass current
from generation to generation; and no person
enquires whether they wear the livery of truth.
Take the following short specimen, drawn from a
single head, that of manures. Writers talk learn∣edly
of lime, stone-marl, clay-marl, shell-marl,
and of other manures; and foretell how they will
operate upon soil, with the same assurance as if
they could penetrate into their nature and essence.
“Clay-marl,” say they, “has more power to
destroy acids and to produce salts, than stone-marl:
<HI>ergo,</HI> a less quantity of it upon land is
sufficient. Marl extracts grease out of woollen
cloth: grease is a species of oil: <HI>ergo,</HI> marl
extracts oil from the air. A greater quantity
of marl is laid on land, than of lime: <HI>ergo,</HI> it
must have a greater effect in attracting vege∣table
food from the air. Shell-marl found un∣der
moss, is compounded of earth and the al∣kaline
salt of rotten wood. Because clay is
mixed with sand in making brick, that mixture
must be an enemy to vegetation. The mixing
earth and lime with dung, makes an excellent
compost. Rain makes flinty sand firmer and
more compact,” &amp;c. &amp;c. Some of these pro∣positions
are erroneous, some at best doubtful.
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
And yet, they are but a few of many propositions,
boldly asserted by writers, though they would re∣quire
the elucidation of a Newton or a Boyle.
So much I will vouch for myself, that I have not
mentioned a single article as certain, but what I
have practised many years with success: the in∣structions
contained in this book, are founded on
repeated experiments and diligent observation. If
any particular happens to be mentioned that has
not come under my inspection, the reader is
warned of it. In short, it will soon be perceived,
that this is not a bookseller's production.</P>
<P>The dawn of a manufacture, is irksomely slow
in its progress to broad day. Indocility is difficult
to be overcome: habitual indolence, still more.
These obstructions vanish in a manufacturing
country. A boy learns by sight his father's trade,
even before he can ply his little hand about an
instrument. He acquires activity by seeing others
active: he comprehends not what it is to be idle.
This observation is strongly exemplified in agri∣culture.
Some years ago, farmers in Scotland
were ignorant and indolent; nothing to be seen
but weeds and trash, not a single field in order.
People habituated to such objects, never once
thought of doing better. Skill in agriculture is
<PB N="x" REF="9"/>
spreading gradually in Scotland; and young peo∣ple
acquire some knowledge by sight, even before
they think of practice. After such advance, may
we not hope, that our progress will now be ra∣pid;
and that agriculture will soon be as familiar
among us, and as skilfully conducted, as in Eng∣land?
May this reflection animate our landed
gentry; and inflame them with a desire, to ac∣quire
riches to themselves and lustre to their
country.</P>
<P>There certainly never was in Scotland a period,
when good lessons in husbandry were more sea∣sonable
than at present. This country, growing
in population, affords not corn sufficient for its in∣habitants;
and yet waste land abounds, which
some skill and much industry would fertilize. Is
it not deplorable, that in the best-cultivated shires,
large patches of land should produce nothing but
broom and whins, not from barrenness but from
indolence? Can greater encouragement to in∣dustry
be wished, than a ready market for every
thing the soil produces? how different from the
condition of Scotland, not more than forty years
ago! Can a landholder be employed more pro∣fitably
for his country, or more honourably as well
as profitably for himself, than to rouse emulation
<PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
among his tenants, by kind treatment, by instruc∣tion,
by example, and by premiums? Let him
study the rules contained in this little work, all
of them plain and adapted to practice. Let him
convene his tenants once a-year to a hearty meal,
and engage them to follow these rules. What
if he should bestow on the deserving, a plough
or a brake of the best construction? Land can∣not
be improved at a cheaper rate. It was by
such means, that the late John Cockburn of Or∣mistown,
promoted emulation and industry among
his people. His patriotic zeal was rewarded: he
lived to see his estate in a higher degree of culti∣vation,
than even to this day is seen in any other
part of Scotland. The same means were employ∣ed
more extensively, by the late Earl of Findla∣ter:
the skill and perseverance of that nobleman,
raised his tenants from a torpid state, to a surpri∣sing
degree of activity; and few can now vie with
them, either for industry or knowledge. Had o∣ther
landlords been equally active, how flourishing
would agriculture have been in Scotland? Great
sums would annually have been received for corn;
instead of being imported for ready money, a
commodity that can very ill be spared. The field
is still open: let us join hearts and hands to re∣deem
<PB N="xii" REF="11"/>
time wofully mispent. I say again, there
never was in Scotland, a period more favourable
to agriculture than the present.</P>
<P>Agriculture is a very ancient art. It has been
practised every where without intermission; but
with very little attention to principles. In study∣ing
the principles laid down by writers, I found
myself in a sort of labyrinth, carried to and fro
without any certain direction. After a long course
of reading, where there was nothing but dark∣ness
and discrepance, I laid aside my books, took
heart, and like Des Cartes commenced my in∣quiries
with doubting of every thing. I resorted
to the book of nature: I studied it with atten∣tion:
and the second part of this work contains
the result of my inquiries. It is far from my
thoughts, to impose my opinions upon others: I
pretend only to have reduced the theory of agri∣culture
into a sort of system, more concise at
least, and more consistent, than has been done
by other writers. Many eyes are better than
one; and if my theory shall be found erroneous,
the many that have erred before, will serve in
some measure to keep me in countenance. I am
not however afraid of any grofs error. An <HI>im∣primatur</HI>
from one of the ablest chymists of the
<PB N="xiii" REF="12"/>
present age, has given me some confidence of be∣ing
in the right tract<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr Black professor of chymistry in the college of Edinburgh.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have all along studied brevity, as far as con∣sistent
with perspicuity; and therefore, have con∣fined
myself to matters, that I know to be of real
use in practice. I am ambitious to have my plan
followed, because successful experience has pro∣ved
it to be solid: but I should not hope for many
readers, if I hazarded the tiring them with unne∣cessary
matters. Varro <HI>de re rustica,</HI> appears to
be very sparing of instruction; but rivals Aristotle
himself in the subtilety of his divisions. “Nunc
dicam agri quibus rebus colantur. Quas res
alii dividunt in duas partes, in homines et admi∣nicula
hominum: sine quibus rebus colere non
possunt. Alii in tres partes, instrumenti ge∣nus
vocale, et semivocale, et mutum. Vocale,
in quo sunt servi: semivocale, in quo sunt bo∣ves
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> multum, in quo sunt plaustra.” Such
puerile divisions, may be of use to swell a vo∣lume;
but give no instruction, and are extremely
tiresome.</P>
<P>I cannot finish this preface without warmly re∣commending
agriculture to gentlemen of land-estates;
<PB N="xiv" REF="13"/>
for whose use chiefly this work is intend∣ed.
In every well-governed state, agriculture has
been duly honoured. In ancient Persia, a festi∣val
was yearly celebrated, in which husbandmen
were freely admitted to the King's table. “From
your labours, said the King, we receive our
sustenance; and by us you are protected. Be∣ing
mutually necessary to each other, let us,
like brethren, live together in amity.” The
great emperor of China, performs yearly the ce∣remony
of holding the plough, to show that no
man is above being a farmer. The island Mile∣tus,
during many years, had been afflicted with
factions: the government was settled by some
wise men of Paros, a neighbouring island. These
men having surveyed the island, and marked the
possessor of every well-cultivated farm, convo∣cated
an assembly of the people, and appoint∣ed
these persons to be governors. “The per∣son,”
said they, “who governs his pri∣vate
affairs with prudence and industry, is
qualified to govern those of the public.” The
king of Tunis, invaded by a powerful enemy,
promised to a neighbour who assisted him, the
philosopher's stone. He sent a plough, saying,
That a plough was virtually the philosopher's
<PB N="xv" REF="14"/>
stone; for that it would produce rich crops, to
procure gold in plenty.</P>
<P>In the view of profit, agriculture is fit for
every man. But my present view is to re∣commend
it, as of all occupations the most pro∣per
for gentlemen in a private station. Mat∣ter
crouds upon me; and I am at a loss where
to begin. Agriculture corresponds to that degree
of exercise, which is the best preservative of
health. It requires no hurtful fatigue, on the one
hand, nor indulges, on the other, indolence,
still more hurtful. During a throng of work, the
diligent farmer will sometimes be early and late
in the field: but this is no hardship upon an ac∣tive
spirit. At other times, a gentleman who
conducts his affairs properly, may have hours e∣very
day, to bestow on reading, on his family, on
his friends.</P>
<P>Agriculture is equally salutary to the mind. In
the management of a farm, constant attention is
required to the soil, to the season, and to differ∣ent
operations. A gentleman thus occupied, be∣comes
daily more active, and is daily gathering
knowledge: as his mind is never suffered to lan∣guish,
he is secure against the disease of low
spirits.</P>
<P>But what I chiefly insist on is, that laying aside
<PB N="xvi" REF="15"/>
irregular appetites and ambitious views, agricul∣ture
is of all occupations the most consonant to
our nature; and the most productive of content∣ment,
the sweetest sort of happiness. In the first
place, it requires that moderate degree of exer∣cise,
which corresponds the most to the ordinary
succession of our perceptions. Fox-hunting pro∣duces
a succession too rapid: angling produces a
succession too slow. Agriculture corresponds not
only more to the ordinary succession, but has the
following signal property, that the farmer can di∣rect
his operations, with that degree of quickness
and variety, which is the best suited to his own
train of perceptions. In the next place, to every
occupation that can give a lasting relish, hope and
fear are essential. A fowler has little enjoyment
in his gun, who misses frequently; and he loses
all enjoyment, when every shot is death: a
poacher, so dextrous, may have pleasure in the
profit, but none in the art. The hopes and fears
that attend agriculture, keep the mind always a∣wake,
and in an enlivening degree of agitation.
Hope never approache certainty so near, as to
produce security; nor is fear ever so great, as to
create deep anxiety and distress. Hence it is,
that a gentleman farmer, tolerably skilful, never
<PB N="xvii" REF="16"/>
tires of his work; but is as keen the last moment
as the first. Can any other employment compare
with farming in that respect? In the third place,
no other occupation rivals agriculture, in connect∣ing
private interest with that of the public. How
pleasing to think, that every step a man makes
for his own good, promotes that of his country!
Even where the balance happens to turn against
the farmer, he has still the comfort that his country
profits by him. Every gentleman-farmer must of
course be a patriot; for patriotism, like other vir∣tues,
is improved and fortified by exercise. In
fact, if there be any remaining patriotism in a na∣tion,
it is found among that class of men.</P>
<P>A gentleman-farmer who is disposed to embel∣lish
his fields, has a great advantage over others.
He can execute that pleasing work at the cheapest
rate, by employing upon it his farm servants and
cattle, every vacant hour. This slow method is
indeed ill suited to the ardour of an Indian Na∣bob,
impatient for enjoyment. But is not the
advantage clearly on the side of the farmer? The
refined pleasure of embellishments, arises from a
slow progress; which affords leisure to feast the
eye upon every new production.</P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="17"/>
In former times, hunting was the only business
of a gentleman. The practice of blood made him
rough and hard-hearted: he led the life of a dog,
or of a savage; violently active in the field, su∣pinely
indolent at home. His train of ideas was
confined to dogs, horses, hares, foxes: not a ra∣tional
idea entered the train, not a spark of pa∣triotism,
nothing done for the public, his depend∣ents
enslaved and not fed, no husbandry, no em∣bellishment,
loathsome weeds round his dwelling,
disorder and dirt within. Consider the present
mode of living. How delightful the change,
from the hunter to the farmer, from the destroyer
of animals to the feeder of men! Our gentle∣men
who live in the country, have become active
and industrious farmers. They embellish their
fields, improve their lands, and give bread to
thousands. Every new day promotes health and
spirits; and every new day brings variety of en∣joyment.
They are happy at home; and they
wish happiness to all.</P>
<P>As the scene of the author's experience has
all along been in Scotland, his native coun∣try,
<PB N="xix" REF="18"/>
he is shy to recommend his plan of hus∣bandry
to any but to his countrymen. He
has, however, a thorough conviction, that giving
allowance for slight variations of climate, his
plan will suit England, France, Italy, and every
other country situated within either of the tempe∣rate
zones.</P>
<P>IN arts and sciences, a plentiful source of ob∣scurity
and indistinctness, is the using a word in
different senses, without warning the reader of it.
Considering what volumes have been composed on
agriculture, it is amazing, how little precision is
in the terms of art. Take the following instance.
The word <HI>furrow</HI> is employed to signify not only
the hollow made by the plough, but the earth
taken out of that hollow, and also the hollow be∣tween
ridges. Better coin words than write in∣distinctly.
Let <HI>furrow</HI> be appropriated to the
space in which the plough moves, and also to the
hollow between ridges; which will not occasion
any confusion. But I venture to distinguish the
earth moved by the plough, by the name of the
<HI>furrow-slice.</HI> The small hollows that appear be∣tween
<PB N="xx" REF="19"/>
the slices when a ridge is ploughed, may
be termed <HI>seams.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nota bene,</HI> The English acre, the Linlith∣gow
measure, the Dutch weight, are to be un∣derstood,
where the contrary is not specified.</P>

<HEAD>THE
GENTLEMAN
FARMER.</HEAD>
<P>NAtural History is confined to effects,
leaving causes to Natural Philosophy.
From a number of effects, Natural
Philosophy ascends by induction to the
immediate cause; and from such causes to what
are more comprehensive. Most writers on hus∣bandry
handle it as a branch of Natural History.
Some, more bold, consider it as also a branch of
Natural Philosophy: they begin with effects, and
endeavour to unfold the causes or principles. In
addressing this treatise to Gentlemen, I attempt
both. This suggests a division into two parts. In
the first part, which indeed is the most useful, the
best practice in every branch of husbandry is care∣fully
explained. In the second, with timid steps
and slow, I endeavour to trace out a few causes or
principles that have an immediate influence upon
practice.</P>

from the handles to the extremity of the beam,
and commonly above four feet from the back end
of the head to the point of the sock. It is termed
the <HI>Scotch plough,</HI> to distinguish it from other
forms; and it needs no particular description, as
it may be seen in every field. It may well be
termed the <HI>Scotch plough;</HI> for of all forms it is
the fittest for breaking up stiff and rough land, e∣specially
where stones abound; and no less fit for
strong clays hardened by drought. The length
of its head gives it a firm hold of the ground: its
weight prevents it from being thrown out by
stones: the length of the handles gives the plough∣man
great command to direct its motion: and
by the length of its head, and of its mould∣board,
it lays the furrow-slice cleverly over. The
Scotch plough was contrived during the infancy of
agriculture, and was well contrived: in the soils
above described, it has not an equal.</P>
<P>But in tender soil it is improper, because it adds
greatly to the expence of ploughing, without any
counterbalancing benefit. The length of the head
and mouldboard encrease the friction, and con∣sequently
it requires a greater number of oxen or
horses than are necessary in a shorter plough. There
is another particular in its form, that resists the
draught: the mouldboard makes an angle with
the sock, instead of making a line with it gently
curving backward. There is an objection against
it no less solid, that it does not stir the ground
<PB N="4" REF="28"/>
perfectly: the hinder part of the wrist rises a foot
above the sole of the head: and the earth that lies
immediately below that hinder part, is left unstir∣red.
This is ribbing land below the surface, si∣milar
to what is done by ignorant farmers on the
surface.</P>
<P>These defects must be submitted to in a soil that
requires a strong heavy plough; but may be a∣voided
in a cultivated soil by a plough differently
constructed. Of all the ploughs fitted for a culti∣vated
soil free of stones, I boldly recommend a
plough introduced into Scotland about twelve years
ago, by James Small in Blackadder Mount, Ber∣wickshire;
which is now in great request; and
with great reason, as it avoids all the defects of
the Scotch plough. The shortness of its head and
of its mouldboard lessen the friction greatly: from
the point of the sock to the back part of the
head it is only thirty inches; and the whole
length, from the point of the beam to the end of
the handles, between eight and nine feet. The
sock and mouldboard make one line gently cur∣ving;
and consequently gather no earth. In∣stead
of a wrist, the under edge of the mould∣board
is in one plain with the sole of the head;
which makes a wide furrow, without leaving any
part unstirred. It is termed the <HI>chain-plough,</HI> be∣cause
it is drawn by an iron chain fixed to the back
part of the beam immediately before the coulter.
This has two advantages: first, by means of a
<PB N="5" REF="29"/>
muzzle it makes the plough go deep, or shallow;
and, next, it stresses the beam less than if fixed
to the point, and therefore a slenderer beam is
sufficient. These particulars will be better under∣stood
from inspecting the annexed figure.</P>
<P>This plough may well be considered as a capital
improvement; not only by saving expence, but
by making better work. It is proper for loams,
for carse clays, and, in general, for every sort of
tender soil free of stones. It is even proper for
opening up pasture-ground, where the soil has
been formerly well cultivated.</P>
<P>To finish an account of the plough, I must add
a word about the sock. A spiked sock is used in
the Scotch plough, and is essential in stony land.
But a feathered sock ought always to be used in
tender soil, free of stones: it cuts the earth in the
furrow, and makes neat work. It is indispen∣sable
in ground where roots abound, as it cuts
them below the surface, and prevents their grow∣ing.
I esteem the feathered sock to be a valuable
improvement. The industrious farmer would even
borrow money to clear his ground of stones, in
order to introduce it: in a twenty-years lease, the
profit of it would repay the expence tenfold.</P>
<P>Some ploughs are made with two small wheels
running in the furrow, in order to take off the
friction of the head; and this plough is recom∣mended
in a book, intitled, <HI>The complete farmer.</HI>
But all complicated ploughs are baubles; and this
<PB N="6" REF="30"/>
as much as any. The pivots of such wheels are
always going wrong; and beside, they are choked
so with earth, as to increase the friction instead of
diminishing it.</P>
<P>If we look back thirty years, ploughs of differ∣ent
constructions did not enter even into a dream.
The Scotch plough was universally used; and no
other was known. There was no less ignorance as
to the number of cattle necessary for this plough.
In the south of Scotland, six oxen and two horses
were universal; and in the north, ten oxen, some∣times
twelve. The first attempt to lessen the num∣ber
of oxen, was in Berwickshire. The low part
of that county abounds with stone, clay, and marl,
the most substantial of all manures, which had
been long used by one or two gentlemen. About
twenty-five years ago it acquired reputation, and
spread rapidly. As two horses and two oxen were
employed in every marl-cart; the farmer, in sum∣mer-fallowing
and in preparing land for marl,
was confined to four oxen and two horses. And
as that manure afforded plenty of succulent straw
for oxen, the farmer was surprised to find, that
four oxen did better now than six formerly.
Marling, however, a laborious work, proceeded
slowly, till people were taught by a noted farmer
in that country, what industry can perform by
means of power properly applied. It was recknon∣ed
a mighty task to marl five or six acres in a
year. That gentleman, by plenty of red clover
<PB N="7" REF="31"/>
for his working-cattle, accomplished the marling
fifty acres in a summer, once fifty-four. Having
so much occasion for oxen, he tried with success
two oxen and two horses in a plough; and that
practice became general in Berwickshire.</P>
<P>Now here appears with lustre the advantage of
the chain-plough. The great friction occasioned
in the Scotch plough by a long head, and by the
angle it makes with the mould-board, necessarily
requires two oxen and two horses, whatever the
soil be. The friction is so much less in the chain-plough,
that two good horses are found sufficient
in every soil that is proper for it. And as good
luck seldom comes alone more than bad, the re∣ducing
the draught to a couple of horses has an∣other
advantage, that of rendering a driver unne∣cessary;
no slight saving at present, where a ser∣vant's
wages and maintenance are very smart ar∣ticles.
This saving on every plough, where two
horses and two oxen were formerly used, will by
the strictest computation be fifteen pounds Ster∣ling
yearly; and where four horses were used, no
less than twenty pounds Sterling. There is now
scarce to be seen in the low country of Berwick∣shire
a plough with more than two horses; which
undoubtedly in time will become general. I
know but of one further improvement, that of
using two oxen instead of two horses. That
draught has been employed with success in several
places; and the saving is so great, that it must
<PB N="8" REF="32"/>
force its way every where. I boldly affirm, that
no soil stirred in a proper season, can ever require
more than two horses and two oxen, in a plough,
even supposing the stiffest clay. In all other soils,
two good horses, or two good oxen abreast, may
be relied on for every operation of the chain-plough.</P>
<P>A chain-plough of a smaller size than ordinary,
drawn by a single horse, is of all the most proper
for horse-hoeing, supposing the land to be mellow,
which it ought to be for that operation. It is suf∣ficient
for making furrows to receive the dung,
for ploughing the drills after dunging, and for hoe∣ing
the crop.</P>
<P>A still smaller plough of the same kind, I warm∣ly
recommend for a kitchen-garden. It can be
reduced to the smallest size, by being made of
iron; and where the land is properly dressed for a
kitchen-garden, an iron plough drawn by a horse
of the smallest size will save much spade-work.
Strange is the effect of custom without thought!
Thirty years ago, a kitchen-garden was an article
of luxury merely, because at that time there could
be no cheaper food than oat-meal. At present,
the farmer maintains his servants at double expence,
as the price of oat-meal is doubled; and yet he
has no notion of a kitchen-garden, more than he
had thirty years ago. He never thinks, that li∣ving
partly on cabbage, kail, turnip, carrot,
would save much oat-meal: nor does he ever
<PB N="9" REF="33"/>
think, that change of food is more wholesome,
than vegetables alone, or oat-meal alone. I need
not recommend potatoes, which in our late scanty
crops of corn have proved a great blessing: with∣out
them the labouring poor would frequently
have been reduced to a starving condition.
Would the farmer but cultivate his kitchen-garden
with as much industry as he bestows on
his potato-crop, he needed never fear want;
and he can cultivate it with the iron plough at a
very small expence. It may be held by a boy of
twelve or thirteen; and would be a proper educa∣tion
for a ploughman. But it is the landlord who
ought to give a beginning to the improvement.
A very small expence would enclose an acre for a
kitcken-garden to each of his tenants; and it
would excite their industry, to bestow an iron
plough on those who do best.</P>
<P>Nor is this the only case where a single-horse
plough may be profitably employ'd. It is suffi∣cient
for seed-furrowing barley, where the land
is light and well dressed. It may be used in the
second or third ploughing of fallow, to encourage
annual weeds, which are destroy'd in subsequent
ploughings.</P>
<P>To procure food is indeed the chief object of
the plough, but not its only object. Good roads
are essential to internal commerce; and the ex∣pence
of making them may be considerably lessen∣ed
by the plough. As this hitherto has been
<PB N="10" REF="34"/>
little thought of, an explanation is necessary. The
method in use is, to form a road with the pick,
the spade, and the wheelbarrow. Even where
the pick is not necessary, you see ten or twelve
men pressing down the spade with the foot oftener
than once before a sufficient load of earth can be
raised;—dearly bought by the workmen, and
still more dearly by the employer. Where a pick
is necessary, there must be a great addition of
hands; for ten pickmen are no more than suffi∣cient
to loosen what can be thrown up with four
or five spades. Now a great part of this labour
may be saved by a plough. The Scotch plough,
fortified with iron plates, and the head connected
with the beam by a bar of iron, is an excellent
instrument for making roads. Suppose a new
road is purposed thirty feet wide, plough it up
into a ridge, beginning in the middle; and plough
it a second time in the same manner. Where the
ground is soft, and requires to be raised high, a
very deep furrow is necessary. Where the ground
is firm, a shallow furrow is sufficient. After these
two ploughings are finished, if the sides of the
road be too steep, leave six feet in the middle,
and go round the remainder in a third ploughing,
gathering it toward the top. If the sides be still
too steep, leave twelve feet in the middle, and
gather up the remainder as in the former plough∣ing.
If these operations be well conducted, the
water-channels on each side of the road will be
<PB N="11" REF="35"/>
two feet lower than the surface of the adjacent
ground. Smooth the road with a brake; and
correct with a spade any remaining defects or in∣equalities,
which is a very easy work. Thus the
road is completely formed for a covering of gravel,
or of stones beat small.</P>
<P>A plough may also be used advantageously in
making ditches for enclosing. In hard or gra∣velly
soil, the immense cost of picking and spading
may be totally saved by the plough. The sur∣face-earth
is commonly soft: after it is removed
with the spade, let a plough, drawn by three hor∣ses
in a line, go round and round the space in∣tended
for the ditch, cleaving it as if it were a
ridge. After the earth thus loosened is thrown up
with the shovel, renew the ploughing and shovel∣ling
till you come within eight inches of the bot∣tom;
and to these eight inches apply the pick and
spade. One precaution is necessary, that no more
be ploughed at a time than can be thrown up
the same day. If rain fall in any quantity, the
ground tilled will become mud, very improper to
be laid upon thorns. In this operation there is
no occasion for the coulter: it is rather an impedi∣ment.
I esteem this a valuable discovery for Scot∣land;
which being more pestered with high winds
than England, requires more to be enclosed. The
expence of inclosing with hedge and ditch the or∣dinary
way, is great; and the ditch is the most
expensive part. Two thirds of the expence may
<PB N="12" REF="36"/>
be saved by the plough, in ground that requires
picking.</P>
<P>In every case where earth is to be removed,
the plough is useful; as for example in a gravel-pit
opened for high-roads. The gravel may be so
loosened by the plough as to require a shovel only
for filling it into the carts.</P>
<P>Has any one stumbled on the thought of using
the plough in planting young trees? The method
I have practised, is to mark out lines due north
and south, at intervals of ten or twelve feet. Let
three furrows be made with the plough at the side
of each line. Lay the sod of the eastmost furrow
upon the other two, which will raise a wall above
two feet high. Plant along the furrow from
whence the sod was removed, and the wall behind
will make good shelter. This method is chiefly
intended for firs in a bare moor. Before the firs
rise much above the shelter, the roots will have
taken such hold of the ground as to resist even
westerly winds: scarce a plant will fail, if they be
wholsome. Three thousand firs planted in this
manner may be sufficient for an acre, equal to five
or six thousand in the ordinary way.</P>
<P>A fir makes a choice nurse for other trees. Af∣ter
three years, even in the poorest soil, the firs
begin to grow with vigour; and then is the time
for planting oaks, elms, or other trees among
them; cutting down the firs from time to time to
make room for the other trees. Thus, the me∣thod
<PB N="13" REF="37"/>
here pointed out for planting firs, is the best
preparation for raising all other barren trees.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>2. The BRAKE.</HEAD>
<P>THE brake is a large and weighty harrow, the
purpose of which is to reduce a stubborn soil,
where an ordinary harrow makes little impression.
It consists of four square bulls, each side five
inches, and six feet and a half in length. The
teeth are seventeen inches long, bending forward
like a coulter. Four of them are inserted into
each bull, fixed above with a screw-nut, having
twelve inches free below, with a heel close to the
under part of the bull, to prevent it from being
pushed back by stones. The nut above makes it
easy to be taken out for sharping. This brake
requires four horses or four oxen. One of a lesser
size will not fully answer the purpose: one of a
larger size will require six oxen; in which case
the work may be performed at less expence with
the plough. See the figure annexed.</P>
<P>This instrument may be applied to great advan∣tage
in the following circumstances. In the fal∣lowing
strong clay that requires frequent plough∣ings,
a brakeing between every ploughing, will
pulverize the soil, and render the subsequent
ploughings more easy. In the month of March
or April, when strong ground is ploughed for
barley, especially if bound with couch-grass, a
<PB N="14" REF="38"/>
cross brakeing is preferable to a cross-ploughing,
and is done at half the expence. When ground
is ploughed from the state of nature, and after a
competent time is cross-ploughed, the brake is ap∣plied
with great success, immediately after the cross-ploughing,
to reduce the whole to proper tilth.</P>
<P>Let it be observed, that a brake with a greater
number of teeth than above mentioned, is im∣proper
for ground that is bound together by the
roots of plants, which is always the case of ground
new broken up from its natural state. The brake
is soon choked, and can do no execution till freed
from the earth it holds. A less number of teeth
would be deficient in pulverizing the soil.</P>
<P>To set in a clear light the advantages of this
instrument, we will stop a little to observe how
insufficient the common harrow is for any of the
operations mentioned. It may answer for cover∣ing
the feed, and may do tolerably well in light
and free soil; but is altogether insufficient for re∣ducing
stiff soil. The harrow with wooden teeth
is a ridiculous instrument, fit to raise laughter in∣stead
of raising mould. The poor farmer labours
with it, thinks he is doing an useful work, when
all the time he is doing nothing. It ought to be
prohibited by the landlord; for a tenant with
such an instrument cannot pay a rent that the
farm properly cultivated will easily bear. Tho'
the brake has been known above twenty years,
yet none but gentlemen, and a few select tenants,
<PB REF="39"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="15" REF="40"/>
have ever thought of it: in some counties even
the name remains unknown. It belongs to gen∣tlemen
of fortune, for their own interest, to make
it more general. The necessity of some instru∣ment,
more effectual than the common harrow,
for reducing a stubborn soil, has led farmers to
put three or four harrows, one above another, in
order to press the undermost into the ground.
This substitute to the brake is far inferior in its
effect; beside, that the undermost harrow is torn
to pieces in an instant. To conclude this article,
a farmer who has no brake, wants a capital in∣strument
of husbandry. Its price above that of
common harrows, bears no proportion to the
profit.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>3. The HARROW.</HEAD>
<P>HARROWS are commonly considered as of no
use but to cover the seed. They have another
use scarce less essential, which is to prepare land
for the seed. This is an article of importance
for producing a good crop. And to shew how
imperfectly either of these purposes is performed
by the common harrow, take the following ac∣count
of it.</P>
<P>The harrow commonly used is of different
forms. The first I shall mention has two bulls,
four feet long and eighteen inches asunder, with
four wooden teeth in each. A second has three
<PB REF="41"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="16" REF="42"/>
bulls and twelve wooden teeth. A third has four
bulls, and twenty teeth, of wood or iron, ten, e∣leven,
or twelve inches asunder. Now, in fine
mould the last may be sufficient for covering the
seed; but none of them are sufficient to prepare
for the seed any ground that requires subduing.
The only tolerable form is that with iron teeth;
and the bare description of its imperfections, will
shew the necessity of a more perfect form. In
the first place, this harrow is by far too light for
ground new taken up from the state of nature,
for clays hardened with spring-drought, or for o∣ther
stubborn soils: it floats on the surface, and
after frequent returns in the same track, nothing
is done effectually. In the next place, the teeth
are too thick set, by which the harrow is apt to
be choked, especially where the earth is bound
with roots, which is commonly the case. At the
same time, the lightness and number of teeth keep
the harrow upon the surface, and prevent one of
its capital purposes, that of dividing the soil. Nor
will fewer teeth answer for covering the seed pro∣perly.
In the third place, the teeth are too short
for reducing a coarse soil to proper tilth; and yet
it would be in vain to make them longer, because
the harrow is too light for going deep into the
ground. Further, the common harrows are so
ill constructed, as to ride at every turn one upon
another. Much time is lost in disengaging them.
What pity is it, that an industrious farmer should
<PB N="17" REF="43"/>
be reduced to such an imperfect instrument, which
is neither fit to prepare the ground for seed, nor
to cover it properly. And I now add, that it is
equally unfit for extirpating weeds. The ground
is frequently so bound with couch-grass, as to
make the furrow-slice stand upright, as when old
lea is ploughed: notwithstanding much labour,
the grass-roots keep the field, and gain the victory.
What follows? The farmer at last is reduced to
the necessity of leaving the weeds in peaceable
possession, because his field will no longer bear
corn.</P>
<P>A little reflection, even without experience,
will make it evident, that the same harrows, what∣ever
be the form, can never answer all the differ∣ent
purposes of harrowing, nor can operate equal∣ly
in all different soils, rough or smooth, firm or
loose. Looking back not many years above thir∣ty,
no farmer in Scotland had the slightest notion
of different ploughs for different purposes. The
Scotch plough was the only one known. Differ∣ent
ploughs are now introduced; and it is full
time to think of different harrows. Rejecting the
common harrows, as in every respect badly con∣structed,
I boldly recommend the following. I use
three of them of different forms, for different pur∣poses.
They are all of the same weight, drawn
each by two horses. Birch is the best wood for
them, because it is cheap, and not apt to split.
The first is composed of four bulls, each four
<PB N="18" REF="44"/>
feet ten inches long, three and a quarter inches
broad, and three and a half deep; the interval
between the bulls eleven and three fourths inches;
so that the breadth of the whole harrow is four
feet. The bulls are connected by four sheths,
which go through each bull, and are fixed by tim∣ber
nails driven through both. In each bull five
teeth are inserted, ten inches free under the bull,
and ten inches asunder. They are of the same
form with those of the brake, and inserted into
the wood in the same manner. Each of these
teeth is three pounds weight: and where the har∣row
is made of birch, the weight of the whole is
six stone fourteen pounds Dutch. An erect bridle
is fixed at a corner of the harrow, three inches
high, with four notches for drawing higher or
lower. To this bridle a double tree is fixed for
two horses drawing abreast, as in a plough. And
to strengthen the harrow, a flat rod of iron is
nailed upon the harrow from corner to corner in
the line of the draught.</P>
<P>The second harrow consists of two parts, con∣nected
together by a crank or hinge in the mid∣dle,
and two chains of equal length, one at each
end, which keep the two parts always parallel,
and at the same distance from each other. The
crank is so contrived, as to allow the two parts to
ply to the ground like two unconnected harrows;
but neither of them to rise above the other, more
than if they were a single harrow without a joint.
<PB N="19" REF="45"/>
In a word, they may form an angle downward.
but not upward. Thus they have the effect of
two harrows in curved ground, and of one
weighty harrow in a plain. This harrow is com∣posed
of six bulls, each four feet long, three
inches broad, and three and a half deep. The
interval between the bulls nine and a half inches;
which makes the breadth of the whole harrow,
including the length of the crank, to be five feet
five inches. Each bull has five teeth, nine inches
free under the wood, and ten inches asunder.
The weight of each tooth is two pounds; the rest
as in the former.</P>
<P>The third consists also of two parts, connected
together like that last mentioned. It has eight
bulls, each four feet long, two and a half inches
broad, and three deep. The interval between the
bulls is eight inches: and the breadth of the whole
harrow, including the length of the crank, is six
feet four inches. In each bull are inserted five
teeth, seven inches free under the wood, and ten
and a half inches asunder, each tooth weighing
one pound. The rest as in the two former har∣rows.
The figure of each is annexed.</P>
<P>These harrows I hold to be a considerable im∣provement.
They ply to curved ground like two
unconnected harrows, and when drawn in one
plain, they are in effect one harrow of double
weight, which makes the teeth pierce deep into
the ground. The imperfection of common har∣rows,
<PB N="20" REF="46"/>
mentioned above, will suggest the advanta∣ges
of the set of harrows here recommended.
The first is proper for harrowing land that has lain
long after ploughing, as where oats are sown on
a winter-furrow, and in general for harrowing
stiff land: it pierces deep into the soil by its long
teeth, and divides it minutely. The second is in∣tended
for covering the seed: its long teeth lays
the seed deeper than the common harrow can do;
which is no slight advantage By placing the seed
considerably under the surface, the young plants
are, on the one hand, protected from too much
heat, and, on the other, have sufficiency of moi∣sture.
At the same time, the seed is so well co∣vered
that none of it is lost. Seed slightly cover∣ed
by the common harrows, wants moisture, and
is burnt up by the sun; beside, that a proportion
of it is left upon the surface uncovered. The
third harrow supplies what may be deficient in the
second, by smoothing the surface, and covering
the seed more accurately. The three harrows
make the ground finer and finer, as heckles do
lint; or, to use a different comparison, the first
harrow makes the bed, the second lays the seed
in it, the third smooths the cloaths. These ad∣vantages
are certain. If any man doubt, let him
try the experiment, and he will find the effect of
them in his crops. I can say so with assurance
from the experience of many years. They have
another advantage not inferior to any mentioned;
<PB N="21" REF="47"/>
they mix manure with the soil more intimately
than can be done by common harrows; and up∣on
such intimate mixture depends greatly the ef∣fect
of manure, as shall be explained afterward.
To conclude, these harrows are contrived to an∣swer
an established principle in agriculture, That
fertility depends greatly on pulverizing the soil,
and on an intimate mixture of manure with it,
whether dung, lime, marl, or any other.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>4. The ROLLER.</HEAD>
<P>THE roller is an instrument of capital use in
husbandry, though scarcely known in ordinary
practice; and, where introduced, it is commonly
so slight as to have very little effect.</P>
<P>Rollers are of different kinds, stone, yetling,
wood. Each of these has its advantages. I re∣commend
the last, constructed in the following
manner. Take the body of a tree, six feet ten
inches long, the larger the better, made as near
a perfect cylinder as possible. Surround this cy∣linder
with three rows of fillies, one row in the
middle, and one at each end. Line these fillies
with planks of wood equally long with the roller,
and so narrow as to ply into a circle. Bind them
fast together with iron rings. Beech wood is the
best, being hard and tough. The roller thus
mounted, ought to have a diameter of three feet
ten inches. It has a double pair of shafts for two
<PB N="22" REF="48"/>
horses abreast. These are sufficient in level
ground: in ground not level, four horses may be
necessary. The roller without the shafts ought to
weigh two hundred stone Dutch; and the large
diameter makes this great weight easy to be
drawn.</P>
<P>With respect to the season for rolling. Rolling
wheat in the month of April, is an important ar∣ticle
in loose soil; as the winter-rains pressing
down the soil leave many roots in the air. Bar∣ley
ought to be rolled immediately after the seed
is sown; especially where grass-seeds are sown
with it. The best time for rolling a gravelly soil,
is as soon as the mould is so dry as to bear the
roller without clinging to it. A clay soil ought
neither to be tilled, harrowed, nor rolled, till the
field be perfectly dry. And as rolling a clay soil
is chiefly intended for smoothing the surface, a
dry season may be patiently waited for, even till
the crop be three inches high. There is the
greater reason for this precaution, because much
rain immediately after rolling is apt to cake the
surface when drought follows. Oats in a light
soil may be rolled immediately after the seed is
sown, unless the ground be so wet as to cling to
the roller. In a clay soil, delay rolling till the
grain be above ground. The proper time for
sowing grass-seeds in an oat-field, is when the
grain is three inches high; and rolling should im∣mediately
succeed whatever the soil be. Flax
<PB N="23" REF="49"/>
ought to be rolled immediately after sowing.
This should never be neglected; for it makes the
seed push equally, and prevents after growth, the
bad effect of which is visible in every step of the
process for dressing flax. The first year's crop of
sown grasses ought to be rolled as early the next
spring as the ground will bear the horses. It fixes
all the roots precisely as in the case of wheat.
Rolling the second and third crops in loose soil, is
an useful work; though not so essential as rolling
the first crop.</P>
<P>The effects of rolling properly used, are sub∣stantial.
In the first place, it renders a loose soil
more compact and solid; which encourages the
growth of plants, by making the earth clap close
to every part of every root. Nor need we be a∣fraid
of rendering the soil too compact; for no
roller that can be drawn by two or four horses
will have that effect. In the next place, rolling
keeps in the moisture, and hinders drought to
penetrate. This effect is of great moment. In a
dry season, it may make the difference of a good
crop, or no crop, especially where the soil is light.
In the third place, the rolling grass-seeds, beside
the foregoing advantages, facilitates the mowing
for hay. And it is to be hoped, that the advan∣tage
of this practice will lead farmers to mow
their corn also, which will encrease the quantity
of straw, both for food and for the dunghill.</P>
<P>There is a small roller for breaking clods in
<PB N="24" REF="50"/>
land intended for barley. The common way is,
to break clods with a mell, which requires many
hands, and is a laborious work. This roller per∣forms
the work more effectually, and at much
less expence: let a harrowing precede, which
will break the clods a little; and after lying a
day or a day and half to dry, this roller will
dissolve them into powder. This however does
not supersede the use of the great roller after all
the other articles are finished, in order to make
the soil compact, and to keep out the summer∣drought.
A stone roller four feet long, and fif∣teen
inches diameter, drawn by one horse, is suf∣ficient
to break clods that are easily dissolved by
pressure. The use of this roller in preparing
ground for barley is gaining ground daily, even
among ordinary tenants, who have become sen∣sible
both of the expence and toil of using wooden
mells. But in a clay soil, the clods are some∣times
too firm, or too tough, to be subdued by so
light a machine. In that case, a roller of the same
size, but of a different construction, is necessary.
It ought to be surrounded with circles of iron, six
inches asunder, and seven inches deep; which
will cut even the most stubborn clods, and reduce
them to powder. Let not this instrument be con∣sidered
as a finical refinement. In a stiff clay, it
may make the difference of a plentiful or scanty
crop.</P>

<HEAD>5. The FANNER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS instrument for winnowing corn was in∣troduced
into Scotland not many years ago. For∣merly
wind being our only resource, the winnow∣ing
of corn was no less precarious than the grind∣ing
it at a windmill: people often were redu∣ced
to famine in the midst of plenty. There was
another bad effect: it was necessary to place a
barn open to the west wind, however irregular or
inconvenient the situation might be with regard to
the other buildings. But it is needless to be par∣ticular
upon that useful instrument; because every
farmer considers it now as no less essential than a
plough or a harrow.</P>
</DIV4>

<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">FARM CATTLE and CARRIAGES.</HEAD>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>1. FARM-HORSES.</HEAD>
<P>A HORSE fit for a waggon, cart, or plough,
ought to be strong, compact, and about
fifteen hands high. A carter or a ploughman
cannot perform the same work with horses of less
size; by which there is a considerable loss, as
he is paid by the year, not by the quantity of
<PB N="26" REF="52"/>
work he performs. Great attention ought to be
given to the breaking a farm-horse: good educa∣tion
will make him tractable, and obedient to the
voice, without necessity of applying the whip: the
former makes the whole team move at once; the
latter moves the horse only that feels it.</P>
<P>We stop a little to consider the disadvantage of
small and ill-fed horses, common in Scotland. Two
stout horses in a plough will make as deep a fur∣row
as four of what are commonly used; and yet
the former are less expensive both in price and
maintenance. A gentleman cannot do better for
his own interest, than to promote a good breed of
farm-horses: two good horses will be a saving of
L. 8 Sterling yearly, that is expended by using
four weak horses. I shall mention only the car∣riage
of lime. One servant fills his cart with a
hundred stone, which two good horses can pull
with ease. Another lays but the half upon his
cart, because his two weak horses are able for no
more. This is a double loss to the master: he
gets less work, not from the horses only, but also
from the servant.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>2. FARM-OXEN.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is not in agriculture any other improve∣ment
that equals the using oxen instead of horses:
they are equally tractable; and they are purcha∣sed
and maintained at much less expence. As
<PB N="27" REF="53"/>
this improvement is obvious to the meanest capa∣city,
one might expect to see every farmer gree∣dily
embracing it, as he would a feast after being
famished. Yet few stir. How is this to be ac∣counted
for? Men are led by custom in chains;
and in instances without number are fettered a∣gainst
their interest. “And why should we pre∣tend
to be wiser than our fathers?” they will say
modestly, or rather obstinately.</P>
<P>What warms me upon this subject, is the great
consumption of oats by work-horses, which would
be totally saved by using oxen only. Did our
own product furnish this consumption, it were less
to be regretted; but it is grievous to be reduced
to the necessity of importing annually vast quanti∣ties
of oats; all of which would be saved by em∣ploying
oxen only in a farm. Nor is this all that
would be saved, as shall be mentioned by and by.</P>
<P>But that I may not be accused of declaiming
without foundation, I am willing to enter into a
candid comparison between horses and oxen as
employ'd in a farm. I begin with affirming, that
an ox is as tractable as a horse, and as easily
trained to a plough or a cart. I have seen a
couple of them in a plough going as sweetly with∣out
a driver as a couple of horses; directed by
the voice alone without a rein. Oxen beside are
preferable for a steady draught, as they always
pull to their strength, without ever flinching:
horses, on the contrary, are apt to stop when they
<PB N="28" REF="54"/>
meet with unexpected resistance. As oxen have
less air and spirit in moving than horses, their mo∣tion
is concluded to be slower. They are less ex∣peditious,
it is true, in galloping, or perhaps in
trotting; but as farm-work is performed by step∣ping,
let the step of a horse and of an ox be com∣pared,
and the latter will be found not inferior,
especially where an ox is harnessed like a horse.
Colonel Pool in Derbyshire ploughs as much
ground with three oxen, as the neighbouring
farmers do with four or five horses. In summer
they eat nothing but grass: in winter, they have
hay or turnip when much wrought; straw only
when wrought moderately. About Bawtry, in
Yorkshire, four oxen in a plough do as much
work as the same number of good horses. In se∣veral
places of Kent, an acre daily is ploughed
with a team of oxen, sometimes a quarter more.
Near Beaconsfield, Mr Burke ploughs an acre in
a day with four oxen; and his neighbours do no
more with four horses.</P>
<P>Hitherto the comparison holds pretty equal.
In one article oxen are clearly preferable. Their
dung makes excellent manure; and by that means
they always improve the pasture. Horse-dung,
on the contrary, burns where it falls, and hurts
the pasture. Horse-dung from the stable ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a
greater tendency to burn than to rot; and to
make it useful, it requires to be carefully mixed
with cooler materials.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="55"/>
But the chief advantage of oxen comes under
the article of savings, which branch out into
many particulars. In the first place, the price of
a horse fit for labour doubles that of an ox. An
ox worth seven pounds, will perform as much so∣lid
work as a horse worth fourteen. This is an
important article: the labouring cattle are the
most expensive part of a farm-stock; and it is
that expence which keeps back from farming,
many men whose skill and industry would afford
them a comfortable living. In that view, it is
greatly the interest of landlords to promote oxen,
as they tend to multiply candidates for a farm;
which not only gives the landlord opportunity for
a proper ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e, but will raise every farm to its
just value.</P>
<P>As an ox is cheaper than a horse, so he is fed
cheaper in proportion. He requires no corn, and he
works to perfection upon cut grass in summer, and
upon hay in winter. He does well even upon oat∣straw.
Thus by using oxen, a farmer can make mo∣ney
of his whole crop of oats, except what is neces∣sary
for maintenance of his family. The bulk of
that product, on the contrary, is consumed by
farm-horses. Even in the carse of Gowry, the
consumption of oats on farm-horses is so great, that
at Perth and Dundee there are annually imported
between four and five thousand bolls of oat-meal.</P>
<P>A horse is liable to many diseases that an ox is
free from. If he happen to turn lame, to which
<PB N="30" REF="56"/>
he is subjected from many accidents, he is render∣ed
useless. An ox can always be turned to ac∣count;
for if disabled from work, he can be fat∣ted
for the shambles, and can be sold for more
than was paid for him.</P>
<P>A horse commonly turns useless for work in ten
years, and the stock of horses must be renewed every
ten years at a medium, which is a deep article of
expence to the farmer. Oxen last for ever; or,
which comes to the same, they can be sold to the
butcher when past the vigour of work, and their
price will be more than sufficient to put young
oxen in their stead.</P>
<P>Horses require more attendance than oxen:
they must be curried, combed, and rubbed down.
Let oxen have their proper quantity of food, and
they require no other care. It is sufficient em∣ployment
for a man to manage four or five
horses: he will manage with equal ease double
the number of oxen.</P>
<P>The shoeing of horses is no inconsiderable ar∣ticle.
The expence of shoeing oxen is a mere
trifle.</P>
<P>These several articles of saving are summed up
in a following table, and are very considerable.
This sum ought to go wholly to the landlord as
additional rent. The tenant has no claim for any
share; because after paying that additional rent,
he has as much profit as he had formerly when
he wrought with horses.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="57"/>
By this mode of husbandry, the advantage to
the landlord is great; and to the kingdom much
greater, by saving the importation of an immense
quantity of oats. But the advantage of oxen is
still more extensive: it reaches every manufactu∣rer,
and indeed the whole people. There must
be a great increase of oxen to answer the pur∣poses
of farming: every one of these, after their
prime is over, goes to the shambles: the markets
are filled with beef, which not only lowers the price
of beef, but of leather and tallow. The savings up∣on
these articles would bring down the wages of
our manufacturers, and consequently the price of
our manufactures in a foreign market; not to
mention that cheap manufactures at home tend
also to lower wages.</P>
<P>People differ in the manner of yoking oxen.
In some places they are yoked by the tip of the
horn; in some by the root. These modes are
visibly inconvenient. When an ox draws by the
shoulder like a horse, his head is free, and his
motion natural. When yoked by the horns, he
lowers his head to the line of the draught: his
posture is constrained, and his step short. His
neck indeed is strong, but his shoulder is a better
<HI>fulcrum</HI> for the draught. To yoke an ox by the
shoulder, his harness ought to be the same with
that of a horse. The only difference is, that as
his horns hinder the collar from being slipped o∣ver
<PB N="32" REF="58"/>
his head, it must be open below, and buckled
after it is on.</P>
<P>When the advantages of oxen for draught
are so great, it cannot but appear strange, that in
Britain oxen have almost totally been laid aside.
Among the ancients, we read of no beasts for
draught but oxen. It was so in Greece, as early
as the days of Hesiod; and it was so every where.
The Dutch at the Cape of Good Hope plough
with oxen, and exercise them early to a quick
pace, so as to equal horses in the waggon, as well
as in the plough. They are used in the East In∣dies
for carrying burdens; and they are fitter
even than horses for that service, the back of an
ox being convex, and consequently more able to
support a weight than that of a horse. All that
is necessary in the furniture for the back, is a bit
of wood or stiff leather, to prevent the load from
falling down upon the neck. The only cause I
can assign for preferring horses, are bad roads,
which were universal in Britain till lately. Being
impracticable for carts during winter, the farmer
carried his corn to market on horseback. A pro∣per
furniture for the back of an ox was not
thought of, though an easy inven<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion. And
horses being thought necessary for carrying bur∣dens,
they were employed instead of oxen in e∣very
work: if employed at all, they are too ex∣pensive
ever to be suffered to be idle. Another
circumstance contributed. Because oxen require
<PB N="33" REF="59"/>
no corn, it is commonly imagined that they scarce
require any food. They are put off during win∣ter
with a bottle of dry straw, which after the
turn of the year affords very little nourishment.
They become too weak for working; and yet,
instead of bettering their food, it is vainly thought
that multiplying their number in a plough will
answer; and thus may be seen in several places
yoked in a plough, ten or twelve weak animals
that can scarce support their own weight. We
are now provided with good roads every where;
and there is no longer the pretext of bad roads
for preferring horses. Corn is now carried to
market in carts, for which oxen are no less pro∣per
than horses. And it is hoped, that farmers
will at last break through a bad custom, and
open their eyes to their own interest. Nothing is
more deeply their interest than to lay aside hor∣ses
totally in farm-operations, and to employ
oxen. The tacksman profits first; but does not
the landlord gain more, by enabling his tenants
in new leases to pay a higher rent? Why then
should gentlemen loiter, while they can so easily
advance their rent without oppressing their te∣nants?
Why do they not encourage their te∣nants
by example and precept, to follow a mode
that is equally beneficial to themselves and to their
country? It will be hard indeed, if a single te∣nant
cannot be found to see his interest: if a
landlord can prevail but upon one or two of his
<PB N="34" REF="60"/>
tenants to take the lead, the rest will naturally
follow. At any rate, he can force them to their
own good, by prohibiting horses in every new
lease. It is a strange sort of ambition that moves
gentlemen to spend their estates in the House of
Commons, where most of them are mere mutes,
instead of serving their country and themselves at
home, which is genuine patriotism.</P>
<P>As computation is the touchstone of profit and
loss, two computations are subjoined; one to satisfy
the farmer of the sum he will save by employing
oxen instead of horses; and one to shew what be∣nefit
will accrue to the public by the change. To set
the first computation in a clear light, and to avoid
fractions, I make the supposition, that a horse put
to work at the age of five may endure hard work
for twelve years, which is a large allowance beyond
the truth. An ox is put to work at the age of four,
and at seven is in his prime, which is the proper
time to feed for the shambles. The computation
accordingly is framed upon a revolution of twelve
years; during which period oxen are four times
changed without any change of horses. At the
end of the period, both must be changed; and
a new revolution goes on as before.</P>

By this table it appears, that the yearly expence
of a farm-horse exceeds that of an ox an less than
L. 6 : 3 : 8. Now supposing four horses neces∣sary
to a farm of 100 acres, rent L. 50 yearly,
four good oxen well fed will perform the same
work; and therefore the using the latter instead
of the former will be an annual saving of L. 24,
14 s. 8 d. very near the half of the rent. And
what will raise it above half of the rent, is the in∣terest
of the money laid out, which is consider∣ably
higher upon the horse than upon the ox; but
which is omitted in the foregoing table, to avoid
an intricate calculation.</P>
<P>There is beside an article that preponderates
geatly for the ox. His dung enriches the ground
on which he pastures. Horse-dung, on the con∣trary,
is hurtful. This is an article of great im∣portance.</P>
<P>N. B. The hay or straw consumed by the horse
in winter is not less than that consumed by the ox;
and therefore that article is left out with respect
to both.</P>
<Q>Computation of the yearly quantity of oats con∣sumed
in Scotland by labouring horses.</Q>
<P>FOR repairing the highways in East Lothian,
each ploughgate of land is rated at a certain
sum; and there are in the county computed to be
1331 ploughgates. In every plough four horses
<PB N="38" REF="64"/>
are employed; and many farmers employ addi∣tional
horses for harrowing, &amp;c.; but supposing
only four, the number of farm-horses will be
5324. According to the preceding table, the yearly
quantity of corn consumed by a horse is 5 bolls
2 pecks; consequently the amount of the corn
consumed annually is 27,285 <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>/2 bolls; which, com∣puted
at 12 s. a-boll, a moderate price, amounts
to the sum of L. 16,371, 6 s. Sterling.</P>
<P>Reckoning the horses employed in all the other
corn-countries in Scotland, their number will be
at least fifteen times as many as what are employed
in East Lothian. Therefore, to find out the va∣lue
of the oats consumed in Scotland by work∣horses,
multiply the said sum of L. 16,371, 6 s.
Sterling by 16, which is L. 261,940, 16 s.; an
immense sum that would be saved to this nation
by employing oxen in agriculture instead of
horses.</P>
<P>If I cannot prevail upon farmers to mind their
own interest by employing oxen instead of horses,
I shall at least make them blush, by comparing
them with farmers no less obstinate in another
particular. A farmer was brought from Norfolk
to the neighbourhood of Axminster, who being
disgusted at the husbandry practised there, com∣menced
a better plan. His first attempt was, to
make turnip a regular crop in rotation, and to
hoe them twice in the Norfolk manner. He met
with many obstructions from perverseness and auk∣wardness
<PB N="39" REF="65"/>
of his servants; but by perseverance,
and working with them himself, he has prevailed.
He now for many years has had exceeding good
crops; which at the same time have improved
the succeeding crops of barley. Of these facts his
neighbours have been witnesses near twenty years;
and yet not one of them has followed his example.
Can there be a stronger instance of prejudice, or
rather stupidity?</P>

<HEAD>4. WHEEL-CARRIAGES.</HEAD>
<P>WHEEL-CARRIAGES for a farm are, waggons
drawn by four horses; carts by one, two, or three
horses; coups with oxen and horses; and three-wheeled
carts with one horse. Till lately no
farm-carriages were known in Scotland, but upon
horse-back; and in many places there are no o∣ther
carriages.</P>
<P>Whatever strength a horse may have, yet the
weight he can draw is determined by his own
weight: in drawing, there is a certain weight
that he cannot exceed without being raised off
the ground; and therefore, to enable him to
exert his whole strength, some weight ought to
be laid on his back. Nothing is more common
than to see a carter mount the tram-horse, when
hard strained in drawing up-hill. He imagines
that he has the horse more under command; but
the true reason is, that the horse draws more by
having weight on his back. In the ordinary way
of yoking two horses in a line, the tram-horse,
who is burdened with part of the weight of the
cart, draws much more than the horse before can
do. In that view, a cart with double trams, for
yoking two horses abreast, must be an improve∣ment;
because a certain weight may be laid on
the back of each, so as to enable them on occa∣sion
to exert their utmost strength.</P>
<P>I have taken some pains to know what can be
<PB N="42" REF="68"/>
drawn in a cart without straining the horses; but
I find no uniformity. Two horses in a cart, yo∣ked
in a line, usually draw, from Borrowstoun∣ness
to Glasgow, three thousand weight. From
Stirling to Glasgow they draw but twenty-four
hundred weight. Alexander Monteith, a carter
in the neighbourhood of Carron, has, with two
horses, repeatedly drawn from Banton, in the
parish of Kilsyth, to Carron, four thousand four
hundred weight, each hundred weight consisting
of one hundred and twenty pounds Avoirdupois.
He commonly draws thirty-seven or thirty-eight
hundred weight. The carts between Borrow∣stounness
and Glasgow carry from ten to fifteen
hundred weight with a single horse. And with the
same draught they carry about Edinburgh twelve
hundred weight of coals. They carried formerly
no more but that weight with two horfes yoked
in a line. Mr Orr of Barrowfield, for carrying
his coals to market, uses single-horse carts with
wheels six feet high. Every cart carries easily
twenty-one hundred weight to the place of un∣loading,
which is distant from the coal-pit about
two English miles; and this is done six times e∣very
day. The inequality of these weights shows
the inaccuracy of carters who have not come to
any precise knowledge of what horses can perform
in a cart. In the mean time, till more exact ex∣periments
be made, we shall take a middle rate,
which is the three thousand weight drawn by two
horses from Borrowstounness to Glasgow, the half
<PB N="43" REF="69"/>
of which for a single horse is fifteen hundred
weight; though, considering the weight that lies
upon the back of a single horse in a cart, his part
of the draught may be well computed at sixteen
hundred weight.</P>
<P>This leads to a comparison between a waggon
and single-horse carts of the ordinary make. To
keep within bounds, we may fairly take it for
granted, that in a well-constructed cart, a single
horse of moderate seize will command fourteen
hundred weight; consequently that six horses in
six carts will draw eight thousand four hundred
weight. Let us now see what is drawn in a wag∣gon
with six horses. The ordinary weight in this
country are four tons, or eight thousand weight;
and I am informed it is the same about London. At
that rate, six horses in six ordinary carts, draw
four hundred weight more than six horses in a
waggon. At the same time, in a turnpike-road,
a man and a boy are sufficient to manage the for∣mer
as well as the latter.</P>
<P>But, to carry on the comparison, small carts
have another advantage, which is, that they ad∣mit
high wheels; and it is easy to adjust the
wheels to the height of the horse, by making the
axle go through the middle of the cart, or higher
if necessary, to make the horse draw horizontally.
It is a great case to the horse to make the axle go
through the centre of gravity; for by that means
the weight on the horse's back is the same going
<PB N="44" REF="70"/>
up-hill or down-hill. A waggon carrying four or
five tons, is incapable of that improvement; for
high wheels able to support such a weight, would
require a strength of timber that would be in∣tolerable,
especially in going up-hill. Here ap∣pears
in a conspicuous light the advantage of
single carts with high wheels above a waggon.
Upon Mr Orr's practice, I take it for granted,
that with wheels six feet high, a single horse will
carry easily twenty-one hundred weight for a
whole season. But let us state only two thou∣sand
weight, or a single ton, is not the con∣clusion
fair, that in such carts six horses will draw
a third more than in a waggon?</P>
<P>Thus, single-horse carts are clearly preferable
to a waggon with respect to the burden they can
carry; and they are still more preferable with re∣spect
to the highways. A turnpike-road would
be easily made, and more easily supported, were
none but single-horse carts admitted, or were the
toll doubled or tripled upon waggons. This spe∣culation
merits the most serious attention of the
legislature. To preserve turnpike-roads in per∣fect
order, a single act of parliament would be
sufficient. The Irish have taken the lead in this
important article. We ought to follow without
a moment's delay.</P>
<P>The proportion that ought to be laid on a
horse's shoulders to have the greatest command of
the draught, remains to be ascertained by experi∣ments.
<PB N="45" REF="71"/>
But I guess, that a horse who can draw
fourteen hundred weight without any load on his
back, will with equal case draw sixteen hundred,
by laying on his back five or six stone of that
weight.</P>
<P>A wheel-carriage is a great saving to the farm∣er,
much greater than in a cursory view will be
imagined. A cart with two horses carries five
bolls of shell-lime. I talk of ordinary carts with
two horses in a line; for two horses abreast in
trams will carry much more. The same quanitity
on horseback requires six horses. To the former
one man is sufficient; to the latter, one to every
two horses. Now, supposing a man and a cart with
two horses, to be hired for three shillings a-day,
which is less than ordinary, the expence of the
lime on horseback is nine shillings; in cart, no
more but three. Here is a saving of six shillings
upon every five bolls. And supposing forty-eight
cart-loads of lime to be led in a summer, which is
a moderate computation even in a farm that em∣ploys
but a single plough, the saving amounts to
L. 14, 8 s. which alone is sufficient to convert a
losing farm into a profitable one. I have been a
witness to the carrying on horseback 700 loads of
coals, a man to every two horses; the expence
of which amounts to L. 52, 10 s. supposing a
man to be hired at eight pence a-day, and a horse
at fourteen pence. That quantity can be carried
in carts with two horses for L. 21 : 2 : 11. The
<PB N="46" REF="72"/>
same calculation is applicable to grain. A cart
with two horses will carry to market six bolls of
barley, which, when carried on horseback, re∣quire
six horses. A single plough in tolerable soil
well cultivated, will afford for sale a hundred bolls
of grain, which carried in carts makes a saving of
L. 4 Sterling.</P>
<P>The use of a three-wheeled cart drawn by a
single horse, is to remove earth, or to carry ma∣nure
to a near field. One horse serves two of
these carts: when he returns after unloading, the
other is ready filled. But this work is so severe
for a single horse, that the field ought to be
smooth and level; or inclining downward, which
is still better.</P>
<P>I shall only add upon this head, that the sacks
commonly used in Scotland for corn, are too
heavy. In England small sacks are used, which
one man can easily load or unload.</P>

<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">FARM-OFFICES.</HEAD>
<P>IN this country there are few traces of skill or
contrivance in farm-houses; no regard to a
centric situation, nor to a dry spot, nor to ven∣tilation.
Our farm-offices are set down straggling
and confused as if by accident; here a barn,
there a stable. Imperfection in form is more ex∣cusable,
<PB N="47" REF="73"/>
there being few good examples to copy
from: every where to be seen cow-houses so auk∣wardly
formed, as that in order to clean them
the cattle must be turned to the door; and so
strait that they must dung upon each other. And
lastly, after all the labours of the year, no place
contrived for keeping corns dry.</P>
<P>Though to a stack-yard dryness of situation and
free ventilation are essential; yet so little are these
circumstances regarded, that a stack-yard is al∣ways
adjacent to the dwelling-house, whether the
spot be wet or dry. It is at the same time care∣fully
surrounded with trees, as if to prevent ven∣tilation,
and as if water dropping from the
branches on the corn-stacks were salutary to
them.</P>
<P>A kitchen-garden is of importance to a farm,
as will appear afterward. There is indeed always
a kitchen-garden, but very little attended to. The
chief attention is to surround it with trees; and
yet the necessary effect of excluding free air, is to
dwarf the plants, and to give them a bad taste.</P>
<P>It seems to be the opinion of our farmers, that
a dunghill cannot be too moist; for it is com∣monly
put in a hole, and consequently surrounded
with water: the richest parts are imbibed by the
water, and both evaporate together, leaving the
dunghill little better than a <HI>caput mortuum.</HI> Wa∣ter
at the same time, in any quantity, is far from
contributing to putrefaction. I have seen a sheaf
<PB N="48" REF="74"/>
of straw, after lying six months in water, so tough
as to be fit for making ropes.</P>
<P>The foregoing defects are but imperfectly re∣medied
in the latest constructions. The form
most in request is three sides of a square; the hou∣ses
for the farm-cattle on the east, the barn on the
west, and sheds on the north, the dunghill occu∣pying
the middle of the square. The stables are
too far from the barn; the dung lies scattered, and
trodden upon by the cattle; and the expence of
roofing is great.</P>
<P>These particulars are mentioned as an intro∣duction
to the following plan; preferable upon two
accounts; first, as less expensive; and next, as
more convenient. The plan is, to erect a house of
two stories, the under story for a stable, and the
upper for a barn. The door of the stable fronts
the east; that of the barn the west, having a stair
that leads up to it. The stack-yard joins the
barn, with free air to the north, west, and south.
Round this building are sheds for cattle laid to
the walls, with roofs sloping from the easing.
The sheds should be twelve feet wide, sufficient
for the size of any farm-beast; and the outward
wall may be seven feet high or so. There is
place for six sheds, one on each gable, and two
on each side-wall, leaving an interval for the
doors of the barn and stable.</P>
<P>There will be found a great saving in this plan,
compared with the other mentioned. To form a
<PB N="49" REF="75"/>
just comparison, they ought to be equally capa∣cious;
the two barns ought to be of the same
size, and there ought to be room for the same
number of cattle. The expence of each is an∣nexed;
and the saving on the plan recommended
is no less than L. 94 : 2 : 2 Sterling. This is an
important article to every gentleman who possesses
an estate in a corn-country; for no article is hea∣vier
than the building farm-houses. Next as to
convenience. In the ordinary form, where the
barn is on one side of a court, and the stables on
the opposite side, the time consumed in carrying
straw to the cattle is almost entirely saved in the
plan proposed; there being holes in the barn-floor
over every stall, covered with a moveable board,
through which straw is let down to the cattle;
and this leaves nothing to the ploughman or cart∣er,
but to attend to the working of his cattle. In
general, such work ought to be avoided that must
be left to the discretion of servants to carry on
fast or slow, without any effectual check. With
respect to threshing, a timber-floor has great e∣lasticity;
and I am made certain from experience,
that a third part more may be threshed on it than
on an earthen floor, which has no elasticity. At
the same time, the frequent sweeping of an earth∣floor
raises the finer parts of the earth, which mix
with the grain: this is totally prevented in clean∣ing
corn upon a timber-floor. Further, the damp∣ness
of an earthen floor corrupts the grain; it can∣not
<PB N="50" REF="76"/>
be kept a fortnight from vegetating, especially if
laid up to the damp wall. Sacks give no security;
for they rot if allowed to stand in the barn any
time. A barn in a second floor is excellent for
preventing all these evils: one end contains a
stack of corn, the middle is for threshing, and the
other end for cleaning the corn when threshed.
Above this end there is a loft for holding the
cleaned corn, to which there is easy access by a
stair; and here corn may be kept in fafety for
months.</P>
<P>It will be objected against this plan, that there
is no court for a dunghill, where winterers are
commonly fed. But this I have purposely avoid∣ed;
for it will be seen afterwards, in the instruc∣tions
given for the feeding of cattle, that to keep
winterers in that manner is hurtful both to them
and to the dunghill. They will be more com∣fortably
put up in sheds; provided only in build∣ing
care be taken to give a free circulation of air.</P>
<P>One article still remains, in treating of farm∣offices,
which is a house for laying up instruments
of husbandry, when not employed. Few farmers
are sufficiently careful about this articles: they be∣have
as if instruments of husbandry could be pro∣cured
without pains, and without price. It is true
indeed, that these instruments are generally so mean
and so insufficient as to deserve very little care;—nothing
more common, than to be left where last
used, open to heat and cold, drought and moisture.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="77"/>
To form a just notion of the properest method
for preserving wood, I must premise, that it will
last equally well in air and in water; but it must
be kept constantly in the one or the other. What
destroys wood is the alternate action of air and
water. Observe a stake driven into the ground:
the part that consumes first, is not that within the
ground, nor that freely out of it, but the ring at
the surface of the ground, to which air and moi∣sture
have equal access. The same where one piece
of wood is mortised into another: the part that
decays first, is where the two pieces join, which is
open to the air, and at the same time lodges moi∣sture.
The same is observeable in the putrefaction
of a dunghill: the parts from which either air or
water is excluded, never rot. I must premise in
the next place, that though in a mortise the parts
joined rot the soonest, yet the mortifed part, from
which both air and water are excluded, decays
sooner than that which is open to the air, suppo∣sing
it to be kept dry.</P>
<P>Hence it follows, that to preserve wood in the
most perfect manner, it ought to be sheltered from
rain, and exposed as much as possible to the ven∣tilation
of dry air. This suggests the best con∣struction
of a house for preserving instruments of
husbandry. It ought to be erected in the highest
spot, free to every wind: it ought to have a roof
supported on pillars; the sides ought to be con∣structed
like those of a drying-house at a bleach∣field,
<PB N="52" REF="78"/>
with moveable boards for admitting air and
excluding rain. Three feet or so may be left open
at bottom; because so low down no rain can pe∣netrate
to do mischief. Need I add, that before
laying up any instrument, it ought to be carefully
cleaned and dried?</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>1. OBSTRUCTIONS to CROPPING.</HEAD>
<P>IN preparing land for cropping, the first thing
that occurs to the writer and to the husband∣man,
is to consider the obstructions to regular
<PB N="54" REF="80"/>
ploughing. The most formidable of these, are
stones lying above or below the surface, which are
an impediment to a plough, as rocks are to a ship.
Did not custom account for it, how strange would
it appear, that few proprietors or tenants in Scot∣land
think of clearing their land of stones. Stones
above the surface may be avoided by the plough∣man,
though not without loss of ground; but
stones below the surface are commonly not disco∣vered
till the plough be shattered to pieces, and
perhaps a day's work lost. The clearing land of
stones is therefore necessary to prevent mischief.
And to encourage the operation, it is attended with
much actual profit. Take the following particu∣lars.
The stones are useful for fences: when
large they must be blown, and commonly fall into
parts proper for building. And as the blowing,
when gunpowder is furnished, does not exceed
a halfpenny for each inch that is bored, these
stones come generally cheaper than to dig as
many out of the quarry. In the next place, as
the soil round a large stone is commonly the best
in the field, it is purchased at a low rate by ta∣king
out the stone. Nor is this a trifle; for not
only is the ground lost that is occupied by a large
stone, but also a considerable space round it, to
which the plough has not access without danger.
A third advantage is greater than all the rest;
which is, that the ploughing can be carried on
with much expedition, when there is no appre∣hension
<PB N="55" REF="81"/>
of stones: in stony land, the plough must
proceed so slow, as not to perform half of its
work.</P>
<P>To clear land of stones, is in many instances
an undertaking too expensive for a tenant who has
not a very long lease. As it is profitable both to
him and to his landlord, it appears reasonable
that the work should be divided, where the lease
exceeds not nineteen years. It falls naturally up∣on
the landlord to be at the expence of blowing
the stones, and upon the tenant to carry them off
the field.</P>
<P>It is vain to think of drawing any considerable
rent, till a farm be cleared of stones. Why
then do gentlemen neglect this means of impro∣ving
their land? In a lease, let it be a proviso,
that the landlord or his steward be advertised of
every stone that obstructs the plough. When a
number of these are marked, let an artist be em∣ployed
to bore and to blow; and the landlord has
done his part. I engage that he will make twenty
<HI>per cent.</HI> of the money laid out in this operation.</P>
<P>Another obstruction is wet ground. Water is
a good servant, but a bad master. It may improve
gravelly or sandy soils; but it sours a clay soil,
and converts low ground into a morass, unfit for
any purpose that can interest the husbandman.</P>
<P>A great deal has been written upon different
methods of draining land, mostly so expensive as
<PB N="56" REF="82"/>
to be scarce fit for the landlord, not to mention
the tenant.</P>
<P>One way of draining without expence when
land is to be enclosed with hedge and ditch, is to
direct the ditches so as to carry off the water. But
this method is not always practicable, even where
the divisions lie convenient for it. If the run of
water be considerable, it will destroy the ditches,
and lay open the fences, especially where the soil
is loose or sandy.</P>
<P>If ditches will not answer, hollow drains are
sometimes made, and sometimes open drains,
which must be made so deep as to command the
water. The former is filled up with loose stones,
with brush-wood, or with any other porous mat∣ter
that permits the water to pass. The latter is
left open, and not filled up. To make the former
effectual, the ground must have such a slope as to
give the water a brisk course. To execute them
in level ground in a gross error: the passages are
soon stopped up with sand and sediment, and the
work rendered useless. This inconvenience takes
not place in open drains: but they are subject to
other inconveniencies: They are always filling
up, to make a yearly reparation necessary; and
they obstruct both ploughing and pasturing.</P>
<P>I venture to recommend the following drain as
the best in all views. It is an open drain made
with the plough, cleaving the space intended for
the drain over and over, till the furrow be made
<PB N="57" REF="83"/>
of a sufficient depth for carrying off the water.
The slope on either side may by repeated plough∣ings
be made so gentle as to give no obstruction
either to the plough or to the harrow. There is
no occasion for a spade, unless to smooth the sides
of the drain, and to remove accidental obstruc∣tions
in the bottom. The advantages of this
drain are manifold. It is executed at much less
expence than either of the former; and it is per∣pertual,
as it never can be obstructed. In level
ground, it is true, grass may grow at the bottom
of the drain; but to clear off the grass once in
four or five years, will restore it to its original
perfection. A hollow drain may be proper be∣tween
the spring-head and the main drain, where
the distance is not great; but in every other case
the drain recommended is the best.</P>
<P>Where a level field is infested with water from
higher ground, the water ought to be intercepted
by a ditch carried along the food of the high
ground, and terminating in some capital drain.</P>
<P>The only way to clear a field of water that is
hollow in the middle, is to carry it off by some
drain still lower. This is commonly the case of
a morass fed with water from higher ground, and
kept on the surface by a clay bottom.</P>
<P>A clay soil of any thickness is never pestered
with springs; but it is pestered with rain, which
settles on the surface as in a cup. The only re∣medy
is high narrow ridges, well rounded. And
<PB N="58" REF="84"/>
to clear the surrows, the furrow of the foot-ridge
ought to be considerably lower, in order to carry
off the water cleverly. It cannot be made too
low, as nothing hurts clay soil more than the stag∣nation
of water on it; witness the hollows at the
ends of crooked ridges, which are absolutely bar∣ren.
Some gravelly soils have a clay bottom,
which is a substantial benefit to a field when in
grass, as it retains moisture. But when in tillage,
ridges are necessary to prevent rain from settling
at the bottom; and this is the only case where a
gravelly soil ought to be ridged.</P>
<P>Clay soils that have little or no level, have some∣times
a gravelly bottom. For discharging the
water, the only method I can think of, is, at the
end of every ridge to pierce down to the gravel,
which will absorb the water. But if the furrow
of the foot-ridge be low enough to receive all
the water, it will be more expeditious to make a
few holes in that furrow. In some cases, a field
may be drained, by filling up the hollows with
earth taken from higher ground. But as this
method is expensive, it will only be taken where
no other method answers. Where a field hap∣pens
to be partly wet, partly dry, there ought to
be a separation by a middle ridge, if it can be
done conveniently. And the dry part may be
ploughed, while the other is drying.</P>
<P>The low part of Berwickshire is generally a
brick clay, extremely wet and poachy during win∣ter.
<PB N="59" REF="85"/>
This in a good measure may be prevented
by proper inclosing, as there is not a field but
can be drained into lower ground, all the way
down to the river Tweed. But as this would
lessen the quantity of rain in a dry climate, such
as is all the east side of Britain, it may admit of
some doubt whether the remedy would not be as
bad as the disease.</P>
<P>Broom and whins are great obstructions to crop∣ping.
Broom is an evergreen shrub that thrives
best in sandy soil; and there it grows so vigo∣rously,
as scarce to admit any grass under it. A
plant of broom that has arrived to its full size,
dies when cut over: but this does not root out
broom, because it grows from seed lodged in the
ground; beside, that there can be no cropping
while the stumps remain. An effectual way to
root out this plant, is, after cutting the great stems
close to the ground, to carry them off the field.
And the ground may be cleared of the roots, by
a Scotch plough with a spiked sock, drawn by
two oxen and two horses.</P>
<P>The field thus cleared may bear a crop of
oats, or two; and with proper manure may be
continued in tillage, or laid down with the seed
of pasture-grasses. The latter is preferable from
the nature of the soil, which is commonly sandy.</P>
<P>But as the seed of broom lies long in such soil
without rotting, the farmer may reckon upon a
plentiful crop from the seed along with the grass.
<PB N="60" REF="86"/>
To pull up the young broom with the hand, is an
expensive work; and for a large field it is difficult
to procure hands. Another method practised is,
to cut the young broom with a sythe. But the
broom comes up next year in double quantity;
for it springs from young roots, though not from
old.</P>
<P>Sheep are fond of broom, and devour greedily
every young shoot. In a pasture-field, a few
bushes make a shelter; and the cropping of sheep
prevents them in a good measure from spreading.
Broom has a singular effect upon sheep: it makes
them drunk so effectually, that when heated a
little with driving, they tumble over, and lie with∣out
motion. This suggests a method of rooting
out the young broom that grows with the pasture∣grasses,
which is to pasture the field with sheep.
If any escape the first year, there will not be left
a vestige after the second. Beside the easiness of
this method, it is profitable, as there is no food
more nourishing to sheep than young broom.</P>
<P>Where it is necessary or convenient to keep the
field in corn, horse-hoeing is the only way to sub∣due
broom. This fort of husbandry encourages
every seed to vegetate; and the frequent plough∣ings
that are necessary in a drilled crop, destroy
broom as well as other weeds. Some may escape
the first year, but they cannot escape subsequent
horse-hoeing.</P>
<P>A whin is a fine evergreen shrub, carrying a
<PB N="61" REF="87"/>
sweet-smelling flower all the year, except in frost.
But in husbandry, beauty is not regarded in op∣position
to profit. This shrub spreads wonder∣fully
in poor soil; and when once established, re∣quires
both art and labour to extirpate it. The
roots of broom push downward; and for that
reason, probably, broom springs not from the
root. The roots of a whin, on the contrary, push
horizontally, to the distance sometimes of ten or
twelve feet. While the plant is growing, it
draws the whole juices from the roots; but
when cut down, these juices push up suckers from
every root that lies near the surface. And hence
the difficulty of extirpating whins.</P>
<P>The best method is, to set fire to the whins in a
windy day during frost. Frost has the effect to
wither whins, and to make them burn readily:
the harder the frost, the better. Cut over the
stumps with a hatchet, and wait till the ground be
softened with rain. At that time, a firm plough
with a strong draught, will shatter all the roots
into shreds, which will be brought above ground
with a heavy brake. The expence of this opera∣tion
is small, compared with the common method
of rooting out whins with a hoe; and it is the
less to be grudged, as being done in wet weather,
when the plough cannot be otherwise employed.
Oxen are the fittest for this operation; because
they make a steady draught, and do not, like
<PB N="62" REF="88"/>
horses, give way when they meet with unexpected
resistance.</P>
<P>If the field be soon laid down in grass, whins
will spring up in abundance, not only from seed,
but from the small fibres that may have escaped
the plough and brake. Pasturing with sheep is
the only remedy: and it is an effectual remedy,
if applied immediately after the whins spring; for
sheep are no less fond of whins than of broom;
and if there be a sufficient number, they will not
leave a single plant above ground. Their spring∣ing
for years need not be repined at; for in their
infant state they are excellent food, equal to any
plant that grows. If this method be neglected
till the whins have grown into wood, sheep come
too late; they will feed on the tender parts, but
the bush continues healthy; of which we have ex∣amples
every where in open fields.</P>
<P>But if grass be not immediately wanted, horse∣hoeing
husbandry is the most effectual method for
clearing a field from whins. And when a field is
once enriched by labour and manure, one need
not be afraid of whins, as a poor soil is only pro∣per
for them.</P>
<P>Whins are a food so nourishing, not only to
sheep but to horned cattle, that a poor soil cannot
be better employed than in bearing crops of them:
they are eat pleasantly in their infant-state, while
the prickles are yet so tender as not to hurt the
mouth.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="89"/>
Having touched the article of food, though fo∣reign
to the present chapter, I am excited to ob∣serve,
that the tops of the oldest whins, cut off
with a hedge-bill, make a hearty food for cattle
when boiled. And to encrease the doze, thistles,
every bulky weed, and the roots of cabbage, may
be boiled with the whins. This I am informed is
an ordinary practice in Germany.</P>
<P>Molehills may be justly considered as an ob∣struction
to cropping. It is therefore beneficial to
destroy moles; and the simplest way is, to lay hold
of the young, which are always found in mole∣hills
larger than ordinary. Buffon is uncertain
whether they breed more than once a-year; but
says, that young moles are found from April to
August. What I found, were generally between
the first of May new style and the first of May
old style.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>2. BRINGING INTO CULTURE LAND from the
STATE of NATURE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following method of improving a moor is
contained in a letter addressed to me by an expert
farmer. “I began with ploughing as much of
the moor as I had a prospect of dung for. It
was cross-ploughed next spring, and well har∣rowed.
About Midsummer, it was ploughed
again in the direction of the first ploughing, and
well harrowed. It was ploughed the fourth
<PB N="64" REF="90"/>
time before winter, but not harrowed. It got
the fifth ploughing in the succeeding April, at
which time the sward was well broken and rot∣ted.
It was dunged liberally; and after plough∣ing
the dung into the ground, I sowed turnip.
New ground, however poor originally, never
disappointed me of a rich crop of turnip the first
year, barley or oats the second, and clover and
rye-grass the third. And yet there are several
late instances of turnip failing in the best infield
grounds, among my neighbours and in my own
farm. In the year 1759, unwilling to trust the
whole of my turnip-crop to the moor, I prepared
and dunged part of my best infield, and sowed
it with turnip. Not a single drill appeared from
the first sowing; and but a scanty crop from
the third: in the moor not a single drill failed.
I was anxious to discover the cause: I could
not attribute the difference to soil or situation,
which were in favour of the infield; and the
management was the same. The black fly, it
is true, had destroyed the infield crop; but I
was puzzled why they had abstained from the
moor. Upon examining narrowly the two
fields, I discovered that the black flies in the
infield were young and very small, not able to
fly, but only to creep or hop about. Not a
single fly could be seen in the moor. This led
me to the following speculation. Nature has
taught the various tribes of flies and insects, to
<PB N="65" REF="91"/>
deposit their eggs in places the best adapted for
the production and nourishment of their young.
Warm and rich grounds answer these purposes
the best: moor-grounds are cold and barren.
I reflected further, that when once these insects
chuse for their habitation a rich soil where there
is plenty of food, they deposit their eggs there;
and the race is propagated from year to year.
A vacuity of ten or twelve yards in one of the
moor-drills seemed not to square with my theo∣ry.
But upon enquiry I found, that a small
shower of rain had stopped the holes of the
drill-box a little time.”</P>
<P>So far my correspondent. His method is good;
but it is laborious; and the soil with three
ploughings may be rendered as proper for turnip,
as with the six he gave it. The following altera∣tion
is what I propose. Let the moor be opened
in winter when it is wet; which has one conve∣nience,
that the plough cannot be employed at
any other work. In spring, after frost is over a
slight harrowing will fill up the seams with mould,
to keep out the air and rot the sod. In that state
let it lie the following summer and winter, which
will rot the sod more than if laid open to the air
by ploughing. Next April, let it be cross-plough∣ed,
braked, and harrowed, till it be sufficiently
pulverized. Let the manure laid upon it, whe∣ther
lime or dung, be intimately mixed with the
soil by repeated harrowings. This will make a
<PB N="66" REF="92"/>
fine bed for the turnip-seed, if sown broad-cast.
But if drills be intended, the method must be
followed that is directed afterward in treating
more directly of the culture of turnip.</P>
<P>Repeated experience has convinced me, that
turnip in moorish ground runs no risk from the
black fly, nor probably in any ground newly bro∣ken
up. It is an old observation of gardeners,
that their plants thrive best in new ground; for
what other reason, than that they have no ene∣mies
to destroy them? It must give pleasure to
those who wish prosperity to their country, to be
informed, that moorish grounds of a tolerable soil
are fit for producing turnip; a profitable crop of
itself, and still more profitable by preparing the
ground for subsequent crops. Considering the
immense quantity of moor in Scotland, it must
give pain to think how little progress is made in
its cultivation. We see a fair example given near
twenty years ago, neither expensive nor intricate.
Why does not every farmer exert his utmost in∣dustry
upon so valuable an improvement? Custom
fetters men in chains. To break loose from
slavery, a man must be blessed by nature with a
superior degree of understanding and activity.
Such men there are, though rare: their example
will be imitated; and it is a pleasing prospect, that
our barren moors will in time be converted in∣to
good soil, productive of nourishment for man
and beast: villages will arise, and population go
<PB N="67" REF="93"/>
on in a rapid course. I present to the view of
my reader an immense moor between Greenlaw
in Berwickshire, and Fala in Mid Lothian, as a
desireable subject for an improving farmer, now
that there is access to lime by a turnpike-road.
As the soil for the most part is too shallow for
paring and burning, it may be cultivated accor∣ding
to the directions given above. At the same
time there are many swampy spots, which upon
paring and burning will yield a great quantity of
ashes, to be laid upon the dry parts; and these
ashes make the very best manure for turnip. The
method for preparing swampy land for turnip is
described below, in treating upon the culture of
turnip. A successful turnip-crop, fed on the
ground with sheep, is a fine preparation for laying
down a field with grass-seeds. It is an improve∣ment
upon this method, to take two or three suc∣cessive
crops of turnip, which will require no dung
for the second and following crops. This will
thicken the soil, and enrich it greatly. In that
high country, where rain superabounds, the pro∣fitable
crop is grass, not corn. And farms in that
country, after being improved, ought to be di∣vided
into inclosures of fifty or sixty acres. Sheep
require a hundred acres, to give them space for
an extensive walk; and in such an inclosure any
fence keeps them in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Scotland probably was mostly covered with trees before the commencement of agriculture; from which we ought to expect its surface to be generally vegetable soil. Yet most of it is barren earth, without any mixture of vegetable soil. Did much large tracts never carry trees? I can hardly think so, as trees are found growing in the most barren spots. Yet in America, which abounds with trees, one in some places may travel several hundred miles without seeing a tree. This ap∣pears difficult to be accounted for.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="94"/>
The best way of improving swampy ground after
draining, is paring and burning. But where the
ground is dry, and the soil so thin as that the surface
cannot be pared, the best way of bringing it into
tilth from the state of nature, as mentioned above,
is to plough it with a feathered sock, laying the
grassy surface under. After the new surface is
mellowed with frost, fill up all the seams by har∣rowing
cross the field, which by excluding the
air will effectually rot the sod. In this state let it
lie summer and winter. In the beginning of May
after, a cross ploughing will reduce all to small
square pieces, which must be pulverized with the
brake, and make it ready for a May or June crop.
If these square pieces be allowed to lie long in the
sap without brakeing, they will become tough and
not be easily reduced.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>3. FORMING RIDGES.</HEAD>
<P>THE first thing that occurs on this head, is to
consider what grounds ought to be formed into
<PB N="69" REF="95"/>
ridges, and what ought to be tilled with a flat sur∣face.
Dry soils, which suffer by lack of moi∣sture,
ought to be tilled flat, which tends to re∣tain
moisture. And the method for such tilling,
is to go round and round from the circumference
to the centre, or from the centre to the circum∣ference.
This method is advantageous in point
of expedition, as the whole is finished without
once turning the plough. At the same time, e∣very
inch of the soil is moved, instead of leaving
either the crown or the furrow unmoved, as is
commonly done in tilling ridges. Clay soil, which
suffers by water standing on it, ought to be laid
as dry as possible by proper ridges. A loamy soil
is the middle between the two mentioned. It
ought to be tilled flat in a dry country, especially
if it incline to the soil first mentioned. In a moist
country, it ought to be formed into ridges, high
or low according to the degree of moisture, and
tendency to clay.</P>
<P>In grounds that require ridging, an error pre∣vails,
that ridges cannot be raised too high. High
ridges labour under several disadvantages. The
soil is heaped upon the crown, leaving the furrows
bare: the crown is too dry, and the furrows too
wet: the crop, which is always best on the crown,
is more readily shaken with the wind, than where
the whole crop is of an equal height: the half of
the ridge is always covered from the sun, a disad∣vantage
which is far from being slight in a cold
<PB N="70" REF="96"/>
climate. High ridges labour under another dis∣advantage
in ground that has no more level than
barely sufficient to carry off water: they sink the
furrows below the level of the ground; and con∣sequently
retain water at the end of every ridge.
The furrows ought never to be sunk below the
level of the ground. Water will more effectually
be carried off, by lessening the ridges both in
height and breadth: a narrow ridge, the crown
of which is but eighteen inches higher than the
furrow, has a greater slope, than a very broad
ridge where the difference is three or four feet.</P>
<P>Next of forming ridges where the ground hangs
considerably. Ridges may be too steep as well as
too horizontal; and if to the ridges be given all the
steepness of a field, a heavy shower may do irre∣parable
mischief. One instance I was witness to.
A hanging field had been carefully dressed with
lime and dung for turnip. The turnip was fairly
above ground, when a fatal summer-shower sweep∣ed
down turnip, lime, dung, and a quantity of
the tender soil, leaving the land bare. To pre∣vent
such mischief, the ridges ought to be so di∣rected
cross the field, as to have a gentle slope for
carrying off water slowly, and no more. In that
respect, a hanging field has greatly the advantage
of one that is nearly horizontal; because in the
latter, there is no opportunity of a choice in
forming the ridges. A hill is of all the best ad∣apted
for directing the ridges properly. If the soil
<PB N="71" REF="97"/>
be gravelly, it may be ploughed round and round,
beginning at the bottom and ascending gradually to
the top in a spiral line. This method of ploughing
a hill, requires no more force than ploughing on a
level; and at the same time removes the great in∣convenience
of a gravelly hill, that rain goes off
too quickly; for the rain is retained in every fur∣row.
If the soil be such as to require ridges, they
may be directed to any slope that is proper.</P>
<P>In order to form a field into ridges that has not
been formerly cultivated, the rules mentioned are
easily put in execution. But what if ridges be
already formed, that are either crooked or too
high? After seeing the advantage of forming a
field into ridges, people were naturally led into an
error, that the higher the better. But what could
tempt them to make their ridges crooked? I an∣swer,
Not of design, but by the laziness of the dri∣ver
suffering the cattle to turn too hastily, instead
of making them finish the ridge without turning.
There is more than one disadvantage in this slo∣venly
practice. First, the water is kept in by the
curve at the end of every ridge, and sours the
ground. Next, as a plough has the least friction
possible in a straight line, the friction must be in∣creased
in a curve, the back part of the mould∣board
pressing hard on the one hand, and the
coulter pressing hard on the other. In the third
place, the plough moving in a straight line, has
the greatest command in laying the earth over.
<PB N="72" REF="98"/>
But where the straight line of the plough is ap∣plied
to the curvature of a ridge in order to
heighten it by gathering, the earth moved by the
plough is continually falling back, in spite of the
most skilful ploughman.</P>
<P>The inconveniencies of ridges high and crook∣ed,
are so many, that one would be tempted to
apply a remedy at any risk. And yet, if the soil
be clay, I would not advise a tenant to apply the
remedy upon a lease shorter than two nineteen
years. In a dry gravelly soil, the work is not
difficult, nor hazardous. When the ridges are
cleaved two or three years successively in the course
of cropping, the operation ought to be concluded
in one summer. The earth, by reiterated plough∣ings,
should be accumulated upon the furrows, so
as to raise them higher than the crowns: they
cannot be raised too high, for the accumulated
earth will subside by its own weight. Cross-plough∣ing
once or twice, will reduce the ground to a flat
surface, and give opportunity to form ridges at
will. The same method brings down ridges in
clay soil: only let care be taken to carry on the
work with expedition; because a hearty shower
before the new ridges are formed, would soak
the ground in water, and make the farmer sus∣pend
his work for the remainder of that year at
least. In a strong clay, I would not venture to
alter the ridges, unless it can be done to perfec∣tion
in one season.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="99"/>
In the operation of flattening ridges, there is a
circumstance that has scarce ever been attended
to. Ridges are evidently an improvement of
art; and so is manure. The soil must have been
exhausted by frequent cropping before either
ridges or dung were attempted; and after ridges
were formed, the soil under the crowns must
have continued in its exhausted state, being de∣prived
of the benefit both of sun and rain. We
find these conjectures verified by experience.
When a ridged field is made level as originally,
the soil immediately under the crown, which had
the thickest covering, is commonly exceedingly
poor. Farmers, sensible of this, never fail to give
more dung to that part than to the rest of the
field. But a more effectual remedy is, to pierce
deeper than the original surface with the spade or
plough, in order to bring up virgin soil. This
soil is generally good; and the whole is made e∣qually
fertile, by mixing it with the exhausted
soil in cross ploughing and harrowing. In the
low country of Berwickshire, I frequently used
this remedy, and never was disappointed. In
making ditches there for draining, I have brought
up a brick-clay lying four feet under the surface,
which, without being mellowed either by sun or
frost, carried oats of a surprising size. Wild
plants may be seen every where much larger than
ordinary, growing even in gravel thrown up from
the bottom of a new-made ditch.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="100"/>
Let it be a rule, to direct the ridges north and
south if the ground will permit. In this direc∣tion,
the east and west sides of the ridges, divi∣ding
the sun equally between them, will ripen at the
same time.</P>
<P>It is a great advantage in agriculture, to form
ridges so narrow, and so low, as to admit the
crowns and furrows to be changed alternately
every crop. The soil nearest the surface is the
best; and by such ploughing, it is always kept
near the surface, and never buried. In high
ridges, the soil is accumulated at the crown, and
the furrows left bare. Such alteration of crown
and furrow, is easy where the ridges are no more
but seven or eight feet broad. This mode of
ploughing answers perfectly well in sandy and
gravelly soils, and even in loam. But it is not
safe in clay soil. In that soil, the ridges ought
to be twelve feet wide and twenty inches high;
to be preserved always in the same form by cast∣ing,
that is, by ploughing two ridges together,
beginning at the furrow that separates them, and
ploughing round and round till the two ridges be
finished. By this method, the separating surrow
is raised a little higher than the furrows that
bound the two ridges. But at the next plough∣ing,
that inequality is corrected, by beginning at
the bounding furrows, and going round and
round till the ploughing of the two ridges be com∣pleted
at the separating surrow.</P>

<HEAD>4. CLEARING GROUND of WEEDS.</HEAD>
<P>THE farmer views plants in a very different
light from the botanist. All are weeds with the
farmer that give obstruction to the plants he pro∣pagates
in his farm. These I distinguish into two
kinds, that require different management, viz.—annuals,—and
all that have a longer existence,
which I shall comprehend under the general
name of <HI>pereimials.</HI> It is vain to expect a
crop of corn from land over-run with couch-grass,
knot-grass, or other perennial weeds; and yet
the time may be remembered, when, among
Scotch farmers, it was a disputed point, whether
such weeds were not more profitable than hurtful.
Some found them profitable in binding their
light land: the getting a plentiful crop of straw
and hay for their cattle, weighed with others. I
should be ashamed of exposing ignorance so gross
in my countrymen, could I not say, that they
now understand the matter better, though few of
them hitherto have arrived at the perfection of
cleaning. Summer-fallow is the general method;
and excellent it is, though it doth not always
prove effectual. The roots of couch-grass in par∣ticular
are long, and full of juice: if a single joint
be left in the ground, it never fails to spring.
Here the common harrow is of very little use, its
teeth being too wide. The time relied on by our
<PB N="76" REF="102"/>
farmers for destroying couch-grass, is in preparing
for barley. After the harrow has raised part of a
root above ground, men, women, and children,
are employed to pull it up. There are only two
objections to this method: the expence is one;
and another is, that after all this expence, many
roots are left in the ground. In order to pave
the way for rooting out perennials effectually, and
with little expence, I take liberty to introduce a
new instrument, which I term a <HI>cleaning har∣row.</HI>
It is of one entire piece, like the first of
those mentioned above, consisting of seven bulls,
four feet long each, two and one fourth inches
broad, two and three fourths deep. The bulls
are united together by sheths, similar to what are
mentioned above. The intervals between the
bulls being three and three fourths inches, the
breadth of the whole harrow is three feet five
inches. In each bull are inserted eight teeth,
each nine inches free below the wood, and di∣stant
from each other six inches. The weight of
each tooth is a pound, or near it. The whole is
firmly bound by an iron plate from corner to cor∣ner
in the line of the draught. The rest as in
the harrows mentioned above. The size, how∣ever,
is not invariable. The cleaning harrow
ought to be larger or less according as the soil
is stiff or free. See the figure annexed.</P>
<P>To give this instrument its full effect, stones
of such a size as not to pass freely between the
<PB N="77" REF="103"/>
teeth, ought to be carried off, and clods of that
size ought to be broken. The ground ought to
be dry, which it is commonly in the month of
May.</P>
<P>In preparing for barley, turnip, or other sum∣mer-crop,
begin with ploughing and cross-plough∣ing.
If the ground be not sufficiently pulverized,
let the great brake be applied, to be followed suc∣cessively
with the harrows, N<SUP>O</SUP> 1. and N<SUP>O</SUP> 2. In
stiff soil rolling may be proper, once or twice be∣tween
the acts. These operations will loosen e∣very
root, and bring some of them to the surface.
This is the time for the harrow, N<SUP>O</SUP> 3. conducted
by a boy mounted on one of the horses, who trots
smartly along the field, and brings all the roots to
the surface: there they are to lie for a day or two
till perfectly dry. If any stones or clods remain,
they must be carried off in a cart. And now suc∣ceeds
the operation of the cleaning harrow. It
is drawn by a single horse, directed by reins,
which the man at the opposite corner puts over
his head, in order to have both hands free. In
this corner is fixed a rope, with which the man
from time to time raises the harrow from the
ground, to let the weeds drop. For the sake of
expedition, the weeds ought to be dropt in a
straight line cross the field, whether the harrow
be full or not; and seldom is a field so dirty but
that the harrow may go thirty yards before the
teeth are filled. The weeds will be thus laid in
<PB N="78" REF="104"/>
parallel rows, like those of hay raked together
for drying. A harrow may be drawn swiftly a∣long
the rows, in order to shake out all the dust;
and then the weeds may be carried clean off the
field in carts. But we are not yet done with these
weeds: instead of burning, which is the ordinary
practice, they may be converted into useful ma∣nure,
by laying them in a heap with a mixture of
hot dung to begin fermentation. What better
politic than to make a friend of a foe! At first
view, this way of cleaning land will appear ope∣rose;
but upon trial, neither the labour nor ex∣pence
will be found immoderate. So far from it,
that I believe it will not be easy to name any other
way of cleaning ground effectually, that costs so
little. At any rate, the labour and expence
ought not to be grudged; for if a field be once
thoroughly cleaned, the seasons must be very
cross, or the farmer very indolent, to make it ne∣cessary
to renew the operation in less than twenty
years. In the worst seasons, à few years pasture
is always under command; which effectually de∣stroys
triennial plants, such as thistles and couch∣grass.</P>
<P>Fog is one of the most pernicious weeds that
enter into a grass-field: in a very dry soil, it usurps
upon the good plants, wears them out, and co∣vers
the whole surface. I have tried lime and
dung to very little purpose. Coal-ashes do better:
they keep back the fog a few years; but it reco∣vers
<PB N="79" REF="105"/>
strength gradually as the ashes lose their in∣fluence,
and prevails as much as before. Some
writers talk of rolling, because fog is never seen
on a foot-path. They do not advert, that the
continual treading of feet on a narrow path, con∣solidates
the ground more, and makes it more
retentive of moisture, than rolling can do. Nor
do they advert, that fog is the most plentiful in
dry ground, where the weightiest roller makes no
impression. As fog prospers the most on the
driest ground, the laying the field under water a
whole winter, will destroy it. There is reason how∣ever
to suspect, that the fog will encroach again,
when the moisture is exhausted, and the soil returns
to its arid state; not to mention the many fields
that lie out of the reach of water. One infallible
method there is; which is, to cover the ground an
inch thick with soil retentive of moisture, and to
mix it with the original soil by the plough and har∣row.
Thus will fog be banished, and the soil at
the same time enriched. But the good soil here
must be at hand: it would be too expensive to
bring it from a distance. Lucky it is, after
all, that there still remains an infallible method,
which, instead of being expensive, is extremely
profitable. It will be made evident afterward, in
laying down rules for rotation of crops, that a
quick succession of corn and grass, is more profit∣able,
than to allow any ground to continue long
in either. Therefore, as soon as fog begins to
<PB N="80" REF="106"/>
prevail, plough up the ground for a crop of
corn<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following method is proposed by Dr Home for destroying <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>og. “Shut up the inclosure from the mid∣dle of May till the beginning of December: feed it till April, and then save it for a crop of hay. The fog, being so long covered with grass, is cut off from the benefit of the air, and dies.” I doubt. Over∣shadowing the fog may retard its progress; but as it does not correct the dryness of the soil, it is not likely to extirpate the fog.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Next, of annual weeds, which are propagated
by seed. As <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeds cannot be gathered out of the
ground like roots, the only way of destroying
them, is to promote their vegetation; which lays
them open to be extirpated by the plough or har∣row.
For want of industry, annual weeds pre∣vail
in many parts of this island, in the best soils
especially. To view a crop near a town, end of
May or beginning of June, one would believe it
to be a crop of charlock or wild mustard. These
plants, it is true, lose their splendid appearance
after their flowering is over; but they remain to
encumber the ground. As they ripen, and drop
their feed long before the corn is ripe, they mul∣tiply
more and more. They not only rob the
ground, and starve the good grain, but prevent
circulation of air about the roots, which is a great
impediment to vegetation. Freedom of circula∣tion
is one of the causes that make drilled crops
succeed so well. What must have been the con∣dition
<PB N="81" REF="107"/>
of corn-land in Scotland before fallowing
was known!</P>
<P>And now to the destruction of such weeds.
Summer-fallow, among its other advantages, does
this effectually, by observing the following me∣thod.
Begin with ploughing in April as soon as the
ground is dry; and let the brake succeed cross the
field; which by pulverising the soil, will promote
the vegetation of every seed. As soon as the
weeds appear, which may be in ten or twelve days
according to the season, plough and brake as be∣fore:
the plough will make many seeds vegetate;
the brake still more. Proceed in the same course
while any weeds appear. In the heat of summer,
rolling not only promotes vegetation by keeping
in the moisture, but bruises the clods which lock
up many seeds.</P>
<P>This process requires the following precaution.
Avoid ploughing or brakeing when the ground is
wet. The stirring wet ground hardens it, ex∣cludes
the sun and air, and prevents vegetation.</P>
</DIV4>

<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">CULTURE OF PLANTS FOR FOOD.</HEAD>
<P>THE articles hitherto insisted on, are all of
them preparatory to the capital object of a
farm, that of raising plants for the nourishment of
<PB N="82" REF="108"/>
man, and of other animals. These are of two
kinds; culmiferous, and leguminous, differing
widely from each other. Wheat, rye, barley,
oats, ryegrass, are of the first kind: of the other
kind are pease, beans, clover, cabbage, and many
others. Culmiferous plants, says Bonnet, have
three sets of roots. The first issue from the seed,
and push to the surface an upright stem; an∣other
set issue from a knot in that stem; and a
third, from another knot, nearer the surface.
Hence the advantage of laying seed so deep in the
ground as to afford space for all the sets. Legu∣minous
plants form their roots differently. Pease,
beans, cabbage, have store of small roots, all is∣suing
from the seed, like the undermost set of cul∣miferous
roots; and they have no other roots.
A potato and a turnip have bulbous roots. Red
clover has a strong tap-root. The difference be∣tween
culmiferous and leguminous plants with re∣spect
to the effects they produce in the soil, will
be insisted on afterward, in the chapter concerning
rotation of crops. As the present chapter is con∣fined
to the propagation of plants, it falls natural∣ly
to be divided into three sections: First, plants
cultivated for fruit; Second, plants cultivated for
roots; Third, plants cultivated for leaves.</P>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<PB N="83" REF="109"/>
<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PLANTS CULTIVATED FOR FRUIT.</HEAD>
<P>WHEAT, oats, barley, beans, and pease,
are the plants that are mostly cultivated
in Scotland for fruit. I begin with wheat.</P>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>1. WHEAT and RYE.</HEAD>
<P>ANY time from the middle of April to the
middle of May, the fallowing for wheat may com∣mence.
The moment should be chosen, when
the ground, beginning to dry, has yet some re∣maining
softness: in that condition, the soil di∣vides
easily by the plough, and falls into small
parts. This is an essential article, deserving the
strictest attention of the farmer. Ground plough∣ed
too wet, rises, as we say, <HI>whole-fur,</HI> as when
pasture-ground is ploughed: where ploughed too
dry, it rises in great lumps, which are not redu∣ced
by subsequent ploughings; not to mention,
that it requires double force to plough ground too
dry, and that the plough is often broken to pieces.
When the ground is in proper order, the farmer
can have no excuse for delaying a single minute.
This first course of fallow, must, it is true, yield
to the barley-seed; but as the barley-seed is com∣monly
over the first week of May, or sooner, the
<PB N="84" REF="110"/>
season must be unfavourable if the fallow cannot
be reached by the middle of May.</P>
<P>As clay soil requires high ridges, these ought
to be cleaved at the first ploughing, beginning at
the furrow, and ending at the crown. This
ploughing ought to be as deep as the soil will ad∣mit;
and water-furrowing ought instantly to fol∣low:
for if rain happen before water-furrowing, it
stagnates in the furrow, necessarily delays the se∣cond
ploughing till that part of the ridge be dry,
and prevents the furrow from being mellowed, and
roasted by the sun. If this first ploughing be well
executed, annual weeds will rise in plenty. A∣bout
the first week of June, the great brake will
loosen and reduce the soil, encourage a second
crop of annuals, and raise to the surface the roots
of weeds moved by the plough. Give the weeds
time to spring, which may be in two or three
weeks. Then proceed to the second ploughing
about the beginning of July; which must be cross
the ridges, in order to reach all the slips of the for∣mer
ploughing. By cross-ploughing, the furrows
will be filled up, and water-furrowing be still
more necessary than before. Employ the brake
again about the 10th of August, to destroy the
annuals that have sprung since the last stirring.
The destruction of weeds is a capital article in fal∣lowing:
yet so blind are people to their interest,
that nothing is more common, than a fallow field
covered with charlock and wild mustard, all in
<PB N="85" REF="111"/>
flower, and ten or twelve inches high. The field
having now received two harrowings and two
brakeings, is prepared for manure, whether lime
or dung, which without delay ought to be incor∣porated
with the soil, by repeated harrowing and
a gathering furrow. This ought to be about the
beginning of September; and as soon after as you
please the seed may be sown.</P>
<P>As in ploughing a clay soil it is of importance
to prevent poaching, the hinting furrows ought to
be done with two horses in a line. If four ploughs
be employed in the same field, to one of them
may be allotted the care of finishing the hinting
furrows. What will one think, who has never
been in the Highlands, of four horses abreast in
a plough, the driver going backward, and striking
the horses on the head to make them come for∣ward?
The ignorant and illiterate are strangely
dull in point of invention: but let the most stupid
practice turn once customary, and it is rivetted in
them for ever. Is it not obvious, that four horses
abreast must tread down the new-moved soil, and
reduce it to as firm a state as before the plough
entered?</P>
<P>Next of dressing loam for wheat. Loam, being
a medium between sand and clay, is of all soils
the fittest for culture, and the least subject to
chances. It does not hold water like clay; and
when wet it dries sooner. At the same time it
is more retentive than sand of that degree of moi∣sture
<PB N="86" REF="112"/>
which promotes vegetation. On the other
hand, it is more subject to couch-grass than clay,
and to other weeds; to destroy which, fallowing
is still more necessary than in clay.</P>
<P>Beginning the fallow about the first of May, or
as soon as barley-seed is over, take as deep a fur∣row
as the soil will admit. Where the ridges are
so low and narrow as that the crown and furrow
can be changed alternately, there is little or no
occasion for water-furrowing. Where the ridges
are so high as to make it proper to cleave them,
water-furrowing is proper. The second plough∣ing
may be at the distance of five weeks. Two
crops of annuals may be got in the interim, the
first by the brake, and the next by the harrow;
and by the same means eight crops may be got in
the season. The ground must be cleared of
couch-grass and knot-grass roots, by the cleaning
harrow, described above. The time for this o∣peration
is immediately before the manure is laid
on. The ground at that time being in its loosest
state, parts with its grass-roots more freely than
at any other time. After the manure is spread,
and incorporated with the soil by brakcing or har∣rowing,
the seed may be sown under surrow, if
the ground hang so as easily to carry off the moi∣sture.
To leave it rough without harrowing, has
two advantages: it is not apt to cake with moi∣sture;
and the inequalities make a sort of shelter
to the young plants against frost. But if it lie
<PB N="87" REF="113"/>
flat, it ought to be smoothed with a slight harrow
after the seed is sown, which will facilitate the
course of the rain from the crown to the furrow.</P>
<P>A sandy soil is too loose for wheat. The only
chance for a crop is after red clover, the roots of
which bind the soil; and the instructions above
given for loam are applicable here. Rye is a
crop much fitter for sandy soil than wheat; and
like wheat it is generally sown after a summer∣fallow.</P>
<P>Lastly, Sow wheat as soon in the month of Oc∣tober
as the ground is ready. When sown a
month more early, it is too forward in the spring,
and apt to be hurt by frost: when sown a month
later, it has not time to root before frost comes
on, and frost spews it out of the ground.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>2. OATS.</HEAD>
<P>As winter-ploughing enters into the culture of
oats, I must remind the reader of the effect of
frost upon tilled land. Providence has neglected
no region intended for the habitation of man. If
in warm climates the soil be meliorated by the
sun, it is no less meliorated by frost in cold cli∣mates.
Frost acts upon water, by expanding it
into a larger space. Frost has no effect upon dry
earth; witness sand, upon which it makes no im∣pression.
But upon wet earth it acts most vigor∣ously:
it expands the moisture, which requiring
<PB N="88" REF="114"/>
more space, puts every particle of the earth out
of its place, and separates them from each other.
In that view, frost may be considered as a plough
superior to any that is made, or can be made,
by the hand of man: its action reaches the mi∣nutest
particles; and, by dividing and separating
them, it renders the soil loose and friable. This
operation is the most remarkable in tilled land,
which gives free access to frost. With respect to
clay soil in particular, there is no rule in husban∣dry
more essential than to open it before winter
in hopes of frost. It is even adviseable in a clay
soil to leave the stubble rank, which, when
ploughed in before winter, keeps the clay loose,
and admits the frost into every eranny.</P>
<P>To apply this doctrine, it is dangerous to plough
clay soil when wet; because water is a cement
for clay, and binds it so as to render it unfit for
vegetation. It is however less dangerous to
plough wet clay before winter than after. A suc∣ceeding
frost corrects the bad effects of such
ploughing: a succeeding drought encreases them.
No rule is so easy to be followed as what I am in∣culcating;
and yet no other is so frequently trans∣gressed.
Many farmers have a sort of bastavd
industry, that prompts activity without over think∣ing
of consequences.</P>
<P>And now to the culture of oats, a culmiferous
plant. The common method is, to sow them on
new-ploughed land in the month of March, as
<PB N="89" REF="115"/>
soon as the ground is tolerably dry. If it conti∣nue
wet all the month of March, it is too late to
venture them after. It is much better to summer-fallow
and to sow wheat in the autumn. But the
preferable method, especially in clay soil, is to
turn over the field after harvest, and to lay it o∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n
to the influences of frost and air, which lessen
the tenacity of clay, and reduce it to a free mould.
The surface-soil by this means is finely mellowed
for neception of the seed; and it would be a pity
to bury it by a second ploughing before sowing.
In general, the bulk of clay soils are rich; and
skilful ploughing without dung, will probably give
a better crop than unskilful ploughing with dung.</P>
<P>Hitherto of natural clays. I must add a word
of carse clays which are artificial, whether left by
the sea, or sweeped down from higher grounds
by rain. The method commonly used of dressing
carse clay for oats, is, not to stir it till the ground
be dry in the spring, which seldom happens be∣fore
the first of March; and the seed is sown as
soon after as the ground is sufficiently dry for its
reception. Frost has a stronger effect on such
clays than on natural clay. And if the field be laid
open before winter, it is rendered so loose by frost
as to be soon drenched in water. The particles
at the same time are so small, as that the first
drought in spring makes the surface cake or crust.
The difficulty of reducing this crust into mould
for covering the oat-seed, has led farmers to de∣lay
<PB N="90" REF="116"/>
ploughing till the month of March. But we
are taught by experience, that this soil ploughed
before winter, is sooner dry than when the plough∣ing
is delayed till spring; and as early sowing is
a great advantage, the objection of the superficial
crusting is easily removed by the harrow, N<SUP>O</SUP> 1.
above described, which will produce abundance
of mould for covering the seed. The ploughing
before winter not only procures early sowing, but
has another advantage: the surface-soil that had
been mellowed during winter by the sun, frost,
and wind, is kept above. I have no experience
of managing carse clay in this manner; but to me
it appears greatly preferable to the common prac∣tice.</P>
<P>The dressing a loamy soil for oats, differs little
from dressing a clay soil, except in the following
particular, that being less hurt by rain, it requires
not high ridges; and therefore ought to be
ploughed crown and furrow alternately.</P>
<P>Where there is both clay and loam in a farm,
it is obvious from what is said above, that the
ploughing of the clay after harvest, ought first to
be dispatched. If both cannot be overtaken that
season, the loam may be delayed till the spring
with less hurt.</P>
<P>Next of a gravelly soil; which is the reverse of
clay, as it never suffers but from want of moi∣sture.
Such a soil ought to have no ridges; but
ploughed circularly from the centre to the cir∣cumference,
<PB N="91" REF="117"/>
or from the circumference to the
centre. It ought to be tilled after harvest; and
the first dry weather in spring ought to be laid
hold of to sow, harrow, and roll; which will pre∣serve
it in sap.</P>
<P>The culture of oats is the simplest of all. That
grain is probably a native of Britain: it will grow
on the worst soil with very little preparation. For
that reason, before turnip was introduced, it
was always the first crop upon land broken
up from the state of nature.</P>
<P>Upon such land, may it not be a good method,
to build up on the crown of every ridge, in the
form of a wall, all the surface-earth, one sod a∣bove
another, as in a fold for sheep? After stand∣ing
in this form all the summer and winter, let the
walls be thrown down, and the ground prepared
for oats. This will secure one or two good crops;
after which the land may be dunged for a crop of
barley and grass-seeds. This method may answer
in a farm where manure is scanty.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>3. BARLEY.</HEAD>
<P>BARLEY is a culmiferous plant that requires a
mellow soil. Upon that account, extraordinary
care is requisite where it is to be sown in clay.
The land ought to be stirred immediately after
the foregoing crop is removed, which lays it o∣pen
to be mellowed with the frost and air. In
<PB N="92" REF="118"/>
that view, a peculiar sort of ploughing has been
introduced, termed <HI>ribbing;</HI> by which the great∣est
quantity of surface possible is exposed to the
air and frost. The obvious objection to this me∣thod
is, that half of the ridge is left unmoved.
And to obviate that objection, I offer the follow∣ing
method, which moves the whole soil, and at
the same time exposes the same quantity of sur∣face
to the frost and air. This I esteem a valuable
improvement; and I am only in pain about ma∣king
it to be clearly understood. As soon as the
former crop is off the field, let the ridges be ga∣thered
with as deep a furrow as the soil will ad∣mit,
beginning at the crown and ending at the
furrows. This ploughing loosens the whole soil,
giving free access to the air and frost. Soon af∣ter,
begin a second ploughing in the following
manner. Let the field be divided by parallel
lines cross the ridges, with intervals of thirty feet
or so. Plough once round an interval, begin∣ning
at the edges, and turning the earth toward
the middle of the interval; which covers a foot
or so of the ground formerly ploughed. Within
that foot plough another round similar to the for∣mer;
and after that other rounds, till the whole
interval be finished, ending at the middle. In∣stead
of beginning at the edges, and ploughing
toward the middle, it will have the same effect to
begin at the middle and to plough toward the
edges. Plough the other intervals in the same
<PB N="93" REF="119"/>
manner. As by this operation the furrows of the
ridges will be pretty much filled up, let them be
cleared and water-furrowed without delay. By
this method, the field will be left waving like a
plot in a kitchen-garden, ridged up for winter. In
this form, the field is kept perfectly dry; for be∣side
the capital furrows that separate the ridges,
every ridge has a number of cross furrows that
carry the rain instantly to the capital furrows. In
hanging grounds retentive of moisture, the paral∣lel
lines above mentioned ought not to be perpen∣dicular
to the furrows of the ridges, but to be
directed a little downward, in order to carry rain∣water
the more hastily to these furrows. If the
ground be clean, it may lie in that state winter
and spring, till the time of seed-furrowing. If
weeds happen to rise, they must be destroyed by
ploughing, or brakeing, or both; for there can∣not
be worse husbandry, than to put seed into dir∣ty
ground.</P>
<P>This method resembles common ribbing in ap∣pearance,
but is very different in reality. As the
common ribbing is not preceded by a gathering
furrow, the half of the field is left untilled, com∣pact
as when the former crop was removed, im∣pervious
in a great measure to air or frost. The
common ribbing at the same time lodges the rain∣water
on every ridge, preventing it from descend∣ing
to the furrows; which is hurtful in all soils,
and poisonous in a clay soil. The stitching here
<PB N="94" REF="120"/>
described, or ribbing if you please to call it
so, prevents these noxious effects. By the two
ploughings the whole soil is opened, admitting
freely air and frost; and the multitude of fur∣rows
lays the surface perfectly dry, giving an ear∣ly
opportunity for the barley-seed.—But I have
more to say in favour of the method proposed.
When it is proper to sow the seed, all is laid flat
with the brake, which is an easy operation upon
soil that is dry and pulverized; and the seed-fur∣row
which succeeds, is so shallow as to bury little
or none of the surface-earth: whereas the stir∣ring
for barley is commonly done with the deep∣est
furrow; and consequently buries all the sur∣face-soil
that was mellowed by the frost and air.
Nor is this method more expensive; because the
common ribbing must always be followed with a
stirring furrow, which is saved in the method re∣commended.
Nay, it is less expensive; for after
common ribbing, which keeps in the rain-water,
the ground is commonly so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oured, as to make
the stirring a laborious work.</P>
<P>Where the land is in good order, and free of
weeds, April is the month for sowing barley. E∣very
day is proper from the first to the last.</P>
<P>The dressing loamy soil and light soil for bar∣ley,
is the same with that described; only that to
plough dry is not altogether so essential as in dres∣sing
clay soil. Loam or sand may be stirred a
little moist: better, however, delay a week or
<PB N="95" REF="121"/>
two, than to stir a loam when moist. Clay must
never be ploughed moist, even though the sca∣son
should escape altogether. But this will seldom
be necessary; for not in one year of twenty will
it happen, but that clay is dry enough for plough∣ing
some time in May. Frost may correct clay
ploughed wet after harvest; but ploughed wet in
the spring, it unites into a hard mass, not to be
dissolved but by very hard labour.</P>
<P>The foregoing culmiferous plants are what are
ordinarily propagated for food in Scotland. What
follow are leguminous plants. And I begin with
beans, being sown the earliest in spring.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>4. BEANS.</HEAD>
<P>THE properest soil for beans is a deep and moist
clay.</P>
<P>There was lately introduced into Scotland a me∣thod
of sowing beans with a drill-plough, and
horse-hocing the intervals; which, beside afford∣ing
a good crop, is a dressing to the ground. But
as that method is far from being general, I keep
in the common track.</P>
<P>As this grain is early sown, the ground intend∣ed
for it should be ploughed before winter, to give
access to the frost and air; beneficial in all soils,
and necessary in a clay soil. Take the first oppor∣tunity
after January when the ground is dry, to
loosen the soil with the harrow first described, till
a mould be brought upon it. Sow the seed,
<PB N="96" REF="122"/>
and cover it with the second harrow. The third
will smooth the surface, and cover the seed
equally. These harrows make the very best
figure in sowing beans; which ought to be laid
deep in the ground, not less than six inches.
In clay soil, the common harrows are altogether
insufficient. The soil, which has rested long after
ploughing, is rendered compact and solid: the
common harrows skim the surface: the seed is not
covered; and the first hearty shower of rain lays
it above ground. Where the farmer overtakes
not the ploughing after harvest, and is reduced to
plough immediately before sowing, the plough
answers the purpose of the first harrow; and the
other two will complete the work. But the la∣bour
of the first harrow is ill saved; as the plough∣ing
before winter is a fine preparation, not only
for beans, but for grain of every kind. If the
ground ploughed before winter happen by super∣fluity
of moisture to cake, the first harrow going
along the ridges, and crossing them, will loosen the
surface, and give access to the air for drying. As
soon as the ground is dry, sow without delaying a
moment. If rain happen in the interim, there is
no remedy but patience till a dry day or two
come.</P>
<P>Carse clay, ploughed before winter, seldom fails
to cake. Upon that account, a second ploughing
is necessary before sowing; which ought to be per∣formed
with an ebb furrow, in order to keep the
frost-mould as near the surface as possible. To
<PB N="97" REF="123"/>
cover the seed with the plough is expressed by the
phrase <HI>to sow under furrow.</HI> The clods raised in
this ploughing, are a sort of shelter to the young
plants in the chilly spring-months.</P>
<P>The foregoing method will answer for loam.
And as for a sandy or gravelly soil, it is altoge∣ther
improper for beans.</P>
<P>Though I cannot recommend the horse-hoing
of beans, with the intervals that are commonly
allotted for turnip, yet I warmly recommend the
drilling them at the distance of ten or twelve
inches, and keeping the intervals clean of weeds.
This may be done by hand-hoeing, taking oppor∣tunity
at the same time to lay fresh soil to the roots
of the plants. But as this is an expensive opera∣tion,
and hands are not always to be got, I propose
a narrow plough, drawn by a single horse, with a
mouldboard on each side to scatter the earth upon
the roots of the plants. This is a cheap and ex∣peditious
method: it keeps the ground clean;
and nourishes the plants with fresh soil.</P>
<P>As beans delight in a most soil, and have no
end of growing in a moist season, they cover the
ground totally when sown broadcast, keep in the
dew, and exclude the sun and air: the plants
grow to a great height, but carry little seed, and
that little not well ripened. This displays the ad∣vantage
of drilling, which gives free access to
the sun and air, dries the ground, and affords
plenty of ripe seed.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<PB N="98" REF="124"/>
<HEAD>5. PEASE.</HEAD>
<P>PEASE are of two kinds; the white, and the
gray. The latter is what generally is cultivated
in Scotland for fruit; and the latter only shall be
here handled, leaving the former to gardeners.</P>
<P>There are two species of the gray kind, distin∣guished
by their time of ripening. One ripens
soon, and for that reason is termed <HI>hot seed:</HI> the
other, which is slower in ripening, is termed <HI>cold
seed.</HI> Whether these be really different species,
or be accidentally different only, is left to natural
philosophers.</P>
<P>Pease, a leguminous crop, is proper to inter∣vene
between two culmiferous crops; less for the
profit of a pease-crop, than for meliorating the
ground. Pease however in a dry season will pro∣duce
six or seven bolls each acre; but in an ordi∣nary
season they seldom reach above two or two
and a half. This leads me to think, that in a
moist climate, which all the west of Britain is, red
clover is a more beneficial crop than pease; as it
makes as good winter-food as pease, and can be
cut green thrice during summer. When hus∣bandry
comes to be better understood, I have
little doubt but that red clover will banish pease
altogether, except in the warmest and driest spots.</P>
<P>A field intended sor cold seed ought to be
ploughed in October or November; and in Fe∣bruary,
<PB N="99" REF="125"/>
as soon as the ground is dry, the seed
ought to be sown on the winter-furrow. A field
intended for hot seed, ought to be ploughed in
March or April, immediately before sowing. But
if infested with weeds, it ought to be also plough∣ed
in October or November.</P>
<P>Pease laid a foot below the surface will vege∣tate:
but the most approved depth is six inches
in light soil, and four inches in clay soil; for
which reason, they ought to be sown under furrow
when the ploughing is delayed till spring. Of all
grain, beans excepted, they are the least in dan∣ger
of being buried.</P>
<P>Pease differ from beans, in loving a dry soil
and a dry season. Horse-hoeing would be a
great benefit, could it be performed to any ad∣vantage;
but pease grow expeditiously, and soon
fall over and cover the ground, which bars
ploughing. Horse-hoeing has little effect when
the plants are new sprung; and when they are
advanced to be benefited by that culture, their
length prevents it. Fast growing at the same
time is the cause of their carrying so little seed:
the seed is buried among the leaves; and the sun
cannot penetrate to make it grow and ripen. The
only practicable remedy to obtain grain, is thin
sowing; but thick sowing produces more straw,
and mellows the ground more. Half a boll for an
English acre may be reckoned thin sowing; three
firlots, thick sowing.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding what is said above, Mr Hun∣ter,
<PB N="100" REF="126"/>
a noted farmer in Berwickshire, has begun
of late to sow all his pease in drills; and he never
fails to have great crops of corn as well as of
straw. He sows double rows at a foot interval,
and two feet and a half between the double rows,
which admit horse-hoeing. By that method, he
has also good crops of beans on light land.</P>
<P>Pease and beans mixed are often sown toge∣ther,
in order to catch different seasons. In a
moist season, the beans make a good crop; in a
dry season, the pease.</P>
<P>The growth of plants is commonly checked by
drought in the month of July; but promoted by
rain in August. In July, grass is parched; in Au∣gust,
it recovers verdure. Where pease are so far
advanced in the dry season as that the seed be∣gins
to form, their growth is indeed checked,
but the seed continues to fill. If only in the
blossom at that season, their growth is checked a
little; but they become vigorous again in August,
and continue growing without filling till stopped
by frost. Hence it is, that cold seed, which is
early sown, has the best chance to produce corn:
hot seed, which is late sown, has the best chance
to produce straw.</P>
<P>The following method is practised in Norfolk,
for sowing pease upon a dry light soil, immediately
opened from pasture. The ground is pared with
a plough extremely thin, and every sod is laid ex∣actly
on its back. In every sod a double row of
holes is made. A pea dropt in every hole lodges
<PB N="101" REF="127"/>
in the flay'd ground immediately below the sod,
thrusts its roots horizontally, and has sufficient
moisture. This method enabled Norfolk farmers,
in the baren year 1740, to furnish white pease to
us at 12 s. per boll.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PLANTS CULTIVATED FOR ROOTS.</HEAD>
<P>PLANTS of that kind commonly cultivated in
the field, are turnip, potatoes, carrot,
parsnip.</P>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>1. TURNIP.</HEAD>
<P>IT animates me to have opportunity for gi∣ving
directions about a crop, that the best farmers
in this country have now taken into their plan of
husbandry; and that does not altogether escape
even small farmers. Nor am I acquainted with
a single instance in Scotland, where turnip fairly
begun have been relinquished.</P>
<P>The proper soil for turnip is a gravelly soil; and
there it can be raised to the greatest perfection,
and with the least hazard of miscarrying. At the
same time, there is no soil but will bear turnip
when well prepared.</P>
<P>No person ever deserved better of a country,
than he who first cultivated turnip in the field.
<PB N="102" REF="128"/>
No plant is better fitted for the climate of Britain,
no plant prospers better in the coldest part of it,
and no plant contributes more to fertility. In a
word, there has not for two centuries been intro∣duced
into Britain a more valuable improvement.</P>
<P>Of all roots, turnip requires the finest mould;
and to that end, of all harrows frost is the best. In
order to give access to frost, the land ought to be
prepared by ribbing after harvest, as above di∣rected
in preparing land for barley. If the field
be not subject to annuals, it may lie in that state
till the end of May; otherwise the weeds must be
destroyed by a brakeing about the middle of A∣pril;
and again in May, if weeds rise. The first
week of June, plough the field with a shallow
furrow. Lime it if requisite, and harrow the lime
into the soil. Draw single furrows with intervals
of three feet, and lay dung in the furrows. Co∣ver
the dung sufficiently, by going round it with
the plough, and forming the three feet spaces in∣to
ridges. The dung comes thus to lie below the
crown of every ridge.</P>
<P>The season of sowing must be regulated by the
time intended for feeding. Where intended for
feeding in November, December, January, and
February, the seed ought to be sown from the 1st
to the 20th of June. Where the feeding is in∣tended
to be carried on to March, April, and
May, the seed must not be sown till the end of
July. Turnip sown earlier than above directed,
<PB N="103" REF="129"/>
flowers that very summer, and runs fast to seed;
which renders it in a good measure unfit for food.
If sown much later, it does not apple, and there
is no food but from the leaves.</P>
<P>Though by a drill-plough the seed may be sown
of any thickness, the safest way is to sow thick.
Thin-sowing is liable to many accidents, which
are far from being counterbalanced by the ex∣pence
that is saved in thinning. Thick-sowing
can bear the ravage of the black fly, and leave a
sufficient crop behind. It is a protection against
drought, gives the plants a rapid progress, and
establishes them in the ground before it is neces∣sary
to thin them.</P>
<P>The sowing turnip broadcast is universal in
England, and common in Scotland, though a
barbarous practice. The eminent advantage of
turnip is, that, beside a profitable crop, it makes
a most complete fallow; and the latter cannot be
obtained but by horse-hoeing. Upon that ac∣count,
I recommend with confidence the sowing
turnip in rows at three feet distance: wider rows
answer no profitable end, straiter rows afford not
room for a horse to walk in. When the turnip
is about four inches high, annual weeds will ap∣pear.
Go round every interval with the slightest
furrow possible, at the distance of two inches
from each row, moving the earth from the
rows toward the middle of the interval. A thin
plate of iron must be fixed on the left side of the
<PB N="104" REF="130"/>
plough, to prevent the earth from falling back,
and burying the turnip. Next, let women be em∣ployed
to weed the rows with their fingers; which
is better, and cheaper done, than with the hand-hoe.
The hand-hoe, beside, is apt to disturb the
roots of the turnip that are to stand, and to leave
them open to drought by removing the earth from
them. The standing turnip are to be at the di∣stance
of twelve inches from each other: a great∣er
distance makes them swell too much; a less di∣stance
affords them not sufficient room. A wo∣man
soon comes to be expert in finger-weeding.
The following hint may be necessary to a learner.
To secure the turnip that is to stand, let her cover
it with the left hand; and with the right pull up
the turnip on both sides. After thus freeing the
standing turnip, she may safely use both hands.
Let the field remain in this state, till the appear∣ance
of new annuals make a second ploughing
necessary; which must be in the same furrow with
the former, but a little deeper. As in this plough∣ing
the iron plate is to be removed, part of the
loose earth will fall back on the roots of the plants:
the rest will fill the middle of the interval, and
bury every weed. When weeds begin again to
appear, then is the time for a third ploughing in
an opposite direction, which lays the earth to the
roots of the plants. This ploughing may be a∣bout
the middle of August, after which, weeds
rise very faintly. If they do rise, another plough∣ing
<PB N="105" REF="131"/>
will clear the ground of them. Weeds that
at this time rise in the row, may be cleared with
a hand-hoe, which can do little mischief among
plants distant twelve inches from each other. I
am certain however from experience, that it may
be done cheaper with the hand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Children under thirteen may be employed to weed turnip with the fingers. I have seen them go on in that work with alacrity; and a small premium will have a good effect. Custom, a second nature, will lead them to think, that weeding turnip is no less necessary than sow∣ing them. For boys and girls above thirteen, a hand-hoe adapted to their size is an excellent instrument: i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> strengthens the arms amazingly. In driving the plough, the legs only are exercised; but as the arms are chiefly employed in husbandry, they ought to be prepared be∣forehand by gentle exercise.</NOTE>. And after the
leaves of turnips in a row meet together, the
hand is the only instrument that can be applied
for weeding.</P>
<P>Tull was the father of horse-hoeing husbandry;
and to desert his method requires an apology.
The apology I make is, that the method I pre∣scribe
and have long practised, is more simple,
less operose, and, as far as I can judge, equally
successful. Our farmers ought to be excited by
every art to embrace the cultivation of turnip:
and nothing will contribute more than to render
it easy and simple. Tull's method is not a little
intricate; and to its intricacy, I am persuaded, is
owing the neglect of it in England.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="132"/>
In swampy ground, the surface of which is best
reduced by paring and burning, the seed may
be sown in rows with intervals of a foot. To save
time, a drill-plough may be used that sows three
or four rows at once. Hand-hoeing is proper for
such ground; because the soil under the burnt
<HI>stratum</HI> is commonly full of roots, which digest
and rot better under ground than when brought
to the surface by the plough. In the mean time,
while these are digesting, the ashes will secure a
good crop.</P>
<P>The black fly is a great enemy to turnip; and I
may justly say the only enemy, because every o∣ther
article can be secured, by skill and diligence
in the husbandman. In a rich and warm soil,
where the black fly is instinctively directed to de∣posit
its eggs, I take it to be an unconquerable
enemy. Our only security is, to change the field
of battle, by raising turnip in a moorish ground,
or in ground newly broken up, according to the
directions given above<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 3. § 2.</NOTE>.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>2. POTATOES.</HEAD>
<P>THE choice of soil is not of greater importance
in any other plant than in a potato. This plant
in clay soil, or in rank black loam lying low with∣out
ventilation, never makes palatable food. In
<PB N="107" REF="133"/>
a gravelly or sandy soil, exposed to the sun and
to free air, it thrives to perfection, and has a good
relish. But a rank black loam, though improper
to raise potatoes for the table, produces them in
great plenty; and the product is good and whole∣some
food for horned cattle, hogs, and poultry.</P>
<P>The spade is a proper instrument for raising a
small quantity, or for preparing corners or other
places inaccessible to the plough; but for raising
potatoes in quantities, the plough is the only in∣strument.</P>
<P>As two great advantages of a drilled crop, are, to
destroy weeds, and to have a fallow at the same
time with the crop, no judicious farmer will think
of raising potatoes in any other way. In Septem∣ber
or October, as soon as that year's crop is remo∣ved,
let the field have a rousing furrow, a cross∣brakeing
next, and then cleared of weeds by the
cleaning harrow. Form it into three-feet ridges, in
that state to lie till April, which is the proper time
for planting potatoes. Cross-brake it to raise the
furrows a little. Then lay well-digested horse-dung
along the furrows, upon which lay the roots at
eight inches distance. Cover up these roots with
the plough, going once round every row. This
makes a warm bed for the potatoes; hot dung
below, and a loose covering above, that admits e∣very
ray of the sun. As soon as the plants ap∣pear
above ground, go round every row a second
time with the plough, which will lay upon the
<PB N="108" REF="134"/>
plants an additional inch or two of mould, and at
the same time bury all the annuals; and this will
complete the ploughing of the ridges. When
the potatoes are six inches high, the plough, with
the deepest furrow, must go twice along the
middle of each interval in opposite directions, lay∣ing
earth first to one row, and next to the other.
And to perform this work, a plough with a
double mould-board will be more expeditious.
But as the earth cannot be laid close to the roots
by the plough, the spade must succeed, with
which four inches of the plants must be covered,
leaving little more but the tops above ground;
and this operation will at the same time bury all
the weeds that have sprung since the former
ploughing. What weeds arise after, must be pull∣ed
up with the hand. A hoe is never to be used
here: it cannot go so deep as to destroy the weeds
without cutting the fibres of the plants; and if it
skim the surface, it only cuts off the heads of the
weeds, and does not prevent their pushing again.</P>
<P>The shortest and most perfect method of ta∣king
up potatoes, is to plough once round every
row at the distance of four inches, removing the
earth from the plants, and gathering up with the
hand all the potatoes that appear. The distance
is made four inches to prevent cutting the roots,
which are seldom found above that distance from
the row on each side. When the ground is thus
cleared by the plough, raise the potatoes with a
<PB N="109" REF="135"/>
fork having three broad toes or claws, which is
better than a spade, as it does not cut the pota∣toes.
The potatoes thus laid above ground, must
be gathered with the hand. By this method
scarce a potato will be left.</P>
<P>As potatoes are a comfortable food for the low
people, it is of importance to have them all the
year round. For a long time, potatoes in Scot∣land
were confined to the kitchen-garden; and
after they were planted in the field, it was not
imagined at first that they could be used after the
month of December. Of late years they have
been found to answer even till April; which has
proved a great support to many a poor family, as
they are easily cooked, and require neither kiln
nor mill. But there is no cause for stopping
there. It is easy to preserve them till the next
crop: When taken out of the ground, lay in the
corner of a barn a quantity that may serve till
April, covered from frost with dry straw pressed
down: bury the remainder in a hole dug in dry
ground, mixed with the husks of dried oats,
sand, or the dry leaves of trees, over which build
a stack of hay or corn. When the pit is opened
for taking out the potatoes, the eyes of what
have a tendency to push, must be cut out; and
this cargo will serve all the month of June. To
be still more certain of making the old crop meet
the new, the setting of a small quantity may
be delayed till June, to be taken up at the ordi∣nary
<PB N="110" REF="136"/>
time before frost. This cargo, having not
arrived to full growth, will not be so ready to
push as what are set in April.</P>
<P>If the crop happen to be exhausted before the
new crop is ready, the interval may be supplied
by the potatoes of the new crop that lie next the
surface, to be picked up with the hand; which,
far from hurting the crop, will rather improve it.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>3. CARROT and PARSNIP.</HEAD>
<P>OF all roots a carrot requires the deepest soil.
It ought at least to be a foot deep, all equally good
from top to bottom. If such a soil be not in the
farm, it may be made artificially by trench∣ploughing,
which brings to the surface what ne∣ver
had any communication with the sun or air.
When this new soil is sufficiently improved by a
crop or two with dung, it is fit for bearing car∣rots.
Beware of dunging the year when the car∣rots
are sown; for with fresh dung they seldom
escape rotten scabs.</P>
<P>The only soils proper for that root, are a loam
and a sandy soil.</P>
<P>The ground must be prepared by the deepest
furrow that can be taken, the sooner after harvest
the better; immediately upon the back of which
a ribbing ought to succeed as directed for barley.
At the end of March or beginning of April,
which is the time of sowing the seed, the ground
<PB N="111" REF="137"/>
must be smoothed with a brake. Sow the seed in
drills, with intervals of a foot for hand-hoeing;
which is no expensive operation where the crop is
confined to an acre or two: but if the quantity
of ground be greater, the intervals ought to be
three feet, in order for horse-hoeing.</P>
<P>In flat ground without ridges, it may be pro∣per
to make parallel furrows with the plough, ten
feet from each other, in order to carry off any
redundant moisture.</P>
<P>At Parlington in Yorkshire, from the end of
September to the first of May, twenty work-horses,
four bullocks, and six milk-cows, were
fed on the carrots that grew on three acres; and
these animals never tasted any other food but a
little hay. The milk was excellent: and, over
and above, thirty hogs were fattened upon what
was left by the other beasts. I have this fact
from undoubted authority.</P>
<P>The culture of parsnips is the same with that
of carrots.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">PLANTS CULTIVATED FOR LEAVES.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are many garden-plants of this kind,
The plants proper for the field are cab∣bage,
red and white, colewort, plain and curled.
I know very little difference in the cultivation of
<PB N="112" REF="138"/>
these plants. And therefore, to save trouble, I
shall confine myself to cabbage. The reader will
easily apply to the other plants the directions to be
given concerning cabbage.</P>
<P>Cabbage is an interesting article in husbandry,
every soil being more or less proper for it. It is
easily raised, is subject to few diseases, resists frost
more than turnip, is palatable to cattle, and soon∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them than turnip, carrot, or potatoes.</P>
<P>The season for setting cabbage, depends on the
use it is intended for. If intended for feeding in
November, December, and January, plants pro∣cured
from seed sown the end of July the preceding
year, must be set in March or April. If intended
for feeding in March, April, and May, the plants
must be set the first week of the preceding July,
from seed sown end of February or beginning
of March the same year. The late setting of the
plants retards their growth; by which means they
have a vigorous growth the following spring.
And this crop makes an important link in the
chain that connects winter and summer green
food. Let me observe by the by, that where
cabbage for spring-food happens to be neglected,
a few acres of rye sown at Michaelmas will supply
the want. After the rye is consumed, there is
time sufficient to prepare the ground for turnip.</P>
<P>And now to prepare a field for cabbage.
Where the plants are to be set in March, the field
must be made up after harvest, in ridges three
<PB N="113" REF="139"/>
feet wide. In that form let it lie all winter, to be
mellowed with air and frost. In March, take the
first opportunity, between wet and dry, to lay
dung in the furrows. Cover the dung with a
plough, which will convert the furrow into a
crown, and consequently the crown into a furrow.
Set the plants upon the dung, distant from each
other three feet. Plant them so as to make a
straight line cross the ridges, as well as along the
furrows, to which a gardener's line stretched per∣pendicularly
cross the furrows will be requisite.
This will set each plant at the distance precisely of
three feet from the plants that furround it. The
purpose of this accuracy, is to give opportunity
for ploughing, not only along the ridges, but cross
them. This mode is attended with three signal
advantages: it saves hand-hoeing, it is a more
complete dressing to the soil, and it lays earth neat∣ly
round every plant.</P>
<P>If the soil be deep and composed of good earth,
a trench-ploughing after the preceding crop will
not be amiss; in which case, the time for divi∣ding
the field into three-feet ridges as above,
ought to be immediately before the dunging for
the plants.</P>
<P>If weeds happen to rise so close to the plants
as not to be reached by the plough, it will require
very little labour to destroy them with a hand-hoe.</P>
<P>Unless the soil be much infested with annuals,
twice ploughing after the plants are set will be a
<PB N="114" REF="140"/>
sufficient dressing. The first removes the earth
from the plants; the next, at the distance of a
month or so, lays it back.</P>
<P>Where the plants are to be set in July, the field
must be ribbed as directed for barley. It ought
to have a slight ploughing in June before the
planting, in order to loosen the soil, but not so as
to bury the surface-earth; after which the three∣feet
ridges must be formed, and the other parti∣culars
carried on as directed above with respect to
plants that are to be set in March.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">CULTURE OF GRASS.</HEAD>
<P>THE grasses commonly sown for pasture, for
hay, or to cut green for cattle, are red
clover, white clover, yellow clover, ryegrass, and
narrow-leaved plantain, commonly called <HI>ribwort.</HI>
Among the great variety of grasses, there is little
doubt, but that some new sorts may be introdu∣ced
to advantage. But without meaning to shut
out light, I am certain that the grasses mentioned
answer completely all useful purposes of hus∣bandry.</P>
<P>Red clover is of all the most proper to be cut
green for summer-food. It is a biennial plant
when suffered to perfect its seed; but when cut
<PB N="115" REF="141"/>
green, it will last three years, and in a dry soil
longer. At the same time the safest course is to
let it stand but a single year: if the second year's
crop happen to be scanty, it proves, like a bad
crop of pease, a great encourager of weeds by the
shelter it affords them. Sainfoin and lucern make
excellent green food; and, when preserved clean
from weeds, they will stand good ten or twelve
years, especially in a deep gravel. There they
extend their roots very deep, and will grow vigo∣rously
in a dry summer, when other plants of
shorter roots languish by lack of moisture. But
except in such a soil, I venture to declare in fa∣vour
of red clover; and my reason is, that the
expence of sowing it yearly is much less than that
of hand-hoeing sainfoin and lucern frequently e∣very
year. Sainfoin indeed seems to be the har∣dier
plant. Farmers about Bath sow it in their
highest unsheltered grounds; and it endures frost
better than clover, or any sort of grain. Like
clover it is sown with barley; and as much seed
is given as of barley. It is commonly cut but
once the first year; and the first winter, coal∣ashes
are spread upon it.</P>
<P>Here, as in all other crops, the goodness of
red-clover seed is of importance. Chuse plump
seed of a purple colour, because it takes on that
colour when ripe. It is red when hurt in the
drying, and of a faint colour when unripe.</P>
<P>Red clover is luxuriant upon a rich soil, whe∣ther
<PB N="116" REF="142"/>
clay, loam, or gravel: it will grow even up∣on
a moor when properly cultivated. A wet soil
is its only bane; for there it does not thrive.</P>
<P>To have red clover in perfection, weeds must
be extirpated, and stones taken off. The mould
ought to be made as fine as harrowing can make
it; and the surface be smoothed with a light rol∣ler,
if not sufficently smooth without it. This
gives opportunity for distributing the seed evenly;
which must be covered by a small harrow with
teeth no larger than of a garden-rake, three inches
long, and six inches asunder; of which there is
a draught annexed. In harrowing, the man
should walk behind with a rope in his hand fixed
to the back part of the harrow, ready to disen∣tangle
it from stones, clods, turnip or cabbage
roots, which would trail the feed, and displace it.</P>
<P>Nature has not determined any precise depth
for the seed of red clover more than of other seed.
It will grow vigorously from two inches deep,
and it will grow when barely covered. Half an inch
I reckon the most advantageous position in clay
soil, a whole inch in what is light or loose. It is
a vulgar error, that small seed ought to be spa∣ringly
covered. Missed by that error, farmers
commonly cover their clover-seed with a bushy
branch of thorn; which not only covers it une∣qually,
but leaves part on the surface to wither in
the air.</P>
<P>The proper season for sowing red clover, is from
<PB N="117" REF="143"/>
the middle of April to the middle of May. It will
spring from the 1st of March to the end of Au∣gust;
but such liberty ought not to be taken ex∣cept
from necessity.</P>
<P>The ordinary manner of sowing, is to hold the
seed between the thumb and the two fore fingers.
I prefer another manner; which is, to take into the
hollow of the hand as much as will serve in walk∣ing
three or four steps; and to join the fingers to
the palm so loosely, as to make many small holes
for throwing out the seed. A hand closed so loose∣ly,
resembles the rose of a watering pan, which
scatters the water through a number of small
holes.</P>
<P>There cannot be a greater blunder in husband∣ry,
than to be sparing of seed. Ideal writers talk
of sowing an acre with four pounds. That
quantity of seed, say they, will fill an acre with
plants as thick as they ought to stand. I admit
this rule to be good where grain is the object;
but it will not answer with respect to grass. Grass∣seed
cannot be sown too thick: the plants shelter
one another: they retain all the dew: and they
must push upward, having no room laterally.
Observe the place where a sack of pease, or of o∣ther
grain, has been set down for sowing: the
seed dropt there accidentally grows more quickly
than in the rest of the field sown thin out of hand:
I have seen it six inches high, when the rest of
the seed scarce appeared above ground. A young
<PB N="118" REF="144"/>
plant of clover, or of sainfoin, according to Tull,
may be raised to a great size where it has room;
but the field will not produce half the quantity.
When red clover is sown for cutting green, there
ought not to be less than twenty-four pounds to
an acre. A field of clover is seldom too thick:
the smaller a stem be, the more acceptable it is to
cattle. It is often too thin, and when so, the
stems tend to wood.</P>
<P>Red clover is commonly sown with grain; and
the doubt may be, what grain is the most proper.
I pronounce in favour of flax; and I pronounce
with confidence from multiplied experience. The
soil must be highly cultivated for flax as well as
for red clover. The proper season of sowing is the
same for both: the leaves of flax being very
small, admit of free circulation of air; and flax
being an early crop, is removed so early as to give
the clover time for growing. In a rich soil it has
grown so fast, as to afford a good cutting that
very year. Next to flax, barley is the best com∣panion
to clover. The soil must be loose and free
for barley; and so it ought to be for clover: the
season of sowing is the same; and the clover is
well established in the ground, before it is over∣topped
by the barley. At the same time, barley
commonly is sooner cut than either oats or wheat.
In a word, barley is rather a nurse than a stepmo∣ther
to clover during its infancy. When clover
is sown in spring upon wheat, the soil, which has
<PB N="119" REF="145"/>
lain five or six months without being stirred, is an
improper bed for it; and the wheat, being in the
vigour of growth, overtops it from the begin∣ning.
It cannot be sown along with oats, because
of the hazard of frost; and when sown as usual
among oats three inches high, it is overtopped,
and never enjoys free air till the oats be cut.
Add, that where oats are sown upon the winter-furrow,
the soil is rendered as hard as when under
wheat. Red clover is sometimes sown by itself,
without other grain; but this method, beside lo∣sing
a crop, is not salutary; because clover in its
infant state requires shelter. This very year 1775
has confirmed all my experiments about clover.
In part of a field, flax was sown with it; in an∣other
part, barley; and, in the remainder, it was
sown alone. The clover on the first was the best;
on the second, inferior; and, on the third, the
worst. Yet the barley was sown thin, as it ought
to be with grass-seeds, and was but an indifferent
crop.</P>
<P>And this leads to the quantity of grain proper
to be sown with clover. In a rich soil well pul∣verized,
a peck of barley on an English acre is all
that ought to be ventured; but there is not much
soil in Scotland so rich. Two Linlithgow sirlots
make the proper quantity for an acre that produces
commonly six bolls of barley; half a firlot for what
produces nine bolls. To those who are govern∣ed
by custom, so small a quantity will be thought
<PB N="120" REF="146"/>
ridiculous. Let them only consider, that a rich
soil in perfect good order, will from a single seed
of barley produce twenty or thirty vigorous stems.
People may flatter themselves with the remedy, of
cutting barley green for food, if it happen to op∣press
the clover. This is an excellent remedy in
a field of an acre or two; but the cutting an ex∣tensive
field for food must be flow; and while one
part is cutting, the clover is smothered in other
parts.</P>
<P>The culture of white clover, of yellow clover,
of ribwort, of ryegrass, is the same in general
with that of red clover. I proceed to their pecu∣liarities.
Yellow clover, ribwort, ryegrass, are
all of them early plants, blooming the end of A∣pril
or beginning of May. The two latter are
evergreens, and therefore excellent for winter-pasture.
Ryegrass is less hurt by frost than any
of the clovers, and will thrive in a moister soil:
nor in that soil is it much affected by drought. In
a rich soil, it grows four feet high: even in the
dry summer 1775, it rose to three feet eight
inches; but it had gained that height before the
drought came on. These grasses are generally
sown with red clover for producing a plentiful
crop. The proportion of seed is arbitrary; and
there is little danger of too much. When ryegrass
is sown for procuring seed, five sirlots wheat-mea∣sure
may be sown on an acre; and for procuring
seed of ribwort, forty pounds may be sown. The
<PB N="121" REF="147"/>
roots of ryegrass spread horizontally: they bind
the soil by their number; and though small, are
yet so vigorous as to thrive in hard soil. Red
clover has a large tap-root, which cannot pene∣trate
any soil but what is open and free; and the
largeness of the root makes the soil still more open
and free. Ryegrass, once a great favourite, ap∣pears
to be discarded in most parts of Britain.
But were the management of it well understood,
it would be restored to high favour. The com∣mon
practice has been, to sow it with red clover,
and to cut them promiscuously the beginning of
June for green food, and a little later for hay.
This indeed is the proper season for cutting red
clover, because at that time it begins to flower; but
as at that time the seed of the ryegress is approach∣ing
to maturity, its growth is stopped for that
year, as much as of oats or barley cut after the
seed is ripe. Oats or barley cut green before the
seed forms, will afford two other cuttings; which
is the case ef ryegrass, of yellow clover, and of
ribwort. By such management, all the profit will
be drawn that these plants can afford.</P>
<P>When red clover is intended for seed, the
ground ought to be cleared of weeds, were it for
no other purpose than that the seed cannot other∣wise
be preserved pure: what weeds escape the
plough, ought to be taken out by the hand. In
England, when a crop of seed is intended, the
clover is always first cut for hay. This I conjec∣ture
<PB N="122" REF="148"/>
to be done, as in fruit-trees, to check the
growth of the wood, in order to encourage the
fruit. This practice will not answer with us, as
the seed would often be too late for ripening. It
would do better to eat the clover with sheep till
the middle of May, which would allow the seed
to ripen. The seed is ripe when, upon rubbing
it between the hands, it parts readily from the
husk. Then apply the sythe, spread the crop thin,
and turn it carefully. When perfectly dry, take
the first opportunity of a hot day for threshing it
on boards covered with a coarse sheet. Another
way less subject to risk, is to stack the dry hay,
and to thresh it the end of April. After the first
threshing, expose the husks to the sun, and thresh
them over and over till no seed remain. Nothing
is more efficacious than a hot sun to make the
husk part with its seed; in which view it may be
exposed to the sun by parcels, an hour or two be∣fore
the flail is applied.</P>
<P>White clover intended for seed, is managed in
the same manner. No plant ought to be mixed
with ryegrass that is intended for seed. In Scot∣land,
much ryegrass-seed is hurt by transgressing
that rule. The seed is ripe when it parts easily
from the husk. The yellowness of the stem is an∣other
indication of its ripeness; in which particu∣lar
it resembles oats, barley, and other culmiferous
plants. The best manner to manage a crop of
ryegrass for seed, is to bind it loosely in small
<PB N="123" REF="149"/>
sheaves, widening them at the bottom to make
them stand erect; as is done with oats in moist
weather. In that state they may stand till suf∣ficiently
dry for threshing. By this method they
dry more quickly, and are less hurt by rain, than
by close binding and putting the sheaves in shocks
like corn. The worst way of all, is, to spread
the ryegrass on the moist ground; for it makes
the seed malten. The sheaves, when sufficiently
dry, are carried in close carts to where they are
to be threshed on a board, as mentioned above
for clover. Put the straw in a rick, when a hun∣dred
stone or so are threshed. Carry the thresh∣ing-board
to the place where another rick is in∣tended;
and so on till the whole seed be threshed,
and the straw ricked. There is necessity for close
carts to save the seed, which is apt to drop out in
a hot sun: and, as observed above, a hot sun
ought always to be chosen for threshing. Carry
the seed in sacks to the granary or barn, there
to be separated from the husks by a fanner.
Spread the seed thin upon a timber floor, and
turn it once or twice a day, till perfectly dry. If
suffered to take a heat, it is useless for seed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ROTATION OF CROPS.</HEAD>
<P>NO branch of husbandry requires more skill
and sagacity than a proper rotation of
crops, so as to keep the ground always in heart,
and yet to draw out of it the greatest profit pos∣sible.
A horse is purchased for labour; and it is
the purchaser's intention to make the most of him.
He is well fed, and wrought according to his
strength: to overwork him, is to render him
useless. Precisely similar is land. Profit is the
farmer's object; but he knows, that to run out
his farm by indiscreet cropping, is not the way to
make profit. Some plants rob the soil, others are
gentle to it: some bind, others loosen. The nice
point is, to intermix crops, so as to make the great∣est
profit consistently with keeping the ground in
trim. In that view, the nature of the plants em∣ployed
in husbandry, must be accurately exami∣ned.</P>
<P>The difference between culmiferous and legu∣minous
plants, is occasionally mentioned above<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 5.</NOTE>.
With respect to the present subject, a closer in∣spection
is necessary. Culmiferous plants, having
small leaves and few in number, depend mostly
<PB N="125" REF="151"/>
on the soil for nourishment, and little on the air.
During the ripening of the seed, they draw pro∣bably
their whole nourishment from the soil; as
the leaves by this time, being dry and withered,
must have lost their power of drawing nourish∣ment
from the air. Now, as culmiferous plants
are chiefly cultivated for their seed, and are not
cut down till the seed be fully ripe, they may be
pronounced all of them to be robbers, some more
some less. But such plants, while young, are all
leaves; and in that state draw most of their nou∣rishment
from the air. Hence it is, that where
cut green for food to cattle, a culmiferous crop
is far from being a robber. A hay-crop accor∣dingly,
even where it consists mostly of ryegrass,
is not a robber, provided it be cut before the seed
is formed; which at any rate it ought to be, if
one would have hay in perfection. And the fog∣gage,
excluding frost by covering the ground,
keeps the roots warm. A leguminous plant, by
its broad leaves, draws much of its nourishment
from the air. A cabbage, which has very broad
leaves, and a multitude of them, owes its growth
more to the air than to the soil. One fact is cer∣tain,
that a cabbage cut and hung up in a damp
place, preserves its verdure longer than other
plants. At the same time, a seed is that part of a
plant which requires the most nourishment; and for
that nourishment a culmiferous plant must be in∣debted
entirely to the soil. A leguminous crop,
<PB N="126" REF="152"/>
on the contrary, when cut green for food, must
be very gentle to the ground. Pease and beans
are leguminous plants; but being cultivated for
seed, they seem to occupy a middle station: their
seed makes them more severe than other legumi∣nous
crops cut green: their leaves, which grow till
reaping, make them less severe than a culmife∣rous
plant left to ripen.</P>
<P>These plants are distinguished no less remark∣ably
by the following circumstance. All the seeds
of a culmiferous plant ripen at the same time. As
soon as they begin to form, the plant becomes
stationary, the leaves wither, the roots cease to
push, and the plant, when cut down, is blanched
and sapless. The seeds of a leguminous plant
are formed successively: flowers and fruit appear
at the same time in different parts of the plant.
This plant accordingly is continually growing, and
pushing its roots. Hence the value of bean or
pease straw above that of wheat or oats: the lat∣ter
is withered and dry when the crop is cut; the
former, green and succulent. The difference
therefore with respect to the soil between a cul∣miferous
and leguminous crop, is great. The
latter, growing till cut down, keeps the ground
in constant motion, and leaves it to the plough
loose and mellow. The former gives over grow∣ing
long before reaping, and the ground, by want
of motion, turns compact and hard. Nor is this
all. Dew falling on a culmiferous crop after the
<PB N="127" REF="153"/>
ground begins to harden, rests on the surface, and
is sucked up by the next sun. Dew that falls on
a leguminous crop, is shaded from the sun by
the broad leaves, and sinks at leisure into the
ground. The ground accordingly after a culmi∣ferous
crop, is not only hard but dry: after a le∣guminous
crop, it is not only loose, but soft and
unctuous.</P>
<P>Of all culmiferous plants, wheat is the most se∣vere,
by the long time it occupies the ground
without admitting a plough. And as the grain is
heavier than that of barley or oats, it probably
requires more nourishment than either. Spring-wheat
is creeping into use: if it succeed, it will
probably be not much more severe than other cul∣miferous
plants. It is observed above, that as
pease and beans draw part of their nourishment
from the air by their green leaves while allowed
to stand, they draw the less from the ground;
and by their constant growing they leave it in good
condition for subsequent crops. In both respects
they are preferable to any culmiferous crop.</P>
<P>Culmiferous crops, as observed above, are not
robbers when cut green: the soil, far from har∣dening,
is kept in constant motion by the push∣ing
of the roots, and is left more tender than if
it had been left at rest without bearing any crop.</P>
<P>Bulbous-rooted plants are above all successful in
dividing and pulverising the soil. Potato-roots grow
six, eight, or ten, inches under the surface; and, by
<PB N="128" REF="154"/>
their size and number, they divide and pulverize
the soil better than can be done by the plough;
consequently, whatever be the natural colour of
the soil, it is black when a potato-crop is taken
up. The potato, however, with respect to its
quality of dividing the soil, must yield to a carrot
or parsnip; which are large roots, and pierce oft∣en
to the depth of eighteen inches. The turnip,
by its tap-root, divides the soil more than can be
done by a fibrous-rooted plant; but as its bulbous
root grows mostly above ground, it divides the
soil less than the potato, the carrot, or the pars∣nip.
Red clover, in that respect, may be put in
the same class with turnip.</P>
<P>Whether potatoes or turnip be the more gentle
crop, appears a puzzling question. The former
bears seed, and probably draws more nourish∣ment
from the soil than the latter, when cut green.
On the other hand, potatoes divide the soil more
than turnip, and leave it more loose and friable.
It appears no less puzzling, to determine between
cabbage and turnip: the former draws more of
its nourishment from the air, the latter leaves the
soil more free and open.</P>
<P>Here are a number of facts: What is the re∣sult
of the whole? Clearly what follows. Culmi∣ferous
plants are robbers; some more, some less:
they at the same time bind the soil; some more,
some less. Leguminous plants in both respects
are opposite: if any of them rob the soil, it is in
<PB N="129" REF="155"/>
a very slight degree; and all of them without ex∣ception
loosen the soil. A culmiferous crop, how∣ever,
is generally the more profitable: but few
soils can long bear the burden of such crops, un∣less
relieved by interjected leguminous crops.
These, on the other hand, without a mixture of
culmiferous crops, would soon render the soil too
loose.</P>
<P>These preliminaries will carry the farmer some
length in directing a proper rotation of crops.
Where dung, lime, or other manure, can be pro∣cured
in plenty to recruit the soil after severe
cropping, I know no rotation more proper or pro∣fitable
in a strong soil, than wheat, pease or
beans, barley, oats, fallow. The whole farm
may be brought under this rotation, except so
sar as hay is wanted. But as such command of
manure is rare, it is of more importance to deter∣mine
what should be the rotation, where no ma∣nure
can be procured but the dung collected in
the farm. Considering that culmiferous crops are
the more profitable in rich land, it would be pro∣per
to make them more frequent than the other
kind. But as there are few soils in Scotland that
will admit such frequent culmiferous crops with∣out
suffering, it may be laid down as a general
rule, that alternate crops, culmiferous and legu∣minous,
ought to form the rotation. Nor are
there many soils that will stand good, even with
this favourable rotation, unless relieved from time
<PB N="130" REF="156"/>
to time by pasturing a few years. If such extended
rotation be artfully carried on, I take it for grant∣ed,
that crops without end may be obtained in a
tolerable good soil, without any manure but what
is produced in the farm.</P>
<P>Having discussed the nature of plants, as far as
rotation of crops is concerned, the nature of the soil
comes next under consideration. It is scarce ne∣cessary
to be mentioned, being known to every
farmer, that clay answers best for wheat, moist clay
for beans, loam for barley and pease, light soil for
turnip, sandy soil for rye and buck wheat; and
that oats thrive better in coarse soil than any other
grain. Now, in directing a rotation, it is not suf∣ficient
that a culmiferous crop be always succeed∣ed
by a leguminous: attention must be also given,
that no crop be introduced that is unfit for the
soil. Wheat, being a great binder, requires more
than any other crop a leguminous crop to follow.
But every such crop is not proper: po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atoes are the
greatest openers of soil; but they are improper in
a wheat-soil. Neither will turnip answer, because
it requires a light soil. A very loose soil, after a
crop of rye requires ryegrass to bind it, or the
treading of cattle in pasturing: but to bind the
soil wheat must not be ventured; for it succeeds
ill in loose soil.</P>
<P>Another consideration of moment in directing
the rotation, is to avoid crops that encourage
weeds. Pease is the fittest of all crops for suc∣ceeding
<PB N="131" REF="157"/>
to wheat, because it renders the ground
loose and mellow, and the same soil agrees with
both. But beware of pease, unless the soil be
left by the wheat perfectly free of weeds; because
pease, if not an extraordinary crop, soster weeds.
Barley may be ventured after wheat, if the farm∣er
be unwilling to lose a crop. It is indeed a rob∣ber;
better however any crop than run the ha∣zard
of poisoning the soil with weeds. But to
prevent the necessity of barley after wheat, the
land ought to be fallowed before the wheat: it
cleans the ground thoroughly, and makes pease
a secure crop after wheat. And after a good crop
of pease, barley never fails. A horse-hoed crop of
turnip is equal to a fallow for rooting out weeds;
but turnip does not suit land that is proper for
wheat. Cabbage does well in wheat-soil; and a
horse-hoed crop of cabbage, which eradicates
weeds, is a good prepartion for wheat to be suc∣ceeded
by pease; and a crop of beans diligently
hand-hoed is in that view little inferior. As red
clover requires the ground to be perfectly clean,
a good crop of it ensures wheat, and next pease.
In loam, a drilled crop of turnip or potatoes pre∣pares
the ground, equal to a fallow, for the same
succession.</P>
<P>Another rule is, to avoid a frequent repetition
of the same species; for to produce good crops,
change of species is no less necessary than change
of seed. The same species returning every second
<PB N="132" REF="158"/>
or third year, will infallibly degenerate, and be
a scanty crop. This is remarkably the case of red
clover. Nor will our fields bear pleasantly per∣petual
crops of wheat after fallow, which is the
practice of some English farmers.</P>
<P>Hitherto of rotation in the same field. I add
one rule concerning rotation in different fields;
which is, to avoid crouding crops one after another
in point of time; but to chuse such as admit in∣tervals
sufficient for leisurely dressing, which gives
opportunity to manage all with the same hands, and
with the same cattle; for example, beans in Ja∣nuary
or February, pease and oats in March, bar∣ley
and potatoes in April, turnip in June or July,
wheat and rye in October.</P>
<P>For illustrating the foregoing rules, a few in∣stances
of exceptionable rotations, will not be
thought amiss. The following is an usual rotation
in Norfolk. First, wheat after red clover. Se∣cond,
barley. Third, turnip. Fourth, barley with
red clover. Fifth, clover cut for hay. Sixth, a
second year's crop of clover commonly pastured.
Dung is given to the wheat and turnip. Against this
rotation several objections lie. Barley after wheat
is improper. The two crops of barley are too
near together. The second crop of clover must
be very bad, if pasturing be the best way of con∣suming
it; and if bad, it is a great encourager of
weeds. But the strongest objection is, that red
clover repeated so frequently in the same field can∣not
<PB N="133" REF="159"/>
not fail to degenerate; and of this the Norfolk
farmers begin to be sensible. Salton in East Lo∣thian
is a clay soil; and the rotation there is,
wheat after fallow and dung. Second, barley af∣ter
two ploughings; the one before winter, the
the other immediately before the seed is sown.
Third, oats. Fourth, pease. Fifth, barley. Sixth,
oats: and then fallow. This rotation consists
chiefly of robbing crops. Pease are the only le∣guminous
crop, which even with the fallow is not
sufficient to loosen a stiff soil. But the soil is good,
which in some measure hides the badness of the ro∣tation.
About Seaton, and all the way from Pre∣ston
to Gossford, the ground is still more severely
handled: wheat after fallow and dung, barley,
oats, pease, wheat, barley, oats, and then an∣other
fallow. The soil is excellent; and it ought
indeed to be so, to support many rounds of such
cropping.</P>
<P>But let not our wonder be confined to this nar∣row
spot; for what better do we find in the great∣est
part of this county? In the parishes of Tra∣nent,
Aberlady, Dirleton, Northberwick, and
Athelstonefoord, the following rotations were for∣merly
universal, and to this day are much more
frequent than any other mode.</P>
<P>1. After fallow with dung, wheat, barley, oats,
pease and beans, barley, oats, wheat.</P>
<P>2. After fallow and dung, barley, oats, pease
and beans, wheat, barley, oats, pease, wheat.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="160"/>
3. After fallow and dung, wheat, oats, pease,
barley, oats, wheat.</P>
<P>4. After fallow and dung, barley, oats, beans,
wheat, pease, barley, oats.</P>
<P>East Lothian, time out of mind, has been fa∣mous
for superior skill in agriculture; and yet, to
seek for instruction there, one would be greatly
misted. That county, for the richness of its crops,
is more indebted to the fertility of its soil, than to
the skill of its farmers. What pity it is, that so
fine a county should be possessed by men so little
grateful to nature for her bounties! But their in∣gratitude
is not suffered to pass with impunity.
Every farmer complains that his crops are not such
as they have been: the decay is visible; but the
cause, however obvious, is not manifest to every
one. Some few who justly ascribe the decay to
severity of cropping, have ventured upon some
alterations; but so imperfectly, from the prepos∣session
of former practice, as to have made no
considerable progress. The following rotations,
held to be improvements upon the former practice,
will justify this observation.</P>
<P>1. After fallow without dung, barley, clover.
Dung laid on the clover-stuble, and after a single
ploughing, wheat, barley, oats.</P>
<P>2. After fallow with dung, wheat, barley,
pease, wheat.</P>
<P>3. After fallow with dung, wheat, beans hand-hoed,
<PB N="135" REF="161"/>
wheat, pease and beans drilled, wheat with
dung, barley, clover. Dung laid on the clove<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-stubble.
Spring-wheat, one furrow before winter,
and one before sowing. Turnip broadcast, bar∣ley
and grass-seeds for pasture.</P>
<P>4. After fallow with dung, wheat, barley with
clover-seed. Clover made hay two years. After
the second year's crop, fallow and dung for wheat,
barley, oats, pease, oats or wheat, turnip with
dung, barley, pease, barley, oats.</P>
<P>5. Potatoes dunged, wheat, pease, barley and
grass-seeds.</P>
<P>6. After fallow with dung, wheat, oats, pease
or elover, wheat, oats, clover. The clover-stub∣ble
dunged for barley, oats, pease after two fur∣rows,
wheat after one furrow.</P>
<P>7. Lincoln barley upon ground opened from
pasture-grass, pease, wheat, turnip, barley, clo∣ver.
The stubble dunged for wheat, beans, bar∣ley,
oats.</P>
<P>8. After fallow and dung, barley, clover red
and white for hay, pasture seven years, oats,
pease, wheat, barley, oats.</P>
<P>9. Turnip after lime and dung. Barley, with
which white clover, yellow clover, tyegrass, and
ribwort, are sown. Pastured with sheep seven
years, broken up for oats, drilled beans, barley,
oats.</P>
<P>These rotations are far from being orthodox;
but it is good to be convinced of an error: and
<PB N="136" REF="162"/>
when once a reformation is fairly begun, it is to
be hoped, that the farmers in the best county of
Scotland, will at last settle in such a rotation of
crops, as will prove no less beneficial to themselves
than to their landlords.</P>
<P>After such severe censure I would gladly make
some apology for the East-Lothian farmers. In
the several Tours of Young the itinerant farmer,
are found, in the best counties of England, ex∣amples
without end, of rotations no less excep∣tionable
than many of those mentioned.</P>
<P>Where a field is laid down for pasture in order
to be recruited, it is commonly left in that state
many years; for it is the universal opinion, that
the longer it lies, the richer it becomes for bear∣ing
corn. This I believe to be true; but in or∣der
to determine the mode of cropping, the im∣portant
point is, what upon the whole is the most
profitable rotation; not what may produce luxu∣riant
crops at a distant period. Upon that point,
I have no hesitation to affirm, that the farmer who
keeps a field in pasture beyond a certain time,
loses every year considerably; and that a few lu∣xuriant
crops of corn, after twenty years of pa∣sture,
and still more after thirty, will not make
up the loss. The novelty of this propofition will
discredit it with the generality; but as the subject
is of capital importance in the management of a
farm, I must notwithstanding hope for a patient
hearing. Grass-seeds intended for hay, produce
<PB N="137" REF="163"/>
the weightiest crop at first: were hay to be taken
many years successively without manure, the crops
would turn exceeding scanty. To prevent loss,
the farmer confines himself to two or three crops;
and then surrenders the field to pasture. The
same happens where a field is laid down with pa∣sture-grasses:
the first year's pasture is more plen∣tiful
than any of the succeeding. For a proof of
which, a field newly laid down for pasture will
draw a greater rent, than after being pastured
seven or eight years; if I should say double, it
would not be far from truth. Nor is it difficult
to assign a cause for the degeneracy. A tree de∣prived
of its top, spreads into a bush, and never
again takes to a head. Grass plants are similar:
the best crops are always at first; and they lessen
gradually, because the plants dwarf gradually.
These plants have certainly not better <HI>stamina vi∣tae</HI>
than an oak: if the latter turn dwarfish by ha∣ving
its head lopped off, what can be expected
from humble vegetables that are cropped every day
and every hour? The dwarfing of plants how∣ever
is confined within a certain limit; otherwise
they would in time disappear altogether. But as
they never after increase in size, they cannot give
much food. The food they give, improves indeed
in quality, and turns richer the older it is; which
is visible by the effects of old grass upon milk,
butter, beef, and mutton. Old grass is valuable
in point of luxury, but far from valuable in point
<PB N="138" REF="164"/>
of profit. The precise time when grass ought to
yield to corn, depends greatly on the nature of the
soil. Our best director is practice. I will only
venture to suggest, that clay soil may, without
loss, be kept in pasture much longer than gravelly
or light soil. The former being retentive of moi∣sture,
preserves grass in vigour, even during the
heat of summer: grass in the latter soon withers
by lack of moisture. This is providential: a light
or gravelly soil can be cultivated almost in any sea∣son:
clay is extremely ticklish; and where suc∣cessfully
laid down for pasture, one would not be
in a hurry to take it up again; especially as it
maintains more cattle, and consequently receives
more dung, than the other kind. It is extreme∣ly
true, that a greater number of corn-crops may
be successfully taken upon a field that has been
long in pasture, than when pastured but a few
years. But will the additional crops of corn o∣verbalance
the mean returns from old grass? Far
from it. Why not then restore a field to corn as
soon as the pasture begins to fail? The corn will
quadruple the value of the pasture: the labour
indeed and expence is greater; but they will be
amply recompensed by the profit.</P>
<P>Though there can lie no objection against this
mode of cropping with respect to profit, a spe∣cious
objection may occur with respect to the effect
it has upon the soil. It may be suspected with
some shew of reason, that plentiful crops without
<PB N="139" REF="165"/>
rest, must in time exhaust the soil, unless prevent∣ed
by extraordinary manure. Experience is our
only means for clearing that doubt; but till the
truth be ascertained by experience, one would
not hesitate to venture a mode of cropping that is
clearly so profitable; considering, that, at the
worst, the soil can be restored by diligent culture,
and extraordinary manure. But I say more. It
will be made evident in the second part, that a
soil well pulverized, and yet not too loose, is what
affords the greatest quantity of food to plants.
Now the mode of cropping above recommended
is intended to preserve the soil in that state, and
must infallibly answer the purpose. However
plentiful therefore the crops may be, this mode of
cropping cannot exhaust the soil.</P>
<P>To be obliged to stand single against all the
world, would make me tremble like an aspin
leaf, were it not impressed upon me, that the dif∣ference
is greater in appearance than in reality.
What I have all along had in view, is a field sown
with grass-seeds, not for hay, but for pasture,
such as white clover, yellow clover, ribwort, rye∣grass.
The first crop of such grasses is undoubt∣edly
the weightiest; and there is a diminution in
quantity annually, till after seven or eight years
there is not half of the food for cattle that was at
first. The plan recommended above, is to take
up the field at that period; and after a few corn∣e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ops,
to lay it down again for pasture. The opi∣nion
<PB N="140" REF="166"/>
I am opposing, is certainly right according
to the common method of laying down ground
for grass. This method is, to sow the field with
ryegrass and red clover, and, after taking hay two
years, to surrender it for pasture. By this me∣thod,
the pasture must undoubtedly be worst at
first: at the end of the two years the red clover
is gone, leaving nothing but the ryegrass, which
does not occupy the fifth part of the ground.
The field accordingly is exceedingly bare for three
or four years; and is not covered till natural
grasses spring up to fill the place of those that are
gone, which, in clay soil especially, will be very
late. From this time, the pasture mends as the
natural grasses thicken; and after a certain pe∣riod,
if they do not improve in quantity, they cer∣tainly
improve in quality. But not to mention,
that grasses which thus occasionally occupy a field,
are not equal to sown grasses for feeding; what I
affirm is, that the farmer pays dear for them,
when he must submit in the interim to very fcanty
crops.</P>
<P>If the lesson here inculcated be solidly founded,
it must produce a great change in the manage∣ment
of a farm. Pasture-grass, while young,
maintains many animals; and the field is greatly
recruited by what they drop: it is even recruited
by hay-crops, provided the grass be cut before
seeding. But as old grass yields little profit, the
field ought to be taken up for corn when the pa∣sture
<PB N="141" REF="167"/>
begins to fail; and after a few crops, it
ought to be laid down again with grass-seeds. Se∣duced
by a chimerical notion, that a field, by fre∣quent
corn-crops, is fatigued and requires rest,
like a labouring man or animal, careful farmers
give long rest to their fields by pasture, never ad∣verting
that it affords little profit. Pity it is, that
by a chimerical noticed they should be tantalized,
to neglect good crops within their reach. It
ought to be their study, to improve their soil, by
making it free and also retentive of moisture. If
they accomplish these ends, they need not be a∣fraid
of exhausting the soil by cropping<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As vegetable and animal food are equally natural to man, it is admirable in Providence, to adjust the foil <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e treads on so happily to his nature, as to yield him more sood by a rotation of corn and grass crops, than if it were confined to either.</NOTE></P>
<P>Where a farmer has access to no manure but
what is his own production, the case under con∣sideration,
there are various rotations of crops, all
of them good, though perhaps not equally so. I
shall begin with two examples, one in clay, and
one in free soil, each of the farms ninety acres.
Six acres are to be inclosed for a kitchen-garden,
in which there must be annually a crop of red clo∣ver,
for summer-food to the working cattle. As
there are annually twelve acres in hay, and twelve
in pasture, a single plough with good cattle will
be sufficient to command the remaining sixty
acres.</P>

<P>When the rotation is completed, the seventh
inclosure having been six years in pasture, is ready
to be taken up for a rotation of crops, which be∣gins
with oats in the year 1781, and proceeds as
in the sixth inclosure. In the same year 1781,
the fifth inclosure is made pasture; for which it
is prepared, by sowing pasture grass-seeds with
the barley of the year 1780. And in this manner
may the rotation be carried on without end.
Here the labour is equally distributed; and there
is no hurry nor confusion. But the chief proper∣ty
of this rotation is, that two culmiferous or
white-corn crops, are never found together: by a
due mixture of crops, the soil is preserved in good
heart without any adventitious manure. At the
<PB N="143" REF="169"/>
same time, the land is always producing plentiful
crops: neither hay nor pasture get time to dege∣nerate.
The whole dung is laid upon the fallow.</P>

<P>Here the dung ought to be applied to the bar∣ley.</P>
<P>Many other rotations may be contrived, keep∣ing
to the rules above laid down. Fallow, for
example, wheat, pease and beans, barley, cab∣bage,
oats, for clay. Here dung must be given
both to the wheat and cabbage. For free soil,
drilled turnip, barley, red clover, wheat upon a
single furrow, drilled potatoes, oats. Both the
turnip and potatoes must have dung. Another for
free soil: turnip drilled and dunged, red clover;
wheat on a single surrow with dung, pease, bar∣ley,
potatoes, oats. The following rotation has
<PB N="145" REF="171"/>
proved successful in a soil proper for wheat. 1.
Oats with red clover, after fallow, without dung.
2. Hay. The clover-stubble dunged, and wheat
sown end of October with a single surrow. 3.
Wheat. 4. Pease. 5. Barley. Fallow again.
Oats are taken the first crop to save the dung for
the wheat. Oats always thrive on a fallow, though
without dung; which is not the case of barley.
But barley seldom fails after pease. In strong
clay soil, the following rotation answers. 1.
Wheat after fallow and dung. 2. Beans sown
under furrow as early as possible. Above the
beans, sow pease end of March, half a boll per
acre, and harrow them in. The two grains will
ripen at the same time. 3. Oats or barley on a
winter-furrow with grass-seeds. 4. Hay for one
year or two; the second growth pastured. Lay
what dung can be spared on the hay-stubble, and
sow wheat with a single surrow. 5. Wheat. 6.
Beans or pease. 7. Oats. Fallow again.</P>

<DIV3 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">REAPING CORN AND HAY CROPS, AND STO∣RING
THEM UP FOR USE.</HEAD>
<P>CULMIFEROUS plants are ripe when the stem is
totally white: they are not fully ripe if any
green streaks remain. Some farmers are of opi∣nion,
<PB N="146" REF="172"/>
that wheat ought to be cut before it is fully
ripe. Their reasons are, first, that ripe wheat
is apt to shake, and, next, that the flour is not
so good. With respect to the last, it is contrary
to nature, that any seed can be better in an unripe
state, than when brought to perfection: nor will
it be found so upon trial. With respect to the
first, wheat, at the point of perfection, is not
more apt to shake than for some days before: the
husk begins not to open till after the seed is fully
ripe; and then the suffering the crop to stand be∣comes
ticklish: after the minute of ripening, it
should be cut down in an instant, if possible.</P>
<P>This leads to the hands that are commonly en∣gaged
to cut down corn. In this country, the u∣niversal
practice was, to provide a number of
hands, in proportion to the extent of the crop,
without regard to the time of ripening. By this
method, the reapers were often idle for want of
work; and what is much worse, they had often
more work than they could overtake, and ripe
fields were laid open to shaking winds. The Lo∣thians
have long enjoyed weekly markets for
reapers, where a farmer can provide himself with
the number he wants; and this practice is creep∣ing
into neighbouring shires. Where there is no
opportunity of such markets, ought not neigh∣bouring
farmers to agree in borrowing and lend∣ing
their reapers? The advantage is obvious;
and yet I believe it is seldom practised.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="173"/>
One should imagine, that a caveat against cut∣ting
corn when wet, is unnecessary; yet from the
impatience of farmers to prevent shaking, no ca∣veat
is more so. Why do they not consider, that
corn standing, dries in half a day, when in a close
sheaf, the weather must be favourable if it dry in a
month? in moist weather it will never dry.</P>
<P>With respect to the manner of cutting, I must
premise, that barley is of all the most difficult
grain to be dried for keeping. Having no husk,
rain has easy access; and it has a tendency to mal∣ten
when wet. Where the ground is properly
smoothed by rolling, I am clear for cutting it
down with the sythe. This manner being more
expeditious than the sickle, removes it sooner
from the danger of wind; and gives a third more
straw, which is a capital article for dung, where a
farm is at a distance from other manure. I ex∣cept
only corn that has lodged; for there the sic∣kle
is more convenient than the sythe. As it
ought to be dry when cut, bind it up directly: if
allowed to lie any time in the swath, it is apt to
be discoloured.</P>
<P>Barley sown with grass-seeds, red clover espe∣cially,
requires a different management. Where
the grass is cut along with it, the difficulty is great
of getting it so dry as to be ventured in a stack.
The cunning way is, to cut the barley with a sickle
above the clover, so as that nothing but clean
barley is bound up. Cut with a sythe the stubble
<PB N="148" REF="174"/>
and grass: they make excellent winter-food. The
same method is applicable to oats; with this only
difference, that when the field is exposed to the
south-west wind, it is less necessary to bind im∣mediately
after mowing. As wheat commonly
grows higher than any other grain, it is difficult
to manage it with the sythe; for which reason
the sickle is preferred in England. Pease and
beans grow so irregularly, as to make the sickle
necessary.</P>
<P>The best way for drying pease, is to keep se∣parate
the handfuls that are cut: though in this
way they wet easily, they dry as soon. In the
common way of heaping pease together for com∣posing
a sheaf, they wet as easily, and dry not
near so soon. With respect to beans, the top of
the handful last cut, ought to be laid on the bot∣tom
of the former; which gives ready access to
the wind. By this method pease and beans are
ready for the stack in half the ordinary time.</P>
<P>The size of the sheaves ought to be regarded.
A sheaf commonly is made as large as can be
comained in two lengths of the corn made into a
rope. To save frequent tying, the binder presses
it down with his knee, and binds it so hard as to∣tally
to exclude the air. If there be any moisture
in the crop, which seldom fails, a process of fer∣mentation
and putrefaction commences in the
sheaf; which is perfected in the stack, to the de∣struction
both of corn and straw. How barba∣rous
<PB N="149" REF="175"/>
and stupid is it, to make the size of a sheaf
depend on the height of the plants! By that
rule, a wheat-sheaf is commonly so weighty, as to
be unmanageable by ordinary arms: it requires
an effort to move it, that frequently bursts the
knot, and occasions loss of grain, beside the trou∣ble
of a second tying. I have long practised the
following method with success. My sheaves are
never larger than to be contained in one length
of the plant, cut close to the ground: I admit no
exception if the plants be above eighteen inches
high. The binder's arm compresses the sheaf
sufficiently, without need of his knee. The addi∣tional
hands that this way of binding may require,
are not to be regarded, compared with the advan∣tage
of drying soon. Corn thus managed may be
ready for the stack in a week: it seldom in the
ordinary way requires less than a fortnight, and
frequently longer. Of a small sheaf compressed
by the arm only, the air pervades every part;
nor is it so apt to be unloosed as a large sheaf,
however firmly bound. I omit the gathering of
sheaves into shocks, because the common method
is orthodox, which is to place the shocks directed
to the south west, in order to resist the force of
that wind. Five sheaves on each side make a
sufficient stay; and a greater number cannot be
covered with two head-sheaves.</P>
<P>Every article is of importance that hastens the
operation, in a country like Scotland, subjected to
<PB N="150" REF="176"/>
unequal harvest-weather; for which reason, the
most expeditious method should be chosen for
carrying corn from the field to the stack-yard.
Our carriages are generally too small or too large.
A sledge is a very aukward machine: many hands
are required, and little progress made. Waggons
and large carts are little less dilatory, as they must
stand in the yard till unloaded sheaf by sheaf. My
way is, to use long carts moveable upon the axle,
so as at once to throw the whole load on the
ground; which is forked up to the stack by a
hand appointed for that purpose. By this me∣thod,
two carts will do the work of four or five.</P>
<P>It will not be easy to convince me, that build∣ing
round stacks in the yard is not preferable to
housing the corn. There it is shut up from the
air; and it must be exceedingly dry, if it contract
not a mustiness, which is the first step to putrefac∣tion.
Let me add another circumstance, which
would make a figure were it detached from that
now mentioned. In the yard, a stack is preserved
from rats and mice by being set on a pedestal:
no method has hitherto been invented, for preser∣ving
corn in a house from such destructive ver∣min.
The proper manner of building, is to make
every sheaf incline downward from its top to its
bottom. Where the sheaves are laid horizontally,
the stack will take in rain both above and be∣low.
The best form of a stack is that of a cone
placed on a cylinder; and the top of the cone
<PB N="151" REF="177"/>
should be formed with three sheaves drawn to a
point. If the upper part of the cylinder be a little
wider than the under, so much the better.</P>
<P>The delaying to cover a stack for two or three
weeks, though common, is however wonderfully
absurd; for if much rain fall in the interim, it is
beyond the power of wind to dry the stack. Ve∣getation
begun in the external parts, shuts out
the air from the internal; and to prevent a total
putrefaction, the stack must be thrown down, and
exposed to the air, every sheaf. In order to have
a stack covered the moment it is finished, straw
and ropes ought to be ready; and the covering
ought to be so thick as to be proof against rain.</P>
<P>Scotland is subject not only to floods of rain, but
to high winds. Good covering guards against the
former, and ropes artfully applied guards against
the latter. I will answer for the following mode.
Take a hay-rope well twisted, and surround the
stack with it, two feet or so below the top. Sur∣round
the stack with another such rope immedi∣ately
below the easing. Connect these two with
ropes in an up and down position, distant from
each other at the easing about five or six feet.
Then surround the stack with other circular
ropes parallel to the two first mentioned, giving
them a twist round every one of those that lie up
and down, by which the whole will be connected
together in a sort of network. What remains is,
to finish the two feet at the top of the stack. Let
<PB N="152" REF="178"/>
it be covered with bunches of straw laid regularly
up and down; the under part to be put under the
circular rope first mentioned, which will keep it
fast, and the upper part be bound by a small rope
artfully twisted, commonly called <HI>the crown of
the stack.</HI> This method is preferable to the com∣mon
way of laying long ropes over the top of the
stack, and tying them to the belting-rope; which
flattens the top, and makes it take in rain. A
stack covered in the way here described, will stand
two years secure both against wind and rain; a
notable advantage in this variable climate. So
much for corn. Now for hay.</P>
<P>The great aim in making hay is, to preserve as
much of the sap as possible. All agree in this;
and yet differ widely in the means of making
that aim effectual. To describe all the different
means might be profitable to the bookseller; but
the reader would lose patience, and gather no in∣struction.
I shall therefore confine myself to what
I think the best. A crop of ryegrass and yellow
clover ought to be spread as cut. A day or two
after, when the dew is evaporated, rake it into a
number of parallel rows along the field, termed
<HI>wind-rows,</HI> for the convenience of putting it up
into small cocks. After turning the rows once
and again, make small cocks weighing a stone or
two. At the distance of two days or so, put two
cocks into one, observing always to mix the tops
and bottoms together, and to take a new place
<PB N="153" REF="179"/>
for each cock, that the least damage possible may
be done to the grass. Proceed in putting two
cocks into one, till sufficiently dry for tramp-ricks
of 100 stone each. The easiest way of erecting
tramp-ricks, is to found a rick in the middle of
the row of cocks that are to compose it. The
cocks may be carried to the rick by two persons
joining arms together. When all the cocks are
thus carried to the rick within the distance of forty
yards or so, the rest of the cocks will be more
expeditiously carried to the rick, by a rope wound
about them and dragged by a horse. Two ropes
are sufficient to secure the ricks from wind, the
short time they are to stand in the field. This
very year, 1775, ten thousand stone were put into
tramp-ricks the fourth day after cutting. In a
country so wet as many parts of Scotland are, ex∣pedition
is of mighty consequence in the drying
both of hay and corn. With respect to hay in∣tended
for horned cattle, it is by the generality
held an improvement, that it be heated a little in
the stack. But I violently suspect this doctrine to
have been invented for excusing indolent manage∣ment.
An ox, it is true, will eat such hay; but
I have always found that he prefers sweet hay;
and it cannot well be doubted, but that such hay
is the most salutary and the most nourishing.</P>
<P>The making hay consisting chiefly of red clo∣ver,
requires more care. The season of cutting
is the last week of June, when it is in full bloom:
<PB N="154" REF="180"/>
earlier it may be cut, but never later. To cut it
later, would indeed produce a weightier crop; but
a late first cutting makes the second also late, per∣haps
too late for drying. At the same time, the
want of weight in an early first cutting, is amply
compensated by the weight of the second.</P>
<P>The additional labour required to make hay of
red clover, arises from the largeness of the stem,
and the hazard of the leaves dropping off in moist
weather. I have tried two methods. One is, to
let it lie in the swath two days, and longer if the
weather be unfavourable. The swaths must be
turned over and over two or three times every
day, but not unless the weather be dry. It will
then be ready to be put into cocks, containing each
about two stone. After two, three, or four days,
according to the weather, let two cocks be put
into one; and so on at proper intervals till ready
for the tramp-rick. The other way, more expe∣ditious,
may be ventured on where ryegrass is
mixed with the clover. Stir it not the day it is
cut. Turn it in the swath the forenoon of the
next day; and in the afternoon put it up in small
cocks. The third day, put two cocks into one,
enlarging every day the cocks till they be ready
for the tramp-rick.</P>
<P>When the season is too variable for making hay
of the second growth, mix straw with that growth,
which will be a substantial food for cattle during
winter. This is commonly done by laying strata
<PB N="155" REF="181"/>
of the straw and clover alternately in the stack.
But this method I cannot approve: if the strata
of clover do not heat, they turn mouldy at least,
and unpalatable. The better way is, to mix them
carefully with the hand before they be put into
the stack. The dry straw imbibes moisture from
the clover, and prevents heating.</P>
<P>I must add in general with respect to hay of
whatever kind, that if the weather be so wet as
to prevent cocking in the ordinary time, there
ought to be no intermission in turning the swaths;
which will help to evaporate the moisture, if there
be any motion in the air; and at the same time,
prevent the swaths from sinking into the ground
among the uncut grass, which never sails to blanch
it.</P>
<P>The expence of making an acre of hay, com∣posed
of ryegrass and yellow clover, is, in a tole∣rable
season, from four to six shillings; and from
six to eight if composed of red clover. This how∣ever
is an uncertain computation, the expence
differing greatly in a good or bad season.</P>
<P>I will not stop to give any rule for making hay
of natural grass, termed <HI>meadow-hay;</HI> because
in a well-conducted farm there ought to be no
meadow-hay. This is made evident in the chap∣ter
<HI>Rotation of Crops.</HI></P>
<P>In the yard, a stack of hay ought to be an ob∣long
square, if the quantity be greater than to be
easily stowed in a round stack: because a smaller
<PB N="156" REF="182"/>
surface is exposed to the air, than in a number of
round stacks. For the same reason, a stack of
pease ought to have the same form, the straw be∣ing
more valuable than that of oats, wheat, or
barley. The moment a stack is finished, it
ought to be covered; because the surface-hay
is much damaged by withering in dry weather,
and moistening in wet weather. Let it have a pa∣vilion-roof;
for more of it can be covered with
straw in that shape, than when built perpendicu∣lar
at the ends. Let it be roped as directed a∣bove
for corn-stacks; with this difference only,
that in an oblong square the ropes must be
thrown over the top, and tied to the belt-rope
below. This belt-rope ought to be fixed with
pins to the stack; the reason is, that the ropes
thrown over the stack will bag by the sinking of
the stack, and may be drawn tight by lowering
the belt-rope, and fixing it in its new position with
the same pins.</P>
<P>The stems of hops, being long and tough,
make excellent ropes; and it will be a saving ar∣ticle,
to propagate a few plants of that kind for
that very end.</P>
<P>A stack of ryegrass-hay, a year old, and of a
moderate size, will weigh, each cubic yard, e∣leven
Dutch stone. A stack of clover-hay in the
same circumstances weighs somewhat less.</P>
<P>I conclude this article with observing, that till
lately the making hay was little understood in
<PB N="157" REF="183"/>
Scotland; nor to this day is it generally under∣stood.
The method was, to expose it as much as
possible to the sun and wind, and never to give it
rest till it was so dry as to be grindable in a mill,
and rendered a <HI>caput mortuum.</HI> The poor ani∣mals
reduced to such food, were truly to be pi∣tied:
is it wonderful that they were too feeble
for work? But this made no impression, as the
feebleness of the cattle was but in proportion to
the laziness of the men. They had no check of
conscience for being idle, because they were edu∣cated
in that way, and knew no better.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">FEEDING FARM-CATTLE.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING discussed the management of corn
and hay, what naturally follows is, to ap∣ply
them to the maintenance of farm-cattle: for
to consider them as the food of human beings,
falls not properly under any branch of agricul∣ture.</P>
<P>As in this chapter are contained many different
matters upon which the profit of a farm greatly
depends, I wish to inculcate what I have to say
with perspicuity. In that view the chapter is di∣vided
into five sections. Green food is the sub∣ject
of the first; dry food, of the second; feed∣ing
for the butcher, of the third: the fourth con∣tains
<PB N="158" REF="184"/>
rules for the wintering of cattle that are not
intended for immediate sale; and the fifth, rules
for buying and selling cattle and corn.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>1. GREEN FOOD.</HEAD>
<P>I being this section with the summer-food of
farm-horses. The manner of feeding them du∣ring
summer, is and has been various through
Scotland: none of them good. Some time ago,
horses were fed in balks between ridges of corn,
which required the attendance of men, and wa∣sted
much time. In many parts, horses are re∣duced
to thistles; the time of the men being consu∣med
in pulling, and of the horses in eating. In
some places, a part of the common pasture is re∣served
for them, termed <HI>hained grass.</HI> The
man appointed to attend them falls asleep, and
suffers the horses to trespass on the corn. Dogs
are employed to chase them from it: they run
about; and their fatigue is little less than when at
work. To prevent this, the horses are sometimes
tethered on the hained grass: the half is lost, be∣ing
trodden under foot; beside that they often
break loose, and destroy the standing corn. The
least exceptionable is a grass-inclosure; and yet
far from deserving approbation. In the first
place, where the grass is so rank as to fill the hor∣ses
in the intervals of work, a fourth part at least
is trodden under foot: the horses beside are pe∣stered
<PB N="159" REF="185"/>
in hot weather with flies, and cannot feed
with ease. In the next place, they have no time
for resting; and much time is lost in laying hold
of them for the yoke. Lastly, few inclosures in
the hands of a tenant, are in so good order as to
keep in horses when they see corn; and if they
once break out, it is in vain to think of impri∣soning
them after. The approved method to pre∣vent
every inconvenience, is to feed the horses
with cut grass, under cover. In the interval be∣tween
the work of the forenoon and afternoon,
they can fill the belly in an hour, and have time
to rest another hour: nor is a moment lost in yo∣king.</P>
<P>Several plants serve this purpose, sainfoin, lu∣cern,
red clover, white clover, ryegrass. Red
clover is the best. Sainfoin and lucern early cut
are excellent food; but when they turn strong
and reedy, horses are not fond of them. The dis∣advantage
of white clover and ryegrass, is, that,
being small plants, they are difficult to be collect∣ed
in heaps for food. Red clover is extremely
luxuriant: it is easily collected; and it ought to be
easily collected; for to feed properly a horse of a
middle size, requires ten stone a-day. It flowers
the first week of June; but in rich soil it will rise
to eighteen inches before flowering. So rapid is
its growth, that in good soil it may be cut thrice
in a year, and afford over and above some pasture.
It should be cut in the morning when moist with
<PB N="160" REF="186"/>
dew: it is less palatable when cut dry. The cut∣ting
ought to begin long before flowering; that
all may be cut before it is too old, and that it may
grow the faster for a second cutting. These con∣siderations
are not sufficiently attended to: people
are loath to cut till the clover is fully grown; tho'
early cutting will upon the whole afford more
food, as well as more palatable food, to horses
especially, which dislike old clover. I despair not
to see all the corn-farmers in Scotland, depending
on red clover for the summer-food of their cattle;
and then we shall no longer be stunned with loud
complaints commonly thrown out as excuses for
idleness: “How can I improve, having no food
for my horses but bare lea or thistles? they
cannot work on such food; I cannot stir a
foot.” A horse works as he is fed: it is sur∣prising
what work he will perform upon cut clo∣ver,
without losing flesh. Many a summer, for
seven or eight weeks running, have my horses
been daily employed in bringing lime from a
quarry fifteen English miles distant, fed on red
clover only; and at the end of the season, as
plump and hearty as at the beginning. Let an∣other
article be considered. In every farm, a
great proportion is left out for pasture, if that can
be called pasture which affords little or no food.
A single acre of good red clover, will give more
food than fifteen or twenty such acres. How
<PB N="161" REF="187"/>
much better might these acres be employed in
bearing profitable crops of corn?</P>
<P>But a skilful farmer will not confine himself to
red clover for summer-food. There are other
grasses that spring more early, and grow later than
red clover. Ryegrass, ribwort, and yellow clo∣ver,
flower a month before red clover, are fully
ready for cutting green the middle of May, and
if cut at that time continue growing, and may be
cut a fortnight after red clover is gone. To en∣large
the period of green food for cattle, is a de∣sireable
object in husbandry. It affords plenty of
food both early and late; it saves pasture-fields in
spring till the grass cover the ground, which re∣tains
the dew, and shelters the grass-roots from
withering winds; and it enables the farmer to
leave his fields rough at the end of the season to
keep out the frost during winter, instead of eat∣ing
them bare, which is the ordinary practice.
Now these salutary effects, all of them, may be
procured by a very simple operation; which is, to
fow part of the field with ryegrass, ribwort, and
yellow clover mixed. These plants are ready for
being cut the middle of May; and if the season
prove favourable, they may be cut again as late
as even the middle of November. Cut grass is
of all the cheapest food, and the most agreeable
to horses; and therefore to add a month of this
food, is a valuable improvement; especially during
spring, for however nourishing dry food may be,
<PB N="162" REF="188"/>
yet a horse put upon green food turns remarkably
more agile and plump<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It may be agreeable to bring under one view the grasses mentioned above, with respect to the season of their shooting and ripening.</P>
<P>Ryegrass sown in spring with corn, shoots the year fol∣lowing, from the 20th to the 30th of April, according to the soil and season. It flowers from the 1st to the 10th of June. The flower continues about eight days, falls off, and the seed at that time begins to form. The seed is ripe between 1st and 10th July. When it is fully formed, the stalk begins to turn brown; and more and more so till the seed fall, which is about the end of July.</P>
<P>Ribwort shoots the last week of April. The head in a thriving plant is three inches long, full of seed, which is completely ripe about the 10th of July. Upon the head are found at the same time seed formed, flowers, and part that has not yet flowered.</P>
<P>Red clover shoots from the 1st to the 10th of June; and in eight days after begins to flower. It continues in flower twenty days; and about the end of July the seed is ripe. The progress of white clover is precisely the same.</P>
<P>Yellow clover shoots the last week of April, and flowers till August. On a stalk is found at the same time, seed ripe, seed half ripe, flowers, and shoots just beginning. It accordingly resembles pease, and grows a long time. Its continual growing keeps the stem full of sap. The time of cutting plants for hay is in the middle of their flowering; but as yellow clover flowers much longer than the others mentioned, it affords a greater latitude for cutting without injuring the hay.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I proceed to the summer-food of horned cattle.
A beast that chews the cud, takes in at once a
<PB N="163" REF="189"/>
large quantity of green food, especially of red clo∣ver,
which is extremely palatable when young.
So large a quantity is apt to ferment with the
heat of the stomach, so as sometimes to make the
creature burst. This is considered as a formi∣dable
objection to the feeding horned cattle on
red clover. But it is easily obviated, by feeding
them in the house: servants will not readily give
more than sufficient, when cutting and carrying is
a work of labour. And red clover should always
be cut for food; for where cattle have liberty to
pasture, more is trampled down than is eaten.
At any rate, bursting may be prevented even when
cattle are allowed to pasture. Indulge them but
half an hour or so, for two or three days when the
clover is dry; after which there is no hazard. If
yellow clover and ribwort be sown with red clo∣ver,
there is little or no hazard of fermenting to
such a degree as to be hurtful. White clover is
no remedy: it ferments in the stomach as much
as red clover.</P>
<P>Red clover cut green, is preferable to all other
food for milk cows. Being soon filled, they have
much time to rest, which increase the quantity
of milk. The milk at the same time is richer
and higher coloured, than from any other food.</P>
<P>Red clover is good food for sheep; but the cut∣ting
it for them would be too expensive. White
clover at the same time is their favourite, which
is never wanting in good soil, growing naturally.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="190"/>
One signal advantage of feeding horses and
horned cattle in the house during summer, is their
being protected from heat and insects. And it is
a still more signal advantage, that the dung turns
to much better account, than when scattered du∣ring
summer in a pasture-field. Horse-dung in a
pasture-field is totally lost: it dries, and withers a∣way,
not to mention that its heat burns the grass
it falls on. Dung is an article of great import∣ance,
especially in a farm distant from other ma∣nure.
And a dunghill, procured by feeding on
cut grass, may be considerably increased by feed∣ing
the cattle with straw; and by adding to the heap
every weed that grows in the farm, which at any
rate ought to be cut, to prevent seeding.</P>
<P>The carrying cut grass from the field to the
stable, is a laborious work; and the only circum∣stance
that weighs against cut grass in competition
with pasture. A horse of a middle size will eat
ten Dutch stone daily; some go the length of se∣venteen:
an ox or a cow will eat eight stone.
Supposing in a farm ten horses, ten oxen, and six
cows: they will consume 128 stone a-day. If the
clover be at any distance, that quantity requires a
cart going continually from morning till evening.
Computing a cart at three shillings per day, the
expence for the six summer-months is no less than
L. 25, 4 s. Even this high expence, is far from
counterbalancing the advantage of feeding cattle
in the house. The expence, however, is so consi∣derable,
<PB N="165" REF="191"/>
as to make it of importance to lessen it.
In that view, I recommend the following plan, the
purpose of which is, to carry cattle to their food,
instead of carrying food to the cattle. Erect a
moveable shed in the field, all of wood, the back
considerably higher than the front, in order to
have a sloping roof against rain. Sixteen feet in
wideness is sufficient for a beast of any size; the
length corresponding to the number of cattle that
are to be fed. On the back at the heads of the
cattle, a deal is hung with hinges, to be lifted up
for throwing food to them. Upon the ground a∣long
the length of the house, three beams are laid,
crossed with spars an inch distant from each other.
The channel or gutter behind the cattle, is lined
with a deal in the bottom, and one on each side,
to convey the piss from the cattle to a pit filled
with rich earth; which I hold to be preferable
even to dung itself. The three beams covered
with spars make a vacuity below, which receives
the piss at the first instance, and preserves the
cattle dry. This is an important article in feeding
cattle, which every animal at liberty is fond to
procure to itself. There is no necessity for hecks
in this shed; on the contrary, horses eat more
conveniently in the natural way, by bending down
the neck to food. The only thing necessary is a
board between their fore feet and the clover, to
save it from being trampled under foot. It is
proper that in a corner a bed be erected for a
<PB N="166" REF="192"/>
servant, to attend the cattle during night. The
deals of this shade must be held together with
wooden nails, so as easily to be taken down, and
set up again where it may be wanted. It should
be placed at the lowest part of the field; because
the clover is more weighty, than the dung it produ∣ces.
It is possible to set a little shed on wheels, to
be carried from place to place, without being taken
down; but that will never answer for a shed of
thirty or forty yards long. Such a shed is proper
in every farm, where red clover is annually raised
in the course of cropping; and the expence will
be the less grudged, considering that it also an∣swers
for consuming turnip and cabbage in win∣ter.
Let the expence be computed of carrying
these to an immoveable shed; and in a farm of
any extent, it will be found that the expence thus
saved, even in a single year, will equal the cost of
the proposed shed. In a small farm, where red
clover enters not into the rotation of crops, and
yet is necessary for summer-feeding; the most
convenient way is, to inclose fix or seven acres as
near as may be to the farm-offices, upon a part
of which there always may be a crop of red clo∣ver
in rotation. In that case the carriage is a
trisle. I have only to add, that room should not
be spared; for horses are hurt as much as horn∣ed
cattle by being crowded.</P>
<P>The proper seasons for disposing of cattle fatted
on grass, are the June markets, and those of De∣cember
<PB N="167" REF="193"/>
and January. With a view to the first,
early grass ought to be provided, and late grass
with a view to the others. In an open winter,
there is no difficulty to preserve grass-cattle
fat through December and January: in a hard
winter, the addition of a little hay will do.</P>
<P>Next in order is the feeding cattle in a pasture-field.
White clover is for pasture the best grass
known in Britain, being extremely palatable to
cattle of every kind. Being a native of Britain,
it propagates itself by spreading along the surface,
and taking root at every joint. But as this is a
work of time, it is more profitable to stock the field
with it at once: thirty pounds of seed are no more
than sufficient for an acre. Good seed is weighty,
and full, without dimples: it is red when hurt
in drying. A field intended for pasture, requires
a mixture of grasses: every species has its favou∣rite
grass; and when animals of different kinds
feed together, not a single stump is left. Differ∣ent
grasses also, having different times of flowering,
keep the chain of food more complete during the
season. Ryegrass for example answers for spring-food
better than any other plant, and continues
longer after autumn. But white clover during
summer holds out better than ryegrass. Different
grasses at the same time excite the appetite: an
ox will leave turnip for cabbage; and after feed∣ing
plentifully on both, will take kindly to hay
or straw. The proper quantity of seed to an acre
<PB N="168" REF="194"/>
intended for immediate pasture, is ten pounds
white clover, five pounds yellow clover, as much
ribbed grass, and two wheat-firlots of ryegrass.</P>
<P>A field proper for pasture, ought to have the
following properties. It ought to be well aired.
Second, well watered. Third, well sheltered.
Fourth, the larger the better. And, lastly, the
grass ought to be so rank as to afford a full bite.
With respect to the first, a field well aired makes
cattle feed kindly: in a hot day, they go to the
highest part for fresh air: if they have neither
fresh air nor water to resort to, they fret, and lose
flesh. The want however may be supplied artifi∣cially,
by clumps of trees scattered through the
field, to shelter them from the sun. With respect
to the second, plenty of water for drinking is not
alone sufficient: there ought to be plenty for bath∣ing
in a hot day: cattle are never more at ease
in such a day, than when they are plunged in wa∣ter.
With respect to the third, it is not sufficient
that cattle be sheltered against heat: shelter a∣gainst
cold is still more necessary. By proper
management, the chain of grass may be carried
on in tolerable weather till the end of the year;
but unless the cattle be protected from cold blasts,
grass will do them little good. The clumps men∣tioned
planted in the form of a cross, will afford
shelter from whatever quarter the storm comes.
With regard to the fourth, the field ought to be
so large as to give cattle their natural range. E∣very
<PB N="169" REF="195"/>
species of animals that feed on grass have a
natural range in feeding; and to consine them
within narrower bounds, is to them a sort of im∣prisonment.
Sheep have a wide range; and ought
to have, because they delight in short grass: give
them eighty or ninety acres, and any fence will
keep them in: consine them to a field of seven or
eight acres, and it must be a very strong fence
that keeps them in. A range of fifty or sixty
acres is sufficient for horses; and a still narrower
range for horned cattle. In opposition to the field
described, advert to cattle cooped up in a small
inclosure of eight or nine acres, surrounded with
high hedges. In summer they are stifled for want
of air, are pestered with insects, and lose fat in∣stead
of gaining. To examine the progress of
fattening, I weighed twenty stots the first day of
May and the first day of the five succeeding
months. Their quickest advance was in May and
September, being at an average two pounds daily
each. I could not attribute this to any other
cause, but to less heat and fewer insects than in
the three intermediate months. With respect to
the property last in order, the benefit of a full
bite is too obvious to need explanation.</P>
<P>A pasture-field bare of grass in spring, having
no protection against withering winds, turns hard
and unfit for vegetation, especially after wet wea∣ther.
But where a field springs early, and is co∣vered
with grass before drought sets in, it con∣tinues
<PB N="170" REF="196"/>
moist and tender, by retaining dew and
keeping out drought. To encourage early grass
in spring, the field ought to be left rough in win∣ter;
which also keeps the ground warm, and pro∣tects
the roots from frost.</P>
<P>Ragwort is a troublesome guest, as it never
fails to infest rich pasture-fields: it is not only a
robber, but overshadows the grass, and renders it
unwholesome. I am at a loss however whether to
call it a weed or an useful plant. As it bears no
seed till the third year of its growth, it cannot
propagate in land under tillage: in pasture-land, it
dies indeed after dropping its seed, but new plants
spring from that seed, and have a succession with∣out
end. Many things in appearance noxious,
have been found useful; of which this plant is an
instance. The same means will prevent its no∣xious
effects, and make it profitable. Ragwort
in flower was never seen in a field pastured with
sheep. Why? because that animal is excessively
sond of it. Therefore, in every pasture-field, for
some years after it is laid down, there ought to
be a proportion of sheep. They prefer ragwort
before any other vegetable; and experience pro∣nounces,
that every food is wholesome which an
animal is fond of. Lincolnshire sheep do best;
because a fence sufficient for horned cattle,
is more than sufficient for them. Sheep are
singular with respect also to other food. They
<PB N="171" REF="197"/>
are fond of the tender shoots of broom and whins;
and no less so of the fruit of the horse-chesnut.</P>
<P>The rush may be compared to ragwort: it is a
troublesome weed; and yet may be made in some
degree profitable. Whether it should be classed
among the evergreens, appears doubtful from the
following account of it. It springs six or seven
inches high in April, grows on till August, when
the seed appears at the side of the stem, five or
six inches below the top. While the seed is draw∣ing
toward maturity, the part above withers gra∣dually;
and when the seed ripens and falls, the part
below withers down till within a foot or so of the
ground. That part continues green all winter,
but dies away before next summer. In place of
the stems that thus die, fresh stems arise, which,
as observed above, make a figure in April. Whe∣ther
these stems arise from seed, or from the
bulky root, or from both, I cannot at present de∣termine.</P>
<P>As the rush is an aquatic, and grows so vigo∣rously
as to destroy all other plants, it ought to be
rooted out if possible; not only because it is a bad
pasture-grass, but because the infallible way of
rooting it out is, to lay the ground dry; which
makes a double improvement. But if this cannot
be got done at a moderate expence, the resource
is, to make all the profit of it that is possible.
If cut in June while young and tender, and dried
into hay, rushes make tolerable winter-food: a fresh
<PB N="172" REF="198"/>
growth ensues which is proof against frost, and is
not unsavoury to cattle that run out all winter.</P>
<P>In the month of April, while grass is still so
short as not to afford a bite to horned cattle, I
have seen fourteen cows living on rushes. At
that season, they are to horned cattle almost as pa∣latable
as red clover. They are rejected when
old; and so is even red clover.</P>
<P>A sprat is not an evergreen, for it dies away in
winter. It is an aquatic, like a rush, but thrives
with a less degree of moisture. It may be of some
use for hay when cut in June; and the after
growth is not unpalatable when eat young. But
after seeding no beast will touch it.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>2. DRY FOOD.</HEAD>
<P>I proceed now to dry food. As hay is of use
to cattle of every kind, it is a capital object in
husbandry; and not the less capital, that in my
thought it may be carried to greater perfection
than is commonly done. To give satisfaction, we
must enter into an examination of the different
grasses that are used for making hay. Red clover
is a succulent plant, of the leguminous tribe, that
flowers about the beginning of June, and rises to
the height of between three and four feet. Rye∣grass
is a culmiferous plant, dry and solid, like o∣ther
plants of that tribe; rising commonly in good
soil to four feet, or nearly so. It shoots the end
<PB N="173" REF="199"/>
of April or beginning of May; and above all o∣ther
plants hastens to perfect its seed. Yellow
clover and ribwort, both of them leguminous
plants, are more tender and succulent than rye∣grass;
but less so than red clover: they rise com∣monly
to between three and four feet. They
shoot at the same time with ryegrass, but perfect
their seed not altogether so soon. Ryegrass, be∣cause
of its solidity, is of all the best food for
horses; and next to it, yellow clover and ribwort.
Horned cattle delight in leguminous plants, red
clover especially: it is probable that tender grasses
are fittest for animals that chew the cud. White
clover blooms and perfects its seed at the same
time with red clover: it makes excellent dry food
for sheep; but as it seldom rises above eighteen
inches, it is less proper for hay than any of the o∣thers
mentioned; and upon that account, is often
left out in the mixture of grasses for hay.</P>
<P>With respect to the time of endurance, red
clover cannot be depended on for hay longer than
two years: the third year, it makes at best a
scanty crop, and frequently vanishes altogether.
Ryegrass, ribwort, and yellow clover, stand good
three years. From that time, the product lessens
gradually; and after the seventh or eighth year
they afford little pasture.</P>
<P>The general practice of Britain has been, to
mix for hay, ryegrass and red clover with a
small proportion of white clover; which I be∣lieve
continues to be the practice in many places.
<PB N="174" REF="200"/>
I cannot help condemning it, as the child of igno∣rance
or inattention. Two weighty objections
occur. The first is, that when the red clover is fit
to be cut for hay, which is about the beginning
of July, the ryegrass-seed is ripe. And what fol∣lows?
the ryegrass that year grows no more han
barley or wheat cut when the seed is ripe;
whereas if ryegrass be cut before the seed is form∣ed,
it grows all summer, and even all winter, till
it makes way for new shoots in spring. It may
possibly be thought, that the seed, like that of o∣ther
culmiferous plants, is more than sufficient to
make up the seantiness of subsequent cuttings;
but in drying for hay, most of it is lost, some in
the field, some in the stack, and some in the hay-loft;
little being left but the dry straw, which
cattle do not willingly eat. The other objection
is of still greater weight. After a crop or two of
hay, the field is surrendered to pasture. The red
clover wears out the second year, leaving nothing
but the ryegrass, which continues but another year
in perfection: and the small proportion of white
clover has not yet got time to spread over the
field. Thus, after the second year, the pasture
is but indifferent; and turns worse and worse un∣less
the field happen to stock itself with natural
grasses. Nor is that all: while the field is but
half-stocked with sown grasses, weeds take posses∣sion
of the yacuities, and accelerate the dwarfing
of the ryegrass white clover. And if the red
<PB N="175" REF="201"/>
clover happen to be a scanty crop the second year,
it encourages weeds no less than a scanty crop of
pease.</P>
<P>I venture to suggest a better plan for hay than
any I have read of. I pronounce the best hay for
horses to be a mixture of ryegrass and yellow clo∣ver,
which flower together, and are fit to be cut
for hay the beginning of June, when still in
flower and the seed not formed: at that time, be∣ing
full of sap, they, are in perfection for hay.
When cut so early, they grow again vigorously,
and afford a second crop end of September; or
excellent pasture, if the season be unfavourable
for hay. When the first cutting is later than be∣ginning
of June, the stem turns dry and woody;
and much of it is rejected, if a horse be not ex∣tremely
hungry. But I recommend this to gen∣tlemen
only and farmers, for feeding their own
horses. In the view to sell hay, their profit I ac∣knowledge
will be greater in cutting when the seed
is ripe, because the seed is a profitable article.
The hay, it is true, separate from the seed, is no
better than straw: but that is no objection to a
stabler; for the less hay a travelling horse con∣sumes,
his profit is the greater. My reason for
chusing these two plants for hay to horses is, that,
of all leguminous plants, yellow clover approaches
the nearest in solidity to ryegrass, and that they
dry well together. Ribwort is left out, as being
less fit for horses; and where plenty of seed is
<PB N="176" REF="202"/>
given, the two plants chosen will make as weighty
a crop as the ground can bear. Three wheat-fir∣lots
of ryegrass, and ten pounds of yellow clover,
make a sufficient doze for an acre. And when
cut early, as it ought to be, the crop must be
very weighty if the cutting cost more than eigh∣teen
pence per acre.</P>
<P>For hay to horned cattle, the mixture ought to
be red clover, yellow clover, and ribwort. Red
clover, it is true, falls properly to be cut a little
later than the other two; but as it is choice food
for horned cattle, it is better to submit to a small∣er
quantity, than to lose the foggage of the other
plants by cutting them too late. Ten pounds
red clover, as much ribwort, and four pounds
yellow clover, are sufficient for an acre.</P>
<P>A farm horse during winter requires at least
two lippies of oats daily in spring, which affords
more working hours, they are encreased <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p there.
The rest of his food is hay or straw: bean-straw
is the best, pease-straw next, and after it good
oat-straw. Upon that food, a pair of good hor∣ses
will labour ten hours a-day, and plough an
acre of cultivated land; or draw on a smooth road
a hundred stone in a cart, sixteen English miles.
Such work they can perform daily without losing
flesh.</P>
<P>When too much hay or corn is given to a horse
at once, he eats greedily, and is apt to surfeit on
it. On this account, as well as to save food, bet∣ter
<PB N="177" REF="203"/>
to give it in small parcels at intervals, in which
case every particle will be eat up clean. Were it
not for the expence, the best way of feeding a
horse with hay would be, to give it out of the
hand. As for corn, a horse, when hungry, is apt
to swallow it without chewing; in which case it
passes entire without affording nourishment.
Therefore with oats mix chaff or cut straw, which
require chewing. If that labour be grudged,
there is an instrument contrived for bruising oats,
which has a promising appearance. I will not,
however, venture to recommend it, because I
have not experienced it.</P>
<P>A dairy may be turned to great account. A
good cow, during the six summer-months, will
give at a medium twelve Scotch pints of milk
daily; the butter of which, with the skimmed
milk, may amount to eighteen pence per day, and
thirteen pounds ten shillings in the six months.
The grasing of such a cow for that time will not
cost above forty shillings, which makes eleven
pounds ten shillings of profit.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>3. FEEDING FOR THE BUTCHER.</HEAD>
<P>HORNED cattle continue to grow till they are
full six years old; during which time they do not
readily take on fat, nor carry much tallow. The
proper time to enter them upon fattening food, is
at the age of seven. There is an additional rea∣son,
<PB N="178" REF="204"/>
that three years work can be got from them,
which in all events will do more than balance the
expence of their food.</P>
<P>As the demand for butcher-meat in Scotland
increases rapidly, the feeding cattle for the sham∣bles
has become an interesting article to the far∣mer.
Thirty years ago, he had no temptation to
keep fat on his cattle during winter, because there
was nothing but salt meat during winter and
spring. We have now fresh meat in plenty, all the
year round; only a little dearer in spring; and of
that circumstance a provident farmer will avail
himself. The difference of a month, will some∣times
add a halfpenny to every pound of beef;
which, upon an ox of sixty stone, makes forty
shillings for that month's feeding.</P>
<P>A field sown with the grasses above mentioned,
may be depended on for fattening from the middle
of April, in a warm soil, till the middle of No∣vember:
nor will they fall off till the middle of
December, if frost and snow keep away. Hay,
though greatly preferable to straw of any kind,
yet will not fatten horned cattle for the market
without green food. It indeed keeps the fat up∣on
them; but adds little or none. It is however
profitable to feed a fat ox with hay during win∣ter;
because the additional price got in the spring,
will defray the expence of the hay. Some years
ago, I fed twelve oxen with hay through winter;
and though they were not a pound heavier in A∣pril,
<PB N="179" REF="205"/>
I sold them at that time for double the sum
I paid for them. An ox of a middling size, eats
thirty pounds of hay, Dutch weight, in twenty-four
hours, and drinks forty-eight Scotch pints
of water. An ox of a large size will eat forty
pounds, and will drink in proportion.</P>
<P>Of all the beasts I know, a spaved quey is the
most profitable both for labour and for the butch∣er.
She is little inferior to an ox in strength; but
much more agile, and consequently better fitted
for travel. She will work even till eight years
old, and still be fit for feeding fat. People of
delicate taste prefer that sort of beef.</P>
<P>It is a great loss to have a cow to maintain that
has missed calf. The only profit is to feed her
for the butcher. She feeds the faster after ha∣ving
received the bull. But care must be taken
not to admit the bull, but so as that she may be
sold fat three months before the time of calving;
for during these three months she commonly loses
fat.</P>
<P>Considerable profit may be made by feeding
small cattle bred in the Highlands, purchased
when four years old at a small price, because they
are unfit for work. This branch of commerce is
accordingly well understood.</P>
<P>A sow is a profitable animal: it feeds greedily
on cut clover; which, with the offals of the kit∣chen,
dairy, and barn, prepare it finely for being
fatted in a short time with more nourishing food.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="206"/>
The feeding of calves for veal is also profitable.
The calf even of a middle-sized cow, after sucking
her for six weeks, will sell at a guinea. The
same cow will in six months feed four calves for
the butcher, sometimes more; and after all, will
give milk two months longer. For making fine
veal, the calf ought to be blooded frequently,
kept from light, laid clean and dry, and get chalk
to lick.</P>
<P>For some years past, a shed erected upon pillars,
with intervals of eight or ten feet, has been used
for stall-feeding. Such a shed I pronounce to be
too cold for our climate. A house so constructed,
as to avoid the extremities of heat and cold, an∣swers
much better. Upon a feed of turnip in
hard frost, cattle may be observed to contract
their feet together, and to tremble as in an ague.
No animal can feed well in distress. On the o∣ther
hand, cattle in a close house, and in a hot
day, may be observed panting for want of breath.
Therefore let the feeding-house have many win∣dows
or air-holes, to be shut or opened as occa∣sion
requires.</P>
<P>As to the time of housing cattle for feeding, it
is evident, that as grass is more easily raised than
cabbage or turnip, the longer stall-feeding is de∣layed
without losing fat, the better for the farmer.</P>
<P>With respect to the food proper for stall-feed∣ing,
turnip, cabbage, colewort, potatoes, carrot,
are all proper, and may be raised in every farm.
<PB N="181" REF="207"/>
For feeding in perfection, all of them ought to be
provided; for which there is more than one rea∣son.
In the first place, variety excites the appe∣tite:
next, some of these vegetables endure the
winter better than others: turnip, for example,
does not answer for spring-food, so well as cabbage
and colewort. Therefore, as far as is consistent
with variety, I would be sparing of the vegetables
that are the least hurt by winter. Potatoes an∣swer
best for the concluding food. If sufficient
store be provided, and well preserved, which is an
easy matter, all complaints of wanting green food
in spring must be at an end. Every animal is
fond of potatoes, not even excepting a horse.
They are a choice food for milk-cows, and pro∣duce
plenty of milk; which has no rank taste
more than where fed on hay or grass. And
yet after all, how many indolent farmers still
remain, who for want of spring-food are forced to
turn their cattle out to grass, before it is ready for
pasture; which not only starves the cattle, but
lays the grass-roots open to be parched by sun
and wind. One precaution, however, is necessary
with respect to grass in proper condition for pa∣sture
surrender is not to the cattle at once, which
would give a looseness, but for a few days let
them feed an hour or two only.</P>
<P>Preparatory to the feeding cattle in the house
with cabbage and turnip, they ought to be made
acquainted with that food in the field, by getting
<PB N="182" REF="208"/>
now and then small feeds of it; beginning with
cabbage, which they soon take to as being soft,
and then proceeding to turnip. Without being
thus prepared, some beasts have been known to
fast obstinately for days, before they would touch
them. In the house, it is common to fill the stalls
at once for saving trouble. This is wrong: cat∣tle
are so fond of cabbage and turnip after ac∣quaintance,
as to be apt to surfeit upon them. A
hungry horse, by eating too much corn at a time,
takes a loathing of that food; and his loathing
continues for days. Begin with giving a bullock
one turnip after another, and he will not readily
surfeit. One bullock of ninety stone Dutch thus
fed, ate up thirteen Dutch stone before he stop∣ped;
and in twenty-four hours he devoured thir∣ty
stone. This was the third part of his own
weight; and every bullock in health will do the
same, when thus fed. Therefore, after cleaning
the turnip, let the feeder begin in the morning
with throwing a turnip or two to every bullock,
one after another: let him repeat the dose till
they turn shy: let him then give them cabbage in
the same manner; and conclude with handfuls of
hay. When they are thus satisfied, prepare them
a soft bed as an invitaion to lie down. Leave
them to chew the cud and sleep, till they rise of
their own accord. Repeat the dose as before,
As they grow fat, they will reject the coarser
parts of the food; which may be given to win∣terers,
<PB N="183" REF="209"/>
or to swine. If the turnip be large, there
is no danger of giving them whole. But they are
apt to choke upon small turnip; which therefore
must be cut into small bits that can be easily swal∣lowed.
A machine to bruise turnip for eating
would be a useful invention.</P>
<P>These instructions are calculated to make cattle
eat the greatest quantity possible; it being certain,
that the more a bullock eats with an appetite, the
sooner he grows fat. It is bad oeconomy to spare
food in this case: a certain quantity daily is re∣quisite
to preserve a beast from falling away; and
an addition is necessary to put fat on him. There∣fore
the sooner he is fatted, the greater propor∣tion
of what is necessary for bare maintenance, is
saved.</P>
<P>To keep cattle clean, and well littered, is to
them half food; and this may be easliy done in a
shed constructed as described above. Let them
be combed every day, washed with water every
week, and bled every month; for these all con∣tribute
to fattening.</P>
<P>Most of the cattle in this country sold to the
butcher, are fed upon grass, and sold in Novem∣ber
at two pence per pound, or two pence half-penny.
But as the profit here is very small, a
farmer who is studious of his interest, will have a
provision of cabbage and turnip for winter, in
order to sell his cattle at double price in spring.</P>
<P>It has become a pretty general practice, to feed
<PB N="184" REF="210"/>
cattle in the field with turnip, cabbage, and other
annual greens. There is not another way of fat∣tening
cattle so cheap; nor another way by which
so much dung can be raised in a farm. These
are important objects. But what I chiefly insist
on is, that there is not within the invention of
man, a more effectual method for improving a
gravelly or sandy soil. Nothing indeed is more
hurtful to clay or rank loam than poaching; but
the poaching a light soil takes away the pores,
makes the earth more compact, and more reten∣tive
of moisture. A crop of turnip or cabbage
on stiff land, ought not to be fed in the field; but
in a shed, such as above described, or in an ad∣jacent
dry field.</P>
<P>To be successful in this article, let cattle be
chosen that have been accustomed to run out in
winter. Cattle that have been always housed in
winter, are too tender for field-feeding: they will
never turn fat.</P>
<P>There requires more management in feeding
cattle with cabbage and turnip, in the field, than
is commonly practised. What must one think of
the slovently method of turning cattle into a tur∣nip-field,
to feed at random? I hope this is rare;
but another method is not rare, which is, to in∣close
with flakes a portion of the field, and with∣in
that small space to confine the cattle. Is it not
obvious, that by dunging, pissng, trampling, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
great part of the turnip must be lost, or become
<PB N="185" REF="211"/>
nauseous? To prevent that loss, I have always
practised the following method. Supposing the
inclosure to be an oblong square, which is the
most convenient for flakes, begin at one of the
short sides, and from the fence throw the turnip
towards the middle of the field, clearing as much
ground as can be done at one throw, which may
be thirteen or fourteen feet. Separate this vacant
space from the turnip by flakes. Let the flakes
incline inward to the field, which will prevent the
cattle from rubbing them down. Introduce the
cattle into this void space, and begin with throw∣ing
over to them, from time to time, the turnip
that were taken up, so sparingly that they may
eat without trampling them under foot. After
these are clean eat up, clear another strip of the
same breadth with the former, by throwing over
to the cattle <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that growth <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Remove
the flakes to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the growing turnip, and
go on till the field be eat up. In this manner the
whole field with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad and poached, so as total∣ly
to alter the texture of the soil. But because to
give the cattle no other bed, would greatyy retard
the progre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of fattening; an adjacent grass-field is

heck<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for feeding the cattle with hay or straw;
as nothing contributes more to expeditious fat∣ning,
than alternate green and dry food.</P>
<P>Frost is the only enemy to this manner of feed∣ing.
<PB N="186" REF="212"/>
In frost, the digging up the turnip is expen∣sive;
and they give the cattle a looseness, which
makes them lean instead of fat. Hard frost de∣stroys
the turnip altogether. I have tried several
preventives. At the corner of a field, I built in
a stack all the turnip that grew on four acres.
They remained entire six weeks; but after that
time, they began to sprout, especially about the
centre, which exhausted the turnip, and rendered
them less palatable. I tried another method;
which was, to fill a large house with turnip, on the
first appearance of frost. The warmth of the
house made them sprout sooner than in the for∣mer
way. I made a third experiment; which
was, to dig a pit in the field six or seven feet deep,
where I stowed the turnip and covered them with
three feet of earth, reckoning that this would
prevent vegetation. But they sprouted as soon as
in the house. A fourth experiment was, to build
in the field what would fill two large carts, co∣vering
the heap with ferns or straw. In this si∣tuation,
they were longer of sprouting; but they
were more exposed to frost. Upon the whole,
the best method, as appears to me, is to store up
in a house as many turnip as will serve the cattle
a fortnight. Because after that time they begin to
wither, give them to the cattle though the wea∣ther
be fresh; and then fill the house again. This
is a resource against a fortnight's frost; and as a
farther resource, a few heaps may be collected in
<PB N="187" REF="213"/>
the field, ready at hand if frost set in. The same
method may be taken with cabbage. Carrots
are preserved by taking them up, and burying
them in sand. Potatoes being more hurt by frost
than any other root, they ought to be stored up
in a house, and covered with dry straw pressed
down with litter. But here a precaution is neces∣sary.
If allowed to lie too long in their winter∣quarters,
they will sprout, and be useless. There∣fore,
as soon as the frost is over in spring, they
must be exposed to the sun and air till perfectly
dry; and then laid up where there is a free cir∣culation
of air.</P>
<P>Cabbage and turnip give a strong taste to but∣cher-meat,
especially when not intermixed with
dry food. But the remedy is easy: give nothing
but dry food for a few days before they are de∣livered
to the butcher. The intermixing dry food
with turnip and cabbage in feeding milk-cows,
ought never to be omitted; because these plants
alone give a nauseous taste to the milk, cream,
and butter.</P>
<P>The feeding cattle with turnip and cabbage in
the field, is an interesting article. There are few
farms but what are fit for raising green food of
one kind or other; and by far the greater part
are fit for every kind. Light soil is fit for turnip,
both light and loamy soil for potatoes, deep soil
for carrots, and stong soil for cabbage. For a
dozen of years back, the ordinary profit of such
<PB N="188" REF="214"/>
feeding from the end of November to the end
of March, has been to double the price of the
cattle; which affords a very handsome rent for
the land. Nor do I reckon this the capital part:
the gain is still greater by the improvement of the
soil. No other method is so effectual to convert
light porous soil into what is firm and heavy, than
the poaching of cattle during winter. To compare
it with a manure that is exhausted by cropping,
would not do it justice. It alters and improves
the soil like clay-marl; and these two are the
only means I am acquainted with, to produce a
new soil equal to one originally rich. There are
few soils indeed but what may be hurt by crop∣ping;
but a soil so improved, can never be hurt
so much by cropping, as to be reduced to its ori∣ginal
poor state. After such a winter-feeding, it
would surprise one, to find ground formerly so loose
as not to hold together, become now so solid as
to be raised by the plough in solid masses. This
way of feeding cattle, is at the same time a good
dunging to the field, equal at least to an ordi∣nary
dunging from a dunghill. The cattle eva∣cuate
abundantly, and what drops from them
mixes intimately with the soil: not a particle is
lost.</P>
<P>The feeding sheep on turnip and cabbage ought
to be delayed as long as possible, for the reason
given above with respect to horned cattle. But
as sheep are better protected against cold, there
<PB N="189" REF="215"/>
is the less necessity of providing a shed for them.
To save the turnip, flakes ought to be used; and
a dry bed is still more necessary to them than to
horned cattle. Their dry food ought to be white-clover
hay, or unthreshed fitches; both of which
they delight in. White-clover hay, however,
without corn or green food, will not fatten sheep
for the butcher. In frost and snow, sheep should
always be supplied with hay or other dry food;
which prepares them for gree food the end of
March; at which time a few weeks of ryegrass
will make them ready for the market, at the dear∣est
time of the year.</P>
<P>Where sheep are fed in the house, which is sel∣dom
done except for the use of a family, they
ought to be separated by rails from each other;
otherwise the strongest wedder will oppress the
rest. They must be shorn when put up to feed,
and be always kept clean. There must be a neck
for holding hay, a place for the turnip or cabbage,
and a rip of oats be hung up within their reach.
A sheep, like an ox, eats of turnip the third of its
own weight in twenty-four hours. The best age
for feeding weathers is four or five: short of that
age they feed not so kindly, nor tallow so well.</P>
<P>Some land is fitted for feeding; some for breed∣ing
only. A farmer who possesses rich land, buys
lean cattle from the breeder, and fattens them for
the butcher.</P>

<HEAD>4. THE WINTERING OF CATTLE NOT IN∣TENDED
FOR IMMEDIATE SALE.</HEAD>
<P>THE food proper for such cattle is, first, coarse
grass that they refuse to eat during summer, when
they have better food. Second, straw or coarse
hay; and, last, what is left by milk-cows, by
beasts stall-fed, or by working oxen and horses.
With respect to the first, the common but very
improper method is, to let them go at large in
the field; and in frost and snow to give them
food in hecks. By this method, the dung is al∣most
entirely lost, and unless the field happen to
be well sheltered, which seldom is the case, Scot∣land
is a climate too cold for such management.
This is verified in our highland cattle, which ne∣ver
arrive at half their size; not so much from
want of food, as from piercing cold in a moun∣tainous
country. To remedy both these evils, an
open shed should be erected in the field, for shelter
to the cattle in a storm; and this shed should be
in the most sheltered spot, fronting the south. To
preserve the food given them during frost and
snow, a heck should be put up in the shed; and
the dung be carefully collected from time to time.
It is evident from what is said, that no cattle are
fit to be managed in this manner, but what have
been accustomed to lie out all winter.</P>
<P>Where there is no coarse grass for winter-feed∣ing,
<PB N="191" REF="217"/>
the ordinary method to feed winterers is in
a dung-yard with straw, the half of which, trod∣den
down with the foot, turns to no account.
The more provident farmers set up a heck in the
yard, which saves some of the straw that is lost
the other way.</P>
<P>This method, though common, lies open to
many objections: first, it is still too cold for win∣ter;
next, much good food is destroyed by it;
and, third, the dung, by trampling of the cattle,
is kept from rotting. This matter is interesting,
and I beg the reader's attention, while I endea∣vour
to verify these propositions. With respect
to the first, the shelter of a yard is far from being
sufficient to preserve cattle in a kindly heat, du∣ring
frosty weather. Such an inclosure is subject
to whirling winds, which pinch the cattle even in
fresh weather. Observe, that when cattle are
brought from a warmer climate to mend the
breed, every one is sensible, that during winter a
warm house, and plenty of food, should be pro∣vided
for them. A cow when thus treated gives
more milk, and a beast intended for the butcher
goes sooner to fat. To answer these purposes, I
believe it will be found, that the nearer the air
approaches to the heat of the blood, the cattle
will thrive the better. That cattle fed in a yard
destroy much straw, is obvious to ocular inspec∣tion.
Even when straw is put into a heck, one
be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st no sooner draws out a mouthful, than he is
<PB N="192" REF="218"/>
pushed away by another, and loses in his hurry
part of what he draws from the heck: none of
them are suffered to feed peaceably or quietly.
The third proposition is the most important of all.
Half-rotten dung trodden under foot, and knead∣ed
together by the cattle, excludes the air totally
from the inner parts of the heap; and it is a truth
indisputable, that there never can be any putre∣faction
where there is no air. Putrefaction can∣not
go on without moisture, and as little without
air. Put a spoonful of cream in an exhausted re∣ceiver;
and after a year it will come out as
sweet as when put in. When a dunghill, after
heating, turns cool again, turn it over and admit
fresh air, it heats a second time: a stake driven
into an open gravelly soil, which admits air into
every pore, rots sooner than even in a wet clay-soil
that excludes air.</P>
<P>From these premisses I conclude with firmness,
that the best way of feeding winterers is in a
house where there is free ventilation; indulging
them only an hour or two in the field when let
out to water, more or less according to the wea∣ther.
I know many judicious farmers, who pre∣fer
the feeding on a dunghill, with an open shed
to retire to in a storm; and they even hold, that
the treading of cattle on a dunghill contributes to
its putrefaction. I flatter myself that I have dis∣covered
the reason of this opinion. The practice
is, to throw quantities of dry straw from time to
<PB N="193" REF="219"/>
time on the dunghill, part of which is eaten by
the cattle, and the rest trodden under foot.
Straw is elastic, and when laid on a dunghill dry,
it admits too much air; in which case the dung∣hill
gains by being trodden on. But where all
the straw is used, either in food or in litter,
and none of it carried to the dunghill till it be half
putrefied; it claps close enough of itself; it be∣comes
too compact by being trodden upon; and
the air is excluded altogether, which obstructs
putrefaction no less than too much air. A pro∣vident
farmer will never waste his straw, by throw∣ing
it on a dunghill: he will provide as many
winterers, as to consume all the straw that is to
spare from his working cattle. I add, that sup∣posing
winterers to be as comfortably put up in a
farm-yard as in a house, the latter however ought
to be preferred; first, because it saves straw, and
the beasts are more regularly fed; next, that it
is a better way of having a dunghill well putre∣fied;
and, lastly, that the piss of the cattle can
be wholly preserved; whereas in a farm-yard all
is lost but what happens to fall on the dunghill.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>5. RULES FOR BUYING AND SELLING CAT∣TLE
AND CORN.</HEAD>
<P>THE common and constant way is, to fell cattle by
the eye; which is far from being equal between
the farmer and the butcher. The former has but
<PB N="194" REF="220"/>
a very uncertain guess of the weight; the latter,
who is dealing the year round, can guess very
near. Fair commerce is in general the most be∣neficial;
and every thing that approaches to
chance or gaming is hurtful. To bring on a per∣fect
equality between the seller and buyer, I pro∣pose,
that every beast should be sold by weight,
and that the weight should be ascertained by a ba∣lance.
The most convenient one I know is a
steel-yard, being the fittest for weighing heavy
goods; and a steel-yard I have used with ease and
success many years.</P>
<P>But it is not sufficient to have the weight of a
living beast ascertained. Different parts are very
different in their value; and there is a rule for
ascertaining the proportion of these different parts,
by which their weight may be known, almost
with equal certainty as the weight of the whole
beast. My experience goes no farther than to
Scotch cattle sold fat, to which the following
proportions will nearly answer. The four quar∣ters
make the half of the weight of the bullock.
The skin is the eighteenth part. The tallow the
twelfth part. These make twenty three thirty-sixths
of the whole; and the head, feet, tripe,
blood, &amp;c. make the remainder, being a third
part and a little more. These offals never sell by
weight, but at a certain proportion of the weight
of the beast. They commonly draw ten shillings
<PB N="195" REF="221"/>
and sixpence when the bullock weighs a hundred
stone Dutch; and so in proportion.</P>
<P>These particulars adjusted, the next thing the
seller is to inform himself of, is the price of but∣cher-meat
in the market, of tallow, and of hides.
Supposing the bullock I have to sell is seventy-two
stone living weight, the four quarters make thir∣ty-six
stone, which at 4 s. per stone, or 3 d. per
pound, amount to L. 7, 4 s. The hide is worth
16 s. at 4 s. per stone; and the tallow, be∣ing
5 s. 4 d. the stone, is worth L. 1, 12 s.
Sterling. The offals, according to the proportion
above mentioned, will give 7 s. 6 d.; and by that
computation the value of the bullock is L. 9,
19 s. 6 d. This answers to 2 s. 9 9/12 d. per stone
living weight. And therefore, if the butcher a∣gree
to give me that sum per stone, no more is
necessary to ascertain the price of the whole car∣go,
than to weigh the beasts by threes or fours as
the scale can hold them. Out of this sum how∣ever
must be deducted the butcher's profit, which
cannot be much less than 5 per cent.</P>
<P>The weighing cattle alive answers another im∣portant
purpose; which is, to discover whether
the feeder gets the value of the food by the ad∣ditional
weight of the beast. For example, the
food of a bullock costs 9 d. per day, or 5 s. 3 d.
per week. If the bullock do not take on two
stone per week, the keeper is a loser; and there
<PB N="196" REF="222"/>
is no excuse for keeping the beast on hand, un∣less
perhaps in expectation of a rising market.</P>
<P>There is another advantage of regulating the
price of cattle by living weight. Where a but∣cher
buys by the lump, and bargains that he is to
take away the beast at a day certain, the vender
is tempted to be sparing of food. But supposing
the beast to be sold by living weight, it is the in∣terest
of the seller to make it as fat as possible.</P>
<P>The same rule in selling is applicable to sheep.
The four quarters make half of the living weight,
the skin the eleventh part, the tallow the tenth
part, the offals somewhat less than the third
part. But computing the prices that these parti∣culars
sell for in the market, the amount will not
be the value of the sheep, because the wool also
must be taken under consideration. The wool
from shearing-time to Lammas is of little value.
At the end of December the value is the half of a
full-grown fleece. A Linton, Ochill, or Lam∣mermuir
wedder, at the age of four, carries a
fleece weighing at a medium two pounds eight
ounces, valued at 9 d. per pound when not tar∣red,
which makes the value of a fleece at clip∣ping-time,
1 s. 10 6/12 d. Sterling. At the end of
December it is 11 9/12 d.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>As the wool of sheep degenerates into hair in both ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>remes of heat and cold, smearing is a remedy in a cold climate. It also kills vermin, and makes a sheep take on fat five or six weeks sooner than it would do o∣therwise. Some miles round Cheviot hills, none but sheep of a year old are smeared: elder sheep are reckon∣ed sufficiently strong to endure the cold without it. But there black sheep of all ages are smeared, because black wool is not discoloured by smearing. In the north of Scotland smearing is not known.</P>
<P>Wool shorn immediately after a sheep is washed, ne∣ver turns white. A kind of oil, termed <HI>gleet,</HI> perspires from the animal, and contributes to whiten the wool in scouring. Therefore, where washing is necessary, delay shearing for a fortnight, that the wool may again be covered with gleet.</P></NOTE>. Thus having a score
<PB N="197" REF="223"/>
of wedders to sell at the end of December, each
of which weighs six stone fourteen pounds Dutch
weight, I want to know what they are worth per
head.</P>

<P>This price answers to 2 s. 11 6/12 d. Sterling per

stone living weight. And if the butcher agree
to give that price, the value of any particular
beast may be determined by weighing him as a∣bove.</P>
<P>From this must be deducted the butcher's pro∣fit
at 5 per cent. or under, as can be agreed.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> An animal weighs more or less as his bel∣ly
is more or less full. The above proportions
were made out when the sheep and horned cattle
were weighed at eleven o'clock forenoon.</P>
<P>HAVING discussed cattle, I proceed to corn. The
variety of measures in selling and buying corn,
has been time out of mind a just cause of com∣plaint
in Scotland, as well as other countries; and
it is indeed an inlet to many frauds. And yet,
were all the measures used in Scotland reduced
to the Linlithgow standard, there would however
remain a great inconvenience in selling grain by
measure; for of all commodities, it is the least
proper to be sold in that manner. The quality of
grain differs widely in different soils, and even in
the same soil by good or bad culture. One boll
of barley weighs twenty-one Dutch stone, another
only fifteen. One boll of oats weighs fifteen
stone, another, only eleven. The same difference
is observable in other grain.</P>
<P>There is another objection against selling by
measure. The slovenly farmer is satisfied with
bulk, without any regard to the quality of his
<PB N="199" REF="225"/>
grain: whereas, were it the rule to sell by weight,
it would make the farmer doubly attentive to the
dressing of his land, in order to produce the
weightiest grain.</P>
<P>Beside weight, another circumstance enters in∣to
consideration for ascertaining the value of grain;
which is, the proportion of the husk to the ker∣nel.</P>
<P>Middling wheat weighs per boll fourteen Dutch
stone; of which the husk makes the seventh part,

<HEAD TYPE="sub">FOREST-TREES.</HEAD>
<P>CONSIDERING the great quantity of waste land
in Scotland, fit only for bearing trees, and the
easiness of transporting them by navigable arms of
the sea, one cannot but regret the indolence of
our forefathers, who neglected that profitable
branch of commerce, and left us to the necessity
of purchasing foreign timber for every use in life.
The Commissioners of the annexed estates, deeply
sensible of this neglect, have bestowed liberally
to raise plantations every where in the King's e∣states.
Their laudable example has animated
many land-proprietors, to benefit themselves and
their country by the same means. The spirit of
<PB N="201" REF="227"/>
planting is roused; and there seems little doubt
of its spreading wider and wider, till this country
be provided with timber for its own consumpt
at least, if not for exportation. As an author, I
am fond to do all in my power to keep up that
spirit: and in that view, the present chapter on
the culture of forest-trees, will, I hope, be well
received. A regular treatise upon the subject
would require a volume: but as I must contract
what I have to say within the nutshell of a chap∣ter,
I shall study brevity, and mention nothing
but what appears material.</P>
<P>Trees are propagated by seed, by cuttings, by
layers, and by suckers.</P>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>1. RAISING TREES BY SEED.</HEAD>
<P>THE propagating trees by seed is nature's me∣thod.
One inconvenience it has, that the trees
thus raised are not always the same with the pa∣rent
plant: though they are of the same species,
they copy not always its varieties.</P>
<P>What follows will enable us to judge of the
maturity of seed. Seed inclosed in a <HI>capsula,</HI> in
a pod, or in a cone, is ripe when the covering
opens by the heat of the sun. The seed of a
fruit-tree is ripe when it no longer adheres to the
fruit; and where unripe fruit is pulled, the seed
ripens with it. In general, seed is ripe when it
sinks in water to the bottom.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="228"/>
The seed of the Scotch elm ripens before the
middle of June. The best way of gathering it is,
to shake the tree gently: the ripest seed falls first,
which may be gathered in a sheet laid at the root
of the tree.</P>
<P>The seed of the ash and of the maple may be
put into the ground without being taken out of
its <HI>capsula.</HI></P>
<P>The best way of opening the cones of pine, sir,
&amp;c. is to expose them in boxes to sun and dew.
The drying them in a kiln is apt to destroy the
germ. The cones of the larix are at their full
size in autumn; but the seed is not so early ripe.
Delay gathering them till March or April, when
they begin to drop from the tree. Cut off a part
of the cone next the stalk, which will render it
easy to separate the quarters: the ripest seed falls
out upon shaking the cone with the hand.</P>
<P>The seed of the birch, the willow, the poplar,
the aller, being very small, is not easily gathered:
stir the ground about these trees, and it will soon
be filled with young plants. With respect to the
seed of the birch and ash, it is singular, that when
dropt from the tree, no seed takes root so readily;
yet when gathered, and scattered with the hand, it
seldom grows.</P>
<P>As for a choice of seed, small acorns gathered
from large and lofty trees, are preferable before
the largest acorns of smaller trees. In general,
the seed is always the best that is procured from
<PB N="203" REF="229"/>
the most vigorous trees. But as in extensive
plantations much precision cannot be expected, it
ought to be the chief care that the seed be per∣fectly
sound.</P>
<P>Next, as to preparing seed for sowing. Trees
propagated from seed have all of them a tap-root,
which pushes perpendicularly downward. The
purpose of nature in this root is, to fit trees for
growing in the slissest soil, and to secure them a∣gainst
wind; but it proves hurtful to trees intend∣ed
for transplantation. A young oak five or six
years old, when taken up for transplanting, has,
like a turnip, but this single root, which will be
four or five feet long when the stem is within one
foot. Planted in this manner, it seldom lives.
This evil is prevented by making the seed germi∣nate
in moist earth, and sowing it in the seed∣bed
after the radicle is cut off. The radicle never
pushes more; and instead of it the tree pushes
out many roots, which spread horizontally. Wal∣nuts,
almonds, and other shell-fruit, being long
of germinating, ought to be put in moist sand, in
order that the radicle may push before the end of
April, to be cut off as aforesaid. Acorns, Chef∣nuts,
and beech-mast, will germinate timeously
in dry sand. In wet sand or moist earth, they
would, before the time of sowing, not only ger∣minate,
but push out long roots, which would
ruin all. As this method is too troublesome for
small seeds, sow them in beds as gathered: pull
<PB N="204" REF="230"/>
them up the second year: cut off the tap-roots:
and plant them again at the distance from each o∣ther
of three or four inches. Two years after,
they may again be transplanted wider; there to
remain till they be fit for the field. Some imagine,
that to deprive a tree of the tap-root prevents its
growth. But experience vouches the contrary;
and so does reason. It is observable, that the
roots next the sursace, being accessible to sun and
moisture, are always the most vigorous, and are
farther spread than those below. A tap-root is de∣prived
of sun and air, and even of water, unless
where it happens to glide below the surface; how
then can it equal a horizontal root in nourishing
the tree.</P>
<P>The seeds of the white thorn sown without pre∣paration,
rise not till the second year. If buried
under ground in a heap till the pulp be rotted off,
and sown in the spring following, they will germi∣nate
that very year. Instead of burying them under
ground, a more approved method is, to lay them
in a heap at the end of a barn, mixed with earth.
By that method, a greater number will germinate
than in the ordinary way. I made an experiment.
One bed was sown with haws prepared in the or∣dinary
way; and one with haws prepared in the
other way. Upon the latter bed sprung a double
quantity of thorns, and more vigorous. I made
another experiment upon elm-seed. Of a quan∣tity
gathered when ripe, the half was immediate∣ly
<PB N="205" REF="231"/>
sown; the other half was carefully dried in the
shade, and sown a fortnight after. The latter
produced a greater number of plants, and more
vigorous. Thorns are propagated still more ex∣peditiously
by cuttings from the root. When
thorns are taken from the nursery to be planted
in a hedge, the roots that are either wounded by
the spade, or too long, must be cut off. Let these
be shred into small parts, and sown in a bed pre∣pared
for them: they will produce thorns that
very year. The seed of the ash seldom germi∣nates
till the second year. When gathered in the
month of October, let it be put in pots with earth,
and sown in the spring: it will germinate imme∣diately.
The ordinary way of raising hollies, is
to sow the berries entire; which is wrong: every
berry contains four seeds; and the plants that
spring from them are so interwoven, as not to be
separable without injury. A better way is, to ga∣ther
the berries in December, the later the better
if they can be saved from birds. Throw them
into a tub with water, and between the hands
rub them carefully in the water till all the pulp
fall off. The good seed will sink to the bottom,
which, after the water is poured off, must be laid
upon a cloth to dry. Mix them with dry sand,
which will preserve them all winter. Sow them
in March or April, and cover them with earth a∣bout
three quarters of an inch thick.</P>
<P>With respect to the time of sowing, the best
<PB N="206" REF="232"/>
rule is, to imitate nature, by sowing when the seed
is ripe; provided the tree be of a hardy kind to
endure the frost of winter. By this rule, the seed
of Scotch elm ought to be sown in June; the seed
of pine and fir in April, at which time their cones
open. Acorns, chesnuts, and beech-mast, ripen
in autumn, which is the time of sowing them.
If they ripen later, it is more safe to sow them in
the spring following; because the young plants
cannot resist frost, if before winter they have not
acquired some degree of vigour. There is an∣other
reason for storing up these seeds till spring;
which is, that the longer they lie in the ground,
the greater risk they run of being destroyed by
vermin. As the white thorn vegetates early, the
haws ought to be sown the first dry weather in
February, after being separated by a wire-sieve
from the mould with which they were mixed.
Avoid fresh dung, which is injurious to them.
Sow the seed of the larix when taken out of the
cone in March or April; for though in the cone
it will stand good for years, yet it does not long
retain its vegetative quality when separated from
the cone.</P>
<P>Next as to the manner of sowing seed. Nature
drops seed upon the surface of the ground. We
must depart from nature in this instance, upon the
following account, that after much expence and
trouble in procuring seed, the far greater part
would perish, partly by vermin, and partly by
<PB N="207" REF="233"/>
an inclement air. This is not regarded by na∣ture,
which is profuse in the production of seed.
All seeds therefore ought to be covered with earth,
birch-seed alone excepted, which ought to be
pressed down with the back of the spade, but left
open to the air without covering. Small seeds
must be slightly covered, as having less vigour to
push upward. In strong soil, the covering ought
in every case to be slight. The depth is pretty
much arbitrary, because the same seed will thrive
at different depths. But it must be attended to,
that a slight covering exposes the seed to drought;
and therefore the ground ought to be watered if
the season be dry. Where the ground sown is
too extensive for watering, a crop of barley will
preserve the tree-seed from the sun, and also pre∣vent
weeds. The tree-seed and the barley may
be sown alternately in lines. If trees are intended
to remain where their seed is sown, it is proper to
sow thick, partly for shelter, partly to keep down
weeds. M. Buffon declares against weeding the
ground upon which the seed is sown: “For,”
says he, “weeds shelter the young plants from
the sun, keep in the dew, and preserve the
plants warm in winter.” In Scotland nothing
is more hurtful to plants than weeds, which choke
them, and exclude the air. A better way, even
in France, is to sow barley with the seed, which
will protect the young plants from the sun, and
admit the air.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="234"/>
The best way of preserving seed is in dry sand,
which sucks in the moisture from the seed, and
prevents mustiness. It withal retains so much
moisture as to prevent the seed from withering.
This method is chiefly useful in preserving during
winter seeds that require spring-sowing, and in
the conveyance of seeds to a distance. The effi∣cacy
of dry sand appears in preserving oranges and
citrons, which in the air dry and wither: if to
prevent withering they be laid in a moist place,
they never fail to turn musty. There is one ex∣ception,
that seed which lies long in the ground
before it germinates, ought to be preserved in
moist earth. The seed of the sensitive plant will
keep entire for twenty years; of a melon for
nine or ten. There are many seeds that will not
keep entire longer than two or three years; which
is the case of flax-seed, though remarkably oily:
some seeds require to be put in the ground as
soon as ripe.</P>
<P>To prevent young plants in the seed-bed from
being spewed out by frost, cover the beds with
leaves of trees, to be removed when the severe
frosts are over.</P>
<P>We proceed from the seed-bed to the nursery.
Plants form very different roots, according to the
soil they grow in. In stiff soil, the roots are com∣monly
few, but strong and vigorous, for over∣coming
the resistance of such a soil. Roots
multiply in proportion to the richness and mel∣lowness
<PB N="209" REF="235"/>
of a soil. An oak, for example, has
a strong tap-root, which fits it, more than any
other tree, for growing in a stiff soil. This
root diminishes in strength and size in a loam,
and still more in a sandy soil. When it grows
in water, it has a multitude of roots, but not
the least appearance of a tap-root. Hence it
follows, that the soil of a nursery ought always
to be light and free: such a soil produces a mul∣titude
of roots; and the vigour of growth is al∣ways
in proportion to the number of roots, the
smaller the better. But it also follows, that in
transplanting trees from such a nursery, the soil
about them ought to be made as mellow and free
as possible, in order to encourage the small roots.
When these are enlarged in so fine a soil, they
will be able to overcome the stiffness of the na∣tural
soil of the field. Avoid dung in a nursery. If
any be admitted, it ought to be thoroughly putre∣fied,
and digested into a sort of rich mould. Green
dung makes the roots ill conditioned, and encou∣rages
a large white worm, which lives on the bark
of the roots. Neither the walnut nor horse-ches∣nut
succeed in a nursery: the plants require to be
placed at a distance from each other; and the
earth about them must be stirred several years.
Aquatics that are intended to be propagated by
large cuttings, ought first to have the benefit of
a nursery; because they thrive best when planted
out with roots. Avoid a mixture of different
<PB N="210" REF="236"/>
trees in the same bed, for the slow growers will
be oppressed.</P>
<P>The true season for transplanting from the seed∣bed
to the nursery is about the fall of the leaf.
Catch the time when the earth is so moist as to
suffer the plants to be drawn without tearing the
roots. All evergreens ought to be transplanted in
spring; and also all other trees that suffer by
frost.</P>
<P>Where trees are so young as that an interval of
five or six inches along the rows is sufficient, there
must be an interval of a foot at least between the
rows, in order to give access to clean the ground
of weeds; and this interval is sufficient, even
when the plants are so large as to make an inter∣val
of a foot along the rows necessary. Where
the distance along the rows is made eighteen
inches, or two feet, the intervals between the
rows ought to be no less, for the sake of the trees,
though unnecessary for the sake of weeding. Yet
such is the influence of custom, contrary to com∣mon
sense, that from the original position of young
plants in a nursery, the interval between rows is
always made double of the interval along the
rows. Thus if the latter be eighteen inches, the
former is always made three feet; and four feet
where the size of the trees requires an interval of
two feet along the rows. The same influence of
custom occasions trees to be planted in rows in
the field, where they are to stand; and yet they
<PB N="211" REF="237"/>
make a much better figure when, in imitation of
nature, they are scattered as at random.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>2 CUTTINGS, LAYERS, SUCKERS.</HEAD>
<P>SEED is not the only means that nature has
provided for propagating trees. They can be pro∣pagated
by cuttings, by layers, and by suckers.
They have one advantage, that whereas seed pro∣pagates
the kind only, these carry on any variety
that is in the tree from whence they are taken.
Grafting had the same effect.</P>
<P>The willow, the osier, the vine, the elder, the
poplar both black and white, the platanus, the yew,
the box, may all be propagated by cuttings. The
black poplar is singular: a branch will not answer
for a cutting, unless the top be left entire. A
cutting of willow eight or ten feet long, and seven
or eight inches thick, planted in the following
manner, will soon become a tree. Let the great
end be immersed in water a foot deep as soon
as cut, which ought to be the end of March;
and remain in that state till planted, which ought
to be the beginning of May. Immediately before
planting, cut the great end sloping to a point;
and on the side that is not cut, keep the bark
entire down to the point. Make a hole in the
earth a foot and a half deep, sufficiently large to
admit the cutting without ruffling the bark, which
would prove destructive. Any vacuity left in the
<PB N="212" REF="238"/>
hole must be filled up with fresh earth, and pressed
down close to the cutting. A safer way, and little
less expeditious, is to make the hole with the
spade, to return the earth to the hole round the
cutting, and to press down all firm and close. After
standing a year, throw some fresh earth upon the
roots. It is still better, to make a ditch two feet
from the row of the trees thus planted, and to lay
upon the roots the earth of the ditch. Several
trees that can be propagated by cuttings, require
more precaution than the willow or poplar. The
branches intended for cuttings must be young;
and a part of the greater branch from whence
they are taken must be cut with them, to serve as
a sort of root. With all these precautions, it must
not be expected, that every cutting from the pla∣tanus,
the white poplar, the poplars of Virginia
and of Lombardy, the aspin, the maple with ash
leaves, will take root. Cuttings from the yew, the
alaternus, the box, require the utmost care. They
ought to be planted in beds sheltered from the
sun, and watered in dry weather.</P>
<P>All trees do by layers; and the method is easy
in shrubs which have branches near the ground:
but to propagate by layers from large trees that
have no branches near the ground, such as the
lime, the mulberry, the aller, more art is neces∣sary.
One method is, to cut the tree by the
ground before the sap begins to rise; which will
produce many shoots the first year. The next
<PB N="213" REF="239"/>
year at the same time, heap earth upon the root
till it rise a foot upon the shoots. After two or
three years remove the earth, and cut off the
stems, which will be full of roots as far as they
were covered with earth. These will make good
plants. Spare the smaller stems, and cover them
with earth as before: they will in time produce
new plants. Another method is, to chuse a
young tree eight or nine inches in circumference;
and cut it over two feet from the ground. In e∣very
part, the stump pushes many shoots. The
second or third year, take all out of the ground:
lay the stump with its roots and shoots in a
trench; and cover them with earth, so as to leave
nothing open to the air but the extremities of the
shoots. These will thrust out roots under the sur∣face,
which will afford young plants in abundance.
When a pine or a fir is cut down, the root dies
without producing any shoot. Nor can these trees
be propagated either by cuttings or by layers; if
a spruce <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be excepted, which it is said can be
propagated by cuttings.</P>
<P>To have straight trees, cuttings and layers
ought to be of perpendicular branches, especially
where the wood is hard. How long layers should
continue in the ground to have good roots, de∣pends
much upon the season, and still more on
the nature of the tree. A bramble will take root
on the surface of the ground, without the least
covering of earth. Layers of lime and of plata∣nus
<PB N="214" REF="240"/>
have commonly good roots in three years,
and sometimes in two. Many trees require long∣er
time.</P>
<P>To propagate by suckers, part of the root of
the parent plant must be cut along with the sucker.
It must be immediately planted in a nursery, in
order to acquire roots. When planted out to
stand, the old root should be cut away all but
what is close to the sucker; for it is apt to swell
under ground, and to obstruct the growth of the
plant. To have a quantity of suckers, which rise
not plentifully from old trees, cut the old tree o∣ver,
and the ground will be filled with them.
Some writers say, that trees propagated by layers
take on a better shape, and grow faster, than
those propagated by suckers.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>3. SOIL PROPER FOR TREES.</HEAD>
<P>THE soil proper for trees comes next in order.
Fat sand, that is, clay mixed with a large propor∣tion
of sand, agrees with almost every sort of tree,
especially if the soil be deep. Evergreens do well
in such a soil. And even aquatics, such as ash, pop∣lar,
willow, aller, thrive in it, though more slowly
than in moist ground: these aquatics make a shift
even in ground too dry for the oak, the beech,
the chesnut. A pine grows well in sand. The
juniper will grow in a very thin soil where scarce
any other tree will thrive. An aspin does well in
<PB N="215" REF="241"/>
a pure clay: a chesnut does not. Dry earth of a
good quality, though but eighteen inches above a
tough till, will bear the elm, the maple, the horn∣beam,
the walnut, the ash, the birch, the mul∣berry,
the white poplar, and almost every kind
of shrub. If but ten or twelve inches deep, it is
only fit for shrubs; excepting the birch, which
will grow if the till be covered with but five or
six inches of black and light earth. The lime
and the horse-chesnut love a tender and deep soil.
Marshy soil is proper for the willow, the ash, the
aller, the occidental platanus, and for most sorts
of the poplar. An elder, though it makes a shift
in the driest soil, yet loves moisture; and there∣fore
is proper for a fence on the sides of ditches,
for cattle do not touch it. Ground elevated two
or three feet above a running water, being moist
without being marshy, is fit for trees of every
sort, particularly for the occidental and oriental
platanus, the tulip-tree, and the lime. Young
trees should be planted differently, according to
the nature of the soil: in a soil retentive of moi∣sture,
the tree should be bulked above the sur∣face;
in a very dry soil, the earth round the tree
should slope down to the root, in order to collect
the rain. In general, though corn prospers in
clay, sandy or gravelly soil is fittest for trees.
The culture of corn, renewed annually, renders
clay open and free; but when left untilled, it
turns too hard even for the roots of trees.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<PB N="216" REF="242"/>
<HEAD>4. CLIMATE.</HEAD>
<P>WITH respect to climate, an oak is an inhabi∣tant
of the temperate zone: none are found be∣tween
the tropics, and none farther north than
Stockholm. Fir and birch bear much cold, the
latter especially. Plants, like animals, after se∣veral
generations, come to thrive in a climate very
different from their own. It requires peculiar
skill and attention to habituate to a new climate
such as grow on the top of the Alps, and on the
top of high mountains farther north. Their na∣ture
fits them for a very cold summer; and for a
temperate winter, being always covered with
snow during that season. In a low country the
want of snow can be tolerably well supplied by
some small degree of artificial heat; but in our
summers it is not easy to give them the cold of
their native place.</P>
<P>The advantages and disadvantages of different
exposures come under the present article. In
spring, even a strong frost hurts not plants, pro∣vided
the ice be melted before they are exposed
to the sun: but even a moderate frost commits
great waste, if the ice continue till it be melted by
the sun; for the ice acts as a burning-glass. By
that means, delicate plants, exposed to the rising
sun, are often destroyed in spring; while such
plants, exposed to the north, are safe: which is
<PB N="217" REF="243"/>
the fate even of young shoots of the oak. An
eastern exposition has, on the other hand, its ad∣vantages.
Plants are sooner relieved from the
morning cold by the heat of the sun: they are
protected from the sun's meridian heat: and as
the east wind is generally dry, spring-frost makes
less impression than where there is more moisture.</P>
<P>In a southern exposition, plants, being covered
from the north, are the less subject to frost. As
the sun reaches them not till about ten in the
morning, the spring ice is commonly melted be∣fore
that time; and if the climate be rainy to
temper the meridian heat, trees in that exposure
grow fast. The disadvantage is, at first, that
young plants are apt to be scorched by the sun,
especially in a light soil and dry summer; and
next, that ice being frequently melted in that ex∣posure,
even by winter-heat; if the moisture be
not sucked up by heat or dissipated by wind, it is
congealed in the evening, and does much hurt.</P>
<P>A western exposition is free from the burning
sun in a dry season; but is exposed to spring snow
and hail, which come mostly from the west. We
often feel a west exposition insupportably cold,
when the air is tolerably soft in other expositions.
Hardy trees can bear this cold; but tender trees
are often destroyed by it.</P>
<P>In a northern exposition, snow never melts;
and the wind from that quarter is the coldest and
driest of all. By that means however perspiration
<PB N="218" REF="244"/>
is so faint, that little moisture is required. Here
deciduous forest-trees grow slowly; but the pine,
the fir, the yew, the evergreen oak, the box, and
other evergreens, thrive well. This fact appears
singular: evergreens perspire little; and one
would think that they should, more than other
trees, need the action of the sun to keep their
sap in motion. The birch also thrives well in a
northern aspect. In a dry and light soil, trees
thrive better exposed to the north, than to the
south; in the former, the dew continues on the
trees, till nine or ten in the morning; and the
sun strikes not so violently as to wither the ground,
or to occasion great perspiration. But a southern
aspect merits the preference in a clay soil, and in
a cold climate.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>5. TIME OF PLANTING TREES IN THE
FIELD.</HEAD>
<P>WITH respect to the time of planting trees
where they are to stand, it runs from autumn,
when they drop the leaf, till spring, when the buds
begin to swell, provided it be fresh weather, and
the ground be tolerably dry. But because in the
dead of winter frost prevails, or too much moi∣sture,
two seasons chiefly are recommended, viz.
autumn before strong frost sets in, and spring after
it is past. In this season, planting may be conti∣nued
till the buds begin to open; which in some
<PB N="219" REF="245"/>
trees is early, in others late. The opening the
buds depends also on the season, late or early.
Whether autumn or spring be the best for plant∣ing,
is not agreed. As the weather is common∣ly
moist in autumn, trees brought from a distance
suffer less in that season by being long kept out of
the ground; and if the winter happen to be mild,
new roots are produced, which are a fine prepa∣ration
for a more vigorous vegetation in spring.
Millar holds October to be the best season for plant∣ing
trees that lose the leaf in winter, provided the
soil be dry. In a moist soil, it is better, says he,
to defer planting till the latter end of February
or beginning of March. But though this may
hold in general, there are several exceptions.
Tender plants that are hurt by frost, ought to be
delayed till spring. Trees that retain the leaf du∣ring
winter, ought to be transplanted in spring;
for, having a slow circulation of sap, they perspire
little, and run less risk of being hurt by drought.
Another reason concurs with respect to the oak,
the beech, and the hornbeam, which hold the
leaf all winter; which is, that they are late in push∣ing:
when planted in February or March, they
have time to prepare new roots before the buds
begin to swell<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is maintained by some writers, that best sea∣son for planting oak and larche, is immediately before the buds begin to push. I have not discovered any good reason for making these trees an exception from the ge∣neral rule.</NOTE>. April is undoubtedly the best
<PB N="220" REF="246"/>
season for evergreens; though they may be safe∣ly
removed at Midsummer, if near the place where
they are to stand. During winter, evergreens
are in a state approaching to rest. If removed at
that season, they do not take root till the spring
sets the sap in motion; and in a hard winter they
commonly die. Light land should infallibly be
planted in autumn; for spring-planting in such
land is subject to great distress from the summer∣sun.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>6. MANNER OF PLANTING.</HEAD>
<P>AS to the manner of planting trees in a field,
the safest way to draw trees out of a nursery for
planting, is to remove the earth from the first
row of trees, which by that means will be easily
drawn without hurting the roots; proceeding in
the same manner till all be taken up. What are
too small, may be planted in a new bed prepared
for them. For three years after trees are trans∣planted
from the nursery, the ground about them
ought to be twice stirred annually. Once a year
after will be sufficient, till the trees get entirely
the better of weeds. Plantations weeded for a
year or two only, have visibly languished. As
soon as trees thus cultivated begin to join their
branches, the lower branches sall off, and the
weeds are smothered. This is the time of the
most vigorous growth. Trees cannot be planted
<PB N="221" REF="247"/>
too thick, provided attention be given to thin
them timeously. Thick planting shelters them
from wind and from cold. When they rise
to seven or eight feet hight, so as to wave with
the wind, they ought to be weeded, to prevent
their rubbing upon one another, which is apt to
create a sort of gangrene. But let them be weed∣ed
cautiously: fix on the weakest tree, the
branches of which may be shortened, for giving
room to the trees that are to stand; and let the
tree be cut down a year or two after. This is a
better method than to cut down the tree at first;
for young trees that have too much room, are
apt to branch out instead of pushing up. This
method does finely in a plantation of firs and
pines. When the trees rise to eighteen or twen∣ty
feet, and by good roots are proof against
wind, they ought to be much thinned, so as not
to leave one nearer another than its own length.
Where trees of that height stand close together,
they occasion a stagnation of air: the air they
suck in is unwholesome, and makes them lan∣guish.
Young trees five or six feet high only,
occasion very little stagnation of air: the free
air above mixing with that below, preserves all
sweet and wholesome.</P>
<P>One method of making a plantation turn to
profit in a short time, is to begin with planting
birch in rows with intervals of six feet, stirring
the ground about them two years. In the inter∣vals
<PB N="222" REF="248"/>
sow acorns, chesnuts, or beech-mast. The
birch, a fast grower, will in a few years form a
thick wood, destroy the weeds, and shade the
young plants below them. The birch cut out
when they begin to oppress the trees under them,
will afford some profit, and leave the ground plen∣tifully
stored with better trees.</P>
<P>The best way to encourage trees planted in a
row, is to draw a trench at the side of the row, at
such a distance as not to wound the roots. The
earth thrown upon the roots will save weeding,
and secure the trees against wind. The water in
that trench will be an additional nourishment to
the trees.</P>
<P>Evergreens, perspiring less than other plants,
require less nourishment, and for that reason con∣tinue
green all winter. They resemble the exan∣guous
tribe of animals, the frog, the toad, the
tortoise, the serpent, which, perspiring little, make
a shift to pass the winter without food. Ever∣greens,
by perspiring little, have a thick, viscid,
oily, sap, which enables them to endure the win∣ter's
cold. They seem many of them to thrive
best in the temperate seasons of the year; not so
well in the heat of summer, their perspiration
being then too great for the slow ascent of the
sap. Evergreens, when transplanted, do not so
readily strike root as other trees: for which rea∣son
they ought to be taken up with a bulk of
earth about their roots. Gardeners commonly
<PB N="223" REF="249"/>
place shrubs of this kind in an osier-basket, which
soon rots after it is put into the ground with a
tree. A holly thus transplanted ought to be wa∣tered
in the month of May, if the season be dry.</P>
<P>In order to transplant a tree with a bulk of
earth about the roots, cut a trench round it at
the distance of ten or twelve inches, as deep as
the roots go, cutting over with a sharp knife all
the roots that appear. Return the earth into the
trench. Repeat the operation next year, but a
little farther from the tree. When the tree is
transplanted the year after, the roots will be so
interlaced in the bulk, that none of the earth
will fall away in carrying. The hole where the
tree is to stand, should be considerably larger than
the bulk, and made some months before planting,
to receive the influence of fun, rain, and frost.
Fill up the hole with fresh good earth, fit to en∣courage
the young roots. The harder the soil is,
the hole ought to be the larger, to receive the
greater quantity of the nourishing earth. In
making the hole, lay the upper <HI>stratum</HI> on the
one side, and what is below on the other: lay the
former about the roots, being the best soil, and
cover it with the latter. Preserve as many roots
as possible, shortening those only that are too
long, and what are torn in taking up. If the
tree have too much head, shorten the largest
branches, leaving the small branches sor carrying
leaves: it is by these that the sap is drawn up;
<PB N="224" REF="250"/>
and it is by these that perspiration is performed.
But preserve carefully the leading shoot or shoots;
for many experiments have made it evident, that
these have the greatest power to draw up the sap.
If the lime be not an exception, a tree, after its
head is lopped off, spreads into a bush, but ne∣ver
rises in height. Conclude all, by pressing
down the earth vigorously with the foot. A tree
planted deep in the ground, stands the firmer a∣gainst
wind: its roots are better protected against
sun and frost, and less apt to throw up suckers.
These considerations notwithstanding, trees ought
not to be planted deep; for they languish till they
acquire roots near the surface. These, spread∣ing
themselves in the best soil, and being accessi∣ble
to sun and rain, convey much more nourish∣ment
to the tree than those below. Nothing
however is meant against planting large trees
deeper than what are small. At the same time,
if the under soil be bad, or very moist, even large
trees ought to be planted near the surface, with
a bulk of earth about them. Because in a porous
soil the sun penetrates deeper than in clay, and
withers the roots near the surface; for that rea∣son
a tree ought to be planted deeper in the for∣mer
than in the latter. Many think, that a fir
does best where fir-trees have been recently cut:
a fir being the native of a cold country, stands
much in need of a shade in summer; and there∣fore
succeeds the best when protected from the
<PB N="225" REF="251"/>
sun by surrounding firs. So far the observation
holds, and I believe no farther.</P>
<P>It ought to be an indispensable duty, to visit
young plantations after every high wind, and to
set upright those that are shaken, pressing the
earth close about the roots. Support a tree much
shaken with a forked stick. I know no general
rule more important than this. It is my opinion,
that more trees are lost by neglect of this opera∣tion,
than any other way. The operation ought
to be renewed after every high wind, till trees
have acquired such roots as to stand firm against
wind.</P>
<P>Some are careful, to give a transplanted tree the
same position with respect to the sun, that it had in
the nursery. But experience has proved this pre∣caution
to be useless.</P>
<P>As the expence and risk of filling up a vacant
spot with a full-grown tree is great, a nursery
may be set apart for rearing young trees till they
be from fifteen to eighteen feet high. These
trees may be transplanted twice or thrice in the
nursery for multiplying their roots; and they
ought to be planted where they are to stand, with
as much as possible of the nursery-soil about the
roots. In that view, frost is the proper time for
the operation. Such trees will not at first make
so great a figure as full-grown trees; but there
will be less hazard of miscarrying.</P>
<P>Where trees of unequal growth are planted to∣gether,
<PB N="226" REF="252"/>
those of the quickest growth will overtop
the rest, and destroy them. Therefore let trees of
the same kind be planted in clumps; or let none
be mixed but what grow equally fast. I imagine
there is a beauty in small clumps, as it makes dif∣ferent
shades the more conspicuous. Colours, e∣ven
the finest, make but a faint impression in a
confused mixture.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>7. PRUNING.</HEAD>
<P>AND now of pruning. By multiplied experi∣ments
it is ascertained, that the cutting off young
branches, hurts not any sort of tree, not even the
walnut, nor the refinous kind. The lowest
branches, which in time would wither, and drop
off, ought first to be cut; but gradually, that the
tree may not be bared of leaves. Severe pruning
makes trees grow tall, but withal so slender as
not to resist wind. Every tree suffers by having
its large branches cut off, but in different de∣grees.
The wound of an elm is soon healed:
not of a walnut, an oak, or a pine; if the tree be
not vigorous, the wound is apt to rot into the
body. When a large branch is cut off, though
the place of its insertion is soon covered with wood
and bark; yet the new wood doth not unite with
the old, and there always remains a defect
within. When an overgrown branch is cut close
to the trunk, which ought to be at the end of the
<PB N="227" REF="253"/>
year, the young shoots must the next June or
July be pulled off with the hand. If cut off with
a knife, shoots will grow without end, and create
a disfiguring bunch in the tree. A writer whose
integrity equals his experience, affirms, that a
branch cut some inches from the trunk will make
no blemish in the tree<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Kennedy.</NOTE>. The greatest attention
ought to be given to the head: if forked, one
of the rival branches must be cut off six inches
high; and to the remaining stump ought to be
tied the other branch, in order to give it an up∣right
direction. If a young tree become statio∣nary,
as it is apt to do in stiff soil, cut it over by
the ground in September, or rather below the
ground. Next June or July tear off with the
hand all the shoots but the strongest, and lay earth
round the stump. If this be delayed till the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ap
fall, there is danger of tearing the bark of the
stump, which would hurt it. Avoid a knife; for
at every amputation shoots will push, which must
again be cut, and a bunch will grow.</P>
<P>Pruning may go on from the beginning of July
to the middle of September: trees later pruned
suffer by cold. A holly is an exception: it has a
large heart, and is hurt by frost if clipped or pru∣ned
after the month of July. A holly-hedge,
that was not clipped after the month of June,
<PB N="228" REF="254"/>
endured without hurt the hard frost of the year
1740.</P>
<P>The Scotch fir, which is not a fir but a pine,
deserves to be cultivated for beauty as well as for
use. In a natural wood, the timber is always
better, and freer of knots, than in a plantation.
Trees are always planted at the same time; but
in a natural wood are of different ages, the elder
bearing down the younger, but not without losing
all their under branches. This in effect proves a
benefit; for as the under branches do not spring
again, there happens to be much timber without
knots. In a planted field, on the contrary, the
trees grow all equally; and if weeding be ne∣glected,
they grow up like spindles without a la∣teral
branch: if duly weeded, so as to give room
for lateral branches, the lower branches die by
degrees, and leave knots in the trees. Therefore
to train a fir-plantation, the trees ought to be
thinned as soon as they begin to wind-wave; and
the lowest tire of branches should be cut off from
every tree that is intended to stand. Another tire
should be cut off the next year; and so on, leaving
five or six feet of the trunk without a branch. All
the wood that is added to the tree after, will be solid
without a knot. A better way is, to tear off with
the hand the under branches, which bring their
roots with them: the hollow is soon filled up with
regular fibres, and the wood is all equally good.
A branch cut away with a knife, though close to
<PB N="229" REF="255"/>
them stem, leaves its root, which becomes a knot
when surrounded with new wood. If a Scotch
fir be intended for beauty, let all other trees be
kept at a distance, and it will stand forty or fifty
years without losing a branch. When a larche is
fifteen or sixteen feet high, cut off the lowest
tire of branches in October close to the stem, and
the next two tire successively, year after year.
The rays of the sun will be admitted to the root
of the tree; and the air will have a free circula∣tion,
necessary to all plants. It will not be ne∣cessary
afterwards to use a knife to a larche, unless
it be to lop off a broken branch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Mr Duff's garden, town of Air, there was an old stump of a thorn three or four feet high, that ap∣peared to have very little life in it. It was pierced in several places with an iron nail: buds came out at e∣very hole; and now it is a flourishing tree about fifteen feet high.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Sheep and goats are more destructive to young
trees than horned cattle; and these, more than
horses. Sheep are fond of the leaves of the white
thorn, above all other food: it is folly to think of
white-thorn hedges, without banishing them.
The depredations of these creatures upon my plan∣tations,
have often swelled my heart against Pro∣vidence.
Why has it made young trees so pa∣latable
to them: what woods might not be rai∣sed,
were it not for the expence of fencing!
Such thoughts were apt to steal in upon me.
<PB N="230" REF="256"/>
But in nothing are we more wrong than in mur∣muring
against Providence. It is to us a signal
blessing that domesticated animals feed on young
trees: otherwise, the utmost industry of man
would be insufficient to prevent trees from occu∣pying
the whole ground, and putting an end to
agriculture; he would be reduced to his original
savage state.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>8. WOOD PROPER FOR INSTRUMENTS OF
HUSBANDRY.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the most expensive articles of a farm,
are carts, ploughs, brakes, harrows, rollers, &amp;c.:
and it is of importance with respect to economy,
that these should be constructed of proper wood.
To that end the following hints may be of use.</P>
<P>I begin with examining, at what age a tree is in
perfection for the purposes of a farm. At the
age of sixty, it is sufficiently large for every farm-purpose;
being, when cut to the square, from
twelve to fifteen inches each side. I must except
the oak, which, even for the purposes of farm∣ing,
improves till it be a hundred years old. E∣very
oak consists of red and white wood; the
former the firmest of all wood, the latter good
for nothing. Ash, after the growth of sixty years,
turns short and brittle.</P>
<P>The proper season for cutting a tree is, when it
has least sap; which is precisely in the middle
<PB N="231" REF="257"/>
between the time of shedding the leaf and that
of budding: in that interval it is tough, and fit∣test
for every farm-purpose. When cut in the
sap, the wood is short, and apt to split with
drought.</P>
<P>For preserving wood after being cut, there are
three methods. One is, to dry it in the air; an∣other,
to immerse it in water; and a third, to
cover it up with horse-dung. Ash, when saw∣ed
green, never fails to split. Before applying an
instrument, it ought to be exposed eighteen
months in a dry situation, that all the sap may e∣vaporate.
During that time, both ends ought to
be covered from the air: the bark prevents the
body from splitting; but when the ends are expo∣sed,
they will split into the body five or six inches.
When ash is designed for uses that require it to be
split, let it be split immediately after cutting, and
the parts laid up where the air has not free access,
in order that they may dry by slow degrees; for
sudden drought makes them warp. Oak and elm
require the same treatment. The Huntington wil∣low,
and other willows that rise to a large size,
turn extremely tough when dry; and therefore,
if intended for planks or boards, they ought to
be sawed directly after being cut. But as in this
case they are apt to split, great care ought to be
taken to dry them slowly. Alder and birch ought
to be managed in the same manner.</P>
<P>The immersing in water, and covering with
<PB N="232" REF="258"/>
horse-dung, are far from being the best methods
of drying wood. It is always harder and tougher
when dried slowly in the air. Therefore these
methods are only for expedition, in order to ex∣tract
the sap the more quickly, when the wood is
wanted for immediate use.</P>
<P>There is not an instrument of husbandry that
consists of different parts, but requires wood of
different kinds. Of all wood, oak is that which
resists moisture the best, and can the best endure
the being totally deprived of air. For these reasons,
oak is the only wood fit for being mortised into
other wood. From the part that is mortised, air
is totally excluded; and yet some moisture finds
access, being more penetrating than air. There∣fore,
the spokes of a wheel, which are mortised
both into the nave and fillies, ought indispensably
to be of oak; the sheths of harrows, which bind
the parts together, ought to be of the same wood;
as also the head of the chain-plough, because it is
mortised into the beam. As ash is less apt to
split than oak, it is the more proper wood of the
two for naves and fillies. As it is the toughest of
all wood, and the most elastic, it is fittest for the
trams of a cart. The best wood for the body of
a cart or waggon, is the Huntington willow. It
is both lighter and tougher than even the best
red fir. The head of the Scotch plough may be
of alder, because it is not mortised into any other
part. Whatever the plough be, the mouldboard
<PB N="233" REF="259"/>
may be of willow, or alder, or plane; because
they are lighter, and not apt to split. The bulls of
brakes and harrows should be of birch or alder. A
roller should be made of beech wood, being heavy,
the sheths and pins of oak, and the shafts of ash.
Foreign fir is the best and cheapest for couples.
Beech-wood is firmer and tougher. It is indeed
apt to take the worm: but in a farm-house that
is not lofted, will not the japanning with smoke
prevent that evil? The handles of spades, sho∣vels,
picks, &amp;c. ought undoubtedly to be of
ash: beside its toughness, it is less apt to turn
warm in handling, than any other wood. For
gates, fir is undoubtedly the best: It is light;
it resists moisture; and is not apt to warp.</P>
<P>One general rule I give, of more importance
than at first view may be thought, which is, that
the angle made by mortising, or otherwise, being
always the weakest part of the instrument, ought
to be fortified with a plate of iron fitting accurate∣ly
the angle of the wood.</P>
</DIV5>

<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">FLAX.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING finished what I had to say on forest-trees,
flax comes next in order, according
to the distribution made above. The regulations
published by the trustees for manufactures, have
left me little to observe upon that article. I shall
<PB N="234" REF="260"/>
venture a few particulars only, more immediately
connected with husbandry. Annual weeds a∣bound
so much in this country by careless ma∣nagement,
that the weeding of flax is the greatest
incumbrance on its culture. After horse-hoed
turnip, cabbage, or potatoes, flax succeeds well;
and I know no other crops that extirpate weeds
so effectually. A potato-crop being removed in
October, the ground during winter gets a frost-preparation;
which cannot be obtained after cab∣bage
or turnip, because these keep the ground all
winter. Therefore, above all, I recommend a
potato-crop as a preparation for flax. Next to it.
if at all inferior, is pasture-ground three or four
years old, left rough in foggage, and in that state
trench-ploughed before winter. It gets the frost-preparation,
is clean of weeds: and the rough
foggage, turned to the bottom of the furrow, re∣tains
moisture like a spunge, which it yields plen∣tifully
to the roots of the flax. Flax is a thirsty
plant; and a better situation it cannot have for
procuring nourishment.</P>
<P>In pulling flax, the fully ripe ought to be separated
from what is less so, and the tall from the short:
when mixed, they neither water well, nor dress
well. Let the seed, when separated from the
plant, be beat lightly and passed through a sieve.
The best and plumpest will come out first; and
this ought to be reserved for sowing again. Beat
what remains with a heavier hand: the seed thus
got will be fit for the oil-mill.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="261"/>
Lint pulled green requires more watering than
when fully ripe.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">HOPS.</HEAD>
<P>THE last article of this kind I undertook, is
the hop. A regular hop-yard is an under∣taking
too great for an ordinary farmer; but e∣very
farmer, by the following plan, may have hops
of his own growing sufficient for his own use, and
perhaps for his neighbours. If I can reduce the
expence within moderate bounds, I am not afraid
of the climate of Scotland: many judicious trials
made here, have produced good hops.</P>
<P>Dr Woodward has observed, that the fruit
which grows nearest the ground, is always the
best. This has suggested to me a thought, that
hops may be propagated in the espalier way like
apples or pears. Fix in the ground, at an inter∣val
of three feet, a number of poles eight or nine
feet high, in a line from west to east. Beginning
at the west end, plant a hop-vine at the foot of
every pole, the last six or seven excepted. In∣stead
of allowing them to ascend the poles, train
them from west to east in an angle with the ho∣rizon
of nine or ten degrees, and directing them
from pole to pole by small twigs between the
poles. In this manner, each vine may extend
itself twenty or thirty feet, without rising at its
<PB N="236" REF="262"/>
extremity more than ten feet above the ground. If
a hop resemble other fruit-trees, it will carry more
fruit by having the growth of the wood checked.
And if this method succeed, a small hop-planta∣tion
may be within the reach of every farmer, re∣quiring
some attention, but little expence. Poles
above twenty feet long, renewed every two or
three years, is a most expensive article in an Eng∣lish
hop-yard; and the places in Scotland are few
where they can be procured at any rate: but poles
of nine or ten feet may be procured every where.
There is another signal advantage of this method:
Wind is a great enemy to a hop-yard; but a row
of humble poles bound together by hop-vines will
be sufficiently secure against wind, especially in a
line from west to east.</P>
<P>Taking it for granted, that the fruit next the
ground is the best, I am in the course of an ex∣periment
with a young apple-tree having two
branches, one trained to the west, the other to
the east, upon small pegs of wood about six inches
high. Under these branches the earth is covered
with sharp sand, in order that the fruit may be
benefited both by the direct and reflected rays of
the sun. It deserves an experiment, whether
hops may not be trained successfully the same
way, without the expence of any poles. It will
cost very little expence to fill a whole acre in that
manner, making an interval of a foot or eighteen
inches, in order that the sun may have access to
all of them equally.</P>

</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="237" REF="263"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">MANURES.</HEAD>
<P>THE manures commonly used in Scotland
are dung, lime, shell-marl, clay-marl, and
stone-marl. Many other substances are used;
shavings of horn, for example, refuse of malt,
and even old rags: but as the quantity that can
be procured is inconsiderable, and as their appli∣cation
is simple, I shall consume no time upon
them.</P>
<P>Dung is the chief of all manures; because a
quantity of it may be collected in every farm,
and because it makes the quickest return. A
field sufficiently dunged, will produce good crops
four or five years.</P>
<P>Dung of animals that chew the cud, being
more thoroughly putresied than that of others, is
fit to be mixed with the soil without needing to be
collected into a dunghill. A horse does not chew
the cud; and in horse-dung may be perceived
straw or ryegrass broken into small parts, but not
dissolved: it is proper therefore that the putrefac∣tion
be completed in a dunghill. It ought to be
mixed there with cool materials: so hot it is,
that in a dunghill by itself, it singes and burns in∣stead
of putrefying. The difference between the
dung of a horse and of a horned animal, is visible
<PB N="238" REF="264"/>
in a pasture-field: the grass round the former is
withered; round the latter, it is ranker and more
verdant than in the rest of the field. A mixture
of dry and moist stuff, ought to be studied: the
former attracting moisture from the latter, they
become equally moist.</P>
<P>To prevent sap from running out of a dung∣hill,
its situation should be a little below the sui∣face;
and to prevent rain from running into it,
it should be surrounded with a ring of sod. If the
soil on which the dunghill stands be porous, let
it be paved, to prevent the sap from sinking into
the ground. If moisture happen to superabound,
it may be led off by a small gutter to impregnate
a quantity of rich mould laid down to receive it,
which will make it equal to good dung.</P>
<P>Straw should be prepared for the dunghill, by
being laid under cattle, and sufficiently moistened.
When laid dry into a dunghill, it keeps it open,
admits too much air, and prevents putrefaction.</P>
<P>Dung from the stable ought to be carefully
spread on the dunghill, and mixed with the former
dung. When left in heaps upon the dunghill, fer∣mentation
and putrefaction go on unequally.</P>
<P>Complete putrefaction is of importance with re∣gard
to the seed of weeds that are in the dung∣hill:
if they remain sound, they are carried out
with the dung, and infest the ground. Com∣plete
putrefaction is of still greater importance by
pulverising the dung; in which condition it mixes
<PB N="239" REF="265"/>
intimately with the soil, and operates the most
powerfully. In land intended for barley, undi∣gested
dung has an unhappy effect: it keeps the
ground open, admits drought, and prevents the
seed from springing. On the other hand, when
thoroughly rotted, it mixes with the soil, and en∣ables
it to retain moisture. It follows, that the
properest time for dunging a field, is in its highest
pulveration; at which time the earth mixes inti∣mately
with the dung. Immediately before set∣ting
cabbage, sowing turnip, or wheat, is a good
time. Dung divides and spreads the most accu∣rately
when moist. Its intimate mixture with the
soil is of such importance, that hands should be
employed to divide and spread any lumps that may
be in it.</P>
<P>Dung should be spread, and ploughed into the
ground, without delay. When a heap lies two or
three weeks, some of the moisture is embibed in∣to
the ground, which will produce tufts of corn
more vigorous than in the rest of the field. There
cannot be a worse practice than to lead out dung
before winter, leaving it exposed to frost and
snow. The whole sprit of the dung is extracted
by rain, and carried off with it. The dung di∣vested
of its sap becomes dry in spring, and inca∣pable
of being mixed with the mould. It is turn∣ed
over whole by the plough, and buried in the
surrow.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="266"/>
I approve not of ploughing down buck-wheat,
red clover, or any other crop, for manure. The
best way of converting a crop into manure is, to
pass it through the body of an animal. The dung
and piss, not to mention the profit of feeding,
will enrich the ground more than to plough down
the crop.</P>
<P>As dung is an article of the utmost importance
in husbandry, one should imagine, that the col∣lecting
it would be a capital article with an indu∣strious
farmer. Yet an ingenious writer, obser∣ving
that the Jamaicans are in this particular much
more industrious than the British, ascribes the
difference to the difficulty of procuring dung in
Jamaica. “In England, where the long winter
enables a farmer to raise what quantity he
pleases, it is not collected with any degree of
industry. But in Jamaica, where there is no
winter, and where the heat of the sun is a
great obstruction, the farmer must be indefa∣tigable,
or he will never raise any dung.”
Cool interest is not alone a sufficient motive with
the indolent, to be active. As dung is of great
importance in husbandry, a farmer cannot be too
assiduous, in collecting animal and vegetable sub∣stances
that will rot. One article of that kind
there is, to collect which there is a double mo∣tive,
and yet is neglected almost every where.
A farm full of weeds is a nuisance to the neigh∣bourhood:
<PB N="241" REF="267"/>
it poisons the fields around; and the
possessor ought to be disgraced as a pest to so∣ciety.
Now the cutting down every weed before
the seed is formed, answers two excellent pur∣poses.
First, it encourages good crops by keep∣ing
the ground clean. Next, these weeds mixed
with other materials in a dunghill, may add con∣siderably
to the quantity of dung.</P>
<P>Next of lime, which is a profitable manure, and
greatly profitable when it can be got in plenty
within a moderate distance. Philosophers differ
widely about its nature, and the cause of its ef∣fects;
and they talk so loosely, as to convince a
plain farmer that the matter is very little under∣stood.
But practice is our present theme; and
the benefit of lime is so visible, that the use of it
has become general, where the price and carriage
are in any degree moderate.</P>
<P>However people may differ in other particulars,
all agree, that the operation of lime depends on
its intimate mixture with the soil; and therefore
that the proper time of applying it, is when it is
perfectly powdered and the soil at the same time
in the highest degree of pulveration. This opi∣nion
appears to have a solid foundation. Lime
of itself is absolutely barren; and yet it enriches
a barren soil. Neither of the two produces any
good effect without the other: therefore the ef∣fect
must depend on the mixture; and conse∣quently
<PB N="242" REF="268"/>
the more intimately they are mixed the
effect must be the greater<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Buchanan of Achleshy, in Perthshire, prepared a quantity of lime for manuring a moor ploughed before winter. Lime was immediately spread upon a part of it; but the work was stopped by bad weather. The re∣maining lime was indeed covered with sod, but so slight∣ly as not to throw off the rain. When laid on the rest of the field in March, it was so clotted as to be but very imperfectly mixed with the soil. The crop of oats on the part first limed was good; that on the part last limed was good for nothing. The subsequent crops however on this part proved tolerable, the lime by repeated ploughings being better mixed with the soil.—In se∣veral parts of Scotland are found limestone of two different sorts. The operation of the one is quick when spread upon a field after calcination; but its pro∣lific effects are soon over. The other operates more slowly; but its prolific effects continue longer. The former upon being flaked falls readily into a very fine powder: the latter falls more slowly into a powder that is not so fine. This accounts for the difference. The fine powder mixes more intimately with the soil, and more quickly, than the coarse powder. For the same reason, the fine powder makes the best cement, by mix∣ing easily and perfectly with the sand and water.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Hence it follows, that lime ought always to be
slaked with a proper quantity of water, because
by that means it is reduced the most effectually
into powder. Lime left to be slaked by a moist
air, or accidental rain, is seldom or never tho∣roughly
reduced into powder; and therefore can
never be intimately mixed with the soil. Some∣times
<PB N="243" REF="269"/>
an opportunity offers to bring home shell-lime
before the ground is ready for it; and it is
commonly thrown into a heap without cover,
trusting to rain for slaking. The proper way is,
to lay the shell-lime in different heaps on the
ground where it is to be spread, to reduce these
heaps into powder by slaking with water, and to
cover the slaked lime with sod so as to defend it
from rain. One however would avoid as much as
possible the bringing home lime before the ground
be ready for it. Where allowed to lie long in a
heap, there are two bad consequences: first, lime
attracts moisture, even though well covered, and
runs into clots, which prevents an intimate mix∣ture;
and, next, we learn from Dr Black, that
burnt limestone, whether in shells or in powder,
returns gradually into its original state of lime-stone;
and upon that account also, is less capable
of being mixt with the soil. And this is verified
by a fact, that after lying long, it is so hard
bound together as to require a pick to separate
the parts.</P>
<P>For the same reason, it is a bad practice, tho'
common, to let spread lime lie on the surface all
winter. The bad effects above mentioned take
place here in part: and there is another; that rain
washes the lime down to the furrows, and in a
hanging field carries the whole away.</P>
<P>As the particles of powdered lime are both
small and heavy, they quickly sink to the bottom
<PB N="244" REF="270"/>
of the furrow, if care be not taken to prevent it.
In that view, it is a rule, that lime be spread, and
mixed with the soil, immediately before sowing,
or along with the seed. In this manner of appli∣cation,
there being no occasion to move it till the
ground be stirred for a new crop, it has time to
incorporate with the soil, and does not readily
separate from it. Thus, if turnip-seed is to be
sown broadcast, the lime ought to be laid on im∣mediately
before sowing, and harrowed in with
the seed. If a crop of drilled turnip or cabbage
be intended, the lime ought to be spread imme∣diately
before forming the drills. With respect
to wheat, the lime ought to be spread imme∣diately
before seed-furrowing. If spread more ear∣ly,
before the ground be sufficiently broken, it
sinks to the bottom. If a light soil be prepared
for barley, the lime ought to be spread after seed-surrowing,
and harrowed in with the seed. In a
strong soil, it sinks not so readily to the bottom;
and therefore, before sowing the barley, the lime
ought to be mixed with the soil by a brake.
Where moor is summer-fallowed for a crop of
oats next year, the lime ought to be laid on im∣mediately
before the last ploughing, and braked
in as before. It has sufficient time to incorporate
with the soil before the land be stirred again.</P>
<P>The quantity to be laid on, depends on the
nature of the soil. Upon a strong soil, seventy
or eighty bolls of shells are not more than suffi∣cient,
<PB N="245" REF="271"/>
reckoning four small firlots to the boll,
termed wheat-measure; nor will it be an over∣doze
to lay on a hundred bolls. Between fifty
and sixty may suffice upon medium soils; and
upon the thin or gravelly, between thirty and
forty. It is not safe to lay a much greater quan∣tity
on such soils.</P>
<P>It is common to lime a pasture-field immediate∣ly
before ploughing. This is an unsafe practice:
it is thrown to the bottom of the furrow, from
which it is never fully gathered up. The proper
time for liming a pasture-field, intended to be ta∣ken
up for corn, is a year at least, or two, before
ploughing. It is washed in by rain among the
roots of the plants; and has time to incorporate
with the soil.</P>
<P>With regard to the expence of carriage, to
have the lime-kiln so near as to go twice a-day, is
a great saving. But if there can be but one car∣riage
in a day, there is little difference as to ex∣pence,
whether the distance be seven or eleven
miles. A little more food to the cattle makes all
equal.</P>
<P>Limestone beat small makes an excellent ma∣nure,
and supplies the want of powdered lime,
where there is no feuel to burn the limestone.
Limestone beat small has not hitherto been much
used as a manure; and the proportion between
it and powdered lime has not been ascertained.
What follows may give some light. Three
<PB N="246" REF="272"/>
pounds of raw lime is by burning reduced to two
pounds of shell-lime. Yet nothing is expelled by
the fire but the air that was in the limestone:
the calcarious earth remains entire. <HI>Ergo,</HI> two
pounds of shell-lime contains as much calcarious
earth as three pounds of raw limestone. Shell∣lime
of the best quality, when slaked with water,
will measure out to thrice the quantity. But as
limestone loses none of its bulk by being burnt
into shells, it follows, that three bushels of raw
limestone contains as much calcarious earth as six
bushels of powdered lime. And consequently,
if powdered lime possess not some virtue above
raw limestone, three bushels of the latter beat
small should equal as a manure six bushels of the
former.</P>
<P>Shell-marl, as a manure, is managed in every
respect like powdered lime, with this only differ∣ence,
that a fifth or a fourth part more in mea∣sure
ought to be given. The reason is, that shell∣marl
is less weighty than lime, and that a boll of
it contains less calcarious earth, which is the fruc∣tifying
part of both.</P>
<P>I shall conclude with clay and stone marls,
which, with respect to husbandry, are the same,
though in appearance different. The manures
hitherto mentioned are restoratives only: they
recruit land when worn out by cropping, and en∣able
it to bear more crops. The marl now un∣der
consideration is not only a restorative, but has
<PB N="247" REF="273"/>
an effect still more desirable, that of altering the
nature of the soil, and improving its texture, so
as to convert it from light to heavy, and from
weak to strong. I know nothing comparable to
it in that respect, but the poaching light land by
cattle fed with turnip, mentioned in a forego∣ing
chapter. It has another effect, in appear∣ance
opposite; which is, to loosen a clay soil, and
to make it more free.</P>
<P>The goodness of this marl depends on the
quantity of calcarious earth in it; which I have
known to amount to a half or more. It is too
expensive if the quantity be less than a third or a
fourth part. Good marl is the most substantial
of all manures; because it improves the weakest
ground to equal the best borough-acres. One in∣stance
I know, of two ridges marled a hundred
and twenty years ago, that at this day make a fi∣gure
both in grass and corn far above the rest of
the field. The low part of Berwickshire, term∣ed
<HI>the Merses</HI> abounds every where with this
marl; and is the only country in Scotland where
it is in plenty.</P>
<P>As none of the manures I am acquainted with
make any distinction between weeds and corn,
the land ought to be cleared of weeds before
marling; and it ought to be smoothed with the
brake and harrow, in order that the marl may be
equally spread. Marl is a fossil on which no ve∣getable
will grow: its efficacy depends, like that of
<PB N="248" REF="274"/>
lime, on its pulveration, and intimate mixture
with the soil. Toward the former, alternate
drought and moisture contribute greatly, as also
frost. Therefore after being evenly spread, it
ought to lie on the surface all winter. In the
month of October, it may be roused with a brake,
which will bring to the surface, and expose to the
air and frost, all the hard parts, and mix with the
soil all that is powdered. In that respect it differs
widely from dung and lime, which ought to be
ploughed into the ground without delay. Oats
is a hardy grain, which will answer for being the
first crop after marling, better than any other;
and it will succeed though the marl be not tho∣roughly
mixed with the soil. In that case, the
marl ought to be ploughed in with an ebb furrow
immediately before sowing, and braked thorough∣ly.
It is ticklish to make wheat the first crop: if
sown before winter, frost swells the marl, and is
apt to throw the seed out of the ground; if sown
in spring, it will suffer more than oats by want of
due mixture.</P>
<P>Summer is the proper season for marling; be∣cause
in that season the marl, being dry, is not
only lighter, but is easily reduced to powder.
Frost however is not improper for marling, espe∣cially
as in frost there is little opportunity for any
other work.</P>
<P>Marl is a heavy body, and sinks to the bottom
of the furrow, if indiscreetly ploughed. There∣fore
<PB N="249" REF="275"/>
the first crop should always have an ebb fur∣row.
During the growing of that crop, the
marl has time to incorporate with the soil, and to
become a part of it; after which it does not rea∣dily
separate.</P>
<P>Stone marl is so hard by a considerable mixture
of sand, that it will continue without dissolving
for years. In that case, the expence of breaking
the larger lumps with hammers would not be lost:
such lumps have no effect to promote vegetation;
and they are beside an obstruction to ploughing
and harrowing.</P>
<P>About twenty years ago, many Merse tenants ap∣plied
their whole strength to marling, with very
great success: and yet of late they seem more in∣tent
on liming; which may appear singular in a
country where husbandry goes on with alacrity.
But leases in that country are commonly limited
to nineteen years, which, it is thought, affords
too little time for drawing all the profit from this
expensive manure, that the tenant is intitled to.
To marl to perfection, requires four hundred cart∣loads
on an acre, as much as can be drawn by
two sturdy horses; which, at a moderate com∣putation,
costs about L. 4 per acre. But a field
can be suffciently limed from the distance of fif∣teen
English miles, for little above the half of that
sum; with this additional convenience, that a
farmer can hire carts for liming, instead of being
consined to his own horses, as he must be in marl∣ing;
<PB N="250" REF="276"/>
by which means, liming can be carried on
with much more expedition than marling. Not∣withstanding
these differences, it is easy to evince,
that even on a lease of nineteen years, marl will
afford a greater profit than lime. Limed ground
cannot bear without injury above three or four
crops; after which it ought to be laid down in
grass. A field well marled, will produce rich
crops of corn, in the simplest manner of culture,
as long as the lease endures. Now, though grass
is more profitable than corn in a poor soil, the
profit bears no proportion in a rich soil, which
produces excellent crops, with no greater labour
nor expence than is necessarily bestowed on poor
soil.</P>

<DIV3 N="12" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">FENCES.</HEAD>
<P>IN Scotland, fences of several kinds are used.
Stone-walls and thorn-hedges are the best and
the most common.</P>
<P>The height of a dry-stone wall is directed by
the use it is intended for. If intended for sheep,
it cannot be under six feet high, every rood of
which, being thirty-six square ells, will at a medium
cost twenty shillings. A dry-stone wall for horses
or horned cattle cannot be u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der five feet high.
The expence of inclosing in this manner is consi∣derable.
<PB N="251" REF="277"/>
A square field of ten acres inclosed with
a wall six feet high, will cost L. 50, 15 s.; and
L. 42: 5: 10, if the wall be five feet high. And
it will require two and one half per cent. to keep
them in order. To build with lime, as many
do, inflames the cost; and yet upon the whole is
a saving where lime is at hand.</P>
<P>To reduce both the expence of building dry∣stone
walls, and of upholding them, I warmly re∣commend
the following mode. Raise the wall to
the height only of two feet and a half, and cope
it with sod in the following manner. First, lay on
the wall with the grafsy side undermost, sod cut
with the spade four or five inches deep, and of a
length to equal the thickness of the wall. Next,
cover this sod with loose earth rounded like a
ridge. Third, prepare thin sod, cast with the
paring spade, sufficiently long for the thickness of
the wall, and two inches more on each side.
With these cover the loose earth, keeping the
grassy side uppermost: place them so much on
edge, as that each sod shall cover part of another,
leaving only free two inches above. Fourth,
when twenty or thirty yards are thus finished,
let the sod be beat with mells by two men, one
on each side of the wall, striking both at the same
time. By this operation, the sod becomes a com∣pact
body, that keeps in the moisture, and en∣courages
the grass to grow. Lastly, cut off the
ragged ends of the sod on each side of the wall,
<PB N="252" REF="278"/>
to make the covering neat and regular. The
month of October is the proper season for this o∣peration,
because the sun and wind, during sum∣mer,
dries the sod, and hindres the grass from ve∣getating.
Moist soil affords the best sod. Wet
soil is commonly too fat for binding; and at any
rate, the watery plants it produces will not thrive
in a dry situation. Dry soil, on the other hand,
being commonly ill bound with roots, shakes to
pieces in handling. The ordinary way of coping
with sod, which is to lay them flat and single,
looks as if intended to dry the coping, and to kill
the grass; not to mention, that the sod is liable
to be blown off the wall by every high wind.</P>
<P>Having finished the wall, cast a ditch on each
side, beginning a foot from the root of the wall,
and sloping outward to the depth of three feet, or
at least two and a half. The ditch should be e∣qually
sloped on the other side, so as to be four
feet wide.</P>
<P>A rood of this fence, including every ar∣ticle,
may be done for three shillings or therea∣bout;
and a field of ten acres may be thus in∣closed
for about L. 30. If the ditch be made
three feet deep, the fence will be above six feet
high; and above L. 20 will be saved of what a
dry-stone wall six feet high will cost. Nor is this
saving the most considerable article. A fence of
which the parts are so well joined together, will
stand many years with little or no reparation.
<PB N="253" REF="279"/>
That this is far from being the case of a dry-stone
wall six feet or even five feet high, all the world
know.</P>
<P>Next of thorn-hedges. The advantage of the
white thorn for a fence above every other plant,
is well understood. It is a quick grower when
planted in proper soil, shooting up six or seven
feet in a season. Though tender when young
and hurt by weeds, it turns strong, and may be
cut into any shape. Even when old, it is more
disposed than other trees to lateral shoots. And,
lastly, its prickles make it the most proper of all
for a fence.</P>
<P>The method of sowing the seed in beds, is set
forth in the chapter of Forest-Trees. After the
plants have stood a full year in the seed-bed,
transplant the largest into a nursery, which will
leave sufficient room for the remainder, to stand
where they are another year. In the nursery they
ought to stand at the distance of seven, eight, or
nine inches from each other; and there they may
remain till fit to be planted in a hedge, which is
no sooner than at the age of five. Room in a
nursery is of great importance: when straitened
for room, the plants shoot up fast, are weakly,
and unfit to bear the hardships of an open field.
The distance ought to be proportioned to the soil;
the greatest in a rich soil, because they grow fast;
the least in a poor soil, where they grow slow.
The best soil for a nursery is between rich and
<PB N="254" REF="280"/>
poor. In the latter, the plants are dwarfish: in
the former they are luxuriant and tender, and apt
to be hurt in the severity of weather: and these
immperfections are incapable of any remedy. An
essential requisite in a nursery is free ventilation.
How common is it to find nurseries in hollow∣sheltered
places, surrounded with walls and high
plantations, more fit for pine-apples than for bar∣ren
trees. The plants thrust out long shoots, but
feeble and tender: when exposed to a cold situa∣tion,
they decay, and sometimes die. But there
is a reason for every thing: the nuseryman's view
is to make profit by saving ground, and by im∣posing
on the purchaser tall plants, for which he
pretends to demand double price. It is so diffi∣cult
to purchase wholesome and well-nursed plants,
that every gentleman-farmer ought to raise plants
for himself.</P>
<P>As thorns will grow pleasantly from roots, I
have long practised a frugal and expeditious me∣thod,
of raising them from the wounded roots
that must be cut off when thorns are to be set in
a hedge. These roots cut into small parts, and put
in a bed of fresh earth, will produce plants the
next spring, no less vigorous than what are pro∣duced
from seed. And thus a perpetual succes∣sion
of plants may be obtained without any more
seed.</P>
<P>It ought to be a rule, never to admit into a
hedge plants under five years old: they deserve
<PB N="255" REF="281"/>
all the additional sum that can be demanded for
them. Young and feeble plants in a hedge, are
of slow growth; and beside loss of time, the pa∣ling,
necessary to secure them from cattle, must
be renewed more than once before they become
a fence.</P>
<P>A thorn-hedge may be planted in every month
of winter and spring, unless it be frost. But I
have always observed, that thorns planted in Oc∣tober
are more healthy, push more vigorously,
and fewer decay, than at any other time. In
preparing the thorns for planting, the roots
ought to be left as entire as possible, and nothing
cut away but the ragged parts.</P>
<P>As a thorn-hedge suffers greatly by weeds, the
ground where they are to be planted ought to be
made perfectly clean. The common method of
planting is, to leave eight or nine inches along a
side of the intended ditch for a scarsement; and
behind the scarsement to lay the surface-soil of the
intended ditch, cut into square sods two or three
inches deep, its grassy surface undermost. Upon
that sod, whether clean or dirty, the thorns are
laid, and the earth of the ditch above them. Ac∣cording
to that method, the grass in the scarse∣ment,
with what weeds are in the moved earth,
soon grow up, and require double diligence to
prevent the young thorns from being choked.
The following method, which is creeping into
practice, deserves all the additional trouble it re∣quires.
<PB N="256" REF="282"/>
Leaving a scarsement as above of ten
inches, and also a border for the thorns, broad
or narrow according to their size, lay behind the
border all the surface of the intended ditch,
champed small with the spade, and upon it lay the
mouldery earth that fell from the spade in cutting
the said surface. Cover the scarsement and bor∣der
with the under earth, three inches thick at
least; laying a little more on the border to raise
it higher than the scarsement, in order to give
room for weeding. After the thorns are prepared,
by smoothing their ragged roots with a knife,
and lopping off their heads in order to make them
grow bushy, they are laid fronting the ditch, with
their roots on the border, the head a little high∣er
than the root. Special care must be taken
to spread the roots among the surface-earth ta∣ken
out of the ditch, and to cover them with the
mouldery earth that lay immediately below. This
article is of importance, because the mouldery
earth is the finest of all. Cover the stems of the
thorns with the next <HI>stratum</HI> of the ditch, lea∣ving
always an inch at the top free. It is no
matter how poor this <HI>stratum</HI> be, as the plants
draw no nourishment from it. Go on to finish the
ditch, pressing down carefully every row of earth
thrown up behind the hedge, which makes a so∣lid
mound impervious to rain. It is a safeguard
to the young hedge to raise this mound as perpen∣dicular
as possible; and for that end it may be
<PB N="257" REF="283"/>
proper in loose soil, when the mound is raised a
foot or so, to bind it with a row of the tough sod,
which will support the earth above, till it become
solid by lying.</P>
<P>This is sufficient in rich soil; but where the
soil is not rich, greater care is necessary. Behind
the line of the ditch, the ground intended for the
scarcement and border should be summer-fallow∣ed,
manured, and cleared of all grass-roots; and
this culture will make up for the inferiority of
soil. In very poor soil it is vain to think of plant∣ing
a thorn-hedge; for it will give no satisfaction,
because it never will become a fence. In such
ground there is a necessity for a stone fence.</P>
<P>The only reason that can be given for laying
thorns as above described, is to give the roots
space to push in all directions, even upward into
the mound of earth. There may be some advan∣tage
in this; but, in my apprehension, the dis∣advantage
is much greater of heaping so much
earth on the roots, as to exclude not only the sun
and air, but even rain, which runs down the slop∣ing
bank, and has no access to the roots. In∣stead
of laying the thorns fronting the ditch,
would it not do better to lay them paralled to the
ditch; covering the roots with three or four
inches of the best earth, which would make a
hollow between the plants and the sloping bank?
This hollow would intercept every drop of rain
that falls on the bank, to sink gradually among
<PB N="258" REF="284"/>
the roots. If this be not a better position for a
thorn, it must be of a singular constitution. I
venture one step farther out of the common path.
Why at any rate should a thorn be put in the
ground sloping? This is not the practice with
respect to any other tree; and I have heard of no
experiment to persuade me that a thorn thrives
better sloping than erect. But as in natural hi∣story
experiment is always our last resource, I am
at present following out a comparative trial. I
have many young hedges in the way first descri∣bed:
some I have laid parallel to the ditch in the
way now described, and some I have planted e∣rect
with their tops entire. The trials are fairly
made; and time will determine the best method.</P>
<P>In a rich soil the thorns may be planted ten
inches asunder; and from that to six inches in
inferior soils. To preserve them from cattle, the
ditch ought to be six feet wide, three feet deep,
and as narrow at bottom as the breadth of the
spade will allow. But when the thorns are suf∣ficiently
covered, the prudent way is to delay fi∣nishing
the ditch till the frost be over. Spring is
the proper time for completing the work, while
there is sufficient sap in the soil, to bind the
mound of earth that is raised behind the thorns.
If delayed till the earth be dry, it never binds: if
completed the beginning of winter, frost swells
the earth, loosens it, and makes it crumble
down.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="285"/>
The hedge is fenced from cattle on the one side
by the ditch; but it is necessary that it be fenced
on both sides. The ordinary method of a paleing
is no sufficient fence against cattle: the most
gentle make it a rubbing-post; and the vitious
break it down wantonly with their horns. The
only effectual remedy is expensive; but better no
fence than one that is imperfect. The remedy is,
two ditches and two hedges, with a high mound
of earth between them. Survey Scotland, and
you will not find any fences otherwise constructed
without many breaches; the repairing of which
gives much trouble and little satisfaction. If this
remedy however be not palatable, the paleing
ought at least to be of the strongest kind. Many
different kinds have been put in practice, that
are extremely frail. I recommend the following,
as the best I am acquainted with. Drive into
the ground strong stakes three feet and a half
long, with intervals from eight to twelve inches,
according to the size of the cattle that are to be
enclosed; and all precisely of the same height.
Prepare plates of wood sawed out of logs, every
plate three inches broad and half an inch thick.
Fix them on the head of the stakes, with a nail
driven down into each stake. The stakes will be
united so firmly, that one cannot be moved with∣out
the whole; and will be proof accordingly a∣gainst
the rubbing of cattle. But, after all, it is
no fence against vitious cattle. The only proper
<PB N="260" REF="286"/>
place for it is the side of a high-road, or to fence
a plantation of trees. It will indeed be a sufficient
fence against sheep, and endure till the hedge it∣self
be a fence. A fence thus completed, inclu∣ding
thorns, ditching, wood, nails, &amp;c. will not
much exceed two shillings every six yards.</P>
<P>We are now arrived at the most important ar∣ticle
of all, that of training up a thorn-hedge after
it is planted. The ordinary method is, to cut off
the top, and shorten the lateral branches, in or∣der
to make it thick and bushy. To the same
end, the young thorns, after standing six or seven
years, are sometimes cut over within two or three
inches of the ground, which multiplies the stems,
and makes the hedges still thicker. This form of
a hedge catches the eye: by its thickness it is for∣midable
to cattle; but its weakness is discovered
when bare of leaves, and cattle break through e∣very
where without obstruction.</P>
<P>I have the experience of three hedges trained
for twelve years as follows. The first has been
annually pruned top and sides. The sides of the
second have been pruned, but the top left entire.
The third was allowed to grow without any pru∣ning.
The first is at present about four feet
b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oad and thick from top to bottom; but weak in
its stems, and unable to resist any horned beast.
The second is strong in its stems, and close from
top to bottom. The third is also strong in its
stems, but for two feet up bare of lateral branches,
<PB N="261" REF="287"/>
which have been destroyed by the overshadowing
of those above, depriving them both of rain and
air. That the second is the best method, is as∣certained
by experience. And that it ought to
be so, will be evident if we can trust to analogy.
In the natural growth of a tree, its trunk is pro∣portioned
to its height: lop off the head, it spreads
laterally and becomes a bush, without rising in
height, or swelling in the trunk. The lime-tree is
the only exception I know: the white thorn I am
certain is not an exception. Hence the following
method of training up a hedge, which is to allow
the thorns to grow without applying a knife to
their tops, till their stems be sive or six inches in
circumference. In good soil, with careful weed∣ing,
they will be of that bulk in ten or twelve
years, and be fifteen feet high or upward. The
lateral branches only must be attended to. Those
next the ground must be pruned within two feet
of the stem: those above must be made shorter
and shorter, in proportion to their distance from
the ground; and at five feet high they must be
cut close to the stem, leaving all above full free∣dom
of growth. By this dressing, the hedge
takes on the appearance of a very steep roof; and
it ought to be kept in that form by pruning. This
form gives free access to rain, sun, and air: e∣very
twig has its share, and the whole is preserved
in vigour. When the stems have arrived at their
proper bulk, cut over them at five feet from
<PB N="262" REF="288"/>
the ground, where the lateral branches end. This
answers two excellent purposes; the first is, to
strengthen the hedge, the sap that formerly a∣scended
to the top being now distributed among
the branches. The next is, that a tall hedge
stagnates the air, and poisons both corn and grass
near it. A hedge trained up in this manner, is
impenetrable even by a bull: he may press in the
lateral branches; but the stems stand firm. For
an instant proof that this method will answer, ob∣serve
the thorns that from space to space are al∣lowed
to grow up above their fellows, in form of
a hedge-row. These thorns, though growing in
the middle of a bushy hedge, have stems far lar∣ger
than the rest. Beside the strength of such a
hedge, it is less expensive than a hedge reared in
the ordinary way: the weeds are sooner choaked;
and it requires much less pruning. When so much
labour is saved, one will the less grudge the price
of the best thorns that can be procured. Good
thorns are indeed more essential in this manner of
training up a hedge than in any other: they ought
all to be of an equal size, and equally vigorous,
that they may not overtop one another. The in∣termixing
of strong and weak plants is of less im∣portance,
where the heads are cut off and all made
to grow equally.</P>
<P>Plashing an old hedge, an ordinary practice in
England, makes indeed a good interim fence;
but at the long-run is destructive to the hedge:
<PB N="263" REF="289"/>
and accordingly, there is scarce to be met with a
complete good hedge where plashing has been
long practised. A cat is said among the vulgar to
have nine lives: is it their opinion, that a thorn,
like a cat, may be cut and slashed at will without
suffering by it? Lucky it is, that the method
here recommended renders plashing altogether
unnecessary.</P>
<P>A hedge ought never to be planted on the top
of the mound of earth thrown up from the ditch.
It has indeed the advantage of an awful situation;
but being planted in bad foil, and destitute of moi∣sture,
it cannot thrive: it is at best dwarfish, and
frequently decays and dies.</P>
<P>To plant trees in the line of the hedge, or with∣in
a few feet of it, ought to be absolutely prohi∣bited,
as a heterodox practice. It is amazing,
that people should fall into this error, when they
ought to know, that there never was a good
thorn-hedge with trees in it. And how should it
be otherwise? an oak, a beech, an elm, grows
faster than a thorn: when suffered to grow in the
midst of a thorn-hedge, it spreads its roots every
where, and robs the thorns of their nourishment.
Nor is this all: the tree overshadowing the
thorns keeps the sun and air from them. At the
same time, no tree takes worse with being over∣shadowed
than a thorn.</P>
<P>It is scarce necessary to mention gaps in a
hedge; because they will seldom happen where a
<PB N="264" REF="290"/>
hedge is trained up as above recommended. But
in the ordinary method of training, gaps are fre∣quent,
partly by the failure of plants, and partly
by the trespassing of cattle. The ordinary me∣thod
of making up gaps is, to plant sweet brier
where the gap is small, and a crab where it
its larger. This method I cannot approve, for
an obvious reason: a hedge ought never to
be composed of plants that grow unequally:
those that grow fast overtop and hurt the slow
growers; and with respect in particular to a crab
and sweet brier, neither of them thrive under
shade. It is a better method to remove all the
withered earth in the gap, and to substitute fresh
sappy mould mixed with some lime or dung.
Plant upon it a vigorous thorn of equal height
with the hedge, which in its growth will equal
the thorns it is mixed with. In that view, there
should be a nursery of thorns of all sizes, even to
five feet high, ready to fill up gaps. The best
season for this operation is the month of October.
I should have added, that a gap filled with sweet
brier, or a crab lower than the hedge, invites
cattle to break through and trample the young
plants under foot; to prevent which a paleing on
both sides is far from being sufficient, unless it be
raised as high as the hedge.</P>
<P>Nothing hitherto has been said about an inclo∣sure
for sheep. To carry a farm to its perfection,
every inclosure ought to be made so as to keep in
<PB N="265" REF="291"/>
sheep, though not chiefly intended for them; for
sheep ought to be mixed with other cattle in e∣very
pasture-field: they eat what others leave,
and others eat what they leave. But farmers ge∣nerally
take a humbler flight, and are satisfied with
one or two inclosures for sheep. In that view I
premise, that of all animals sheep naturally take
the widest range in feeding; for which reason, an
inclosure for them ought never to be under fifty
or sixty acres. Where they have so much room,
any fence will keep them in: where confined to
five, six, or even ten acres, the most awful fence
is scarce sufficient. I talk of the common run of
sheep; not of the large Lincolnshire breed, habi∣tuated
to inclosures, which have no genius for
leaping.</P>
<P>Where stones are to be had, the cheapest and
most effectual is the stone fence above described.
If a farm cannot afford an inclosure so large as
that now mentioned, the deepness of the ditch
ought to be in a reciptocal proportion to the size
of the inclosure: in a small inclosure, the fence
ought at least to be six feet high. If the farmer
be reduced to a quickset hedge by want of stones,
the scarsement must be eighteen inches broad, in
order to receive a paleing between the root of the
hedge and lip of the ditch; inclining to the ditch
in form of a stocade, which will make it the more
awful. This will fit the inclosure immediately
for sheep, without waiting the slow growth of the
<PB N="266" REF="292"/>
hedge. When the paleing fails, the ditch must
be lined up with stones to the height of the
hedge, to prevent the sheep from making a road
up the side of the ditch to come at the thorns;
which would ruin all, for no food is so palatable
to them as the leaves of thorn. Where stones are
scarce, two feet of stones may do, raising the li∣ning
to the height of the thorns with sod.</P>
<P>One thing is never to be omitted in a large in∣closure.
Sheep require a shelter against heat, no
less than against cold. The stone fence recom∣mended,
affords little shelter against either. There∣fore,
a shelter ought to be made somewhere in the
driest part of the field. Plant ten or twelve rows
of Scotch fir or spruce fir in a curve, semicircular,
or eliptical, the concave fronting the south, and
sufficiently capacious for beds to all the sheep.
Surround this plantation with a stone fence of the
same form with what incloses the field. The
weakest trees ought to be weeded out from time
to time, which will give the trees that stand room
to extend their lateral branches. And the plan∣tation
when grown up will protect the sheep from
all cold or fierce winds. The dung dropt in this
sheltered place, may be gathered and put in a
dunghill, or spred upon the field.</P>
<P>A sheep yields more profit by pasture than any
other animal; and as its dung enriches the soil
more, I must repeat again, that a provident far∣mer
ought to have more enclosures than one: he
<PB N="267" REF="293"/>
will have the benefit of fine crops of corn by re∣moving
successively sheep from on<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> inclosure to
another.</P>
<P>A word more before I end, which shall be on
the gates of inclosures. The posts upon which the
gate is hung, though built of stone and lime, is
apt to be shaken by a heavy gate, and to be torn
to pieces by a careless driver running the axle of
his cart against it. But instead of building a wall
in the line of the inclosure, let it be built perpen∣dicular
to it, seven or eight feet long, thickest in
the middle and tapering toward the ends. Such
a wall or post will be proof against any force.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE PROPER SIZE OF A FARM, AND THE
USEFUL ACCOMMODATIONS IT OUGHT
TO HAVE.</HEAD>
<P>TO confine a tenant to that quantity of land
which can be managed to the best purpose
with the least expence, is the surest means of ob∣taining
an adequate rent without oppression. A
farm ought never to contain a less quantity of
land than sufficient for a plough; and there is no
medium between that quantity, and as much as
will give full employment to two. Less than suf∣ficient
for a plough, is an evident loss to the te∣nant,
<PB N="268" REF="294"/>
and consequently to the landlord: the ser∣vants
and cattle must at times be idle for want of
work; or what is worse, they will work indolent∣ly,
and make no progress. I have a striking proof
of this observation. The estate of Grange in the
carse of Falkirk, containing about 360 Scotch
acres, paid of rent L. 450. It was possessed by
no fewer than eleven tenants; not one of the
farms sufficient for a plough, several of them be∣tween
twenty and thirty acres. A map was made:
it was clearly seen, that the estate could hold but
six tenants; and it luckily happened, that there
were six houses abundantly centrical for these te∣nants,
without necessity of new buildings. The
saving of twenty horses and ten servants, and the
maintainance of five tenants and their families,
was great; beside the profit that each tenant was
intitled to for his skill and labour. The six tenants
that took the whole offered at once an advance of
L. 194 Sterling, which was accepted, though not
equal to the saving. And accordingly the pre∣sent
rent of L. 644 will be easier on the six te∣nants,
than the former rent of L. 450 was on the
eleven. A farm, on the other hand, that cannot
be commanded by one plough, and is not suffi∣cient
for two, is a still greater loss. The tenant,
struggling to make something of every field, does
justice to no field; and the farm turns poorer and
poorer every year. It is well known, that most
farms in Scotland are too large for the ability of
<PB N="269" REF="295"/>
the tenant. The reason is, that in an uncultiva∣ted
country, the adding twenty or thirty acres
more is little regarded. I could give many in∣stances
of a tenant beginning to thrive after being
deprived of part of his farm. But it is unneces∣sary
to give instances, for they are known every
where.</P>
<P>When one thinks of calculating what quantity
of land is sufficient for a single plough, many cir∣cumstances
occur, that make it impracticable to
determine the point with any precision. The
difference between a light and a heavy soil, is con∣siderable;
and no less so, the nearness or distance
of manure. The mode of cropping is capital:
where all the different plants are sown in spring
and reaped in autumn, more ploughs are requi∣site
than when crops are dispersed through the
year, according to the present improved mode of
culture. I venture only in general to say, that
in most soils fifty acres of corn may be command∣ed
by a single plough, provided the crops be dis∣tributed
through the year, to afford time for ma∣naging
all of them with the same men and cattle.
But where grass is necessary for keeping the soil
in heart, a farm ought to be enlarged in propor∣tion
to the quantity of grass required; for there
ought always to be as much land in tillage as fully
to occupy a plough. If a third part in grass be
sufficient, the farm ought to consist of seventy-five
acres: if a half be necessary, the farm ought to
<PB N="270" REF="296"/>
be 100 acres; and if the soil be so mean as to re∣quire
two thirds in grass, the extent of the farm
ought to be 150 acres. If the reader be curious
about further particulars, I refer him to the se∣venth
chapter, in which a few examples are gi∣ven
of the number of acres that in different modes
of cropping may be commanded by one plough.
These examples will pave the way to computations
corresponding to other rotations.</P>
<P>I proceed to an interesting article, which is to
compare great and small farms in point of utility.
I call a small farm what employs but a single
plough; and a smaller there ought not to be. A
middling farm is what requires two ploughs; and
whatever requires a greater number, I call a great
farm. These different farms I shall consider with
respect to the landlord, with respect to the tenant,
and with respect to the public.</P>
<P>With respect to the landlord, there are advan∣tages
and disadvantages that tend to balance each
other. Small farms draw the greatest number of
candidates; which cannot fail to raise the rents.
On the other hands, small farms occasion a great
expence for houses; and in a country where build∣ing
materials are costly, large farms may appear
to be the interest of the landlord.</P>
<P>With respect to tenants, a farm as large as can
accurately be managed, is undoubtedly the in∣terest
of a tenant, provided he have a fund for
stocking the farm sufficiently. But this is really
<PB N="271" REF="297"/>
saying no more, but that it is beneficial to have a
large fund. The proper question is, Whether
with respect to farmers in general, it is not a con∣venience
to have the choice of small or great farms,
according to their stock? In that view, small
farms are undoubtedly advantageous to those
who want to be farmers; because in Scotland, at
least, the number is much greater of those who
can stock a small farm, than of those who can go
farther. It may possibly be objected, that there
is an inconvenience in a small farm where two
horses only are necessary for a plough, in respect
that two horses make but a slow progress in carry∣ing
corn or dung. To this objection there is a
ready answer: two horses in two single carts will
make as much expedition in carrying out the
dung, or carrying in the corn of a small farm, as
double that number will make in a middling farm,
where the dung and corn are double in quantity.
I say further, that if two horses be not sufficient,
the defect may be readily supplied by two draught
oxen, which add very little to the expence of the
farm. These at four years of age may be pur∣chased
for L. 10. They will give at seven L. 15;
and this profit, with no more work than sufficient
to give them a stomach, will balance their sum∣mer-food
of green clover. Their winter-food of
straw cannot enter into the computation, being
the very best way of converting straw into dung.
Here there is a great convenience. Where a
<PB N="272" REF="298"/>
field, by drought or otherwise, is rendered too
stiff for a pair, the oxen may be yoked in the
plough with the horses. In ground less stiff, the
farmer has a choice of two oxen and a horse, of
two horses alone, or of two oxen. Where
ploughing happens to be retarded by bad weather,
two ploughs may be employed, which is a signal
convenience. Ploughing also and harrowing may
go on at the same time; and the farmer has it al∣ways
in his power to yoke two double carts. Even
in carse-soil this plan will answer; as there is sel∣dom
occasion to employ the oxen but where the
ground is sufficiently dry for them.</P>
<P>With respect to the public, small farms are un∣doubtedly
the most advantageous. The number
of servants, it is true, must be in proportion to
the size of the farm: but in a middling farm there
is but one tenant; whereas in two small farms of
no greater extent, there are two. And the dif∣ference
is still greater in large farms. This is a
capital circumstance. The children of tenants are
taught to read and write; and in general are bet∣ter
educated than children of day-labourers, which
qualifies them better for being artists and manu∣facturers.
They are also commonly more nume∣rous,
being better nourished during nonage, and
better preserved from diseases. Small farms ac∣cordingly
are not only favourable to population,
but to the most useful population. I would not
therefore indulge willingly any farm beyond a
<PB N="273" REF="299"/>
middle size. And to check those of a larger size,
I am clear for a tax of L. 3 or L. 4 yearly upon
every farm that requires three ploughs; and so
on according to the number. I except proprietors,
who ought to be encouraged to improve their e∣states:
let them employ as many ploughs as they
find convenient, and not be subjected to any tax.
If any undertaker be willing to lay out a large
sum of money upon farming, the profit of a long
lease will enable him to pay the tax. This tax at
the same time may be so contrived, as to answer
a valuable purpose, that of exciting farmers to
use oxen instead of horses; which will be done by
exempting oxen-ploughs from the tax. And the
undertaker mentioned will be relieved from the
tax altogether, if he employ such ploughs only.</P>
<P>THE size of a farm being adjusted, next in or∣der
are its accommodations. The first accom∣modation
I shall mention is, an acre planted with
trees proper for the farm; fir in particular and
ash. The worst soil will answer the former, and
moist soil the latter. These are at hand for pale∣ing
and other purposes; and without such a con∣venience
a tenant's hands are in a measure bound
up.</P>
<P>Another accommodation follows. However well
adjusted the size of a farm may be to the strength
employed upon it; yet to have a farm in perfection
there ought always to be some bywork, about
<PB N="274" REF="300"/>
which the servants and horses may be employed,
when the ordinary culture of the farm does not
require them. There is a great difference be∣tween
good and bad weather, with respect to ex∣pedition.
The farmer must provide against the
latter, by sufficiency of men and horses, which in
the former have not full employment. Therefore,
to provide against want of work, there ought to
be a resource, such as may be taken up or laid
down as occasion offers. The carrying lime to a
farm, or marl, or dung from a neighbouring
town, are excellent resources.</P>
<P>The chief accommodation of all is, a fruitful
kitchen-garden. Formerly, oat-meal was the only
food of our labouring people; and when at five
or six shillings per boll, there could not be cheap∣er
food. A kitchen-garden was at that time a
sort of luxury, and our simple peasants had no
notion of luxury. By a great advance in the price
of oats and oat-meal, a kitchen-garden has be∣come
an article of economy; and yet scarce more
attended to than formerly. Well dreffed and crop∣ed,
it will afford half maintenance to a family;
and will not cost the half of oat-meal. But the
ignorant are slaves to custom; and no value is put
on a kitchen-garden at present, because it was of
no value thirty years ago.</P>
<P>The extent of this garden depends on the man∣ner
of croping the farm. Where red clover is
one of the crops in the rotation, a kitchen-garden
<PB N="275" REF="301"/>
need not exceed two or three acres. Where red
clover enters not into the rotation, six acres are
the smallest quantity even for a single plough;
because it must yield food both for man and beast.
Take the following rotation, which at the same
time is capable of greater variety in a kitchen∣garden
of greater extent than six acres. Two
acres are necessary for summer-food to the farm∣cattle,
cows, &amp;c. Two acres more will be use∣fully
employed in cabbage, colewort, turnip, car∣rot,
potatoes, leeks, onions, turky-beans, white
pease, and other kitchen-stuff, for food to the fa∣mily.
The remaining two acres must be sown
with barley and red clover. To give directions
for the culture of the vegetables intended for the
family use, would be a treatise on the kitchen∣garden.
I shall only slightly observe, that the early
cabbage, termed <HI>May cabbage,</HI> may be set the
end of February, or as soon after as the season
answers; and will be ready for eating in May
and June. Scotch cabbage ought to be set in
March; and a few set in June will be ready for
eating next spring. The season for sowing car∣rots,
onions, and leeks, is the same with that of
oats. Onions require a rich soil; and if that be
wanting, leeks may supply their place. Potatoes
ought never to be neglected: they make a hearty
food, and the cheapest of all: upon which ac∣count,
as many ought to be raised as will serve
the family the year round. Turnip is proper for
<PB N="276" REF="302"/>
cows after calving; and to turnip may be added
what cabbage or colewort are saved from the fa∣mily-use.
This succulent food will produce plenty
of milk for rearing calves, an article little regard∣ed
in Scotland. Careful culture may afford some
residue for feeding an old cow or ox during win∣ter;
which in spring may be sold to great advan∣tage,
instead of being sold the beginning of win∣ter
for a trifle.</P>
<P>A kitchen-garden is always surrounded with
trees, from the notion that it requires shelter.
Young plants require shelter; but not those that
are advanced in growth. Plants long sheltered in
a kitchen-garden, are too tender for the field.
And for evidence that they prosper greatly by a
free circulation of air, they rise in the field to a
much greater size than in a sheltered garden. I
need scarce add, that the kitchen-garden ought
to be as near the farm-houses as may be, in order
to save the carriage of dung to it, and of green
food to the cattle.</P>
<P>There is one accommodation of a farm I relish
greatly, because it has a charitable view. Why
not reserve work for superannuated labourers that
requires little strength, cutting down weeds for
example, weeding hedges, filling up ruts in a
road with small stones, tending cattle in the house
during winter, gathering dung, and such like?
Half-pay would help them to live; and gentle
work would keep them in spirits, preventing a
<PB N="277" REF="303"/>
langour that sits down heavy on the industrious,
when reduced to idleness.</P>
<P>It will not be an unnecessary addition, to exa∣mine
what sort of farm is proper for a wright, a
smith, a mason, or a weaver. A mechanic, it is
true, makes more by his art than by husbandry-work:
but if he have no farm to depend on, he
must go far to market for provisions, and will be
ill provided after all. At any rate, he must have
a small farm for maintaining a horse and two
cows: the former for carrying timber, iron, coals,
&amp;c.; the latter for milk.</P>
<P>The quantity of land necessary for supplying all
his wants, cannot be less than six acres where the
soil is good, and more where it is indifferent. To
prevent the expence of winter-herding, the field
must be inclosed; but divisions are not necessary.
It ought to be cropped as follows: a third part in
red clover, with a small proportion of ryegrass to
thicken the crop: a third part in oats, turnip, and
potatoes; the remaining third in barley and lint;
the lint to be sown where the potatoes grew the
former year.</P>
<P>To save the expence and trouble of carrying
clover to the cattle in the house, and of carrying
dung to the field, let a moveable trough be pro∣vided
twelve feet long, the side spars eighteen
inches high. Bind the horse and two cows to
stakes at the side of the trough, and let them have
plenty of clover. To defend them from heat and
<PB N="278" REF="304"/>
from flies, cover them with a shed, the roof of
which may be an old sail, or any other coarse
cloth, supported upon wooden pillars. The trough
and shed moved from place to place, will spread
the dung equally, and save carriage of the clover.
The wife or maid-servant, when she milks the
cows, fills the trough with clover; and the rich∣ness
of the food will make it proper to milk them
thrice a-day. The oat and barley crops need no
instruction. The turnip is an excellent food for
the cows in spring after calving; and there ought
to be as many potatoes as to serve the family the
year round. As for the flax, all the ground that
can possibly be spared ought to be cropped with
it; because every person of the family may be
profitably employed, upon dressing it in winter-evenings
when no other work is on hand, and
when otherwise they would be idle.</P>
<P>The oat and barley straw, with what clover has
been saved, will suffice for winter-food to the
horse and two cows. And the dung that can be
thus gathered, will suffice for the turnip and potato
crops. As the lint succeeds the potato-crop, it
will require no dung.</P>
<P>The great loss of a small farm that cannot main∣tain
a plough is, that the land is never dressed in
season. No neighbouring farmer will part with
his plough, even for hire, till his own work be
finished. This loss may be prevented by placing
two mechanics together. If good-natured and so∣ciable,
<PB N="279" REF="305"/>
they will go on pleasantly with their two
horses in a plough, and will have always the sea∣son
at command for ploughing. The great ad∣vantage
of such a plan, both for frugality and pro∣fit,
will subdue even bad humour, and make the
neighbours go on cordially together.</P>
<P>With respect to a weaver, some Irish pamphlets
declare against his having any land to cultivate;
for the reason above mentioned, that there is
more profit by weaving than by farming. But
this reason is not satisfactory. Weaving, a seden∣tary
occupation, requires at times field-labour for
sake of health; and it is not consistent with hu∣manity,
that profit only should be the object, with∣out
regard to health or comfort. It may at the
same time be doubted, whether it will not be pro∣fitable
to preserve a weaver a few years longer in
health and vigour. These considerations must
weigh, even where there is a market at hand for
provisions, which is a rare case in Scotland. But
as a weaver has no occasion for a horse, four acres
are sufficient for his purpose, to be cropped in
three divisions as above mentioned.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">WHAT A CORN-FARM OUGHT TO YIELD
IN RENT.</HEAD>
<P>IN leasing a farm, it appears an equitable bar∣gain,
that after a moderate allowance to the
tenant for his skill and industry, and after deduct∣ing
the expence of management, the remainder
of the product, or its value in money, ought to go
to the landlord as rent. In order then to ascer∣tain
the rent of a farm, the particulars must be
stated with which the crop ought to be burdened.
This will be found not an easy task: but the fol∣lowing
considerations, will pave the way to it.</P>
<P>The labour bestowed on dressing land for a
crop, is evidently a burden on the crop. But by
what rule is that labour to be estimated? If the
labour of every man and every horse were to be
stated at so much per day, it would encourage the
tenant to loiter, instead of being diligent; the
crop would be exhausted by the expence, and no∣thing
be left to the landlord. The nature of the
agreement between landlord and tenant, suggests
a more proper method of stating the account.
The tenant furnishes the servants and cattle; but
as they labour for the landlord, the expence must
be defrayed by him. The article for servants hi∣red
by the year or half-year, is simple: their wages
<PB N="281" REF="307"/>
must be stated as a burden on the product. The
article for the labouring cattle is more intricate.
Were the price of every beast to be stated, bought
by the tenant during his lease in place of those
that fail, it would occasion much trouble, and o∣pen
a door to fraud. The only practicable way,
is to allow the tenant a yearly sum, for the use
of his cattle, and for upholding them. For the
former he cannot be offered less than five <HI>per
cent.;</HI> because that sum he would be intitled to,
upon converting his stocking into money. As to
the latter, cattle are a perishable commodity; and
every farmer reckons upon the expence of re∣newing
his stock every ten years. To answer this
expence, the tenant ought to be allowed yearly ten
<HI>per cent.</HI> of the value of his stock; which sum in
ten years amounts to no more but that value. But
this is not all: a poor tenant who commonly has
nothing to depend on but his stock, must be pre∣served
from risk. His stock of labouring cattle
ought to be insured to him; and the insurance
cannot well be yearly under four or five <HI>per cent.</HI>
Upon the whole, for furnishing labouring cattle,
and upholding them, he is well intitled to twenty
<HI>per cent.</HI> yearly of their value; and this sum is
another deduction from the yearly product.</P>
<P>In this account must also be comprehended the
farm-instruments, ploughs, carts, &amp;c.; for these
must be renewed from time to time, still more
frequently than the labouring cattle. But cows
<PB N="282" REF="308"/>
and calves, and other particulars that are kept for
the benefit of the tenant solely, are not to be com∣prehended;
because they produce nothing to the
landlord.</P>
<P>What the tenant himself ought to be allowed
out of the product, for bestowing his whole time
upon the service of his landlord, is far from being
obvious. A tenant is in a higher class than a
hired servant or day-labourer; and may well rank
with a shopkeeper in a town, or a manufacturer
in a village. To judge by that comparison, his
allowance ought not to be under L. 36 or L. 40
yearly; supposing the corn, one grain with an∣other,
to give ten shillings per boll, which is the
price to be understood in every branch of this in∣quiry.
Nor is this a high allowance, considering
that after maintenance of the family, and educa∣tion
of the children, very little will be saved. But
here nature strikes out against this allowance.
Men are ambitious of power, the lower classes not
excepted. Every day-labourer who has saved a
little money by penury, immediately commences
farmer. He purchases his labouring cattle upon
credit, and depends on his little stock for what
else he wants. What tickles him, is not inde∣pendence
only, but to have the command of ser∣vants
and horses. Many a poor man is involved
thus in difficulties, who lived more at ease while
he was a day-labourer. One unacquainted with
this scene, would be amazed to hear, that in many
<PB N="283" REF="309"/>
places of Scotland, there are two, three, some∣times
four, tenants about a single plough, in a
poor farm that perhaps does not pay L. 5 yearly.
Were it not the ambition of being tenants, better
it would be for them to labour at 8 d. per day.
By this ambitious propensity in my countrymen,
much less is made by farming, than the tenant is
intitled to from the nature of his profession. It
is believed, that those who are confined to one
plough, do not at a medium clear more than
L. 20 yearly; which exceeds not the wages of an
ordinary mechanic, and is not far above what a
day-labourer earns. The landlord indeed profits
by this propensity; because the less that is drawn
of the product by the tenant, the more is left to
the landlord: but the profit is only temporary;
for the landlord suffers in the main, by being ob∣liged
to lower his rent for the encouragement of
more vigorous tenants.</P>
<P>However this be, the rent of small farms de∣termines
the rent of every farm; for a landlord,
who draws of rent L. 80 from two small tenants,
will not easily be persuaded to set both farms to
one tenant for L. 75. But it falls out luckily
here, that there is encouragement to great te∣nants,
without encroaching on the landlord's in∣terest.
A lease of six small farms will intitle him
to the share of each of the former possessors, which
is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 120, without lowering the landlord's rent
one farthing.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="310"/>
I need scarce mention, that the expence of seed
is a burden upon the annual product; as also the
expence of shearing, threshing, &amp;c. as far as
these articles are performed by strangers hired for
that purpose. And to save a vague account, a
lump sum ought to be stated for these particulars.</P>
<P>It falls in here to be considered, whether the
nature of the soil, good or bad, makes any dif∣ference
upon the tenant's share of the product.
One thing is evident, that if he be not enabled to
live by his farm, he must take himself to some
other occupation; and to live with any degree of
comfort, less he cannot have than L. 20 yearly,
however mean the soil may be. On the other
hand, he is intitled to no benefit from the fertility
of the soil; because it adds neither to the expence
of culture nor of living. Fertility is a quality of
land; and a subject belongs to the proprietor with
all its qualities. As fertility depends not on the
tenant's skill nor industry, he is intitled to no be∣nefit
from it.</P>
<P>For the same reason, any saving in the expence
of culture ought to benefit the landlord only; as
where, by the construction of a plough, two
draught-horses are sufficient instead of three or
four: or where oxen are used instead of horses:
the gain of the tenant is not lessened by such sa∣vings.</P>
<P>On the other hand, where a tenant, by supe∣rior
skill or extreme diligence, raises on an acre a
<PB N="285" REF="311"/>
bushel more than usual, the profit ought to be
his own: it is owing to himself, not to the ferti∣lity
of the soil.</P>
<P>Lastly, Suppose a lime-quarry, or a bed of
shell-marl, to be discovered within a farm, or near
it, it ought to be considered as an article for the
landlord, in giving a new lease. The profit ought
to be his, stating only an allowance to the tenant
for the expence he lays out upon the manure. It
is in effect adding to the fertility of the soil;
which, for the reason above given, ought to be∣nefit
the landlord only.</P>
<P>Let us illustrate these general views, by stating
an account of particulars. Take a farm of sixty
acres; which being partly in pasture, may be ma∣naged
by a single plough with four horses. I be∣gin
with computing the rent of such a farm, where
the product in corn and grass is at a medium e∣qual
to the value of five bolls per acre, or 50 s.
amounting upon the whole farm to L. 150. Add
the profit of ten winterers fed with straw, which
may be stated at L. 5. The whole sum drawn
out of the land is L. 155; from which is to be
deducted the tenant's share, and every other ar∣ticle
of expence: the balance is the landlord's
rent. Let us enter into the several articles of de∣duction.</P>

<P>Here an unexpected discovery is made of very
great importance in farming; which is, that a
farm yielding no more but an average of 3 1/2 bolls
per acre, had better be wholly set for pasture.
For supposing it in that shape to yield no more
but 5 s. per acre, which is L. 15 for the whole,
the clear profit is greater than when the farm is
in corn; and the landlord draws more rent: he
draws the whole L. 15, as land set in pasture is
not burdened with any expence. This discovery
may be of use to many a poor tenant, who labours
<PB N="288" REF="314"/>
and toils at the plough from year to year, to his
own loss. If his farm produce not more than 3 1/2
bolls per acre, better abandon the plough, turn
his farm into pasture, and sit idle.</P>
<P>But if a tenant can reduce his labouring cattle
to two horses or two oxen, the saving will be so
considerable as to make it his own interest as well
as that of the landlord to continue his corn∣crops.
The saving amounts to L. 16, 16 s. year∣ly,
not to mention the driver; which throws the
balance against pasture no less than L. 12, 18 s.
supposing the farm in pasture to yield but 5 s. per
acre. This saving benefits the tenant during his
lease, and benefits the landlord in giving a new
lease. But supposing the product to be but 3
bolls per acre, the balance turns clearly for pa∣sture,
after every saving that can be made when
such a farm is in corn.</P>
<P>At the same time, however fertile the soil may
be, the man who takes in lease a made farm, can∣not
expect more but to live comfortably. If his
heart be set on wealth, it is not to be found but
in land recently broken up from the state of na∣ture,
where there is scope for great and lasting
improvements.</P>
<P>This speculation ought to be a ruling motive
with every gentleman of a land-estate, to encou∣rage
improvements with all his might. The ex∣pence
of culture is not less in a mean soil than in
the most fertile; and we now see, that the ex∣pence
<PB N="289" REF="315"/>
of the former cuts so deep into the corn-product,
as to leave little or nothing to the land∣lord.
In our corn-counties, it is not difficult, nor
extremely expensive, to make the land carry two
or three bushels per acre more than the ordinary
product; the value of which goes entirely to the
landlord as rent.</P>
<P>Upon a review, the only doubtful article is the
5 <HI>per cent.</HI> stated for ensuring the tenant's la∣bouring
cattle. It appears to me, that a yearly
sum precisely equivalent to the chance of losing
cattle, is not sufficient; for if the chance go a∣gainst
the poor tenant, he is undone. Something
for insurance he ought to have; more or less is
arbitrary. But supposing it to be 3 <HI>per cent.</HI> or
2 only, it will be easy to frame the computation
upon that supposition.</P>

<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THEORY OF AGRICULTURE.</HEAD>
<P>THE operations of men can be easily tra∣ced:
they are confined to the surface of
bodies. The operations of nature, go∣ing
far out of sight, reach even elementary par∣ticles.
In explaining therefore natural effects, we
ought to rest satisfied with the immediate causes,
leaving the more remote to superior beings. In
order to unfold the theory of agriculture, the na∣ture
of plants ought to be studied, their nourish∣ment,
their propagation: we ought to be ac∣quainted
with all the different soils, and in what
manner they are affected by weather and climate.
And yet, after all our researches, how imperfect
remains our knowledge of these particulars! For∣tunately,
agriculture depends not much on the∣ory.
If it did, baneful it would be to the hu∣man
race: skilful practitioners would be rare;
and agriculture, upon which we depend for food,
would, by frequent disappointments, be prose∣cuted
with little ardour. Notwithstanding there∣fore
that the theory of agriculture is still in its in∣fant
state, the practice has made considerable ad∣vances,
<PB N="291" REF="317"/>
especially in Britain; and there are rules
founded on experience, that seldom mislead when
applied by a sagacious farmer. In theory, the
deepest penetration preserves not writers from
wide differences. In practice, the ignorant only
differ: sagacious farmers generally agree; giving
allowance only for varieties in soil and climate.</P>
<P>But admitting experience to be our only sure
guide, theory however ought not to be rejected,
even by a practical farmer. Man is made for
knowledge; and he has a natural curiosity to
learn the reason of every thing. Why not in∣dulge
an appetite, that will amuse, and may bring
forth instruction? In dipping into theory, a com∣plete
system is far from my thoughts, and far a∣bove
my reach. I venture only to select a few
particulars, that have an immediate influence on
practice. These will be understood by every
gentleman who joins reading to experience; and
in doubtful cases may help to direct his opera∣tions.
I give warning before hand, that I pre∣tend
to no demonstration. However positively I
may happen to express myself in the glow of com∣position,
my best arguments are but conjectural.
Those that are here displayed appear to me highly
probable; and if they appear so to the reader, I
can have no farther wish.</P>
<P>The subjects handled in this part of my work
are divided into three chapters. In the first are
contained some preliminary observations that have
<PB N="292" REF="318"/>
an immediate influence on practice. In the se∣cond
are handled the food of plants, and ferti∣lity
of soils. And the third is upon the means of
fertilizing soils.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>TO be an expert farmer, it is not necessary that
a gentleman be a profound chymist. There
are however certain chymical principles relative to
agriculture, that no farmer of education ought to
be ignorant of. Such as appear the most neces∣sary
shall be here stated, beginning with elective
attraction and repulsion, which make a capital ar∣ticle
in the science of agriculture as well as of
chymistry.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>1. ELECTIVE ATTRACTION AND REPULSION.</HEAD>
<P>BY an inherent quality in matter, every particle
of it is endued with a tendency to unite with e∣very
other particle; and this tendency is termed
<HI>gravity.</HI> Beside gravity, common to all matter,
there is in some bodies a peculiar tendency to u∣nite
together; acids and alkalis for example, air
and water, clay and water. The particular bo∣dies
thus disposed to unite, may be termed <HI>cor∣responding
bodies;</HI> and as such disposition or
<PB N="293" REF="319"/>
tendency has a resemblance to choice in voluntary
agents, it is termed <HI>elective attraction.</HI></P>
<P>The power of gravity extends as far as matter
exists. Elective attraction, on the contrary, is
confined within a very narrow space: it operates
not but between bodies in contact, or approaching
nearly to it.</P>
<P>Even in the largest bodies, such as the sun and
planets, every particle of matter operates by its
power of gravity. But elective attraction has no
sensible effect between large bodies, no particle
operating but those in contact, or near it. It has
no sensible effect therefore but between bodies
that mix together. The attraction of gravity be∣tween
two bodies is in the direct proportion to
the quantity of their matter: elective attraction is
in the inverse proportion; which in plain lan∣guage
is saying, that the less bodies are, the great∣er
is their elective attraction. Between large bo∣dies
accordingly, elective attraction in opposition
to gravity is as nothing: between very small bo∣dies
in contact, or near it, it is far superior to
gravity.</P>
<P>The power of gravity in each particle of matter
corresponds to the quantity of matter in the uni∣verse:
double that quantity, and you double the
power of gravity in every particle: annihilate the
half, and the power of gravity is reduced to the
half. Elective attraction, on the contrary, is in∣variable.
It can hold but a certain quantity of
<PB N="294" REF="320"/>
corresponding matter: bring more within its
sphere of attraction, it has no effect. Thus, wa∣ter
will hold salt till it be saturated; or, in other
words, till every particle of the water be in con∣tact
with a particle of salt. Add more salt: it is
not attracted, but falls to the bottom of the vessel.
The same is observable in clay saturated with wa∣ter:
what water is added falls to the bottom.</P>
<P>Elective attraction between some corresponding
bodies, is more vigorous than between others.
Acids and alkalis attract each other violently, and
mix intimately. Such is the case also of salt and
water: salt is so thoroughly dissolved in water as
to vanish out of sight, leaving the water trans∣parent
as before<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have Sir Isaac Newton's authority, that the o∣pacity of a body is owing to the reflection or refraction of the rays of light at its surface; and that the particles of a body must be of a certain size to reflect or refract the rays of light. A body composed of smaller particles, is transparent. Water, composed of very small particles, is transparent: throw salt into it, it maintains its transparency, having the power to dissolve salt into very small parts; and the same happens with respect to any other substance that is dissolvable by water into very small parts.</NOTE>. There is an elective attrac∣tion
between air and water: neither of them in
its natural state is ever found pure without the
other; and yet their mixture seldom disturbs their
transparency. In the instances above given, e∣lective
<PB N="295" REF="321"/>
attraction prevails over gravity, which has
not power to separate the heavier body from the
lighter. Water and clay attract each other, but
with less vigour: powdered clay is suspended in
water; but the elective attraction is not so strong
as to dissolve the clay: it continues visible in the
mixture, and makes the water turbid. Their
mutual attraction yields by degrees to the repeat∣ed
impulses of gravity: the clay subsides, leaving
the water transparent as originally. But each par∣ticle
of clay draws along with it the particles of
water with which it is in contact. And accor∣dingly
when the water is poured off, the clay re∣mains
moist and soft.</P>
<P>Both air and clay attract water; and when
they act in opposition, it is of importance to know
which of them prevails. Where clay is so wet as
that many particles of the water are not reached
by the attraction of the clay, such loose particles
are attracted by the air without opposition. Even
particles of water, barely within the sphere of at∣traction
of the clay, are drawn up by the superior
attraction of dry air. But the air must be both
hot and dry, to carry off water that is in actual
contact with the clay. This I conjecture never
happens in pure clay, unless the heat be intense.</P>
<P>All sorts of earth do not attract water equally:
the attraction of clay is the strongest, of sand the
weakest. Between these extremes, soils vary in
every degree with respect to their power of at∣tracting
<PB N="296" REF="322"/>
and holding water. Even clays differ.
Some clays attract water vigorously, others less.
This is manifested from the time that is taken in
drying; as the clay that attracts the most vigo∣rously
will be the latest of parting with its water.
I witnessed an experiment of different clays put
in shallow vessels, and soaked with water. They
differed in the times of drying at least a fortnight.
I take it for granted, that the clay which retains
its water the longest, will turn the hardest after it
is dry; for both effects depend on the force of
the elective attraction.</P>
<P>It is laid down above, that elective attraction is
the greatest between the smallest bodies. Hence
an important lesson in agriculture, which may be
justly esteemed the corner-stone of the fabric, that
the more pulverized clay is, the more water it
will hold. A lump of dry clay immersed in wa∣ter,
carries none away but what is attracted by
the surface-particles. Pulverize this lump, and
give free admission to the water; let it be divided
into a million of parts or into ten million: each
particle however minute will hold a certain pro∣portion
of water; and this process may be car∣ried
on as far as clay and water can be divided by
the hand of man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Evelyn dug a deep hole in the ground, reduced the earth to powder, and put it back into the hole▪ After a time, the powdered earth was found moist to the bottom, the ground round it remaining hard and dry.</NOTE>. Now as earth serves only to
<PB N="297" REF="323"/>
retain moisture, and to furnish it gradually to its
plants, the chief object of husbandry is, by plough∣ing
and harrowing to pulverize clay, and every
other soil that requires it. Clay, it is true, is di∣visible
into so many parts as readily to unite with
water into a very hard mass; witness carse-clay,
of which afterward. But there is no danger of
such excess in common clay, which is composed
of particles more gross than those of carse-clay.
In common clay, there is no other limit to bene∣ficial
pulveration, but the expence of the work.</P>
<P>There is also observable an elective attraction
between earth and air. Much air is found in
earth, because gravity concurs with the elective
attraction to bring down air. But very little earth
is found in air; because in that case gravity coun∣teracts
the elective attraction.</P>
<P>A plant attracts air and water, and is attracted
by them. The latter attraction is without effect,
because plants are fixed to a place. The former
is clearly displayed by Dr Hales in his statical es∣says,
containing the best conducted experiments
that are known, next to those of Sir Isaac Newton
upon light and colours. There is not the slightest
evidence, that plants attract any dry matter, how∣ever
pulverized. Set the most healthy vegetable
in dried earth, or in dust gathered from the high∣way:
it dies, and the earth remains as weighty
as before. It is clear then, that a plant can re∣ceive
no nourishment but what is conveyed to it
<PB N="298" REF="324"/>
by air or water; and consequently that nothing
can serve as its nourishment but what is soluble in
these elements. Clay is not soluble even in wa∣ter:
it is easily separated from water by the force
of gravity; and its particles are probably too
gross to ente<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with water into the mouths of a
plant.</P>
<P>Black bodies attract and absorb rays of the sun.
A black wall facing the sun, is hotter even to the
touch than a wall of any other colour; and hence
the practice of blacking fruit-walls. Soil made
black by high culture, attracts and absorbs rays
of the sun in plenty; and turns remarkably hotter
than soil of any other colour.</P>
<P>That there is a mutual attraction between par∣ticles
of water, appears from the globules it
forms itself into in falling; from the globules
it forms itself into when dropt gently upon a
dry board; and from its rising above the lips
when gently poured into a glass. But I am un∣certain
whether there be any elective attraction
between particles of clay: put dry powdered clay
into a vessel, and press it together at pleasure; it
comes out with little or no cohesion. Water is
the cement that hardens particles of clay into a so∣lid
lump. Where the water superabounds so as
that part of it only can be in contact with the
clay, the remainder continues fluid, and the mix∣ture
i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a soft mas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. But where by evaporation no
more is left but what is in contact with the clay,
<PB N="299" REF="325"/>
evaporation is at an end, because water is attract∣ed
more strongly by clay, than by air in its or∣dinary
state; and the mass hardens by degrees.
A green turf from a moist soil, falls to pieces in
handling. Let it lie a few days to dry, it becomes
tough and firm. The like happens in a mixture
of quick lime, sand, and water. The water con∣tinues
for a time fluid; and the mass is soft and
ductile. Upon evaporation of the superfluous
moisture, the elective attraction operates; and
the mass turns hard like a stone. A mixture of
clay and sand moistened with water, continues
long soft; but in time turns exceedingly hard:
the pier of Eyemouth in Berwickshire is built of
a plumcake stone, composed of pebbles, clay,
and sand, cemented with water; yet no stone is
harder, nor less affected with the sea-air. Plaister
of Paris is composed of gypsum and water; which
are mixed together to a certain consistence; and
the mass, still fluid, is poured into a mould: in
a few minutes it acquires a stony hardness. A
composition of that kind is used for bridges in the
island Minorca: no sooner is one stone of the arch
joined to another, than it bears a man to add a
third. The cement here operates almost instan∣taneously:
water operates flower in hardening
clay; and still slower in hardening a mixture of
lime and sand.</P>
<P>These differences depend probably on the more
<PB N="300" REF="326"/>
or less vigour of the elective attraction. As the
superfluous moisture evaporates, the correspond∣ing
bodies approach nearer and nearer to each o∣ther,
and at last unite in one mass. This opera∣tion
is slow in proportion to the vigour of the e∣lective
attraction; and the slower the operation
is, the mass becomes the harder. Some sorts of
clay attract water more vigorously than others;
and when the superfluous moisture is exhaled,
which is done very slowly, the mass turns hard in
proportion. Carse-clay affords a good instance.
It is composed of the finest parts of natural clay,
washed off by running water: it is deposited in
flat ground where the water stagnates; and is ac∣cumulated
by degrees till the ground rise above
the stream. Carse-lands are generally near the
sea, and the reflux of the tide contributes to the
effect. By the minuteness of its parts, carse-clay
mixes so intimately with water as to give the e∣lective
attraction its utmost efficacy. Thus carse-clay,
which is extremely wet in winter, becomes
so hard in a droughty spring as to yield but a very
scanty crop, unless the summer be moist. In a
dry summer, fissures are every where seen in it,
some of them so wide as to admit a man's hand.
Common clay, composed of grosser parts, never
hardens so much. Hence it is, that of all crops
beans thrive the best in carse-clay: the tap root
pushes vigorously into the hard soil; and finds
<PB N="301" REF="327"/>
more water locked up there than in common
clay<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The clay in the Carse of Gowry, of Falkirk, and of Stirling, is much of the same nature. When dry, it is white, less weighty than common clay, pure without sand, and divides into very minute parts. The last-mentioned quality, which gives elective attraction its greatest efficacy, makes it cake at the surface when stir∣red before winter. It makes it also in drought unite in∣to very hard clods, harder than those of common clay, composed of grosser parts. As all clays hold water in proportion to the minuteness of their parts, frost acts more vigorously upon carse-clay than upon the ordinary sort; because frost acts upon bodies in proportion to the quantity of water in them.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This tendency to hardness in clay-soil, is a great
obstruction to fertility; and to counteract that
bad quality, I know no means more effectual than
frequent ploughing and harrowing. In that view
partly, the harrows above described were invent∣ed:
they divide the soil into minute parts: every
part holds a particle of water ready for the nou∣rishment
of plants; and the soil at the same time
is kept open, inviting the roots to extend them∣selves
in all directions.</P>
<P>The time that water takes to harden clay, will
explain several articles. I mention first an article
of importance, which is the different effects of
ploughing clay wet or dry. The running a
plough through clay soaked in water, produces
no change. Upon evaporation of the looser parts
<PB N="302" REF="328"/>
of the water, the vacuities left render the soft
mass compressible. To compress it in that state
would have the effect to keep in the remainder of
the loose water from evaporating, at the same
time give the elective attraction its strongest effect,
and accelerate the hardening contrary to the very
intention of ploughing. Let not the plough be
applied till the air has performed its part by draw∣ing
off every particle of water that is not in con∣tact
with the clay. Nick that minute for apply∣ing
the plough: the clay still soft is easily divided:
a new surface is laid open to the air: evapora∣tion
is renewed; and by every ploughing and har∣rowing
the soil turns drier, and at the same time
is preserved free and open.</P>
<P>The next article I shall mention, is the making
brick. Where air and water are brought into
contact by elective attraction, the process is com∣pleted:
for they never harden into a solid body.
But after clay and water are brought into con∣tact,
the process goes on till they be firmly united.
In the commencement of that process, the air
may be rendered so hot and dry, as to overcome
the elective attraction, and suck up the whole
moisture, leaving the clay dry with little or no
cohesion. Wet clay put into a hot fire, does not
harden, but falls into a burnt powder. The su∣perfluous
moisture must be evaporated, and the
cohesion be considerably advanced, before it can
be hardened into a brick by fire. In that condi∣tion,
<PB N="303" REF="329"/>
the elective attraction prevails over the hot∣test
air. Form dough into a thin cake, and lay
it upon a plate of iron over a fire: the moisture
suddenly evaporates; and no more is left but
what is barely sufficient to keep the parts slightly
together. Give the elective attraction time to o∣perate:
the cake turns hard like a brick.</P>
<P>Nature operates by elective repulsion as well as
by elective attraction; but as agriculture seems
to depend little upon the former, I shall say but a
word upon it. There is an elective repulsion in
the particles of air, which gives them a tendency
to recede from each other; and this operation is
greatly invigorated by heat. Heat therefore pul∣verizes
the soil by rarifying the air contained in it,
which moves the particles of earth out of their
place. Frost has a similar effect, by rarifying the
water contained in a soil. Black, as observed a∣bove,
attracts and absorbs rays of the sun; and
therefore black is the best colour of soil. The
more parts clay or loam is divided into, the black∣er
it is. Whatever be the colour of the soil where
potatoes are s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, it is rendered black by that crop.
A potato-crop is a powerful pulverizer: the bul∣bous
roots swelling without intermission, keep the
surrounding earth in constant motion, and divide
more effectually than a plough or a harrow. White
repels the rays of the sun; and upon that account
is a bad colour for soil. Pulverizing by dunging,
ploughing, and harrowing, is a sure means to
<PB N="304" REF="330"/>
convert white soil into black; which is an addi∣tional
motive for being diligent in these opera∣tions.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>2. PLANTS HAVE A FACULTY TO ACCOMMO∣DATE
THEMSELVES TO THEIR SITUA∣TION.</HEAD>
<P>ALL trees are provided by nature with a tap∣root,
fit for piercing the hardest soil; and a tree
growing in clay exerts great energy on that root.
It lessens in vigour and size where a tree grows in
loam; and lateral roots prevail more, which are
spread all around for procuring food. In very
light soil, the tap-root is very small; and a tree
growing in water has many roots, but not the
least appearance of a tap-root. Nature is won∣derful
in all her works. A plant here acts as if
endued with the sagacity of a thinking being: in
this instance, and in many that will be unfolded
afterward, vegetable life seems to be not far re∣mote
from animal life.</P>
<P>The constitution of a plant depends greatly on
the soil it is bred in. Custom becomes a second
nature; and it appears no less difficult, to trans∣plant
a tree from the soil where it was reared to
an opposite soil, than to transplant a tree from a
hot to a cold climate. However fitted by nature a
tree may be for growing in a loose soil; yet if
planted young in a stiff soil, it acquires a consti∣tution
<PB N="305" REF="331"/>
accommodated to that soil; and its nature
is so far altered, as in a measure to disqualify it
for being transplanted into a loose soil. Take a
vegetable that has been reared in water, and plant
it in a soil even the most proper for it by nature:
it will infallibly die. In general, plants reared in
water will not grow in earth; and plants reared
in earth will not grow in water. Hence it is,
that where water stagnates ten or twelve inches
under the surface, the plants reared in that
ground turn sickly when their roots reach the
water. Yet these plants would have flourished in
pure water, had they been accustomed to it
early.</P>
<P>But may not a plant acquire a constitution, fit∣ting
it for growing partly in earth partly in wa∣ter?
Trees grow vigorously on the brink of a ri∣ver,
where some of the roots must be in water.
At the seat of Mr Burnet of Kemnay, ten miles
from Aberdeen, a kitchen-garden, a flower-gar∣den,
a wilderness of trees indigenous and exotic,
are all in a peat-moss, where water stagnates from
one foot to two under the surface.</P>
<P>The same faculty is exerted to remedy an incon∣venient
situation. A tree that grows without
shelter, resists wind by the length of its roots:
the roots of the same tree, are commonly much
shorter in a sheltered place. In the Leeward
islands, the east wind is almost constant; and the
trees there, extend their roots much farther to
<PB N="306" REF="332"/>
that quarter, than to any other. A tree overtop∣ed
by neighbouring trees, directs its course to a
a space that is free; and then mounts up perpen∣dicularly
according to its nature. Set a plant in
a room that has no light but from a single hole in
the wall: instead of rising perpendicularly, it di∣rects
its course toward the light, passes through
the hole into open air, and then mounts upward.
The power of remedying a bad situation, is re∣remarkable
in seed of every kind. A seed con∣tains
the plant in miniature, with a <HI>plumula</HI> that
tends upward, and a <HI>radicle</HI> that tends down∣ward.
Put a seed into the ground with its plu∣mula
above and its radicle below as the piant
grows, the former ascends and the latter descends,
both perpendicularly. Invert the position of the
seed, the plumula shoots not downward, nor the
radicle upward: they twist round the seed, till the
former gain the open air, and the latter pierce
into the ground. Providence is wonderful in e∣very
operation: were not provision made for the
springing of seed in every position, agriculture ne∣ver
could have made any progress<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See more about the powers and faculties of plants, Appendix, N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A change of constitution in plants, occasioned
by their situation, is commonly transmitted to
their offspring. Plants propagated from seed pro∣duced
in a warm sandy soil, grow fast in whatever
<PB N="307" REF="333"/>
soil the seed is sown, and have early flowers.
Plants from seed produced in a cold stiff soil, are
late of growing, even in a warm soil. Plants from
seed produced in a very rich soil, grow vigorously
in a poor soil. Plants from seed of a poor soil,
grow weakly even in the richest soil, and produce
small seed. In the rainy harvest 1744, oats that
grew in a warm light soil, sprouted in the shock
ten days more early than oats that grew in a
cold soil; though both were produced from the
same seed, and both were cut down the same day.
Hence the advantage of changing seed from a
warm to a cold soil. It may be true, that seed
from a warm soil will not grow so quickly in a
cold soil as in a warm soil; but it will always grow
more quickly than seed from a cold soil. To rear
trees in a middling soil, it is certainly right to
take the young plants from a richer soil. But is
it right to transplant them from a rich soil to one
that is poor? They have, it is true, a tendency
to grow vigorously. But will they not be dwarf∣ish
in the poor soil, which cannot afford them suf∣ficiency
of nourishment to support their vigour?</P>
<P>That a plant may change its constitution by
being transplanted into a climate a little warmer
or colder, is certain; and the change of constitu∣tion
is still more easy when the plant is raised from
seed. Thus plants of one climate may, by gra∣dual
change of place in successive generations,
prosper in a very different climate. When Galen
<PB N="308" REF="334"/>
the physician lived, the peach was too delicate for
the air of Italy. It has been creeping northward
slowly; and, even in Britain at present, it is of a
good flavour, if artfully cultivated. The cherry
tree was brought by Lucullus from the Lesser
Asia to Rome, as a great rarity; and now it bears
good fruit even in Scotland. The blessings of
Providence are distributed with an equal hand.
We are enabled to remedy by industry the natu∣ral
defects of our soil and situation: are we less
happy than those who owe all to soil and situa∣tion?
If wheat, if fruits, if cabbage, if colly∣flower,
were confined to their native climates,
what would Britain be? Iceland would be not
much inferior.</P>
<P>But though a change of constitution is produ∣ced
as far as necessary for accommodating a plant
to a different climate, yet it is observable, that
in other respects the original constitution remains
entire. I give for one instance the flowering of
plants. A plant translated into a different cli∣mate,
preserves its original season of flowering,
unless prevented by some powerful cause. The
climate of the shores of Spain and Portugal,
suits the flowering of the <HI>laurustinus</HI> in De∣cember
and January; nor is the cold of Scot∣land
in these months sufficient to deter him from
his season. I mean the milder parts; for in the
higher and more rigerous parts, the cold puts
him past his season, and prevents his spreading
<PB N="309" REF="335"/>
any flower till April. Dr Walker says, that were
he to see a <HI>laurustinus</HI> flowering with us in win∣ter,
and had never heard of the shrub, he would
without scruple pronounce it no native of this
country; and that for the same reason he would
deny the <HI>arbutus</HI> to be a native of Ireland, or
the whin, of Scotland. He adds pleasantly, that
the flowering of these shrubs with us, is an out∣landish
fashion; and that no sensible Scotch plant
will ever think of such a thing.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>3. CHANGE OF SEED, AND OF SPECIES.</HEAD>
<P>THE reason for changing seed from a warm to
a cold soil, is explained in the foregoing section.
But skilful farmers are not satisfied with that
single change: they frequently change seed from
a cold to a warm soil; and they seldom venture
to sow twice successively the same grain in the
same field. Such changes of seed, as well as of
species, are general; yet I know not that the
reason has been fairly explained by any writer. I
wish that what follows may give satisfaction.</P>
<P>Every species of animals has a climate adapted
to it, where it flourishes, where it grows to per∣fection,
and where it never degenerates. Propa∣gation
will go on in a less proper climate; but
the species degenerates, if not kept up by fre∣quent
recruits from the original climate. In that
view, Arabian and Barbary horses are from time
<PB N="310" REF="336"/>
to time imported into England. Nor is this a∣lone
sufficient: animals procreated of the same
breed quickly degenerate; for which reason, great
attention is given to mix different breeds. In
these particulars, plants resemble animals. Bri∣tain
is not the native climate of melons: they de∣generate
quickly, if seed be not procured from
the native climate. Where wheat grows natu∣rally,
seed dropping from the mother plant ar∣rives
at perfection, though neither seed nor soil
be changed. But as wheat is not a native of Bri∣tain,
it has a tendency to degenerate here, espe∣cially
in the northern parts; and it degenerates
rapidly, if the seed be sown year after year where
it was produced. It is not sufficient, that the
seed be taken from a different field: it ought al∣so
to be taken from a different soil. Nor is this
all: the greatest care in changing seed will not
prevent degeneracy, where the same species is
successively propagated in the same field. It is
accordingly a rule universally practised in crop∣ping
a field, that not only ought seed to be
brought from a different soil, but that the species
also ought to be changed; or, in other words,
that there ought to be a rotation of crops. This
rule holds in barley as well as in wheat; and still
more in red clover, which degenerates quickly
when sown without intermission in the same field.
It is more common to sow oats after oats; and if
that plant be a native of Britain, the practice may
<PB N="311" REF="337"/>
escape censure, especially if care be taken to
change the seed. White clover is a native of Bri∣tain,
and requires little precaution in cropping.
By Tull's mode of husbandry, tolerable crops of
wheat have been raised in the same field, fifteen or
sixteen years successively; but toward the end, the
degeneracy became visible. Artful culture will do
much; but it is not alone sufficient to prevail over
the laws of nature. This is an objection to Tull's
husbandry which that ingenious author did not
foresee. His mode however ought not to be to∣tally
rejected: to raise by artful culture, without
manure, ten or twelve crops of wheat successively
in the same field, is a capital improvement in
farms where manure is scarce.</P>
<P>The degeneracy of plants and animals in cli∣mates
where they are not natives, depends on
causes beyond the reach of human investigation.
But to a person whose curiosity is not boundless,
it may be sufficient to observe, that if every spe∣cies
of animals and plants have a climate fitted for
them, there is no reason to expect perfection in
an improper climate.</P>
<P>If what is said hold true, an extensive rotation of
crops in the same field must be good husbandry.
In a clay soil, wheat after fallow without change
of species, is not uncommon. I should imagine,
that in Scotland a crop of wheat every other year
in the same field, would be apt to degenerate.
There is an additional reason against that practice,
<PB N="312" REF="338"/>
that it requires a larger stock of working cattle
than a more varied rotation. A skilful farmer
cultivates his wheat-land in October, his beans in
January, his oats in March, his barley in April
or May, and his turnip in June or July, all with
the same cattle.</P>
<P>The particulars above set forth, are what I
judge the most essential in the theory of agricul∣ture,
and what will be found necessary for under∣standing
the subjects handled in the following
chapters. Many other particulars, less extensive
though perhaps no less material, are introduced
where there is occasion for them. Upon the
whole, in order to ease the reader, I have avoid∣ed
every article of theory that is not closely con∣nected
with practice, such as a gentleman may be
ignorant of, without suffering the imputation of
being an unskilful farmer.</P>

<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">FOOD OF PLANTS, AND FERTILITY OF
SOIL.</HEAD>
<P>IN no branch of philosophy are imagination and
conjecture more freely indulged, than in what
concerns the food of plants. Every writer erects
a system: if he can give it a plausible appearance,
he inquires no farther. It never enters into his
<PB N="313" REF="339"/>
thoughts, that his system ought to be subjected to
the rigid touchstone of facts and experiments: so
grievous a torture he cannot submit to. This re∣flection
will be justified by what follows. And to
pave the way, a general view of the nourishment
of plants shall be premised.</P>
<P>Juices imbibed through the roots and leaves of
a plant, are by an internal process converted into
sap, which, not improperly, may be called the
<HI>chyle</HI> of vegetables. Sap is in a continual oscil∣latory
motion, ascending during the heat of day,
and descending during the cold of night.</P>
<P>The sap of a plant is nearly the same, in what∣ever
soil the plant grows. Homberg filled a pot
with earth containing a portion of saltpetre: he
filled another pot with pure earth well washed.
The cresses that grew in these pots were entirely
of the same nature, equally alkalescent; what
grew in the first pot as little acid as what grew in
the second. In other two pots, prepared in the
same manner, he planted fennel, an acid plant.
The difference of earth made no difference in the
two plants. I advance a step farther. If we can
judge of sap from what of it perspires from the
plant, it is nearly the same, even in different spe∣cies.
Dr Hales collected the liquor perspired
from trees of different kinds. It was very clear:
its specific gravity was nearly the same with that
of common water; and no difference of taste
could be perceived in the different liquors. These
<PB N="314" REF="340"/>
facts are confirmed by many other experiments;
all of them evincing, that however different the
juices may be that are imbibed by a plant, yet
that the sap into which these juices are converted
is the same, or nearly the same, even in plants of
different species. If so, every plant must be en∣dowed
with proper powers; first, to imbibe
juices; next, to convert into sap the juices imbi∣bed;
and last, to convert that sap into its own
substance. With respect to the two first powers,
all plants appear to be similar. The difference of
species is carried on by the last power only, that
of converting sap into the substance of a plant.
Hence a peculiar texture, colour, smell, taste, in
each species. “Thus,” says Dr Hunter of York,
“a mass of innocent earth can give life and vi∣gour
to the bitter aloe and to the sweet cane,
to the cool house-leek and to the fiery mustard,
to the nourishing wheat and to the deadly
night-shade.” In what manner or by what
means the changes mentioned are produced, will
for ever remain a secret: they depend on ener∣gies
impenetrable by the eye, and beyond the
reach of experiment. Nor ought the farmer to
repine at the being denied the knowledge of such
matters. The province of agriculture is, to cul∣tivate
soils in such a manner as to furnish juices
in plenty: the rest must be left to nature; and
may safely be left, for she never errs in her ope∣rations.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="341"/>
Thus prepared, we proceed to examine the
most noted opinions concerning the food of plants.
A number of writers hold, that oil and salt are ca∣pital
ingredients in vegetable food; and that the
richest soils are what contain the greatest quan∣tity
of these substances. Oil and salt are found
in vegetables. “<HI>Ergo,</HI>” say these writers, “oil
and salt in the soil make the nourishment of
plants.” It may as well be reasoned, that as
all animals have blood, <HI>ergo,</HI> blood is the nou∣rishment
of animals. The same doctrine applied
to manures, has led Dr Hunter, mentioned a∣bove,
to propose a manure consisting chiefly of
oil, termed by him the <HI>oil compost;</HI> upon which
he lays great weight. Every attempt to enlighten
is praise-worthy; but such attempts seldom are
successful, unless to mislead the credulous hus∣bandman.
From what is said above, it may be
pronounced with certainty, that the oil and salt
which enter into the composition of vegetables,
are not imbibed from the earth or air; but are
formed from more simple materials, by the inter∣nal
process above mentioned. A number of plants
of different kinds, may find room for growing in
thirty or forty pounds of earth. Each of them
has an oil and a salt peculiar to itself; though
there may not be in the earth the smallest particle
of either. Nay, by repeated experiments it has
been found, that plants raised in water are com∣posed
of the same parts with those raised in earth.
<PB N="316" REF="342"/>
Led by this erroneous opinion, several writers have
conjectured, that clay-marl, a potent manure,
must contain a large proportion of salt and oil.
But it being found on trial, that it contains nei∣ther,
they were reduced to another conjecture,
that when mixed with the soil, it attracts salt and
oil from the air. And now from Dr Ainslie's ac∣curate
and elegant experiments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edinburgh Physical Essays, vol. 3. article 1.</NOTE>, that supposi∣tion
appears to have as little foundation as the o∣thers
mentioned.</P>
<P>Had due attention been given to the mouths of
roots, so small as not to be discernible by the na∣ked
eye, it must have been obvious, that oil is a
substance too gross for entering these orifices.
Chymists hold, that all oils are composed of in∣flamable
matter, mixed, by means of an acid,
with earthy and watery particles. Nay, it is held
in general, that every substance susceptible of a
chymical operation, is a compound; and it is
natural to think so, for elementary particles are
su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely too minute for our handling. Now, as
oil, far from being an element, is composed of va∣rious
parts, it is certainly too gross for the mouths
of plants. Its component parts may be sufficient∣ly
minute for admission: but then these parts are
not oil; though by an internal process they may
be converted into oil, or converted into any other
substance. Salt indeed is soluble in water, so as
<PB N="317" REF="343"/>
to become invisible; and with water consequent∣ly
it may be imbibed by plants. But salt is too
acrid to be a nourishment for plants; and if im∣bibed
in any quantity, will be destructive.</P>
<P>I have given the strictest attention to this doc∣trine,
in order to put the speculative farmer on
his guard. If he assent to what is here delivered,
it may save him much time, that would be lost in
perusing certain husbandry-books, and much la∣bour
in prosecuting idle experiments. And here
I must say again, for it cannot be too often said,
that the province of agriculture is, to prepare the
foil so as to furnish plenty of juices, leaving the
rest to nature.</P>
<P>Tull is one of the boldest theorists that have
come under my inspection. He pronounces with∣out
hesitation, that all plants live on the same
food or <HI>pabulum,</HI> which he says is pulverized
earth; and upon that foundation, he pretends to
raise perpetual crops of wheat in the same field,
by the plough alone, without manure. This in∣deed
would restore the golden age of ease and in∣dolence;
as there is no soil so barren, but what
may readily be pulverized. Tull was a man of
genius, but miserably defective in principles.
Plants imbibe water plentifully at the leaves, bark,
and roots; and with water they imbibe whatever
is dissolved in it. But earth is not soluble in wa∣ter;
and accordingly, by an experiment of Van
Helmont it appears, that earth makes no part of
<PB N="318" REF="344"/>
the food of plants. He put into a vessel two hun∣dred
pounds of dry earth; which he moistened
with rain-water, and planted in it a cutting of
willow, weighing five pounds. The mouth of
the vessel, to keep out dust, was covered with a
tin-plate, having many small holes, through which
rain or distilled water was poured from time to
time, for keeping the earth moist. The willow
weighed at the end of five years a hundred and
sixty-nine pounds and about three ounces; and
the weight would have been much greater, had
the leaves that fell the first four years been com∣puted.
At the end of the fifth year, the earth
was taken out of the vessel; and, when dried,
was found to have lost none of the original weight
excepting two ounces. Mr Boyle made a similar
experiment with gourds, the result of which was
the same<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From experiments made by Dr Woodward, he af∣firms, that earth is imbibed with water in a considerable quantity (Transactions of the Royal Society, ann. 1699). In two glass phials full of water, he put an equal quan∣tity of garden-mould. In one of them a plant of mint was set, and the earth after a time was sensibly dimi∣nished; but not in the other where no plant was set. The Doctor did not advert, that garden-mould, which perhaps for a century had been regularly dunged, must be replete with animal and vegetable particles, that are soluble in water, and with it are imbibed by plants. By the extraction of such particles, it is no wonder that the earth put into the phial was diminished. But such par∣ticles are not earth; and therefore the Doctor's expe∣riments contradict not those of Van Helmont and Mr Boyle.</NOTE>. Tull's system then is singularly un∣lucky:
<PB N="319" REF="345"/>
of all substances, earth appears to be the
least fitted for nourishing plants; and from Van
Helmont's experiment it is clear, that if at all it
enter the mouths of plants, the quantity is incon∣siderable:
of the great quantity of earth, two
ounces only were lost; and supposing these two
ounces to have been dissolved in the water and
sucked in by the plant, it was next to nothing,
considering the weight of the whole plant, which
was a hundred and sixty nine pounds.</P>
<P>Other writers, more cautious, avoid specifying
any particular substance as the food of plants:
but hold, that every species of plants require a
peculiar nourishment; and that roots imbibe those
juices only which are fitted for nourishing the
the plant. The refutation of this hypothesis will
not require many words. It is sufficient to ob∣serve,
that it is refuted by uncontestable experi∣ments.
Plants take in with air and water what∣ever
is dissolved in them, without distinguishing
the salutary from the noxious: there is not the
least appearance in any plant of a choice. Barley
has been poisoned with brimstone, and mint with
salt water. Mr George Bell student of physic in
the college of Edinburgh, an ingenious young
<PB N="320" REF="346"/>
gentleman, made the following experiments, which
he obligingly imparted to me. A number of Je∣rusalem
artichokes were set in pots filled with
pure sand. One plant was kept as a standard,
being nourished with common water only. Other
plants of the same kind, were nourished with wa∣ter
in which salt of tartar, a fixed alkali, was dis∣solved.
These grew more vigorously than the
standard plant. But by reiterated waterings,
there came to be such an accumulation of the
fixed alkali among the sand, as to make the
plants decay, and at last to die. Some plants
were nourished with water, in which sal ammo∣niac,
a volatile alkali, was dissolved. These
grew also well for some time; but, like the
former, were destroyed by the frequent reitera∣tion
of it. Weak lime-water promoted the growth
of its plants more than common water. But wa∣ter
completely saturated with quick-lime, proved
more noxious than that which contained a solu∣tion
of fixed alkali; though less than that which
contained a solution of volatile alkali. Hence ap∣pears
the hurt of overdosing a field with quick∣lime.
Urine promoted, for a long time, the
growth of its plants; and the most putrid appear∣ed
to have the strongest effect: but at last, it to∣tally
destroyed them. Water impregnated with
putrid animal and vegetable substances, did more
effectually promote the growth of its plants than
<PB N="321" REF="347"/>
any other solution; and in every stage of the pro∣gress
appeared to be salutary.</P>
<P>Rotation of crops in the same field, universally
practised, is what probably has promoted the o∣pinion
of a specific nourishment. It has been ur∣ged,
that if all plants live on the same food, the
soil must be exhausted by a succession of different
plants, as much as by a succession of the same
plant. This argument for a specific nourishment
has a formidable appearance; and in order to ob∣viate
it, I found it necessary to give peculiar at∣tention
to that branch of husbandry, which is
done above<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part 2. chap. 1. § 3.</NOTE>. It is there made evident, that
change of species is necessary, not for food, but
for preventing degeneracy. It is not want of
food that makes a horse degenerate in Britain;
and as little want of food that makes wheat dege∣nerate,
where sown without intermission in the
same field. Plants native to Britain never dege∣nerate,
though always growing in the same spot;
white clover, for example, nettles, broom, whins,
rushes, couch-grass, &amp;c. &amp;c. A bull-dog never
degenerates in Britain.</P>
<P>Animals from their food are divided into two
kinds, carnivorous and graminivorous. But I
discover no such distinction among plants. All of
them live upon the same food; and it must be so,
if the opinion of a specific nourishment be rejected.
<PB N="322" REF="348"/>
Certain substances are provided by nature for the
nourishment of plants. It is highly probable, that
a quantity was lodged originally on the surface of
this earth, for nourishing the first plants: whence
the fertility of virgin soils, such as have never
been cultivated. This vegetable matter dissolved
in water, and imbibed by plants, is communica∣ted
to animals that feed on plants, and set free
again by the death and putrefaction of these ani∣mals.
The more volatile parts are attracted by
the air: some are sucked in with air at the leaves
of plants: some are washed down to the ground
by rain; and with it are sucked in at the roots.
The less volatile parts, which the air does not at∣tract,
are dissolved in water, and with it are also
sucked in. And thus the process is continued
without end. This proposition of a common nou∣rishment,
is firmly supported by the following
facts. First, Plants of different kinds growing in
the same spot, rob and starve each other; which
could not be, if each drew from the soil a sepa∣rate
nourishment. Second, Grafting and inocu∣lating
demonstrate a common nourishment. If
the roots of the stock imbibe those juices only
that are proper for its own nourishment, the graft∣ed
plant must starve. The juices imbibed by the
former, nourish both; and these juices are by
each plant converted first into sap, and then into
its own substance. Third, Dung of putrefied ve∣getables,
of whatever kind they be, is one ho∣mogeneous
<PB N="323" REF="349"/>
substance; and yet vegetable dung
prepares the soil equally for every sort of plant.
I add a consideration of a kind that to me is al∣ways
persuasive: a common nourishment is not
only a more simple but a more wise dispensation
of Providence, than a peculiar food for each spe∣cies:
every plant grows not every where; and if
each species required a peculiar food, a vast stock
of vegetable food would remain unused; which is
not conformable to the frugality of nature, nor to
the wisdom of Providence, which makes nothing
in vain.</P>
<P>But though all plants imbibe indifferently, e∣very
substance that is dissolved in water; it fol∣lows
not, that every such substance, even where
innocent, is equally nourishing. Some substances
may be proper nourishment, some not: and it
may rationally be supposed, that the latter is
thrown off as excrement; which will so far justify
the notion of a specific nourishment. Why may
there not be a resemblance in this particular, be∣tween
plants and graminivorous animals? A
horse, an ox, a sheep, a goat, live all of them
on grass; but each of them have favourite grasses;
which they prefer before other kinds. Let ex∣periments
be made, to try what is the most salu∣tary
food for plants. A few experiments of that
kind are mentioned above; but to give satisfac∣tion,
they ought to be multiplied and extended to
plants of different kinds.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="350"/>
It is an opinion universally received, that the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ertility of a soil, depends on the quantity it con∣tains
of the food provided by nature for the nou∣rishment
of plants, whether specific or common;
that when the quantity contained in any field
is exhausted by cropping, it is restored by
the plough, by dung, or by other manure;
and that to restore an exhausted field by
such means, is the sole object of agriculture.
This opinion has a fair appearance: nor had I
ever a doubt about it, till the following consi∣derations
happened to occur. I do not much
relish the notion, that the number of plants grow∣ing
at any time on this globe, must be limited by
the quantity of vegetable food created originally
for their nourishment, nor that the quantity of
graminivorous animals must be also so limited; and
yet this must necessarily follow, if plants have no
other food but what was thus originally provided
for them. But supposing this consideration not to
weigh with others as with me, there are other con∣siderations
that cannot fail to make an impression.
Some countries produce corn and cattle, not
only for the inhabitants, but for exportation. Ac∣cording
to the present doctrine, these countries
must long ago have been reduced to absolute bar∣renness.
Egypt and Sicily were of old the gra∣naries
of Italy; and vast quantities of vegetable
food, converted into corn, were annually export∣ed
from these countries, never to return. Yet
<PB N="325" REF="351"/>
we do not find that they are less prolific than
formerly. Sicily at present does not consume
at home above the seventh part of its wheat:
the remainder is exported; and yet not the least
symptom of approaching barrenness. Consider
the endless quantity of beef exported every year
from Corke in Ireland: whatever quantity of
vegetable food may originally have been stored
up in that part of the island, it must long ago have
been totally exhausted. I urge another objection
more general. Where-ever burying under ground
is the practice, the vegetable food contained in
the bodies of human beings is totally lost, not to
mention those who perish at sea. At that rate,
there must be a gradual diminution of vegetable
food, so as that in time the whole will be ex∣hausted.
I add a fact that alone may be thought
sufficient to convince any thinking person, that
plants must be provided with some food beside
that originally created. In Scotland, there are
fields that past memory have carried successive
crops of wheat, pease, barley, oats, without a
fallow, and without manure. And that there are
such fields in England and elsewhere, is not to be
doubted. A field of nine or ten acres on the
river Carron, is still more extraordinary. Up∣on
it I saw a good crop of oats almost ripe; and
by information it was the hundred and third crop
of oats without intermission, and without manure,
as far as was known. Now, whatever be the na∣ture
<PB N="326" REF="352"/>
of such a soil, its unremitted fertility cannot
be accounted for, from any supposed quantity of
vegetable food originally accumulated in it. It
is easy by manure to make soil too rich for
corn: it vegetates without end, and the seed has
not, before winter, time to ripen. But suppo∣sing
the richest soil to be proper for corn; yet
that vegetable food, however great the quantity,
must in time be exhausted by cropping. Some
other provision therefore must be made by nature
for the nourishment of plants, beside the vege∣table
food originally created.</P>
<P>Immense is the quantity of corn and straw, that
during a century is produced in a soil perpetually
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ertile. It is a puzzling question, whence pro∣ceeds
such a quantity of matter; for a new crea∣tion
cannot be admitted. A perpetual effect must
have a perpetual cause: the soil must receive ad∣ditions
without end, to restore what is taken a∣way
in corn without end. I am aware, that the
smallest portion of matter may by division be made
to occupy space without bounds. But observe,
that the difficulty arises from weight, not from
bulk. Corn is a weighty substance; and the
corn produced on this globe from the beginning,
must amount to a weight above computation: the
small portion restored to the ground in manure,
is a mere atom in comparison. I have endea∣voured
above to evince, that earth is not convert∣ed
into corn: and here is an additional proof;
for such conversion would exhibit a very new
<PB N="327" REF="353"/>
scene: instead of the hills sinking down gradually
into the vallies, the vallies would sink rapidly
down from the hills. A perpetual effect, I have
observed, must have a perpetual cause: to pre∣serve
a soil perpetually fertile, there must be a
continual influx of vegetable food, to supply what
is taken away by cropping. Whence comes that
vegetable food? where is it stored up?</P>
<P>Air and water contribute to vegetation: let us
try to build on that foundation. Supposing air
and water to be the food of plants, not meaning
to exclude what may be dissolved in them, the
difficulty vanishes, as air and water are inexhaust∣ible.
And why may not that supposition hold in
fact? I begin with air. Many plants grow to
perfection, without having any nourishment that
can be discovered but air only. The house-leek
grows from choice on a dry mud-wall, which
surely affords no nourishment. A species of the
sedum, requiring a hot-house in winter, is never
watered. The wall-flower grows luxuriantly in
the seams between large square stones in old
buildings, from which all moisture is excluded
but what is in the air. Various kinds of moss
grow upon hard stones, where they can have no
nourishment but from the air. It is an universal
opinion, that leguminous plants, before they seed,
draw most of their nourishment from the air.
Conformable to that opinion, Dr Hales, in his
curious Statical Essays, has made it evident, that
<PB N="328" REF="354"/>
every vegetable contains a quantity of air, which
adds to the weight as well as to the bulk. The
fixed air in a green pea, makes no less than a
third part of the weight. In wood, however old
or dry, air is found, very observable when set
loose by fire. Here is one inexhaustible store of
matter for composing plants.</P>
<P>Water is a still larger store. A plant regularly
watered, will grow vigorously in the most barren
soil, even in dead sand. In Persia, very little rain
falls during summer, and the land is burnt up;
not a pile of grass to be seen. But plants there
regularly watered, grow excessively. There are
many experiments of plants set in glasses upon
moss or spunge, which grow well when watered.
Some cotton was spread on water in a phial: a
pea dropped on it sprung, and pushed roots
through the cotton into the water. The plant
grew vigorously, and bears at present large pods
full of ripe seed. There is a noted experiment
of an oak growing in pure water to the height of
eighteen feet. Water is attracted by vegetables
of every kind; and is sucked in at the roots, at
the leaves, and even at the bark. The quantity
imbibed during a spring and a summer, is ama∣zing.
The quantity exhaled every day, is accu∣rately
measured in the Statical Essays mentioned;
which must be less than what is imbibed, because
plants do not throw off all they imbibe, part be∣ing
converted into their substance, and adding to
<PB N="329" REF="355"/>
their bulk and weight<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The emission of water from plants, is the occasion that a country abounding with trees, is more subject to damps, humid air, and frequent rain, than a bare conn∣try where no trees grow. The excessive moisture of the American air was a great annoyance to our first settlers; but the air became more dry, and the weather more constent, as the ground was cleared of trees.</NOTE>. The driest wood ac∣cordingly
yields, by distillation, a large propor∣tion
of water. A stream occupies the lowest
ground, without regard to soil; and yet the grass
on its borders is always more rich and verdant
than at a distance. A tree grows no where more
vigorously than at the side of a brook. About a
large stone fixed in the ground, the grass is ge∣nerally
the best in the field: for what other rea∣son,
than that the rain which falls on the stone
runs off to the sides? I do not say, that the heat
of the stone during summer may not contribute
somewhat. The north side of a hill, is observed
to be commonly better soil than the south side:
if there be truth in the observation, it must pro∣ceed
from moisture, less being evaporated from
the former than from the latter. Black solid peat∣moss
retains moisture like a spunge: trees grow
vigorously in it, provided they be sheltered from
wind; for their roots cannot resist wind in a soil
so tender and loose. On the other hand, no soil
is more barren than a gravelly or sandy moor that
holds no water; upon which the foot makes no
<PB N="330" REF="356"/>
impression, not even after a heavy shower. I am
busy at present in cultivating a moor of that kind,
upon which are scattered some dwarfish plants of
heath and bent, that leave half of the surface
bare. I judged that manure would not answer, till
the field should be made to retain moisture; for
which reason I incorporated with it a quantity of
soft spungy earth. I added lime and dung; and
now it carries a rich crop of turnip and cabbage.
The alteration of the soil is obvious to the eye;
and also to feeling, as the foot dips in it after e∣very
shower. Lord Bacon long ago gave his opi∣nion,
that for nourishing vegetables, water is al∣most
all in all; and that the earth serves but to
keep the plant upright, and to preserve it from
too much heat or too much cold.</P>
<P>To supply the endless quantity of moisture ne∣cessary
for vegetation, nature has made ample
provision. The continual circulation of water up∣on
this globe, from its surface to the atmosphere,
and down again to the surface, is justly admired
for the simplicity of its cause, no less than for its
bountiful effects. An elective attraction between
air and water, is the <HI>primum mobile</HI> of these ef∣fects
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edinburgh Physical Essays, vol. 3. art. 4.</NOTE>. Water is eight hundred times heavier
than air; and yet by that single power, an im∣mense
quantity of water is suspended in air; and
falls down from time to time in rain, dew, and
<PB N="331" REF="357"/>
snow, impregnating the earth with moisture. Dr
Hales, in a dry July, dug up a cubic foot of
brick-earth, weighing one hundred and four
pounds, which contained six pounds and eleven
ounces of water. Under the former he dug up
another cubic foot, weighing one hundred and
six pounds and six ounces, which contained ten
pounds of water. Under this he dug up a third
cubic foot, weighing one hundred and eleven
pounds and one third, which contained eight
pounds and eight ounces of water. Here is a
considerable stock of moisture, sufficient without
rain to afford vegetable nourishment several
weeks; not to mention what may be attracted
from below, by the upper stratum when its moi∣sture
is exhausted. Evaporation goes on so ra∣pidly
between the tropics, that to preserve
plants alive, moisture must be attracted from be∣low;
for, as mentioned in the first chapter of this
part, there is an elective attraction between earth
and water; and where a portion of earth is satura∣ted
with water, it readily yields its supersluous
water to a dry body in contact with it. This as∣cent
of moisture is promoted by the heat of the
sun, which pierces deeper into the earth than two
feet, according to experiments made by Dr Hales.
Were not plants thus supplied with moisture in
the torrid zone, where no rain falls for many
months, they would be destroyed by the scorch∣ing
heat of the sun. The evening dew that falls
<PB N="332" REF="358"/>
in a hot summer, is sucked up the following day,
without ever sinking to the roots of plants.</P>
<P>But though air and water are allotted by nature
as the constant and inexhaustible food of plants,
there seems to be little doubt but that this food
may be inriched by various substances dissolved
in them. We have seen above, that water im∣pregnated
with rotten animal and vegetable sub∣stances,
makes rich nourishment for plants; and
from experiments, other substances may probably
be discovered, equally efficacious. Plain water
may be sufficient for the stem, branches, and o∣ther
gross parts; but we have reason to think,
that richer nutritive matter is necessary for per∣fecting
the seed. Hence the imperfection of seed
in a rainy year, where the rich matter bears no
proportion to the quantity of water that passes
through a plant.</P>
<P>Moderate rain in a kindly season, warms tilled
land, and produces a slight fermentation. It is
here as in a dunghill: a very little quantity of
moisture has scarce any effect: a great quantity
chills the ground, instead of warming it. Differ∣ent
plants require different quantities of moisture.
Grass is benefited by all it receives; provided the
moisture exceed not so much, as to chill the ground
and the roots of the plants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A grass plant cannot retain so much as to hurt it: whatever is imbibed more than sufficient for nourishment, perspires at the leaves. There is a considerable lati∣tude in the quantity of healthy perspiration; which, in the sun-flower, by an experiment of Dr Hales, appears to be from sixteen to twenty-eight ounce in twelve hours day. And he adds, that the more it was watered the more it perspired.</NOTE>. So far corn re∣sembles
<PB N="333" REF="359"/>
grass, as to be slunted by lack of moi∣sture,
and consequently to blanch early. The
seed has more than time to ripen; but it is lank
and ill filled. Corn differs in being hurt by
much moisture: it vegetates continually; and
winter comes on before the seed begins to ripen.
Holland is a moist country: there is scarce a foot
of dry ground in it. Trees, grass, and vege∣tables,
grow there luxuriantly: but its fruits sel∣dom
ripen: and where ripe, have little taste.</P>
<P>Thus from air and water, with what they con∣tain,
there is an inexhaustible supply of vegetable
nourishment, which fairly accounts for the im∣mense
quantity of corn that is annually produ∣ced.</P>
<P>The sun joins with air and water in nourishing
plants. The green colour of plants is occasioned
by an oily substance, which can be separated by a
chymical operation; and that oily substance is ow∣ing
to the sun, for no plant is green where the
sun is excluded. The sun therefore contributes
to advance plants to perfection. And it is one of
the properties of leguminous plants, that their
broad leaves absorb more of the sun's rays, than
the narrow leaves of culmiferous plants.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="360"/>
According to the foregoing theory, the only
use of a soil, is to fix the roots of plants, and to
hold water for nourishment. But at that rate,
where lies the difference between a rich and a
poor soil? This globe is surrounded with air,
and rain pays not homage to one field in prefer∣ence
to another? The solution of this question
will, if I be not grossly mistaken, confirm the
foregoing theory, and evince that it is founded
on truth. Soils originally may have been very
different with respect to fertility, supposing vege∣table
food to have been unequally distributed by
the hand of nature. A virgin soil may be ex∣tremely
rich; witness the surprising fertility of
America, when agriculture was introduced there.
But cultivated grounds must long ago have been
deprived of that original food, in the course of
cropping; after which, it does not enter into
my conception, what other circumstance can re∣main
to make a soil fertile, but the holding water
in sufficient quanity for its plants. A clay soil
holds a great quantity; a sandy soil, very little.
Some soils there are singularly retentive of moi∣sture,
and that quality makes them long of dry∣ing:
such soils are favourable to vegetation; for
though they resist drought, they yield to the at∣traction
of plants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">May it not be thought, that the quantity of moisture which gives to a soil its highest sermentation, is at the same time the fittest for perfecting seed. However plea∣sing this conjecture may be, I dare not vouch it for truth: it must be left to experiment.</NOTE>. Other soils are very little
<PB N="335" REF="361"/>
retentive of moisture: they dry in an instant, and
the nourishment they can afford is very scanty.
Here the mystery is unfolded. The richest soil is
what gives the greatest resistence to a drying air,
and at the same time furnishes to its plants their
proper quantity of moisture. I have a thorough
conviction, that this property belongs to a soil
perpetually fertile: and it is to me a strong con∣firmation
of the present theory, that I cannot
form even the slightest conception, how perpetual
fertility can otherwise be accounted for; and as
little can I form a conception, how otherwise
countries, like Poland or Livonia, out of which
great cargoes are annually exported of corn and
flaxseed, should suffer no diminution of fertility.</P>
<P>To recruit with vegetable food a soil impoverish∣ed
by cropping, has hitherto been held the only
object of agriculture. But here opens a grander
object, worthy to employ our keenest industry,
that of making a soil perpetually fertile. Such
soils actually exist: and why should it be thought,
that imitation here is above the reach of art?
Many are the instances of nature being imitated
with success: let us not despair while any hope
remains; for invention never was exerted upon a
subject of greater utility. The attempt may sug∣gest
proper experiments: it may open new views;
<PB N="336" REF="362"/>
and if we fail in equalling nature, may we not
however hope to approach it? A soil perpetual∣ly
fertile, must be endowed with a power to retain
moisture sufficient for its plants; and at the same
time must be of a nature that does not harden by
moisture. Calcarious earth promises to answer
both ends: it prevents a soil from being harden∣ed
by water; and it may probably also envigorate
its retentive faculty. A field that got a sufficient
dose of clay marl, carried above thirty successive
rich crops, without either dung or fallow. Doth
not a soil so meliorated draw near to one perpe∣tually
fertile? Near the east side of Fife, the
coast for a mile inward is covered with sea sand, a
foot deep or so; which is extremely fertile, by a
mixture of sea shells, reduced to powder by attri∣tion.
The powdered shells, being the same with
shell-marl, make the sand retentive of moisture;
and yet no quantity of moisture will unite the sand
into a solid body. A soil so mixed seems to be
not far distant from one perpetually fertile. These,
it is true, are at best but faint essays; but what
will not perseverance accomplish in a good cause?</P>
<P>A soil is denominated fertile, that affords plenty
of nourishment to its plants; and accordingly it
is such a soil only that has been the subject of the
foregoing investigation. Plants that live mostly
on air, require not such a soil; witness the house∣leek
mentioned above. Juniper thrives on the
top of a mountain, in the poorest and driest soil;
<PB N="337" REF="363"/>
because, in that situation, it is sufficiently supplied
with moisture from the air. If planted in a dry
climate, it requires a moist soil, to supply the want
of a moist atmosphere. The nature of the yew
is the same. Planted in a valley, it requires a
damp soil. It will grow in the driest soil, as in
the cleft of a rock; but then it must be at such a
height, as to enjoy a very humid air. These are a
specimen of plants, that affect to grow in a soil
commonly reckoned barren. A soil that a mere
farmer would pronounce barren, is for many
plants excellent. How otherwise could the earth
be every where cloathed with beauty? How
great must be the diversity of soil, climate, and
situation, that can rise to perfection above 20,000
kinds of plants, to each of which is requisite
some peculiarity of soil, of climate, or of situa∣tion!</P>
<P>Whether the theory here exhibited will occa∣sion
any material alteration in the practice of agri∣culture,
must be left to the discovery of time.
Of one thing I am firmly convinced, that the in∣structions
above delivered, are in every particular
conformable to that theory. Take the following
slight specimen. Plants, like animals, cannot
live long in the same air: a circulation is to both
equally requisite. For that reason, the growth of
plants under cover, is slow; and seed springs
slowly in stagnated air. Conformable to this ob∣servation,
a free circulation of air for corn is
<PB N="338" REF="364"/>
warmly recommended; and there is a caveat a∣gainst
small inclosures, surrounded with strips of
planting, because they occasion a stagnation of
air. Impure air imbibed, renders a plant u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣healthy:
the grain has a bad taste, and tends to
generate diseases; which holds remarkably in a
fruit-orchard, if the trees be crouded, and the
walls high. Even grass, where the air stagnates,
is unpalatable and unwholesome. Next, with re∣spect
to moisture. No branch of husbandry is
more sedulously inculcated, than that of dividing
and pulverizing earth by the plough, by the brake,
by harrows, and by manure: it is the very life of
agriculture. And from what is laid down above,
it appears, that fertility depends greatly on that
practice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part 2. ch. 1. sect. 1.</NOTE>: it increases the capacity of soil to con∣tain
water: it envigorates its retentive power;
and it prevents the soil from hardening: to these
ends manure greatly contributes; and in that
view it makes the subject of the following chapter.</P>
<P>To aid the fertility of soil, the pickling seed has
been much practised. We listen readily to the
marvelous, especially where any great advantage
is promised. The boasted effects of the Abbé
de Valemont's prolific liquor, found many belie∣vers,
by which vast crops were to be reaped, with∣out
manure, and almost without ploughing. (See
Duhamel's treatise on the culture of land, vol. 6.).
<PB N="339" REF="365"/>
And the Baron de Haac's powder, is at present
no less successful in England. The credulity of
farmers might in some measure be excusable,
were such bold pretensions within the verge of
possibility. In every seed there is an embryo
plant; and the rest of the seed serves to feed that
plant, till it acquire roots for drawing its nourish∣ment
from the soil. The pulp is thus exhausted,
and there remains only the useless husk. What
advantage then can be derived from a prolific li∣quor
or powder? It may possibly render the pulp
fitter to feed the young plant, till it strike root.
That it can have no other effect is evident; first,
because it is exhausted with the seed; and, next,
that supposing any of it to remain, it can be of
no benefit to roots that are spread an inch, two,
or three, from the place where the seed was laid.
Yet books of agriculture are stuffed with such re∣ceipts.</P>
<P>I close this chapter with a reflection of the just∣ly-esteemed
Dr Hales. “Though I am sensible,
that from experience chiefly we are to expect
the most certain rules of practice; yet the
likeliest method for making the most judicious
observations, and for improving any art, is to
get the best insight we can into the nature and
properties of what we are desirous to cultivate
and improve.”</P>

<P>THERE are mutual connections between man
and the ground he treads on, that fit them for
each other. The dry part of this globe, is every
where covered with a <HI>stratum</HI> of earth, produ∣cing
vegetables for the nourishment of man and of
other animals. Some <HI>strata</HI> there are, so barren
as not to bear vegetables; and some vegetables
there are, that afford no nourishment: but both
are rare, and intended probably for other pur∣poses.</P>
<P>This <HI>stratum</HI> is commonly sufficiently deep for a
free course to the roots of plants: or it may be
made so by art, it being one of the many pur∣poses
of agriculture to deepen a shallow soil. A
deep soil, beside giving free course to roots, re∣tains
much water to nourish them. In Scotland,
partly from ignorance, partly from defect of
strength, it is the general practice to plough with
a shallow furrow, commonly under four inches;
<PB N="341" REF="367"/>
and hitherto the progress toward a better mode
has been slow. It is never difficult to invent rea∣sons
for justifying what we are accustomed to.
“If we plough deep, we are afraid of till.” And
what is till? Where ground is stiff, rain set∣tling
at the bottom of the furrow cements the
earth under it, which in time is hardened to a
stone; and it is this hardened earth which is na∣med
till. The earth is hardened as far as the
water penetrates, which may be one or two
inches; but after till is formed, every drop of
rain rests upon it without making any impression.
To subdue till is an important object; and luckily
the undertaking is seldom difficult: a strong
plough, raising it to the surface, lays it open to
the sun, air, and frost, which restore it to its o∣riginal
state. One precaution is necessary. Cer∣tain
earths, as hinted above, are averse to vege∣tation.
These must be avoided, however shallow
the soil be: but as such earths are rare, they
ought not to be an excuse for shallow ploughing.</P>
<P>The advantages of deep ploughing, are mani∣fold.
In the first place, roots extend far where
they meet no resistance; and the growth above
the surface corresponds to that below: roots
cramped in a shallow soil, are dwarfish; and con∣sequently
so is the tree. Dr Hales justly observes,
that the greater proportion the surface of the roots
bears to that of the tree, the greater is the vi∣gour
<PB N="342" REF="368"/>
of the tree, and the better able to resist the
attacks of an unkindly season.</P>
<P>In the next place, a deep soil affords not only
space for roots, but holds a due proportion of
water for nourishing the plant. If more rain fall
than the soil can retain, it descends to the bottom
of the furrow, where it lies lower than the roots,
or but barely touches their extremities: the sea∣son
must be very wet, that raises the water so high
as to do much damage. The disadvantage of a
shallow soil is in that respect very great. Roots
accustomed to earth are unqualified to grow in
water: they suffer when soaked in water; which
must often happen in a shallow soil, and is visible
above ground by a sickly yellow hue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part 2. chap. 1. sect. 2.</NOTE>. Upon
that account, Miller enters a caveat against over∣watering
transplanted trees: “it rots the young
fibres,” says he, “as fast as they grow.” Dr
Hales gives the same lesson. There is another
disadvantage of a shallow soil: the water lodges
so near the surface, as soon to be exhaled in dry
weather. Thus, the excesses of moisture and of
drought, are both of them incident to a shallow
soil. In a deep soil, water lodged at the bottom of
the furrow, is a reservoir, which is not exhausted
but by long drought. Lastly, a deep soil affords
space for placing the seed so, as that the roots may
spread every way: in a shallow soil, if the seed
<PB N="343" REF="369"/>
be laid so deep as to be sufficiently covered, it ap∣proaches
the hard bottom, unkindly to tender
roots.</P>
<P>So much for a deep soil. I proceed to other
advantages of ploughing. Stiff soil is not pene∣trable
by water: loose soil does not retain it.
Ploughing diminishes the tenacity of the former,
and opens it to receive water: it makes the latter
more compact, and increases its power of retain∣ing
water. Some earths fill not the hole out of
which they were dug: some do more than fill it.
Porosity occasions the former: the pores are di∣minished
by handling, which makes it more com∣pact.
Solidity occasions the latter: clay swells by
stirring; and continues so, till its former solidity
be restored by the power of gravity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This experiment ought to be tried upon ground that has rested many years. Among the causes of porosity, one is, the great number of infects that have their dwell∣ing under ground, and are expert miners. I speak not of moles and mice, whose subterranean walks and alleys are obvious to the eye; but of worms, beetles, ants, wasps, &amp;c. whose works escape observation. Their ex∣cavations may in a long tract of time render the soil ex∣tremely porous. The fine earth they dig out, is left up∣on the surface, and blown away by the wind.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Another advantage of ploughing regards clay
chiefly, which by moisture turns hard if not duly
stirred. This is an important article. Sand has
<PB N="344" REF="370"/>
no cohesion; and dry clay very little, if any<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part 2. chap. 1. sect. 1.</NOTE>.
It is water that cements clay; and in ploughing
makes it rise in lumps or clods, great or small in
proportion to the degree of cohesion. Ploughing
prevents water from binding a clay-soil: the su∣perfluous
moisture is exhaled by frequent plough∣ing,
and no more left but to give the clay a de∣gree
of cohesion sufficient for fixing the roots.
The nice point is, the time of applying the plough
after much rain. To plough wet, kneads the
parts together: on the other hand, the ground
must not be suffered to turn hard. Between soft
and hard is the proper condition for ploughing;
which may be known by the mouldering of the
earth that is raised by the plough. During win∣ter,
clay may be stirred in a moister state, than
during summer: frost prevents cohesion: heat
promotes it. The management of light soil is
very different. It is easily pulverized; but the dif∣ficulty
is to preserve its moisture. A long drought,
by extracting much of its moisture, renders it
the less fit for vegetation; and to plough it in
that state in dry weather, would render it entirely
unfit. The only remedy is rain; and if drought
set in, it ought to be rolled immediately after
ploughing.</P>
<P>The proper time of sowing and harrowing, is
when there is no more moisture than sufficient to
<PB N="345" REF="371"/>
give the soil a proper consistence; and I conjec∣ture,
that the same degree of moisture is the sit∣test
for making the seed spring. Reflect upon the
making of malt: a certain degree of moisture is
necessary for fermentation: too much checks it.
Let rolling immediately follow, to prevent as
much as possible any more evaporation. Where
seed is to be sown in winter, or early in spring,
it is right to plough sometime before, in order
that the superfluous moisture may evaporate; for
at that season there is no fear of exhausting the
moisture. But late in the spring, if the season be
dry, sow the seed immediately after ploughing.
The plants in their course of growing, return to
the soil, during night, part of the moisture they
draw from it during day. Their roots at the
same time, spreading in every direction, keep the
soil in constant motion, and prevent it from turn∣ing
hard.</P>
<P>I close this section with an effect of ploughing
the most important of all, because it holds in all
soils less or more. Ploughing keeps the soil loose
for roots to take their natural course, and open
for admitting air, dew, and rain. Dew in parti∣cular,
which falls in plenty during summer, when
most wanted, is lost upon hard soil, being exha∣led
by the next sun; but it sinks deep into loose
soil, and is sheltered from the sun's power.
Ground stirred before winter, is not only laid o∣pen
<PB N="346" REF="372"/>
to the action of the sun, wind, and frost, but
is early ready for a spring crop, beans for ex∣ample.
It soon wets indeed, but it dries as soon.
To drench in water ground left unstirred, may
require a month or two; but then, equal time
is required to dry it. The more earth is pul∣verized,
the more water it holds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part 2. chap. 1. sect. 1.</NOTE>; and the
more parts water is divided into, the more readily
it is imbibed by plants. If the ground be ren∣dered
too loose, rolling not only makes it solid to
secure the plants against wind, but also prevents
evaporation.</P>
<P>How beneficial it is to keep soil open for the
admission of nutritive matter, will appear from
the following facts. Stiff soil gains little by rest;
for as rain and dew get no admittance, they are
soon carried off by evaporation. But soil, if to∣lerably
open, improves by rest. I suspect that it
gains little by the pasturing of cattle; for what
they take away in fat with what they perspire, will
nearly balance the dung they leave: but it gains
by the nutritive matter that rain and dew deposit
in it: the rain may evaporate, but it leaves the
nutritive matter. This case resembles salt deposi∣ted
in the sea by rivers: water is evaporated
from the sea, but the salt is left behind; and
hence the saltness of the sea. The nutritive mat∣ter
thus left in the earth, is again deluted in rain∣water;
<PB N="347" REF="373"/>
and though not attracted by the air, is
attracted by plants, and enters into the ori<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ices of
the roots along with the water in which it is dis∣solved.
There is another cause that has a share
in the improvement of an open soil, and that is
air, which, with its contents, enters into the
bosom of an open soil by attraction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part 1. ch. 1. sect. 1.</NOTE>. The o∣peration
is indeed slow, because the attraction has
no effect but in contact or near it; yet in time,
the quantity of nutritive matter attracted with air,
may be considerable. Du Hamel reports, that
the rubbish of a mud wall made good manure,
though the mud had been taken from a very
poor soil. Grassy sod, used as a covering for cot∣tages,
turns good manure when it has lain
long upon a house. The walls of a fold for
sheep, being composed of sod, make good ma∣nure:
when thrown down and mixed with the
soil, they afford a better crop than the fold with∣in,
though enriched by the dung of the sheep.
Among many advantages of fallowing, the ex∣posing
to the air a new surface from time to time,
is one; by that means, every part of the soil
draws air with the vegetable food it contains.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>2. MANURES.</HEAD>
<P>THE operations of nature, hid from the igno∣rant,
and not always obvious to the learned,
<PB N="348" REF="374"/>
break out sometimes into broad day-light. Did
animal bodies after death wither and dry without
dissolving, this earth could not long have been
a habitation for men: their utmost efforts would
have been insufficient to remove dead carcases out
of the way. Happily putrefaction comes to their
relief: dead bodies dissolve and mix with the soil,
without leaving a trace behind. Putrefaction is
a curious process of nature: air, moisture, heat,
all of them, contribute; but too much, or too
little, is an impediment to the process.</P>
<P>On the surface of this globe, a process is conti∣nually
going on, unregarded by the vulgar, being
too familiar to draw their attention; and yet, il∣lustrious
among the works of Providence for its
benesicial effects. Plants and animals are gene∣rated,
arrive at maturity; and after serving the
purposes of nature, decay and rot. But the
process ends not there. Loathsome putrid mat∣ter,
from which we avert the eye, is made subser∣vient
to an excellent purpose, viz. renovation of
plants; and the process goes on without end.</P>
<P>Manures are of two kinds. One attracts wa∣ter
and is attracted by it, dung for example, salt,
calcined limestone commonly called <HI>quicklime,</HI>
or simply, <HI>lime.</HI> Another neither attracts water
nor is attracted by it, shell-marl for example, clay-marl,
stone-marl, raw <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one beat into pow∣der.</P>
<P>Of all manures, dung is the most universal. A
<PB N="349" REF="375"/>
soil naturally stiff turns free and open, in propor∣tion
to the quantity of dung bestowed on it. Re∣duce
clay into a dry powder: moisten it with wa∣ter,
and form it into a ball: repeat the operation
at pleasure, it still returns to its original hardness.
But moisten it once or twice with the juice of a
dunghill, it becomes mellow, and never recovers
its hardness. Dung therefore renders clay fertile,
by opening it and giving admission to water. It
does more: it makes every soil retentive of water.
Examine a kitchen-garden that has been often
dunged in the course of cropping: it will be found
moist above any neighbouring ground of the fame
original soil.</P>
<P>As dung is composed of putrefied vegetables or
of animal excrements, it is natural to think that it
contains more or less vegetable food. This how∣ever
goes not beyond a conjecture: a plant or an
animal may contain abundance of vegetable food;
but we are not certain that this is the case after
putrefaction: it may by that process be converted
into a different substance: such conversions in na∣tural
operations, are far from being rare. But if
vegetable food be contained in dung, which is the
most likely, another use of it is to deposit in the
ground its vegetable food, which, being dissolved
in water, is imbibed by plants, and converted into
their substance. And from an experiment men∣tioned
above it appears, that water impregnated
<PB N="350" REF="376"/>
with dung, is of all the greatest nourisher of
plants.</P>
<P>A third use of dung is, to promote vegetation
by raising a kindly heat in the ground. The sun∣rays
produce the same effect upon ground render∣ed
black by culture; for it is a property of all
black bodies to attract and absorb rays of the
sun<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part 2. chap. 1. sect. 1.</NOTE>. Heat is best promoted by hot dung;
which therefore seems the most proper for corn.
Whether hot dung be the best for making a soil
retentive of moisture, remains to be ascertained
by experiments. But I incline to think, that
dung thoroughly putrefied, and consequently cool,
is in its best condition for grass; as it can be e∣qually
spread to give every plant its share. It is
also in its best condition for a kitchen-garden:
green dung infects pot-herbs with an unsavoury
taste, and sometimes with a disagreeable smell.</P>
<P>Let a dunghill remain years without stirring:
it is reduced in appearance to fine earth; which
however has very little natural earth in it, as there
is very little natural earth in vegetables, or in ani∣mals
that feed on vegetables. Very few natural
earths equal this vegetable earth in fertility: and it
is a kind dispensation of Providence, not only that
dung is a great fertilizer, but that when it be∣comes
vegetable earth, it proves the best soil for
vegetables. In corn-countries, the surface-earth
<PB N="351" REF="377"/>
comes in time to be mostly vegetable: were it
inferior to natural earth, corn-countries would
long ago have been rendered barren and unfit for
agriculture.</P>
<P>From dung I proceed to other manures. Lime∣stone,
shell-marl, clay-marl, stone-marl, are all
of them a composition of calcarious earth with
other substances. Sand with calcarious earth
makes limestone<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have heard of limestone almost entirely calcarious, with little or no mixture of sand.</NOTE>. The shells of fish are almost
entirely calcarious; and these shells softened and
reduced to powder in water, are called <HI>shell-marl.</HI>
Clay-marl is a composition of calcarious earth and
clay. Stone-marl is a composition of clay, sand,
and calcarious earth: it is the sand that hardens
it; and according to the proportion of sand, it
approaches to limestone or to clay-marl<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Dr Ainslie's accurate essay on marl. Edinburgh Essays physical and literary, vol. 3. art. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is observed above, that powdered clay is
suspended in water, till by the superior force of
gravity it fall to the bottom<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Part 2. chap. 1. sect. 1.</NOTE>. But, as far as I
know, water has not the power of dissolving any
sort of earth, calcined limestone alone excepted.
A small quantity of calcined limestone, a pound
for example, will impregnate a vast quantity of
water, with no loss of bulk, and with a loss of
weight scarce perceptible. Calcined limestone
<PB N="352" REF="378"/>
thus impregnated, called <HI>lime-water,</HI> discovers it∣self
to the taste, though not to the eye. But this
effect is confined to calcined limestone; for be∣tween
water and calcarious earth in its natural
state, there appears no elective attraction: water
poured on shell-marl comes off pure, carrying no∣thing
along with it. Nor do clay or stone marl
differ, even when reduced into powder.</P>
<P>Vegetation is more promoted by weak lime-water
than by pure water. Two beans every way
equal were set in pots filled with earth from the
same heap: the one was moistened with lime-water,
the other with pure water: the first was
by far the quickest grower, and the most vigo∣rous.
Hence one benefit of quicklime: it con∣verts
rain into lime-water, which is a great fer∣tilizer.
This effect however is but temporary, as
will thus appear. Quicklime is limestone deprived
of its air, by the force of fire: but quicklime ex∣posed
to the air, attracts air; and in time be∣comes
again limestone as originally; consequent∣ly
unfit to make lime-water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edinburgh Essays physical and literary, vol. 2. art. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Quicklime may have an effect on land as well as
on plants. It is highly probable, that it opens
clay-soil to admit water that formerly rested on the
surface. How otherwise can it be explained,
that liming renders clay-soil drier? May it not
<PB N="353" REF="379"/>
also have the effect to increase the retentive power
of a loose soil? This seems probable, if what
Young the itinerant farmer says hold true, that
lime has a much greater effect upon loose moor
than upon any other soil.</P>
<P>Salt is powerful; and an overdoze of it does
more mischief than of any other manure. It is
soluble in water, and by that means enters the
mouths of plants. Its effect then must be the
same with that of lime-water; and considering
how sparingly it ought to be laid on land, it is
not obvious what other effect it can have.</P>
<P>As nothing can enter the mouths of plants but
what is dissolved in air or water, calcarious earth
in its natural state cannot enter. Yet shell-marl,
clay-marl, stone-marl, composed mostly of calca∣rious
earth, contribute undoubtedly to fertility.
If these manures cannot furnish nourishment to
plants directly, they must produce that effect in∣directly,
by fitting a soil to retain moisture, or by
preventing moisture from acting as a cement, or
by both. They certainly have the effect to keep
land from hardening: they render clay loose and
ductile, and prevent its being hardened by wa∣ter.
Whether they increase the power of any
soil to retain water, is left to experiment.</P>
<P>An overdose of shell-marl, laid perhaps an inch
and an half or two inches thick, produces for a
time large crops. But at last it renders the soil a
<HI>caput mortuum,</HI> capable neither of corn nor
<PB N="354" REF="380"/>
grass; of which there are too many instances in
Scotland: the same probably would follow, from
an overdose of clay-marl, stone-marl, or pounded
limestone. How is this to be accounted for? Of
one thing we are certain, that by such overdose,
light soil is rendered so loose, as to be moved by
the wind; and that even clay-soil is rendered so
soft, as to receive the impression of the lightest foot
at every step. Is it not then probable, that the
soil is rendered so open, as to retain little or no
water? But then, how comes the land to bear
any crop at all? I am reduced to another con∣jecture,
that ordinary ploughing once a-year, is
not sufficient to mix with the soil such a quantity of
manure; and that an intimate mixture requires
several years. Even a moderate dose of lime re∣quires
more than a year by such management for
an intimate mixture; for which reason, the se∣cond
crop after lime is always better than the
first, and the third frequently better than the se∣cond.
Now as the soil is opened by that part
only which is mixed with it, the cropping may go
on several years, before such a quantity of the o∣verdose,
is mixed as to occasion a total sterility.
This conjecture may be brought under the touch∣stone
of an experiment. Before or after harvest,
let an overdose of shell-marl be intimately mixed
with the soil by reiterated ploughings and harrow∣ings.
If the barley sown next season fail by lack
<PB N="355" REF="381"/>
of moisture, the conjecture will be converted into
a certainty.</P>
<P>Quicklime is of a nature very different from
calcarious earth in its natural state: by the latter,
land is rendered so loose by an overdose as to hold
no water: by an overdose of the former, it is
hardened to such a degree as to be impervious to
water or to the roots of plants. Several spots in
the Carse of Gowry, are thus rendered so hard
as to be unfit for vegetation.</P>
<P>The quantity of calcarious earth in clay-marl,
is frequently a half, and sometimes more. Five
hundred cart-loads of clay-marl laid on an acre,
are found not to be an overdose. Supposing the
half to be calcarious earth, and reckoning a cart
to hold six bolls; here are fifteen hundred bolls
of calcarious earth laid on an acre. Yet a far less
quantity of shell-marl has been known to render the
soil a <HI>caput mortuum;</HI> though there is not disco∣vered
any chymical difference, between the cal∣carious
earth in clay-marl and that in shell-marl:
they both equally are converted into lime by the
force of fire. Ignorance of nature, betrays us
at every turn to doubts and difficulties. May it
not be conjectured, that calcarious earth, by en∣tering
into the composition of an animal body,
becomes a more powerful manure than when
mixed with earth? There is an argument from
analogy to support that conjecture. Calcarious
earth changes its nature by the action of fire;
<PB N="356" REF="382"/>
and why may it not suffer some change by being
made part of an animal body?</P>
<P>Every particular in the present chapter, whe∣ther
relative to the plough or to manure, is per∣fectly
agreeable to the general proposition, that
air and water with what is dissolved in them, make
the nourishment of plants. To cultivate land in
such a manner as to retain a proper quantity of
air and water, is in all probability the chief or on∣ly
means for making it fertile. In that view, I
have all along warmly recommended pulveriza∣tion;
because the more a soil is pulverized, the
more water it will hold, and the more retentive
it will be of it. No mode of husbandry tends
more to pulverization than horse-hoeing; nor any
instruments more than the brake and the harrows
above described. Soils are very different with re∣spect
to their power of attracting and retaining
air and water. Let the diligent farmer make ac∣curate
experiments for ascertaining that difference,
and for increasing that power: no inquiries
tend more to the improvement of agriculture.
Our attempts to make a soil perpetually fertile,
will probably fail; but our hopes of approaching
it, may be crowned with success.</P>
<P>With respect to the contents of this Part in ge∣neral,
I have to observe, that in natural philo∣sophy,
of which the science of agriculture is a
branch, questions occur of two kinds. First,
will a certain event happen in given circum∣stances?
<PB N="357" REF="383"/>
Second, supposing the event, what
is the cause? To questions of the first kind,
the answer is <HI>fiat experimentum.</HI> All that can
be done with respect to the other kind, is from
a number of analogous facts, to form a gene∣ral
rule or law of nature. Such rules at the
same time ought to be admitted with caution,
even after the coolest induction. But those who
are ardent for knowledge, cannot easily sub∣mit
to the slow progress of philosophy: they are
always in a hurry to draw conclusions, and hurry
commonly leads them into error. Lord Bacon
fancifully compares knowledge to a ladder. Up∣on
the first step particular truths are discovered
by observation or experiment. The next step is
to collect these into more general truths; from
which the ascent is to what are still more general.
There are many steps to be taken before we ar∣rive
at the top; that is, at the most general
truths. But impatience makes us endeavour to
leap at once from the lowest step to the highest:
we tumble down, and find with regret that the
work must begin anew.</P>
<P>To conclude. Here is my theory of agricul∣ture,
displayed at full length; which is freely sub∣mitted
to the public, against whose judgement
there lies no appeal. But let it be kept in view,
that it is submitted as probable only, not as cer∣tain.
It would require the life of an antedelu∣vian,
to make all the experiments that are neces∣sary,
<PB N="358" REF="384"/>
for piercing to the foundation, and for re∣solving
all into clear principles. My life at any
rate is too far advanced, for an undertaking so
extensive. I found an impulse to expose this
theory, naked as it is; and I gave way to the
impulse, because I flatter myself, that it may af∣ford
some light in tracing the operations of nature.
One advantage it has above several other theo∣ries,
that it can be subjected to the touchstone of
experiments, many of which are suggested above.
By such experiments, sagaciously conducted, it
must stand or fall.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">IMPERFECTION OF SCOTCH HUS∣BANDRY.</HEAD>
<P>A Man can never have thorough confidence in
his road, till he be made acquainted with
the by paths that mislead him; and to be made
acquainted with the errors of our neighbours, is
the high way to good husbandry. My present
purpose, is to delineate the imperfect state of
Scotch husbandry, not only as formerly practised
every where, but as practised at present in most
places. To contemplate the low state of their
country in the most important of all arts, cannot
fail to excite ambition to excel in the few who are
skilful, and to rouse imitation in others.</P>
<P>Our crops in general are very indifferent; and
how can it be otherwise, considering our instru∣ments
of husbandry, which are sadly imperfect?
What can be expected from them in a poor soil,
when they perform so little even in the richest?
Our crops accordingly correspond to our instru∣ments.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="386"/>
From many examples it is made evident, that
our soil and climate are capable of producing
draught horses, patient of labour, and singularly
hardy. Yet the breed is so much neglected, that
they are commonly miserable creatures, without
strength or mettle. Did landlords attend to their
interest, they would be diligent to improve the
breed. Why do they not reflect, that the same
farm-servants with better horses, would double
the ordinary work? By improving the breed,
they would draw more rent from their tenants,
without laying any additional burden upon them.
With respect to oxen, there is no care taken either
in the breeding or feeding. How easy is it for a
gentleman to procure a good bull for his tenants?
and from the little care of providing food for
draught oxen, one would suspect it to be a gene∣ral
opinion, that they require no food. In sum∣mer
they are turned out into bare pasture, scarce
sufficient for sheep. In winter, a small bottle of
straw, not above a stone weight, is all that is al∣lowed
them in the twenty-four hours; which af∣ter
the turn of the year, being dry and sapless,
affords very little nourishment. What can ani∣mals
so sed do in a plough? And yet such is the
stupidity of many farmers, that instead of adding
to the food, they add to the number; as if it
would mend the matter, to add cattle that can
scarce support their own weight. One unaccu∣stomed
to see ten oxen in a plough led on by two
<PB N="361" REF="387"/>
horses, cannot avoid smiling. With his goad the
driver beats the horses, and pricks every ox as he
advances. He then runs forward twenty yards to
beat the horses a second time and prick the oxen.
Some of the oxen in the mean time, instead of
drawing, are found hanging on the yoke, and
keeping others back. It is indeed next to im∣practicable,
to make ten weak oxen in a plough,
draw all at the same time. Nor is this the only
inconvenience. A great number of oxen by such
management, is requisite for stocking a farm;
which is not always within the reach of the most
industrious. In a year of scarcity beside, the
beasts are actually starved. And what is worst of
all, the tenant, in order to get straw for his cat∣tle,
is commonly necessitated to thresh out his
corn, without waiting for a market, or having a
granery for it.</P>
<P>Our farmers, led entirely by custom, not by
reflection, seldom think of proportioning the num∣ber
of their working cattle, to the uses they have
for them. Hence, in different counties, from six
to twelve oxen in a plough, without any regard
to the soil. Seldom it is, that more than <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our
good beasts can be necessary, if the proper time
for ploughing be watched.</P>
<P>The division of a farm into infield and outfield,
is execrable husbandry. Formerly, war employed
the bulk of our people: the remainder were far
from sufficiently numerous for cultivating even
<PB N="362" REF="388"/>
that small proportion of our land which is capable
of the plough. Hence extensive farms, a small
part of which next the dwelling, termed <HI>in∣field,</HI>
was cultivated for corn: the remainder,
termed <HI>outfield,</HI> was abandoned to the cattle, in
appearance for pasture, but in reality for starving.
The same mode continues to this day, without
many exceptions, though necessity cannot be
pl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ded for it. But custom is the ruling princi∣ple
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> governs all. Sad is the condition of the
labouring cattle; which are often reduced to
thistles, and withered straw. A single acre of
red clover would give more food than a whole out∣field;
yet how common is the complaint of te∣nants,
that they are disabled from carrying on
any summer-work, for want of food to their
horses; a shameful complaint, considering how
easy the remedy is.</P>
<P>Custom is no where more prevalent than in the
form of ridges. No less high than broad, they
are enormous masses of accumulated earth, that
admit not cross-ploughing, nor any ploughing
but gathering and cleaving. Custom and imita∣tion
are so powerful, as that our ridges are no
less high in the steepest bank, than in the flattest
field. Balks between ridges are equally frequent,
though invincible obstructions to good culture.
It would puzzle one at first view to explain, why
such strips of land are left untilled. They must
have been reserved originally, as a receptacle for
<PB N="363" REF="389"/>
stones, thrown oft the tilled land; and husband∣men
were led by imitation to leave such strips,
even where there were few or no stones.</P>
<P>The proper time for ploughing or harrowing, is
when the soil upon stirring moulders into small
parts. This is not observed by farmers, so care∣fully
as it ought to be. How common is it to see
even a clay soil ploughed, when soaked in water,
or when hard like a stone. Little attention is gi∣ven
to what may be termed <HI>the frost-prepara∣tion;</HI>
which is, to open the ground before win∣ter,
in order that frost may pierce deep and mel∣low
the soil.</P>
<P>Shallow ploughing is universal, without the least
regard to deepness of soil. The temperance of
our people may be a proper subject for ironical
praise; for though nature affords commonly ten or
twelve inches of soil, they are humbly satisfied
with a half or third.</P>
<P>Ribbing is a general practice, though the slight∣est
reflection is sufficient to make it evident, that
to leave half of the land untilled, must be wretch∣ed
husbandry.</P>
<P>Summer-fallow has of late years crept in, and
is now common in three or four counties. In
the rest of Scotland, for want of summer-fallow,
there is a continual struggle for superiority, be∣tween
corn and weeds. Do not such provoking
farmers see, that it is fruitless to manure land o∣ver-run
with weeds? Do they not observe, that
<PB N="364" REF="390"/>
the manure they bestow encourages weeds as
much as corn; or rather, that it envigorates the
weeds to destroy the corn? Make a progress
through Scotland, you see stubborn weeds in e∣very
corner scattering their feed, and fouling the
ground more and more. It is an easy work to
cut down weeds before they go to seed. Would
not one think, that work so easy would never
be neglected? and yet it is never done. A
Scotch farmer behaves worse than Esau: the lat∣ter
got a mess of pottage for his birthright; the
former surrenders his to weeds, without any re∣compense.</P>
<P>There is scarce such a thing practised, as to
harrow before sowing. The seed is thrown into
rough uneven ground, and the half is buried.</P>
<P>The roller is a most useful instrument. It was
unknown till lately; and even at present is very
little used.</P>
<P>With regard to rotation of crops, a most im∣portant
article, there is great ignorance among
our farmers. As it would be tedious to enter in∣to
particulars, I refer to ch. 7. where that sub∣ject
is treated of.</P>
<P>Our farmers show very little skill in harvest-work.
I confine myself to a single instance. The
sheaves are bound up with a rope, composed of
two lengths of the corn, twisted together; which
makes the sheaves commonly of a monstrous size.
The binder, pressing hard with his knee, binds
<PB N="365" REF="391"/>
the sheaf so close, as with difficulty to admit his
finger. The weather must be extremely favour∣able,
if it be sufficiently dry in a fortnight, to be
ventured in a stack; it commonly must stand in
the field three weeks. Let any one consider the
risk of the crop in brittle weather, such as hap∣pens
ordinarily in autumn. Nor is this all. Such
sheaves are not only unhandy, but are apt to break
loose in carrying to the stack, or from the stack
to the barn. A sheaf should never exceed what
can be slightly bound together with a single
length of the corn: it is sitter to be stacked in a
week, than ordinary sheaves in three.</P>
<P>No branch of husbandry is less understood,
than manure. A dunghill is a very improper bed
for corn: lime and marl are still more improper;
for nothing will grow on them. Hence it is ap∣parent,
that the intimate mixture of manure with
the soil, is the great circumstance for vegetation.
In order to that end, the soil ought to be highly
pulverized, and the manure divided into its small∣est
parts. With respect to dung in particular, it
ought to be carefully mixed in the dunghill, not
neglecting to divide by the hand any lumps that
may be in it. Let our farmers say, whether they
are so accurate. Nothing more ordinary, than
heaps of dung withering in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ield, incapable
to be intimately mixed with any soil. Nothing
more ordinary, than dung laid on the dunghill in
<PB N="366" REF="392"/>
barrowfuls, without being spread or mixed with
what was there before.</P>
<P>A potato is a most useful plant, and, when
properly cultivated, affords a plentiful crop. It
is a great resource to the labouring poor, being
a nourishing food that requires very little cook∣ing.
We have been afflicted of late years
with very bad seasons, which, but for that re∣source,
must have driven many of our people
from their native country. Yet potatoes to this
day continue to be propagated in lazy-beds. Ex∣pert
farmers, not many in number, raise them
with the plough at the twentieth part of the ex∣pence.
This method has beside two other ad∣vantages:
it leaves the soil in the best state for
subsequent crops; and the potatoes are more pa∣latable
than what are raised in a lazy-bed.</P>
<P>Swine make a profitable article of husbandry,
very little attended to in Scotland. They are fed
at a small expence, and yet make most nourish∣ing
food. Every person who has a cow, ought
also to have a pig. This is universal in England:
it is creeping into Berwickshire, but in few other
places as far as I know.</P>
<P>Very few farms in Scotland are justly propor∣tioned:
some are too small; the bulk of them too
large. The former lead to a habit of idleness;
the latter into a habit of slovenliness, by want of
power to do justice to every part. There is not
an article in husbandry more essential, than to
<PB N="367" REF="393"/>
adjust a farm to the skill and ability of the te∣nant.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2">
<HEAD>ARTICLE II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A BOARD FOR IMPROVING AGRICULTURE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a maxim in politics, that every country
will be populous in proportion to the fertility
of its soil; upon which account, agriculture is the
most useful of all arts. And yet it is a sad truth,
that in Scotland, that art has not advanced far
beyond the first stage of its progress. In England
indeed, it has made a much greater progress;
and yet far inferior in perfection to English ma∣nufactures
and commerce. Agriculture is car∣ried
on every where without a school; and for
that reason, it is commonly thought to require no
schooling. Can a British minister embrace any
measure more patriotic, than to encourage agri∣culture
and its professors? No other measure
would so effectually aggrandize Britain. A small
share of the money and attention bestowed on
raising colonies in America, would have done
wonders at home. And yet, mark the striking
difference: our arts are our own, which we ne∣ver
can be deprived of while industry remains:
in the very constitution of our colonies, on the
contrary, there are causes of separation, that grow
<PB N="368" REF="394"/>
daily stronger and stronger; a wide-extended
country, a fertile soil, navigable rivers, and a
growing population. I disregard the present re∣bellion
of our Americans: for they will soon be
reduced to obedience. But as they derive from
Britain high notions of liberty and independence,
and as they are daily growing into power and o∣pulence,
the aera of their total separation, cannot
be at a great distance: it is indeed absurd to
think, that a great nation, in the vigour of pro∣sperity
and patriotism, can be kept in subjection
by a nation not more powerful, enervated by lu∣xury
and avarice. Let us not however despond;
for if agriculture be carried on but to the perfec∣tion
that our soil and climate will readily admit,
it will amply compensate the loss of these colo∣nies.</P>
<P>Books are useful for advancing husbandry, o∣therwise
this little treatise should not have seen
the light. But books are far inferior to living in∣structors,
who convey knowledge by practice as
well as precept. We have a board for manufac∣tures
and fisheries; a wise institution which has
done much good. Why not also a board for a∣griculture?
Is agriculture a less useful art than
those mentioned? or does it less require instruc∣tion?
Hartlib, in his legacy, laments, that no
public director of husbandry had ever been esta∣blished
in England. The present time is in Scot∣land
the happiest for such an establishment. Be∣fore
<PB N="369" REF="395"/>
the union of the two kingdoms, our people
were so benummed with oppression, that the most
able director would have made no impression.
Freedom has braced their nerves, and has made
them take heart to be industrious. They listen to
instruction: let them perceive their interest, and
they will chearfully practise what they are taught.
A board for agriculture, would among us have
wonderful success in many important articles.
Considering the quantity of waste land even in
our best-cultivated counties, it is not too sanguine
to hope, that our corn-crops might be doubled.
What a blessing would this be to Scotland, which
for many years has been reduced to import
great quantities? Our horses and horned cat∣tle,
are far inferior to what may be produced
by good management. Our sheep weigh not a∣bove
ten pounds a quarter, nor their wool above
two pounds. The soil by good culture would
feed sheep to the weight of twenty-four pounds a
quarter; carrying from six to ten pounds of wool,
which would be a valuable acquisition to the
woollen manufacture. Lambs, in several instances,
have been advanced to twelve shillings a-head,
and wedders to forty shillings. These are but a
specimen of the various improvements that might
be perfected by such a board.</P>
<P>The plan I have in view, is simple. Let the
board consist of nine members, the most noted
for skill in husbandry, and for patriotism. As I
<PB N="370" REF="396"/>
propose no reward to these gentlemen, but the
honour of serving their country, the choice will
not be difficult: in lucrative employments, perso∣nal
connections have much greater influence than
personal merit; and it is avarice only that sets peo∣ple
at variance. Where personal merit is the sole
object of choice, there is seldom much difference
in opinion. To ease the board in the laborious
branch of their business, they ought to be pro∣vided
with an able secretary, to minute their pro∣ceedings,
to write their dispatches, and to carry
on their correspondence, foreign and domestic.
As punctual attendance is necessary, the good be∣haviour
of such an officer may well intitle him to
a salary of L. 100 yearly; with the addition of
L. 30 more in a year of extraordinary business, at
the discretion of the board; but not unless all the
members be unanimous. A larger salary would
be an object of interest, and soon degenerate into
a sinecure.</P>
<P>A regular meeting once a month, may be suf∣ficient;
with liberty to those who have most lei∣sure,
to meet at intervals for expediting what
may require dispatch. It would cramp the pro∣ceedings
of such a board, to confine it to a quo∣rum.
As there cannot be any self-interest to create
a bias, those who meet ought to have the power
of the whole; and what they transact ought to be
final, if not altered by a greater number the next
monthly meeting.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="397"/>
The things necessary to be undertaken by this
board, at the commencement of their operations,
will require much labour and sagacity. The first
is, to make out a state of the husbandry prac∣tised
in the different counties; in which notice
must be taken of the climate, of the soil, of the
mode of cropping, and of the instruments of hus∣bandry,
noting the prices of all the particulars
that enter into farming. The next is a paper of
instructions for improving husbandry, suited to
the soil and situation of every district; with spe∣cial
reference to the present practice, showing
where it is defective or erroneous, and proposing
the cheapest and most effectual corrections.
These preliminaries being settled, the ordinary
business of the board, may be carried on easily
and comfortably. In the first place, there is a
necessity for an inspector, named by the board,
to make a progress from time to time in successive
places, for reporting the progress of the improve∣ments
directed, and for giving instruction in cases
that cannot so clearly be put in writing. In this
progress, special notice ought to be taken of the
best-conducted farms, whether by landlords or
tenants. A few silver medals bestowed on the
most deserving, will rouse emulation in all, and
promote industry. Second, this board will con∣sider
it as a capital branch of business, to answer
queries, and to solicit a correspondence with men
of skill. Third, they ought carefully to inform
<PB N="372" REF="398"/>
themselves of every invention that tends to im∣prove
the art, and to publish what they think use∣ful.
Fourth, premiums ought to be proposed,
and distributed among those who profit the most
by the instructions of the board. These premi∣ums
ought to be ploughs, harrows, carts, con∣structed
after the best models; which beside ex∣citing
industry, would be a means to introduce
the best husbandry-instruments. Fifth, in no o∣ther
respect would a board of agriculture be so
useful, as in directing proper experiments. A∣griculture,
though the prime of arts, is far from
perfection in any country. This in part is ow∣ing
to its complex nature; but chiefly, to the
length of time that is necessary to ascertain, by a
course of experiments, any capital point in theory
or practice. The life of man is too short for such
an undertaking. The only remedy is to employ
many hands upon different experiments; which
cannot be done effectually, but under the direction
of a board that never dies. Let lists be made
from time to time, of the points that are capable
to be ascertained by experiments: let proper ex∣periments
be suggested: let these experiments be
distributed among persons of skill. And when
their success is reported, the conclusions that
may be drawn from them, ought to be pu∣blished.
This would be the most effectual me∣thod
that ever has been contrived, to ripen know∣ledge
in husbandry. To enliven this branch of
<PB N="373" REF="399"/>
business, premiums ought to be proposed, lucra∣tive
as well as honorary.</P>
<P>To make the board proceed with spirit, a book
or pamphlet ought to be published annually, con∣taining
the transactions of the board, during the
preceding year. The profit of the work, is a
perquisite to the secretary; which will encourage
him to bestow his utmost skill in the compilation.</P>
<P>To procure public favour, men of character
and knowledge may be introduced by the mem∣bers
at their monthly meetings, to assist in their
deliberations.</P>
<P>The choice of proper members, is the capital
point: the whole depends on it. The choice is
the more difficult, as it must be confined to gen∣tlemen
who reside in Edinburgh, some part of
the year; because from others, punctual attend∣ance
cannot be expected. It would be unsafe to
leave the choice to members of parliament; who,
even against their private sentiments, are obliged
to solicit for their friends and voters, without re∣gard
to merit. The choice must not be left ab∣solutely
to the chief minister; who, at such a di∣stance,
is seldom personally acquainted with the
best qualified. The safest method I can think of
is, that the justices of peace of each corn-county,
should at a quarter-sessions name one. Out of
these, the minister chuses the nine members.</P>
<P>The choice of a member to supply a vacancy,
is a matter no less delicate. A society of gentle∣men,
<PB N="374" REF="400"/>
who serve for honour not for profit, appear
well intitled to chuse their companion. But to a∣void
faction, which would be ruinous in such a
society, the choice ought to be unanimous. The
dissent of a single member, need not be regarded;
but if two dissent, the choice must be in the
crown. If a member be absent three successive
monthly meetings, without an excuse approved
by the board, he is to be held as having deserted
his office, to make way for the election of a new
member.</P>
<P>The election of a secretary is a point still more
delicate. The board ought naturally to have the
choice of their own secretary; but in case of a di∣vision,
the dissent of three from the other six,
shall transfer the election to the crown.</P>
<P>The royal society in London, is perhaps the on∣ly
society in the world, that has flourished so long,
with no other motive but thirst for knowledge.
The members have now an additional motive,
which is the reputation of being enlisted in a so∣ciety,
so illustrious. In the present low state of
patriotism, affection to ones country is not alone
sufficient, to preserve long in vigour a board of
agriculture. Luckily, there is an additional mo∣tive,
inherent in the very nature of the institu∣tion.
Money is necessary to carry on the opera∣tions
of the society; and the distribution of that
money among persons of merit, will be a con∣stant
entertainment to the members. A great
<PB N="375" REF="401"/>
sum would be a temptation to misapply it. There∣fore,
no more ought to be put into their power,
than what is barely sufficient to carry on the ma∣nagement
with success. Beside the secretary's sa∣lary,
L. 500 yearly discreetly distributed may be
sufficient. And I boldly affirm, that such a sum
cannot be laid out with more advantage, whether
the public be regarded, or the good of a valuable
portion of our people.</P>
<P>The house possessed by the trustees for ma∣nufactures,
will afford good accommodation to
both societies; and several of the acting trustees,
are qualified to make a figure in both.</P>
<P>Zeal for the prosperity of Britain, makes me
ardently wish to have this plan extended to Eng∣land.
The English enjoy the reputation of being
excellent farmers; and so they are, compared
with their neighbours in France, Italy, and Spain.
They are however far, very far, from the perfec∣tion
of the art. A board for agriculture is indeed
less necessary in England, than in Scotland;
but that England would be greatly profited by
such an institution, will be acknowledged by every
one who is acquainted with English agriculture.
I appeal to Mr Young for the following facts, ex∣tracted
from his different tours; which, at the
same time, are but a specimen of much wrong
practice mentioned by him.</P>
<P>Seldom is a plough seen in England with fewer
than four horses, nor is it always confined to that
<PB N="376" REF="402"/>
number; and yet, seldom are more than two
horses necessary, if the plough be well construct∣ed.
A great sum is thus expended upon super∣fluous
horses, which wounds the public by unne∣cessary
consumption, is hurtful to landlords by
lessening their rent, and retards the progress of
husbandry. Among numberless instances, I men∣tion
the Isle of Thanet, where the soil is a light
loam on a chalky bottom; and yet with four
horses in each plough, they seldom pierce deeper
than three inches, which is scratching instead of
ploughing.</P>
<P>The number of draught-cattle is seldom pro∣portioned,
with any accuracy, to the extent of
the farm. Frequently, no fewer than eight
horses and as many oxen, are employed in a farm
of a hundred acres. With such an expence, the
land must be fertile indeed, if it afford any rent
to the landlord. In some farms not exeeding fifty
acres, six horses are kept. The using oxen in∣stead
of horses, and employing no more of them
than necessary, would be a saving to England of
several millions yearly. Were that improvement
accompanied with a proper regulation for the
poor, England would be in a higher state of pro∣sperity,
than is enjoyed by any other nation.</P>
<P>A skilful rotation of crops, is far from being
common. Instances are frequent in every part of
England of the following rotations, fallow, wheat,
oats, wheat. Also, fallow, wheat, oats, oats.
<PB N="377" REF="403"/>
Also, fallow, wheat, oats, barley. Also, barley,
oats, oats. Also, turnip, barley, oats, oats. E∣ven
the best soils must be exhausted in time, by
such oppressive cropping.</P>
<P>The great advantages of horse-hoeing, are a
crop, and at the same time a substantial fallow.
And yet, horse-hoeing, though invented in Eng∣land,
is not practised there. Many farmers do
not even hand-hoe their turnip-crop; and many
neglect to hand-hoe their bean-crop, after being
sown in drills.</P>
<P>The proper management of artificial grasses, is
far from being common. Of all grasses, red clo∣ver
is the most beneficial; and yet there are farm∣ers,
not a few in number, who banish red clover,
as hurtful by fostering weeds. It has indeed that
effect, if allowed to grow three or four years;
but why not change it every year? It is not un∣frequent
to see a field left to be covered with na∣tural
grass. By this slovenly practice, the crops
are not only scanty, but of a bad kind. In Der∣byshire
particularly, a field, after three successive
crops of oats, is abandoned to nature. Worse
husbandry is not to be met with, among the most
ignorant farmers in Scotland.</P>
<P>Draining indeed is common, but conducted with
little skill. There is no such thing known in Eng∣land
as drains at the surface made with the
plough; though such drains possess the advantages
of being cheap, effectual, and perpetual.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="404"/>
The foregoing errors-and imperfections, with
an endless number more, would be remedied by
a Board, eminent for patriotism, and for skill in
agriculture; and farmers would fairly be direct∣ed
to the road that leads to the perfection of their
art. Population and industry would be the con∣sequences,
with a great increase of the public re∣venue.
England would become so prosperous
and powerful, as to suffer little distress from the
loss of its American colonies, should that ungrate∣ful
people succeed ultimately in a total defection.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3">
<HEAD>ARTICLE III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">GENERAL HEADS OF A LEASE FOR A CORN-FARM.</HEAD>
<P>IN a lease of this kind, what chiefly ought to
be in view, is to restrain the tenant from
impoverishing the land, and yet leave him at li∣berty
to improve it; resembling a British mo∣narch,
who has unbounded power to do good,
none to do mischief. In this variable climate,
the tenant must not be tied down to invariable
rules of cropping: an unusual season, hot, cold,
dry, or wet, will necessitate him, for a year at
least, to abandon the best plan of cropping that
can be contrived before hand.</P>
<P>This observation is not intended to banish rules
altogether. Some tenants, like some kings, may
<PB N="379" REF="405"/>
be trusted with unlimited powers. But such
powers would be no less destructive to the gene∣rality
of tenants themselves, than to their land∣lords.
Tenants, therefore, like kings, must be
fettered; but in what manner, is a question no
less difficult than useful. They ought not to be
so fettered as to bar improvements; nor left at
liberty to do mischief.</P>
<P>Before entering into particulars, it must be ob∣served,
that diffe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent situations with regard to ma∣nure,
soil, and climate, require different modes
of husbandry. All that can be done in an at∣tempt
like the present, is to suggest a few general
rules, for a landlord to chuse upon in granting
leases. It is his business to judge which of these
rules will best fit his situation.</P>
<P>The first respects the time of endurance,
which, though an important article, is unneces∣sary
to be enlarged on here. It is believed to be
now the universal opinion, that without a long
lease, it is vain to hope for an improving tenant▪
The most approved time of endurance, as the like∣liest
to prevent waste, is to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix a time certain, sup∣pose
nineteen or two nineteen years; and to add
the li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the tenant who is in possession at the
expiry of the time certain. A man never loses
hope of living longer; and he will never run out
ground, that he hopes yet to be long in posses∣sion
of. By this means, the tenant is deluded in∣to
a course of management, equally pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itable to
<PB N="380" REF="406"/>
himself and to his landlord. But what, if, after
liming or other expensive manure, the tenant
happen to die suddenly before reaping any pro∣fit?
With a view to that event, let there be a
clause in the lease, for paying to his representatives
what sum the tenant's profit has fallen short of the
expence.</P>
<P>Second, Assignees and subtenants ought to be
excluded. For where a tenant has it in his power
to make his lease a subject of commerce, he will
be sparing in laying out money on improvements.</P>
<P>Third, Whether the rent ought to be paid in
corn or money, depends on circumstances. Corn-rent
cramps the tenant in his management; for
it obliges him to sow yearly corn of the same
kind with what he pays. Money-rent, on the
contrary, promotes good culture, in order to
produce the weightiest grain, the benefit of which
accrues entirely to the tenant. There is an ad∣ditional
reason for money-rent, that the tenant,
by prudence and patience, can draw a better
price for his corns at the home-market, than his
landlord can. The rent therefore ought to be
paid in money, unless where there is a superfluity
of corn for exportation; which can be managed
with more advantage by the landlord, who has all
his farm-victual to export, than by a tenant who
has but a small quantity.</P>
<P>Fourth, In this country, the profit of grass is
to this day not understood, but by a few. Corn
<PB N="381" REF="407"/>
is the object of the generality; and that wrong
bias ought to be rectified, by a clause confining
the tenant to a certain proportion of his ground
in corn, a third, for example, or a half. There
cannot be a general rule; because it varies with
the nature of the soil, and still more with the op∣portunity
of manure. But to give room for ex∣traordinary
improvements, an addition to the
proportion of corn may be indulged, upon condi∣tion
of paying shillings additional rent for
every acre above the proportion originally agreed
on.</P>
<P>Fifth, A clause prohibiting white corn-crops to
be taken in immediate succession, will be an ef∣fectual
bar against improverishing the land. Pease,
beans, turnip, cabbage, and potatoes, are profit∣able
crops; and red clover may be more profit∣able
than any of them, by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeding all the farm-cattle
upon it, which will save many acres of pa∣sture.
This and the foregoing rule, without any
other precaution, will in all events suffice to keep
the ground in good heart.</P>
<P>Sixth, The following, or some such clause,
will excite a tenant's highest industry to improve
his farm to the utmost, supposing it to be only
for nineteen years. At expiry of the lease, the
tenant shall be intitled to a second nineteen years,
upon paying a fifth part more of rent; unless the
landlord give him ten years purchase of that fifth
part. The rent, for example, is L. 100. The
<PB N="382" REF="408"/>
tenant offers L. 120. He is intitled to continue
his possession a second nineteen years at the advan∣ced
rent, unless the landlord pay him L. 200. If
he offer a still higher rent, the landlord cannot
turn him out, unless he pay him ten years pur∣chase
of that offer.</P>
<P>Seventh, As both landlord and tenant are con∣cerned
in preserving the fences, both ought to
concur in the expence. Therefore, let the care
of the fences be trusted to the landlord's hedger;
and whatever work is bestowed on the tenant's
fences, shall be paid to the hedger at so much per
day. Where the preservation of the fences is left
entirely to the tenant, he turns careless, and does
things by halves; where it is left entirely to the
landlord, the tenant takes no care to keep his cat∣tle
from trespassing.</P>
<P>Eighth, In order to preserve to the landlord a
privilege to plant trees, which is commonly ne∣glected
in leases, I propose that out of the lease
be excepted certain spots, proper to be planted,
for shelter, for beauty, or as not being arable;
the landlord to inclose and plant, the tenant to
carry the stones that are necessary for enclosing.
To encourage him to preserve the trees, he is to
have the whole weedings for the purposes of his
farm. There may beside be added a clause, en∣couraging
the tenant to plant trees, by permit∣ting
him to cut them down for his own use. And
the landlord is to have his choice, either to pay
<PB N="383" REF="409"/>
for what are left at the tenant's removal, or to
allow him to dispose of them.</P>
<P>Ninth, In a tenant two things are required;
first, skill and industry for managing the farm;
and, next, money for stocking it sufficiently,
without which, skill and industry avail not. With
respect to both, our common law errs grossly.
As to the first, a farm can never be prudently
managed by a plurality; for there it holds, so
many men so many minds; and yet, by law heirs-portioners
succeed in a lease, as well as in other
heritable subjects. To remedy the common law
in leases that go to heirs, let it be provided,
that the eldest heir-female shall succeed without
division; or that the landlord shall have it in his
power to chuse any of the heirs-female he pleases.</P>
<P>With respect to the other, our common law is
altogether injustifiable, as it gives the whole stock∣ing
to the other children, leaving the bare lease
to the heir; without means to stock the farm a∣new,
unless other heritable funds be left beside
the lease, which seldom is the case. This is cruel∣ly
unjust, both to the heir and to the landlord.
The heir has not even the benefit of collation,
because it would bring a plurality of conjunct lessees
upon the landlord. The heir therefore is in ef∣fect
totally disinherited; as a bare lease is of no
significancy without money or credit. The in∣justice
with regard to the landlord is no less fla∣grant,
who has thus a tenant imposed on him,
<PB N="384" REF="410"/>
from whom no rent can be expected. To pre∣serve
the lease and stocking united, which must
be done by paction since law is defective, let a
sum be specified in the lease, such as may be suf∣ficient
for stocking the farm; which sum the heir
shall be intitled to demand from his predecessor's
representatives, unless the farm be left to him
with a stocking equivalent in value. And the
clause may be conceived in some manner like
what follows. “And considering that if the said
A. B. die during the currency of this tack, his
whole moveables, not excepting the stocking
of his farm, fall by law to his other children,
by which it may happen, that nothing is left to
the heir but the naked tack, without a stock∣ing
or money to purchase it; therefore, to
prevent this hardship, equally prejudicial to
the heir and to his landlord, it is expressly co∣venanted,
notwithstanding the time of endu∣rance
above specified, That this tack shall fall
and be extinct by the said A. B.'s death, un∣less
he make good to his heir effects heritable
or moveable to the extent of Sterling,
the parties being sensible, that a stocking pro∣per
for this farm cannot be of value less than
the said sum.”</P>
<P>Tenth, To render the removing of tenants at
the expiry of the lease more easy and certain than
it is by our law, and without expence to either
party, I propose the following article. Supposing
<PB N="385" REF="411"/>
a lease for nineteen years to be agreed on at a
rent of L. 50, let one, two, or three years be
added, binding the tenant to pay an additional
rent for these years, a half more for example, or
double. But with a proviso, that the tenant
shall be at liberty to remove at the end of the
nineteen years, upon notifying to his landlord,
three months before, his intention to remove.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PLANTS AND ANIMALS COMPARED.</HEAD>
<P>ANimals are provided with various powers
corresponding to their destination; some
for supporting the animal frame, some for gra∣tifying
desire. Plants, in all appearance, have
no feeling of pleasure nor of pain; and conse∣quently
no desires. But they are endowed with
powers for preserving vegetable life, as animals
are for preserving animal life. Doth not the
springing of the seed, the motion of the sap, the
production of leaves, flowers, fruit, &amp;c. proceed
from a power in plants; as the beating of the
heart, the circulation of the blood, &amp;c. proceed
from a power in animals? There is not an ar∣gument
for the latter that does not equally con∣clude
for the former.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="412"/>
Next, as to the power of loco-motion. That
power is more perfect in animals; but plants pos∣sess
a share of it, such as is necessary for their
well-being: they grow both upward and down∣ward;
and in their progress to maturity, they
are continually occupying new parts of space.
Plants, it is true, cannot, like animals, go out of
harms way; but it is curious to observe, how
they exert that share of loco-motion they are en∣dowed
with, to avoid harm. Upon the slightest
touch, the sensitive plant shrinks back and folds
up its leaves, similar to a snail, which on the
slightest touch retires within its shell. A new spe∣cies
of the sensitive plant has been lately discover∣ed.
If a fly perch upon one of its flower-leaves,
it closes instantly, and crushes the insect to death.
The nettle never fails to sting the hand that touches
it. There is not an article of botany more admi∣rable
than a contrivance visible in many plants, to
take advantage of good weather, and to protect
themselves against bad. They open and close
their flowers and leaves, in different circum∣stances:
some close before sunset, some after:
some open to receive rain, some close to avoid it.
The petals of many flowers expand in the sun;
but contract at night, or on the approach of rain.
After the seeds are fecundated, the petals no
longer contract. The common goatsbeard closes
up its flowers while the sun passes the meridian.
The pimpernel expands its leaves at sunset, and
<PB N="387" REF="413"/>
closes them at sunrising. All the trefoils may
serve as a barometer to the husbandman: they
always contract their leaves on an impending
storm. Some plants follow the sun, some turn
from it. Most discous flowers follow the sun;
which has been long observed of the sun-flower,
while young and tender. The leaves of the mal∣low
tribe, follow daily the course of the sun,
from east by south to west. Many plants on the
sun's recess vary the position of their leaves;
which is stiled the <HI>sleep of plants.</HI> Every bo∣tanist,
after Pliny, has observed this in a field of
clover. A singular plant was lately discovered in
Bengal. Its leaves are in continual motion all day
long; but when night approaches, they fall from
an erect posture down to rest.</P>
<P>A plant has a power of directing its roots for
procuring food. A quantity of fine compost for
flowers, happened to be laid at the root of a full
grown elm; where it lay neglected three or four
years. When moved, in order to be carried off,
there appeared a net-work of elm-fibres spread
through the whole heap. No fibres had be∣fore
appeared at the surface of the ground.
The red whortleberry, a low evergreen plant,
grows naturally on the tops of our highest hills,
among stones and gravel. This shrub was planted
as an edging to a rich border, under a fruit-wall.
In two or three years, it over-ran the adjoining
deep-laid gravel-walk; and seemed to fly from
<PB N="388" REF="414"/>
the border, in which not a single runner appear∣ed.
Were our London aldermen equally tem∣perate,
they might partake of turtle and venison
with safety. An effort to come at food in a bad
situation, is extremely remarkable in the follow∣ing
instance. Among the ruins of Newabbey,
formerly a monastery in Galloway, there grows
on the top of a wall, a plane-tree about twenty
feet high. Straitened for nourishment in that
barren situation, it several years ago directed roots
down the side of the wall, till they reached the
ground ten feet below; and now, the nourish∣ment
it afforded to these roots during the time of
their descending, is amply repaid, having every year
since that time made vigorous shoots. From the
top of the wall to the surface of the earth, these
roots have not thrown out a single fibre; but are
now united into a pretty thick root.</P>
<P>Plants, when forced from their natural position,
are endowed with a power to restore themselves.
A hop-plant twisting round a stick, directs its
course from south to west as the sun does. Un∣twist
it, and tie it in the opposite direction: it
dies. Leave it loose in the wrong direction: it
recovers its natural direction in a single night.
The leaves of all trees and vegetables, have an
upper and an under surface, which never vary.
Twist a branch so as to invert its leaves, and fix it
in that position. If left in any degree loose, it
untwists itself gradually, till the leaves be restored
<PB N="389" REF="415"/>
to their natural position. What better can an a∣nimal
do for its well-fare? A root of a tree,
meeting with a ditch in its progress, is laid open
to the air. What follows? it alters its course like
a rational being, dips into the ground, surrounds
the ditch, rises on the opposite side to its wonted
distance from the surface, and then proceeds in
its original direction. Lay a wet spunge near a
root laid open to the air: the root will direct its
course to the spunge. Change the place of the
spunge: the root varies its direction.</P>
<P>Such animals as are naturally weak, exert their
self-motive power to remedy that defect, by join∣ing
in society. Plants are not capable of society;
but several of them supply their natural weakness,
by exerting their self-motive power in a manner
that would do honour to an animal. The eco∣nomy
of scandent plants is in that respect admi∣rable.
Observe how they direct their course to
any thing that can support them. Thrust a pole
into the ground, within a moderate distance: a
scandent plant directs its course to the pole, lays
hold of it, and rises on it to its natural height. A
honeysuckle proceeds in its course, till it be too
long for supporting its weight; and then strength∣ens
itself by shooting into a spiral. If it meet
with another plant of the same kind, they coa∣lesce
for mutual support; the one screwing to the
right, the other to the left. If a honeysuckle
twig meet with a dead branch, it screws from
<PB N="390" REF="416"/>
the right to the left. The claspers of briony shoot
in a spiral, and lay hold of whatever comes in
their way for support. If after completing a spi∣ral
of three rounds they meet with nothing, they
try again by altering their course.</P>
<P>Nature has also provided a remedy for trees
that grow too fast in a fruitful soil. Some form
the upper part of the weak and tender stem into
a sort of screw; which is stronger than a streight
line. This among others is the case of the larix.
A tree bent by too fast growing, pushes out all
its lateral branches on the convex side, in a di∣rection
between perpendicular and horizontal, as
if it were expanding wings to raise itself up. There
are at Kames, elms that when twenty feet high
were bent down by overgrowing, the top almost
touching the ground. In that position they con∣tinued
several years, till they were raised by la∣teral
branches as above described; and they are
now perfectly erect.</P>
<P>The economy of some water-plants is singular.
As the <HI>farina foecundans</HI> cannot operate under
water, a water-lillie, be the water deep or shal∣low,
pushes up its flower-stems till they reach the
surface, and then flowers in open air.</P>
<P>The comparison between plants and animals,
may be carried a great way farther. There are
powers in every animal, to struggle for health by
expelling diseases. All that a surgeon can do in
the case of a broken bone, is to restore it to its
<PB N="391" REF="417"/>
natural position. Nature performs the cure, by
pouring into the broken part a liquid matter,
which, hardening into bone, unites the parts
firmly together. Sydenham, prince of physicians,
defines a fever to be an effort of nature to throw
out of the body what is noxious. The provision
of nature for restoring a maimed animal, is re∣markable
in the lobster and crab. The feeling of
these animals is at the tip of their claws. When
the tip of a claw is bruised or broken, the whole
claw falls off, and another in its stead quickly ar∣rives
at maturity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bonnet is strangely puzzled to account for this fact. He supposes, that numberless embryos of every portion of every claw of a lobster, were originally created; that every lobster is full of such embryos, so artificially placed, as that when part of a claw is broken off, an embryo corresponding to that part is at hand, which is put in motion in order to repair the loss.</NOTE>. Are not yawning, stretch∣ing,
sighing, weeping, efforts of nature to throw
off a burden? There are similar powers in plants
to remedy what is noxious. A wound in a tree is
cured like a wound in an animal: the separated
parts unite; and the tree is covered with bark as
formerly. If part of a branch or of a root be cut
off, the want is supplied by a number of small
shoots, issuing from the place where the cut was
made.</P>
<P>The foregoing facts exhibit a strong resem∣blance
between plants and animals, with respect
<PB N="392" REF="418"/>
to the self-motive power. The motion of the
heart in animals, of the arteries, of the intestines,
of the lungs, cannot be explained by any known
law of mechanism; and as little, the springing of
the seed in plants, the oscillatory motion of the
sap, the production of leaves, flowers, fruit, &amp;c.
These various effects proceed from a self-motive
power in plants, as well as in animals; and by
that power chiefly, are organized bodies distin∣guished
from brute-matter. A plant exerts this
power without consciousness, because conscious∣ness
is not the property of any plant. But so far
the resemblance holds, that an animal, though
endowed with consciousness, exerts the same power
blindly, without being conscious of the exertion.
The power is in both exerted uniformly without
interruption; and each individual may be consi∣dered
as a sort of <HI>perpetuum mobile.</HI></P>
<P>The power that a plant or an animal has to re∣medy
any disorder or hurt, differs from the power
of carrying on life, in the following particular,
that it is quiescent till there be occasion to exert
it: it is exerted by circumstances destructive to
the health of the plant or animal; and independ∣ent
of such circumstances, it would contradict the
beauty and order of nature that it should be ex∣erted.</P>
<P>There are other powers in animals termed in∣stinctive,
by which they act blindly without any
view to consequences: hunger prompts them to
<PB N="393" REF="419"/>
eat, and cold to take shelter, without reflection
or foresight. Instinctive actions differ from those
above mentioned, being attended with conscious∣ness,
though not with foresight: a duckling, e∣ven
where hatched by a hen, goes instinctively in∣to
water: it knows where it is going; but knows
not for what end. To instinctive powers in ani∣mals,
there are no resembling powers in plants:
we admit not in plants any knowledge or con∣sciousness.
Far less do plants exert any actions
that resemble voluntary actions in animals.</P>
<P>After much labour bestowed on botany, and
many volumes composed on that subject, it ap∣pears
very little advanced above infancy: no o∣ther
science has made so slow a progress. I praise
the diligence of our botanists: some of them have
great merit. But, as far as I understand, their
study has been mostly confined to give names to
plants, and to distribute them into classes; not by
distinguishing their powers and properties, but by
certain visible marks. This is an excellent pre∣paration
for composing a dictionary: but it leaves
us in the dark as to the higher parts of the sci∣ence,
such as are the most proper to engage a
thinking and rational mind. No person who has
given attention to the conduct of Providence, can
entertain any doubt, that the powers and proper∣ties
of plants are given for beneficial purposes.
Have we not reason to hope, that these purposes
will be unfolded, when botanists, tired of dictio∣nary-making,
<PB N="394" REF="420"/>
shall direct their enquiries to the
higher branches of the science. Then will botany
become an interesting science, not inferior to any
other in dignity and importance: then shall we
have occasion to admire more and more the wis∣dom
of the creation. How pleasant to have it ob∣served,
that the humblest plant is framed with no
less skill, than the most elevated animal!</P>
<P>So much upon a comparison between plants
and animals with respect to motion. Another
comparison occurs, no less curious, and still more
interesting, that the external frame is nicely ad∣justed
to the internal, so as to accomplish in per∣fection
the ends of Providence. No one who has
studied natural history, but must be sensible of this
agreement in the animal creation. How well ad∣apted
are the claws of a lion and the talons of an
eagle, to their rapacious nature. What sort of fi∣gure
would an innocent lamb make, or timid
dove, with such arms! The shape of a fish is vi∣sibly
contrived for moving in water: how ab∣surd
would the animal be, if it had an aversion to
that element. A duckling waddles by instinct
to the first water it sees; for whi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h it is fitted by
its oily feathers: such an instinct in a chicken,
would be highly incongruous. The hoof of a
horse<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> corresponds to his shallow understanding:
fingers would be inconsistent with the use that na∣ture
intends him for. Without fingers a man
<PB N="395" REF="421"/>
would be a miserable creature: he would always
be contriving, but without power to execute<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wonderfully shallow is the reflection of Helvetius, that the only excellency of a man above a horse, is his having fingers.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This truth would be equally evident in plants,
were their nature and qualities as well known as
of animals. A plant is an organized being, as
well as an animal: if the external frame of the
latter be adapted to its internal frame, can we
doubt of the same economy with respect to the
former? In whatever manner particles of matter
are formed into an organic body, of which we
know nothing, one thing is certain, that the or∣ganic
body acquires a nature very different from
that of its constituent particles, and also new powers
qualifying it for acting according to its destina∣tion.
The power of gravity, of resistance, of
continuing motion, essential to matter in general,
will never by any combination produce any thing
but motion; but the power of producing a body
similar to itself, inherent in all organic bodies, is
far superior to the powers mentioned; and there∣fore
must be a new power added in the formation
of every organic body.</P>
<P>As plants were originally created of many spe∣cies,
each species has powers peculiar to itself,
which preserve the different species distinct, and
<PB N="396" REF="422"/>
consequently preserve uniformity among the indi∣viduals
of the same species. These powers, va∣riously
modified in every different species, are ex∣erted
in the propagation of new plants, with leaves,
flowers, seed, &amp;c. peculiar to each species. And
as a perfect agreement between the external and
internal frame of plants, as well as of animals, is
undoubtedly the plan of nature, incapable of de∣fect
or oversight, it may be taken for granted,
that each external part contributes to the well-being
of the plant, and that any alteration would
be hurtful: to exchange, for example, the leaves
of an oak and an ash, would be prejudicial to
both, perhaps destructive. Were we acquaint∣ed
with the nature of different plants, we should
be able to account for the difference of size, of
leaves, of roots, of colour, and of seed. We
should also be able to explain why some plants
spring early, some late; why some are adapted
to a hot climate, some to a cold; why some
thrive best in dry soil, some in wet; why some
produce flowers before leaves; and why some ne∣ver
shed the leaf.</P>
<P>This speculation opens a wide field for observa∣tion
and experiment, that may worthily employ the
most acute philosophers. Why not then attempt
to peep into the nature and constitution of plants?
The best we can make of that subject, will, I am
afraid, be but guess-work. But fair and rational
<PB N="397" REF="423"/>
conjectures, which we may hope for, will give
some entertainment to the curious inquirer. If
we despair of acquiring such knowledge in the
internal construction of plants, as to explain all
the differences above mentioned, we may at least
hop to discover facts that will illustrate the agree∣ment
between external and internal structure. I
venture to suggest an instance or two. Some
plants draw most of their nourishment from the
soil, some from the air. Do not small leaves cor∣respond
to the former, and large leaves to the lat∣ter?
I have seen a house-leek growing vigour∣ously
on a dry mud wall, excluding rain entirely
from the roots. But it has thick leaves, and
many in number, which fit it for drawing its nou∣rishment
from the air. It is not the light, nor
the sun, that make plants grow erect, but the
appointment of nature. A scandent plant has a
tendency to grow erect like other plants; but as
it is too weak to stand erect, it has tendrils or
claspers, to lay hold of any support within reach.
Why do certain trees never shed the leaf, even in
this country? Is it not a rational conjecture,
that they are fitted by nature to bear cold, and
that the cold of this climate does not suspend
their power of drawing nourishment all the year
round?</P>
<P>Were this important branch of botany dili∣gently
studied, I fondly hope, that considerable.
<PB N="398" REF="424"/>
insight might be obtained into the nature of
plants, and possibly into their medicinal effects.
By that study, the natural history of plants may
become no less instructive and entertaining, than
that of animals.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5">
<HEAD>ARTICLE V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PROPAGATION OF PLANTS.</HEAD>
<P>EQuivocal generation is by all philosophers ex∣ploded
from animal life; but some continue
to hesitate with respect to vegetable life. Ani∣mals,
say they, wandering from place to place,
can stock the earth with their progeny; but plants
are fixed to the earth they grow in. It is urged,
that plants are never wanting, where the soil is pro∣per
for them; that islands raised by a volcano at
a distance from any shore, are soon covered with
grass; that mushrooms and other organized bodies,
spring from rotten stumps of trees, where they
were never seen before; that various plants rise
on the foundation of old houses, when cleared of
the rubbish; and that upon liming or dunging,
white clover springs up in the very central parts of
a wide extended barren moor, though the seed
of white clover has not wings to carry it to a di∣stance.
<PB N="399" REF="425"/>
To account for these singular facts, it is held,
that both plants and animals were originally or∣ganized
atoms or embryos, having all necessary
parts in miniature; that the earth, the water, the air,
are full of such atoms, which begin not to unfold
themselves into plants or animals, till they happen
to meet with a proper <HI>matrix</HI> or <HI>nidus;</HI> that in
their original state, they are too minute for any
of our senses, but that they become visible by ex∣pansion.</P>
<P>What means were employed at the creation to
cover the earth with plants, may be conjectured,
but is far beyond the reach of evidence. It is to
me a natural conjecture, that a number of plants
and animals were originally created, and endued
with animals were originally created, and endued
with proper powers of generation; and that from
these, all the plants and animals existing in the
world are descended. In that belief, I cannot
submit to organized atoms, because there is no e∣vidence
of them, and because they are unneces∣sary.
To illustrate this conjecture, I add the sub∣stance
of a letter I had the pleasure to receive
from and eminent naturalist<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr Walker minister of Moffat.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>“The doctrine of equivocal generation was
universally admitted, till about 130 years ago;
not, however, so much by the ancients, as by
the half-enlightened moderns. They saw
mites in cheese; and myriads of flies and creep∣ing
<PB N="400" REF="426"/>
things in a dunghill, or a putrid marsh.
Ignorance of the natural history of these ani∣mals,
made way for the conjecture, that they
were mere spontaneous productions, the effect,
not of generation, but of corruption. This
doctrine indeed was confined to these poor in∣sects,
and never was extended to a lion or a
horse. They did not advert, that to form a
maggot and an elephant, require equal power
and wisdom. The same distinction was car∣ried
into the vegetable kingdom. Because
no seed appeared to the naked eye in a fern, a
mushroom, or in any of the moss-tribe, it was
asserted, that none existed; and while the oak
and the laurel were dignified with generative
faculties, these humble plants were vilified as
the progeny of putrefaction. Equivocal gene∣ration
became thus an asylum for ignorance.”</P>
<P>“I am clear to banish equivocal generation
from vegetables, as well as from animals; and
I boldly maintain as a fundamental truth in na∣ture,
<HI>omne vivum ex ovo.</HI> By the <HI>ovum</HI> in
vegetables, I mean, a seed, or any part of a
plant that contains a bud, or is capable of
forming it. They are in effect the same; be∣cause
every bud, as well as every seed, con∣tains
the embryo of a future plant. I know of
no other way by which plants are propagated,
but by seeds, suckers, and layers. The last is
<PB N="401" REF="427"/>
imitated by art, in cuttings, grafting, and ino∣culation.
Some late experiments are mention∣ed
of propagating trees by planting their leaves;
but I do not believe it.”</P>
<P>“Plants, it is true, are destitute of locomo∣tion;
and by means of suckers and layers, they
can only cover contiguous spots. But nume∣rous
and wonderful are the expedients, practi∣sed
by nature to disseminate plants. Some seed∣vessels
burst with an explosive force, and throw
the seed to a distance. This is the case of our
whin: did the seeds fall perpendicularly down,
they would be suffocated in the heart of an im∣penetrable
bush. Some seed vessels open not
till wet with rain; but the seeds are found to
suffer by drought, and to require immediate
moisture when sown. The ash, and the plane,
have heavy seeds; but these seeds are supplied
with wings: a gale of wind carries them from
their lofty situation to a distance, and they re∣main
on the tree till the gale comes. The seeds
of humble plants, that they may rise and re∣move,
spread more sail to the wind: the thistle
spreads his beard; and away he travels to fix
his residence in remote parts. A plant of this
kind, <HI>Erigeron Canadense,</HI> was imported from
Canada about one hundred years ago, into the
Paris garden. It is now spread as a wild plant
over France, Holland, Germany, Italy, and
<PB N="402" REF="428"/>
it is said over Sicily. It is spread to such a de∣gree
over the south of England, as to be in∣listed
among the indigenous plants. Some
seeds, such as our clot-bur, are of an adhesive
nature: they lay hold of animals that come
near them, and are spread far and near.</P>
<P>Many other agents are employed by nature,
to stock the earth with plants. The sea and
rivers waft more seeds than they do sails, from
one part of the world to another. I have
found seeds cast ashore in the Hebrides, that
had been dropt accidentally into the sea among
the West-India islands. The island of Ascen∣sion,
is the dross of a volcano of a recent date.
Its immense distance from land▪ renders its ac∣quisition
of seeds difficult and precarious. I
know but of two ways for supplying it with
seeds, one by the waters of the ocean, the o∣ther
by birds. By one or other of these ways,
it has got possession of three species of plants,
and only three; a singularity no where else
known<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In no such island was there ever found an animal that was not imported. And why should we admit spon∣taneous generation, to be more possible in a plant than in an animal?</NOTE>”</P>
<P>“ The animal creation is supported by the ve∣getable;
but in return, vegetables owe much
of their progress to birds and graminivorous
quadrupeds, which are prime agents in the dis∣semination
<PB N="403" REF="429"/>
of plants. Many birds live on fruits
and berries: the pulp is their aliment; and
they discharge the seeds unimpaired, and spread
them every where. These seeds are heavy,
and unprovided with any <HI>apparatus</HI> for flight;
but the birds serve them for wings. Hence
may be seen plantations of holly, yew, white-beam,
rowan, spindletree, hawthorn, and ju∣niper,
formed by the birds of the air, upon im∣pending
clifs and inaccessible precipices. Be∣cause
the misselto grows upon trees, and has no
flower that can be perceived; it was reckoned
formerly a product of equivocal generation.
It was concluded that its large, round, heavy,
berries, were not the seeds of the plant, be∣cause
they might fall to the ground, but never
could mount up into trees. No berries are
more palatable to birds of the thrush kind; and
it is they who plant them on high and distant
trees. It is extremely remarkable, that the ve∣gerating
power of seeds, instead of being im∣paired
in the stomach of birds, seems to be
fortified. The seeds of the magnolia, import∣ed
from America, commonly refuse to vegetate
under the management of the most skilful gar∣deners.
But I have heard, that these seeds,
when voided by turkies, never fail to grow.
It is well known, that the dung of domestic a∣nimals,
while it fertilizes a garden, fills it
with weeds. It approaches to a miracle, that
<PB N="404" REF="430"/>
seeds should withstand the power of animal di∣gestion,
which no other vegetable substance
can do. Here is a measure laid down by Pro∣vidence
for the preservation and dissemination
of seeds, that I cannot reflect upon without
wonder.</P>
<P>In order to fill the earth with plants, any o∣ther
method except by seeds, suckers, and lay∣ers,
appears to me unnecessary, and therefore
improbable. Farewell then to equivocal gene∣ration.
I can scarce write of it, without be∣ing
a little ruffled; so ill it corresponds with the
more august and comfortable ideas of creation,
which have made a principal article of happi∣ness
in my life.”</P>
<P>So far my correspondent. I join heartily with
him in his conclusion, that the known means for
storing the earth with plants, which are conspicu∣ous
marks of designing wisdom, are in all appear∣ance
so completely adequate, that to search for
unknown means, seems to be an idle attempt.</P>
<P>Having thus restored the plan of nature, which
in the simplest manner employs seeds as the chief
means for propagating plants, we proceed to con∣sider
how seeds are formed. Many philosophers,
holding it to be incredible, that a plant, or even
an animal, should be endued with a power to
produce its own likeness, have embraced an opi∣nion,
that all the plants and animals that ever ex∣isted,
or that ever will exist, were formed origi∣nally,
<PB N="405" REF="431"/>
not plants or animals, but embryos of those
inclosed in an egg or seed, which when deposited
in a proper <HI>nidus</HI> or <HI>matrix,</HI> grow up to a plant
or animal, and then decay. And to account for
future generations, it is held, that every embryo
contains within it smaller embryos without end,
like cups of different sizes cased one within ano∣ther.
These philosophers must go still farther.
To account for each seed producing a tree, and
that tree producing seed, it must also be held,
that the embryo inclosed in a seed contains smaller
embryos decreasing in size without end; and that
each of these smaller embryos contains another se∣ries
of decreasing embryos, also without end.
Here are infinites upon infinites, without end. To
avoid the intricacy of infinites upon infinites, some
philosophers have varied the system a little, with a
view to render it, as they think, more simple, by
recurring to organized atoms, exploded above<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Bonnet upon organized bodies.</NOTE>.
But this system, not to repeat what is said against
it above, is only in appearance more simple: it
resolves into infinites upon infinites like the for∣mer,
and is in reality no less intricate. Take
any of the supposed embryos, hovering in air,
swimming in water, or fixed in earth: give it a
proper <HI>matrix,</HI> and let it become a tree with seed.
As each seed may produce a tree, and each tree
produce seed which may also become trees, it is
<PB N="406" REF="432"/>
manifest, that an infinite number of embryos must
have been contained in the first embryo, and an
infinite number in every one of that infinite num∣ber.</P>
<P>That every seed contains an embryo-plant, is a
valuable discovery in natural history; but that there
is a decreasing series of embryos within every
seed, is a mere conceit, assumed without the least
appearance of truth. So far from future plants
subsisting in a seed without end, that even the
plant immediately produced from a seed, does not
subsist in the seed with all its parts entire. The
plume and radicle alone subsist in it; and the o∣ther
parts are produced in the course of growing.
But let us give way to the supposition of an in∣finite
series, to see what can be made of it. Wri∣ters
stop short, and leave the reader in the dark,
precisely where he needs light the most. A seed is
laid in earth: by what mechanical power is vege∣tation
produced and continued during the life of
the plant? And by what mechanical power does
motion commence in the foetus of an animal, and
the blood circulate? When a seed happens to be
inverted in the ground, with its radicle above,
and its plume below; what is the mechanic power
that makes them wreathe about the seed till <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
radicle get into earth and the plume into air <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ?
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To ascend and descend is not the ultimate view in these two parts, but to get into the air and earth. As seeds are generally deposited on or near the surface of the ground, the plume ascends and the radicle descends. But pla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e a seed in an inverted flower-po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: the radicle ascends and the plume descends: the first pursues his road into the earth; and the other into the air.</NOTE>
<PB N="407" REF="433"/>
Unless these particulars can be accounted for me∣chanically,
in vain are embryos created in the brain
of visionary writers. They must admit a power
even in the smallest embryo, to expand itself in∣to
a plant or animal, where it happens upon a
proper nidus. I say, they must admit that power;
and yet the admission destroys their hypothesis,
root and branch. A seed thrown into the ground
would rest there for ever, were it not endued
with a power, to begin vegetation, and to con∣tinue
it. It grows into a tree: why may not
that tree be endued with a power to form its own
seed? If so, there is no necessity to go farther
back: organized atoms or embryos must vanish,
because there is no use for them. Power in a tree
to form its seeds, is no more extraordinary than
that of sucking juices from the earth, and con∣verting
them into its own substance, a power
that every plant is admitted to have. And if
plants have power to form seed, there surely can
be no hesitation in ascribing the same power to
animals. Can any thing be more simple, or more
agreeable to the analogy of nature, than that the
Almighty, who created plants and animals,
<PB N="408" REF="434"/>
should endue them with a power to propagate
their kind? Are we not informed of this by eye∣sight;
and can any solid argument be urged a∣gainst
what we see? Thus the operations of na∣ture,
when understood, turn out no less illustri∣ous
for their simplicity than for their extensive
effects.</P>
<P>I shall close this essay with a passage of another
letter from my correspondent above mentioned.
“As for the doctrine of organized atoms diffused
through the universe in order to be converted
into animals and vegetables, it is not counte∣nanced
by any thing within the sphere of my
knowledge. No facts are adduced, nor do I
recollect any, to support it. I adhere more and
more to this plain truth, that all plants and a∣nimals
are propagated by seeds, or analogous
organizations; which are formed out of unor∣ganized
matter, by the power of the vital prin∣ciple
of plants and animals, in the way of secre∣tion.
By analogous organizations I mean a
bud of a tree, a section of a polypus, and such∣like
organized parts, that are capable like seeds
of growing up into a complete plant or ani∣mal.”</P>
<P>“The secretory power of plants and animals is
indeed a wonder. A lyncean anatomist, with
his great magnifiers, cannot penetrate the dark∣ness
in which it is involved. The transmuta∣tion
of matter by animal and vegetable secre∣tion,
<PB N="409" REF="435"/>
is obvious to every eye. By what means
it is performed, seems to be that high legerde∣main
which nature will never reveal. But if
by this power bread and water can be changed
into flesh and blood, into bones and sinews,
into the Argus' eye on the peacock's tail; if by
this power simple water can be converted into
the hardest wood, into aromatic flowers and
rich fruits; I then cease to wonder, that the
same water should be converted into a seed, ca∣pable
of unfolding itself into a future plant. I
require no aid from vagrant organized atoms:
I see no assistance they can afford. I dislike a
hypothesis that appears not to have any foun∣dation
in truth, or even in probability.”</P>
