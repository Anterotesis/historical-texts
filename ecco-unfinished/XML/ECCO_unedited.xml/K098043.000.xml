<HEAD>A True and Faithful ACCOUNT OF THE <HI>CENTAUR,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">'</SEG>TIS with the greatest Satisfac∣tion, that the Proprietors of Mr. <HI>Jehan-Paul-Ernest-Chri∣stian-Lodowic Manpferdt,</HI> the wonderful Centaur, can at length inform the Publick, that, after all the Difficulties, Expences and Delays they have met with, in their At∣tempts to oblige their Country with the Sight of so great a Curiosity, he is arriv'd safe in Town, and will be ready to be exhi∣bited to the Publick View, at the Sign of the <HI>Golden Cross</HI> at <HI>Charing-Cross,</HI> on the Day of next Month.</P>
<P>Such a Wonder as this (the like of which has not, in all Probability, been produc'd
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
by Nature, for near Three Thousand Years last past, (at least as to Two Thousand, it may be affirm'd with pretty great Certainty, if there is any in History) after having been for some time the Admiration of most of the Courts in <HI>Europe,</HI> and for no little Time the Conversation of all the Learned in <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> cannot sail raising the Expectation of all the Cu∣rious. As the Proprietors presume so uncommon a Sight will undoubtedly draw together as great a Concourse of Nobility, Gentry and others, as any thing of this Sort that has been shewn in the Memory of Man, they have thought it necessary for them to take this Method of acquainting the Publick, beforehand, with such Particu∣larities concerning it, as they imagine every one will be curious to enquire after, but sup∣pose to be impossible for them to give any tolerable Satisfaction in, during the Hurry of Shewing; besides, they found it began to be time for them to contradict, in an authen∣tic Manner, the many fabulous Accounts of the Centaur which have been, it seems, industriously spread, by certain Persons, gifted with so unaccountable a turn of Mind, as to find greater Satisfaction in their own idle Inventions than from any Information of Truth. We will not pretend positively to charge these false Reports, however liable to Suspicion it may appear, upon the Own∣ers
<PB N="5" REF="5" MS="y"/>
of the Panopticon, Colossus, Sea-Lioness, <HI>Chien Scavant,</HI> &amp;c. but be they who they will, if they could be guilty of so much Malice, as to hope to deter the Propri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tors from producing to the World the greatest Wonder perhaps in it, after acquiring it at so great an Expence, they deceived them∣selves; for if Lies, Difficulties or Delays could have effected that, they must have given over their Project, so long ago as the last Year of the late War, when, after they had convey'd thro' <HI>Holland,</HI> as far as <HI>Wil∣liamstadt,</HI> and were actually weighing Mr. <HI>Manpferdt</HI> into the Ship, to their great Surprise and Mortification, an Embargo was laid upon them, under colour of their designing to act contrary to an Order of the States, in shipping him without paying Duty for him, as a Horse; which tho' perhaps it might have bore a Dispute, could never have been worth their while to have attempted; but when the real case appear'd upon enquiry to be, that a certain potent Prince the <HI>Dutch</HI> are suppos'd to stand in some awe of, was determin'd to force Mr. <HI>Manpferdt</HI> to serve in his Army as a Trooper, the Proprietors thought themselves oblig'd to make Use of the Means God had put into their Hands, of securing his Person to themselves for the Time he had made him∣self their Property; for which Reason, they are not asham'd to own, they had Thoughts
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
of getting him convey'd to the <HI>English</HI> Coast aboard a Smuggler, but he telling them very honestly, he would not undertake to deliver him safe, as the general Election was over, they thought it would be run∣ning too great a Risque for so valuable a Cargo. They next thought of embarking him aboard an <HI>Irish</HI> Vessel that lay in the Road, but the Captain had no sooner seen Mr. <HI>Manpferdt</HI> than he absolutely declared off the Bargain he had before made, saying, with an unaffected Concern they could never learn the Motive of, his Nation would never forgive him if he assisted in it, and he wish'd none of his Countrymen might owe our Centaur a Spight, or do him a Mischief, if ever we came to make him publick. Upon this Second Baulk, they were forc'd to put the only remaining Scheme they could think of into Execution, which was to convey him aboard in a great Chest, under the Name of Artillery for the <HI>French,</HI> in which they met with no Difficulty, the whole Peo∣ple assisting them; but the Captain of the Ship, who was <HI>English</HI> as well as his Ship, outwitted them, for having actually a Lading of Artillery for the <HI>French</HI> on board (which they thought he had only pretended, in order to facilitate their Design) he delivered them all up together at <HI>St. Malo</HI>'s, from which Place it was with the greatest Diffi∣culty they ever redeemed him. After hav∣ing
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
surmounted all this, and a great deal more, they little expected to have found their Consciences charg'd at home (as they have very lately done) by a Letter signed <HI>Whit∣field,</HI> beseeching them by every thing they hold sacred, and as they will answer it in Case of Failure, to forego the Advantage they may have proposed to themselves, by exposing their Centaur as a Shew, which the Writer more than fears will be giving an Encouragement to the most horrid Vices, among the fine Gentlemen of the Age, to which (he says) they are already only too much addicted; if not a Means of introducing new ones, to which they may be the proner, from an Appearance of Utility. He owns his Apprehensions are exceedingly heightened by the near Approach of <HI>Newmarket</HI> Meeting. In return to all which, the Proprietors only beg the Favour of Mr. <HI>Whitfield</HI> seriously to ask himself if he really thinks the present Mode of Vice can actually be encreased? or, if any Kind of it can be introduc'd new? and, whether the <HI>Appearance of Utility,</HI> as he is pleased to call it (by which he must mean, if he means any thing, the establishing a Breed of Centaurs here, as of Mules abroad) would not of itself be enough to deter even a fine Gentleman from a Crime? So that they have all the Reason in the World to flatter themselves, that if their Shew were of Consequence enough to bring about any
<PB N="8" REF="8" MS="y"/>
Change in the present Taste, it is impossible it should not be for the better; and that so far from being chargeable with giving a helping Hand to the Depravity of their Country, they should deserve Thanks for having diminished it, or at least turn'd it to the publick Advantage. So much for Mr. <HI>Whitfield;</HI> notwithstanding whose Remon∣strance, the Proprietors would not have so long deferr'd producing their Centaur to the Publick, (as is evident from the former Notice they gave, for the seventh of the present Month) if they had not thought it incumbent upon themselves to postpone it, out of Respect to a Troop of Persons of Di∣stinction, who thought proper to make a Shew of themselves at that Time. They own besides, their own Interest directed them not to let any thing so extraordinary inter∣fere with what they had to produce, as the first Run of Curiosity and Surprise, is the only Harvest they have to reckon upon from the Town, having constantly observ'd that very little Time is requisite to familiarise it to the greatest Monsters in Nature.</P>
<P>As this is the Case, it is hop'd it will not be taken amiss that Mr. <HI>Manpferdt</HI> is no longer shewn for Nothing, as he has been for this Fortnight past, in private, to many of the Nobility and Virtuosi, nor indeed has that Satisfaction been refus'd to any of either Denomination, except to Mr. <HI>Whiston,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="9" MS="y"/>
which was done by Mr. <HI>Manp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erdt</HI>'s own Desire, not caring, as he said, to run the Risque of seeing any thing that might hap∣pen to fall from him in Conversation, make its Appearance in some future Memoir, where the Shape it should come forth in would depend (whatever his Opinion might be as to Mr. <HI>Whiston</HI>'s Honesty) so much upon his Memory. Nor has any body been admitted to see him for Nothing, for some Days past, except one Lady, who it cou'd not be refused to, as she had come on Pur∣pose as far as from be yond <HI>Red-Lion-Square,</HI> upon the Faith of seeing him <HI>gratis,</HI> and gave her Word she would not have come upon any other Consideration.</P>
<P>But we have been hurry'd away from our main Purpose, which was the giving a particular Account of the wonderful Centaur, by two the most foolish and useless Motives imaginable, that of complaining to the World, and of justifying oneself to it; for to tell that one has been ill used, is to encourage others to serve you in the same Manner; and to justify oneself is destroying the only Chance one can have for Favour, which is never bestow'd, but upon the Sup∣position of one's being to blame.</P>
<P>We shall therefore proceed a little more regularly for the future, if we can, and here we imagine it will be expected of us to give some Account of what the learned Professor
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
<HI>Zeiglerus</HI> has already publish'd upon this Head in Two large Vols. folio, at <HI>Basle,</HI> 1744. It has not been easy for the Pro∣prietors to procure the Sight of a Copy of this Work, so few having reach'd <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> notwithstanding the ecclesiastical Censure it incurr'd for some Theological Disquisitions, it seems the learned Author has made too free with, as the Church thought at least, but when at last they were oblig'd with a View of it, by the great Humanity of Mr. <HI>Osborne</HI> of <HI>Grey's Inn,</HI> they found very little in it to their Purpose, except a short Narrative of the Birth of our Centaur, with which they were acquainted before; however, that the Reader may not suspect us of Indolence, in defrauding him of any thing material, for the sake of saving ourselves a little Pains, we shall present him with the Heads of the First Book only: Besides, it may be of Use in giving all those who design them∣selves for the Pen, an Idea of the indefati∣gable Industry requisite for those who pro∣pose to succeed in that Way.

<P>How cautious we ought to be how we charge Antiquity with Fable, for relating Things, the like of which have not happen'd in our Days, as if our own narrow Observa∣tion was the Test of all that had been, or could be in the World.</P>
<P>From our Account of this First Book, we are willing to flatter ourselves the Reader will excuse us the Detail of all the rest; what follows we are glad to have the Authority of the learned <HI>Zeiglerus</HI> for, who,
<PB N="14" REF="14" MS="y"/>
as he took the pains to convey himself upon the Spot, for his better Information, and as nothing material in his Account has been contradicted, by the many Letters, Certi∣ficates, and Attestations, which the Proprietors have been at the pains of collecting from thence, we imagine it cannot fail of command∣ing the Belief of every reasonable Reader.</P>
<P>"MR. <HI>Jehan-Paul-Ernest-Christian-Lodowic Manpferdt,</HI> the wonderful Centaur, was foal'd the 19th of <HI>May,</HI> N. S. in the Year 1735 <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This is agreed upon in all the Informations from thence, otherwise it would have been impossible for the Proprietors to have given any Guess at Mr. <HI>Manpferdt</HI>'s Age, as the Mark is entirely out of his Mouth.</NOTE>, in a Meadow close to the Jesuit's College, at the Foot of that Ridge of Mountains call'd by the Name of <HI>Wild-Schwein-bergen,</HI> in <HI>Switzerland:</HI> This uncommon Production was universally look'd upon in the Neighbourhood, as a Judgment upon the Farmer, <HI>Holtzbawer</HI> by Name, in whose Grounds he fell, for having one day refus'd the Provincial of the Order, who he thought used to borrow his Mother to take the Air upon too often, on Pretence he was oblig'd to take a Journey himself; the Farmer, either frightned at the Prodigy, being naturally a little superstitious, or perhaps, with greater Reason at the Re∣semblance which the whole College agreed in affirming they perceiv'd between the Filly-Centaur
<PB N="15" REF="15" MS="y"/>
nd <HI>Holtzbawer;</HI> or foreseeing the infinite Concourse it would occasion to his House, the Consequence of which he knew would be to be eat out of it, immediately absconded, retiring into the Heights of wild <HI>Schwein-bergen,</HI> where most of the Peasants have rather Hovels than Houses, for the Convenience of feeding their Goats in the Summer Season, and which they desert upon the first Falling of the Snows. <HI>Holtzbawer</HI> had no sooner disappeared than he was summoned before the R. P. <HI>de Sales</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Zeiglerus</HI> mentions a Report he had heard at <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e</HI> about this Time, as if this Reverend Father had been talked of there, to fill up the first Vacancy in the (titular) <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>, Pro∣vincial of the Order, the R. P. <HI>le Chasseur</HI> Teacher of Humanity, and in short all the R. R. P. P. of the Society, with the two Sindies, as many Physicians and one Surgeon. The Debates upon this Occasion, which are printed at large in <HI>Zeiglerus,</HI> take up be∣tween Sixty and Seventy Pages, but as they wou'd be of little Entertainment or Instruction to the <HI>English</HI> Reader, unac∣quainted with their Manner of Proceeding in Tryals, we shall satisfy ourselves with in∣forming him only of their Determination, which was to pass Sentence upon <HI>Holtz∣bawer</HI> for Contumely, in not appearing before the Court, in case he should be taken that he should make the <HI>Amende</HI> before the Jesuit's College, in his Shirt, holding a Candle in his Hand of Fourteen Pounds
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
Weight; afterwards be burnt together with the Filly-Centaur, and their Ashes thrown into the Air; that his Farm should be confiscated to the Uses of the Society, as well as the Mare which had produced the Centaur, to whom in their Mercy they remitted the Penalty of burning she had incurr'd, in Consideration of the great Ser∣vices she might be of to the Society, after she should be duly exorcis'd; the Execution of the Filly to be respited for Six Days, as well in hopes <HI>Holtzbawer</HI> might be taken in the mean time, as to give the Country an Opportunity of assembling at so uncommon a Sight.</P>
<P>During <HI>Holtzbawer</HI>'s Retreat in the Mountains, there happen'd to him an Accident so uncommon and so unparallel'd by any thing one sees in the World, that the Author <HI>(Zeiglerus)</HI> can't help appealing to his own Character, and asking whether it is at all probable, that with the Reputa∣tion he thanks Heaven he has established of himself where he is known, for a Man of Veracity and Plain-dealing, he should risque it all for the Sake of giving an Air of Novel to a History so well known and attested, as this he is compiling, if he did not actually believe what he is going to relate, and had not taken all human Means for discovering the Truth: it is this: that notwithstanding this Farmer was absolutely stripp'd of every
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>
thing he had possess'd, a Peasant (he had been remarkably kind to from his Infancy, edu∣cating him in his House, and behaving to him in all Respects in the most tender and affectionate Manner, even so far as to give every body Reason to believe he designed to to make him his Heir) instead of either seiz∣ing upon <HI>Holtzbawer,</HI> as he might easily have done, being a younger and stronger Man, or getting a Reward, for discovering his Hiding-place, as one would naturally have expected, not only faithfully kept his Secret, but was a means of preserving his Life, by the Advice he gave, which was, for them two to steal down privately from the Mountains, the Night before the intend∣ed Execution, and convey away the Mare and her Infant, by shewing of whom it was proposed to support themselves. This they happily effected, and by easy Journeys over those wild and uncultivated Places arrived safe with their Charge in <HI>Piedmont.</HI> It was thus the wonderful Mr. <HI>Manpferdt</HI> escaped the Fate that had approached so so close to him, while ignorant of what Sen∣tence he lay under, he was trotting, and crying, with his Thumb in his Mouth after the Mare his Mother."</P>
<P>Thus far the accurate <HI>Zeiglerus,</HI> whom we don't think it necessary for us to follow any farther in his Account of the Education of Mr. <HI>Manpferdt,</HI> nor what Courts he has
<PB N="18" REF="18" MS="y"/>
been at; supposing it suffices for the Reader to be assured, that he is now here.</P>
<P>There is one Thing however, we think we ought to warn all those of, who design us the Honour of coming to our wonderful Show, that notwithstanding the solid Sense Mr. <HI>Manpferdt</HI> shews upon many Occasions, we never could by any Reasoning, Persuasion, or Terror, prevail upon him to forbear Dung∣ing or Staling, before whatever Company happens to be present; but tho' we will not pretend to say, he is quite so inoffensive at such Times as those who are only Horses, yet as Persons always attend with Mops, Pails and Shovels of Sand, to remove instant∣ly whatever may be troublesome to delicate Noses, and as there is always ready a Cha∣fingdish with lighted Coals, to throw Frank∣incense upon, if any Thing of that Nature should happen, we hope it will not deter any body from giving us the Honour of their Company. Nor has any body hitherto of that extraordinary Number that has already been to see Mr. <HI>Manpferdt,</HI> expressed any remarkable Dislike at this Accident, ex∣cept a <HI>Scotch</HI> Gentleman, and a <HI>Dutch</HI> Mer∣chant from the City, the two People upon Earth, who, after having made Cleanliness a Plague to themselves and every body that comes nigh them, remain dirtier than their Neighbours. Another Failing Mr.
<PB N="19" REF="19" MS="y"/>
<HI>Manpferdt</HI> is unaccountably liable to, (tho' very easily prevented by the Presence of any one of the Proprietors with a Whip in his Hand, without which Precaution he will never be shewn in Public) is the Propensity he has to all kinds of Indecency and Lewdness in his Talk. This is what the Town will readily believe we should not have apprized it of, if we could not take it upon ourselves, to answer; that his Conver∣sation, while any of us is by, is nothing but what the nicest Lady may hear without blushing, even tho' her Father or Husband were present. We thought it necessary to mention this Article, as it is a Circumstance that has been endeavoured to be made an ill Use of by Persons hinted at above, who have aggravated it to so great a Degree as to have given out, that he actually put a cer∣tain Lady of Quality out of Countenance, by his Talk; which is a Reflection both upon her and him, that there is not the least Foundation in Fact for.</P>
<P>The Proprietors have agreed upon con∣fining the Time of Shewing, between the Hours of Ten in the Morning, and Four in the Afternoon, the rest of the Day being requisite for Mr. <HI>Manpferdt</HI> to comb and curry himself, and stir up his own Litter, and study the <HI>English</HI> History, which he begins to be tolerably expert in, tho' we will not pretend, but that he is apt to make
<PB N="20" REF="20" MS="y"/>
some Blunders in it, and when that once happens (from a kind of Stupidity in him, whether owing to the Horse, or <HI>Swiss</HI> Part of him we can't tell) it is impossible to set him right again, for he always reverts. Thus, tho' we have explained to him a hun∣dred times the Nature of the Union, he still persists in reasoning upon it, as of the Union of <HI>France</HI> with <HI>Scotland.</HI> Besides, he requires a great deal of time for his Meals, as he eats very plentifully, and pretty leisurely: His favou∣rite Diet is an immense Quantity of Greens, with boil'd Beef, or a Peas-pudding as big as a Peck and some Pork; which he does not eat together, but the Greens or Pudding first, and afterwards the Beef or Pork mo∣derately: As in Drinking, he will first pour down a couple of Gallons of Water, or, if he has a Cold, of warm Mash, and immediately after takes a Glass of Wine, or a Draught of Porter, in which he is tolerably tempe∣rate; the immense Quantity of Claret re∣ported to have been drank between a Right Honourable as well as Right Learned Person and him, being a downright Forgery; the more malicious, as it is partly founded upon Truth: For tho' Mr. <HI>Manpferdt</HI> was per∣fectly fober at breaking up, yet People would not believe but he must be drunk, as he seemed to rely upon a Promise, the Right Honourable Person had seriously made him
<PB N="21" REF="21" MS="y"/>
before they began to drink, of getting him a Run at fresh Grass this Spring.</P>
<P>The Proprietors will not trouble the Pub∣lic, with any farther Detail of Mr. <HI>Manp∣ferdt</HI> at present, as it will be, in so short a Time, capable of making a Judgment of him for itself. If therefore we suppress any other Particularities and Oddities of his, it is not from any Desire of concealing them, knowing that they must rather recommend than depreciate him to a FREE PEOPLE, who place the only Advantage they have by being such, in daring to indulge them∣selves in every Oddity that comes into their Heads; and we are willing to believe, that when the rest come to be known, they will be of no more Prejudice to us, than we find one already mentioned, his Licentious∣ness in Talk is likely to be of: For notwith∣standing that has been so maliciously spread, and universally known, we hear that many Ladies are desirous of a private Conversation with him; for which Reason it is thought proper to give this Notice, that one may be bespoke at any Time, after this present Month of <HI>March,</HI> upon only sending Word the Evening before, and appointing the Hour, and leaving Five Guineas by the Messenger.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Manpferdt</HI> proposes, as soon as the Time of his Engagement to us, shall be expired, to let himself out by the Morning
<PB N="22" REF="22"/>
to Ladies, who shall be disposed for an Airing in <HI>Hyde-park,</HI> the King's Roads, or any Jaunt within Five Miles of Town. He has all his Paces exceeding easy, and is not at all subject to trip: He will fix a certain Rate for his Carriage by the Hour, and leave to their Generosity to give him whatever they please for his Trouble of At∣tendance. He hopes this Design of his, will raise no new Objection in the City, to the Naturalization Act, of which tho' he pro∣poses to take the Benefit; yet he is willing to give any Secrity, which shall be required, that he will not carry any Ladies from that Part of the Town, 'till they are become People of Quality.</P>
<P>The Proprietors flatter themselves, that considering the vast Charges they have been at, it will not be thought dear, if they fix the Price, of seeing the <HI>Centaur</HI> at <HI>Five Shillings</HI> each, to the Nobility and Gentry; others will be admitted for <HI>One Shilling:</HI> and we trust to the Generosity of the former two, that they will not impose upon those ap∣pointed for Receivers at the Door, by being better dressed than usually of Mornings.</P>
<P>All Persons are desired not to give them∣selves the Trouble of coming before the first of next Month, as they can upon no Consi∣deration whatever be admitted.</P>
